["J. Christian Adams, a former Department of Justice (DOJ) official, told Breitbart News Tonight that President Donald Trump\u2019s next attorney general should be someone with DOJ experience who knows what needs to be done to clean up the department\u2019s institutional corruption.\n\nAdams, the author of Injustice: Exposing the Racial Agenda of the Obama Justice Department, discussed out-going Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019 tenure at DOJ in an interview Wednesday on SiriusXM\u2019s Breitbart News Tonight with hosts Rebecca Mansour and Joel Pollak. Sessions announced his resignation as attorney general earlier that day.\n\nAdams recalled, \u201cI go back to the original press conference where Sessions recused himself [from overseeing Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia collusion investigation]. If you were to go watch that, you would see something very interesting happen. He immediately referred to his chief of staff, Jody Hunt. I know Jody Hunt. I\u2019ve had some dealings with him. \u2026 [Session] said how Jody Hunt is a long-time career employee at the Justice Department, and he almost used him like a prop, like, \u2018Hey, look how fair and impartial I am because Jody Hunt is here.\u2019 Jody Hunt survived the Obama years. He was a top leader inside the Holder Justice Department, and the way Sessions [put] Jody Hunt out there at that presser really disturbed me, because it told me that Jody Hunt had an inordinate amount of power inside the attorney general\u2019s office.\u201d\n\nLISTEN:\n\n\n\nAdams explained that the problems with the Mueller investigation started with the decision to have Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein oversee it, because, according to Adams, Rosenstein\u2019s deputies are \u201cleftists\u201d who aggressively shielded Mueller\u2019s probe from accountability.\n\nAdams said, \u201cRosenstein gets appointed and Rosenstein effectively runs the Mueller investigation, and I have sourcing inside Rosenstein\u2019s world and office that basically [confirms that] all these deputies inside of Rosenstein\u2019s office who are leftists, Soros fellows. Literally, one of them is a Soros scholar, and they essentially had sharp elbows, and any time anybody tried to do anything to that [Mueller] investigation \u2014 basically make it behave, not even shut it down, but make it play by the rules \u2014 these guys would kick and scream and threaten, and that\u2019s really where the problem was. By August [the Mueller investigation] was untenable, because Rosenstein had been given too much freedom.\u201d\n\nAdams said the key to cleaning up the Justice Department\u2019s excesses is for Trump to appoint someone who understands the institutional problems within DOJ and can therefore reform it and root out the \u201ccareerists\u201d who are not truly \u201cConstitutionalists.\u201d\n\nAdams said, \u201cI\u2019m going to say something that will be counter intuitive to a lot of your listeners. Trump has got to pick somebody with Justice Department experience, because one of the ways you gets railroaded as an incoming political appointee at DOJ is if you don\u2019t know how the show works, if you don\u2019t know the lexicon, and if you don\u2019t know all the tricks of delaying and suppressing policy initiatives inside the department. If you don\u2019t know that, you\u2019ve got a learning curve of like nine months. So you really need somebody who knows the department in order to reform the department.\u201d\n\nAdams added, \u201cYou also can\u2019t have some top lawyer guy from Manhattan. That would be a disaster. It has to be somebody who has Jeff Sessions\u2019s ideological compass [and] experience inside the department and is willing to kick things around. I think that\u2019s the most important criteria.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very nervous about who Trump is going to pick,\u201d Adams said. \u201cHis instincts can be genius sometimes, and his instincts can be squarely off. \u2026 Where this pick goes is really going to dictate a lot about what sort of anti-Holder/Obama world we are going to live in at the Justice Department.\u201d\n\nAdams continued, \u201cIf I was the president, I\u2019d pick [Texas Congressman] Louie Gohmert. I\u2019d pick someone out of the Freedom Caucus on the Judiciary Committee to do it in a safe House seat. Maybe a Sen. Ted Cruz, that would be another one. Of course that won\u2019t happen, but you get my point, you need someone like that who basically knows the mischief of the last eight years under Holder and knows what needs to be done.\u201d\n\nAdams also highlighted the conflict of interest inherent in the appointment of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to oversee the Mueller investigation.\n\n\u201c[Rosenstein] was signing off on affidavits for FISA warrants, so he\u2019s a witness to things, but it\u2019s worse than that,\u201d said Adams. \u201cRosenstein is a guy who\u2019s never worked in the private sector as far as I know. He\u2019s a longtime lifelong bureaucrat. How he got appointed \u2014 I\u2019d love to see Breitbart do a story on that one \u2014 how he got appointed to be the deputy attorney general, because that\u2019s really the source of all these problems, is that transition decision to appoint Rod Rosenstein the number two.\u201d\n\nAdams stated, \u201cI think [leftists and Democrats] are afraid that Rod Rosenstein is the next to go. If he goes, then really all bets are off with Mueller. \u2026 They\u2019re going to give a directive. Matt Whitaker, who is acting attorney general, is going to say, \u2018You need to do your report now, or you\u2019re done.\u2019 I think that\u2019s where this is headed.\u201d\n\nPollak said, \u201cI think they need to say to Mueller, \u2018Let\u2019s see your reports. Make the case for your investigation continuing. I want you write me a memo making the case for this continuing. You don\u2019t have to reveal classified information, but essentially the public is going to see part of this case.\u2019 Make Mueller make the case. \u2026 I think making Mueller make the case to the acting Attorney General is the way to go.\u201d\n\nAdams recalled how former Attorney General Eric Holder sent hundreds of millions of dollars worth of fines levied against banks to fund left-wing activist groups.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s say [Sessions] has done a hundred things. Ninety-nine of them are exactly right, and it\u2019s this. \u2026 The slush funds. These were civil rights settlements that the Holder Justice Department was extracting from big banks. These were hundreds of millions of dollars in settlements, and the Holder Justice Department was forcing payments from these settlements to go to left-wing activists organizations. Literally filing their bank coffers with cash so then they could agitate with their Alinsky agitation. That\u2019s just one of the many things that Sessions stopped.\u201d\n\nAdams described the DOJ\u2019s civil rights division as the federal government\u2019s most powerful agency.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the most powerful agency in the entire federal government,\u201d said Adams. \u201cThere is no other agency that has control over the things that they do: school, police, voting, drive-in theaters, movie theaters, education, prisons, mental institution, disability, service dogs on airplanes; literally there\u2019s a laundry list of about 200 things in daily life; Kindle, whether or not something\u2019s in braille or has closed captions. \u2026 The radicals in the civil rights division \u2014 housing lending, car loans \u2014 use the civil rights division to fundamentally transform America. So what they did was bring in hundreds of radical lawyers, we\u2019ve got their resumes, and just filled the place with lunatics, and they\u2019re still there.\u201d\n\nBreitbart News Tonight broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot channel 125 weeknights from 9:00 p.m. to midnight Eastern or 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Pacific.\n\nFollow Robert Kraychik on Twitter.", "American college professors are having a hard time processing some of the results from Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections.\n\nGeorgetown University Professor Christine Fair, who tweeted in October that white male GOP senators deserved slow \u201cmiserable deaths,\u201d said that the midterm results revealed America\u2019s bigotries.\n\n\u201cResults showed our country is divided into racist, xenophobic, misogynist, and xenophobic bigots on the one hand and those who embrace diversity as the source of our strength, who aspire to extend equal rights to all irrespective of race, creed, gender, who you love on the other,\u201d Fair tweeted.\n\nResults showed our country is divided into racist, xenophobic, misogynist, and xphobic bigots on the one hand and those who embrace diversity as the source of our strength, who aspire to extend equal rights to all irrespective of race,creed, gender, who you love on the other. https://t.co/INeWXB5UmF \u2014 (((Christine Fair))) (@CChristineFair) November 7, 2018\n\nMark Copelovitch, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, tweeted out the \u201cSenate popular vote.\u201d The tally shows the total votes Senate candidates received for each party.

Bill Nelson\u2019s recount efforts in Florida.\n\nThe Florida Senate race is likely headed to a recount after late reporting from Broward County lowered Gov. Rick Scott\u2019s lead to about 17,000 votes, meaning the election is within the .25% margin necessary to require a hand recount. The race has already reached the 0.5 percent threshold to require a machine recount.\n\nIn a conference call with reporters, Elias claimed that optical-scan machines may not have registered ballots that were poorly marked, and he contended that Nelson would emerge victorious from a recount, which has not yet been officially authorized.\n\n\u201cWe believe that at the end of this process, Sen. Nelson is going to be declared the winner,\u201d Elias said.\n\nElias added: \u201cWe\u2019re doing this not just because it\u2019s automatic, but we\u2019re doing it to win. A significant number of ballots have not yet been counted and, because of the size of Florida, we believe the results of the election are unknown and require a recount.\u201d\n\nElias is widely considered one of the most powerful attorneys associated with the Democratic Party. He is chair of the Political Law Group at the Perkins Coie law firm. Elias represented Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign as well as the Democratic National Committee. He was brought in by Nelson\u2019s campaign to oversee official recount efforts.\n\nLast year, the Washington Post reported that in April 2016, Elias and his law firm Perkins Coie retained Fusion GPS to conduct the firm\u2019s anti-Trump work on behalf of both Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign and the DNC. The work resulted in the publication of the dossier authored by former British spy Christopher Steele.\n\nThrough Perkins Coie, Clinton\u2019s campaign and the DNC continued to fund Fusion GPS until October 2016, days before Election Day, the Post reported.\n\nWhile it is not clear how much the Clinton campaign or the DNC paid Fusion GPS, the UK Independent, citing campaign finance records, reported that the Clinton campaign doled out $5.6 million to Perkins Coie from June 2015 to December 2016.\n\nRecords show that since November 2015, the DNC paid the law firm $3.6 million in \u201clegal and compliance consulting.\u201d\n\nSteele reportedly met with the FBI on July 5, 2016 to report his purported findings about Trump and Russia. The Steele dossier was reportedly utilized by the FBI in part to conduct its probe into Trump over the unsubstantiated Russia collusion claims.\n\nAccording to House Intelligence Committee documents, the questionable dossier was also used by Obama administration officials to obtain a FISA warrant to conduct surveillance on Carter Page, who briefly served as a volunteer foreign policy adviser to Trump\u2019s campaign. The political origins of the dossier and issues relating to Steele\u2019s credibility as a source were kept from the FISA court, a House Republican memo documents.\n\nBesides its role in sending funds to Fusion GPS, Perkins Coie also reportedly helped draft the outside firm CrowdStrike to aid with the DNC\u2019s allegedly hacked servers.\n\nCrowdStrike is the third-party company ultimately relied upon by the FBI to make its assessment about alleged Russian hacking into the DNC. The DNC reportedly did not allow the FBI to gain access to servers that were suspected of being hacked, instead coming to an arrangement with the federal agency in which CrowdStrike carried out forensics on the servers and shared details with the FBI.\n\nIn Florida, meanwhile, Republican Ron DeSantis, the former Congressman who won the gubernatorial election, is now within the .5% threshold required for a machine recount.\n\nOpponent Andrew Gillum has not officially asked for a recount and that effort is considered a longshot, but Gillum\u2019s campaign on Thursday hinted at challenging the ballot counting.\n\n\u201cOn Tuesday night, the Gillum for Governor campaign operated with the best information available about the number of outstanding ballots left to count. Since that time, it has become clear there are many more uncounted ballots than was originally reported,\u201d stated Gillum\u2019s communications director, Johanna Cervone. \u201cMayor Gillum started his campaign for the people, and we are committed to ensuring every single vote in Florida is counted.\u201d\n\nAaron Klein is Breitbart\u2019s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

They contain the remains of thousands of victims, the majority of whom may never be identified. These large\u2010scale crime scenes are sites of harrowing human loss, profound suffering and shocking cruelty. \u2026 At the time of publication, based on information from Iraqi authorities, [the U.N.] had documented 202 mass graves sites, the largest numbers located in the governorates of Ninewa (95), Kirkuk (37) Salah al\u2010Din (36) and Anbar (24). Current estimates provided to [the U.N.] range from 6,000 to more than 12,000 victims buried in these sites. Victims include women, children, elderly and persons with disabilities, members and former members of the Iraqi armed forces and police, and some foreign workers. Iraqi Christians consider Ninewa (or Nineveh) \u2014 once home to the largest concentration of minority groups in the country \u2014to be their historical homeland. Mosul, the capital of Nineveh province, served as ISIS\u2019s primary stronghold in Iraq. \u201cWhile it is difficult to determine the total number of people in these graves, the smallest site, in west Mosul, contained eight bodies while the biggest is believed to be the Khasfa sinkhole south of Mosul which may contain thousands,\u201d the U.N. acknowledged. \u201cThe mass grave sites documented in our report are a testament to harrowing human loss, profound suffering and shocking cruelty,\u201d Special Representative for Iraq of the Secretary-General of the U.N. Jan Kubis proclaimed in a statement issued Tuesday. \u201cDetermining the circumstances surrounding the significant loss of life will be an important step in the mourning process for families and their journey to secure their rights to truth and justice.\u201d\n\nThe international body asserted that evidence gleaned from the mass graves will be crucial to ensuring investigations, prosecutions, and convictions of those responsible. U.N. investigators stressed that the sites may contain critical forensic material that could assist in the identification of victims and their return to the families.\n\nThe U.N. explained:\n\nThis report highlights the challenges faced by Iraqi authorities in conducting exhumations, investigations, and identifying human remains, as well as the challenges faced by relatives seeking to obtain information on the fate and whereabouts of their missing family members, and, if dead, their mortal remains. In addition, this report highlights international law and standards relating to Iraq\u2019s obligations to investigate and prosecute the mass killings that occurred in the context of this conflict and best practices relating to the protection and examination of mass grave sites, including forensic investigation of mass graves in support of criminal processes.\n\nMichelle Bachelet, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, noted in a statement that \u201chorrific crimes\u201d committed by ISIS have left a scar on the victims and their families, adding that \u201cthousands of women, men, and children still [remain] unaccounted for,\u201d\n\n\u201cTheir families have the right to know what happened to their loved ones. Truth, justice and reparations are critical to ensuring a full reckoning for the atrocities committed by ISIL,\u201d she added.\n\nISIS controlled large swathes of Iraq between June 2014 and December 2017, when U.S.-backed Iraqi troops declared victory over the terrorist group.\n\nThe U.S. and United Nations have officially accused ISIS of committing genocide against Christians, Yazidis, and other ethno-religious minorities in the Middle East.\n\nAlthough the Pentagon\u2019s office of the inspector general (OIG) recently determined that \u201cISIS has lost all territory it held in Iraq,\u201d it warned that the jihadis still pose a threat as an \u201cunderground\u201d insurgency.\n\n\u201cDespite the loss of almost all of its territory, the terrorist organization kept some of its bureaucratic structures in place and continued to raise funds,\u201d the OIG added.\n\nAccording to the Pentagon\u2019s watchdog agency, the U.S. government and U.N believe an \u201cISIS resurgence\u201d is possible \u201cwithout improvements to security, stability, and governance in Iraq and Syria.\u201d\n\n\u201cClearing terrorists from remote and largely ungoverned terrain is a slow and difficult process, and eliminating ISIS from rural Iraq and Syria could take years,\u201d the inspector general noted.", "Less than 10 percent of the migrants arriving at the United States-Mexico border from Central America have legitimate asylum claims, new Department of Homeland Security (DHS) data reveals.\n\nAs President Trump\u2019s administration releases new asylum rules \u2014 blocking illegal border crossers from claiming asylum in the U.S. \u2014 DHS data notes that the overwhelming majority of Central American migrants who claim \u201ccredible fear\u201d do not have legitimate asylum claims.\n\nThe issue of the country\u2019s loose asylum laws \u2014 where foreign nationals can claim that they fear for their lives in their native country and be released into the U.S. until their day in court \u2014 has sparked debate as a caravan of 7,000 to 10,000 Central Americans heads to the U.S.\n\nIn Fiscal Year 2018, nearly 90 percent of Central American migrants who arrived at the border and claimed \u201ccredible fear\u201d passed their initial asylum-seeking interview. Only nine percent of those migrants seeking asylum, though, are ultimately granted asylum.\n\nIn almost 50 percent of cases where Central American migrants passed their initial asylum-seeking screening, the migrant never appeared for their asylum hearing or did not even file an asylum application. These migrants likely find work in the U.S. and live as illegal aliens.\n\nThanks to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, asylum rules were reformed to prevent migrants from receiving asylum by claiming they are fleeing violence, gangs, or domestic abuse. These are not eligible asylum claims.\n\nEvery year the U.S. admits more than 1.5 million foreign nationals, with the vast majority deriving from family-based chain migration, whereby newly naturalized citizens can bring an unlimited number of foreign relatives to the U.S. In 2016, the legal and illegal immigrant population reached a record high of 44 million. By 2023, the Center for Immigration Studies estimates that the legal and illegal immigrant population of the U.S. will make up nearly 15 percent of the entire U.S. population.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

These horrors have included Ukrainians deliberately starved in the Holodomor, Russians purged in the Great Terror, Cambodians murdered in the killing fields, and Berliners shot as they tried to escape to freedom.

Because it is racist against Asian students.\n\nThe op-ed, which was written by student Katrina Leibee, claims that Zahra Al-Saloom, the director of Diversity and Inclusion at the university gave her a packet that included phrases that should not be uttered on campus.\n\nIn a meeting with Zahra Al-Saloom, the director of Diversity and Inclusion at Associated Students of Colorado State University, she showed me an entire packet of words and phrases that were deemed non-inclusive. One of these phrases was \u201clong time, no see,\u201d which is viewed as derogatory towards those of Asian descent.\n\nLeibee says that she asked Al-Saloom why she wants to police language on campus, especially considering that language is not policed in the real world.\n\nI asked both Al-Saloom and Rodgers the question: If this sort of language is not censored outside of this campus, why should we censor it here?

Nielsen, Acting Attorney General Matthew G. Whitaker. They continued:\n\nToday\u2019s rule applies this important principle to aliens who violate such a suspension or restriction regarding the southern border imposed by the President by invoking an express authority provided by Congress to restrict eligibility for asylum. Our asylum system is overwhelmed with too many meritless asylum claims from aliens who place a tremendous burden on our resources, preventing us from being able to expeditiously grant asylum to those who truly deserve it. Today, we are using the authority granted to us by Congress to bar aliens who violate a Presidential suspension of entry or other restriction from asylum eligibility.\u201d\n\nThe policy covers the migrants in the three caravans that are moving northwards, and all other migrants who cross the border illegally. Currently, most of the economic migrants who cross the border are allowed to file for asylum, which ensures their release into the U.S. job market for at least two years, pending a judge\u2019s approval or rejection of their asylum claims.\n\nThe plan has two steps.\n\nFirst, the president uses his legal authority to bar the entry of some groups of travelers into the United States. The likely group is migrants seeking jobs in the United States. This declaration provides border officials with additional legal authority for the second step.\n\nSecond, border officials will detain illegal migrants who cross the border between the official \u201cports of entry.\u201d The caught migrants would be denied the right to file for full asylum even they claimed a \u201ccredible fear\u201d of being sent home. These illegal migrants would be allowed a \u201cwithholding of removal\u201d status which allows them to stay in the United States but does not put them on a track to green cards and citizenship. But officials would also be allowed to deport the illegal migrants under the fast-track \u201cexpedited removal\u201d laws, so ensuring they are not released into the U.S. job market.\n\nEconomic migrants who use the ports of entry would still be allowed to file for full asylum, with the possibility of catch-and-release if they pass their credible-fear tests.\n\nMany migrants apply for asylum, in part, because the application allows them to legally get U.S. jobs until a court denies their asylum request, usually after a delay of two years. According to an agency statement:\n\nAs of November 2, 2018, there were approximately 203,569 total [asylum] cases pending in the immigration courts that originated with a credible-fear referral\u2014or 26% of the total backlog of 791,821 removal cases. Of that number, 136,554 involved nationals of Northern Triangle countries.\n\nSenior administration officials said the plan does not deal with economic migrants who bring children to trigger the Flores catch-and-release loophole.\n\n\u201cWe do not expect any one action to stall all of the myriad legions of flaws in our nation\u2019s current immigration system,\u201d an official told reporters. \u201cWe are looking at a number of possibilities and a number of [additional] legal options,\u201d the official said.\n\nBut officials have drafted a regulation that would replace the Flores catch-and-release rule. The regulation would allow officials to keep migrants with children in tent cities, so ending the catch-and-release policies if Congress fully funds the tent cities. If catch-and-release is ended, the grants lose their ability to get jobs in the United States which they need to repay their smuggling debts.\n\nHowever, Democrats and business-first Republicans have been loath to build legal or physical barriers to the movement of migrants into U.S. jobs, apartments and supermarkets.\n\nThe new policy is likely to be blocked by pro-migration judges. In turn, officials likely will ask for the Supreme Court to let the policy continue while courts argue over its legality.\n\nThe new 78-page regulation describes the policy:\n\nSUMMARY: The Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDOJ,\u201d \u201cDHS,\u201d or, collectively, \u201cthe Departments\u201d) are adopting an interim final rule governing asylum claims in the context of aliens who are subject to, but contravene, a suspension or limitation on entry into the United States through the southern border with Mexico that is imposed by a presidential proclamation or other presidential order (\u201ca proclamation\u201d) under section 212(f) or 215(a)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d). Pursuant to statutory authority, the Departments are amending their respective existing regulations to provide that aliens subject to such a proclamation concerning the southern border, but who contravene such a proclamation by entering the United States \u2026 The interim rule, if applied to a proclamation suspending the entry of aliens who cross the southern border unlawfully, would bar such aliens from eligibility for asylum and thereby channel inadmissible aliens to ports of entry, where they would be processed in a controlled, orderly, and lawful manner. This rule would apply only prospectively to a proclamation issued after the effective date of this rule. It would not apply to a proclamation that specifically includes an exception for aliens applying for asylum, nor would it apply to aliens subject to a waiver or exception provided by the proclamation. \u2026 The regulations would ensure that aliens in this category who establish a reasonable fear of persecution or torture could seek withholding of removal under the INA or protection from removal under regulations implementing U.S. obligations under Article 3 of the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (\u201cCAT\u201d).\n\nThe law allows the President to block the entry of people into the United States. An agency statement cited the relevant laws:\n\nSection 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act states plainly: \u201cWhenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.\u201d Section 215(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act similarly states: \u201cUnless otherwise ordered by the President, it shall be unlawful for any alien to depart from or enter or attempt to depart from or enter the United States except under such reasonable rules, regulations, and orders, and subject to such limitations and exceptions as the President may prescribe.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cinterim final rule\u201d regulation is available here.", "A convicted Texas Democrat won his race for re-election on Tuesday to state House District 27 from behind bars.\n\nKXAN reported that the victory celebration for inmate number 232573, who is better known as state Representative Ron Reynolds (D-Missouri City), took place in Pod 2 of the Montgomery County Jail after the incarcerated Democrat was declared the winner of the Houston-area suburb.\n\nReynolds ran unopposed in his race and was backed by Robert Francis \u201cBeto\u201d O\u2019Rourke, the Texas Democratic U.S. Representative who sought to unseat Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX).\n\nOn September 7, 2018, Reynolds (D-Missouri City) was booked into the county jail.

Ultimately, the court rejected him.\n\nThen, in 2016, as a consequence of his conviction, Reynolds was disbarred from practicing law.

The president has no power to circumvent that.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cI think when the Democrats take over the House they should simply disregard everything that this pretender to the position of attorney general tries to do. He\u2019s not Senate confirmed. That makes his appointment unconstitutional. It shouldn\u2019t get lost in technical details.\u201d\n\nHe explained, \u201cWhat I mean is, the way they do it is pick up the phone and ask Robert Mueller to come over to the Hill and testify under oath to all of his findings except for the things that are classified.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cIf the president uses one of his powers corruptly to cover up his own criminality or serious wrongdoing and that\u2019s what\u2019s going on, the president\u2019s displeasure with Jeff Sessions, then that\u2019s an abuse of power and that enters impeachment territory. It seems to me from the beginning when he basically said, \u2018I don\u2019t think Jeff Sessions should recuses himself,\u2019 even though the rules of the Department of Justice told him he should because he was involved in the campaign he would otherwise be supervising the investigation of, \u2018I don\u2019t think he should recuse himself\u2019 and he made it transparent to anyone with eyes or ears, the reason is he wanted someone in that position who would shield him, protect him from the investigation. In other words, obstruct the investigation. The installation of Whittaker is unconstitutional as well as a violation of the Federal Vacancy Reform Act. And the removal of Sessions, which was only covered with a thin fig leaf of resignation, it was a firing, the removal was itself part of a pattern of obstruction of justice.

When we follow \u2018right to be forgotten\u2019 laws, we are censoring search results because we\u2019re complying with the law.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m committed to serving users in China. Whatever form it takes, I actually don\u2019t know the answer,\u201d he proclaimed. \u201cIt\u2019s not even clear to me that search in China is the product we need to do today.\u201d\n\nGoogle, under Pichai, is currently working on a censored search engine for the Chinese government, code-named Project Dragonfly, which will stop dissidents from searching for terms related to human rights, democracy, and protest, and will link searches to the searcher\u2019s phone number \u2014 eroding anonymity.\n\nSeveral employees have resigned from Google over the project, which executives told employees to \u201ckeep quiet\u201d about, for fear of being complicit with the \u201cerosion of protection for dissidents.\u201d\n\nOn the topic of the mass Google employee walkout protest against sexual harassment at the company last week, Pichai noted, \u201cPeople are walking out because they want us to improve and they want us to show we can do better.

But here is the thing\u2026\n\nThe Daily Beast had no idea when he visited, which is something these so-called reporters are forced to admit in their stealth rewrite of the original article.\n\nOriginal story: \u201cThe leader of a white nationalist group whose members marched in the 2017 white supremacist rally in Charlottesville visited the White House on Wednesday, according to pictures he posted online.\u201d\n\nStealth rewrite: \u201cThough [the white nationalist\u2019s] post was dated Wednesday, Walters\u2019 explanation suggests that he visited the White House on either October 20 or 21, when the Fall Garden Tour was held.\u201d\n\nSo based only on the date the photo was posted, without knowing if it were true, the Daily Beast told its readers that date was also the date of the visit, which, of course, fit a false narrative about triumphant racists celebrating Tuesday\u2019s election results as guests of the White House.\n\nWorse still\u2026\n\nRather than do the correct thing\u2013rather than issue a correction or retract the fake news\u2013the article was stealthily edited with a massive rewrite. (You can compare the before and after here and here.)\n\nAt the bottom of the rewrite, an editor\u2019s note reads, \u201cThis article has been updated with additional reporting,\u201d which is not even close to true. The truth is that all of the fake news was secretly retracted and the article rewritten almost entirely.\n\nIt is also worth noting that the \u201cwhite nationalist\u201d in question, Patrick Casey, does not claim to be a white nationalist but an identitarian activist, a group the far-left media regularly attack as racist.\n\nFinally, Will Sommer, the co-writer of this fake news deception and the subsequent cover-up, makes a living smearing right-leaning journalists as racists and liars, all in the hope of having them de-platformed, censored, and silenced.

Political reliability and a passion for warfare are also essential:\n\n\u201cThese kids are all exceptionally bright, but being bright is not enough,\u201d said a BIT professor who was involved in the screening process but asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the subject. \u201cWe are looking for other qualities such as creative thinking, willingness to fight, a persistence when facing challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cA passion for developing new weapons is a must \u2026 and they must also be patriots.\u201d Each student will be mentored by two senior weapons scientists, one from an academic background and the other from the defense industry, according to the program\u2019s brochure. After completing a short program of course work in the first semester, the students will be asked to choose a speciality field, such as mechanical engineering, electronics or overall weapon design. They will then be assigned to a relevant defense laboratory where they will be able to develop their skills through hands-on experience.\n\nBIT said it has recruited 27 boys and four girls so far, a gender mix that social justice warriors would consider highly problematic if the Chinese Communists had to worry about such things. One of the male recruits rhapsodized about his lifelong fascination with guns on the BIT website and said he \u201ccouldn\u2019t resist the attraction\u201d of the A.I. weapons program.\n\nThe A.I. warfare curriculum is expected to last four years and lead into a full Ph.D. program, creating a new generation of combat cyber experts. Observers outside China found the prospect of recruiting such young people into A.I. warfare programs disturbing:\n\nEleonore Pauwels, a fellow in emerging cybertechnologies at the Centre for Policy Research, United Nations University in New York, said she was concerned about the launch of the BIT course. \u201cThis is the first university programme in the world designed to aggressively and strategically encourage the next generation to think, design and deploy AI for military research and use.\u201d While the US had similar programmes, such as those run by the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency, they operated in relative secrecy and employed only the cream of established scientists, Pauwels said.\n\nPauwels imagined the young recruits combining A.I. technology with cutting-edge research in other fields to produce such horrors as nanobot swarms seeding enemy food supplies with chemical and biological weapons, or killer robots that can \u201ctarget, with surgical precision, specific populations\u201d using facial recognition technology. The Chinese have lately developed a keen interest in targeting specific populations in troublesome regions.\n\n\u201cThe fact that China\u2019s AI national strategy is built on a doctrine of civil-military fusion means that an AI prototype for military use could be co-opted and perverted for surveillance or harm in the civilian context,\u201d as Pauwels put it.\n\nThe Chinese are enthusiastically fusing commercial electronics, espionage, and military programs together, while the free world has a tough time getting Big Tech to work on defense projects at all.\n\nThere are three particularly disturbing aspects of the coming generation of A.I. weapons: they can execute strategies that would require prohibitive amounts of time and manpower if delegated to humans, they will perform those tasks without hesitation or remorse, and they can execute them so quickly that human commanders will not have a chance to rescind orders with unexpectedly horrific consequences. The world can only hope extensive ethics courses are part of every cyber-warfare training curriculum.", "Russia and South Korea both announced plans this week to continue doing business with Iran despite the heavier round of U.S. sanctions that went into effect on November 5.\n\nRussia managed to find a way to toss Iran a lifeline while simultaneously profiting from Tehran\u2019s misery. Meanwhile, South Korea made arrangements to continue trading with Iran using South Korea\u2019s currency.\n\nRussia, which unlike South Korea did not receive a temporary waiver from the sanctions, said it would defy American demands and continue buying at least 100,000 barrels of oil per day from Iran, which is a key Russian ally in the Middle East.\n\nHowever, the Russians stipulated they would pay for the Iranian oil with Russian food and equipment, plus increased Russian investment in Iran\u2019s sanctions-suppressed oil industry. At the same time, Russia is ramping up its own oil output and seizing market share from Tehran.\n\nThe Europeans, who grumbled about U.S. sanctions but largely complied with them, are particularly interested in shifting to Russian supplies because, for various technical reasons, Russian products are the most convenient replacement for Iranian crude. Turkish and Chinese importers are also finding a switch to Russian oil is easier and safer than defying U.S. sanctions, as their governments originally vowed to do.\n\nThe results, as reported by the Wall Street Journal on Thursday, are very bad news for Iran but delightful for the Russian oil industry:\n\nOn Tuesday, Rosneft reported a three-fold jump in net income to 451 billion rubles ($6.8 billion) for the first nine months of 2018 compared with the same period last year, mostly due to a production boost and higher prices for Urals. The same replacement effect came about in China, which cut oil imports from Iran by 34% in September year-on year, while Russian sales rose by 7%. In South Korea, Tehran\u2019s oil sales collapsed in August, falling 85% on an annual basis. Russian shipments rose by 20% the same month, according to South Korean customs.\n\nSouth Korea did receive a six-month waiver from U.S. sanctions, with the expectation it would begin dramatically reducing Iranian oil imports. Iran\u2019s state-run PressTV portrayed an agreement reached by South Korean officials visiting Tehran over the weekend as Seoul signing on to a plan that will undermine U.S. sanctions, but the original Yonhap News report made it clear the South Korean delegation was merely explaining how the sanctions will work:\n\nA team of South Korean officials visited Tehran on the weekend, just before the U.S. announcement of waivers on its Iranian oil embargo, and offered a detailed briefing on Seoul\u2019s related agreement with Washington, a diplomatic source here said Tuesday. The move reflects South Korea\u2019s resolve to maintain relatively good relations with Iran despite the revival of U.S. sanctions on the Middle Eastern country\u2019s energy and financial sectors. The delegation, led by Deputy Foreign Minister for Economic Affairs Yun Kang-hyeon, met with Iranian officials on Saturday and explained the content and background of the waiver deal in detail, according to the source.\n\nAs Yonhap explained, Seoul wishes to \u201ccooperate with Washington on its efforts to tighten the screws on Tehran for its nuclear program,\u201d while also taking advantage of the sanctions waiver granted by the United States and maintaining commerce that is not forbidden by the sanctions. To that end, South Korea\u2019s won currency will be employed to facilitate transactions through the Iranian central bank\u2019s accounts in South Korea.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s expected to provide South Korean firms with more opportunities for the trade of non-sanctions items such as medical products, processed food, and home appliances, although the exports of some products including steel and automobile parts will be affected by the sanctions,\u201d a diplomatic source in Seoul explained.\n\nThe South Korean delegation was also eager to ensure Iran would be able to pay some $200 million in outstanding debts to South Korean exporters. The Iranians reportedly responded \u201cpositively\u201d to these requests.", "Attorney George Conway, the husband of White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, declared in a New York Times op-ed published Thursday that President Donald Trump\u2019s appointment of Matthew Whitaker as acting Attorney General is \u201cunconstitutional\u201d and \u201cillegal.\u201d\n\nThe premise by which Conway and co-author Neal Katyal\u2019s argue against Whitaker\u2019s appointment is based on the Constitution\u2019s Appointments Clause \u2014 the provision to which principal officers of the United States must not only be nominated by the president but also confirmed by the Senate using the body\u2019s \u201cAdvice and Consent\u201d powers. This argument, Coway and Katyal write, was the basis of a Wall Street Journal article penned by conservative scholar Steven Calabresi, in which it was argued that the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller to oversee the Russia investigation was unconstitutional because he was nominated by the president.\n\nDeputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed the former FBI director to lead the investigation in May 2017. One day after the midterm election, then-attorney general Jeff Sessions submitted his resignation at the behest of President Donald Trump, according to a leaked copy of the now former top Justice Department official.\n\nWhile Conway and Katyal disagreed with Calabresi conclusion, they concur with his assessment that the \u201ccore principle\u201d of the clause is not only correct but actually serves as a legal justification for preventing Whitaker from taking the temporary role of the country\u2019s chief lawyer. Thus, Conway and his co-author contend, Whitaker\u2019s installment is \u201cunconstitutional\u201d and illegal,\u201d adding that \u201cit means that anything Mr. Whitaker does, or tries to do, in that position is invalid.\u201d\n\nMuch of the commentary about Mr. Whitaker\u2019s appointment has focused on all sorts of technical points about the Vacancies Reform Act and Justice Department succession statutes. But the flaw in the appointment of Mr. Whitaker, who was Mr. Sessions\u2019s chief of staff at the Justice Department, runs much deeper. It defies one of the explicit checks and balances set out in the Constitution, a provision designed to protect us all against the centralization of government power. If you don\u2019t believe us, then take it from Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, whom President Trump once called his \u201cfavorite\u201d sitting justice. Last year, the Supreme Court examined the question of whether the general counsel of the National Labor Relations Board had been lawfully appointed to his job without Senate confirmation. The Supreme Court held the appointment invalid on a statutory ground. Justice Thomas agreed with the judgment, but wrote separately to emphasize that even if the statute had allowed the appointment, the Constitution\u2019s Appointments Clause would not have. The officer in question was a principal officer, he concluded. And the public interest protected by the Appointments Clause was a critical one: The Constitution\u2019s drafters, Justice Thomas argued, \u201crecognized the serious risk for abuse and corruption posed by permitting one person to fill every office in the government.\u201d Which is why, he pointed out, the framers provided for advice and consent of the Senate.\n\nFurther, the pair argues that Whitaker\u2019s lack of qualifications puts the Justice Department and its cases at risk. \u201cConstitutionally, Matthew Whitaker is a nobody,\u201d write Conway and Katyal. \u201cFor the president to install Mr. Whitaker as our chief law enforcement officer is to betray the entire structure of our charter document.\u201d\n\nWhitaker\u2019s appointment does not require Senate confirmation because he previously served as Sessions\u2019 chief of staff. The lack of scrutiny, as the pair write, leaves the public with an acting Attorney General whom may have serious legal and philosophical differences with the spirit of the agency. \u201cThe public is entitled to that assurance, especially since Mr. Whitaker\u2019s only supervisor is President Trump himself, and the president is hopelessly compromised by the Mueller investigation. That is why adherence to the requirements of the Appointments Clause is so important here, and always,\u201d the two write.", "Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie was spotted at the White House on Thursday, prompting rumors that he is in consideration for attorney general.\n\nSeveral news reports cited \u201csources familiar\u201d with the visit or \u201csources close to\u201d the White House who say that Christie is under consideration for the position.\n\nAn administration source, however, told CNN that Christie was attending a previously scheduled roundtable meeting on prison reform.\n\nChristie shocked the Republican establishment after he endorsed then-candidate Donald Trump for president in February 2016 and joined Trump\u2019s campaign.\n\nAfter the election, the governor declined to accept a position in President Trump\u2019s administration, citing his preference to remain in New Jersey until his term as governor was complete. Another speculation was that Christie was only interested in the attorney general position, which Trump gave to Jeff Sessions as a reward for his loyalty.\n\nBut others believed that Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, held a grudge against Christie for prosecuting his father, Charlie Kushner, and forced him out.\n\nThe CNN story also cites an administration source who says that Kushner and Christie are on good terms and agree on prison reform efforts.", "Britain\u2019s pre-eminent conservative philosopher, Sir Roger Scruton, has come out fighting in response to a left-wing campaign to drive him from public life.\n\nThe celebrated writer, who has been decorated in multiple ex-Communist countries where he helped to support the underground universities during the Cold War \u2014 with the Soviet puppet regime in Czechoslovakia arresting and expelling him and before placing him on their \u2018Index of Undesirable Persons\u2019 for his troubles \u2014 has fallen victim to an online outrage mob.\n\nThe attacks started after the government announced Scruton\u2019s appointment to the \u2018Building Better, Building Beautiful\u2019 commission, which will look at improving new building developments in Britain\u2019s towns and cities, which have been terribly degraded by socialistic central planners and modern architects since the end of the Second World War.\n\nLeft-wing commentators have dredged up a number of comments the philosopher has made concerning George Soros, gay adoption, and the emergence of \u2018Islamophobia\u2019 in the political discourse over a long academic career in order to smear him as harbouring various species of bigotry, with little support from the nominally \u2018conservative\u2019 political class and media establishment \u2014 but, so far, he is standing firm.\n\nObviously, Britain should not have a million new homes built upon it \u2014 but if this is to be forced upon us from above, Sir Roger Scruton is by far the best person to oversee it: https://t.co/O0T48tn6Q5 \u2014 Oliver JJ Lane (@oliver_lane) November 7, 2018\n\n\u201cFollowing my appointment as unpaid chair of the commission on Building More, Building Beautiful, there has been a rash of out-of-context quotations designed to suggest that I am anti-Semitic, and also tarred with the brush of \u201cIslamophobia\u201d. It even counts against my appointment that I once defended the Catholic Church\u2019s attitude to gay adoption. So let me confess,\u201d he began in a column for The Telegraph.\n\nDirectly addressing the most serious charge of anti-Semitism, based on the statement \u201cMany of the Budapest intelligentsia are Jewish, and form part of the extensive networks around the Soros Empire,\u201d he provided the full context of the quote, which came from a speech in which he highlighted the very real problems of anti-Sentimism, and why it might help to explain a distrust of \u201cnationalism\u201d among many Jewish intellectuals:\n\nThe remnant of territory that [Hungarians] still enjoy is shared with a substantial minority of Roma, whose unsettled ways are often resented by their neighbours, but whose cause inevitably gathers support in the wider world. The Jewish minority that survived the Nazi occupation suffered further persecution under the Communists, but nevertheless is active in making its presence known. Many of the Budapest intelligentsia are Jewish, and form part of the extensive networks around the Soros Empire. People in these networks include many who are rightly suspicious of nationalism, regard nationalism as the major cause of the tragedy of Central Europe in the 20th century, and do not distinguish nationalism from the kind of national loyalty that I have defended in this talk. Moreover, as the world knows, indigenous anti-Semitism still plays a part in Hungarian society and politics, and presents an obstacle to the emergence of a shared national loyalty among ethnic Hungarians and Jews. Those are only some of the factors that stand in the way of a collective pre-political attachment in this part of the world\u2026\n\nTurning to the subject of \u2018Islamophobia\u2019, which he was condemned for describing as a \u201cpropaganda word\u201d, he held his ground steadfastly.\n\n\u201cI deplore the invention of this word, and all that it has meant by way of silencing one side to a much-needed debate. It belongs to the new politics, based in \u2018the art of taking offence\u2019, among people who could not care less whether real offence has been given,\u201d he confirmed.\n\n\u201cThose who wish to know my views on Islam might like to read what I write in The West and the Rest on the Muslim way of life. How this is relevant to my views on building beautiful is of course another question, though it should be said that I have learned a lot about the topic from my close association with Marwa al-Sabouni,\u201d he said, praising the noted female scholar on Islamic architecture.\n\nAppointing Sir @Roger_Scruton to the 'Building Better, Building Beautiful' commission was a genuinely inspired move by @theresa_may and @JBrokenshire.

When he was denied entry, the police report says del Prado pulled what looked like a firearm from his waistband, placed it to Kurt Tibbets\u2019 head, and reportedly said, \u201cI will ruin your life.\u201d\n\nThe report says that del Prado renewed his threats several days later when he saw Daniel Hoffman in a school weight room.\n\nBoth Tibbets and Hoffman expressed fear that del Prado was capable of shooting them.\n\nA police investigation revealed that the \u201cgun\u201d used to threaten the two players was a pellet gun, not a real firearm.\n\nDel Prado told police that he did not place the pellet gun to Tibbets\u2019 head but also admitted he was already drunk when he arrived at the party. He insisted he does not have a clear memory of the incident.\n\nFor its part, the school quickly moved to expel the suspect.\n\n\u201cThere is a student code of conduct that all students sign to be part of the university,\u201d said Ave Maria University marketing and communications director Mark McCormick. \u201cIt regulates behavior and activities, and he (del Prado) violated expected student behavior.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe hold our students, faculty, and staff to a pretty high standard,\u201d McCormick added. \u201cAll of us sign a code-of-expected-behavior document when we come on board.

Other allegations involve injured workers \u2014 including one with a severed finger \u2014 allegedly sent to the hospital via ridesharing service Lyft.\n\nReveal News reports that at Tesla, workers are expressly forbidden to call 911 in the event of a factory injury without company permission. Instead, company doctors inspect the worker\u2019s injuries and in many cases allegedly have the worker sent to a local hospital via Lyft ridesharing. This is the experience that one employee reportedly faced when their finger was severed while working at the company.\n\nInjured employees have reportedly often been sent back to work with no modifications whatsoever following visits to the on-site medical center. According to former clinic employees and medical records, some of these employees could barely walk when they were ordered to return to the assembly line. Reveal News writes:\n\nThe on-site medical clinic serving some 10,000 employees at Tesla Inc.\u2019s California assembly plant has failed to properly care for seriously hurt workers, an investigation by Reveal from The Center for Investigative Reporting has found. The clinic\u2019s practices are unsafe and unethical, five former clinic employees said.\n\nAnna Watson, a physician assistant who worked at Tesla\u2019s clinic for three weeks in August, commented on the facility stating: \u201cThe goal of the clinic was to keep as many patients off of the books as possible.\u201d Watson, who has been working as a medical professional for nearly twenty years, said that she had never seen anything like what was happening at the electric-car manufacturer.\n\nWatson, who was fired from the company after raising her concerns, stated: \u201cThe way they were implementing it was very out of control. Every company that I\u2019ve worked at is motivated to keep things not recordable. But I\u2019ve never seen anybody do it at the expense of treating the patient.\u201d\n\nReveal News described some of the symptoms that employees often complained of:\n\nWorkers with chest pain, breathing problems or extreme headaches have been dismissed as having issues unrelated to their work, without being fully evaluated or having workplace exposures considered, former employees said. The clinic has turned away temp workers who got hurt on Tesla\u2019s assembly lines, leaving them without on-site care. And medical assistants, who are supposed to have on-site supervision, say they were left on their own at night, unprepared to deal with a stream of night-shift injuries. If a work injury requires certain medical equipment \u2013 such as stitches or hard braces \u2013 then it has to be counted in legally mandated logs. But some employees who needed stitches for a cut instead were given butterfly bandages, said Watson and another former clinic employee. At one point, hard braces were removed from the clinic so they wouldn\u2019t be used, according to Watson and a former medical assistant.\n\nTesla hired Access Omnicare to run the company\u2019s medical facility in June. Records show that this was after the firm allegedly promised Tesla that they could bring down the number of recordable injuries and emergency room visits. A former high-level Access Omnicare employee claims that Tesla pressured the owner of Access Omnicare who in turn instructed his staff to dismiss minor employee injuries.\n\n\u201cIt was bullying and pressuring to do things people didn\u2019t believe were correct,\u201d said the former employee. The owner of Access Omnicare, Dr. Basil Besh, a qualified hand surgeon, claimed that the firm lowers injury rates by more accurately diagnosing health issues. \u201cWe treat the Tesla employees just the same way we treat our professional athletes,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Steph Curry twists his knee on a Thursday night game, that guy\u2019s in the MRI scanner on Friday morning.\u201d\n\nOne employee, Stephon Nelson, was working overnight on the company\u2019s production line, putting caulk inside the trunk of a Model X vehicle. It was then that the car slipped, injuring Nelson\u2019s back leaving deep red bruises down it. \u201cI couldn\u2019t walk, I couldn\u2019t sit down. I couldn\u2019t even stand up straight,\u201d said Nelson. He requested an ambulance directly after the incident took place, but a Tesla doctor told him that no ambulance was coming, and that he could instead take a Lyft to the local hospital.\n\n\u201cI just felt heartbroken,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cWhat they were telling us in the orientation, that Tesla is a company that cares about their employees\u2019 safety, it just seemed like it was just a whole reversal.\u201d This attitude from Tesla was corroborated by Watson who stated: \u201cThere was a strong push not to send anybody in an ambulance.\u201d\n\nDespite his injuries, Nelson was forced to return to work the next day where it became apparent he could not complete his job as a result of the incident. Workers that are injured are required to be given job restrictions and assignments that will not aggravate their injury, but no accommodations were made for Nelson. He was instructed that he could go home early that day but must return to work the following day ready to complete his job.\n\nReveal News states:\n\nBy law, work-related injuries must be recorded on injury logs if they require medical treatment beyond first aid, days away from work or job restrictions. The clinic\u2019s practices were designed to avoid those triggers, said Anna Watson, the physician assistant. There was a clinic rule, for example, that injured employees could not be given work restrictions, Watson said. No matter what type of injuries workers came in with \u2013 burns, lacerations, strains and sprains \u2013 clinic staff were under instructions to send them back to work full duty, she said.

Many of those present were young people, on hand for \u201ccollege night.\u201d\n\nCaptain Garo Kuredjian, Media Relations Officer for the Ventura County Police Department, told Breitbart News on the scene that there had been three officers from the Oxnard Police Department and three from the Los Angeles Police Department inside the Borderline, all off duty.\n\nThey were likely unarmed, he said, though he could not yet confirm that information, nor could he yet say if and how they had assisted victims or confronted the gunman.\n\n\u201cTypically, if you go to a bar, if you\u2019re going to be drinking,\u201d you would leave your gun at home, Kuredjian said.\n\nVentura County Sheriff Ron Helus, who arrived on the scene to stop the gunman, was shot and killed. He reportedly diverted the gunman\u2019s attention, saving the lives of others.\n\nThe full list of victims has not been released. The gunman was found dead at the scene when officers arrived.\n\nThe presence of police officers among the crowd recalls the Las Vegas shooting in October 2017, when many first responders were enjoying the Route 91 Harvest country music festival when a gunman began firing from a nearby hotel.\n\nMany of the people inside the Borderline had also been at the Route 91 Harvest event last year, according to a local resident, Gaby, whose friend is a bartender at the Borderline.\n\nGaby (who declined to provide her last name), who brought flowers to lay at the scene, said her friend had called in sick last night.\n\n\u201cYou hear about all these things happening but you never expect it to happen here,\u201d she said.\n\nLocal and international media camped out across the street from the Borderline as details continued to emerge. The surrounding streets were solemn in the autumn sunshine as neighbors tried to go about their normal routines.

The young man was enjoying a film when a bullet fired in an adjacent theater ripped through the wall.

I called 911 and ran.\u201d\n\nGolditch noted that despite his wound he was able to move, so he just took off. \u201cThe thought of losing my life, not being able to function properly, not being able to see, breathe, smell and move was not of my concern because my flight response kicked in,\u201d he said.\n\nThe player was lucky. The bullet entered under his left ear and tore completely through his neck, exiting out the right side. But luck held, and the slug passed millimeters away from his carotid artery, which if nicked would have seen him bleed out quickly.\n\n\u201cObviously, there\u2019s a lot of fragile stuff happening around your neck,\u201d Golditch added. \u201cI don\u2019t know the anatomy of the neck, but I was told I was pretty lucky.\u201d\n\nGolditch also said that the attack that killed 12 and wounded 70 helped define himself. \u201cIt not only showed a new side to myself, but it showed how strong Aurora is. It showed how supportive people really are. It brought out the best in people.\u201d\n\nAfter recovering from his wound, the newest Cardinal lineman went on to earn a scholarship at Colorado State where he played as a starting offensive lineman in 38 starts and 43 games.

A first step would require Iran to stop supplying missiles to the insurgent Houthis:\n\n[T]alk about demilitarizing the border so that the Saudis and the [United Arab] Emirates do not have to worry about missiles coming into their homes and cities and airports. [A cease-fire arrangement should] ensure that all the missiles that Iran has provided to the Houthis are put under international watch in parks somewhere, where they can be kept accounted for.\n\nIran would never agree to that condition, or if it agreed, it would not honor the commitment. Iran already claims that it does not supply missiles to the Houthis, so Iran could agree to this condition and then just keep doing what it is doing.\n\nNext, Mattis said: \u201c[Such a truce would help] set the conditions for [Yemeni factions to] return to traditional areas inside Yemen, and a government that allows for this amount of local autonomy that the Houthis or that southerners want.\u201d\n\nThe traditional area for the Houthis is northwest Yemen, far outside the capital city Sanaa.\n\nThe longer-term solution, and by longer-term, I mean 30 days from now, we want to see everybody sitting around the table, based on a cease-fire, based on a pullback from the border, and then based on ceasing dropping of bombs, that will permit the [U.N.] special envoy\u2014Martin Griffiths, who\u2019s very good, he knows what he\u2019s doing\u2014to get them together in Sweden and end this war. It\u2019s time to stop [the Yemen war]. And right now, what the Iranians have done by bringing in anti-ship missiles \u2026 it\u2019s interrupted freedom of navigation, they are the ones who keep fueling this conflict and they need to knock it off.\n\nThis is all fantasy. None of this is going to happen. But what is interesting is that pretty much the opposite has happened.\n\nFearing that U.S. support for the war might end in 30 days, Saudi Arabia has redoubled its attacks on Yemen\u2019s al-Hodeidah seaport. Two hundred air strikes were reported in and around Hodeidah on Saturday alone. Artillery shells had also hit residential areas and temporary roadblocks had prevented people from leaving or entering the city overnight, in effect trapping them in an active conflict zone, it added.\n\nThe U.N. says Yemen is on the brink of the world\u2019s worst famine in 100 years. The assault on the al-Hodeidah seaport has blocked humanitarian aid, including food and medicines, from reaching much of Yemen, with the danger of a worsening humanitarian crisis. U.S. Institute for Peace and Arab News and BBC and CNN\n\nThe Jamal Khashoggi murder changes the direction of the Yemen war\n\nWith so many people being killed in so many ways every day, it is somewhat startling to see that one particular murder, that of Washington Post columnist and Saudi national Jamal Khashoggi by other Saudi nationals in Istanbul on October 2, has been the cause of so much international chaos.\n\nThere are three reasons for this, in my opinion. First, the murder was particularly gruesome, ordered by the highest officials in the Saudi government, and the body has not yet been produced. Second, Turkey\u2019s president Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been dribbling out the facts of the case, so that every day there is a new revelation to embarrass the Saudi government. And third, the al-Jazeera news network, based in and funded by the government of Qatar, which has become Saudi Arabia\u2019s mortal enemy, is doing everything possible to keep the story alive, with lengthy coverage of the latest in every newscast.\n\nThe Khashoggi murder has also had geopolitical consequences. As I recently reported, Pakistan\u2019s new Prime Minister Imran Khan was able to use the Khashoggi scandal as leverage to convince Saudi Arabia to provide $6 billion in aid.\n\nIt now appears that the Khashoggi murder is also changing the direction of the Yemen war. The murder has strengthened the hand of activists in the U.K. and Washington who want Saudi Arabia to end the Yemen war. The statement by Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, excerpted above, was an outcome of the Khashoggi murder.\n\nThe Yemen war has been a disaster for Saudi Arabia. Despite repeated promises that the war would end quickly, the Saudis are completely bogged down in a seemingly never-ending war. They would love for Mattis\u2019 recommendations to succeed, but in the end, that would hand Yemen over to the Iranians, and they cannot agree to that.\n\nHowever, we are already seeing unintended consequences, specifically Saudi Arabia doubling down on the violent assault on Hodeidah. The proposal by Mattis was a ceasefire by all parties, including Iran, the Houthis, Saudi Arabia, and United Arab Emirates (UAE), and then have a peace conference in Geneva. That was never going to happen and, if it did, it would have resulted in a \u201cpeace process\u201d with no commitments honored by the parties. History shows that this kind of peace process will not work.\n\nKhashoggi\u2019s murder has led to Mattis\u2019 statement, which has led to a massive increase in the violence in the Hodeidah attack. The Saudis want to bring the Houthis to their knees and force a negotiated truce under terms favorable to the Saudis. History shows that this kind of attack will not work, either. This kind of attack only works when it is at the climax of a generational crisis war, and then only when all the parties are so war-weary and exhausted that they will agree to end the war. The Yemen war is nowhere near a climax.

One investigation found that an NGO\u2019s employees knowingly diverted thousands of USAID- funded food kits worth millions of dollars to ineligible beneficiaries (including HTS fighters) and submitted falsified beneficiary lists. The investigation resulted in USAID suspending the program and the NGO terminating the employment of dozens of individuals from March to May 2018.\n\nThe USAID watchdog agency has reportedly shared its findings with senior USAID, State Department, and National Security Council staff, ultimately triggering widespread systemic changes to the aid agency\u2019s humanitarian assistance in Syria.\n\nAccording to the DOD IG, its counterpart at USAID also found that the al-Qaeda-affiliated HTS group has infiltrated NGO recipients of U.S. aid, something the agency is actively investigating.\n\nThe USAID IG failed to identify the NGOs in question and the specific amount diverted.\n\nThe Pentagon IG noted:\n\nUSAID OIG also investigated diversions of assistance to HTS in another NGO\u2019s programs, which OIG suspected was perpetrated by NGO staff affiliated with the terrorist group. Although the investigation is ongoing, the implementer voluntarily suspended portions of its programs, adapted its program to the changing risk environment, and terminated some employees.\n\nHTS jihadis have reportedly forced some NGO workers into diverting U.S. funds.\n\nThe Pentagon IG found:\n\nIn August 2018, USAID OIG referred its findings on the risks of humanitarian assistance being diverted to armed groups in northwestern Syria to USAID and briefed senior USAID officials. These risks included systemic coercion by HTS of NGO employees to assist in diversions; imposition of taxes, duties, and fees on USAID implementers and beneficiaries; HTS control of local councils and IDP [internally displaced persons] camp management that assist USAID implementers in identifying eligible beneficiaries; and implementers failing to adequately mitigate the threat to USAID programming from these armed group.\n\nAs a result of the USAID IG\u2019s findings, the Trump administration had refused to approve aid in HTS-controlled areas as of October 2018.\n\n\u201cUSAID also updated its risk analysis based on OIG findings and is engaging more closely with the U.S. interagency to mitigate risks from programming in northwest Syria,\u201d the Pentagon watchdog agency added.\n\nHTS mainly operates in its northwestern Syrian stronghold of Idlib province, where a deal reached between pro-opposition Turkey and Russia, dictator Bashar al-Assad\u2019s ally, has failed to push the jihadi group out.\n\nSeveral analysts have determined that the al-Qaeda branch in Syria is the terrorist group\u2019s most robust wing.", "President Donald Trump praised California law enforcement after they responded to a mass shooting at country music bar night.\n\nTwelve people were shot and killed as well as the alleged shooter.\n\nVentura County Sheriff\u2019s Sgt.

Later that night, he climbed up on the roof of the orphanage and saw fire lighting up the city.\n\n\u201cThen we knew: the synagogues were burning,\u201d he said. \u201cThe next morning, when I had to go to school, there was sparkling, broken glass everywhere on the streets.\u201d\n\nFrankenstein, now 94, was describing Kristallnacht \u2014 the \u201cNight of Broken Glass\u201d \u2014 when Nazis, among them many ordinary Germans, terrorized Jews throughout Germany and Austria. They killed at least 91 people and vandalized 7,500 Jewish businesses. They also burned more than 1,400 synagogues, according to Israel\u2019s Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial.\n\nUp to 30,000 Jewish men were arrested, many taken to concentration camps such as Dachau or Buchenwald. Hundreds more committed suicide or died as a result of the mistreatment in the camps years before the official mass deportations began.\n\nAs Germany marked the 80th anniversary of the anti-Jewish pogroms this week with a series of memorial events, Frankenstein returned to the place where he witnessed the violence as a teenager.\n\nOne of the dwindling number of Holocaust survivors, Frankenstein needed a walker as he slowly entered the compound where the Auerbach\u2019sches Waisenhaus orphanage once stood. But his memory is still sharp, and he remembers exactly how the events unfolded that night.\n\n\u201cA few hours after the plain clothes police officer had warned us, a group of men in uniforms came and told us, \u2018you need to leave now, we want to set fire to the building,\u2019\u201d Frankenstein said during an interview with The Associated Press this week.\n\nThere would have been no way to take the youngest children to a safe place that quickly, he said. Frankenstein and some of the older boys at the home managed to convince the uniformed men, who belonged to the paramilitary SA, that if they burned down the orphanage the fire would spread to surrounding buildings.\n\n\u201cSo instead, they went into our synagogue and turned off the sanctuary light in front of the holy ark,\u201d Frankenstein said. \u201cThey did not turn off the gas and after they left, we suddenly could smell gas everywhere inside the building.\u201d Frankenstein and his peers ran inside the synagogue, tore open all windows, and turned off the gas before it could lead to an explosion.\n\n\u201cThe men probably thought that if enough gas would stream out, the building would blow up,\u201d he said.\n\nKristallnacht is often referred to as the beginning of the Holocaust. It would still be years before the Nazis formally adopted their \u201cFinal Solution\u201d for the Jews of Europe, when boycotts, anti-Semitism legislation and expulsions would evolve into a policy of mass murder. In all, 6 million European Jews were killed in the Holocaust.\n\nGuy Miron, who heads Israel\u2019s Yad Vashem\u2019s Center for Research on the Holocaust in Germany, said Kristallnacht represented an end to Jewish life in Germany, a point of no return.\n\n\u201cUntil then, the Jews could still try to convince themselves that the wheel could be turned back. After it, the rupture was complete. They realized it was over,\u201d he said at a Yad Vashem event this week marking the anniversary. \u201cBefore Kristallnacht people emigrated. After it, they fled.\u201d\n\nStanding under an old poplar tree shedding its bright yellow leaves, Frankenstein gazed at a red brick wall \u2014 the only remainder of the orphanage in the city\u2019s Prenzlauer Berg neighborhood. The building was badly destroyed during a World War II air raid in 1943, and the ruins were torn down in the 1950s.\n\nThe wall was turned into a memorial for those Jewish orphans who did not survive the Holocaust, with the names and ages of 140 children inscribed on the bricks. The youngest one, Cilla Fuks, was ten months old when she was murdered.\n\nFrankenstein was one of the few who survived. In 1943 he went into hiding with his wife Leonie, whom he had met at the orphanage, as the Nazis were deporting thousands of Jews from Berlin to Auschwitz.\n\n\u201cWe had promised ourselves not to do what Hitler wanted,\u201d he said, still feisty after all these years. \u201cSo we went into hiding.\u201d\n\nTogether with their newborn son Uri, the couple spent 25 months in hiding in Berlin. A second son, Michael, was born in 1944, during their time on the run.\n\nIn 1945, after the collapse of the Nazis\u2019 Third Reich, the Frankensteins immigrated to what was then still Palestine.

In a meeting with Republican lawmakers before they left Washington for the August congressional recess, Mr. McCarthy warned that time was running short: Unless they intensified their campaign efforts and forcefully delivered a coherent message, he said, Republicans would suffer grievous losses in November. \u2026 By Labor Day, Republicans were fatally unprepared for an onslaught of Democratic campaign spending that overwhelmed their candidates from South Florida to Seattle. Party leaders on Capitol Hill and in the White House soon turned on one another and against their candidates with growing intensity. Two key groups \u2014 the National Republican Congressional Committee, the party\u2019s campaign arm in the House, and the Congressional Leadership Fund, a powerful Republican super PAC \u2014 plunged into all but open warfare over messaging and money. Democrats, in turn, delivered a message about health care with the repetitive force of a jackhammer. They cracked congressional maps drawn to favor Republicans and seized an array of open seats, while also felling longtime incumbents who had grown complacent.\n\nThe Times also slams Trump\u2019s focus on his \u201cHire American\u201d immigration policy, but it did not follow the money that would explain the huge political gaps between the nation\u2019s swing-voters and the establishment\u2019s cadre of wealthy, investment-maximizing donors.\n\nThe article does credit Democrats for using economic issues to win the middle-income swing-voters who decided the election. Party officials ignored many hot-button issues and narrowed their pitch to jobs and health care, said the Times:\n\nThat judgment was backed up by a vast trove of research, collected by Democratic committees and super PACs through polling and focus groups. House Majority PAC, the caucus\u2019s main super PAC, carried out two intensive research projects, studying right-of-center suburban voters and blue-collar whites who supported Mr. Trump. It concluded that only a message about health care and jobs could win over both groups.\n\nDemocrats passed President Barack Obama\u2019s Obamacare plan in 2010. Democrats and Republicans \u2014 including a young Paul Ryan \u2014 have jointly used immigration to divert jobs and wages away from American voters since at least 1990.

As I listen to you I\u2019m thinking that both you and I are old enough to remember that there was a lot of antagonism during the 1960s. There was a lot of antagonism during Watergate. There was certainly antagonism during the Clinton years. But there is something, maybe it\u2019s an undercurrent, that is different now. Can you put your finger on it? What is it?\n\nKING: Two things, Rick \u2014 the internet and cable news. Could you imagine cable news in Watergate? And they don\u2019t do news anymore. In fact, RT is one of the few channels doing news. RT does news. CNN stopped doing news a long time ago. They do Trump. Fox is Trump TV and MSNBC is anti-Trump all the time. You don\u2019t see a story \u2014 there was vicious winds and storms in the Northeast the other day \u2013 not covered on any of the three cable networks, not covered. Not covered! So when CNN started covering Trump \u2014 they were the first \u2014 they covered every speech he made and then they made Trump the story. So, Trump is the story in America. I would bet that ninety-eight percent of all Americans mention his name at least once a day. And when it\u2019s come to that, when you focus on one man, I know Donald 40 years \u2014 I know the good side of Donald and I know the bad side of Donald \u2014 I think he would like to be a dictator. I think he would love to be able to just run things. So, he causes a lot of this. Then his fight with the media and fake news. I\u2019ve been in the media a long time, like you \u2014 longer than you, Rick. And at all my years at CNN, in my years at Mutual Radio, I have never seen a conversation where a producer said to a host \u201cpitch the story this way. Angle it that way.

Never saw it.\n\nSANCHEZ: You know it\u2019s funny, just quick because you know these producers are telling me you guys have to start wrapping this up \u2026 you said something interesting about how CNN played along with Trump. I think they only played along or at least gave him that much airtime in many ways because they didn\u2019t think he was going to win, correct?\n\nKING: I guess it\u2019s to their regret. But, they covered him as a character. They carried every speech he made. They carried him more than Fox News, at the beginning.

Was Trump patting him on the head every time he\u2019d insult and humiliate Miller\u2019s former boss?\u201d\n\nCoulter told Breitbart News that out-going Kansas Secretary of States Kris Kobach ought to replace Sessions as attorney general, saying Kobach would \u201cfulfill Trump\u2019s immigration promises.\u201d\n\nAs for Sessions\u2019 tenure at DOJ, Coulter says she gives Sessions an A+ grade while giving every other member of Trump\u2019s administration a \u201cD to F\u201d grade, except for trade advisers Peter Navarro and Wilbur Ross, both of whom she gives an A grade.\n\nAs Breitbart News has chronicled, Sessions has been at the forefront of enacting Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d immigration agenda.

The second final rule provides protections to nonprofit organizations and small businesses that have non-religious moral convictions opposing services covered by the mandate. The religious and moral exemptions provided by these rules also apply to institutions of education, issuers, and individuals.\n\nThe regulations for the rules were proposed last year and finalized Wednesday.\n\nOne of the rules directs those who sell Obamacare health insurance plans that provide coverage for elective abortions to collect a separate payment from enrollees for that coverage, as is already required by law. The Obama administration, however, failed to enforce the law and allowed collection of abortion coverage together with regular premiums.\n\n\u201cThanks to this trickery, millions of Americans have unwittingly purchased plans without knowing about the hidden abortion surcharge,\u201d said Susan B. Anthony president Marjorie Dannenfelser. \u201cConsumers deserve to know how Obamacare pays for abortion so they can avoid having their hard-earned dollars used to fund the destruction of innocent lives.\u201d\n\nRegarding the protections for opponents of providing contraceptive measures, Dannenfelser said:\n\nNo longer will Catholic nuns who care for the elderly poor be forced by the government to provide abortion-inducing drugs in their health care plans. Not only that, moral objectors such as Susan B. Anthony List will also no longer have to pay for life-ending drugs that are antithetical to their mission and for which we have argued there is certainly no \u201ccompelling state interest.\u201d\n\n\u201cCongress must still act to eliminate abortion funding from Obamacare, but until then, the rule issued today is an important step in the right direction,\u201d Dannenfelser said.", "The White House on Wednesday evening suspended CNN reporter Jim Acosta\u2019s White House press room pass after a combative exchange with President Trump in which he refused to give up the microphone and wrangled with a female intern trying to take it back.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump believes in a free press and expects and welcomes tough questions of him and his Administration. We will, however, never tolerate a reporter placing his hands on a young woman just trying to do her job as a White House intern,\u201d White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThis conduct is absolutely unacceptable. It is also completely disrespectful to the reporter\u2019s colleagues not to allow them an opportunity to ask a question.\u201d\n\nShe continued:\n\nPresident Trump has given the press more access than any President in history. Contrary to CNN\u2019s assertions, there is no greater demonstration of the President\u2019s support for a free press than the event he held today. Only they would attack the President for not being supportive of a free press in the midst of him taking 68 questions from 35 different reporters over the course of an hour and a half \u2013 including several from the reporter in question. The fact that CNN is proud of the way their employee behaved is not only disgusting, it is an example of their outrageous disregard for everyone, including young women, who work in this Administration. As a result of today\u2019s incident, the White House is suspending the hard pass of the reporter involved until further notice.\n\nThe exchange happened Wednesday afternoon as the president was giving a press conference to discuss the results of the midterm election. Acosta began his question by saying he wanted to challenge him on calling the caravan an \u201cinvasion.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs you know, Mr. President, the caravan was not an invasion. It\u2019s a group of migrants moving up from Central America towards the border with the U.S. Why did you characterize it as such?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cBecause I consider it an invasion. You and I have a difference of opinion,\u201d Trump responded. Acosta then asked if he thought he \u201cdemonized immigrants\u201d in the midterm election.\n\nTrump responded, \u201cI want them to come into the country, but they have to come in legally. You know, they have to come in, Jim, through a process. I want it to be a process. And I want people to come in. And we need the people.\u201d\n\nAcosta then followed up with an assertion that migrants in the caravan would not be climbing over walls, and that they were \u201chundreds and hundreds of miles away.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s not an invasion,\u201d he told Trump.\n\nTrump told Acosta, \u201cHonestly, I think you should let me run the country, you run CNN \u2014 and if you did it well, your ratings would be much better.\u201d\n\nAcosta then attempted to ask another question, but Trump tried to move on several times. Acosta repeatedly refused to give up the microphone. When a female intern tried twice to take back the microphone, Acosta pushed her arm away.\n\nAcosta then asked two more questions before the intern succeeded in taking the microphone away.\n\nTrump told Acosta, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what: CNN should be ashamed of itself having you working for them. You are a rude, terrible person. You shouldn\u2019t be working for CNN.\u201d\n\nAcosta protested that he thought, \u201cthat\u2019s unfair.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a very rude person. The way you treat Sarah Huckabee is horrible. And the way you treat other people are horrible.

Referring to the U.S.-led coalition\u2019s At Tanf military base in southeastern Syria, the OIR IG noted:\n\nSeveral Iranian-backed militias also operate in the area, and their presence creates the potential for violence with U.S. troops and U.S.-backed forces. While the DoD [U.S Department of Defense] maintains that the purpose of the troop deployment at the garrison is to fight ISIS, it reiterated to the DoD OIG that the presence of the U.S. forces has the \u201cancillary benefit\u201d of restricting Iranian freedom of movement and deters Iranian activities in the area.\n\nIn Iraq, the threat against U.S. troops posed by Iranian proxies has intensified, the IG determined, noting that Tehran deployed between \u201c100 to 150 Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps\u2014 Quds Forces (IRGC-Quds Force) and Iranian Ministry of Intelligence personnel\u201d to Iraq in support of Tehran-allied Shiite militias during the quarter (July 1 thru September 30) covered by the report alone.\n\n\u201cThe DoD reported to the DoD OIG that if left unchecked, Iranian-sponsored harassment of U.S. forces could increase, and Iranian influence operations could increase as they vie for influence in the [newly elected Iraqi] government,\u201d the IG also reported, adding, \u201cAccording to the DoD, Iranian proxies continued threat messaging against the U.S. presence in Iraq and working to gain access to strategic locations for targeting and surveillance.\u201d\n\nThe inspector general acknowledged that Iranian proxies \u201clikely\u201d carried out two recent attacks against U.S. targets: mortars that landed near the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad and rocket attacks fired at the Basrah Airport near the U.S. Consulate General.\n\nTrump administration officials condemned Iran for the attacks, warning that Tehran would be held responsible for attacks by its proxies targeting American troops and facilities.\n\nThe Pentagon IG noted that the Trump administration has expanded its Syria mission to include the removal of Iran and Iranian proxies.\n\nIranian proxies in Iraq, which include the Baghdad-sanctioned Popular Mobilization Forces/Units (PMF/U), are also are increasing their \u201cthreatening posture toward US personnel,\u201d the inspector general reported, adding:\n\nThe DoD also reported that Iran has continued to provide significant support to armed groups in Iraq, including missiles and rockets that are transported through border crossing points. Other support included combat intelligence training, munitions, and Iranian military grade hardware such as drone surveillance operations. Iranian-backed groups have also engaged in running illegal checkpoints, smuggling, drug, and oil trafficking, bribery, and extortion, with uncontrolled Iranian proxy activity in Basrah and Anbar provinces serving as examples for the lawlessness of proxy groups inside Iraq.\n\nU.S. authorities have determined that Iran\u2019s terrorist proxy Hezbollah, known to operate in Iraq, is heavily involved in money laundering and drug trafficking. The group uses the lucrative profits from the illicit activities to fund its terrorist operations.\n\nAs a new wave of U.S. sanctions on Tehran \u2014 previously suspended under the controversial 2015 nuclear deal \u2014 kicked in early this week, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani warned that the restriction had triggered a \u201cwar situation.\u201d\n\nThe head of Iran\u2019s powerful IRG reportedly cautioned America that it imposed sanctions at its own peril.", "On Wednesday\u2019s broadcast of CNN\u2019s \u201cOutFront,\u201d Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) stated that the departure of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and his replacement by Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker is \u201ca kind of slow-motion Saturday Night Massacre,\u201d and \u201ca break the glass moment.\u201d\n\nBlumenthal said, \u201cIt\u2019s a break the glass moment.

The [State] Department has authorized rewards for information leading to the identification or location of the senior PKK members: Murat Karayilan (up to USD $5 million), Cemil Bayik (up to USD $4 million), and Duran Kalkan (up to USD $3 million).\n\nCiting Turkey\u2019s interior ministry, Reuters notes that the three PKK figures, described as leaders of the group, also appear on Ankara\u2019s \u201cmost wanted terrorists\u201d list.\n\nAnkara considers the PKK to be an extension of the Kurdish People\u2019s Protection Units (YPG) in Syria who receive support from the U.S.-led coalition\u2019s air campaign and American troops on the ground.\n\nTurkey, the United Staes, and the European Union have designated the PKK as a terrorist organization.\n\nThe U.S. reward offer came on the same day that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan blasted the United States for holding joint military patrols near the Turkish border in northern Syria with the YPG.\n\nU.S. troops carried out the patrols after Turkey began to bomb YPG targets in their stronghold east of the Euphrates.\n\nDespite Turkey\u2019s concerns over the Syrian Kurds\u2019 alleged ties to PKK terrorists, America considers the YPG to be the most capable force on the ground to take on the Islamic State (ISIS).\n\nAmerica\u2019s support for the YPG has infuriated Turkey.

It\u2019s a win for social justice and equality to have this close-minded individual out of such an impactful office. We\u2019ll have to wait and see how Matthew Whitaker approaches cannabis, but it can\u2019t get much worse than Sessions, and hopefully this is the start of some federal progress and protection for those participating in cannabis in the many states that have enacted laws.

And quite a few things he announced were inconsistent with other parts of the government. Ultimately most of his anti cannabis rhetoric and attempted policies did not have a granular impact. The hope is that there will a lot less confusion and distracting noise coming out of the AG\u2019s office on a go forward basis.\n\nWe also still expect the White House to move forward with legalizing medical cannabis at the federal level before the 2020 elections and having an AG that is on board with that would be helpful for all.\u201d\n\n\u2014\n\nCharlie Finnie, Chief Strategy Officer of MariMed Inc.: \u201cAlthough we wish Mr. Sessions well, he was woefully out of step with the American people with regard to the myriad health and wellness benefits of cannabis.

Former AG Sessions and other government officials lose credibility by maintaining that cannabis has no medicinal value when our own FDA has approved a cannabis derived drug for treating epilepsy.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly stated he will protect state\u2019s rights relative to cannabis and more recently, he stated he is exploring ending the prohibition on cannabis. We are optimistic that a new Attorney General will take President Trump\u2019s cue and quickly reinstate the Cole memo to end ambiguity regarding state\u2019s rights in this matter. Additionally, we hope the new Attorney General will determine that it is not wise to spend tax dollars on incarcerating thousands of people for marijuana convictions, when cannabis has been proven to be safer than the alcohol found in almost every American household.\u201d\n\n\u2014\n\nWil Ralston, President of SinglePoint: \u201cJeff Sessions\u2019 resignation could be a huge event for the cannabis industry, since Sessions has openly been against the industry and used his powers to slow the growth.

It is wrong and shameful that journalists and news organizations that should seek the truth would traffic in such lies. I never led a chant calling for death to America. To say otherwise is a blatant falsehood and an attempt to paint me as an enemy in a very dangerous time as tension rises between America and Iran and nations around the earth reject unjust sanctions and heavy-handed U.S. foreign policy. I asked a question about how to pronounce the chant in Farsi during my meeting with Iranian students and an examination of the video shows just that. My point was to engage students in a talk about what gives a nation perpetuity versus that which undermines and destroys a nation. Evil, falsehood and violation of divine law doom nations to destruction, and the holy books of the world\u2019s three greatest monotheistic religions warn us of such. So if Iran is moving as a nation to obey God\u2019s law, to respect and educate women and to pursue righteousness, she is on a right course. And, if America has violated the principles of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness for the indigenous people and destroyed them, and if she has done the same for the Black and the Poor, America has not only violated Constitutional principles, she has disobeyed divine law and stands to be judged by God for her wrongdoing. And, American democracy, unfortunately, has always leaned toward and protected the interests of the White, the Rich and the Powerful.\n\nRead Farrakhan\u2019s full statement here.\n\nFarrakhan also linked to his statement via Twitter, which has refused to ban him despite his bigoted statements \u2014 even though it has banned other users for far less (or, in some cases, for unexplained reasons).\n\nFarrakhan has been closely allied with leading Democrats, including Rep.

I think for people in Congress, they need to step up and object to this.

There are a number of senior political appointees at the Justice Department. Republican appointees who believe in the rule of law and believe in this investigation, believe in what Bob Mueller and Rosenstein have done. The country needs to hear from them in the next few days.

In every administration, that\u2019s the case. How would the intelligence community work with somebody like Mr. Whitaker [Sessions\u2019s temporary replacement], who has his thumb on the scale? We already know exactly how he feels about the Mueller probe. He has pre-judged it before it\u2019s come to its conclusion. We already know how he feels about Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s participation in the Trump tower meeting. He thinks it\u2019s a nothing burger. That is something under investigation by Robert Mueller in both the obstruction of justice prong of that investigation, for the lies told afterward, and the conspiracy to coordinate with a foreign government, an American adversary, the other avenue.\n\nHow would career professionals in the law enforcement community and other U.S. Attorney\u2019s offices \u2014 the Southern District of New York that also has big cases against the president, Michael Cohen has alleged that Donald Trump directed him to pay hush money to a porn star \u2014 how do career national security, intelligence, and law enforcement officials deal with somebody who is essentially a political stand-in for the president\u2019s interests?\n\nBRENNAN: I think the intelligence community professionals and those professionals within the Department of Justice and FBI have had quite a bit of experience having to deal with political loyalists who are appointed to senior positions. But in most instances \u2014 not all instances \u2014 in most instances, when those political loyalists get into positions of tremendous responsibility and authority, and they realize the gravity of these issues, they tend to take the right path because they should not be complicit in any type of action that is going to inhibit and thwart the rule of law. So Jeff Sessions, credit to him, for recusing himself. And so Matt Whitaker comes with a lot of baggage and it\u2019s going to be quite evident whether or not he is going to fulfill his responsibilities now in that position.\n\n\u2026\n\nWALLACE: Are you saying that Mr. Whitaker, with his public statements, public writings, and his comments on television should be recused from overseeing the Mueller probe, based on those statements?\n\nBRENNAN: I would think that there is a very strong case that, given his public acknowledgment of his prejudiced view on this issue, that he should recuse himself. I think there are a lot of people out there raising their eyebrows now, rightly so, and wondering whether Matt Whitaker in this acting capacity, has the credentials, has the credibility needed to lead the Department of Justice at such a crucial and critical time in our history when we indeed may be facing a constitutional crisis very soon.", "Wednesday on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cLive,\u201d Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez said President Donald Trump removing Attorney General Jeff Sessions and appointing Matthew Whitaker as acting attorney general was \u201cworse than\u201d the Watergate scandal.\n\nPerez said, \u201cThere\u2019s a law, and there\u2019s a test that applies to what he just did. The law is the Vacancies Reform Act. You can argue that it\u2019s ambiguous whether he could do what he just did. There\u2019s a test that is very unambiguous called the smell test.

On a certain level, this is worse than Watergate because the Saturday Night Massacre, he kept firing Senate-confirmed people until he found Bork who was a Senate-confirmed person to do this.

Police have charged Laura Ebert, an economics lecturer at the State University of New York, New Paltz, with the theft.\n\nEbert was charged with misdemeanor larceny for stealing the signs, which were used to promote Republican candidates John Faso and Marc Molinaro, who both lost their races on Tuesday.\n\nIn a comment, McGovern condemned Ebert for betraying the principles of free expression that academics are supposed to defend. \u201cI kind of thought it was funny in a way, because of the times, you hear about stories of the professors being very liberal and not allowing people with conservative or Republican views to speak\u2026almost like trying to shut down my voice, which seems antithetical to what a professor should be doing because we should all have a voice,\u201d McGovern said.\n\nIn a comment, Ebert apologized for her actions. \u201cI have family I love that support Trump, so I was after the sign, not the person,\u201d Ebert said. \u201cI have apologized and feel bad, but clearly the GOP is putting a big deal [of] spin on this.

The Justice Department on Wednesday indicated that Whitaker would indeed supervise the Mueller investigation.\n\n\u201cThe Acting Attorney General is in charge of all matters under the purview of the Department of Justice,\u201d Justice Department spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores told Breitbart News in an email.\n\nIn a sign of how Whitaker would handle the Mueller investigation if he does take oversight, he notably authored a piece for CNN last August, entitled, \u201cMueller\u2019s investigation of Trump is going to far.\u201d\n\nWhitaker wrote that Trump is \u201cabsolutely correct\u201d that Mueller investigating the finances of Trump and his family as part of the investigation would cross a line.\n\n\u201cThe President is absolutely correct. Mueller has come up to a red line in the Russia 2016 election-meddling investigation that he is dangerously close to crossing,\u201d Whitaker wrote in the piece.\n\nHe also wrote that it was \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d that some Trump associates were being investigated \u201cto encourage subjects of the investigation to cooperate.\u201d He wrote:\n\nThis information is deeply concerning to me. It does not take a lawyer or even a former federal prosecutor like myself to conclude that investigating Donald Trump\u2019s finances or his family\u2019s finances falls completely outside of the realm of his 2016 campaign and allegations that the campaign coordinated with the Russian government or anyone else. That goes beyond the scope of the appointment of the special counsel. In fact, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein\u2019s letter appointing special counsel Robert Mueller does not give Mueller broad, far-reaching powers in this investigation. He is only authorized to investigate matters that involved any potential links to and coordination between two entities \u2014 the Trump campaign and the Russian government. People are wrongly pointing to, and taking out of context, the phrase \u201cany matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation\u201d to characterize special counsel\u2019s authority as broad. The word \u201cinvestigation\u201d is clearly defined directly preceding it in the same sentence specifically as coordination between individuals associated with the campaign of Donald Trump and Russia. The Trump Organization\u2019s business dealings are plainly not within the scope of the investigation, nor should they be.\n\nWhitaker wrote that any investigation into Trump or his family\u2019s finances would require Mueller to return to Rosenstein for additional authority, and that if he did not, it would raise concerns that the investigation was a \u201cmere witch hunt.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf Mueller is indeed going down this path, Rosenstein should act to ensure the investigation is within its jurisdiction and within the authority of the original directive,\u201d he said.\n\nWhitaker wrote:\n\nIt is time for Rosenstein, who is the acting attorney general for the purposes of this investigation, to order Mueller to limit the scope of his investigation to the four corners of the order appointing him special counsel. If he doesn\u2019t, then Mueller\u2019s investigation will eventually start to look like a political fishing expedition. This would not only be out of character for a respected figure like Mueller, but also could be damaging to the President of the United States and his family \u2014 and by extension, to the country.\n\nIf Whitaker takes over overseeing the investigation, in his view, Mueller would have to ask him for additional authority to investigate Trump\u2019s finances.\n\nRosenstein\u2019s future has also been under question, after the New York Times reported in September that he allegedly suggested he could wear a wire in the Oval Office with Trump, and discussed using the 25th Amendment to have the president removed.\n\nRosenstein denied the report\u2019s accuracy, but has avoided meeting with House Republicans to discuss the matter. He has also irritated House Republicans for fulfilling lawmakers\u2019 requests for documents as they investigate DOJ and FBI bias in their investigation of the Trump campaign.\n\nRosenstein has also drawn heavy criticism from House Republicans for not recusing himself from overseeing the investigation, since he was involved in the FBI\u2019s investigation of the Trump campaign. He had signed off on a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant that allowed the FBI to surveil former Trump campaign aide Carter Page.\n\nWhitaker\u2019s appointment comes the day after the midterm elections, when Democrats regained control of the House.

Sessions Ending Obama\u2019s DACA Amnesty\n\nIn September 2017, Sessions executed Trump\u2019s promise by ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program which gave amnesty to more than million illegal aliens.\n\n\u201cTo have a lawful system of immigration that serves the national interest, we cannot admit everyone who would like to come here,\u201d Sessions said at the time. \u201cThat is an open border policy and the American people have rightly rejected it.\u201d\n\n\u201cTherefore, the nation must set and enforce a limit on how many immigrants we admit each year and that means all cannot be accepted,\u201d Sessions declared.\n\n2. Sessions Suing California over Sanctuary State Law\n\nIn March, Sessions announced a lawsuit by his Department of Justice (DOJ) to fight California\u2019s expansive circumvention of federal immigration law through their sanctuary state policy that gives refuge to criminal illegal aliens.\n\nSessions actually traveled to California to deliver his speech announcing his suing of the state for their sanctuary state law, a determined move by the attorney general.\n\n3. Sessions\u2019 Pro-American Asylum Reforms\n\nWith gridlock on ending the immigration and asylum loopholes of the Obama administration the Republican-controlled Congress, Sessions took action against the open-ended asylum rules of the past.\n\nSessions tightened asylum rules to exclude migrants who claimed to be fleeing gang violence and domestic abuse. These two claims made millions of Central Americans eligible for asylum under Obama, but have since been closed to enforce asylum rules as they were intended.\n\n4. Sessions Cracking Down on Anti-American Discrimination\n\nIn a series of settlements with companies, Sessions\u2019 DOJ has investigated, prosecuted, and fined businesses that hired illegal aliens, foreign nationals, and foreign guest visa workers instead of eligible American citizens.\n\nMost recently, Sessions fined a housekeeping company for hiring H-2B foreign workers over American citizens.\n\nPreviously, Sessions penalized and fined a landscaping company in North Carolina for discriminating against Americans in their hiring practices, favoring foreign workers instead. A Colorado corporation, last year, was fined by Sessions\u2018 DOJ for importing foreign workers without trying to hire Americans first for farming jobs.\n\n5. Sessions Building a Legal Wall to Block Illegal Immigration\n\nOne of the most pivotal measures taken by Sessions has been building a legal wall to stop ineligible asylum-seekers and illegal aliens from entering the U.S. through the southern border.\n\nSessions has deployed more immigration judges and additional prosecutors to the border while instructing the legal arm of immigration law to take action.\n\n\u201cI have directed our U.S. Attorneys at the border to take whatever immediate action to ensure that we have sufficient prosecutors available,\u201d Sessions said in April when a caravan of migrants was headed to the border. \u201cI have also directed that we commit any additional necessary immigration judges to adjudicate any [asylum] cases that may arise from this \u2018caravan.'\u201d\n\n6. Sessions Increasing Rejection Rate of False Asylum-Seekers\n\nSessions\u2019 asylum reforms have successfully kept out ineligible asylum-seekers from the U.S., as Breitbart News\u2019s Neil Munro most recently reported:\n\nIn June, one-in-six asylum applicants were rejected at the border, up from one-in-10 during April and May, according to the April-to-June report recently issued by the Department of Homeland Security. The test, dubbed the \u201cCredible Fear\u201d test, is vital because migrants who fail the test can be quickly deported without being released.

But on trade policy, one of the areas most relevant for the international community, Trump enjoys executive power and can set the terms regardless of whether Congress is divided or not. That\u2019s because \u201cCongress doesn\u2019t have much of an ability to control trade policy,\u201d analysts at RBC Capital Markets wrote in a recent note. Rather, \u201cthe Oval Office has wide reaching powers to act unilaterally,\u201d which means the president is likely to \u201ckeep pushing his trade agenda,\u201d they continued. \u201cOn trade, it\u2019s going to be the same, if not worse, in terms of U.S.-China,\u201d Steven Okun, senior advisor at McLarty Associates, told CNBC as election results were trickling in.\n\nFormer U.S. ambassador to Singapore David Adelman added that Democrats are traditionally \u201cthe more protectionist party,\u201d while Republicans have grown \u201cextremely hawkish\u201d on China, so the trade war might be one of the few issues where the two parties share abundant common ground.\n\nAdelman predicted Democrats would likely push back if Trump attempts to impose tariffs on the European Union or pull out of the World Trade Organization.\n\nThe UK Daily Express went further and cited analysts who thought President Trump\u2019s trade war could \u201cintensify\u201d during the next Congress. The Express thought China\u2019s assessment of the situation might already be prodding Beijing to offer an olive branch or two because the midterms did not produce the kind of result that could greatly weaken the Trump White House or force changes in its trade policy.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats have retaken the US House of Representatives, dealing a major blow to President Donald Trump\u2019s domestic agenda, but if anxious politicians in Beijing think that means a reprieve from the White House, they should think again,\u201d CNN advised on Wednesday, making a similar argument that House Democrats can do little to help Beijing and probably wouldn\u2019t be inclined to do so if they could.\n\nHong Kong professor Willy Lam suggested China\u2019s seemingly all-powerful President Xi Jinping might be taking more domestic political heat for the trade war than Trump: \u201cHe has been widely criticized, not by name of course, but subtly, for failing to handle Trump\u2019s multi-pronged challenge. He\u2019s very much on the defensive.\u201d", "Console gaming giant Nintendo has removed a Native American reference from its hotly anticipated game Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, after the company received complaints and allegations of racism.\n\nIn the upcoming game Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Nintendo has included a retro character from a crude early 1980\u2019s handheld game which featured a Native American parody in a loincloth and holding a torch.\n\n\u201cMr. Game & Watch is a retro character from a line of handhelds Nintendo released in the 1980s. One of his moves is reportedly a reference to \u2018Fire Attack,\u2019 a 1982 game where the player is a Civil War-era general defending a fort from torch-wielding Indians,\u201d explained Variety. \u201cWhen he uses it, he transforms into a stereotypical Indian wearing a loincloth and feather, and he attacks with a flaming torch.\u201d\n\nSome users on Twitter accused Nintendo of racism after the character was revealed, while left-wing gaming blogs, including Gawker\u2019s Kotaku, and Polygon, also criticized the \u201cracist\u201d depiction \u2014 prompting Nintendo to apologize and promise to modify the game to appease the journalists and social justice warriors.\n\nPlease check and spread the below thread from ResetEra.

Ultimate\u2019 an experience that is both welcoming and fun for everyone,\u201d the company continued.\n\nNintendo has previously been accused of racism, with Nintendo Switch\u2019s Street Fighter 2, Arms, and a large variety of other titles.\n\nLast year, Nintendo also removed sombreros from Super Mario Odyssey following accusations of racism and \u201ccultural appropriation.\u201d", "That\u2019s all you got?\n\nTwo years of non-stop campaigning, denouncing and doxing \u2014 and all the Resistance has to show for it is a House majority smaller than the one Republicans currently have and a net loss of three Senate seats? (Thank you, Justice Brett Kavanaugh!)\n\nDemocratic leaders may try saying, \u201cTHIS IS JUST WHAT WE WANTED! We wanted to be down by three Senate seats.\u201d But I think their voters are saying, We were hoping for more of a rebuke.\n\nThe media exhausted itself on this election! Can they go back to that level of hysteria today?\n\nPresident Clinton lost 54 House seats and eight Senate seats in his first midterm, as voters responded to Hillary\u2019s attempt to socialize health care. President Obama lost 63 House seats and six Senate seats in his first midterm, as voters responded to the Democrats\u2019 successful party-line vote to socialize health care.\n\nAmerica\u2019s response to Trump\u2019s first two years? Republicans lost fewer than 40 House seats and gained Senate seats. (Again: Thank you, Justice Kavanaugh.)\n\nAnd that was with more than 40 House Republicans being spooked into retiring rather than go down to certain defeat in what the media convinced them would be a big blue wave.\n\nIt\u2019s always a bad idea to give Democrats control of any part of government. You don\u2019t want those guys running a lemonade stand.\n\nBut \u2014 wow \u2014 are there silver linings!\n\nFirst, all the worst Republican House members were defeated, such as cheap labor advocate Kevin Yoder of Kansas and Florida\u2019s Rep. Carlos Curbelo, a second-generation immigrant who goes around calling his fellow Republicans white supremacists. (Alleged white supremacist Steve King won and Curbelo lost \u2014 hahahahaha!)\n\nAs the movie character Ninotchka said of Stalin\u2019s reign of terror: \u201cThe last mass trials were a great success! There are going to be fewer but better Russians.\u201d\n\nSecond, the main accomplishment of the Resistance in the first midterm was to help Trump win his re-election bid.\n\nEven voters skeptical about Trump will embrace him after two minutes, let alone two years, of watching Speaker Nancy Pelosi run the House, Rep. Maxine Waters chair the House Financial Services Committee, Rep. Jerry Nadler head the Judiciary Committee \u2014 and Rep. Adam Schiff run around issuing subpoenas all over town.\n\nHow about Rep. Alcee Hastings, an impeached and convicted bribe-taker? His seniority surely requires giving him a committee chairmanship! Is Pelosi going to discriminate against Hastings just because he\u2019s a proud black man? Right now, Pelosi is trying to determine which committee chairmanship requires no honesty whatsoever.\n\nIf you were hoping the Democrats would seize this opportunity to make utter fools of themselves \u2014 impeachment hearings, resurrecting the Kavanaugh gang rape claims, and Russia, Russia, Russia \u2014 I\u2019ve got good news! That\u2019s exactly what their base is demanding. I promise you, Maxine Waters is not going to say, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, guys. I\u2019ll be keeping a very low profile.\u201d\n\nVoters will be pleading, Couldn\u2019t we get an infrastructure bill? Will you please do something about all these criminal aliens in my sanctuary city? And the Democrats will be carrying on about Trump\u2019s taxes.\n\nThe Senate math was on Republicans\u2019 side, but countering that were several GOP retirements. Republicans not only held the Senate with a bigger margin \u2026 but now with no Jeff Flake, John McCain or Bob Corker!\n\nThe only GOP senator to lose his re-election was Dean Heller of Nevada. That makes him the fourth Republican who supported Marco Rubio\u2019s 2013 amnesty bill to lose his seat. Inasmuch as about 85 percent of incumbent senators win re-election, at least for the past quarter-century, this is quite an accomplishment!\n\nMercifully, of the 14 GOP traitors who voted for Rubio\u2019s amnesty, only six remain in office. Four were beaten, three retired one step ahead of the guillotine and one took the easy way out by dying.\n\nWhich raises the question: What exactly was Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s plan for victory? Hope a Supreme Court justice retired and that the Democrats would make vicious and false claims against our nominee?\n\nThe Republicans\u2019 stunning Senate victories resulted from nothing they did. These are the guys who ran like little girls from Trump\u2019s campaign promises on immigration. Republicans didn\u2019t even bother forcing Democrats to cast wildly unpopular votes on the wall, sanctuary cities or anchor babies. In fact, Republicans did very little of interest to any voters.\n\nThe one and only reason Republicans picked up Senate seats in a midterm election is the utter derangement of the Resistance, which \u2014 by complete happenstance \u2014 was recently put on display when Democrats got the bright idea to falsely accuse a sweet nerd like Brett Kavanaugh of gang rape.\n\nAs Trump is accused of the foulest treason over the next two years, he might want to remember Kavanaugh.\n\nYou think having MSNBC gloat over your tax returns and Robert Mueller accusing you of collusion with Russia is outrageous? I imagine it was also unpleasant to be accused from every media outlet of gang rape. But Justice Kavanaugh and his family soldiered on, winning the nomination \u2014 and winning three Senate seats for the GOP.\n\nJust remember, Mr. President, every time Adam Schiff appears on TV, the RNC should be sending a receipt to the Democrats.", "President Donald Trump called out the Republican 2018 midterm election candidates who rejected his help and lost their races.\n\nTrump recounted in the reporter-filled White House East Room press conference Wednesday that some of the midterm election candidates pushed him away, essentially disassociating with the president. \u201cThey did very poorly,\u201d he said.\n\nPresident @realDonaldTrump addresses the Republican midterm candidates who refused his help and lost \u2013 \u201cMia Love gave me no love, and she lost.

This in spite of major Republican victories in Florida for Ron DeSantis who won the race to become Florida\u2019s next governor and Rick Scott who was ahead Wednesday in the election for a Florida U.S. Senate seat. Trump campaigned in the state for both of these candidates.\n\nIncumbent Republican Rep. Mike Coffman was the next midterm candidate Trump called out on Wednesday for refusing his help. Coffman lost his re-election bid in Colorado to Democrat challenger Jason Crow. \u201cToo bad Mike,\u201d said Trump.\n\nRep. Mia Love was the third name Trump listed.

Peter Roskam and Eric Paulson \u201cDidn\u2019t want the embrace,\u201d said Trump of the incumbent Republican congressmen from Illinois\u2019 sixth and Minnesota\u2019s third congressional districts. Roskam lost to Democrat challenger Sean Casten. Paulson lost heavily to Democrat challenger Dean Phillips.\n\nRepublican businessman Bob Hugin challenged scandal-laden Democrat Rep.

Trump lamented the loss, \u201cI feel badly\u2026That\u2019s a race that could have been won.\u201d Hugin was the one non-incumbent Trump called out.\n\nEighth on Trump\u2019s list was incumbent Republican Rep.

There were huge countries that have occupied and transferred populations and no one talks about them,\u201d Netanyahu was quoted by Army Radio as saying Monday during the closed-door meeting, in remarks translated by the Times of Israel.\n\n\u201cPower changes everything and it changes our policies vis-a-vis Arab states, and there are other countries on the way,\u201d he added, in an apparent reference to blossoming relations between Israel and some Arab nations.\n\nHe also seemed to throw out the notion of land for peace.\n\n\u201cContrary to the notion that concessions will bring about agreements with the Arabs, concessions will only bring about slight and short-term changes and nothing more,\u201d Netanyahu said about giving up territory to the Palestinians. \u201cWhat we need to do is advance [talks] on shared interests with Israel based on technological power.\u201d\n\nHis comments come on the heels of a state visit to Oman last week where he met with Sultan Sayyid Qaboos bin Said Al Said.

She dedicated her victory, in part, to the Palestinian cause: \u201cA lot of my strength comes from being Palestinian,\u201d she said.\n\nAfter Tlaib won her primary race in August, she published several anti-Israel tweets, and re-tweeted a fan who declared that Tlaib\u2019s \u201cfirst fight was for Palestine, always Palestine.\u201d\n\nTlaib explicitly supports the destruction of the Jewish state of Israel and its replacement of a unitary Palestinian state. That position caused her to lose the endorsement of the far-left group J Street \u2014 which, while often adopting anti-Israel positions, nominally supports a two-state solution.\n\nOne other Palestinian-American was on the ballot on Tuesday: Ammar Campa-Najjar, the grandson of a Palestinian terrorist who was Yasser Arafat\u2019s deputy and was involved in the murder of 11 Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympics in Munich, Germany, lost in California\u2019s 50th congressional district.\n\nJoel B.

The Iranians greatly preferred the administration Biden served to the one currently occupying the White House.\n\nPressTV ran down the poll results for Democrats, asserting that Biden has the most support from Democrat primary voters and was also favored to beat Trump 51-39 in the general election:\n\nThe Reuters/Ipsos exit poll found that 29 percent of voters supported a Biden nomination, putting him at top of the list of Democratic runners for the upcoming presidential election. Finishing second in the hypothetical field with 22 percent was Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, an Independent whose 2016 candidacy was allegedly sabotaged by Democrats in favor of former First lady Hillary Clinton. Tying the rest of the poll were Senators Cory Booker of New Jersey, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Kamala Harris of California. On the Republican side, 65 percent of midterm voters said they would like to see Trump run for a second term in 2020. Another 11 percent said they would prefer a presidential push by Vice President Mike Pence and 12 percent said they did not know yet.\n\nThe Iranian outlet qualified these observations by noting that \u201copinion polls this early always favor candidates who enjoy wider name recognition.\u201d\n\nBiden has been a strident critic of President Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal negotiated by the Obama administration.\n\n\u201cTalk of a \u2018better deal\u2019 is an illusion. It took years of sanctions pressure, painstaking diplomacy, and the full support of the international community to achieve that goal. We have none of that in place today,\u201d Biden said in May.\n\nHe predicted pulling out of the nuclear deal would \u201cput Iran back on the path to a nuclear weapon with no clear diplomatic way out,\u201d as well as putting the United States on a \u201ccollision course\u201d with its allies.\n\nBiden said as recently as last month that he had no plans to run in 2020, although he did not completely rule out the possibility. He said he would make a firm decision by January. If so, he would face mounting scrutiny of revelations into his business dealings since leaving the office of the vice presidency. This year, the book Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends by Government Accountability Institute President and Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large Peter Schweizer revealed that Biden\u2019s son Hunter secured a billion-dollar deal with the government-owned Bank of China through his own company during his father\u2019s tenure. Neither Biden has answered questions regarding how that deal occurred or what the nature of such a negotiation with Beijing was.", "China\u2019s attempt to weaken support for President Donald Trump and the Republican Party by targeting U.S. agriculture with retaliatory tariffs did not work.\n\nRepublican candidates in Congressional districts with heavy soybean production faired very well in the midterm elections Tuesday. In America\u2019s top soybean producing Congressional district, Iowa\u2019s first, Rep. Steve King won re-election by more than a three-point margin. In North Dakota, whose single Congressional district is America\u2019s second highest soy producer, Kelly Armstrong defeated her Democrat opponent with a twenty-five point margin.\n\nIn the twenty highest soy producing Congressional districts, Democrats won just a two seats formerly held by a Republican: Iowa\u2019s first, the ninth highest soy producer, and Iowa\u2019s third, the sixteenth highest soy producer. But those losses were offset by Republicans flipping Arkansas\u2019 first district, the eighth highest soy producer.\n\nAlan Tonelson points out that the same holds true for farming more broadly.\n\nTo see how off-base the \u201cRepublican Soy-Mageddon\u201d (\u201cSoy-Pocalypse\u201d?) predictions were, let\u2019s first look at the returns from the Top Twenty districts in the House of Representatives in terms of total agricultural output. Republicans held sixteen and Democrats four when the evening began. When it ended, the number of those seats flipped by the Democrats (i.e., where one of their candidates beat a Republican incumbent) totaled one: the First District of Iowa. The other three Democratic victories were scored by Democratic incumbents. Republicans flipped none of these 20 seats. But they held on to 15. Moreover, three of these seats were open seats \u2013 that is, a Republican incumbent had retired. So all else equal, the Democratic candidate\u2019s chances of winning were increased. The race for the twentieth seat on this list \u2013 Minnesota\u2019s First District \u2013 was too close to call at the time of this writing. It\u2019s an open seat also, but the previous incumbent was a Democrat. So no sign of any blue wave, or any notable Democratic strength in this group of Districts, whatever.\n\nSince Tonelson\u2019s article was posted, Republican candidate Jim Hagedorn has been declared the winner. Which means the GOP flipped as many of the top agriculture seats as Democrats did.", "The cartel violence in Tijuana continues with at least 36 murders registered in the first week of November, bringing the unofficial total to 2,124 for 2018.\n\nThe cartel killings are related to the street level distribution of drugs, despite numerous measures taken by the federal government to intervene, according to local reporting and law enforcement sources.\n\nOn Monday, November 5, a male victim was gunned down while his female companion was critically wounded. An unknown male also sustained gunshot wounds in colonia Ermita, according to local reports.\n\nOn the morning of November 6, a male victim was found stabbed to death inside his residence in colonia Guaycura.

Police later reported that at approximately 3:40 pm, a suitcase was found containing dismembered human remains in colonia 20 de Noviembre. At approximately 8 pm, a male victim was found shot to death in colonia Mariano Matamoros Centro.\n\nBreitbart News reported extensively on the cartel violence in Tijuana and recently noted when local Deputy Attorney General Jorge Alberto \u00c1lvarez Mendoza acknowledged that only two percent of murder cases end in convictions.\n\nBreitbart News spoke with local law enforcement contacts who said that the main factor for cartel violence is the low risk of apprehension. Most experts grant that a very small number of criminals are responsible for the overwhelming majority of violent cases. Cartel killers are more likely to be stopped by rival factions than law enforcement.\n\nIn a recent development, the state attorney general\u2019s office announced the arrest of a cartel hitman responsible for the murders of at least nine in Tijuana. Manuel Coria Rosas aka \u201cEl Coria\u201d or \u201cEl Me\u00f1o,\u201d 56, allegedly murdered nine victims in three separate attacks. Rosas was named in three homicide arrest warrants\u2013the first on December 3, 2017, where one male was gunned down in colonia Las Torres. The second occurred on May 12, 2018, in colonia Magisterial where five were gunned down. The third warrant was for a triple murder on August 30.

You\u2019ve seen that \u2014 plenty of grandstanding. But for certain reasons, that many people, you\u2019re always going to have a couple that won\u2019t do it.

I don\u2019t agree with them on a lot of policy, but I agree with them on sticking together. They stick together great.\n\nSo now, we go into the Senate, we don\u2019t have the 10 votes, and what happens? It doesn\u2019t get passed.

The Senate appropriations bill includes $1.6 billion for fence construction in 2019. The House bill includes $5 billion for wall construction but packages it with a series of bills to provide business groups with additional cheap visa-workers.\n\nHowever, a DHS shutdown would have a minor civic impact. Border enforcement would continue because it is a national security task, and the agency\u2019s award of green cards and work permits would continue because those operations are funded by fees from recipients.\n\nAlso, Trump has repeatedly said in recent weeks that he will get $1.6 billion for the border fence in 2019. Those statements suggest he is willing to accept the Senate\u2019s funding, presumably without the House\u2019s package of $5 billion plus the extra visa-workers.\n\nTrump said:\n\nMany Democrats know we need the wall, And we\u2019re just going to have to see what happens. We\u2019ll be fighting for it \u2026 I got the military $700 billion and $716 billion [for 2018 and 2019], the wall is a tiny, tiny fraction of the cost of that, but the [Democrats\u2019] whole agenda has been to try not giving me anything for the wall. I really believe, politically, they are hurting themselves. I actually think, politically, that is a good thing for me, but I want to get the wall up because we need [it].\n\nTrump also suggested he would be willing to negotiate a deal over President Barack Obama\u2019s DACA amnesty once the Supreme Court allows him to end the program. In 2018, \u201cwe could have done some pretty good work on DACA, but a judge ruled that DACA was OK,\u201d he said, adding:\n\nHad a judge not ruled that way, I think we would have made a deal. Once the judge ruled that way, the Democrats did not want to talk any more.

They also found judges that didn\u2019t approve it, so it is obviously going to be determined in the Supreme Court. If the court rules in favor of what President Obama thinks they should rule \u2013 which is what he said \u2014 then I will probably have a deal with the Democrats in a very short period of time.

In a lengthy Instagram post, Swift told her nearly 113 million followers that she was backing the Democratic Senate nominee due to her support of LGBTQ rights. The singer also claimed she could not support Blackburn because of the United States\u2019 \u201csystemic racism.\u201d\n\n\u201cI always have and always will cast my vote based on which candidate will protect and fight for the human rights I believe we all deserve in this country,\u201d Swift wrote. \u201cI believe in the fight for LGBTQ rights, and that any form of discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender is WRONG. I believe that the systemic racism we still see in this country towards people of color is terrifying, sickening and prevalent.\u201d\n\n\u201cI cannot vote for someone who will not be willing to fight for dignity for ALL Americans, no matter their skin color, gender or who they love,\u201d the singer added. \u201cRunning for Senate in the state of Tennessee is a woman named Marsha Blackburn.

She was sentenced to death by hanging in 2010. Pakistan\u2019s Supreme Court overturned her conviction a week ago, asserting that no evidence existed for the blasphemy charge and that those who had falsely accused her of the crime were themselves guilty of blasphemy.\n\nIn response, the radical Islamist Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) party organized thousands-strong riots in major cities demanding the deaths of both Bibi and the Supreme Court justices who acquitted her, resulting in rampant violence and destruction of property. Riots ended on Friday after the government agreed to hear yet another appeal on Bibi\u2019s blasphemy case and begin the legal process to ban her from leaving the country while ordering the TLP to \u201capologize\u201d for forcing the shutdown of schools and businesses. Government officials confirmed on Wednesday that they had only begun appraising the destruction left behind by the protests.\n\nBibi\u2019s family have begun applying for asylum in the West, noting that the riots are proof they cannot ensure a safe future for themselves in a country where mobs are demanding their death.\n\nAfridi, in an Urdu-language interview with Voice of America, emphasized that the government cannot officially place Bibi\u2019s name on the Exit Control List (ECL), thus banning her from international travel, without a conviction.\n\n\u201cUnless a person is declared guilty, there is no legal ground \u2500 how can his or her name be placed on the ECL?\u201d he asked, according to a translation by the Pakistani newspaper Dawn. \u201cThere is no question regarding this.\u201d\n\nAfridi\u2019s asserting that she must be convicted to be placed on the list suggested that extensive delays in freeing her may be ahead. The process of convicting her a first time took a year; processing her to be executed had gone on for eight years before her conviction. An appeal over the head of the Supreme Court, the court of last resort in Pakistan, would likely necessitate a significant amount of time.\n\nDuring that time, Afridi, insisted, Bibi would remain safe in prison.\n\n\u201cEvery Pakistani, regardless of his creed or religion, is the state\u2019s responsibility. No one in Pakistan can be given a license to play with someone\u2019s life or property in order to get their terms accepted,\u201d Afridi claimed.\n\nAsia Bibi remains in prison, as the government has yet to process her acquittal or the appeal promised to the TLP, which has no basis in Pakistani law.\n\n\u201cAsia Bibi is in Multan jail and has not been released yet. We have not received orders to release her so far,\u201d Zawar Hussain Warraich, minister for prisons in Punjab province, told the Agence France-Press (AFP) on Wednesday. \u201cNormally we receive orders in two days after court judgement and if relatives and lawyers of a prisoner are very active, they can bring it even within a day, but as far as Asia Bibi is concerned, it has not happened yet.\u201d\n\nBibi\u2019s husband and four children, in the meantime, have launched a global campaign seeking expedited asylum in a Western, Christian-friendly country.\n\n\u201cThere is no question that she would not be safe to live in Pakistan,\u201d Edward Clancy of the Christian international nonprofit organization Aid to the Church in Need tells Breitbart News. \u201cAs terrible as it is where she is now, she\u2019s almost safer to be in solitary confinement in prison that out in the streets.\u201d\n\nClancy notes that Aid to the Church in Need has heard from husband Ashiq Masih that the family has struggled to obtain food because leaving the house is dangerous, as Muslim neighbors have called for their deaths. He adds that the Bibi case is not unique, neither to Pakistan nor to much of the world: \u201cAsia Bibi is, in a sense, the face of thousands of others who are in similar situations all over the world.\u201d\n\nActivists and politicians in much of the West \u2013 including Canada, France, and Spain \u2013 have urged their respective countries to take Bibi in.

Yes, it is bigger than politics. Much bigger:\n\nAs the accusations crumbled under the weight of evidence and witness testimony, as Democrats moved the goalposts, as our monstrous media became desperate enough to wave around a high school yearbook like a bloody shirt, this stopped being about politics and the future of the Supreme Court and became about the fate of one man \u2014 an innocent man, a wrongfully accused man, a publicly persecuted man \u2014 which means it suddenly became the most important thing in the world. Watching Brett Kavanaugh stripped naked and publicly humiliated by the organized left and media was excruciating. The obscenity of it, the injustice. Even worse was the tightly-knotted ball of fear growing like a fascist cancer in all decent people, as we lived with the intolerable thought that this abomination might succeed, that the single most appalling act of McCarthyism of my lifetime might actually pay off.\n\nWell, thank the Lord, it did not pay off. And not only is Kavanaugh currently serving on the Supreme Court, but in a midterm election that was supposed to deliver only a wave of good news to Democrats, the American people have sent a very clear message to a political party that smeared an innocent man as a serial rapist, and did so only for partisan political purposes.\n\nAs of this writing, of all the races that have so far been called, every single Democrat in a swing state who voted against Kavanaugh has lost their Senate seat.\n\nClaire McCaskill (D-MO) lost her Senate seat by six points Tuesday night. Prior to the confirmation battle, polls showed her statistically tied.\n\nJoe Donnelly (D-IN) was leading or in a tied race pre-Kavanaugh; he lost by 9 points.\n\nHeidi Hetikamp (D-ND) was down only by single digits pre-Kavanaugh; she lost by 11 points.\n\nIn Tennessee, until the Kavanaugh smear began, Democrat Phil Bredesden was leading Republican Rep. Marsha Blackburn in a race to replace retiring Republican Sen. Bob Corker. Post-Kavanaugh, Blackburn shot into the lead and never looked back. She won by 11 points.\n\nIn two races where it is still too close to call, incumbent Senate Democrats who refused to support Kavanaugh are currently behind in the vote count.\n\nWith 100 percent of votes counted, Florida Democrat Bill Nelson is down by nearly 35,000 votes and hoping an automatic machine recount mandated by state law will save him. But unless there was a tabulating error somewhere, and a big one, Nelson is going to lose.\n\nFinally, in Montana, Democrat Jon Tester was a favorite to win by a 3 \u2013 4 point percent margin. In fact, throughout the entire race, not a single poll showed him losing. As of Wednesday morning, though, and with 86 percent of precincts reporting, he is down 0.7 percent to Republican Matt Rosendale. Tester could still pull out a win, but this is much closer than anyone anticipated.\n\nWhile he was no profile in courage throughout the confirmation process, the only Senate Democrat who ultimately voted to confirm Kavanaugh, Joe Manchin, squeaked out a 3.2 point win in West Virginia.\n\nBut as Americans, regardless of Party, regardless of politics, regardless of where you stand on Kavanaugh, we should all be thrilled at this outcome. What happened to Brett Kavanaugh was a national disgrace, is something that should never happen to anyone from either party \u2014 and in a country where our media is corrupted beyond comprehension, only the voters can delivers that message.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

Because Scruton is an unapologetic social conservative the announcement has been pounced upon by the left who have demanded his removal using \u2014 as James Delingpole reports \u2014 confected outrage and \u201coffence archaeology\u201d.\n\nThe announcement comes as continued historic levels of migration into the United Kingdom place high levels of demand on existing housing stock, which is reported to have driven up housing prices by 20 per cent. Half of all new homes built to 2022 will be filled by immigrant families, according to the government, and 90 per cent of new households formed in the past decades were immigrants.\n\nThe demand on land, particularly in the already crowded south-east of England, to build the estimated one million homes needed for Britain\u2019s growing population, is significant. With up to 67,000 acres of countryside set to be concreted over, resistance from groups like the Campaign for the Protection of Rural England and from local residents is high.\n\nConstruction is coming along nicely!

Lynch (@ConorLynchEsq) October 28, 2018\n\nThe reason why demand on housing in the United Kingdom is so high is one seldom if ever acknowledged by the government, which treats housebuilding and mass migration as unrelated subjects.\n\nA notable exception was then-housing minister Dominic Raab two months before he was shuffled to the Brexit department. Raab was widely condemned for pointing out the link because the only research available or published by the government was based on old figures.\n\nIt is against this background, with the government determined to increase the supply of housing rather than moderate or control rising demand, that the new commission will work to \u201cexplore how new settlements can be developed with greater community consent.\u201d\n\nWhile it has long been understood that the ultra-modern buildings beloved by architects themselves are generally disliked by ordinary Britons who have long shown a preference for traditional style housing, developers have resisted building in traditional styles, leading to high levels of resistance to new-build developments. By encouraging new buildings to accept local customs and styles, the government hopes to encourage \u201ccommunity consent\u201d and to create a new generation of housing that will be \u201cbuilt to last.\u201d\n\nREVEALED: Architect of Postwar Europe Was a Fascist Who Hated Jews \u2013 Breitbart http://t.co/LRvd4Cefky pic.twitter.com/sc5ljAlCJ9 \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 18, 2015\n\nAs Breitbart London reported in 2016, a rare piece of research into environmental preference by the public conducted by YouGov found that 77 per cent of people when shown pictures of modern and traditional style buildings and asked which they would rather have in their neighbourhoods preferred traditional designs. Remarkably, the results showed the responses were stable across all regions, age, and income groups, showing the broad appeal of tradition.\n\nBrokenshire explained the purpose behind the new commission when he said:\n\nMost people agree we need to build more for future generations, but too many still feel that new homes in their local area just aren\u2019t up to scratch. Part of making the housing market work for everyone is helping to ensure that what we build, is built to last. That it respects the integrity of our existing towns, villages and cities. This will become increasingly important as we look to create a number of new settlements across the country and invest in the infrastructure and technology they will need to be thriving and successful places. This commission will kick start a debate about the importance of design and style, helping develop practical ways of ensuring new developments gain the consent of communities, helping grow a sense of place, not undermine it. This will help deliver desperately needed homes \u2013 ultimately building better and beautiful will help us build more.\n\nThe Architects\u2019 Journal reports author and academic Sir Roger Scruton, who has described himself as \u201cinstinctively hostile to Modernist\u2026 horizontal slabs\u201d has been selected to lead the commission. His appointment gives the greatest indication of the direction the government will expect the commission to take, given Scruton\u2019s clear small-state views and defence of traditional building methods.\n\nGovernment Declares End of Modernist \u2018Cult of Ugliness\u2019 in Architecture https://t.co/HzKloR8JnS pic.twitter.com/EVWCk6Jr2I \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) November 4, 2016\n\nWriting in 2013, Scruton said of the challenge of trying to build new homes to meet demand when good design is not a priority: \u201cPeople resist large-scale development, because they know that it will produce an eyesore.\n\n\u201cConservative-minded architects like Leon Krier at Poundbury and John Simpson at Swindon have shown that this need not be so, that we can learn from our traditional architecture how to build in ways that enhance the neighbourhood, and in ways that produce affordable housing too.\n\n\u201cPeople protest at the faceless estates that destroy the view from their window. But no-one protests at Poundbury except the modernist architects who sense the threat that it poses to their monopoly game.\u201d\n\nScruton\u2019s appointment was immediately attacked by the left, and The Guardian newspaper took the opportunity to republish their previous claim that he resembles a narrow-minded racist because of his views on architecture.\n\nThe views of Scruton and those he champions have long been derided by the left-architectural establishment. Singled out for particular scorn has been the Prince of Wales\u2019 urban extension to Dorchester, Poundbury, which critics have called \u201cembarrassing,\u201d \u201cfake, heartless, authoritarian,\u201d and a \u201cmiddle-class ghetto.\u201d\n\nYet in 2018, 25 years after construction started on the town the British press has now acknowledged the Prince\u2019s vision of applying ancient wisdom to the modern challenges of property development and mass car ownership has borne fruit and that he \u2014 in the words of The Guardian \u2014 may have had the last laugh.\n\nIncluding many affordable homes into the scheme has prevented the attractive development from becoming the middle-class ghetto that was warned of, and the mixing of residential and commercial has meant one job per household within walking distance of home, releasing many from car dependency.\n\nBritain's great Gothic masterpiece.

The driver, a 34-year-old U.S. citizen from Long Beach, California, claimed to be a ride-share driver. The agents interviewed the four passengers in the vehicle and determined they were all Mexican nationals who were illegally present in the U.S., according to Yuma Sector officials.\n\nThe agents arrested the driver and all four of the Mexican nationals. During a biometric background investigation, the agents learned that a California court convicted one of the men in 2005 for having sex with a minor who was under the age of 16. That migrant will likely be prosecuted for aggravated illegal re-entry after removal as a sex offender.\n\nLater that evening, agents assigned to the El Centro Sector observed a man running north from the international border fence near the Calexico Port of Entry. The agents made contact with the man and learned that he had just illegally crossed the border from Mexico. The agents took the man into custody and transported him to the station for processing and a background check.\n\nCriminal database records checked by the agents revealed that the man, 30-year-old Mexican national Gildardo Gonzalez-Santiago, received a misdemeanor rape conviction in 2008 from a court in Orange County, New York, El Centro Sector officials reported. The court sentenced the Mexican man to time served (two months in jail) and required that he register as a sex offender until 2028. Following his conviction, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) officers deported the man to his home country in October 2008.\n\nGonzalez-Santiago is also expected to face new federal felony charges for illegal re-entry after removal as a sex offender, officials stated.\n\nAlso on November 3, CBP officers assigned to the Anzalduas International Bridge discovered that an Austin, Texas, man who was attempting to enter the U.S. from Reynosa, Mexico, was wanted on an active warrant for sexual assault of a child, CBP officials in the Rio Grande Valley Sector stated.\n\n46-year-old Rogelio Juarez approached the international boundary in a 2016 Chevy Silverado pickup truck. During an initial interview, officers determined the man to be a possible match to an arrest warrant from Travis County, Austin, Texas. The officer conducted a biometric background investigation and confirmed the man as the fugitive wanted by the Austin Police Department for an alleged second-degree felony charge of sexual assault of a child, officials stated.\n\nThe warrant states that Juarez is accused of sexually assaulting a 15-year-old female family member in April 2016. CBP officers turned the man over to the Mission, Texas, Police Department who will hold him pending transfer to Travis County.", "Sir Roger Scruton is England\u2019s greatest living philosopher. He also happens to be a very outspoken, articulate conservative \u2014 so it comes as no surprise whatsoever to see the left playing the faux outrage game in order to oust him from his position as a government advisor.\n\nScruton has been appointed as unpaid chairman of the UK government\u2019s Building Better, Building Beautiful housing commission. As Oliver Lane argues elsewhere, there may be reasons to be cynical about the way Britain\u2019s leading conservative thinker has been co-opted into a project which involves carpeting the British landscape with more houses. Nonetheless, as an aesthete and an intellectual with a sound grasp of architectural and social history, and a track record of campaigning, Scruton is undeniably well suited to the task of ensuring that if these buildings have to built then at least they must be attractive and of enduring quality.\n\nBut the leftist whinge brigade wants him out for no better reason than that it hungers for another Tory scalp.\n\nSo, to get rid of him, it is employing the same tactics it successfully used earlier this year to force conservative journalist and educationalist Toby Young out of his job on the board of a university watchdog. The process is known as \u201coffence archaeology\u201d (or \u201coffense archaeology\u201d if you prefer, the phrase having been invented by an American).\n\nDepressing to see the social media cops trawl through everything Roger Scruton\u2019s ever written in the hope of finding things to be offended by. As Freddie de Boer said, \u201cThat\u2019s what liberalism is now \u2013 the search for baddies doing bad things, like little offense archaeologists.\" \u2014 Toby Young (@toadmeister) November 6, 2018\n\nWhat happened to Toby Young \u2014 as he recounts here \u2014 is that, in order to destroy him, leftists went through pretty much every article and tweet he had ever written in order to find something \u201coffensive\u201d. Given that Young\u2019s schtick is being a provocative, sometimes puerile, near-the-knuckle journalist this was hardly difficult \u2014 especially for people with no qualms about ripping words out of context or feigning outrage over articles clearly written in jest or with tongue-in-cheek or simply to provoke a reaction.\n\nNow, on the Leninist principle \u2014 \u201cProbe with a bayonet: if you meet steel, stop. If you meet mush, then push\u201d \u2014 the leftists are trying it on again.\n\nAccording to BuzzFeed:\n\nShadow communities secretary Andrew Gwynne told BuzzFeed News: \u201cNobody holding those views has a place in modern democracy. The prime minister needs to finally show some leadership and sack Scruton with an investigation into how he was appointed in the first place.\u201d Liberal Democrat housing spokesperson Wera Hobhouse added: \u201cSomeone with these views has no place in advising the government on anything, and it is deeply concerning that the Conservatives have associated themselves with offensive views like this. Roger Scruton should never have been employed and the PM should ask him to resign.\u201d Labour MP Wes Streeting joined the calls for him to go, telling BuzzFeed News: \u201cWith every passing hour it becomes clear that Roger Scruton has a history of making offensive comments. It beggars belief that he passed a vetting process. This is an appalling error of judgment from the Secretary of State and the prime minister should sack him immediately and ask James Brokenshire how this appointment was ever made in the first place\u201d.\n\nSo what, pray, are these views Scruton holds that are so offensive he deserves to be sacked?\n\nWell, so far, it would appear that the best they\u2019ve got is that Scruton thinks that \u201cIslamophobia\u201d and \u201chomophobia\u201d are #fakenews; that he thinks homosexuality is not \u201cnormal\u201d; that he knows the Hungarian leader Viktor Orb\u00e1n.\n\nHere, courtesy of BuzzFeed, are some examples of Scruton being \u201coffensive\u201d:\n\nIn a 2007 article for the Telegraph, Scruton said homosexuality was not \u201cnormal\u201d and outlined his opposition to gay adoption. \u201cEvery now and then,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwe wake up to the fact that, although homosexuality has been normalised, it is not normal. Our acceptance of the homosexual lifestyle, of same-sex couples, and of the gay scene has not eliminated our sense that these are alternatives to something, and that it is the other thing that is normal.\u201d On gay adoption, Scruton wrote: \u201cIt is no more an act of discrimination to exclude gay couples than it is to exclude incestuous liaisons or communes of promiscuous swingers.\u201d He added: \u201cWe are being asked to overlook all that we know about the fragility of homosexual partnerships, about the psychological needs of children, and about the norms that still prevail in our schools and communities, for the sake of an ideological fantasy.\u201d Scruton returned to the theme of Islamophobia in an article for the Spectator in March 2016. He wrote that those who criticise Islam \u201chave to put up with every kind of nasty label \u2014 racist, fascist, sexist, and whatever imagined \u2018phobia\u2019 serves the agenda of the day \u2014 and will be hard pushed to hold on to a job as a policeman, a teacher, or a government official\u201d. He added: \u201cIt is this fear in response to fear that is now leading the authorities all across Europe to hide the truth about the sexual crimes of Muslim immigrants.\u201d\n\nWell yes, perhaps from the point of view of an SJW milquetoast, these are naughty, reactionary, hurty words.\n\nBut they also happen to be words with which the majority of the British population likely agree.\n\nWhat we have here, then, is another classic example of what Vox Day calls SJW \u201cpoint and shriek\u201d tactics, whereby a shrill, fascistic minority feign noisy outrage in order to bully the majority into acting against its own interests.\n\nIf the government caves in on Scruton as, quite inexcusably and pusillanimously it did with Toby Young, then the left will be encouraged to use these noisome tactics again and again. And every government advisory body in the land will be composed of achingly right-on, career-safe, liberal leftists with opinions not remotely representative of where the people of Britain really stand.\n\nScruton, as Guido notes here in this handsome tribute, is a hero \u2014 with strong claims to the title of Greatest Living Englishman.\n\nAnd if you\u2019ve any doubts as to why he\u2019s so great, listen to his magnificent wisdom in this podcast we recorded last year.\n\nIf the government throws Scruton to the wolves, it will be a huge triumphant for the forces of the left and a terrible loss for the nation.", "Republicans gained Senate seats on Wednesday in Indiana, Missouri, and North Dakota as American rejected gun control again.\n\nSen.

While on the surface healthcare can often be a political issue, in reality, people on both sides of the political spectrum are reaching for the same thing, although often in very different ways. What people on both sides want is an affordable way to get quality healthcare for themselves and their families.\n\nBoth Republicans and Democrats have worked, in their own ways, to lower the price of healthcare and make it accessible to more people. Despite these efforts, the cost of healthcare in the United States continues to rise. While Republicans and Democrats may disagree on the best solution to the critical issue, one thing is clear to supporters of both parties: Costs are too high.\n\nInsurance companies try to convince Americans that they can live without worrying about how they\u2019ll pay for their medical bills . However, if you\u2019ve ever been in one of these programs, you know that when you get sick or injured, you have to worry not only about the care you need, but also how you\u2019re going to pay for it. Whether it\u2019s high out-of-pocket expenses or the company not paying for the care you need, often the consumer is stuck footing the bill, despite the high monthly payments they make.\n\nRegardless of which party had taken control of Congress following the Midterm Elections, we are almost guaranteed to see the healthcare issue take center stage in the coming months and years. As we know from experience with this issue, and just based on how government operates in our country, the fight to improve Americans\u2019 healthcare is one that may take years to complete if it ever gets done at all.\n\nIf you\u2019re like most Americans who simply can\u2019t afford to sit idly by while Congress fights back and forth, maybe it\u2019s time to consider a different way. One method of paying for healthcare that many Americans have found to be quite advantageous is known as healthcare sharing . This method can be an affordable way to pay for healthcare while also putting them back in control of their healthcare. Healthcare sharing allows members to choose the doctor they want to see, not a doctor they are required to see. Healthcare sharing is also focusing on keeping costs down for their members, while also ensuring that members know where their money is going.\n\nOne healthcare sharing organization that is currently helping more than 250,000 members nationwide, from all political parties, is Liberty HealthShare . As a non-profit organization, Liberty HealthShare is focused not on increasing profits, but rather on keeping costs down for their members. This allows them to offer programs for as low as $199 per month for individuals and $529 for an entire family, which are hard prices to beat when searching for a way to pay for your healthcare.\n\nThanks to an exemption written into the Affordable Care Act, healthcare sharing organizations such as Liberty HealthShare are not bound by regulations placed upon programs offered on the Exchange. Along those lines, programs offered by Liberty HealthShare have no provider networks, meaning members can choose to visit any doctor or hospital they feel is the best fit for them. This is just one of the ways healthcare sharing organizations return freedom to the consumers and could loom large depending on how the new, incoming Congress decides to handle the healthcare issue.", "Italian interior minister Matteo Salvini tweeted out felicitations to President Donald Trump Wednesday, congratulating him for the results of U.S. midterm elections.\n\n\u201cCongratulations to President Trump for the seats taken in the Senate and confirmation in crucial states, against everything and everyone: lefty journalists, actors and singers, directors and pseudo-intellectuals. #godonaldgo,\u201d Salvini wrote.\n\nComplimenti al presidente #Trump per i seggi conquistati al Senato e la conferma in Stati cruciali, contro tutto e contro tutti: giornalisti di sinistra, attori e cantanti, registi e pseudo-intellettuali\u2026 #godonaldgo@realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/5g0mad4Fzj \u2014 Matteo Salvini (@matteosalvinimi) November 7, 2018\n\nNot long afterward, Salvini had the chance to tweet congratulations to himself on an Italian senate victory for the passage Wednesday of his \u201cSalvini decree\u201d on security and immigration, three-part legislation addressing (1) asylum and citizenship, (2) security measures against organized crime, and (3) the administration of good confiscated from the mafia.\n\nThe populist Salvini called the triumph a \u201chistoric day\u201d for Italy.\n\nDecreto Sicurezza e Immigrazione, ore 12.19, il Senato approva!!!#DecretoSalvini, giornata storica! pic.twitter.com/7xXsVampPY \u2014 Matteo Salvini (@matteosalvinimi) November 7, 2018\n\nEarly in the 2016 U.S. election campaign, Salvini met with Donald Trump in Pennsylvania, where they reportedly discussed the economy and Europe\u2019s migrant crisis.\n\nDuring the rally in Wilkes-Barre, Salvini was holding a \u201cTrump: Make America Great Again\u201d poster and afterward had a 20-minute meeting with the Republican presidential front-runner.\n\nAs Salvini assured Trump of his support for victory November 8, Mr. Trump reciprocated the campaign well-wishes, declaring, \u201cMatteo, I hope you become Prime Minister soon.\u201d\n\nSalvini has since said he is a Trump supporter all the way. \u201cHis rigor, his strategy for economic recovery, his security policies, all make me root for Trump,\u201d he said.\n\nFollow Thomas D.

What? Is this some kind of sick joke??\n\nI think we can all agree that it wasn\u2019t a nice thing to do, making light of the awful conflagration in a London apartment block last year that caused the death of 72 people. But since when was not being nice an arrestable offence?\n\nBrendan O\u2019Neill asks much the same question in a characteristically trenchant essay headlined \u201cIs it now a crime to be a twat?\u201d\n\nI cannot be the only person who finds the Metropolitan Police\u2019s promise to investigate the Grenfell Tower bonfire video more chilling than the video itself. Yes, the video is repulsive. But what crime has been committed here? Being a wanker? Being a scumbag? Saying disgusting things in your own back garden? Those are criminal offences now? If they are, then Britain has far greater things to worry about than the fact that a handful of dreadful people decided to burn an effigy of Grenfell Tower for Bonfire Night. First things first: the video is horrible. I am going to make a wild guess that the people featured in it, laughing and cheering as their cardboard Grenfell Tower goes up in flames, are not very nice. Some of them are probably racist. In the windows of their Grenfell effigy, there are notably non-white paper figures, waving for help. The effigy-burners say \u2018This is what you get for not paying your rent!\u2019 as the paper figures are consumed by the bonfire flames. Gross. But criminal? That would be even more gross. Living in a society that criminalises people for what they say in their own back gardens would be worse, infinitely worse, than living in a society that has small numbers of prejudiced twats who think mocking the Grenfell calamity is funny.\n\nYes. But I think there\u2019s a couple of points he\u2019s missing here in his eagerness to signal just how reprehensible he finds the men\u2019s behaviour.\n\nOne is that sick jokes, very sick jokes, have long been part of our culture. You could argue, as Brendan seems determined to do, that the people who engage in such humour are a warped minority entirely unrepresentative of the British populace at large. But I suspect the truth is that very tasteless jokes of one sort or another are actually pretty common among a large cross-section of UK society, from squaddies and working class lads to City traders and toffs.\n\nCertainly, back in the day, I remember that within about 24 hours of a news horror story breaking \u2014 be it the murder of Lord Mountbatten by the INLA or the Challenger space shuttle disaster or 9/11 \u2014 the first sick reaction jokes would start doing the rounds. These jokes were exchanged among men \u2014 rarely among women, who tend not to see the funny side at all \u2014 as a kind of social currency, to show how in the loop you were.\n\nToday much the same function is served by memes: the sooner you\u2019ve seen them, the cooler it means you are. Beyond that, I think sick jokes have always been the way that as a culture, men especially, we process tragedy.\n\nMany of the old boys I met who fought in World War II told me how they used to josh around with corpses \u2014 posing for photographs shaking their hands, shoving cigarettes in their mouths and so on. In today\u2019s hysterical offence-taking climate this behaviour would no doubt be condemned as disrespectful. But it\u2019s more complicated than that. It\u2019s about using black humour as a form of insulation against the horror of death.\n\nThe other key point is a political one. Scarcely had the last smouldering embers of the Grenfell conflagration been extinguished when the whole tragedy was seized by the left and used as a stick with which to beat all its favourite targets: rich people, white people, Tories.\n\nLike the death of Diana, it became a litmus test for how in tune you were with the national mood of collective hysteria: if you didn\u2019t think it was the worse thing ever, if you weren\u2019t out there on the streets laying flowers or raising funds or \u2014 in the case of the Duchess of Sussex, launching a cookbook \u2014 for the victims, if you didn\u2019t hate Theresa May for showing insufficient emotion on her visit to the site, then basically you were heartless scum.\n\nSo many Corbynistas and race-baiting activists have made political mileage out of Grenfell, so many con-artists have ripped off the compensation system, so preferential has been the treatment afforded the survivors (given superior housing as a kind of emotional Danegeld to buy off all those shrill, angry leftist campaigners determined to milk every last drop out of the tragedy) that Grenfell has become a kind of emblem for almost everything at least one half of the country fears about how Britain would look if ever Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s hard left lunatics got into power.\n\nYou may say those men\u2019s bonfire gesture was vile, tasteless and disrespectful \u2014 and I would agree. But I\u2019ll bet you anything you like it that would never even have occurred to them to make such a gesture if the Grenfell Tower tragedy hadn\u2019t been rammed down their throats, day in day out, for nigh on a year by shyster, race-baiting politicians like David Lammy and by leftist media organisations like the BBC.\n\nStill, the bottom line \u2014 as O\u2019Neill rightly says \u2014 is that Britain is now ruled by virtue-signalling twonks who, in their eagerness to appease the Guardianista chattering classes, have long since abandoned all sense of justice or proportion.\n\nThe fury over the Grenfell Tower video has been grimly fascinating. It has confirmed that virtue-signalling has now crossed the line from being the irritating pastime of time-rich tweeters keen to advertise their PC probity and has become an actual menace to the free society. Following an orgy of signalled virtue over this video, which included not just the usual suspects but also Theresa May, Sajid Javid, Diane Abbott and various police chiefs, the police clearly felt they had no choice but to investigate this back-garden idiocy.

Support for Israel is now a Republican issue \u2014 and opposition to Israel a Democratic one.\n\nThat trend began when the far-left wrongly blamed Jews in the George W. Bush administration \u2014 the \u201cIsrael lobby\u201d \u2014 for the Iraq War. It accelerated when President Barack Obama, who had long associated with anti-Israel figures, chose to create \u201cdistance\u201d between the U.S. and Israel, including the Iran nuclear deal.\n\nAnd with the midterm election results on Tuesday night, the transformation of the Israel issue was complete. The Democrats will be bringing several new anti-Israel representatives to the U.S. House, including:\n\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez (NY-14), who sided with the terrorist group Hamas when it sent \u201cprotesters\u201d to storm the Israeli border, and who said she opposed the \u201coccupation of Palestine\u201d but could not define it;\n\nRashida Tlaib (MI-13), a radical leftist who has called for the destruction of Israel as a separate state, causing even the left-wing J Street organization to withdraw its endorsement of her candidacy;\n\nIlhan Omar (MN-5), who has referred to Israel as an \u201capartheid regime,\u201d and who once tweeted: \u201cIsrael has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel\u201d;\n\nRepublicans suffered the defeat of several pro-Israel Republicans, including Rep. John Faso (R-NY) and Rep. Peter Roskam (R-IL), chair of the House Republican Israel Caucus. Both lost to Democrats who are critical of Israel.\n\nHowever, pro-Israel Republicans also won several key races.\n\nForemost among these were the race for governor in Florida, where Rep. Ron DeSantis (R-FL), one of the most pro-Israel members of Congress, defeated Democrat Andrew Gillum, who is closely tied to an anti-Israel organization. Republicans also celebrated the re-election of Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), a champion of the U.S.-Israel alliance.\n\nIn addition, Republicans won Tuesday in races that had been targeted by the Republican Jewish Coalition (RJC) because the Democratic candidates had explicit anti-Israel records.\n\nIn Virginia\u2019s 5th district, Democrat Leslie Cockburn had literally written an entire book bashing Israel. The RJC launched an ad attacking her record, helping Republican Denver Riggleman win a closely watched district.\n\nIn Pennsylvania\u2019s 1st district, the RJC launched an ad against Democrat Scott Wallace, whose family foundation had supported anti-Israel groups, and who infamously used the \u201cf-word\u201d in a debate held in a local synagogue.\n\nUpdate: Republicans also held on in California\u2019s 50th congressional district, where pro-Israel Rep. Duncan Hunter overcame a federal indictment to defeat Democrat Ammar Campa-Najjar, the grandson of a Palestinian terrorist.\n\nThough Israel was not a major nationwide issue in the election, not one Democrat attended the opening of the new U.S. embassy in Jerusalem. Both DeSantis and Cruz were personally on hand in May for the embassy opening, as were other Republican members of Congress.\n\nThough there are still Democratic voters who support Israel \u2014 and support for Israel among all Americans remains very high \u2014 the party\u2019s elected leaders have chosen the other side.\n\nJoel B.

Todd Rokita (R-IN) and Luke Messer (R-IN), during the state\u2019s Senate Republican primary in May by tapping into Trump\u2019s anti-establishment program.\n\n\u201cThis fall, we\u2019re going to send a message to Senator Donnelly and the rest of Washington that politics shouldn\u2019t be a career and if we want to change things we need to change the people we send there,\u201d Braun said when he won the Indiana Senate Republican primary.\n\nDonnelly faced an increasingly competitive Senate race over the last several months and tried for most of the race to paint himself as a bipartisan who often avoided his own party affiliation.\n\nOn Sunday, former President Barack Obama campaigned for Donnelly in Gary, Indiana, which represented a stark contrast from an NPR interview in June in which the Indiana senator stressed he was a bipartisan lawmaker representing Hoosier interests in the Senate.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not trying to tie myself to one label or another label. My label is a Hoosier label. My label as an American label,\u201d Donnelly told NPR. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what we all should be doing.\u201d\n\nFurther, Donnelly chastised the far-left wing of his party, slamming the \u201csocialists\u201d who would want to abolish the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency and those who would want to establish a government-run socialized medicine scheme, otherwise known as \u201cMedicare for All.\u201d\n\nDonnelly\u2019s criticism of government-run health care contrasts with Obama, who embraced the socialized healthcare scheme as a \u201cgood new idea\u201d during a speech in September.\n\nDespite Donnelly labeling himself as a bipartisan lawmaker who represents Hoosier interests, Donnelly voted against confirming Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, even though a plurality of voters wanted Kavanaugh confirmed to the Supreme Court.\n\nBraun exposed Donnelly\u2019s \u201cultimate level of hypocrisy\u201d for criticizing Braun\u2019s Hoosier business, while Donnelly\u2019s family business has outsourced Indiana jobs to Mexico. Donnelly first railed against free trade when he first ran for the House in 2004, slamming the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and called outsourcing, \u201ca fancy term for \u2018Someone in Indiana that has just lost their job.\u2019\u201d\n\nBraun has paralleled himself with the president, touting his business background and anti-establishment campaign.\n\nBraun said, \u201cI have a business background, and we get things fixed with hard decisions when you need to, put up some short-term pains for long-term gains and prosperity that comes with good decision making.\u201d", "Join Breitbart News and SiriusXM Patriot Tuesday night for a special Election Night 2018 live stream.\n\nBreitbart News Editor in Chief Alex Marlow will deliver real-time election results and commentary alongside co-hosts Andrew Wilcow of the Wilcow Majority and David Webb of the David Webb Show.

Maria Elvira Salazar (R-FL), turning Florida\u2019s 27th congressional district blue, according to NBC News.\n\nShalala will succeed longtime Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL) in a demographically diverse district, which includes Miami Beach and Coral Gables. \u201cClose to 60 percent of registered voters in the district are Latino, and the majority are Cuban-American,\u201d NBC News reports.\n\nShalala faced a field of four other candidates in the district\u2019s Democrat primary, including a state lawmaker who has been gaining on her in the fundraising chase but who lacked her name recognition. Asked why she chose to take this fresh path after such a long career, Shalala said: \u201cWhat I decided in my mind was that I wasn\u2019t finished with public service. I wanted to take a shot.\u201d\n\nShalala, former president of both the University of Miami and the University of Wisconsin, banked on her experience to win voters over. While her Democratic rivals took similar positions on most key issues \u2014 tackling climate change, reducing gun violence, improving health care, overhauling immigration \u2014 none of the others could match Shalala\u2019s lengthy record or familiar name. She also served as President Bill Clinton\u2019s Health and Human Services secretary for eight years.\n\n\u201cOur theme is basically, ready on day one,\u201d she said in a recent interview. \u201cThat sends a message to them as well.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "Democrat Jennifer Wexton is projected to defeat Rep. Barbara Comstock (R-VA) in Virginia\u2019s 10th congressional district, according to NBC News.\n\nWexton, a state senator, is ahead of Comstock 57.9 percent to 42.1 percent with 56 percent of the votes counted.\n\nThe race was one of the most closely watched in the country, because Comstock had been considered one of the most vulnerable incumbents in the country. Comstock won the northern Virginia district in 2016 with 53 percent of the vote, but at the presidential level, Democrat Hillary Clinton carried the district by 10 points. Last year, Democrat Ralph Northam carried the district by 13 points in Virginia\u2019s gubernatorial election.\n\nAs a result, lots of Democrats filed to take on Comstock. Six will be on the ballot, and four of the six had raised more than $850,000, according to Federal Election Commission reports.\n\nWexton received the endorsement of Gov. Northam and had emphasized her experience as a prosecutor and as the only elected official in the race.\n\n\u201cMost people I talk to do not believe the U.S. Congress should be an entry-level position,\u201d Wexton said in a recent interview.\n\nPreviously, Wexton made no apologies for being willing to compromise and work with Republicans even if it means settling for less than you\u2019d prefer.\n\nShe said primary voters \u201cwant someone who\u2019s going to stand up to divisive politics from the other side, but they still want someone who will work with the other side and is not going to vilify the other side.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "The Chinese Communist Party regulatory body that controls the nation\u2019s karaoke venues announced a ban on 6,000 songs this week, claiming the Chinese businesses were not paying the original artists for their work.\n\nThe songs banned include some of China\u2019s most popular, causing controversy on the Chinese social network Weibo, including songs by artists in Taiwan and Hong Kong, whose young people have become increasingly vocal in their quest for self-governance.\n\nChina will reportedly continue to allow the songs to play on airwaves but only if the artists are properly compensated. In the past, the Chinese regime has banned thousands of songs at once from the airwaves for not properly conveying \u201csocialist core values.\u201d\n\nThe South China Morning Post reported on Tuesday that the ban on the latest round of 6,000 songs will take effect in venues that use KTV, which it defines as \u201cChina\u2019s popular karaoke culture.\u201d\n\n\u201cKTVs and their video on demand service providers were ordered by the state-sponsored China Audio-Video Copyright Association (CAVCA) to remove 6,609 songs by artists from China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and South Korea by October 31,\u201d the Post explained, adding that some songs will continue to be allowed to exist on these servers but not the versions existing in the system, which are protected by copyright.\n\nThe CAVCA songs banned include artists such as A-Mei and Jay Chou of Taiwan.\n\nSites translating social media content in China, like the outlet What\u2019s on Weibo, reported that users \u201cfear that KTV nights won\u2019t be as fun anymore\u201d with such a significant number of songs no longer available.\n\n\u201cThe public response to the KTV songs copyright takedown is two-sided: there are those who oppose to the measure for negatively impacting the karaoke business and customers\u2019 options \u2026 and then there are those who express their support for better copyright protection in China,\u201d the site claimed.\n\nThe Chinese Communist government has traditionally had very little regard for intellectual property or individual ownership of copyright. Consistent efforts to steal intellectual property from the United States have made prominent headlines this year, damaging Beijing\u2019s reputation in the face of potential foreign investors. On technology issues, Chinese officials appear little interested in arguing that China is a safe place for scientific innovation; an article in September\u2019s Global Times proclaimed, \u201cscience belongs to all human beings.\u201d\n\nOn issues outside of technology, however, the government recently indicated more interest in protecting foreign companies when the potential exists to limit Chinese people\u2019s exposure to foreign culture. For example, on Tuesday, the Guangzhou Yuexiu District Court issued a landmark ruling protecting the Danish company Lego from widespread copyright violations in the form of Chinese manufacturers imitating their trademark toy blocks. The ruling awarded Lego $649,735 in damages.\n\nChina has greatly heightened its surveillance and tracking of music releases in particular under Communist Party chief Xi Jinping. In 2015, the Ministry of Culture released a list of 120 \u201cbanned\u201d songs, warning that anyone caught listening to them would face \u201csevere punishment.\u201d Many were rap songs discussing drug and alcohol use but also included on the list were songs by Taiwanese musicians, including one that jokingly praised Taiwanese women as being superior to Chinese women.\n\nFollowing that crackdown, Xi\u2019s government attempted to popularize communist rap, releasing songs with titles like \u201cMarx is a Millennial\u201d and \u201cThe Reform Group Is Two Years Old.\u201d The campaign largely failed to generate interest in government-sponsored hip-hop, a reality made stark by the popularity of the reality show The Rap of China, a breakthrough program broadcast on summer 2017.\n\nThe Rap of China triggered a government backlash in January in which media censors announced a ban on rap music on broadcast television, calling it \u201cimmoral and vulgar content.\u201d Television networks were warned to not \u201cuse celebrities with low moral values; do not use those who are vulgar and of low taste; do not use those whose thoughts and style are not refined; and do not use those who are involved in scandals.\u201d\n\nBoth winners of The Rap of China, PG One and Gai, suffered government retribution as their popularity surged, as well as other featured rappers on the program. The company iQiyi, which initially produced the program, launched a second season of the reality TV show this summer airing online to avoid the ban on television.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Ajit Pai took aim at telecommunications companies on Monday, demanding action to thwart excessive automated phone calls.\n\nPai is following up on an FCC letter sent to 13 companies in May, asking them to develop a \u201ccall authentication system\u201d to prevent the use of \u201cspoof\u201d numbers used by spammers.

Many of those companies do not \u201chave concrete plans to implement a robust call authentication framework,\u201d according to FCC staff.\n\nThe framework is designed to \u201cdigitally validate the handoff of phone calls passing through the complex web of networks,\u201d the FCC explained, \u201callowing the phone company of the consumer receiving the call to verify that a call is from the person supposedly making it.\u201d\n\nAccording to Reuters, \u201cYouMail, a company that blocks robocalls and tracks them, estimated there were 5.1 billion unwanted calls last month, up from 3.4 billon in April.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need call authentication to become a reality \u2014 it\u2019s the best way to ensure that consumers can answer their phones with confidence.
