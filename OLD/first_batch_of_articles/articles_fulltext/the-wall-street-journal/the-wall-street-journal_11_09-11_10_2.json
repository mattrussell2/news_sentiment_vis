Owl Trail near Muir Beach is one of his favorite local runs. Photo: Ramin Rahimian for The Wall Street Journal\n\nWhile most seniors battle arthritic joints and low back pain, Eric Spector is combating blistered feet and missing toenails. At 71 years old, his idea of a short race isn\u2019t a 5K, but a 50K.\n\nMr. Spector completed his first ultramarathon, any race greater in distance than a marathon or 26.2 miles, when he was 60, an age when most people think they should be slowing down. He has since completed nearly 20 ultradistance races, some as long as 100 miles.\n\nMr. Spector says he got hooked on distance after completing his first New York City Marathon in 1979. When he moved from Manhattan to Marin County, Calif., in 1988, he discovered trail running and has rarely pounded pavement since.\n\nIntrigued by the idea of running farther than a marathon, he showed up for a 50K at age 60 without training. \u201cI paid for my lack of preparation, but made it to the end,\u201d he says. \u201cIgnorant grit can get you through a 50K but I knew if I wanted to run 100 miles, it was a whole other ballgame.\u201d\n\nTrail running comes with hazards. In his mid-60s, distracted by an ocean view, he face-planted over a rock and fractured his fibula. While healing, he re-evaluated is goals. \u201cWith ultras, especially at my age, it isn\u2019t about grinding through miles or going fast,\u201d he says. \u201cMy goal is to avoid injuries from falling and overuse.\u201d\n\nMr. Spector lives in Palo Alto, Calif., and is semiretired. Until 2014, he worked as CEO of OneRoof, Inc., a social enterprise that opened internet centers in rural Mexico and India. He still consults pro bono for nonprofits and startups. He jokes that he often wins his age group by default. \u201cThere aren\u2019t many 70-year-olds doing this,\u201d he says. But every race is a challenge. During the 2016 Javelina Jundred 100 in Fountain Hills, Ariz., he quit at mile 91 due to heat and cramping. And at the 2017 Miwok 100K in Marin County, he took a spill at mile 55. \u201cIt cost me a critical 5 minutes awkwardly extracting myself from a bramble of bushes,\u201d he says.\n\nOn November 3, he completed the Rio Del Lago 100-mile trail run in the Sierra Foothills in a time of 29:15:43, winning the 70+ age group. The course has 13,500 feet of elevation gain and 29% of the 354 racers who started didn\u2019t finish.\n\nThe Workout\n\nMr. Spector warms up with a foam roller, then performs bicycle crunches and squats with a stability ball between his back and a wall. He says balance and ankle strength are key for trail running. In one exercise, he mimics a runner\u2019s stride and balances on his left leg, rising up to his toes, and brings his right knee into his chest and then switches legs. He builds ankle strength by standing one foot on a small balance board and rolling the board at different angles.\n\nDepending on what he is training for, he typically does a long run of 15 to 20 miles once a week, a moderate run of 10 to 15 miles twice a week and an easy run of 5 to 7 miles at least twice a week. He always gives himself a recovery day after the long run and between the moderate runs. Mr. Spector says he pays more attention to time spent on his feet versus his pace. Leading up to the Rio Del Lago run, he logged a 31-miler, which took 11 hours to complete.\n\nTo train for elevation, he integrates power walking into his training. \u201cIf I push off my thighs with my hands as I take each step, I can almost go as fast as I would if I were to run up the steep parts,\u201d he says.\n\nHe goes to a gym in San Rafael, Calif., two days a week. He might swim for an hour and then use weight machines to work his core and upper body. One day a week, he joins a group workout focused on strength and flexibility which might include plank poses, exercises on the rings, and kettlebell drills. \u201cSometimes I\u2019m running with 7 pounds of water and food on my back and in my hands,\u201d he says. \u201cI have to have a strong core or I\u2019d feel it in my back.\u201d\n\nOn Nov. 3, Mr. Spector completed the Rio Del Lago 100-mile trail run in the Sierra Foothills in a time of 29:15:43, winning the 70+ age group and finishing 213 out of 354 racers. Photo: Facchino Photography\n\nThe Diet\n\nBreakfast is typically coffee and nonfat yogurt or nonfat cottage cheese, topped with berries and sprouted sunflower seeds. He avoids meat. Wild-caught fish, salads and healthy fats like avocado and nuts comprise lunch and dinner. \u201cMy long runs are an excuse to indulge my bad food habits,\u201d he jokes. He carb-loads with pasta, bread, cookies and cheese, and will have a Guinness after his weekly group runs. During an ultrarace, he tries to consume an energy gel every 20 minutes and drink 30 ounces of water per hour. He grazes on Fig Newtons, peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, and boiled salted potatoes at aid stations.\n\nMr. Spector, left, says he got hooked on distance after running his first New York City Marathon in 1979. Photo: New York Road Runners\n\nThe Gear & Cost\n\nMr. Spector goes through a pair of sneakers every five to six weeks. He looks for a model with \u201cgood cushion and lots of tread to grip rocks and loose sand.\u201d He\u2019s currently running in Hoka One One Stinson ATR 4 trail shoes ($160). He\u2019s obsessive about socks. \u201cThe fit can\u2019t be too tight and I need a wool blend so if my feet get wet they don\u2019t get cold,\u201d he says. He wears a Nathan VaporKrar 4-liter hydration vest ($150). He uses a Garmin Forerunner 935 watch ($500) to track his metrics and sets an alarm on an old Timex Ironman watch to remind him to take electrolytes. Group strength sessions at Buddha and the Thinker fitness studio cost $25.\n\nThe Playlist\n\n\u201cI appreciate the sounds and beauty of nature,\u201d he says. \u201cOn a recent evening solo run I got to enjoy a truly awesome sunset, a beautiful sliver of a moon peeking out through clouds, and an almost overwhelming orchestra of crickets.\u201d\n\nQuality Over Quantity Most people think they should do less as they age, which means fewer miles for runners. But it is the quality of those miles that matter, says David Roche, coach of the Some Work, All Play running team in Boulder, Colo. \u201cThe body doesn\u2019t know miles, it knows stress,\u201d he says. \u201cAging athletes need to think in terms of how much stress they are accumulating with training and life. Ten miles on gently rolling, soft trails is less stress than 10 miles of pavement pounding. The usual rule for aging runners is to focus on frequency of runs over duration of runs, ideally supplemented by cross-training.\u201d A 2016 study done by Harvard Medical School and the National Running Center at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital showed that athletes can reduce the amount of impact forces their bodies absorb over time by focusing on a light footfall. \u201cEmphasizing softer, quicker strides could reduce injury risk, and it will likely make you more efficient on the trails,\u201d says Mr. Roche. With all the roots, rocks and undulations on the trails, runners will typically have a slower pace and a faster cadence, improving a runner\u2019s foot fall, says Rich Airey, a Leadville, Colo.-based ultra runner and owner of BlackSheep Endurance. \u201cFaster cadence leads to a shorter stride length, allowing the foot to fall under the hips, taking the stress off the knees and ankles,\u201d he says. Strength training is key as we age, he adds. \u201cThe more you run, the more you\u2019re breaking down your muscle fibers so movements like squats, lunges, step ups, and dead lifts will help to strengthen the legs and minimize muscle breakdown,\u201d he says.\n\nWhat\u2019s your workout?

Both produced ready-to-wear of the highest possible workmanship; in fact, the work of Galanos was not only on par with the Paris couture, its finish was sometimes finer. But where Norell\u2019s designs were architecturally accessible, a piece by Galanos was often mysteriously complex. And while Norell now and then nodded to Chanel and Balenciaga, Galanos ignored Paris completely. After Norell died in 1972, the brilliant Geoffrey Beene moved into the top tier with Galanos, who remained stratospheric in his Los Angeles laboratory of luxe, dressing very rich women, Hollywood royalty and First Lady Nancy Reagan until his retirement in 1998. In recent museum roundups of late-20th-century fashion Norell and Beene are almost always present, while Galanos seems to have gone missing.\n\nJames Galanos: Design Integrity Leonard Pearlstein Gallery at Drexel University\n\nThrough Dec. 21 and Jan. 8-27, 2019\n\n\u201cJames Galanos: Design Integrity,\u201d on view in the Leonard Pearlstein Gallery at Drexel University, doesn\u2019t answer the question of why Galanos is underrepresented, though in the New York-centric fashion world, designers on the West Coast have tended to be out-of-sight-out-of-mind. Instead, the exhibition establishes a baseline for his importance. In 2016, before Galanos died that year at 92, the university\u2019s Robert and Penny Fox Historic Costume Collection (FHCC) received over 700 couture-level ensembles\u2014plus thousands of sketches, swatches, and photographs\u2014from the James G. Galanos Foundation. This major and enviable gift now forms the James G. Galanos Archive at Drexel University, and this exhibition is the first outing of pieces pulled from the Archive, a prelude to more Galanos exhibitions to come.\n\nOrganized by Clare Sauro, FHCC director and chief curator, with Cara Fry and Monica Stevens Smyth, the show contains approximately 60 pieces, the oldest dating to 1953, two years after Galanos launched his own house at the tender age of 27. Born in 1924 in Philadelphia, the son of Greek immigrants, Galanos was in a hurry to succeed and left each phase of his training\u2014education at New York\u2019s Traphagen School of Fashion, stints designing at Hattie Carnegie, the Paris house of Piguet, and Davidow in New York\u2014prematurely because he felt stifled by the formulas of others. He headed west to be a sketch artist at Columbia Pictures, where his talent impressed Jean Louis, its chief designer, who lent him $200 to produce his first collection. The label read \u201cGalanos Originals.\u201d\n\nAfternoon dress, silk warp-printed taffeta (winter 1957-58) and wool cocktail dress (c. 1953) Photo: The James G. Galanos Archive at Drexel University\n\nHe took that label literally. \u201cI\u2019m always trying to invent a seam that is intricate, intelligent, but that works,\u201d Galanos is quoted in wall text. The first three garments in the exhibition\u2019s introductory section, however, do show outside influences. Two shirtwaist silhouettes from 1953 and winter 1957-58 echo Christian Dior\u2019s \u201cNew Look,\u201d while a beaded sheath from fall 1957 recalls the sequined mermaid dresses of Norell. But already there are twists. The 1957-58 shirtwaist of shot-silk\u2014bronze roses on black\u2014has a tight bodice that buttons up like a bishop\u2019s soutane and a skirt that flares out from a crow\u2019s murder of small tucks. Its severity is bold, its dark bloom powerful. And Galanos\u2019s mermaid, beaded with the sassy pattern of an argyle sock, is better than sexy\u2014it\u2019s witty. By the 1960s Galanos is flying free.\n\nThe exhibition continues through four sections that address the themes of black, drape, tailoring, and textiles. Galanos excelled in each of these, and displayed a special mastery over silk chiffon, a fabric of unruly softness that disses all but the most precise designers. Precision is everywhere on view, from the simple jewel necklines that curve like celestial rings around the throat, to long sleeves that narrow into perfect pools at the wrists (tiny invisible zippers allow the hand through). A high-belted cinnamon wool suit (winter 1958-59); a tiered gown in nutmeg and claret wool jersey (fall 1984); and a Bakst-like paisley lam\u00e9 aflame in orange, purple, and gold, yoked with red bugle beads (1990), all suggest a continuing affinity with the 1910s\u2014Suffragette suits, Paul Poiret, and the Ballets Russes\u2014a decade of particularly imaginative shape-making.\n\nGalanos sketch (c. 1985) Photo: The James G. Galanos Archive at Drexel University\n\nBut no one shape says \u201cGalanos,\u201d which may be another reason this designer hasn\u2019t emerged in high historical relief. His innovations were often hidden within the dress, in sly cut and imperceptible, airtight construction. For this reason one wishes the exhibition had provided more information in its overly-spare labeling\u2014some history about the pieces, some explication of, and insight into, those \u201cintricate, intelligent\u201d Galanos seams.\n\nPortrait of James Galanos (c. 1955) Photo: The James G. Galanos Archive at Drexel University\n\nWhat jumps at the viewer is the joie de vivre of this man\u2019s textile choices and color combinations. Galanos took the most scrumptious silks, wools, and velvets Europe had to offer and brought opposites\u2014hard and soft, tight weave and loose, glitter and matte\u2014into connubial bliss. If one piece speaks for this designer, I think it would be the forest-green evening ensemble of fall 1991, \u201cchine taffeta with lace with lurex and chenille embellishment.\u201d This short taffeta tunic and matching train, floor-length like a peacock\u2019s tail, is paired with deep-green lace leggings\u2014lace leggings!\u2014which match the tunic\u2019s lace sleeves! Is this the undine M\u00e9lisande emerging from the woods? Or a red-carpet concoction for a screen siren?

When Jerry got wet or got something stuck on him, he would twist his spine and shake his entire body at the astonishing rate of four times a second, as I discovered by taking high-speed footage of him. A clothes dryer would take 20 minutes to get rid of as much water as he managed to remove in a few quick shakes.\n\nAs a mechanical engineer and biologist, this set me thinking: What if I could design a machine that moves as effectively, flexibly and adaptively as Jerry\u2019s spine? And what lessons might we be able to draw from the extraordinary physiology of other animals?\n\nFor millions of years, as animals have evolved to take myriad shapes and forms, they have adapted to solve a variety of physical challenges. Many have overcome obstacles that humans face as well. With the rise of new technologies to measure and analyze their movements, we can now see animals with more clarity and precision than ever before. The research is having a significant impact on robotics, materials science and a range of other fields.\n\nJerry\u2019s fellow dogs and a number of other species have flexible spines supported by pliable back muscles and controlled by a network of neurons called the central pattern generator; this combination allows them to turn, twist, run, swim and recover from a trip or misstep without the lag time of waiting for commands from the brain. Most modern commercial robots, by contrast, are controlled by a central processing unit that sends commands to each of the joints.\n\n\u2018Salamandrica Robotica\u2019 in a pool\n\nA decade ago, a team at Switzerland\u2019s Biorobotics Laboratory at EPFL, in Lausanne, built a four-legged walker called Salamandra Robotica. It is able to move autonomously without feedback from a central processing unit because its body segments are controlled by central pattern generators. Upgraded in 2013, it can make a seamless transition from water to land. It\u2019s like an all-terrain wind-up toy.\n\nSnakes provide a different model of spine flexibility as they twist, bend and compress themselves. A snake-like robot developed at Carnegie Mellon University can slither into spaces too narrow for other types of devices. Each of its individual segments senses its environment and calculates how much force to exert and in what direction. One such snakebot was deployed to assist in search and rescue operations in the 2017 earthquake in Mexico City.\n\nA long-standing difficulty for robots is moving through sand, which covers a third of the Earth (including several recent combat zones for the U.S. military) and even more of our nearest planetary neighbors. Because sand is composed of small grains that together can act like a fluid or a solid, depending on the conditions, its subtle physics creates sinkholes that can quickly bury large objects. In 2010, the $400-million Mars rover Spirit ended six years of exploration when its wheels got ensnared in a sand trap. As the rover struggled to free itself, it sank deeper and deeper.\n\nThe \u2018Sandbot,\u2019 a scaled-down version of an all-terrain RHex robot, seeks to whip its curved legs through porous surfaces in the mode of a sandfish lizard. Photo: Georgia Tech; Joel Sartore/National Geographic/Getty Images\n\nBut some animals revel in sand. The sandfish, a lizard about the size of a hand, can virtually dive and swim through it, whipping and churning its legs to take advantage of sand\u2019s fluid or solid properties. To replicate some of that motion, researchers at the University of Pennsylvania developed RHex, a robot with six quick-whipping legs, and a scaled-down version dubbed the Sandbot.\n\nWhile most all-terrain vehicles use large wheels or treads to better distribute their weight and keep the sand solid underneath them, RHex modulates the speed of its distinctive feet to keep the sand from becoming fluid, like a person walking on thin ice. The robot is now being manufactured by Boston Dynamics for military applications, among others.\n\nPhoto: Biorobotics Laboratory at EPFL\n\nWater poses an even more complex problem for robots, and here guidance has come from another animal: the insect known as a water strider, which moves exclusively across the surfaces of bodies of water.\n\nHow it does this perplexed biologists for decades. They eventually found part of the answer in the insect\u2019s flexible legs, which are covered with tiny hairs that create air cushions and keep it from breaking the surface. The big puzzle was how striders, especially baby striders, could accelerate to start moving and keep moving fast enough to generate the water ripples that propel them. That question, known as Denny\u2019s Paradox after the Stanford biologist Mark Denny, was solved by scientists (including me) by studying the fluid dynamics just under the surface as the striders moved. It turns out that their air-cushioned legs create tiny dimples on the water surface that gather into complex, churning wakes. These do more than water ripples to propel them.\n\nA robot version of a water strider faces off against the real insect in a Seoul National University lab. Photo: Seoul National University\n\nWith this research in hand, my colleagues and I at MIT (where I was then a graduate student) were able in 2003 to build the world\u2019s first dry rowboat, the Robostrider. Powered by an elastic band, it skims atop the water on flexible legs that create the robot\u2019s own dimples and vortices. New fabrication technologies have enabled other researchers to design and test at least 20 much-improved versions, most recently at Harvard and Seoul National University. The hope is to use them as cheap devices to deploy widely for surveillance and for chemical monitoring of the oceans, including measuring oil spills.\n\nFor movement through the air, animal attributes also have human ingenuity beat, especially when it comes to navigating obstacles. The honeybee picks up 30% of its weight in pollen on every trip to and from the hive, but even more impressively, it does this while brushing past hundreds of plant stems waving back and forth in the wind.\n\nA standard human approach would be to design a miniature airplane, with a complex camera and computer, to dodge each plant stem. But nature\u2019s solution is simpler and more effective: a resilient bee that survives running into flowers more than 400,000 times in its lifetime.\n\nThe bee can do this because of an elastic material in its wings called resilin, which allows it to crumple its wings like folding origami and bounce back. Drone designs are now being developed at EPFL and elsewhere using bee models\u2014not replicating their wings but using springs and detachable magnetic parts to make them more collision-proof.\n\nEPFL built a \u2018Cheetah-cub\u2019 with spring-loaded legs to mimic the gait of its namesake at a house cat\u2019s size. Photo: iStock; Biorobotics Laboratory. EPFL. Switzerland\n\nThe flexible spine and gait of dogs and other mammals have influenced a growing menagerie of robot designs. EPFL has built a catlike \u201cCheetah-cub\u201d with spring-loaded legs that weighs just over two pounds and what it calls a Bobcat to copy the distinctive bounding movement of the real thing. Boston Dynamics says that its Wildcat, which runs at nearly 20 miles per hour, is the fastest-moving robot yet. Starting next year the company plans to market its Great Dane-sized SpotMini to businesses as a dog-like helper to fetch and carry items around workplaces.\n\nUntil now, robots have mostly been used in factories, where they perform repetitive motions like installing windshields or applying paint. For robots to be able to go out into nature and other settings, they have to be prepared to navigate a range of environments and recover from multiple mistakes. Studying sandfish, water striders and bees probably won\u2019t transform the way that humans travel the world, but it may revolutionize the movements of our machines. Robots are becoming increasingly lightweight, autonomous and mobile, and soon they may become as agile as a toy poodle shaking itself dry.\n\n\u2014This essay is adapted from Dr. Hu\u2019s new book, \u201cHow to Walk on Water and Climb up Walls: Animal Movement and the Robots of the Future,\u201d which will be published on Nov. 13 by Princeton University Press.

Photo: Library of Congress\n\nIn late February 1919, the soldiers of Company B reached the breaking point, when griping gave way to mutiny.\n\nThe Americans had expected to face Germans on the Western Front. Yet three months after the Nov. 11 armistice ended the Great War, they were instead fighting Bolshevik revolutionaries in Russia\u2019s frigid European north.\n\nDozens of their fellow troops had succumbed to influenza on the sea voyage to the Russian port of Archangel. Others had been killed in combat by an enemy armed with a local\u2019s knowledge of trails and villages. Wounded Americans had frozen to death awaiting rescue in snowy forests.\n\nOver the fall and winter, U.S. troops felt misled by their government, deceived by their officers, abused by their allies and outgunned by their enemy, fighting in a war that was already over.\n\nMany Americans demonstrated bravery and fortitude in the frozen-mud swamps and pine forests around Archangel. Others gave into the temptations of rebellion.\n\nU.S. Army troops fight and drill in the snow on the front lines outside of Archangel. Video courtesy of the National Archives\n\nThe discontent blistered to the surface on Company B\u2019s ration day, when the men in line realized the Army wasn\u2019t issuing enough food to hold them until the next delivery. \u201cHey, fellows, let\u2019s stop all the God damn talk and do something,\u201d Pvt. Bill Henkelman told the other soldiers.\n\nPvt. Henkelman and three others drafted an ultimatum addressed to the regiment commander. If not withdrawn from the front by March 15, 1919, the soldiers wrote, \u201cwe positively refuse to advance\u201d against the enemy.\n\nPvt. Henkelman, who painted car bodies at Detroit\u2019s American Auto Trimming Co. before being drafted, told the soldiers he would cross enemy lines alone, carrying a white flag. He would invite the Bolsheviks to a goodbye party. Then he and his co-conspirators would walk away from the war.\n\nFour days later, U.S. Army officers caught wind of the plot. Pvt. Henkelman was hauled before a court-martial and charged with treason, desertion and mutiny\u2014crimes punishable by death.\n\nMore on World War I The Reinvention of Warfare\n\nAt the hearing, the private tore open his uniform blouse and exposed his chest to the judges: \u201cLook at the lice, the dirt, the filth. We are half-starved,\u201d he said in his defense. \u201cBut none of you have lice or go hungry.\u201d\n\nSailors from USS Olympia pose with newly arrived soldiers from the 339th Infantry Regiment on Sept. 6, 1918. Photo: Bentley Historical Library\n\nWashington and Moscow have been hot-war allies and Cold War adversaries. The only time U.S. and Russian troops battled each other came a century ago, with the heaviest fighting in the Archangel campaign that so aggrieved Pvt. Henkelman. It didn\u2019t go well for the Americans, a loss all but erased from the country\u2019s collective historical memory on the 100th anniversary of the end of the Great War.\n\nIn the early years of World War I, Imperial Russia fought beside France, Britain and the U.S. against Germany and its allies. Then the 1917 Russian Revolution upended the alliance.\n\nThe Bolsheviks seized power in Moscow and, on March 3, 1918, signed a peace deal with Germany. The pact allowed Germany to focus on the Western Front. The Bolsheviks, led by Vladimir Lenin, turned to defending their revolution from White Russians, supporters of czarist rule who were backed by the British and French.\n\nIn the late summer and early fall of 1918, President Woodrow Wilson added some 5,300 American soldiers to that volatile mix, sending them to northern Russia with vague and contradictory orders.\n\nThis account of the 1918 Archangel campaign is based on century-old military records, declassified government memos, personal letters, diaries, photos and film in the National Archives and Records Administration, and the Bentley Historical Library at the University of Michigan, as well as soldiers\u2019 memoirs.\n\nSoldiers from Company B of the 339th Infantry Regiment wear snowshoes during a patrol in northern Russia. Photo: Bentley Historical Library\n\nE for Russia\n\nThe 339th Infantry Regiment was known as Detroit\u2019s Own. Most of the 3,800 car-factory workers, tax attorneys, farm laborers, shopkeepers and other conscripts who filled its ranks hailed from Michigan.\n\nThe men underwent a month or so of infantry training at Camp Custer in Battle Creek, Mich., before traveling to New York and embarking on ships to England in July 1918.\n\nThe troops assumed they were headed to the Western Front, a 450-mile stretch of trenches and barbed wire that ran between Switzerland and the North Sea. Rumors of other destinations also circulated.\n\nPvt. Walter McKenzie figured his mail would be censored. So he wrote his girlfriend, Connie Loveday, that he would use code to let her know where he was headed: A would be Belgium; B would be England; E for Russia. Pvt. McKenzie urged her to memorize the code and destroy the letter, but Ms. Loveday kept it.\n\nThe private was raised by his widowed mother, and at age 9 he went to work picking fruit in Shelby, Mich. At 14, he got a permit for a factory job. He worked his way through the University of Michigan, earned a law degree and became a lawyer for the Internal Revenue Service. Poor eyesight didn\u2019t keep him out of the service.\n\nA soldier\u2019s cartoon drawn in 1919 shows the U.S. pounding a Bolshevik.

Unaccustomed to hammocks or sea voyages, some tumbled onto the floor. \u201cI am sorry to say that extreme profanity is common at all times,\u201d Pvt. McKenzie reported to his mother. As they approached England, the soldiers, fearing torpedoes from German submarines, slept in their clothes and life belts, full canteens by their sides.\n\nThe ships put in at Liverpool on Aug. 4, 1918. The troops rode a train to a tent camp set up on the estate of the widow of Henry Stanley, the Africa explorer.\n\nOn Sunday, Aug. 18, Pvt. McKenzie was heading to church services when commanders ordered the troops to line up to receive woolen suits, woolen gloves and heavy leather mittens.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still conjecture as to where we shall go,\u201d Pvt. McKenzie wrote his mother, \u201cbut I don\u2019t believe it will be sunny Italy.\u201d\n\nA week later, the 339th, along with engineering, ambulance and medical companies, loaded aboard three camouflage-painted steamers at Newcastle upon Tyne and set out on the eight-day journey to the port of Archangel.\n\nGodforsaken\n\nAfter a few days at sea, the first soldiers showed symptoms of Spanish flu, a pandemic that in 1918 and 1919 killed between 20 million and 40 million people world-wide. Men came down with fever faster than the doctors could treat them. Drug supplies ran short; medical wards overflowed.\n\nThe ships cruised north of the Arctic Circle, passing polar bears and snow-covered hills, sailed through the narrow neck of the White Sea and entered the Dvina River.\n\nOn the gray afternoon of Sept. 4, 1918, the men disembarked at Archangel, a crescent-shaped port with grubby docks, muddy streets and a cathedral dome painted blue with gold stars.\n\nU.S. Army troops disembark at Archangel for service in northern Russia. Video courtesy of the National Archives\n\nThe city had been wrested from Bolshevik hands just a month earlier, in an operation led by French, British and White Russian forces.\n\nAs the American soldiers walked down the gangplank, they were greeted by the University of Michigan fight song, \u201cThe Victors,\u201d played by the band from the warship USS Olympia.\n\nHail to the victors valiant\n\nHail to the conquering heroes\n\nHail! Hail! To Michigan\n\nThe champions of the West!\n\nHungry Russians soon descended on the ship\u2019s trash, looking for scraps of food.\n\n\u201cThis is really the most godforsaken hole on Earth,\u201d Lt. Charles Ryan, an accountant by profession, wrote in his diary. \u201cNever did I strike such a fine set of assorted odors. The people are filthy and seem starved to death.\u201d\n\nA side street in Archangel. April 1919. Photo: American Red Cross/Library of Congress\n\nWithin two weeks of arriving in Archangel, nearly 40 soldiers in the 339th had died of the flu. \u201cWe have lost a great number, this included some very good friends of mine,\u201d Lt. Ryan wrote home.\n\nAround the time President Wilson dispatched the force to Archangel, he had also ordered a separate contingent to Siberia, 3,500 miles east of Archangel. Their mission was to rescue 40,000 Czech troops who had sided with the Allies and were trying to escape Russia. Mr. Wilson\u2019s orders for the Archangel campaign weren\u2019t as clear-cut.\n\nThe men of the 339th disembarked in Russia with the understanding that they were to guard military stores from the Germans. The Wilson administration made plain that Americans wouldn\u2019t intervene in the civil war, saying that would only \u201cadd to the sad confusion in Russia rather than cure it.\u201d\n\n3rd Battalion headquarters in a boxcar on the Vologda Railroad Front, November 15, 1918. Photo: U.S. Army Signal Corps/Bentley Historical Library\n\nBut Mr. Wilson put the U.S. troops under British command, and British commanders had other ideas. They envisioned British, American, French and other Allied forces pushing south from Archangel to link up with the Czechs and reverse the Russian Revolution.\n\nAlmost as soon as the 339th set foot on the dock in Archangel, the British ground commander, Lt. Gen. Frederick Poole, ordered two U.S. battalions to reinforce his men against the Bolsheviks.\n\nThe Americans were sent into combat so quickly, there wasn\u2019t time to unload their winter gear from the holds of the transport ships. The men didn\u2019t receive their sheepskin coats until after the first snow in October.\n\nScenes of life behind the front lines in the city of Archangel. Video courtesy of the National Archives\n\nOne battalion moved more than 300 miles southeast along the Dvina River to help British troops in a failed lunge for Kotlas. The other shipped out in boxcars along the rail line in an aborted British attempt to capture Vologda, a transportation hub about 460 miles south of Archangel.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t what President Wilson had authorized. But the commander of the 339th obeyed the British general\u2019s orders, and Washington didn\u2019t object.\n\nWithin days of coming ashore, the inexperienced Americans were engaged in heavy combat with Bolshevik troops armed with airplanes, artillery and machine guns.\n\nTroops from Company M after a 17-hour march on their way to the front.

Bolshevik artillerymen began their barrage before daylight.\n\nOne man was killed, three were wounded and one was sidelined with shell shock in the battle against the Bolos, as they called the enemy. \u201cSay a prayer for Charlie,\u201d Lt. Charles Ryan wrote his girlfriend.\n\nAt the front, troops often survived on canned corned beef and hard tack.\n\nSoldiers eating and drinking at the rail yards.

Ryan holed up in a convent on the Dvina River, where he dined on vegetable soup, boiled potatoes, roast pheasant and canned pears. He contributed his flour ration to the kitchen, and the nuns baked white bread.\n\nInvitation to a party at the convalescent hospital in Archangel.

The men watched Charlie Chaplin movies and danced with Red Cross nurses and local women with bob haircuts. Troops decorated the mess halls with flags and evergreen boughs. They visited red brick bathhouses, alternating between steam rooms and cooling rooms.\n\n\u201cI made a hit with an eskimo girl spent the day riding around the Divina River with a Reindeer taking photographs,\u201d Cpl. Fred Kooyers of Muskegon, Mich., wrote in his diary. Not long after, the major gave him a lecture on venereal disease.\n\nTwo months after the 339th arrived in Archangel, the Great War came to an end with the signing of the armistice in a train carriage parked in a French forest. Within hours, the guns fell silent on the Western Front.\n\nReindeer taxis on Dvina River. Photo: Joel Moore/Mike Grobbel Collection\n\n\u201cIt looks\u2026as if our going home was rapidly becoming an assured fact,\u201d Pvt. McKenzie wrote his mother from Russia the day after the signing.\n\nThe men of the 339th soon learned the peace agreement didn\u2019t extend to them. \u201cI don\u2019t see why we are up here anyway, as the war was with Germany not Russia as far as I can see,\u201d Sgt. Carleton Foster wrote his mother from Archangel two weeks after the armistice. \u201cIf these people want to fight among themselves what is it to us.\u201d\n\nAmerican commanders were hard-pressed to explain. Col. James Ruggles, the U.S. military attach\u00e9 in Archangel, told headquarters that neither enlisted men nor their officers could understand why they were still fighting.\n\nCompany M officers in Obozersky, Russia. The commander, Capt. Joel Moore, is on the far right. Photo: U.S. Army Signal Corps/Bentley Historical Library\n\nHis concerns reached Gen. John \u201cBlack Jack\u201d Pershing, commander of U.S. forces in the war, and then landed on the desk of the Army chief of staff in Washington.\n\nBy December, the daylight around Archangel lasted only about four hours, and temperatures fell as low as 50 degrees below zero. In such cold, soldiers could only remain on guard duty for 15 minutes at a time.\n\nWith so many U.S. field units under the command of British officers, American soldiers on the front lines believed they were \u201cbeing used to further selfish designs of England upon Russian territory,\u201d Col. Ruggles reported.\n\nU.S. censors in Liverpool, who rifled through the letters soldiers sent home, cabled Archangel to complain about anti-British missives. \u201cThey are unsoldierly in tone,\u201d the message said.\n\nOne letter caught by the censors read: \u201cAmerica does not have the least conception of this situation, if they did they would pull us out of here without any hesitancy,\u201d Sgt. Thomas F. Moran wrote in December. \u201cWe are fighting for British interest and spilling good American blood and wasting good American lives for a cause that our government surely does not understand.\u201d\n\nBolshevik propaganda specialists encouraged such dissension. \u201cYoung America, what are you fighting for?\u201d the Bolsheviks yelled across the battle lines, according to a letter home in December from Lt. Bradley Taylor. \u201cWhy are you lying in the swamps while the British are sitting in the rear and enjoying nice warm billets?\u201d\n\nU.S. military censors intercepted the lieutenant\u2019s letter before it reached his family in Rhinelander, Wis.\n\nThe Call, a Bolshevik propaganda newspaper, circulated among the U.S. troops. \u201cWorkers of All Countries Unite!\u201d the paper\u2019s motto said.\n\nAn issue of the Bolshevik propaganda newspaper, The Call, which circulated among American troops in northern Russia. Photo: Bentley Historical Library\n\nBolshevik leaflets littered the front lines. \u201cBring down the whole rotten edifice of your capitalist state with the shattering blow of your arms!\u201d said one. \u201cDemand to be sent home,\u201d another said.\n\nU.S. officers tried to boost morale. At Christmas, every soldier in Company K received 50 cents to spend on plum pudding and other luxuries at the British canteen in Archangel. The Red Cross issued each man a Christmas stocking filled with raisins, dates, candy, cigarettes and the other sock.\n\n\u2018Unswerving loyalty\u2019\n\nOn Jan. 19, 1919, the Bolsheviks launched an offensive that proved a turning point.\n\nThe Americans in the fall had often faced poorly trained Bolshevik conscripts. The 339th now found itself under attack by 4,000 or so battle-hardened troops. The Bolsheviks first hit Ust Padenga\u2014a village on the Vaga River where the Americans had hunkered down for the winter\u2014with three days of artillery and machine-gun fire.\n\nA U.S. lieutenant mans a machine gun in northern Russia. Photo: John Wilson/Bentley Historical Library\n\nDuring the fighting, Cpl. James Chesher\u2019s machine gun was knocked over by artillery fire. He propped it up and kept shooting until his arm was blown off. Cpl. Joseph Franczak fought off advancing infantry from an exposed position on a road until his hand was shot away.\n\nLt. Ralph Powers, a medic from Amherst, Ohio, moved his aid station three times in search of cover, before a direct hit by a Bolshevik artillery round critically wounded the lieutenant and killed three of his patients.\n\nA Russian doctor administered first aid to Lt. Powers\u2019s wounded arm and leg. Soldiers loaded the lieutenant onto a sleigh and evacuated him 20 miles north to the town of Shenkursk. A surgeon there amputated his arm, but he didn\u2019t survive.\n\nThe rest of the joint forces in Ust Padenga\u2014American infantry, Canadian artillerymen and a company of Cossacks\u2014also fell back to Shenkursk. They held out for two days, until nearly surrounded by the pursuing Bolsheviks.\n\nA soldier\u2019s map of the Bolshevik attack on Ust Padenga on Jan. 19, 1919. The assault forced American and allied troops into a desperate retreat. Photo: Bentley Historical Library via Mike Grobbel\n\nThe Americans had to leave Lt. Powers\u2019s body in a shed by the hospital when they abandoned the town. They and their allies retreated on foot another 50 miles, chased through snow by enemy troops. Some 700 civilians fled with the retreating forces.\n\nDuring the battle, 29 Americans were killed and 58 wounded; 19 went missing. \u201cMost of those missing are believed to have been wounded and probably frozen,\u201d the regimental commander reported to headquarters.\n\nGraves of some of the first Americans killed in action in northern Russia, Mechanic Ignacy H.

Photo: U.S. Signal Corps/Bentley Historical Library\n\nCol. Ruggles, the U.S. military attach\u00e9, declared the situation around Archangel critical: Too few American troops were spread over too wide a front, facing an enemy superior in numbers, arms and morale.\n\nBack in Michigan, enthusiasm slumped, fueled by pessimistic news dispatches and the horror stories told by wounded soldiers who had returned home.\n\nLt. Powers\u2019s father, Dr. Harry W. Powers, wrote the U.S. military attach\u00e9 in Archangel a few weeks after his son\u2019s death: \u201cWe want to have his body returned to the United States when conditions will permit.\u201d\n\nIn February 1919, thousands of civilians around Detroit petitioned Congress to demand the withdrawal of U.S. forces from northern Russia. Signature pages such as this one were circulated widely. Photo: Bentley Historical Library\n\nIn February, thousands of family members and their supporters signed a petition to Congress demanding a withdrawal from north Russia\u2014or at least reinforcements and better food.\n\nThe families swore their \u201cunswerving loyalty\u201d to the U.S. At the same time, they complained that the American troops in northern Russia \u201cnot only are suffering incredible hardships, but are in grave danger.\u201d\n\nThe commander of the 339th, Col. George Stewart, was swamped with letters from parents who wanted to know if their sons were still alive. The deluge was \u201cinterfering with official business,\u201d the colonel wrote, begging headquarters to put the word out to Detroit and Chicago newspapers that the situation around Archangel was under control.\n\nWinter discontent\n\nWhite Russian soldiers were the first to mutiny that winter.\n\nOn Dec. 11, 1918, two companies from the Archangel Regiment refused orders to the front. The rebels barricaded themselves in the Alexandra Nevsky Barracks and shot at loyal Russian troops sent to dislodge them. American troops, summoned to contain the uprising, fired machine guns through the windows. The mutineers emerged under a white flag.\n\nThe Russian commander ordered the troops to identify the instigators of the revolt, threatening to execute every 10th man if they didn\u2019t. Loyal troops lined up 13 of the alleged leaders against a wall and shot them.\n\nOn March 1, the French Second Company refused to relieve American troops along the Archangel-Vologda rail line. The French soldiers finally agreed to advance, but only to a position behind the front, where they drank heavily. Soon after, the French stopped fighting.\n\nOn the railroad front in North Russia, soldiers lived in box cars. A January 1919 view of the railcars used as headquarters offices in Archangel.

The Scots, who had fought fiercely in the summer of 1918, \u201ccame to be regarded as an unreliable fighting unit,\u201d a U.S. military report said.\n\nDiscontent turned to disobedience among the American troops as well.\n\nSoldiers in Company A of the 339th tried to forge a separate peace with Bolshevik soldiers across from their lines. One American, apparently the son of Russian or Eastern European immigrants, drafted the truce offering in rough Russian on Knights of Columbus stationery decorated with an American flag. The writer complained about the deceit of the British officers and the absence of British troops on the front lines.\n\n\u201cWe are combating you and fighting you only to stay alive,\u201d the letter said. \u201cWe support your desire to give up the crown and throw the Tsarism down to the ground, and we are ready to help you because it\u2019s for the good of the working people.\u201d\n\nThe note, signed by \u201cThe Soldiers of the United States,\u201d said: \u201cWe will not attack you and if you, dear comrades, will hold off for two-and-a-half months, we will all go back home from Russia.\u201d It wasn\u2019t clear whether the note was ever delivered.\n\nA soldier in Company A who spoke basic Russian wrote this peace offer to the Bolshevik troops across from his position. Photo: Bentley Historical Library\n\nAt first, the commander of the 339th, Col. Stewart, sent rosy cables to headquarters. \u201cCondition of infantry health discipline morale clothing and equipment excellent,\u201d he wrote on Feb. 13, 1919. Rumors to the contrary back in Michigan, he said, were a \u201cslur\u2026cast on the regiment.\u201d\n\nThere were indeed many reports of battlefield heroics. American troops received French, White Russian and British medals for valor.\n\nOther American officers were less optimistic. Capt. Eugene Prince, who provided intelligence assessments to the U.S. military attach\u00e9 in Archangel, wrote a stinging memo about the dismal troop morale.\n\nAmerican soldiers pose with their French medals for valor in northern Russia. Photo: U.S. Army Signal Corps\n\nJust a few weeks after the captain\u2019s report, Pvt. Henkelman and Company B were in revolt. More than 65 men signed the ultimatum demanding withdrawal from the battlefront by March 15.\n\nThe ultimatum, however, was a ruse. The mutineers circulated it to see how many soldiers were willing to rise up against their commanders. Once the rebels knew whom to trust, they intended to disarm their officers, seize control of Company B and desert the front.\n\nOne conspirator, Sgt. Silver Parrish, was born in Jenny Lind, Ark. He worked in Ohio coal mines as a teenager, and was employed as a die setter at Fisher Body Co. in Detroit when he was called up by the Army. He couldn\u2019t understand why\u2014after the war against Germany had ended\u2014he and his friends were fighting young Russian men plucked from their own coal mines and factories.\n\n\u201cThe majority of the people here are in sympathy with the Bolo & I don\u2019t blame them,\u201d Sgt. Parrish wrote in his diary.\n\nSgt. Parrish\u2019s squad had months earlier been ordered to burn a village that gave cover to enemy snipers. Local women dropped to the ground and grabbed the sergeant\u2019s legs, begging for mercy. The soldiers torched the houses anyway. \u201cOrders are orders,\u201d Sgt. Parrish wrote in his diary.\n\nA burned Russian landscape. Photo: John Wilson/Bentley Historical Library\n\nBy late February, he was fed up. \u201cThis life is just 1 dam thing after another,\u201d he wrote in his diary.\n\nThe commanders, hoping to tamp down brewing unrest, pulled Company B off the front line and let the conspirators go unpunished. In return, Pvt. Henkelman promised to use his influence to quiet dissent.\n\nPvt.

Each man\u2019s sense of injustice echoed off the grievances of comrades, building to an angry crescendo. They had endured rain, hail and snow, marched through swamps and streams and lost men in battle.\n\nMen from Machine Gun Company saw logs to use for reinforcing fighting positions. Photo: U.S. Army Signal Corps/Bentley Historical Library\n\nSome of the soldiers had received letters with Detroit newspaper clippings about a U.S. senator who was questioning the wisdom of sending the 339th to Russia.\n\nIt was an inopportune moment for the first sergeant to order them to load the sleds and return to the front. The men refused to leave the barracks and threatened mutiny if Washington didn\u2019t set a withdrawal date.\n\nThe sergeant reported to the captain, who alerted Col. Stewart that he had an uprising on his hands. The colonel was a regular Army officer and had earned the Medal of Honor, the nation\u2019s highest military award, for braving enemy fire to save a drowning man during the Philippine insurrection in 1899. He was described by the Grand Rapids Herald as \u201can American officer every inch, and a good one.\u201d\n\nThe colonel gathered the soldiers and reminded them the penalty for mutiny was death. \u201cWhy are we fighting in Russia?\u201d the men asked.\n\nCol. Stewart said he didn\u2019t know why. \u201cWhatever other reasons there may be, there is one good reason why we must fight now,\u201d he told the soldiers. \u201cIf we don\u2019t fight, we will all be wiped out.\u201d\n\nMilitary sled convoy near Jillena, Russia on Jan. 18, 1919.

The men agreed to return to the front only after the release of a private who had already been arrested. The officers agreed.\n\nThe men grudgingly loaded the sleds, crossed the iced-over Dvina River and boarded the train to the front. They were soon under attack from artillery rounds and Bolshevik raiding parties.\n\nCensors couldn\u2019t keep the rebellion quiet. The Grand Rapids Herald ran the headline: \u201cMutiny in Russia Alarms Capital: General Outbreak Among 339th Men Now Open Threat; When Shall We go Home? Boys Want To Know.\u201d\n\nThe Grand Rapids Herald reported on the Company I mutiny. Photo: Bentley Historical Library\n\nPresident Wilson had already had enough. In March, he met in Paris with his new northern Russia commander, Brig. Gen. Wilds P. Richardson, and told him to withdraw American troops from Archangel as soon as the White Sea ice broke up.\n\nOn April 8, 1919, Col. Stewart told his men they would be going home. He also reminded them of their obligation to fight to the end. \u201cIt could never be forgotten for an instant the reputation an American makes for himself in the service of his country will follow him through life,\u201d the colonel warned.\n\nU.S. Army troops embark on ships to depart Archangel for home in May of 1919. Video courtesy of the National Archives\n\nThe bulk of the U.S. forces withdrew by the end of June 1919. All told, 6,083 Americans served in northern Russia. Of those, 144 were killed in action or died from their wounds, and 100 died from disease, suicide or accident. Another 305 survived shrapnel wounds, gunshots and other injuries.\n\nBritish forces withdrew from Archangel by the end of September 1919, and the Bolsheviks took the city from the remaining White Russian defenders in February, 1920. The American expedition to Siberia ended in 1920.\n\nEpilogue\n\nThe Army retrieved 120 American bodies from northern Russia in the fall of 1919. When the remains arrived in Detroit, a bugler played taps in otherwise silent streets. Theodore McPhail, whose brother had served in Russia, watched the passing parade.\n\n\u201cI was thinking of the fool hardy expedition those poor fellows died for and the God forsaken place they must have died in,\u201d he recalled.\n\nThe flag-draped coffins of 111 American servicemen killed in Russia arrive in the U.S. Photo: FPG/Hulton Archive/Getty Images\n\nThe humbling U.S. withdrawal led to finger-pointing. A military memo buried in the National Archives summed up the undeclared war-within-a-war. In it, Capt. Hugh S. Martin wrote to the U.S. military attach\u00e9 in Archangel:\n\n\u201cThe real truth was, we were waging war against Bolshevism. Everybody knew that. Yet no Allied government ever stated that that was its policy in intervening\u2026The result was that in the course of a day the ordinary soldier would hear any number of varying\u2014and sometimes contradictory\u2014replies to the questions which were constantly being asked; for example, why were they being called upon to fight here after the fighting on the Western Front had ceased\u2026what were our reasons for making war on the Bolsheviks; why not let Russia take care of her own internal affairs, etc.\u201d\n\nVeterans of the north Russia campaign\u2014who called their war the Polar Bear Expedition\u2014formed the Polar Bear Association in 1922. They shared a sense of obligation to retrieve their roughly 120 comrades whose bodies remained in Russia.\n\nArchangel veterans and Michigan politicians lobbied Congress and the state for funds, and in July 1929 a five-man commission set out for Russia. They drew up maps with notes such as \u201cLt. Ballard Killed Here\u201d and \u201c6 Graves Block Houses.\u201d\n\nThe commissioners dug up the bodies of 86 Americans. Among those who were returned home was Lt. Powers, the Ohio medic whose body was left behind in a hospital shed during the retreat from Ust Padenga.\n\nA November 1919 ceremony in Hoboken, N.J., for soldiers of the 339th regiment who died in northern Russia.

Now, 29 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, conflict of a different kind has returned to the famous transit point.\n\nAmong the questions raised: Is it a good spot for a Hard Rock Hotel? And what does \u201cBaywatch\u201d star David Hasselhoff think?\n\nA redevelopment plan for the former Soviet side calls for a mix of commercial space, rental apartments, a museum and the music-themed hotel. Backers of the Checkpoint Charlie plan say anything would be an improvement on the current mixture of empty building lots and mobile sausage stands.\n\nOpponents fear the project would turn the landmark into an undignified tourist trap unworthy of its significance. The local parliament must approve the plan before construction can begin.\n\n\u201cThere has never been a Hard Rock Hotel in Berlin and it\u2019s been fine,\u201d said Katalin Gennburg, a representative for the Left Party in Berlin\u2019s parliament, adding that a kitschy hotel chain on the site of former Soviet tanks is an offense to Berlin\u2019s authentic clubbing culture. \u201cWe are already the party capital of the world without one.\u201d\n\nAmerican tanks, front, and Soviet tanks, rear, faced each other at Checkpoint Charlie in 1961. Photo: DPA/Associated Press\n\nDaniela Billig, a Green Party member in parliament who also opposes the development terms, said it isn\u2019t suitable for native Berliners. \u201cNo one would go to this place,\u201d she said.\n\nHard Rock Hotels said it plans to chronicle Berlin\u2019s music history at the site. Dale Hipsh, a senior vice president, said in a statement that \u201cCheckpoint Charlie is the perfect place to tell a story of how music built a bridge.\u201d\n\nMr. Hasselhoff, who has become a cult figure in Germany, said in an email, \u201cCheckpoint Charlie is a symbol of freedom and should remain as a reminder of the oppression we all face on a daily basis. We must never forget!\u201d\n\nSo far, he has not weighed in on the proposal.\n\nThe debate comes amid tensions between locals eager to preserve Berlin\u2019s counterculture spirit and the entrepreneurs and techies drawn to the German capital\u2019s growing reputation as a European business hub. A backlash pushed Google to drop plans to open a startup hub in a hip neighborhood.\n\nA recent influx of wealth into the city has raised worries. Iris Spranger, a representative for the Social Democrats who supports the Checkpoint Charlie plans, told the parliament recently that Berlin should honor the current proposal, otherwise the plot could end up being auctioned off to the highest bidder.\n\n\u201cWho knows which hedge fund will then acquire the land,\u201d she said.\n\nThe scene at Checkpoint Charlie. Photo: Wolfgang Kumm/DPA/ZUMA PRESS\n\nTrockland Management, the developer behind the current plan, acquired the rights to two plots at Checkpoint Charlie from a previous investor in 2014. Heskel Nathaniel, Trockland\u2019s chief executive, said the local parliament\u2019s delay in granting his firm permission to build is an example of what he perceives as resistance to modernization in Berlin.\n\n\u201cThere is a witch hunt here against real estate, a witch hunt against investors, a witch hunt against developers,\u201d Mr. Nathaniel said.\n\nWithout a go-ahead from the local government by early next year, he said, the plots could end up in foreclosure. Because previous investments in the land ended up in bankruptcy, the site is under management of Berlin\u2019s insolvency administrator, which gave Trockland the rights to the land with a deadline of January 2019 to exercise them, Mr. Nathaniel said.\n\nOn a recent weekday morning, food trucks, pop-up exhibits and a traveling currywurst stand stood on the proposed development site.\n\nTourists crowded before two actors dressed as American soldiers, who charge \u20ac3 ($3.40) each for a photo op in front of a replica Allied checkpoint kiosk, which is sandwiched between a McDonald\u2019s and a KFC. \u201cYou are now leaving the American sector,\u201d said a copy of a Cold War-era sign nearby.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s bittersweet,\u201d said Lonnie English, who was visiting from Los Angeles with his 20-year-old daughter and said he was stationed with the U.S. military in Berlin when the wall fell on Nov. 9, 1989. \u201cTo me it\u2019s a major part of world history. I\u2019m sort of disappointed to see it be commercialized, but we have to go forward.\u201d\n\nProposed construction at other former Cold War landmarks have drawn resistance. Ms. Gennburg, the parliament representative from the Left Party, recalled a series of demonstrations in 2013 against a development at Berlin\u2019s East Side Gallery, one of the longest surviving stretches of the former wall.\n\nThe protests were attended by Mr. Hasselhoff, who gained fame in Germany following a New Year\u2019s Eve 1989 performance of his song \u201cLooking for Freedom\u201d at the then-recently opened Berlin Wall. He has since returned to the nation many times, and professed his support for the German national soccer team and for the preservation of Berlin historical landmarks on social media.\n\nIn 2013, he again performed \u201cLooking for Freedom\u201d out of the back of a truck, as protesters sang along.\n\nDavid Hasselhoff at a protest against a development at Berlin\u2019s East Side Gallery in 2013. Photo: ODD ANDERSEN/AFP/Getty Images\n\nMs. Gennburg said she fears a similar backlash should the Hard Rock project take off. \u201cWhat if David Hasselhoff comes back to Checkpoint Charlie?\u201d she said.\n\nThe East Side Gallery development\u2014for a hotel and apartment complex\u2014moved forward last year, now overseen by Trockland.\n\nMr. Nathaniel pointed to the recent backlash against Google, which ended with the company turning over the keys to a 32,000-square-foot workspace it had rented to a pair of nonprofits. That is making developers second-guess their plans in Berlin, he said.\n\n\u201cBerlin wants to be the startup hub of Europe and you go and scare away Google?\u201d he said. Still, the Israel native, a Berlin resident for more than 30 years, said he is committed to Checkpoint Charlie and to Berlin.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a city you can actually still influence.

VIP tickets offering the chance to meet Mrs. Obama cost up to $2,750, commanding even higher prices on resale sites.\n\nThe stakes are high. Her publisher, Penguin Random House, made a huge bet on Mrs. Obama and her husband last year when it jointly paid them an advance estimated at about $60 million for two books. It was \u201cthe highest advance ever paid in the history of book publishing,\u201d said Thomas Rabe, chief executive of German media giant Bertelsmann SE, which owns 75% of the publishing house.\n\nBooksellers are counting on strong sales. \u201cWe expect it to be the biggest book of the season, if not the year,\u201d said Liz Harwell, senior director of merchandising, trade books at Barnes & Noble Inc. Her upbeat forecast reflects what she described as \u201csignificant preorders\u201d for the title.\n\nEarly indications suggest a keen level of interest in Mrs. Obama\u2019s story.\n\nHer 426-page memoir, a copy of which was obtained by The Wall Street Journal, ranges widely, from her father\u2019s death when he was 55 to the \u201clust, gratitude, fulfillment, wonder\u201d she felt for Barack Obama when their romance began. She describes the \u201cfunereal\u201d morning after the 2016 presidential election. \u201cI will always wonder about what led so many women, in particular, to reject an exceptionally qualified female candidate and instead choose a misogynist as their president,\u201d she writes of the election. Mrs. Obama writes that she will \u201cnever forgive\u201d Donald Trump for having promoted the \u201cbirther\u201d movement questioning then-President Obama\u2019s U.S. citizenship, arguing that the accusations could have led to violence against her family. (Mr. Trump later conceded that Mr. Obama was born in the U.S.) She dismisses speculation about her own political future: \u201cI have no intention of running for office, ever. I\u2019ve never been a fan of politics, and my experience over the last ten years has done little to change that.\u201d\n\nAsked Friday if he had a response to Mrs. Obama, Mr. Trump said he hadn\u2019t seen what she wrote. \u201cShe got paid a lot of money to write a book,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters. \u201cAnd they always insist that you come up with controversial.\u201d\n\nMrs. Obama has never attempted a book this ambitious. Her one previous book, \u201cAmerican Grown: The Story of the White House Kitchen Garden and Gardens Across America,\u201d has sold a solid 62,000 hardcover copies, according to book tracker NPD BookScan.\n\nFor her memoir to meet the high expectations placed on it, the writing must be compelling, industry watchers say. \u201cA memoir is always dependent on authenticity,\u201d said Lorraine Shanley, president of consulting firm Market Partners International. \u201cThe voice has to sound like Michelle.\u201d\n\nPenguin Random House\u2019s Crown Publishing is printing 1.8 million hardcover copies for the U.S. and Canada, and an additional 1.2 million hardcover copies for other markets. Only two nonfiction titles published in the U.S. have sold more than 2 million hardcover copies since the start of 2010\u2014Laura Hillenbrand\u2019s \u201cUnbroken\u201d and Marie Kondo\u2019s \u201cLife-Changing Magic of Tidying Up\u201d\u2014says NPD BookScan. David Drake, deputy publisher of Crown, declined to discuss the book\u2019s potential revenue or profitability, but said, \u201cWe couldn\u2019t be more optimistic.\u201d\n\nOne New York publishing executive who asked not to be identified suggested that \u201cBecoming,\u201d which has generated strong foreign rights income, would be \u201cvery profitable\u201d if it sells 2 million hardcover copies in the U.S. This person estimated the book could generate as much as $46 million in gross sales in the U.S. across all formats, more revenue than some imprints generate annually. That would go a long way toward recouping the total $60 million advance, which includes an as-yet-untitled memoir from Mr. Obama.\n\nEarly indications suggest a keen level of interest in her story. When tickets to the arena appearances went on presale in September, demand was so high that tour organizer Live Nation added two new dates the same day. The tour promotes itself as \u201can intimate conversation\u201d with the former first lady moderated by celebrity guests, including former White House adviser Valerie Jarrett, actress Tracee Ellis Ross and comedian Phoebe Robinson in addition to Ms. Winfrey and Ms. Witherspoon.\n\nStandard tickets range from $29.50 through $179.50. In late October, packages offering extra perks for the Chicago appearance ranged from $2,500 to $2,750. \u201cDemand for tickets to Michelle Obama\u2019s book tour compared to other public speaking events is nearly unparalleled,\u201d said Stephen Spiewak, manager for digital content marketing at Vivid Seats, a ticket resale site.\n\nMrs. Obama will visit bookstores in the U.S., and some booksellers have been selected to sell books, including previously signed copies, at the arenas where she\u2019s speaking, says Mr. Drake.\n\nShe\u2019ll also take the tour abroad, hoping to defy the conventional wisdom that American political memoirs tend not to do well overseas. Before year-end, she\u2019ll visit three major European capitals in support of the memoir.\n\nAt a time when audiobooks have become increasingly popular with consumers, Mrs. Obama herself narrated the audiobook edition of \u201cBecoming.\u201d It has already generated more preorders than any audiobook previously published by Penguin Random House, said Mr. Drake.\n\nThere\u2019s a proven appetite for Obama-related titles. Former White House photographer Pete Souza\u2019s book \u201cObama: An Intimate Portrait\u201d went on sale in November 2017 and has since sold more than 500,000 copies in print and digital, according to its publisher, Lagardere SCA\u2019s Little, Brown & Co. Mr. Souza\u2019s latest Obama book, \u201cShade,\u201d out in October, is a best seller.\n\nEarlier memoirs by such former first ladies as Nancy Reagan, Barbara Bush, Laura Bush, and Hillary Clinton were all national best-sellers. \u201cFirst Ladies are celebrities, and this is a celebrity-driven society,\u201d said presidential historian Robert Dallek. \u201cThere is an endless interest in the presidency and in anything to do with it.\u201d\n\nWrite to Jeffrey A.

The two sides have been in business for at least 20 years.\n\nPierburg alleged that the supplier\u2019s refusal to ship electric motors from China to Pierburg\u2019s factory in South Carolina unless it paid the 25% tariff cost in full was \u201cextortion.\u201d A failure to deliver the parts could shut down multiple auto factories and \u201cplunge the automotive industry into complete chaos,\u201d Pierburg said in court filings.\n\nJeff Aznavorian, president of Clips & Clamps, wrote to about 15 customers proposing a cost-sharing arrangement for future contracts. A few agreed. Photo: Rachel Woolf for The Wall Street Journal\n\nThe supplier dismissed Pierburg\u2019s claims as \u201chyperbolic rhetoric,\u201d arguing in filings that it was under no contractual obligation to ship parts at the pre-tariff price, because of the \u201cunexpected nature and monumental effect of the current trade war.\u201d\n\nThe automotive supply chain is a complex, global network of interdependent businesses ranging from small, family-owned manufacturers based in the U.S. heartland to large publicly traded overseas auto parts companies\u2014all working in unison to keep cars rolling off the assembly line.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s tariffs have led to higher steel and aluminum prices, and made it more expensive to import Chinese-made car parts such as electric motors and display screens widely used in U.S.-built cars. Tariff-related costs are raising expenses and squeezing profits for big and small auto-industry players, and driving some companies to fight their partners over who pays.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s rattled the whole industry, which tends to think in six-to-seven year timelines and doesn\u2019t handle short-term surprises well,\u201d said Joern Buss, a partner focused on the auto industry at consultant Oliver Wyman.\n\nA judge denied Pierburg\u2019s request to force shipment from the supplier, a unit of Hong Kong-based Johnson Electric Holdings Ltd. Pierburg, a division of Germany\u2019s Rheinmetall AG , is paying the tariff under duress as it considers its legal options, a person familiar with the case said. Court documents show it has requested a jury trial. The companies declined to comment.\n\nA typical vehicle is made up of roughly 30,000 individual parts, and car companies on average work with hundreds of suppliers at once for each model line, either buying components directly or contracting them out further down the chain. Thousands of individual contracts outline in detail parts orders, delivery dates and prices, and many of them are locked in place months and even years in advance.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this notion that these costs efficiently flow through the supply chain and are visited upon customers with a nice, neat label saying \u2018Trump tariffs\u2019,\u201d said John Trentacosta, an attorney at Foley & Lardner in Detroit who represents suppliers. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really happen that way in the automotive supply chain. It\u2019s getting stuck somewhere along the way.\u201d\n\nWhite House officials didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nSorting out the cost of tariffs is difficult because some parts cross the U.S. border multiple times before being installed in a car, blurring the lines of what is \u201cdomestic\u201d content. And although much of the steel used in car manufacturing is American-made, the auto industry is still paying more because a new 25% tariff imposed in June on imports prompted domestic steelmakers to increase prices by an equivalent amount.\n\nA free-trade deal for North America struck in October between the U.S., Canada and Mexico is likely to add more complexity, requiring auto makers to build a greater portion of a vehicle\u2019s content in North America and with higher-wage workers to avoid trade tariffs. Analysts say the new rules will force car companies and suppliers to reconfigure supply chains, likely increasing costs.\n\nOver the summer, some auto makers pre-emptively sent out letters through their legal departments, warning suppliers that the tariffs shouldn\u2019t be a pretext for renegotiating price agreements, say executives and attorneys who were contacted. Some companies are now asking tariff-relief provisions be inserted into new supply agreements going forward, a request nearly unheard of before this summer, say attorneys.\n\nIn July, Toyota Motor Corp.\u2019s purchasing chief, Robert Young, told a room full of supplier executives they shouldn\u2019t count on the Japanese car maker to help absorb the higher tariff-related costs.\n\nToyota is dealing with its own cost-increase concerns, particularly on the nearly two million tons of steel it purchases a year in the U.S. and car parts it sources to China, Mr. Young said in an interview. He estimated that the new tariffs will cost Toyota $100 million this fiscal year and likely even more in the following year.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to have a blanket statement to say we agree to absorb 100% of the costs,\u201d Mr. Young said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s not an open checkbook.\u201d\n\nThe average operating profit margin in the auto parts manufacturing business is already slim\u2013about 7%, according to the Original Equipment Suppliers Association\u2014so extra costs can hit earnings hard. Car companies, facing cooling U.S. demand for cars and trucks after a multiyear growth streak, are also reluctant to pass costs on to car buyers by raising prices.\n\nFord Motor Co. CEO Jim Hackett said in September that tariff-related costs would shave about $1 billion from the company\u2019s bottom line this year. General Motors Co. also dialed back its full-year profit guidance in July, citing rising commodity costs related to new steel and aluminum tariffs.\n\nSome smaller parts suppliers have resorted to pleading with customers for help.\n\nThis summer, Jeff Aznavorian, president of Clips & Clamps Industries, a small Detroit-area parts maker with about 57 employees, sent one-page letters to about 15 customers proposing a cost-sharing arrangement for future contracts. Clips & Clamps was on pace to turn a profit this year, but rising materials costs have wiped out its margin.\n\nTwo customers agreed. A few politely declined. One buyer from Canada wrote back, expressing sympathy. \u201cThey basically said: \u2018I\u2019m sorry your government is doing this to you, but what do you expect me to do about it?\u2019\u201d Mr. Aznavorian said.\n\nOther negotiations have been testier.\n\nPeterson American Corp., North America\u2019s largest privately owned maker of springs used in car engines, was recently told by one of its steel vendors that the company would withhold shipment of the wire coils it delivers to its factories unless the manufacturer agreed to pay the tariff costs.\n\nFaced with the ultimatum, Peterson President Dan Sceli knew he had little choice but to concede. The trucks supply half a dozen Peterson factories in the U.S. and Canada, and any delivery delays could disrupt vehicle production.\n\n\u201cIf I shut down a car plant, that would cost us on the order of $100,000 a minute,\u201d said Mr. Sceli, who also chairs the Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association. \u201cIt\u2019s not an option.\u201d\n\nAfter consulting with lawyers, Mr. Sceli said he agreed to pay \u201cunder duress,\u201d but intends on challenging the price increase and is looking at his legal options.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a couple other suppliers threaten to hold trucks,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s happening all over the industry.\u201d\n\nWrite to Chester Dawson at chester.dawson@wsj.com and Mike Colias at Mike.Colias@wsj.com", "2:29\n\nThis startup wants to be your new tailor\n\nThis startup is trying to shake up the tailoring industry: ALTRD, based in New York City, connects people who need alterations with immigrant women who are experts at sewing and can do the job from home.", "2:29\n\nThis startup wants to be your new tailor\n\nThis startup is trying to shake up the tailoring industry: ALTRD, based in New York City, connects people who need alterations with immigrant women who are experts at sewing and can do the job from home.", "President Donald Trump told reporters at the White House that he doesn't know Matt Whitaker, his new acting attorney general, but that he is \"a very highly respected man.\" Photo: AP\n\nWASHINGTON\u2014President Trump appeared to distance himself from Matthew Whitaker as controversy continued over his appointment as acting attorney general, with some conservative legal scholars questioning whether it was constitutional.\n\nWhen Mr. Trump was asked by reporters about the criticism of Mr. Whitaker, he responded, \u201cI don\u2019t know Matt Whitaker.\u201d That contrasted with an interview with Fox News last month, when the president said, \u201cI can tell you Matt Whitaker\u2019s a great guy.

The study guide says this was the Norman Conquest of 1066. Dr. Hitchcock is among those who say this ignores other possibilities, including the ascension to the throne of William of Orange in 1689.

A 15-minute high-heat blast in the oven ensures that the endive retains its toothsome structure and doesn\u2019t collapse into mush, even as its flavor sweetens and deepens. And the mayonnaise helps to make the recipe foolproof. \u201cI think it\u2019s one of the most important sauces,\u201d said Ms. Raij. \u201cWhen baked, the emulsion breaks and it turns a bit custardy.

Carlsen may already be the greatest player ever but has lacked a worthy rival. Caruana is an aggressive player who could become the first American champion since Bobby Fischer. The players\u2019 combined ratings are the highest for a World Chess Championship ever.\n\nThe chess cognoscenti sense history and dream of the next great chess rivalry, with early comparisons to Kasparov\u2019s famed matches against Anatoly Karpov. Think of it as a budding Lakers-Celtics rivalry for the chessboard.\n\n\u201cThis might be the first of a series of titanic affairs,\u201d said Kassa Korley, an international master.\n\nThe 12-game match, which began with a draw on Friday as Carlsen played the black pieces, is Carlsen\u2019s third title defense. He won the crown in 2013, retained it in 2014 and 2016 and achieved the highest rating ever. If he\u2019s not already the best of all time, he is indisputably part of the conversation. But he has never played someone like Caruana for the world title.\n\nWorld No. 1 Magnus Carlsen makes a move against Fabiano Caruana during a match in Stavanger, Norway on June 17, 2015. Photo: carina johansen/Agence France-Presse/Getty Images\n\nCaruana is often compared to Fischer, the late American savant who beat Soviet champion Boris Spassky in a geopolitically-charged title match in 1972. Caruana was born in Miami and, like Fischer, raised in Brooklyn. He is the United States\u2019 most promising hope in almost half a century. Since narrowly missing the right to play Carlsen for the 2016 title, Caruana has established himself as Carlsen\u2019s clearest rival.\n\nCarlsen hasn\u2019t, in earnest, had a challenger of this caliber during his reign. The Norwegian has continuously held the No. 1 ranking since 2011 and evolved from the chess wunderkind to a swaggering champion who has managed to make the board game at least kind of cool.\n\nBut Caruana is storming the castle with a run of play, including wins over Carlsen, that has created a belief his opponent has a legitimate chance.\n\nCarlsen\u2019s Elo rating is 2835. Caruana\u2019s rating of 2832 is just three points lower. The last title overseen by FIDE\u2014the international chess governing body\u2014that featured the top-two ranked players was when Kasparov played his famous foil, Karpov, in 1990.\n\nSelf-described \"obsessive learner\" Max Deutsch challenged grandmaster Magnus Carlsen to a game of chess. What could possibly go wrong? Video: George Downs/WSJ. Photo: Gordon Welters for The Wall Street Journal\n\nThe chess world sees a potential parallel between those famous matches. Carlsen is still just 27 years old. Caruana is 26. So there\u2019s a chance that no matter who wins that this could be only the beginning of an epic rivalry like the two Soviets shared with their five championship matches.\n\n\u201cComparison with the Karpov-Kasparov seems to be more than justified,\u201d Wojciech Moranda, a Polish grandmaster, wrote in an email. \u201cI can certainly imagine those players battling it out at the highest level for the next decade or so.\u201d\n\nEven for a match that, before it begins, has already been compared to the game\u2019s most memorable moments and figures, there is yet another element: a fascination between two clashing styles. In the computer age of chess preparation, strategic differences are minimal. But Carlsen and Caruana are still known for different and distinct approaches that will make this championship a test of philosophy as much as sheer skill.\n\n\u201cThis is yet another reason why the chess world is going to be following this encounter in awe,\u201d Moranda wrote. \u201cSome even look forward to it in search of a deeper answer as to whether the practical Carlsenesque style or rather Caruana\u2019s concrete approach to chess will prove to be superior.\u201d\n\nChess players describe Carlsen as an acutely intuitive player. He isn\u2019t known to be particularly aggressive. And in a mathematical game, people don\u2019t see his tactics as overly algorithmic. Instead, Carlsen is uniquely talented at exploiting strategic advantages and particular positions over the course of a game that no other chess player might see. \u201cI don\u2019t think Magnus has any clear weaknesses,\u201d Caruana says.\n\nWhile Carlsen is seen as the great chess philosopher, Caruana is noted for a different approach. He is deeply calculating. In contrast to Carlsen\u2019s noted ability to finish off end games, Caruana is said to intensely focus on the opens and search for an early edge.\n\nThat type of aggressive style is another reason experts make the Caruana-Fischer comparison, even though Caruana himself says stylistically he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s quite true.\n\n\u201cCaruana is fearless in a way like Fischer,\u201d said Dylan McClain, a master-level player. \u201cHe really doesn\u2019t care who he\u2019s playing. He\u2019s not going to back down.\u201d\n\nWhile Magnus Carlsen is seen as the great chess philosopher, Fabiano Caruana is noted for being deeply calculating. Photo: WALTER BIERI/EPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock\n\nThis sets up a contrast to the 2016 title match between Carlsen and Sergey Karjakin, which was distinguished by a string of uneventful matches. Observers believe Carlsen was nearly upset for the simple reason that he did not take his opponent, who was ranked No. 9, seriously enough.\n\nCarlsen has indicated he is aware of the unique threat Caruana poses. He has conceded his recent form hasn\u2019t been what people usually expect from him. The player known for his brilliance and bravado said that, lately, his play has been apathetic.\n\nAnd it isn\u2019t chess blasphemy to say Carlsen could lose. Although he has a winning record in his classical head-to-head matches with Caruana, the challenger enters this tournament having shown his pluck. In their last tournament together, they shared a three-way split for first. Before that, Caruana came out on top in two other tournaments.\n\n\u201cI know that if I continue to play in the same vein that I have been recently that I will probably not win,\u201d Carlsen said.\n\nStill, the champion added: \u201cBut I have great confidence in my powers to do exactly that.\u201d\n\nWrite to Andrew Beaton at andrew.beaton@wsj.com", "2:29\n\nThis startup wants to be your new tailor\n\nThis startup is trying to shake up the tailoring industry: ALTRD, based in New York City, connects people who need alterations with immigrant women who are experts at sewing and can do the job from home.", "A Saudi-led coalition and its allies have intensified attacks on a key Yemeni port city to improve their position ahead of peace talks, posing a potential obstacle for U.S. attempts to end Yemen\u2019s war.\n\nThe uproar over the death of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi had appeared to create an opening for the U.S. to seek a cease-fire in the three-year Yemen war, a bloody proxy battle between Saudi-supported forces on the ground and the Iran-backed Houthi militia.

Re-contextualize. Let\u2019s all just pretend that the child cheeseburger\u2014silent killer that it is\u2014never existed. You\u2019ll thank us for this, trust us.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m hoping my concept of de-inventing will become more popular. A couple of weeks ago I sat on a panel during which one of the participants induced mass spontaneous catatonia by launching into an electrifyingly inane PowerPoint presentation. A PowerPoint presentation for a seven-minute talk!\n\nIf anything ever needed to be de-invented, it is PowerPoint. Almost from the moment it reared its ugly head, it was recognized as a cruel weapon. PowerPoint made simple things complicated by turning even the most basic subject into a byzantine series of lists, that then generated other equally tortuous lists, which then gave birth to still other heart-rending, soul-destroying lists.\n\nIt\u2019s not sufficient that PowerPoint gets purged, terminated, sidelined, discontinued. PowerPoint needs to be repudiated. It needs to get smacked in the face. It needs to be de-invented.\n\nFrom time to time, society as a whole will stop in its tracks and admit that it took a wrong turn. This is why serfs no longer exist. Or the Carter Administration. It is why people no longer wear coonskin hats or bustles or chain mail or codpieces.

Leaf blowers need to be de-invented. Smooth jazz should have been de-invented five minutes after it deposed real jazz. Major League Baseball\u2019s video review policy needs to be de-invented. Public service announcements need to be de-invented. Inane, mush-mouthed sideline reporters at football games are prime candidates for de-invention.\n\nIn each of these cases, an honest mistake got completely out of hand and ultimately made life miserable for everybody. But the way to fix this is not merely to turn back the hands of time and purge our collective memories of such monstrosities. It is to admit that we were all idiots to ever accept any of these things in the first place. For without contrition, there can be no forgiveness.\n\nNot everyone agrees on what needs to be de-invented. Some people would say the Electoral College or anyone named Kyle or passwords of no more than 16 characters containing a number, an ampersand and at least one capital letter.

Learn to schmooze.\n\nA handful of U.S. and European museums and galleries have an outsize impact on which contemporary artists achieve lasting, prestigious careers and which don\u2019t, according to a Northeastern University study published Thursday in the journal Science.\n\nNew artists who show their work early in a relatively small network of 400 venues\u2014like Gagosian Gallery or the Guggenheim Museum\u2014are all but guaranteed a successful art career, the study said. By contrast, artists who exhibit mainly in lower-level galleries and midtier institutions are likely to remain stuck in that orbit.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this invisible network of trust that exists in the art world, but the group that decides who matters in art was considerably smaller and more powerful than we expected,\u201d said Albert-L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Barab\u00e1si, a data scientist who studies networks at Northeastern and led the study along with several colleagues including a data scientist now at the World Bank, Samuel Fraiberger. Their findings also show up in Dr. Barab\u00e1si\u2019s book published earlier this week, \u201cThe Formula: The Universal Laws of Success.\u201d\n\nHis findings undermine a popular art-world notion that a prodigy could create in obscurity and get discovered years later. Instead, the research suggests that artists who start out seeking connections with powerful curators, dealers and collectors within the nerve center of the art world are far more likely to hit the big time.\n\nDr. Barab\u00e1si and his team spent the past three years reconstructing the exhibition histories of nearly 500,000 artists, whose work was shown in about 16,000 galleries and 7,500 museums between 1980 and 2016. He and his team also scoured sales held in 1,239 global auction houses from the same 36-year time period.\n\nThey used this data to help trace the paths that artists took early in their careers, tracking how one who earned a spot on the roster of Gallery A subsequently got exhibited in Museum B and then Museum C, for example. Dr. Barab\u00e1si analyzed the overlapping connections and mapped the institutions that proved key in helping the most artists succeed in the long run\u2014or not.\n\nThe result is a formula Dr. Barab\u00e1si said can predict which artists working now, based on their connections within this network, are more likely to become superstars.\n\n\u201cIf one of your first five shows as an artist is held at a gallery in the heart of this network, the chances of your ending your career on the fringes is 0.2%,\u201d Dr. Barab\u00e1si said. \u201cThe network itself will protect you because people talk to each other and trade each other\u2019s shows.\u201d\n\nSo who makes up the nucleus of this network? The list skews toward U.S. institutions like the Museum of Modern Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, the J. Paul Getty Museum and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. European museums include the Haus der Kunst in Munich and Tate in London. Dealers include Paula Cooper as well as galleries with multiple locations and sizable operations like Pace Gallery, Hauser & Wirth and David Zwirner.\n\nMagnus Resch, an economist who teaches at Columbia University and who helped Dr. Barab\u00e1si gather the data, said he was devastated by the findings because they suggest that myriad galleries outside this hub have little impact, no matter the quality of the art they show or sell.\n\n\u201cThe art world prides itself on being so open and inclusive, but the truth is the opposite,\u201d Mr. Resch said.\n\nThe study also maps out so-called islands on the network\u2019s periphery, populated by galleries and museums in places like Germany, Australia and parts of Asia that appear insular to a fault. For example, Germany is replete with noncollecting museums called kunsthalles that organize many shows featuring young artists, but Dr. Barab\u00e1si said his research revealed that few of these venues wound up swapping artists with the influential museums that ultimately determine an artist\u2019s success.\n\n\u201cThe conduit to bigger success isn\u2019t there,\u201d he said, though he conceded there were likely exceptions.\n\nThe network also benefits artists who live in cities with thriving art markets like New York and London. Of the artists tracked in the study who were born in the U.S., a quarter earned spots in highly prestigious venues, compared with 11% of artists in Canada and 9.2% of artists in India.\n\nThe network isn\u2019t defined solely by geography, though. Galleries physically located near MoMA weren\u2019t necessarily more influential than ones in San Francisco or Shanghai, the study found. In some respects, Dr. Barab\u00e1si said it mattered more for an artist to get a show at a major, encyclopedic museum like the Art Institute of Chicago than a buzzy, contemporary art museum.\n\nThat\u2019s because the Art Institute shows fewer living artists, and so it \u201chas more heft,\u201d he said. So far this year, the Chicago museum has opened shows featuring a dozen living artists. Last year, it showed eight.\n\nJames Rondeau, director of the Art Institute, said he remains skeptical of success metrics in the art world, but added that he wonders if the research could nudge curators out of ruts they might be in when it comes to scouring for talent.\n\n\u201cMaybe we can use it to give voice to those disenfranchised artists outside the trajectory,\u201d Mr. Rondeau said. \u201cWe need to use our eyes as much as our ears.\u201d\n\nWrite to Kelly Crow at kelly.crow@wsj.com", "PHILADELPHIA\u2014Traffic crawls along downtown\u2019s Chestnut Street, horns honking as cars block the intersection.
