The film, based on a widely admired 2014 book by Matt Bai, is framed as a cautionary tale\u2014here\u2019s the source of our current distress, the trivialization of politics by tabloid sensationalism. That\u2019s true, in a limited sense, and Mr. Hart\u2019s downfall may have had vast, if imponderable, consequences; what path might the nation have taken if he, rather than George H.W. Bush, had become president? Yet the production\u2019s shrill insistence on scandal-mongering as the poison of our political process is trivializing, too. Given the profound currents and countercurrents that have transformed\u2014and menaced\u2014the news media in the last few years, this story plays like quaintly ancient history.\n\nThe flawed hero\u2014Hart\u2019s talent for self-destruction figures prominently in the drama\u2014is played by Hugh Jackman. He manages to make the former Colorado senator both intriguing and emotionally remote, though the remoteness makes one wonder how well Hart, as portrayed here, would have fared in the Oval Office if fate, and the press corps, had been kinder. The director, Jason Reitman, working from a script he wrote with Mr. Bai and Jay Carson, whips up narrative action quickly and well. The best parts of the movie are the early, heady days of the campaign when the policy-wonk candidate articulates his ideas to a fast-talking, cross-chattering staff of idealistic young aides overseen by veterans with the expertise\u2014and useful skepticism\u2014to advance his cause. (J.K. Simmons is a charmingly acerbic operative named Bill Dixon. Hart\u2019s wife, Lee, played by Vera Farmiga, conveys a world-weariness all her own.)\n\nThere\u2019s also fun to be had in the circumstances, oft-recounted then and little-remembered now, that introduced Hart to Donna Rice (Sara Paxton), the model with whom he had an apparently romantic dalliance. Fun because the film works both sides of the street, as canny entertainments do, by relishing what it deplores, and because those circumstances were improbably provocative: Gary, having met Donna on a boat called Monkey Business, was wearing a T-shirt that said \u201cMonkey Business Crew\u201d when he was photographed with her dockside. (The script doesn\u2019t deal with a relatively new theory that their seemingly random encounter was a setup arranged by Hart\u2019s political enemies.)\n\nHugh Jackman Photo: Columbia Pictures\n\nWhere the movie goes clangingly wrong is in its account of the ravenous mob of reporters who tracked Hart down, staked him out and invaded every corner of his life as the first whiffs of impropriety turned into the sweet smell of circulation success. It\u2019s not that the mob wasn\u2019t ravenous\u2014by all accounts it was\u2014or sanctimonious and hypocritical; reporters in another time turned a blind eye to the sexual extravagances of JFK and LBJ. And it\u2019s surely not that a candidate\u2019s moral failings weren\u2019t fair game or don\u2019t remain so\u2014only that the depiction of the journalists and their heedlessly competitive editors (Alfred Molina as Ben Bradlee?) rings didactic and consistently false.\n\nThe filmmakers go out of their way to humanize Rice, and they do so affectingly, but the ink-stained wretches and electronic ferrets of the Fourth Estate are caricatures in a strident sermon. (That goes equally for the most interesting of the bunch, a Washington Post reporter, and composite character, named A.J. Parker. Although he\u2019s played with extraordinary grace and clarity by Mamoudou Athie, A.J. has still been constructed to illustrate, in parallel with Hart, the corruption of a good man.)\n\nWhat\u2019s missing from the sermon is a larger context. The press has always had a penchant for sensationalism; now that\u2019s raging at the intersection of politics and entertainment, where fans of scandalous news can\u2019t get enough of the addictive stuff. But \u201cThe Front Runner,\u201d like the book it was drawn from, has been overtaken by ominous events. Many sources of information on both sides of the political divide are inflaming their consumers by diluting news with ever larger infusions of opinion or outright propaganda, while the incorruptible and indispensable best of American journalism is besieged as never before in a war on the factual foundations of truth. A movie that doesn\u2019t distinguish between bad press and good press may be enjoyable, but it isn\u2019t helpful.\n\nWrite to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgenstern@wsj.com", "LAST MONTH, a Prussian-blue ballet slipper emoji made its debut on Apple\u2019s new operating system. Florie Hutchinson, a 38-year-old publicist, appealed to Apple for a flat-shoe emoji last year after discovering that when she typed the \u201ce\u201d of \u201cshoe\u201d into her iPhone keyboard, a red stiletto automatically popped up. She realized that all three women\u2019s shoe emojis featured heels, which didn\u2019t reflect her reality. \u201cI\u2019ve spent the past five years in the Bay Area,\u201d she said, \u201cand if you go outside and count how many high heels you see it\u2019s basically zero.\u201d\n\nThe new flat-shoe emoji more accurately reflects my own footwear choices, too. I was recently getting dressed for a full day that involved writing at a women\u2019s co-working space, a book party and dinner. I pulled on jeans and a top with feather-trimmed sleeves \u2014comfortable enough to hunch over my laptop but sophisticated enough for a cocktail party. For such a schedule, I\u2019d normally wear flats and stuff a pair of Manolo Blahnik BB pumps in my tote for later. But that day I hesitated: Why lug around stilettos that would bulk up my bag and then force me to teeter uncomfortably, when my Le Monde Beryl black velvet slides are just as lovely? I decided to put my (flat) foot down.\n\nBrands are offering a wider variety of flats than ever, elevating what was once a casual work alternative or a commuting shoe to one that\u2019s acceptable for more formal social occasions. According to NPD Retail Tracking Service, last year U.S. high-heel sales dropped 11% over 2016. Meanwhile, the selection of chic flats has become extraordinarily rich and varied. Whereas once vertiginous heels were the obligatory choice for events like weddings or panel presentations, today a dressed-up flat like the satin Balenciaga Slash slide fits in just fine. \u201cDesigners have been looking at bringing in more fashion, more trend, more design into a flat so it doesn\u2019t look like a basic but it becomes a special option,\u201d said Roopal Patel, fashion director of Saks Fifth Avenue. Flats are no longer the sad, casual Jan Brady to Marcia\u2019s superior heel; they can be equally fabulous, and comfortable to boot.\n\nTHE LOW LIFE / A Sampling of the Dressy Flats That Are Energizing the No-Heel Movement Clockwise from top left: THE FANCIFUL FANTASY Lace Flats, $945, Christian Louboutin, 702-818-1650; THE LUXURIOUS LOAFABOUT Velvet Venetian Slippers, $340, lemondeberyl.com; THE VINTAGE-Y VIXEN Tory Burch Loafers, $328, shopbop.com; THE ORNAMENTAL GEM Raffia Flats, $930, Salvatore Ferragamo, 212-759-3822 Photo: F. Martin Ramin/The Wall Street\n\nHigh heels originated as a way to help 10th-century Persian soldiers secure their feet in stirrups, before becoming the preferred shoe for 16th-century male European aristocrats eager to look taller and more formidable. Women soon adopted the style, and in modern times heels became inextricably linked with femininity. Like its early male adopters, I appreciate how a heel provides a lift. At 5\u20193\u201d (and a half!), I welcome any added height. Still, though a handsome pump has always made me feel polished and powerful, I\u2019m learning that the right flat shoe can do the same.\n\n\u201cWomen have always been wearing flats,\u201d said Ms. Patel. \u201cBut what we\u2019re starting to see is women wearing them from the minute they leave the house to the minute they come home. There is no shoe change any more.\u201d Lily Hanbury, co-founder of Le Monde Beryl shoes, argued that your footwear \u201cshould be chic enough to take you to anything you\u2019re going to that day.\u201d Ms. Hanbury launched her signature flat based on a traditional Venetian slipper in 2016, ideal for busy, style-minded women.\n\nWe\u2019re spending more time than ever on our feet these days, or at least being urged to. As standing desks prevail and Fitbits bully us to achieve 10,000 steps a day, comfortable footwear holds new allure. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing in the past few years is that women are more conscious of being healthful when it comes to their feet,\u201d explained Dr. Neal Blitz, a podiatrist with offices in New York City and Beverly Hills, Calif., whose website calls him \u201cThe Bunion King of New York.\u201d \u201cWomen just want to be active,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about looking good in heels any more.\u201d Shoe designer Tabitha Simmons, who counts her Hermione Mary Jane flats among her best-selling styles, would agree: \u201cEveryone was tottering around on platforms for such a long time that it swung the opposite way, and women started wearing more wearable footwear.\u201d\n\nTO THE POINT / The Sharp Toe Often Associated with Pumps Gives These Fun Flats An Edge Clockwise from bottom left: THE MINIMALIST MODSTER Metallic Silver Flats, $575, Alumnae, 212-774-7463; THE FEMININE FIND Tabitha Simmons Flats, $695, stylebop.com; THE SNAZZY STANDBY Striped Flats, $40, zara.com Photo: F. Martin Ramin/The Wall Street\n\nDress codes have also shifted in the age of #MeToo; when you\u2019re wearing heels, it\u2019s hard to lean in without toppling over. In 2016 when then-27-year-old Nicola Thorp reported for a temp job at PricewaterhouseCoopers in London, her supervisor told her heels were mandatory. After being asked to leave, Ms. Thorp started a petition protesting such archaic dress codes, which was investigated by two Parliament committees. The outcome: The temp agency Portico that demanded heels changed its rules, and calls were made for tougher laws against dress discrimination.\n\nShipley Salewski, 39, a San Francisco-based educator and consultant, recently stopped wearing heels to meetings of the mostly male charity board she chairs, replacing them with a rotation of dressy flats including magenta satin Delpozo mules and sparkly Malone Soulier ballerinas. \u201cThe flats I wear in that professional setting are definitely elevated flats, they\u2019re not boring flats. That\u2019s a distinction. I like beautiful things, I like to look like I tried and I also like to not fall over.\u201d\n\nGROUNDED LUXURY / High Heels Aren\u2019t the Only Designer Footwear Worth Splurging On From left: THE PLUSH PRIMADONNA Sequin Flats, $695, jimmychoo.com; THE ELEGANT EMINENCE Slingback Flats, $875, Chanel 415-981-1550 Photo: F. Martin Ramin/The Wall Street\n\nAs Ms. Salewski found, you needn\u2019t look dowdy in flats or like you forgot to switch into heels. While knee-length skirts look a smidgen too modest with flats, above-the-knee hemlines are charmingly cheeky. Opt for an ankle-cropped, slim style of pants; long, loose trousers double as a Swiffer duster. If you wear Mary Janes forgo the headband (too close to Eloise from the children\u2019s books); if you wear ballet slippers don\u2019t pull your hair into a bun (too on the nose).\n\nEarly in my career, an impeccably coiffed veteran colleague told me menacingly that she\u2019d never be caught dead toting flats in her bag. A bit hyperbolic, perhaps, but I agree that carrying two pairs of shoes appears indecisive and unwieldy, so I\u2019ve stopped throwing heels in my tote. When I wore my Le Monde Beryl flats on that jam-packed day, I was properly attired for the cocktail party but hit my 10,000-step goal on my way there, and didn\u2019t teeter on a single cobblestone. I used to be head over heels for heels, but now I\u2019m just over heels.\n\nAn Argument For Elevation\n\nIn which a confirmed stiletto-lover flatly refuses to change her ways\n\nIllustration: Neasden Control Centre\n\nABANDON MY HIGH heels? Not now, not ever. Tout the comfort of flats all you\u2019d like, but I refuse to relinquish the power, stature, and self-assurance my spikes afford me as a concession to \u201cpracticality.\u201d Who has ever aspired to be practical?\n\nOver the last decade or so, I\u2019ve amassed a small arsenal of towering shoes, their heels starting at 4 inches high. Each morning, I delight in surveying my cache and selecting my daily armor. No, I do not wear heels to attract the male gaze\u2014anyone who\u2019s seen my wardrobe of black tulle cocoons and conceptual, three-armed dresses can attest to that. Rather, my heels provide a mental and physical boost that makes me feel invincible.\n\nI\u2019m not alone in my adoration of elevated footwear. \u201cI feel rather dowdy and frumpy in invisible flats,\u201d said Linda Fargo, Bergdorf Goodman\u2019s SVP of Fashion Office and Store Presentation. \u201cHeels, even an inch, \u2018lift\u2019 me up.\u201d Dianne LaPointe Rudow, the director of the Zweig Family Center for Living Donation at Mount Sinai, wears them at least four days a week. \u201cI\u2019m short, so I like to be able to see eye to eye with my colleagues. And just because I\u2019m in a position of power doesn\u2019t mean I have to compromise\u2014women can be smart, successful, and feminine.\u201d\n\nMany have suggested that men invented heels to sexualize women and hold us back. That\u2019s not strictly true, as heels\u2019 origins as 10th-century equestrian wear prove. And while yes, heels are associated with erotic femininity (and so what?), Nancy Pelosi was no man\u2019s object when she wore four-inch blue suede stilettos last February to deliver a commanding, eight-hour, filibuster-style speech in defense of DACA.\n\n\u201cI love high heels because they give you confidence\u2014they give you an attitude, a way of walking, standing, and even sitting. You feel tougher and sexier,\u201d said Carine Roitfeld, editor in chief of CR Fashion Book. Ms. Fargo agreed: \u201cClothing and shoes are more than just a surface expression. We internalize what we\u2019re wearing and see ourselves differently, but to each her own. I\u2019m more of the ilk of effort. Effortless, easy style? I can\u2019t relate.\u201d Indeed.

PG -0.01% , General Motors Co. and Verizon Communications Inc.\n\nThe ANA study, which was conducted by corporate investigative firm K2 Intelligence, found rebates and other nontransparent practices were \u201cpervasive\u201d in the U.S.\n\nNow, in an industry white paper released Thursday, the ANA said if these practices are found to be fraudulent, \u201ccriminal charges can be brought against the media buying agencies and those executives and employees who were involved.\u201d\n\nThe report laid out federal crimes that it said are likely at the center of the investigation, such as mail and wire fraud, conspiracy and racketeering. The \u201cprimary\u201d offenses likely to be at issue are mail and wire fraud, the report said.\n\nThe 2016 ANA study found that ad agencies used the buying power of their clients for their own benefit. It found agencies\u2019 suspect practices included receiving cash rebates from media sellers for reaching spending thresholds and not returning those funds to clients.\n\nThe white paper said, \u201cIf two or more employees agreed to hide, divert or conceal earned rebates and cause a false report to be sent to an advertiser, a conspiracy may have taken place.\u201d\n\nA call to the American Association of Advertising Agencies wasn\u2019t immediately returned.

The typical formula: white walls, trophy art by trophy artists, and contemporary furniture from high-end brands that boasts little in the way of originality. That may satisfy some but not Lebanese-born decorator Claudia Skaff, who\u2019s based in London. \u201cI prefer interiors to have more character,\u201d she said. When she and her Dutch financier husband acquired this new 5,800-square-foot second home in the Gemmayzeh district to the east of the city, she was intent on one thing\u2014that it be endowed with personality and soul.\n\nCollaborating with Mich\u00e8le Chaya of local architecture firm Mariagroup, she injected a cozy conviviality into the blank-slate space by relying on patinated vintage furnishings, appreciably handmade light fixtures and wallpaper, and natural materials that warmed up the wan, by-the-numbers rooms.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a juxtaposition of things that don\u2019t necessarily go together,\u201d noted Ms. Chaya. Indeed, not everyone would pair a raw concrete wall with velvet tufted upholstery. Or decide that a reflective bubblegum-pink steel wardrobe should share quarters with a 19th-century Chinese altar table.\n\nTo give the space a grounding sense of place, meanwhile, the duo turned to traditional Lebanese touches, such as the handmade encaustic floor tiles. \u201cI didn\u2019t want the impression I was in Hong Kong or Paris,\u201d insisted Ms. Skaff. Here, five of the rooms that convey homeyness in adventurous ways.\n\nPhoto: Stephan Julliard\n\nA Vestibule That Welcomes Contrasts\n\nIn a newly constructed building just outside Beirut, homeowner Claudia Skaff, a decorator by trade, enlisted Mich\u00e8le Chaya, of local architecture firm Mariagroup, to give a standard luxury apartment individuality. The entry hall encapsulates the decorative principles by which they achieved this\u2014originality and daring. Flanking the door (on the right wall) are a chillingly modern free-standing closet of pink steel and a weathered antique Chinese altar table topped with a 1975 spherical sculpture by French ceramist Suzanne Tison\u2014one of the home\u2019s many feisty dialogues between old and new. Handmade wicker pendants from Thailand offer an earthy contrast to Mariagroup\u2019s cool steel bookcase.\n\nPhoto: Stephan Julliard\n\nHeritage Turned On Its Head\n\nTime-honored materials add a note of tradition in the kitchen. Ms. Skaff chose classic Carrara marble but fashioned it into sleek, straight forms. Ditto the cabinetry of solid oak, another well-established kitchen material, set in unconventional strips\u2014no raised-panel doors here. Handmade cement tiles from Beirut firm BlattChaya dazzle with motifs borrowed from historical documents. \u201cThey bring an authentic touch and immediately animate the floor,\u201d noted Ms. Skaff. Still, their palette of blue, greys and white is an update of the red-orange-ocher tile combos found in old Lebanese houses. Contemporary black accents\u2014Revolving Stools by Hay, a 1960s pendant lamp and the base of the table by Yew\u2014also thoughtfully undermine classicism.\n\nPhoto: Stephan Julliard\n\nInside Out\n\n\u201cI wanted to give the terrace more of a living-room atmosphere,\u201d said Ms. Skaff. Continuing the tile floor from the kitchen to the balcony links the inside and outside, while curvy forms help create a relaxed mood: The roundness of the stone-topped stainless-steel table echoes the circular motifs of the floor tiles; the contours of the iconic Eames fiberglass armchairs invite guests to kick back and linger.\n\nPhoto: Stephan Julliard\n\nTexture Message\n\nThe pair of design pros gave the cookie-cutter apartment energy and originality, mostly through unpredictable combinations. In the sitting room, the raw concrete wall offers an interesting backdrop for an adroit mix of the rough and refined. With its slightly prickly fibers, the abaca rug from Belgian firm Limited Edition adds another note of coarseness, while the custom velvet sofa and bronze coffee table ooze sensual luxury. Counteracting newness: midcentury finds, both well-known pieces (the Pierre Jeanneret armchairs and Vladimir Kagan sofa) and the more obscure daybed from Holland\u2019s Dick Cordemeijer.\n\nPhoto: Stephan Julliard\n\nBold Wallflower\n\nNothing gives a naked wall personality like wallpaper, and London maker Marthe Armitage\u2019s Angelica pattern provides a double dose of charm because it\u2019s hand printed for \u201ca very artistic look,\u201d said Ms. Skaff. The busy botanical motif is so strong that it more than keeps up with the potentially focus-stealing Jimken pendant from German industrial designer Ingo Maurer, which whimsically resembles a droopy cloth. Happily playing supporting roles: the clean-lined Roll & Hill Modo lamp and conspicuously unpatterned headboard, curtains and subtle Society Limonta bed linens.", "Count Rep.

We\u2019re all wired to process information in a certain way, but we get inundated with new information when traveling and end up focusing on the wrong things and making poor choices.\n\nWhat\u2019s happening more often, insurance officials say, is that travelers have grown more independent and more willing to take risks. Social media raises pressure on people to participate and show off pictures of amazing adventures. And the \u201cbleisure\u201d trend of mixing a vacation day or two into a business trip means some travelers think nothing of trying a day paragliding over a waterfall before a big sales conference.\n\nYour Travel Questions Answered Join WSJ editors and the Middle Seat columnist as they discuss the best and worst airports and answer your travel questions ahead of the busy holiday travel season, Nov. 15 at 1 p.m. ET.

Sometimes they overestimate the importance of something they know. There\u2019s a bandwagon effect for some people\u2014if others are doing it, it must be OK. Our blind spots become more pronounced when we travel, Mr. Daniel says, and sometimes we favor prior information over new evidence. (That neighborhood was safe when I was here 20 years ago.)\n\nAll that can lead to poor decisions. Among the worst International SOS has seen travelers make:\n\n\u2022 Deciding to go for $350 Lasik surgery in Vietnam. A bad outcome left two airline pilots unable to work.\n\n\u2022 Arriving jet-lagged to a corporate retreat and getting on a Segway for a \u201cteam-building\u201d tour.\n\n\u2022 Renting a car in a country with a high rate of road accidents. In most cases, you could hire a local driver for not much more.\n\n\u2022 Trying ultralight flying for the first time. Somehow when we\u2019re a tourist we think we can handle it even without proper instruction and training.\n\n\u201cA lot of times people get caught up in the moment,\u2019\u2019 says John Gobbels, chief operating officer of Medjet Assistance, a company that offers medical evacuation services. \u201cThat\u2019s why you travel, right? You want to experience things and have those experiences.\u2019\u2019\n\nRenting and using potentially dangerous vehicles without proper instructions is the No. 1 cause of injury when traveling, according to the travel-insurance division of American International Group: riding mopeds, participating in Segway tours, using jet skis for the first time.\n\nShared electric scooters like those from Bird Rides, here in Los Angeles, are popular with tourists, who may have little experience riding them. Photo: Mario Tama/Getty Images\n\nBikes and motorized scooters for rent in cities are inviting to travelers and they often jump on with neither helmets nor familiarity. \u201cWe see a good number of bumps and bruises and broken bones,\u2019\u2019 says James Page, AIG Travel\u2019s chief administrative officer who oversees assistance and claims.\n\nPeople who wouldn\u2019t consider them safe in their own neighborhood see a pack of riders somewhere on vacation, and it looks easy.\n\nAIG also sees claims from travelers seduced by pictures of people riding horses bareback through the surf at resort beaches. \u201cVery unathletic individuals think it\u2019ll be relaxing and easy,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Page says, \u201cand they go tumbling into the surf. That\u2019s kind of a common thing.\u2019\u2019\n\nAlso common\u2014and sometimes fatal\u2014these days: selfie injuries. Mr. Page says people trying to get their perfect angle fall off balconies, decks and piers, sometimes two or three stories up. Among the more exotic selfie accidents AIG has seen: tourists pose with a monkey in a tree behind them. The monkey jumps down and bites them.\n\nMr. Daniel of International SOS says ground transportation is among the top risks of injury to all travelers. In a country where vehicles drive on the opposite side of the road than at your home, you\u2019re programmed to look the wrong way for oncoming vehicles. People not paying attention get tripped by holes in pavement and curbs, or walk into alleys or even lanes of traffic. Others jump into a taxi and never put on a seatbelt.\n\n\u201cWe put down our guard,\u201d he says.\n\nThe best way to protect yourself when traveling is to build systems that give you consistency. If you\u2019re trying something new, do you always have a backup plan? If you know it takes you a day or two to adjust to a new time zone after crossing oceans, get in the habit of always waiting a day or two before you rent a car or hike up a mountain or ride a scooter.\n\nClaims related to sickness far outnumber injuries, travel-insurance companies say\u2014more trips get interrupted by heart attacks and various illnesses than accidents. But there are always plenty of falls down unfamiliar cruise-ship staircases and twisted ankles on cobblestone streets.\n\nInsurance experts note that in addition to exclusions for pre-existing conditions, many travel policies exclude coverage for extreme sports type activities. So ultralight flying, heli-skiing or even motorcycle riding might cancel coverage if you\u2019re injured. Companies do sell policies that include coverage for extreme sports, and if you plan to partake and buy travel insurance, you might want to get a policy tailored to your trip.\n\nGail Mangiante, claims advocate at InsureMyTrip, had a case of a college professor who suffered from neuropathy and knew his condition could be worsened by cold weather. He went hiking in the winter in the Alps in France\u2014and had to cancel the rest of his trip. Insurance refused to pay as the neuropathy was a pre-existing condition.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure that the average traveler is not thinking about these things. They are just thinking I\u2019m going on vacation, I\u2019m going to have a good time and I\u2019m going to do things I\u2019ve never done before,\u2019\u2019 Ms. Mangiante says.\n\nTop 10 Travel Accidents The travel-insurance division of American International Group compiled a list of the most common causes of accidents and injuries on the road. Renting and using vehicles such as mopeds, Segways, jet skis or scooters without proper instructions.\n\nDrinking alcohol: Falls cause numerous injuries, and poor judgement in any situation can lead to an accident.\n\nGoing beyond physical limits: If your knee hurts while walking the dog, it will hurt even more on when you attempt to cover Paris in one day.\n\nFalling during transfers on and off the tour bus, from dock to boat, etc.\n\nRiding or approaching animals.\n\nIgnoring existing medical conditions such as diabetes or high blood pressure.\n\nGetting ill. (Wash your hands, a lot.)\n\nTaking selfies: Watch where you walk and remember that circumventing safety measures to get better pictures can lead to injury.\n\nEating exotic cuisines that can cause stomach problems.\n\nEngaging in adventurous or strenuous activities with no experience\u2014rock-climbing, challenging hikes, zip lines.\n\nWrite to Scott McCartney at middleseat@wsj.com", "Matthew Whitaker, appointed acting attorney general on Wednesday after Jeff Sessions resigned, was a paid advisory-board member of an invention-promotion company shut down by federal regulators last year as an alleged scam.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission last year accused World Patent Marketing Inc., of Miami Beach, Fla., of scamming would-be inventors by charging them thousands of dollars to patent and promote their inventions.

Forever. This was no sister wife (he\u2019s faithful as a goose). James, it turned out, was in love with the idea of a 19th-century oil portrait. He\u2019d grown up spied on by an oil-on-canvas ancestor and felt that such an artwork gave any architecturally lackluster home an aura of peerage grandeur.\n\nTrouble was, I\u2019d never seen an antique portrait I could tolerate for long. Every ye olden person he pointed to at auctions and junk shops looked like someone who had been diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome before it was treatable. Who\u2019d want to live with that?\n\nDourness, I\u2019ve since discovered, was part of the tradition of posing. \u201cActually smiling [in a portrait] could be seen as breaking with decorum,\u201d said Sarah Moulden, curator of 19th-century collections at the National Portrait Gallery in London, who noted that by the 18th century, likenesses were common among the upper class and ascendant bourgeoisie.\n\nI spent hours scanning for The One on eBay, which currently lists 4,051 items under \u201cantique portrait,\u201d rejecting myriad contenders: a kindly bespectacled 1950s gran rendered in loose brush strokes; a Victorian woman in funerary garb, glaring as if I\u2019d stepped on her petticoat; a naively painted lad with a notably large head, in red breeches and knee-length jacket; 20th-century self-portraits of handsome, angsty young men. None charmed me.\n\nFrom left: Irish Lass Portrait, $759, onekingslane.com; \u2018Portrait of a Young Man\u2019 Circa 1950s, about $602, 1stdibs.com; 19th-century portrait of Joseph Doel, about $1,900, rubylane.com\n\nBut then, on assignment in Nebraska, I saw her, smirking at me from the clogged walls of Omaha\u2019s Antique Annex: Catharine S. Dennis, painted in 1843 and every bit the person I\u2019d accost for conversation at a cocktail party. She was regal\u2014her hairstyle unflinchingly center-parted, her full cartridge-pleated skirt nipped by a lace-up bodice\u2014but she was sassy. She looked like she was about to throw her head back and guffaw. If ancestry.com could be believed, she was born in 1811 in Yorkshire, England, and preserved at around my age. She wasn\u2019t destined to be ours, however: Catharine was priced higher than our mortgage payment, so I had to walk away. I felt like I\u2019d ghosted my best friend.\n\n\u201c Portraits add peerage grandeur to any home. \u201d\n\nOn my return to Denver, our house felt lonely without her, our d\u00e9cor predictable. A painted personage \u201cgives you that spunky, conversational weird vibe without trying too hard,\u201d said Nashville designer Stephanie Sabbe, who has cheerful college portraits from the 1950s in her upstairs hallway. In a client\u2019s home, she recently hung a collection of eight gold-framed women, captured in the early 1960s by Tennessee painter Lula B. Estes, above a tufted gray corner banquette. Still, said Ms. Sabbe of vintage portraits: \u201cThey\u2019re a card you can play exactly once,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t have them all over your house\u2014that\u2019s too much.\u201d\n\nNew York designer Thomas Jayne generally prefers to hang portraits in a gallery-wall array alongside, say, prints and antler mounts. Once, though, he made a large inherited portrait the linchpin of a one-bedroom apartment, hanging it alone and installing lavender and green curtains to match the subject\u2019s dress. \u201cPortraits have always been essential to the history of art, so if you ignore them, you\u2019re ignoring a lot,\u201d Mr. Jayne said, adding that they often cost less than a landscape of equal quality. And you can find options from every generation; portraiture has existed as long as humans have made art, Dr. Moulden said.\n\nMonths after I saw Catharine, I was still wishing I\u2019d spent the money and brought her home. So I convinced my husband to consider her my birthday present, called the shop that held her hostage and talked them down more than 30%. Catharine has now settled into permanent residence in our living room, where her crackled surface, moody colors and gilded frame do their part to lend a storied touch to our midcentury suburban house. Hanging above our entry table, she all but winks as guests cross the threshold, and she balances the adjacent sitting room\u2019s hodgepodge of mass-market modern pieces with a nod to classicism. Like all worthy visitors, she\u2019s more than a pretty face.
