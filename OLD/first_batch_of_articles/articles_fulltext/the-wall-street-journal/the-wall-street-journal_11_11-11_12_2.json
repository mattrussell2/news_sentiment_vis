A few days after the memorial service, when my daughters are cleaning out my closets, the doorbell will ring.\n\n\u201cWhere do you want this sofa?\u201d a delivery man on the porch of my Mill Valley, Calif., cottage will ask. \u201cYour mother ordered it a couple of weeks ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere must be some mistake,\u201d my daughter will say. \u201cWhy would a 100-year-old woman order a new sofa?\u201d\n\nThe delivery man will consult a clipboard: \u201cSays here she did specify rush delivery.\u201d\n\nYou are never too old to freshen up the living room. I will redecorate until I die. So should you. And I\u2019m not saying this simply because of what my family describes as a \u201cdiagnosed sofa problem.\u201d I\u2019m saying it because decorating is good for our mental health.\n\nEnvironmental psychologists, who study how physical space affects our well-being, know that different sofas will make us happy at various points in our lives. The foldout futon that made us feel so grown up in our first apartment gets replaced a few years later by a family-friendly sectional, which in turn gives way to a leather Le Corbusier three-seater that the grandchildren are absolutely not allowed to sit on in their bathing suits.\n\n\u201cPeople try to paint a picture of themselves in their surroundings,\u201d said Chicago-based psychologist Sally Augustin, author of \u201cPlace Advantage: Applied Psychology for Interior Architecture.\u201d \u201cAs you move through the stages of life, it\u2019s natural to want to redecorate to reflect those changes.\u201d\n\nWhen you see a room that looks like a time capsule from an earlier era\u2014whether it\u2019s a kitchen with 1990s granite counter tops or a den with wall-to-wall shag carpeting\u2014it makes you wonder if its owner is stuck in time as well.\n\nWe\u2019ve all had older relatives who stopped redecorating. A cautionary tale was my grandparents\u2019 1980s-era living room, which looked like a movie set from the 1950s: a lumpy, slipcovered couch that never moved an inch in any direction on the cut-pile carpet. A rickety bookshelf weighed down by a collection of hard-bound Reader\u2019s Digests. And a vacuum tube RCA Victor TV, hidden behind the double doors of a mahogany cabinet. No one had turned it on for years; when I was a child, if you wanted to watch television there was a portable set with rabbit ears in the kitchen.\n\n\u201c \u2018When you see a room that looks like a time capsule, it makes you wonder if its owner is stuck in time as well.\u2019 \u201d\n\nWhy didn\u2019t my grandparents redecorate? This wasn\u2019t about money, and besides, it costs nothing to rearrange furniture. In fact, they could have run a classified ad in the newspaper to sell the grand piano no one had played since my Aunt Vicki grew up and moved away. That would have opened up space to move my grandmother\u2019s plant stand, and 400 African violets, to a spot under the other window. It would have been refreshing.\n\nBut somewhere along the way my grandparents stopped seeing the possibilities. Or maybe no one told them redecorating could be fun. After all, when we talk about changing the design or d\u00e9cor in older people\u2019s homes, the discussion tends to focus on depressing topics like the need for grab bars in the shower.\n\nAt any age people should make decorating changes for aesthetic as well as for practical reasons. Our physical sense of color, smell and touch changes as we get older, which means things that looked and felt good to us when we were younger may not anymore. \u201cThe lenses in our eyes yellow as we age, so colors in spaces actually take on a tinge,\u201d Dr. Augustin said. \u201cWhen you paint the walls white and you\u2019re age 50, the color might look lovely and crisp. But to an 85-year-old, those same walls might look icky.\u201d\n\nThe solution? Paint the room a color that looks good to you, said Dr. Augustin. \u201cA small decorating change can be good for your mood or self-esteem.\u201d\n\nMy personal decorating hero, and friend, is someone who embodies this philosophy. Doris Fingerhood, a Manhattan-based interior designer who is 90 years old, got her start in the business in the 1940s and hasn\u2019t stopped decorating since. Soon after she arrived in Brooklyn as a World War II refugee, she fixed up her aunt and uncle\u2019s basement (on a budget of about $12) to make a space where she could have her teenage friends over.\n\nThese days, most of the business of her firm (which she named Doris LaPorte Associates after marrying her first husband 69 years ago), is to help clients redecorate homes whose interiors she originally designed decades ago.\n\nHer approach to decorating has changed as she and her longtime clients have aged. But her frugality is prized even more by people whom she\u2019s worked with for many decades. \u201cIf the design was a thoughtful job and not a quickie, you can keep the bones,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes a new piece of furniture or a painting is all a room needs to change the whole look.\u201d\n\nHowever, she cautioned, be ruthless about updating worn-out rugs, upholstery, and drapes. \u201cReplace anything that looks old or seedy, because your home is a reflection of your own personality,\u201d she said.\n\nMs. Fingerhood recently freshened up the Park Avenue living room of a client she\u2019s had for more than 40 years. It only required a few tweaks. \u201cShe had antiques and good pieces she still liked, so all we did was reupholster the sofa and get a new Oriental rug,\u201d she said. \u201cI think since the rug was so much more beautiful than the old one, it changed the whole room. Also we got new throw pillows, and that made a big difference.\u201d\n\nMy own living room could use a few tweaks. \u201cI think my sofa is starting to look worn and seedy,\u201d I confided to her. \u201cBut then I always think I need a new sofa.\u201d\n\n\u201cI liked the one you had in your apartment when you lived in Manhattan,\u201d she said, \u201cbut if it doesn\u2019t work in California, give it away and get a new one.\u201d\n\n\u201cGive it away?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cEasiest thing in the world, you always know someone who needs furniture,\u201d she said. \u201cSend me some photographs of the room and we\u2019ll work from there.\u201d\n\n\u2014Ms. Slatalla is an editor for remodelista.com which, like The Wall Street Journal, is owned by News Corp.", "British Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s plans for a Brexit deal with the EU look more precarious than ever.\n\nWith less than 20 weeks until Britain\u2019s planned departure from the European Union, it isn\u2019t clear whether any agreement she negotiates with the bloc would secure the support of her own cabinet, let alone the U.K. Parliament.\n\nThat means...", "Chefs and restaurateurs talk about the harsh work culture and stigma of mental illness in their industry.

Photo Illustration/Video: Natalia V. Osipova/The Wall Street Journal\n\nWhen television personality and former chef Anthony Bourdain killed himself in June, Charles Ford, the general manager of a high-end restaurant in Chicago, took the news as a personal call to action: He would no longer be silent about his three suicide attempts.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to hide it anymore,\u201d says Mr. Ford, 31, who says he slashed his wrists on three occasions between late 2015 and spring 2016. Workers with suicidal impulses and other emotional crises often hide their pain in his profession, Mr. Ford says. \u201cWe need to do everything we can to turn this around, and the first step is saying it out loud.\u201d\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t want to hide it anymore,\u2019 Charles Ford, general manager of S.K.Y. restaurant in Chicago, says of his past struggles. Photo: Natalia V. Osipova/The Wall Street Journal\n\nMr. Ford is one of many for whom Mr. Bourdain\u2019s suicide was a reckoning with the dark side of the $800-billion restaurant business. Insiders have long worried privately about the lifestyle of people who work in the restaurant industry, which has one of the highest rates of illicit drug use and alcoholism and a tradition of masking mental-health struggles. A number of groups have begun exploring why the business has these problems and what might be done about them. The death of Mr. Bourdain\u2014an idol for many in the culinary world\u2014has given these efforts greater urgency.\n\nThrough Mr. Bourdain\u2019s literary manager Kimberly Witherspoon, the late chef\u2019s family declined to comment for this article.\n\nThe brutal nature of restaurant-kitchen culture is part of the problem, many in the industry say. Physical and emotional toughness is prized and workplace conventions like 40-hour workweeks, breaks and professional courtesy can be foreign concepts. At the same time, young people raised watching \u201cTop Chef\u201d and Food Network now enter the profession with high expectations\u2014and debt loads\u2014once rare in this largely blue-collar field.\n\nJessica Largey, 32, in September opened her own restaurant, Simone, in Los Angeles. Throughout her career, she has been on the receiving end of extreme behavior in kitchens and has also dished it out, she says. Years ago, in a rage, a chef threw a plate of food across the kitchen that crashed over her work station and ruined what she was preparing, she recalls. Working 12- to 16-hour days and insecure as a young chef, she herself yelled at colleagues who failed to meet her standards of perfection. \u201cWhen I first became a chef, I was so stressed because I was so young,\u201d she says. \u201cMy reaction was one of anger.\u201d\n\n\u2018When I first became a chef, I was so stressed because I was so young,\u2019 says Jessica Largey, who recently opened her own restaurant, Simone, in Los Angeles.

Osipova/The Wall Street Journal\n\nJust over 15 million people\u2014roughly 10% of the U.S. workforce\u2014are employed in some part of the restaurant industry, according to the National Restaurant Association. The industry\u2019s long hours, intense work, high stress and scarcity of employer-subsidized health insurance are all classic contributors to mental and behavioral health problems, says David Ballard, the head of the American Psychological Association\u2019s Center for Organizational Excellence.\n\nQuantifying mental-health struggles is difficult. Many studies track diagnosed disorders, which means they only cover people who have sought professional treatment and likely had insurance to cover it, he notes. However, a growing body of studies and surveys point to greater-than-normal struggles in the restaurant business. Employees in accommodations and food services were found to have the highest illicit drug use compared with 18 other occupational sectors, broadly covering the U.S. workforce, in a study published in 2015 by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. They had the third-highest heavy alcohol use, after miners and construction workers.\n\n\u201cWe are dealing with an epidemic of mental illness in our industry,\u201d says Cat Cora, a 51-year-old chef with nine restaurants around the country who has been a fixture of food television and magazines. Of Mr. Bourdain, she says, \u201cHe was the last person people thought would commit suicide.\n\n\u2018We are dealing with an epidemic of mental illness in our industry,\u2019 says Cat Cora, a chef who has been a fixture of food television and magazines. Photo: Mark Von Holden/Invision for James Beard Foundation/AP Images\n\nOrganizations from large trade groups to individual restaurateurs have launched efforts to support restaurant workers. In July, the National Restaurant Association started a health plan in partnership with UnitedHealthcare that offers medical and mental-health coverage. The American Culinary Federation, which has 14,800 members, rolled out a group health-insurance program for members for the first time this year, says Renee Brust, director of marketing and communications. Unilever Food Solutions, a unit of Unilever that serves the restaurant trade, in May started \u201cFairKitchens,\u201d an initiative aimed at changing the culture that includes a code of conduct for restaurants to sign onto.\n\nWhen John Hinman, owner of Hinman\u2019s Bakery in Denver, became a pastry chef in the mid-1990s, he learned through a tradition of apprenticeship. Many restaurant kitchens are run in a strict hierarchy where rising within a pyramid structure confers the right to dominate those beneath. \u201cIt\u2019s brutal, the berating that goes on. You had to be tough. You had to be able to take it,\u201d Mr. Hinman says.\n\nJohn Hinman, owner of Hinman\u2019s Bakery in Denver, in May co-founded a group called CHOW that hosts weekly gatherings for industry members to talk about stress management. Photo: Annette Slade Photography\n\nThe food industry often draws non-conformist, Type-A perfectionists attracted to the unusual hours and the camaraderie of a kitchen crew, he says. However, that spirit can lead to an unhealthy partying lifestyle. Mr. Hinman, a recovering alcoholic, in May co-founded a group called Culinary Hospitality Outreach & Wellness\u2014CHOW, for short\u2014which hosts weekly gatherings for industry members to talk about coping mechanisms and stress management.\n\n\u201cDrinking into oblivion traditionally was a badge of honor\u201d in many restaurants, says Steve Palmer, founder of Indigo Road Restaurant Group, with 16 locations in the Southeast. Mr. Palmer was an alcoholic and cocaine addict for the first half of his career, until getting sober in 2001. \u201cIt was petrifying,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t know anybody who was sober in the restaurant business.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, Mr. Palmer co-founded Ben\u2019s Friends in Charleston, S.C., a group for restaurant workers to gather and talk about substance abuse. It is named for Ben Murray, a chef friend who killed himself that year after a long struggle with alcoholism, Mr. Palmer says. Ben\u2019s Friends chapters have arisen in Raleigh, N.C., Richmond, Va., Atlanta and in Minneapolis, he says.\n\nThe food industry\u2019s higher profile over the past decade, stoked by food-themed television programs, has helped increase professionalism, Ms. Largey says. At her new restaurant, she aims to provide manageable work schedules, promote civil behavior, and train new managers to be humane leaders. \u201cNone of the staff is allowed to drink at the restaurant,\u201d she says.\n\nOn the other hand, young cooks\u2019 heightened expectations don\u2019t always take into account low wages or difficult labor, restaurateurs say. Dreams of fame and fortune have driven growth in culinary schools and programs and encouraged thousands of students to finance this education with debt.\n\nLast year, 672 culinary programs were accredited by the ACF, compared with roughly 100 in 1998, Ms. Brust says. More than 39,000 students matriculated from two-year or four-year culinary degree programs accredited by the ACF last year. Yet the Bureau of Labor Statistics forecasts the creation of only 14,100 new chef and head-cook jobs by 2026. There will be 10 times as many \u201ccook\u201d jobs, but these pay half as much.\n\nRestaurant cooks make a median wage of $12.10 an hour, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Culinary-school graduates are no exception, even at top-tier restaurants in expensive cities, a number of restaurateurs say. While some top chefs can earn six figures, the median annual wage for chefs and head cooks is $45,950, according to the BLS.\n\nJacob Funk, a sous chef at the Vig in Chicago, says that after graduating in 2014 from the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, N.Y., he carried $65,000 of debt, with a $700 monthly payment. His first several line-cook positions, in Boston, Charleston and Chicago, paid between $10 and $14 an hour. To cover his cost of living, he worked overtime, and throughout his career has routinely worked 60- to 84-hours a week.\n\nWith $65,000 in debt after graduating from culinary school in 2014, Jacob Funk says he has routinely worked 60- to 84-hours a week to cover his cost of living. Photo: Natalia V. Osipova/The Wall Street Journal\n\nThis summer, after spending many nights sleepless and finding himself trembling during his shift, terrified of making a mistake, he sought help from a therapist.\n\nMr. Ford, the Chicago general manager, says his suicide attempts happened at a time when his relationship with a girlfriend was ending and he felt very lonely. The stress of his first job as a general manager at a restaurant where 70- to 80-hour weeks were typical, added to his hopelessness.\n\nAfter he cut his wrists for the second time, on a Saturday night, he got up the next morning and worked a 12-hour shift, he says.

Published by G.P. Putnam\u2019s Sons in August, it has sold over 290,000 copies in print, digital and audio formats, the company said, and drawn comparisons to the work of novelist Barbara Kingsolver.\n\nIn its first eight weeks, its sales exceeded those of several of Putnam\u2019s other best-selling debuts, its editor Tara Singh Carlson said. The book has spent nine weeks both on the New York Times best-seller list and Amazon\u2019s most-sold fiction chart.

Since 2004, food manufacturers in the U.S. have been required by law to label eight major allergens on their packaging: peanuts, tree nuts, milk, eggs, fish, shellfish, wheat and soybeans\u2014but not sesame. By contrast, packaged foods in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Europe already must include sesame on labels.\n\nSophie Schmults, now 13, was diagnosed with a sesame allergy when she was a baby. Photo: Anne Schmults\n\nNow, the FDA is in the first stages of considering adding sesame to the list. Last month it issued a request for information on sesame to learn more about the prevalence and severity of sesame allergies, as well as the food industry\u2019s thoughts on the issue before taking regulatory action. The FDA is accepting comments on its proposal through the end of the year.\n\nEight of 22 major food companies don\u2019t regularly disclose sesame on U.S. packaging labels, according to a 2017 survey conducted by the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a Washington, D.C.-based consumer advocacy group that has submitted a petition to the FDA to add sesame to the list of required disclosures. Fourteen companies said they carry at least one brand in which they do declare sesame as an ingredient and don\u2019t include it as an undisclosed \u201cspice\u201d or \u201cnatural flavoring.\u201d But only two post their policies clearly on their websites; the others provide information upon request.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Grocery Manufacturers Association, a trade association that represents the food industry, says the group hasn\u2019t yet taken a position on the proposal. The group is reviewing it and is slated to have a meeting about it this week.\n\nThe danger of sesame allergies gained attention after a teenage girl died in 2016 from an anaphylactic allergic reaction that started while on board a British Airways flight, the Associated Press reported. She had eaten a sandwich she bought at the airport that contained sesame that wasn\u2019t labeled, AP said.\n\nThe family of a teenager who died from an anaphylactic allergic reaction to sesame that started while on board a British Airways flight.

CSPI has submitted the data to the FDA in addition to its original petition.\n\nSarah Sorscher, CSPI\u2019s deputy director of regulatory affairs, hopes that if the FDA adds sesame it will pave the way for other common allergens. Mustard is a likely next target for U.S. food allergy advocates, says Robert Wood, a pediatrics professor at Johns Hopkins University and president of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology. Canada and Europe already require mustard disclosure.\n\nBruce J. Lanser, a pediatric allergist at National Jewish Health in Denver, says he supports the move to include sesame on food labels. \u201cWe certainly think it\u2019s necessary and warranted and support it,\u201d says Dr. Lanser.\n\n\u201cMy sesame patients are probably the ones who have the most accidental exposures,\u201d adds Dr. Lanser. \u201cAs few as two sesame seeds can trigger a reaction for some patients. It doesn\u2019t take much either for cross-contamination.\u201d\n\nSesame can be in a lot of surprising things, he notes, such as candy corns that include sesame oil. Tahini is sesame and is often in hummus. Restaurants often aren\u2019t aware even if sesame flour or oil is in a product being used in cooking.\n\nTahini is sesame and is often in hummus.

Once it was from breadcrumbs used in chicken tenders at a restaurant, and in another case it was likely cross-contamination from take-out pizza, says her mom. In both cases, the family had checked beforehand with the restaurants to see if there was sesame in the food. (While requiring that sesame is included on packaged-food labels wouldn\u2019t directly affect restaurants, it would have helped in the case of the chicken tenders because the chef in that case didn\u2019t know the breadcrumbs used for the tenders had sesame hidden under \u201cspices\u201d in the label, says Ms. Schmults.)\n\nAfter the incidents, Sophie says she\u2019s had a lot of anxiety around food, even foods she\u2019s eaten all her life.\n\n\u201cThe fact that she had these two incidents really close together really made us more vigilant than ever,\u201d says Ms. Schmults. \u201cAll we want is to just be able to read the label and know what\u2019s in the food.\u201d\n\nWrite to Sumathi Reddy at sumathi.reddy@wsj.com", "The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled more than 600 points Monday as anxiety over the health of technology behemoths sparked a broad retreat from the stock market.\n\nMonday\u2019s selling began in the technology sector, then morphed into a rout that dragged lower everything from oil conglomerates to manufacturers to entertainment firms.

However, due to their cost, one type, known as PCSK9 inhibitors, should be prescribed only when the other, a generic medication, doesn\u2019t work, the guidelines said.\n\nThe recommendations were released at the American Heart Association\u2019s annual scientific conference and update a sweeping overhaul of the way doctors should determine a patient\u2019s risk of cardiovascular disease.\n\nThat document, released in 2013, abandoned an easy-to-use recommendation to keep LDL, or bad cholesterol, below 100 or below 70 for people at high risk. Instead, it urged physicians to use a broader calculation of risk\u2014a step that some physicians say caused confusion.\n\nThe new guidelines urge physicians to do even more to personalize the decision as to whether a patient needs a cholesterol-lowering drug.\n\nThat means taking into account heart disease in the family, whether a patient has diabetes, whether he or she is of an ethnicity considered to be at higher risk, such as South Asian, and other factors, on top of more traditional measures such as the results of a cholesterol test.\n\n\u201cRisk is more of a process than a calculation,\u201d said Donald Lloyd-Jones, chair of the department of preventive medicine at Northwestern University and a member of the panel that wrote the guidelines. \u201cWe can help personalize the decision.\u201d\n\nNearly one in every three American adults has high levels of LDL, the AHA says, which contributes to buildup of fatty plaque and narrowing of the arteries. Research shows that people with LDL of 100 or lower have lower rates of heart disease and stroke, according to the AHA.\n\nWhen a patient\u2019s risk level isn\u2019t clear, a coronary artery calcium scan can help determine whether treatment is needed, the guidelines recommend. The test, which is like a CT scan, measures calcified plaque in the coronary arteries. While the test exposes patients to radiation, it is about the same as a mammogram, Dr. Lloyd-Jones said.\n\nThe guidelines restore some benchmarks for physicians. For example, they recommend prescribing a drug on top of statins when a patient\u2019s LDL cholesterol is 70 or above despite the statin.\n\n\u201cThey filled in a lot of the blanks,\u201d said Amit Khera, a reviewer of the guidelines who is director of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center\u2019s preventive cardiology program.\n\nEzetimibe, a low-cost generic drug, may be given to patients at high risk of a heart attack or stroke if statins don\u2019t work, the guidelines said. Only if Ezetimibe doesn\u2019t work should patients be prescribed a PCSK9 inhibitor\u2014a class of drugs shown to be highly effective in lowering the cholesterol of patients whose LDL is 100 or more.\n\nThe panel said PCSK9 inhibitors\u2019 high cost makes treatment with the drugs worthwhile only for a small number of high-risk patients.\n\nThat guidance acknowledges a current market reality. Insurers have placed restrictions on paying for the drugs, due to their cost. Many require patients to try other treatments and have their doctors submit reams of paperwork proving their need for the drug.\n\nAs a result, many patients who are prescribed one don\u2019t get it, makers of the drugs say. On Saturday, they welcomed the inclusion of their drugs in the guidelines.\n\nAmgen Inc. noted that it slashed the list price of its PCSK9 inhibitor, Repatha, by 60% last month to $5,850 a year. Since then, five large statewide and national plans have adopted the lowered price, an Amgen spokeswoman said.\n\nRegeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Sanofi SA, maker of Praluent, said in March they would reduce the U.S. net price of the drug to a range of $4,500 to $8,000 annually per patient, down from a list price of $14,600.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re optimistic that the new guidelines will enable more patients to benefit from Praluent and are eager to continue collaborating with stakeholders,\u201d Regeneron and Sanofi said Saturday.\n\nSeparately, researchers presented results of a trial of 8,179 patients showing that Vascepa, a drug derived from an Omega-3 fatty acid in fish oil cut the risk of cardiovascular death, heart attack and other events in study subjects by 25%. That included a 20% lower risk of cardiovascular death. The drug reduces levels of triglycerides rather than LDL cholesterol. The patients in the trial were on statins and had a wide range of triglyceride levels.\n\nAmarin Corp. , maker of the drug, will apply to the Food and Drug Administration in early 2019 for approval to market it for heart disease prevention, said John Thero, Amarin\u2019s president and chief executive officer.\n\nWrite to Betsy McKay at betsy.mckay@wsj.com", "WASHINGTON\u2014Congress returns this week for the final two-month stretch that is expected to be dominated by a fight over spending and immigration and a power struggle over the special counsel\u2019s Russia probe.\n\nIn the wake of Tuesday\u2019s elections, Democrats\u2019 coming takeover of the House means each party has reasons to compromise this year and reasons to hold out.

(Nov. 9, 2018)\n\nWrite to Rachel Pannett at rachel.pannett@wsj.com", "As the days get darker earlier and outside temperatures get cooler, you may have considered doing some gardening inside your home. Houseplants can be healthy additions to almost any environment, and many thrive indoors. One expert, Brie Arthur, a certified horticulturalist and author based outside Raleigh, N.C., digs into the roots of plants specifically bred for indoor living.\n\nMuch noise has been made around a NASA study that claimed certain houseplants act as powerful indoor air filters. But many botanists and horticulturalists say the study overstated the chemical-cleansing benefits of indoor plants.\n\nEither way, Ms. Arthur says, plants do have many excellent advantages, like turning carbon dioxide into oxygen, beautifying the environment and teaching the value of nurturing something that isn\u2019t yourself. \u201cWhen you care for a plant, you build a relationship with it,\u201d says the plant lecturer and author of \u201cThe Foodscape Revolution.\u201d\n\nThese plants--clockwise from top left, a spider plant, peace lily, pothos vine and Swiss cheese plant--need limited maintenance and are perfect for beginner indoor growers. Photo: iStock (3);Shutterstock\n\nNatural Selection\n\nMany of the plants that are sold for indoor growing are native to rain forests or other densely foliated regions where they get very little light and experience almost no seasonal temperature changes. Such hardy species have been bred for generations to be less likely to defoliate when introduced to slight shifts in temperature or humidity, and to do well in home environments.\n\n\u201cSpider plants, peace lilies, Swiss cheese plants and the super-popular pothos vine are well-adapted for indoor life, whether they have a lot or a little direct sunlight,\u201d the horticulturalist says. Pilea peperomioides seems to be the hot indoor plant right now, she says.\n\nMany houseplants can do fine with the light from a regular lightbulb and very little direct sunlight, Ms. Arthur says. A dry home is also good, since too much moisture can cause mold. Succulents like aloe are the easiest plants for indoor growers, especially those who travel a lot or who forget to water their plants. Ms. Arthur has some 400 of them in her home. \u201cWhat ever you do, resist the urge to water them,\u201d Ms. Arthur says. Even the moisture in the air of a sealed-up apartment is enough for these drought-tolerant plants, she says.\n\nPilea peperomioides are a popular indoor choice, says horticulturalist Brie Arthur. Photo: Shutterstock\n\nPlants release oxygen during the day. When the sun sets or the lights go out, photosynthesis stops. However, there are a few oddballs, including some orchids, bromeliads, succulents and snake plants, that release oxygen at night, making them great for placing in a bedroom, Ms. Arthur says, since oxygen levels in the blood tend to lower during sleep. \u201cLive houseplants are also relaxing,\u201d she adds. Ferns thrive in hot, moist conditions, so they work well in bathrooms, she notes, while succulents can live happily in a dark corner.\n\nGetting Started\n\nMs. Arthur recommends picking a plant that you like the look of, and not spending too much. She suggests purchasing a self-watering planter or using a plastic insert with holes that drain water. Plant the roots in soil in these containers before putting the houseplant into a decorative pot. \u201cThose pots can pool water, and no houseplants like to sit in standing water or they\u2019ll rot,\u201d she says. Overwatering is the most common cause of death of houseplants.\n\nMs. Arthur recommends cleaning each leaf with a wet cloth regularly to prevent dust buildup, \u201cwhich I find very Zen,\u201d she says. Should fungus gnats turn up\u2014\u201cthey are a universal problem and come out of nowhere, like fruit flies,\u201d she says\u2014sweep them off the surface of the soil with your fingers, rather than using a pesticide that may bring unwanted toxins into the home.\n\nThe leaves of the desert and Tropics-dwelling aloe vera create a gel that soothes burns. Photo: iStock\n\nMs. Arthur employs a weight test to determine if a plant requires water.\n\n\u201cPick the pot up and feel how heavy it is. Once you do it a little while, you\u2019ll know what is too heavy and when it needs a drink,\u201d she says. She doesn\u2019t believe touching the soil for dampness is good enough, since the top layer may be dry while the soil below remains damp. If it feels light, take the plastic insert out of the pot and place the plant under a sink tap. Let it drain before putting it back into the pot.\n\n\u201cThe trouble is that plants have the same symptoms\u2014leaves turning brown or wilting\u2014from two opposite issues: overwatering or underwatering,\u201d she says. But with practice, a brown thumb can turn green. \u201cEven horticulturalists kill plants,\u201d she says. \u201cThe good news is, houseplants aren\u2019t expensive, and a dead plant is just an excuse to go out and buy more, so keep indulging.\u201d", "ABU DHABI\u2014Plummeting oil prices and signs of a coming global oversupply are bringing producers closer to a pact to cut output.\n\nSaudi representatives said Sunday that the kingdom would slash its exports unilaterally next month, as a broader OPEC alliance debated\u2014but didn\u2019t agree to\u2014a collective production cut.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia, the world\u2019s...", "SAN FRANCISCO\u2014Firefighters are battling two deadly California wildfires that have claimed at least 31 lives, left more than 200 people missing and put a quarter million residents under evacuation, while unhealthy smoke levels have prompted warnings to stay indoors.\n\nThe Camp Fire in Butte County, about 100 miles north of Sacramento, grew slightly to a total of 109,000 acres on Sunday, after destroying an estimated 6,500 homes and 260 businesses, mostly in the city of Paradise.

Every year, millions gather in churches or public squares\u2014or take part in somber parades\u2014to commemorate not merely the 900,000 or so British and Empire men who died in 1914-18 but also the British war dead since. For the two weeks or so leading up to the day, an imitation poppy\u2014the flower of Flanders, where most of the British losses in the Great War were suffered\u2014is widely worn. It is a sober, moving day, a fixture in the national calendar.\n\nThe original Armistice Day, as Guy Cuthbertson shows in \u201cPeace at Last,\u201d was very different from the current Remembrance Day. It was characterized by striking contrasts. On the Western Front, the morning started as usual, with continued small-arms and artillery fire as the Allies made their final \u201cpush.\u201d The last British soldier to be killed in action was George Edwin Ellison, a middle-aged man with the Royal Irish Lancers who fell at Mons, in Belgium, near where he had been involved in some of the first fighting at the start of the war in August 1914. His death, like those of the other men who were killed on the war\u2019s last couple of days, has often been described as futile, because the combatant countries had by then agreed on a precise timetable for the cessation of fighting. In fact, hostilities continued up to the last hour to ensure that the Germans did not wriggle out of their armistice obligations, which were effectively terms of surrender.\n\nPhoto: WSJ\n\nPeace at Last By Guy Cuthbertson\n\nYale, 293 pages, $27.50\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nThen, at 11 a.m. on Nov. 11\u2014the now fabled 11th hour\u2014the armistice came into effect. In one famous incident on the Western Front, a German machine gunner fired off his last belt just before the clock struck, then stood up, bowed and withdrew in the direction of home. An \u201cuncanny\u201d silence, as Mr. Cuthbertson puts it, descended on the war\u2019s many battlefields\u2014the inspiration for the two minutes of silence that are part of the modern commemoration of the day.\n\nAt home, by contrast, the end of the war brought an eruption of noise that lasted until the following morning and beyond. In Portsmouth, thousands of officers and men, as well as members of the Women\u2019s Royal Naval Service\u2014the \u201cWrens\u201d\u2014broke into a full 10 minutes of wild yelling. There was as yet no BBC, so the news spread in fits and starts. Across the United Kingdom crowds, often including wounded servicemen, streamed into town squares and city centers. At one end of the spectrum, there were the official proclamations and the countless church services. The royal family appeared on the balcony of Buckingham Palace. Afterward, George V, who had abjured alcohol for the duration of the war, took \u201ca cup of kindness\u201d while the Windsors, as they had been called since 1917 (instead of their original Germanic name), sang \u201cAuld Lang Syne.\u201d At the other end of the spectrum, there were high spirits, drunkenness and (it seems) a lot of celebratory sex.\n\nAmid the rejoicing, there was also terrible sadness. One couple in Doncaster, Yorkshire, received news of their son\u2019s death at the front more than three weeks before. Others remembered those who had not returned or who had been horribly maimed. Once the euphoria had worn off, relief and exhaustion were the dominant sentiments, not least because, as the author reminds us, Britain\u2014and indeed the world\u2014was in the grip of an influenza pandemic that would claim many lives and sap the energy of the survivors.\n\nBut it was also a time of hope. Many thought that the Great War was, as British Prime Minister David Lloyd George had said, the war to \u201cend all wars.\u201d Children were named for the peace. One of these was Pax G. Yates of Chertsey (about 30 miles west of London), who was born at exactly 11 a.m. on Nov. 11, 1918.\n\nIt was only in later years that Armistice Day acquired its ritualized sobriety. In his absorbing and well-researched study, Mr. Cuthbertson, a professor of literature at Liverpool Hope University, shows how a day of spontaneity was tamed over time, as celebration morphed into commemoration. The exuberance of Armistice Day gave way to the solemnity of Remembrance Day. What was being marked was no longer the end of the war but the full experience of the conflict, and in time of all the recent wars in which the British Empire and the United Kingdom were involved (a long and growing list).\n\n\u201cPeace at Last,\u201d despite its sometimes grim subject, is a pleasure to read and is full of fascinating tidbits. Did you know that Capt. Harry Truman, the future president, was serving on the Western Front on Nov. 11 and fired his last shot 15 minutes before the armistice, which he celebrated by eating a blueberry pie? Probably the last man to die in the war, at one minute to 11 a.m., was also an American, Henry Gunther from Baltimore; the author does not add that he was the grandchild of German immigrants. A crowd in Maidstone, Kent, started singing \u201cRule Britannia\u201d but found that nobody knew more than the first few lines and so continued with the more widely known \u201cKeep the Home Fires Burning.\u201d\n\nAs one might expect from a literary scholar, Mr. Cuthbertson marshals an impressive range of literary sources, from Vera Brittain\u2019s \u201cTestament of Youth\u201d to James Joyce\u2019s \u201cFinnegans Wake\u201d (which, he says, presents the \u201cmangled speech\u201d of drunken armistice revelers); from Thomas Keneally\u2019s novel about the armistice negotiations, \u201cGossip From the Forest,\u201d to Horton Foote\u2019s play \u201c1918.\u201d There is even a disquisition on armistice and the rituals and traditions of bell ringing.\n\nMarshal Foch, the Supreme Allied Commander, said that what was achieved in 1918 was \u201cnot peace, but an armistice for twenty years.\u201d This turned out to be a surprisingly precise prediction. There was unfinished business in Europe. Hitler led Germany, which had convinced itself that it had not really been beaten \u201cin the field,\u201d back into war in September 1939. Seaman Pax Yates was killed in action off Narvik, Norway, on May 3, 1940, age 21.\n\nMr. Simms is the author of \u201cEurope: The Struggle for Supremacy, From 1453 to the Present.\u201d", "On the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month in 1918, the guns were stilled in what was then the bloodiest war in history.
