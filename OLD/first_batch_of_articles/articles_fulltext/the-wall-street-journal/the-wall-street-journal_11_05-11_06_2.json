Now the 52-year-old says he pulls steady 40-hour workweeks for a taxpayer-financed housing program that repairs damaged residences.\n\nHis wages have nearly doubled, too, thanks to a new minimum-wage law enacted last summer by Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossell\u00f3, coupled with a surge in demand for construction labor across this struggling U.S. territory. Mr. C\u00f3rdoba spent his summer days fixing roofs and windows and installing toilets, wash basins and cabinets in houses mostly in eastern Puerto Rico, where Hurricane Maria first made landfall.\n\nThe construction workforce, estimated at roughly 33,000 before Hurricane Maria, will need to double to keep up with demand to rebuild roads, houses and other infrastructure damaged in last year\u2019s storm season, said Emilio Colon-Zavala, president of the Puerto Rico Builders Association. Cement sales, a proxy for construction activity, increased for eight months straight after Hurricane Maria to 33% above prestorm levels.\n\nPuerto Rico\u2019s building industry is booming, fueled by federal disaster-relief dollars and insurance proceeds together projected to total $82 billion over time. The influx has turned construction into a bright spot for an island economy racked by population loss, a declining manufacturing base and the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history.\n\nSince the hurricane, federal agencies have obligated $4.8 billion for recovery work in Puerto Rico through last August, according to the Center for a New Economy, a San Juan-based think tank. While financial planners don\u2019t know the exact scale of federal assistance over the next decade, the U.S. government has made some firm commitments already, including an $18.5 billion grant for rebuilding housing and other infrastructure.\n\nMeantime, the construction industry is reckoning with rising costs. Not only have wages increased, but material costs have risen since the Trump administration imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum from Canada, Mexico and the European Union and on Chinese products like home appliances, electrical equipment and other materials critical to Puerto Rico\u2019s rebuilding efforts.\n\nPuerto Rico relies heavily on Chinese imports, and 72% of those products are subject to new or additional tariffs implemented this year, according to KPMG LLP, a trade and customs consultancy.\n\nCostlier labor and supplies are upending financial projections and potentially shrinking the number and size of feasible projects, said Stephen Spears, president of the Associated General Contractors of America\u2019s Puerto Rico chapter.\n\nPuerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 argued that raising construction workers\u2019 wages would coax laborers into the building industry at a time when it badly needed them. Photo: Carlos Giusti/Associated Press\n\n\u201cIf you have a $100 million project, you now have a $135 million project,\u201d Mr. Spears said. \u201cAll of a sudden, those dollars that were estimated and delegated to us for the reconstruction of the island are going to have much less impact.\u201d\n\nGov. Rossell\u00f3, through an executive order in late July, raised the minimum hourly wage on government-funded construction to $15 an hour from $8.25. He argued the move would coax laborers into the building industry and persuade workers to stay in Puerto Rico rather than migrate to the mainland U.S.\n\nIn August Puerto Rico\u2019s oversight board said the new minimum wage could \u201cleak into the broader economy\u201d and apply to work that isn\u2019t covered by federal taxpayers, \u201cmaking it more costly to undertake the vast amount of private reconstruction required on the island and likely reducing employment of construction workers for private projects.\u201d\n\nContractors and developers say the new wage level also risks slowing the completion of vital repairs. The governor\u2019s order will raise overall construction costs by between 8% and 20.5% and contribute between 0.5% and 1.2% to overall inflation, according to San-Juan based economic consultancy Estudios T\u00e9nicos. Puerto Rico\u2019s oversight board expects inflation to stay below 1.6% through the 2023 fiscal year.\n\nHigher costs mean fewer projects completed each year and a \u201csmaller and weaker private construction sector when the federal funds eventually run out,\u201d according to an Estudios T\u00e9nicos study commissioned by Puerto Rico business groups and reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. One government project to improve roads in western Puerto Rico will cost 24.75% more because of the new wage mandate, Estudios T\u00e9nicos found.\n\nWhile Puerto Rico\u2019s $15 hourly floor applies only to public construction, both supporters and critics say the effects could extend to the private sector, forcing small businesses\u2019 to raise wages to retain workers and potentially compelling some to consolidate.\n\nYet raising the minimum wage enjoys significant popular support in a territory where construction laborers earned a median hourly wage of $8.69 last year compared with $13.79 in Florida, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nEdison Severino, an organizer for the Laborers\u2019 International Union of North America, or Liuna, said a higher minimum wage was necessary to encourage people who work in the large underground economy or have given up looking for employment to rejoin the formal labor force.\n\nPuerto Rico\u2019s labor participation rate hovers around 40%, lower than the Dominican Republic\u2019s and the overall U.S. rate of 63%.\n\n\u201cYou need to motivate people to work,\u201d Mr. Severino said. \u201cYou\u2019re not incentivizing people to get up and work if what they make is so minimal.\u201d\n\nWrite to Andrew Scurria at Andrew.Scurria@wsj.com and Julie Wernau at Julie.Wernau@wsj.com\n\nCorrections & Amplifications\n\nKPMG LLP is a trade and customs consultancy.

Immigration, an issue President Trump has pushed in the last leg of the midterm elections, came in at No. 2, with 23%. The economy and jobs rounded out the early results at the No. 3 spot.\n\nIn many areas, voters had to wait more than an hour to cast their ballots.

Steady rain fell Tuesday across Virginia and Pennsylvania, home to several key congressional battles, as well as New York, and was expected to intensify, possibly affecting turnout.\n\nMany voters said Tuesday that their views of Mr. Trump drove their decisions at the polls. In Missouri\u2019s St. Charles County, outside St. Louis, retiree Bill Craig and his wife, Marilyn, said they cast ballots specifically to add to the momentum behind Mr. Trump and the Republican party.\n\nAs the 2018 midterms heat up, both Democratic and Republican candidates are positioning themselves as outsiders who will change the status quo.

Mr. Trump has made several trips to the Sunshine State hoping to bolster Republicans and taking particular aim at gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum, the Democratic mayor of Tallahassee, who got a visit from former President Obama last week.\n\nFrom the moment polls opened at 7 a.m., a steady stream of voters arrived at the Aquilina C. Howell Center in Tallahassee. They were a diverse demographic mix\u2014black and white, young and old.\n\nHarold Ford, a 76-year-old African-American retired counselor, said he voted for Mr. Gillum. \u201cHe\u2019s not afraid to say he\u2019s liberal,\u201d said Mr. Ford, a registered Democrat. But \u201che\u2019s not penned in by his politics. He will reach across the aisle to get things done.\u201d\n\nOther voters in Florida had mixed feelings. Neil McAdorey, 54, is a lacrosse coach at Parkland High School in Florida, where a gunman opened fire on students in February, killing 17 people. Mr. McAdorey said he traditionally leans Republican, and voted for Mr. Trump in 2016. He declined to say whom he favored this year but lamented the country\u2019s increased political polarization.\n\n\u201cWe need to bring back what was great about America, which was that we were united,\u201d he said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been strongly united in the last year and a half and really even before that.\u201d\n\nAnd despite low unemployment and an uptick in growth, Mr. McAdorey said the economy also weighs heavily into his thinking. \u201cI have two sons who are entering the workforce and I am very concerned about the opportunities available for them and concerned about jobs,\u201d he said.\n\nIn Ohio, another battleground state Mr. Trump visited Monday in his final campaign swing, there is a heated governor\u2019s race after 2016 GOP presidential candidate John Kasich is leaving due to term limits. Republican Mike DeWine faces Democrat Richard Cordray in the race to follow Mr. Kasich.\n\nBrian McBurney, 61, said he traditionally votes Democratic in his hometown of Massillon, Ohio, but has grown more conservative with age\u2014motivated by issues including tax cuts, health care and immigration. He said he plans to vote Tuesday for Mr. DeWine and Republican incumbent Rep. Bob Gibbs in Ohio\u2019s Seventh Congressional District.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re better off\u201d with Mr. Trump as president,\u201d Mr. McBurney said. \u201cI don\u2019t agree with everything he does, but I think we\u2019re better off with him than we would have been with (Hillary) Clinton.\u201d\n\nOther contests to watch include races in Indiana and Kentucky, the states where the first returns are expected at 6 p.m. Eastern Time.\n\nAmerica Speaks: Why Voters Went to the Polls The Wall Street Journal asked voters around the country one question: \u201cWhy did you come out to vote today?\u201d Here is what they said.

The more distant from civilization\u2019s myriad distractions, they reasoned, the better one\u2019s chances of a prolonged one-on-one with God. And so, it\u2019s believed, in the early 500s an Irish ascetic named Fion\u00e1n (later known as St. Finnian of Clonard) and a handful of like-minded brethren headed for a life of devotion, struggle and solitude on Skellig Michael, a precipitous hunk of rock rising from the Atlantic off the coast of County Kerry, Ireland.\n\nMillennia later, Luke Skywalker, who had the entire solar system to choose from, also selected Skellig, known in cinematic terms as Ahch-To, as his refuge in \u201cStar Wars: The Force Awakens,\u201d calling it \u201cthe most unfindable place in the galaxy\u201d and giving moviegoers a glimpse of its wild terrain. For those craving isolated me-time, Skellig Michael has a long history of obliging.\n\nSkellig Michael has made cameos in Star Wars movies. Photo: WALT DISNEY PICTURES/LUCASFILM/ALAMY\n\nMr. Skywalker, arriving by spacecraft, had an easier time of it than Fion\u00e1n\u2019s brethren and the groups of a dozen or so other monks thought to have lived on the Skellig (from scaelig, Irish for \u201crock\u201d) at any one time up to the 12th century. They made the trip to what George Bernard Shaw called \u201cthis impossible rock\u201d in currachs, wooden row boats lined in hides. Considering the aggressive seas and turbulent weather in those parts, simply arriving intact would have been miraculous. But what these men accomplished during their stay is mind-boggling. The beehive-shape stone housing and oratories (small chapels) that remain, despite Viking invasions and centuries of wind and storms, are remarkable feats of design and durability.\n\n\u201c The views on the climb to a monastic site are gobsmacking: ocean crashing, crags piercing an illuminated sky. \u201d\n\nDespite my undeniable Irish composition (red hair, freckles, affinity for leprechauns) I\u2019d never set foot on the Emerald Isle. The remoteness of Skellig Michael and its testament to the extremes humankind will go to appeal to a higher power prompted me to finally make the trip. With the help of Naomi Sheehy of Ireland Luxury Travel, I booked a seat on the Skellig Walker, a recently built 38-foot boat built to ferry tourists between Portmagee, a cheery tourist-dependent town on the Wild Atlantic Way, and the island.\n\nThe September morning of our departure was sunny and clear, but large swells at Skellig Michael\u2019s landing point were prohibitive and the trip was canceled. This isn\u2019t uncommon, so it\u2019s advisable to plan on spending a few days in the neighborhood. The following day, the sea had settled and I joined other ancient-monastic-site enthusiasts, including a couple who\u2019d come in Star Wars regalia. Fifteen boat operators are granted licenses to ply the roughly hourlong route to the Skellig between May and October, with a maximum of 12 passengers each. The rock\u2019s 2015 Star Wars cameo ratcheted up interest\u201417,000 visited the Unesco World Heritage site last year, an increase of about 5,000 from 2015. In response to concerns that Skellig Michael may be over-trampled, when it came time to film \u201cThe Last Jedi,\u201d a replica of the monastery\u2019s ruins was recreated further north.\n\nAs we motored out past Bolus Head, the westernmost tip of the Iveragh Peninsula, the water was choppy and the winds full. After about an hour we came to the Little Skellig, a companion rock (larger than Michael despite the name) covered in some 39,000 cacophonous pairs of northern gannets who live beak-by-jowl on a rock-face shimmering with their guano. As their swoops and calls faded behind us, the twin pinnacles of Skellig Michael loomed.\n\nA colony of gannets on Little Skellig. Photo: Alamy\n\nWe disembarked (a little dance with the swells is required when stepping from boat to dock) and listened to a guide give a brief talk about the island\u2019s history. Then we set off to climb at our own pace.\n\nSix hundred rough-edged stone stairs, placed centuries ago, ascend at a steep incline to the remains of the Skellig\u2019s original monastic site. (A later hermitage, accessed by a death-defying path, is closed to the public.) The climb isn\u2019t particularly strenuous, but it\u2019s daunting. There are no railings to offer a handhold once you\u2019re past a short stretch at the base. One step at a time is a good mantra until you acclimate. After that you\u2019ll be able to lift your gaze enough to notice the grass stretched over the rocklike layers of pool-table felt, the pock marks signaling rabbit warrens and puffin burrows, and the gobsmacking views\u2014ocean crashing, crags piercing an illuminated sky, the wind a whooshing soundtrack. Assuming heaven is up, one can imagine the monks felt a lot closer from here.\n\nYour Travel Questions Answered Join WSJ editors and the Middle Seat columnist as they discuss the best and worst airports and answer your travel questions ahead of the busy holiday travel season, Nov. 15 at 1 p.m. ET.

A cluster of six beehive-shaped stone cells and an oratory comprise the main grouping, along with the ruins of a medieval church constructed later. On a further terrace sits another oratory. The buildings, aside from the church, were made from stones quarried from the top of the skellig and laid without mortar\u2014arduous and exacting work.\n\nThe church, whose building materials were likely brought by boat from Valentia Island (a mind-boggling chore) is flanked by burial sites. One is filled with weatherworn stone crosses whose rounded forms suggest creatures from another world raising their arms in witness and protection. Even before the Vikings posed a threat\u2014they kidnapped and killed the Skellig\u2019s abbot in 824 A.D.\u2014this area was considered the edge of the western world, the frontier before the dark side. Whatever spirit was imbued in those cemetery crosses had to be ever vigilant.\n\nAfter a talk from another resident guide, we were left to wander for an hour or so, imagining what it would be like to call this tip of sandstone home.

The week of sales starts on Sunday and could shake up price levels for dozens of top artists.\n\nSotheby\u2019s, Christie\u2019s and smaller house Phillips have been riding high all year long, spurred by surging collector confidence in everything from wine to Wassily Kandinsky. This ebullience enticed heavyweight collectors like British billionaire Joe Lewis, Denver fund manager Tom Marsico and former Merrill Lynch chief executive John Thain to consign pieces into these fall sales of impressionist, modern and contemporary art.\n\nChristie\u2019s, which is selling works by the three men, declined to discuss the consigners\u2019 identities. Messrs. Lewis, Marsico and Thain didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nJacob Lawrence\u2019s 1947 painting \u2018The Businessmen\u2019 comes up at Sotheby\u2019s on Wednesday with an estimate of $1.5 million to $2 million. Photo: Sotheby's\n\nMr. Thain, who once oversaw the New York Stock Exchange, is asking Christie\u2019s to help him get at least $25 million on Sunday for his 1931 Pablo Picasso, \u201cThe Lamp.\u201d Mr. Marsico has asked the same house to sell his 1917-19 Claude Monet \u201cWater-Lily Pond\u201d for at least $30 million. Mr. Lewis has put the biggest price tag of the series\u2014$80 million or more\u2014on his David Hockney painting coming up for sale at Christie\u2019s on Thursday, 1972\u2019s \u201cPortrait of an Artist (Pool With Two Figures).\u201d\n\nYet consignment deals are typically signed months ahead of their sales. Market conditions can shift in the interim, altering the mood of potential bidders.\n\nTom Mayou, an art adviser with the London firm Beaumont Nathan, said he is \u201csensing jitters\u201d in recent weeks that could compel some bidders, particularly those in mainland China, to sit on their paddles. \u201cI\u2019m not forecasting doom and gloom, but the selling environment this fall feels very different from a year ago,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a big risk that the Chinese won\u2019t show up at all.\u201d\n\nChinese collectors\u2019 participation matters because their purchasing power has buoyed auctions of trophy art for nearly a decade. During a similar set of fall auctions last year, Sotheby\u2019s credited seven Asian bidders for taking home half of the priciest pieces in its impressionist and modern-art evening sale\u2014including one buyer who went on a $70 million spending spree.\n\nLast month, during a series of sales in Hong Kong, Sotheby\u2019s said participation from mainland Chinese bidders fell 14% compared with the year before, hurting its sales of jadeite and traditional Chinese paintings. Last week in a call with investors, Sotheby\u2019s Chief Executive Tad Smith noted the decline of mainland Chinese bidders and said the market next year could be a \u201cbit more subdued.\u201d\n\nAsian collectors in nearby Taiwan, Singapore and Indonesia are angling to fill in the gap, but these buyers are mainly drawn to international modern and contemporary art, said David Chau, a Shanghai collector who co-founded the city\u2019s art fair, Art021, which opens Thursday. These buyers also appear to be more comfortable splurging for art in the $500,000 to $5 million range, rather than the $25 million-plus trophy market.\n\n\u201cThe mainland Chinese were just not prepared for the bumps in our economy like the collectors in Taiwan and Singapore,\u201d Mr. Chau said. \u201cPeople have money\u2014they\u2019re just shifting it around.\u201d\n\nIn New York, expect the houses to play up pieces that come from estates, because these tucked-away works tend to appeal to collectors seeking fresh or pedigreed material. The heavyweight set this fall comes from luxury travel executive Barney Ebsworth, who died in April and whose 90-piece, $260 million estate includes Willem de Kooning\u2019s \u201cWoman as Landscape,\u201d estimated to sell for at least $60 million, and Jackson Pollock\u2019s \u201cComposition With Red Strokes,\u201d priced to sell for at least $50 million.\n\nAnother big group comes from the estate of David Josefowitz, a Ukrainian who made a fortune selling mail-order vinyl records and vitamins before he died in 2015. His collection of Fauvist works, estimated to sell for at least $92 million, will kick off Sotheby\u2019s impressionist and modern-art sales on Monday and Tuesday.\n\nHere are six key works to track as test cases for the fall auctions\u2014and the market\u2019s trajectory overall.\n\nEdward Hopper, \u2018Chop Suey,\u2019 estimated to sell for $70 million to $100 million. Photo: Christie\u2019s Images Ltd.\n\nEdward Hopper\n\nThe going rate for a bowl of Chinese stir fry was around 40 cents in 1929 when American modernist Edward Hopper painted \u201cChop Suey,\u201d but Christie\u2019s will aim to sell this sunlit restaurant scene from Mr. Ebsworth\u2019s estate for between $70 million and $100 million on Tuesday.\n\nThat\u2019s a big step up from the artist\u2019s $40.5 million auction record, set five years ago. MutualArt, an art data and analytics firm based in London, said that if the painting achieves its low estimate, it will eclipse Hopper\u2019s best-selling year, 2013, when sales of his works totaled $64.6 million.\n\nChristie\u2019s expert Alex Rotter said the rarity of Hopper\u2019s paintings, and the resurgent interest in overlooked American artworks from the first half of the 20th century, led the house to give it \u201ca masterpiece estimate.\u201d\n\nErnst Ludwig Kirchner\u2019s \u2018Artillery Men\u2019 carries a $15 million estimate. Photo: Sotheby's\n\nErnst Ludwig Kirchner\n\nErnst Ludwig Kirchner\u2019s 1915 \u201cArtillery Men\u201d depicts the horror and anonymity the German artist felt during World War I basic training. After suffering a nervous breakdown, he was discharged.\n\nThe work, which Sotheby\u2019s aims to sell for at least $15 million on Monday, could get a boost, because earlier this year it was restituted from the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and Foundation to the heirs of Jewish dealer Alfred Flechtheim. Kirchner\u2019s record is another restituted work, \u201cBerlin Street Scene\u201d from 1913-14, that sold at Christie\u2019s for $38.1 million, over its $24 million high estimate, in 2006.\n\nThe soldiers-in-the-shower subject matter of the coming example could prove a turnoff, though. \u201cIt\u2019s important, but it\u2019ll put off 95% of the collecting public,\u201d Mr. Mayou said. Sotheby\u2019s expert August Uribe disagrees, saying the work\u2019s angst could attract \u201cpeople who collect Francis Bacon.\u201d\n\nJacob Lawrence\n\nCollectors have pushed up prices for contemporary black artists like Kerry James Marshall, but what about Jacob Lawrence, an earlier chronicler of the African-American experience whose $2.5 million auction record has sat, unchallenged, for more than a decade? Lawrence\u2019s \u201cThe Businessmen\u201d from 1947 could prove a contender when it comes up at Sotheby\u2019s on Wednesday carrying an estimate of $1.5 million to $2 million.\n\nLawrence already appears to be having a banner year. Two of his works sold earlier this year for $475,000 combined, more than all his paintings resold for at auction between 2013 and 2017, according to MutualArt. The firm said his works are also currently in at least nine exhibitions across the U.S. and the U.K., a sign of curatorial favor.\n\nArt adviser David Norman said it makes sense to put Lawrence in a contemporary sale, but the move will also test the breadth of interest in recalibrating African-American artists.\n\nAlberto Burri\u2019s \u2018Big Wood and Red\u2019 is expected to fetch at least $10 million at Phillips on Thursday. Photo: Phillips\n\nAlberto Burri\n\nThe market has fluctuated for postwar Italian art, with plateauing prices for minimalist artists like Piero Manzoni, known for his folded white abstracts, and Lucio Fontana, who made slashed canvases his signature. But Alberto Burri\u2019s 1950s abstracts are harder to sum up, and that may prove a boon.\n\nBurri burned, crackled and stitched his compositions together, and they\u2019ve shown up in greater numbers, and valuations, over the decade, according to MutualArt. His 1957-59 \u201cBig Wood and Red\u201d is estimated to sell for at least $10 million at Phillips on Thursday.\n\nDavid Hockney\n\nAt age 81, David Hockney has been getting the elder statesman treatment lately, with multiple museum shows and a reappraisal at auction. Sotheby\u2019s reset the bar for the British transplant to Los Angeles when it sold his cheery 1990 landscape, \u201cPacific Coast Highway and Santa Monica,\u201d for $28.5 million in May. Now, three paintings and seven works on paper are headed for sale, including his 1972 \u201cPortrait of an Artist (Pool With Two Figures),\u201d which Christie\u2019s will aim to sell Thursday for around $80 million.\n\nIf it surpasses $58.4 million, Mr. Hockney will reset Jeff Koons\u2019s record for most-expensive artwork ever auctioned by a living artist\u2014but the jury is still out among dealers and art advisers on whether this example merits the title. Mr. Mayou said bidding for trophies has proved thinner this year than last, and that makes the Hockney \u201ca little vulnerable.\u201d\n\nMr. Rotter at Christie\u2019s said the painting has all the elements of the artist\u2019s best-known works\u2014it\u2019s a large, double portrait that contains a mountainous, desert landscape and a swimming pool.\n\n\u2018Clean Slate,\u2019 a 25-foot-tall KAWS sculpture, is estimated to sell for at least $900,000. Photo: Phillips\n\nKAWS\n\nNew York artist Brian Donnelly, professionally known as KAWS, started out in the 1990s as a graffiti artist turned toy maker, but he is getting a blue-chip market push this fall.\n\nOn Wednesday, Heritage Auctions is selling a KAWS toy collection amassed by collector Ronnie Pirovino that\u2019s estimated to go for at least $141,400, followed the next day by the opening of a solo show at his New York gallery, Skarstedt. At least eight examples of KAWS\u2019s cartoonish Everyman figures will be also be offered across the major houses\u2014including a 25-foot-tall sculpture at Phillips, \u201cClean Slate,\u201d estimated to sell for at least $900,000.\n\nThe record for KAWS is the $1.3 million paid at Sotheby\u2019s last month for \u201cAgain and Again,\u201d a portrait evoking SpongeBob SquarePants, but market watchers say his sculptures typically outperform his paintings at auction. So far this year, MutualArt said 64% of the sculptures offered at auctions sold within or above their estimates, compared with 46% of his paintings.\n\nWrite to Kelly Crow at kelly.crow@wsj.com", "Stephen Curry is one of the many NBA players who spent the formative years of his life playing a completely unrealistic videogame called \u201cNBA Jam.\u201d\n\nThere was something universal about how people behaved once they grabbed the controllers. It didn\u2019t matter where they lived or how old they were or whether they would eventually become the greatest shooter on earth. What they had in common was the way they played the game. They did everything in their power to take as many 3-pointers as possible.\n\nThis was odd. In the actual NBA at the time, 3-pointers accounted for 8% of total points. But on any given \u201cNBA Jam\u201d machine, that number was between 50% and 52%, said Mark Turmell, the game\u2019s creator. It turns out all those people were onto something: 30% of points scored in the NBA now come from 3-pointers, and that rate has steadily increased every single year for the last three decades.\n\nThe way the NBA reflects \u201cNBA Jam\u201d is uncanny but not unusual. So many of the innovations that have revolutionized professional sports in recent years are the same intuitive strategies that people have been using for as long as arcades have existed.\n\nNBA teams are playing faster and shooting more 3-pointers. NFL teams are passing more. MLB batters are trying to smash as many home runs as possible at the same time MLB pitchers are trying to rack up as many strikeouts as possible.\n\nSports have become videogames.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nThe most sophisticated front offices that use complicated proprietary algorithms to allocate their mountains of cash have come to a surprising conclusion about optimal strategies. The evolution of sports has led them right back to their childhood basements.\n\n\u201cYou just do what works,\u201d said Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey. \u201cIt\u2019s basic logic.\u201d\n\nIn 1993, the same year teenagers started feeding quarters into \u201cNBA Jam\u201d machines, NFL teams weren\u2019t exactly known for their strategic innovation. At the time, 9% of offensive snaps came from the shotgun position, and only 54.9% of offensive plays were passes, according to Stats LLC.\n\nThere was always one group of people with a keen understanding of how backward NFL teams were. These people loved football and spent hours every day consumed by it. Except they were on their couches.\n\nAnybody who has played the Madden videogame franchise instinctively knew how to be effective on offense: pass the ball.\n\nPassing the ball averaged more yards. So did plays out of the shotgun. These gamers sensed that running the ball with your quarterback under center, to obey traditions that dated back to leather helmets and a time when the forward pass wasn\u2019t even legal, was nothing short of lunacy.\n\nJordan Powell, a top Madden gamer, found himself exasperated whenever he turned on television and watched the NFL. The strategies he saw professional coaches implementing simply weren\u2019t smart.\n\n\u201cIt annoyed me,\u201d says Powell.\n\nNFL coaches are finally coming around. Passing in professional football now accounts for an all-time high 60% of plays. And that\u2019s still lower than the 69% of Madden users, according to EA Sports data.\n\nPowell is more encouraged by some of the other decisions he sees these days, like NFL teams going for it on fourth down and attempting more 2-point conversions, which might as well have been illegal a few years ago.\n\n\u201c You just do what works. It\u2019s basic logic. \u201d \u2014Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey\n\nIn one area, reality has surpassed virtual reality. Madden quarterbacks use the shotgun for 53% of plays in the game. NFL quarterbacks have used the shotgun on 63% of plays this year, and that has allowed quarterbacks like Patrick Mahomes to put up never-before-seen numbers in this record-breaking NFL scoring season.\n\nThe passing boom in the NFL has coincided with a scoring explosion in the NBA. The pace of basketball hasn\u2019t been this fast since the mid-1980s, and it\u2019s accelerated so much so quickly that the fastest teams a decade ago would be the slowest teams today. Not since the mid-1970s has the NBA seen this many points per game. And it\u2019s not simply because there are more possessions. It\u2019s also because offenses have never been as efficient as they are right now.\n\nIn a strange and unexpected twist, to understand today\u2019s NBA, you almost have to study \u201cNBA Jam.\u201d\n\nThe average \u201cNBA Jam\u201d machine was remarkably consistent, Turmell said. In any given arcade, about 75% of total points came from dunks, layups and 3-pointers, the most valuable shots in basketball. That number in the real-life NBA is now up to 64%.\n\n\u201cNBA Jam\u201d was beloved in part because it was absurd. And now the NBA has almost reached \u201cNBA Jam\u201d levels.\n\n\u201c\u2019NBA Jam\u2019 was ahead of our time,\u201d said Nidal Nasser, a gamer for the Portland Trail Blazers\u2019 team in the NBA 2K League, \u201cand we didn\u2019t even know it.\u201d\n\nIn the 2015 version of \u201cNBA 2K,\u201d the videogame of choice for today\u2019s NBA players, 34% of shots came from behind the 3-point line, according to the company\u2019s data. The Warriors won the championship that year by shooting 31% of their field goals as threes. But then something funny happened the next season. As the 3-point attempt rate in \u201cNBA 2K\u201d dropped to 29%, Golden State\u2019s increased to 36%. The Warriors were more futuristic than the videogame.\n\nLeBron James and Kyle Kuzma learned how to play with each other in part by playing the NBA 2K videogame. Photo: robert hanashiro/Reuters\n\nNo less an NBA influencer than LeBron James became familiar with the Lakers by playing with them on \u201cNBA 2K.\u201d He even taunted his opponent for slipping underneath a screen and daring Lonzo Ball to shoot. He didn\u2019t seem to mind that his opponent was a computer.\n\nNot every NBA player tries to find strategic advantages when playing \u201cNBA 2K.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a LeBron thing,\u201d said Oklahoma City Thunder forward Paul George.\n\nBut that means it\u2019s now a Lakers thing. James\u2019s teammate Kyle Kuzma has become so serious about the craft of \u201cNBA 2K\u201d that he considers the hours he spends playing to be a form of high-level training.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a virtual simulation,\u201d Kuzma said. \u201cIt\u2019s no different than pilots flying fake airplanes.\u201d\n\nThe time he spends practicing videogames might be one possible explanation for the scoring outburst in the NBA this season. And one of the players off to the best start of his career is none other than Stephen Curry. He\u2019s once again putting up silly numbers that aren\u2019t supposed to exist in reality.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like this,\u201d New York Knicks coach David Fizdale said. \u201cExcept on a videogame.\u201d\n\nWrite to Ben Cohen at ben.cohen@wsj.com and Andrew Beaton at andrew.beaton@wsj.com", "Unfilled jobs in the U.S. exceeded the number of unemployed Americans by more than one million as the summer came to a close, a sign it is increasingly difficult for employers to find workers.\n\nThere were a seasonally adjusted 7.01 million job openings on the last business day of September, the Labor Department said Tuesday.

The Los Angeles couple went to a local Sephora to choose some purposeful-sounding goop\u2014a house-brand Green Clay Mask ($8 each), which purports to purify and minimize pores\u2014and made a night out of it. The 31-year-old film producer, a skin care novice with an oily complexion, saw positive effects immediately and has since gone on to purchase masks on his own.\n\nFor many men, the idea of spending 15 minutes plastered in a damp, papery sheet mask or sealed in the grips of a gritty clay mask is becoming less alien. Tara Foley, CEO and founder of Follain, a skin care chain with stores in Dallas, New York and Seattle, has seen an uptick in converts who start by borrowing masks from their partners, then buy their own. Alex Penfold pilfered from his wife Jen\u2019s mask stock for years before creating the \u201cBro Mask,\u201d an emphatically male-marketed sheet mask that\u2019s larger to envelop a man\u2019s broader face and comes in two parts, so bearded men can skip the bottom part and avoid getting the sheet mask stuck in their whiskers. Since the product\u2019s May launch, said Mr. Penfold, sales have doubled each month.\n\n\u201c One finance executive finds that a nightly masking pays off. \u201d\n\nStill, Annie Jackson, who co-founded the San Francisco-based cosmetics chain Credo, pointed out that male maskers tend to dwell in big cities, where unabashed preening and pore-cleaning carries less of a stigma. She finds that her male customers are looking for purifying or detoxifying masks, particularly gravitating to a charcoal mask from Georgia brand One Love Organics ($49 for a 2.1 oz jar), which Credo claims will \u201cclarify your complexion and extract dirt and debris.\u201d\n\nBut don\u2019t take such marketing at face value. \u201cWith big skin care companies you\u2019ve got to be skeptical,\u201d said Dr. Bradley Glodny, a New York-based dermatologist. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t trust the reviews and what the claims are. You\u2019ve got to try it for yourself and see if it helps you.\u201d To find a mask likely to address your needs (assuming you can articulate your skin\u2019s \u201cneeds\u201d), Dr. Glodny advises, learn what tasks individual ingredients perform. For example, calendula oil (from the marigold flower) and sulfur are anti-inflammatory and reduce redness, while charcoal and clay can \u201cdry up impurities\u201d and hyaluronic acid can help hydrate skin.\n\nGLOW BROS A slightly fratty moisturizing option. 100% Hydrogel Bro Mask, $28 for 4, jaxonlane.com\n\nEvan Wells, 37, who works at a financial software company in San Francisco, uses Drunk Elephant\u2019s T.L.C.

TM -0.03% may drop some underperforming models in the U.S., its head of North American operations said.\n\n\u201cWe are taking a hard look at all the segments we compete in, to make sure we are competing in profitable segments and that products that we sell have strategic value to the brand,\u201d Jim Lentz said Tuesday.\n\nModels under the microscope include fuel-sipping cars that have lost out to sport-utility vehicles, Mr. Lentz said\u2014such as the subcompact Yaris, whose U.S. sales have plummeted this year. Also, Toyota could sell fewer variants of the Prius hybrid in the U.S., he said, and scale back niche products like sports coupes and convertibles.\n\n\u201cMaybe you need one of those, but maybe you don\u2019t need two of them,\u201d Mr. Lentz said.\n\nThe shift in U.S. tastes isn\u2019t all that is driving Mr. Lentz: There\u2019s also Toyota\u2019s goal of an 8% operating margin in North America by the year ending in March 2021. A Toyota spokesman declined to specify the current figure, but indicated the target may be difficult to reach.\n\nChief Executive Akio Toyoda wants to boost the profitability of Toyota\u2019s traditional business to allow investment in new technologies. Leading the cost-cutting charge is Chief Financial Officer Koji Kobayashi, whom Mr. Toyoda brought from supplier Denso Corp.\n\nMr. Kobayashi has pushed white-collar workers to find ways to save money, including searching desk drawers for extra pens and pencils. That netted quite a haul, he said: \u201cWe might not have to buy new pencils for five years.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, Toyota said operating profit in the July-September quarter was up nearly 11% from a year earlier, to \u00a5579 billion ($5.1 billion). Unit sales in the U.S. fell, but more of the vehicles were higher-margin trucks and SUVs: In the first 10 months of the year they accounted for around 63% of U.S. unit sales, up from 58% last year.\n\nFiat Chrysler Automobiles NV killed several sedan models to make room for truck production, and has seen its profit margin in the U.S. surge as a result. Ford Motor Co. plans to abandon sedans almost entirely in the U.S.\n\nMr. Lentz said, \u201cI think it\u2019s a mistake to pull out of the passenger-car business,\u201d but he said some individual models were under review.\n\nU.S. sales of the $15,000 Yaris hatchback were down nearly 80% in the first 10 months of the year, and U.S. sales of the Prius C, a smaller version of the Prius hybrid vehicle, were down over 30%. Toyota has already stopped selling the larger Prius V in the U.S.\n\nMr. Lentz said he wants customers to think of hybrid technology\u2014which combines an electric motor with a gasoline engine\u2014as available in many models, not just those sold under the Prius name. Toyota hopes to increase hybrids\u2019 share of its U.S. sales to 15% by 2020, from around 9% today, by expanding sales of hybrid versions of popular models such as the RAV4 and Highlander SUVs.\n\nHybrids account for about 3.5% of overall U.S. sales.\n\nThe Prius has established the technology as synonymous with economy, Mr. Lentz said. Toyota wants to broaden that.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to rebrand hybrid,\u201d he said, \u201cto make sure people understand that it can be economical, but it can also be fun to drive.\u201d\n\nWrite to Sean McLain at sean.mclain@wsj.com", "Happy Election Day morning from the WSJ Washington bureau.

The commercial features Luis Bracamontes, a Mexican citizen who entered the U.S. illegally and was found guilty earlier this year of killing two sheriff\u2019s deputies in 2014.\n\nThe ad says Democrats \u201clet him into our country\u201d and \u201clet him stay\u201d; The Arizona Republic reported he entered the U.S. in 1996, when Democrat Bill Clinton was president, was deported in 1997 and resurfaced in the U.S. in 2001 when Republican George W. Bush was president.\n\nNBC and Fox News pulled the ad from broadcasts Monday, while CNN declined to air it. Facebook also said Monday it wouldn\u2019t allow the campaign to pay to distribute the ad on the platform, saying it violated the company\u2019s policy \u201cagainst sensational content.\u201d\n\nAsked about complaints that the ad was offensive, the president said Monday: \u201cA lot of things are offensive. Your questions are offensive a lot of the time.\u201d\n\nNavigating his first midterm election, Mr. Trump appeared to see himself as a central focus. \u201cIn a certain way, I am on the ballot,\u201d he told supporters Monday.\n\nMany of his supporters agreed.\n\n\u201cI do like Ted Cruz a lot...but I\u2019m a Trump man,\u201d said Rick LaBlanc, a retired oil industry executive who lives outside Houston. Mr. LaBlanc said he turned out for a Trump rally last month to show his support for the president, not for Sen. Cruz, who is up for re-election Tuesday.\n\nPresident Trump held rallies in key battleground states around the country Monday, urging supporters to vote and to campaign for Republican candidates ahead of Tuesday's midterm elections. Photo: AP\n\nMr. Trump has campaigned hard. Since the season ramped up after Labor Day, the president headlined 30 rallies\u201411 in competitive House districts and 19 in states with tight Senate and gubernatorial races, according to the White House.\n\nOn Monday morning he spoke to supporters in swing states on a conference call, warning that Democrats would thwart his agenda if they gained control of Congress.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all fragile,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cEverything I\u2019ve told you about, it can be undone and changed by the Democrats if they get in.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump also issued a warning on Twitter about illegal voting, vowing to press for harsh penalties. \u201cAnyone caught will be subject to the Maximum Criminal Penalties allowed by law. Thank you!\u201d the president tweeted.\n\nThe Justice Department said Monday it will send election observers to the polls in 19 states Tuesday as part of a longstanding program designed to ensure that federal election laws are upheld across the country.\n\nThe observers will be deployed in 35 counties or municipalities in Alaska, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Kansas, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Texas, Utah and Virginia.\n\n\u201cThis year we are using every lawful tool that we have, both civil and criminal, to protect the rights of millions of Americans to cast their vote unimpeded at one of more than 170,000 precincts across America,\u201d Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement.\n\n\u2014Janet Hook, Vivian Salama and Byron Tau\n\ncontributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Peter Nicholas at peter.nicholas@wsj.com and Rebecca Ballhaus at Rebecca.Ballhaus@wsj.com", "Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s decision to split its new headquarters exposes a secret known to many companies: It is tough to find top tech talent.\n\nAs The Wall Street Journal reported Monday, the e-commerce company has scuttled its original plan to pick a single location for a second headquarters, opting instead to build two hubs, according to a person familiar with the matter. The move stems, in part, from Amazon\u2019s need for talent\u2014and lots of it\u2014so increasing the number of locations will provide better access, the person said.\n\n...", "As voters head to the polls in the 2018 midterm elections Tuesday, a string of East Coast races could be early indicators on which party will win the battle for control of the U.S. House, while the fight for the U.S. Senate runs through a slate of tossup states that are in later time zones. Here\u2019s your guide to watching the results roll in on Election Day, based on East Coast times.\n\nThe first polls begin closing at 6 p.m. Eastern in Kentucky and Indiana.\n\nKentucky and Indiana: Indiana has some polls closing at 6 p.m. Eastern. But the key race to watch is in Kentucky: the state\u2019s sixth congressional district in Lexington. The seat is currently held by Republican Rep. Andy Barr, who represents an area where the GOP typically does well, but he is facing a well-financed opponent in retired Marine pilot Amy McGrath, a Democrat.\n\n7 p.m. Eastern\n\nPolls start to close in four key states: Virginia, Georgia, Florida and also Indiana, where a last batch of polls close in a state that is in two time zones. Polls also close in South Carolina.\n\nFlorida: Democrat Andrew Gillum, the mayor of Tallahassee, has attracted a grassroots following of young people and minorities. The party hopes Mr. Gillum\u2019s campaign for governor against the GOP\u2019s Ron DeSantis can bring more Democrats to the polls, all the while lifting the fortunes of incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson, who is being challenged for his Senate seat by outgoing Republican Gov. Rick Scott.\n\nOn the House side, the four most competitive races to watch are all prime pick opportunities for the Democrats: FL-26 and FL-27, two GOP-held districts that encompass part of the Miami-Dade region; FL-15 outside Tampa; and FL-16 in Sarasota County.\n\nIndiana: Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly, one of the party\u2019s most vulnerable incumbents, is being challenged by businessman Mike Braun. Republicans are looking to capture this seat to expand their 51-49 Senate majority or to create a buffer to offset loses elsewhere.\n\nGeorgia: The governor\u2019s race between progressive former state lawmaker Stacey Abrams and Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, a Republican, is one of the most watched in the country. She could make history by becoming the first black female governor in the U.S.\n\nThe WSJ's Gerald F. Seib talks about the numbers that are important to determine control of the House and Senate. Photo: Getty\n\nThere are also two key House races to watch: Georgia\u2019s sixth congressional district, home of a special election last year that launched this year\u2019s fierce fight for control of the chamber, where Rep. Karen Handel is facing Democrat Lucy McBath. The race illustrates how both parties this year have battled over suburban, educated women. The other is Georgia\u2019s seventh congressional district, where GOP Rep. Rob Woodall faces a tight race with Democratic challenger Carolyn Bourdeaux.\n\nVirginia: There are several opportunities for House Democrats to pick up seats. Rep. Barbara Comstock, an incumbent in the Washington, D.C., suburbs, is considered among the most vulnerable Republicans as she squares off against Democrat Jennifer Wexton.\n\nA more significant bellwether could be in Virginia\u2019s second congressional district, where GOP Rep. Scott Taylor faces a stiff challenge from Democratic businesswoman Elaine Luria. And Republican Rep. Dave Brat, who ousted Majority Leader Eric Cantor in a 2014 primary, is now in danger of losing his seat to Democrat Abigail Spanberger.\n\n7:30 p.m. Eastern\n\nPolls start to close in three states: North Carolina, Ohio and West Virginia.\n\nOhio: The governor\u2019s race in Ohio is nationally watched because 2016 GOP presidential candidate John Kasich is leaving the governor\u2019s mansion due to term limits. Republican Mike DeWine faces Democrat Richard Cordray in the race to follow Mr. Kasich.\n\nA rematch in Ohio\u2019s 12th congressional district in suburban Columbus could also be telling. Rep. Troy Balderson won a special election there this year\u2014but just barely beating Democrat Danny O\u2019Connor\u2014signaling the GOP\u2019s weakening grip in suburbia.\n\nWest Virginia: Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin\u2019s state voted for President Trump in 2016 by 42 percentage points. Yet, Mr. Manchin is leading attorney general Patrick Morrisey in public polling, and a victory would demonstrate that a candidate\u2019s personal brand can outweigh party affiliation.\n\nWhat to Watch: 8 p.m. to 9 p.m.\n\nAt 8 p.m. Eastern, the largest set of states will close, including eight states with competitive Senate races. Statewide competitive races 8 p.m.: Senate S TN MI PA MO MS TX ND IL CT NJ G Governor KS OK MD RI SD Other states closing: DE AL MA ME AR Competitive House races closing Democrat-held Republican-held Tossup Likely Democrat Lean Republican Likely Republican Lean Democrat\n\n8 p.m. Eastern\n\nPolls start to close in Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee and Texas.\n\nKansas: The governor\u2019s race is a tossup between Republican Kris Kobach and Democrat Laura Kelly, and there are two potential House upsets. GOP Rep. Kevin Yoder\u2019s seat in the third House district is at risk of falling into the Democratic column, as the race now leans in favor of challenger Sharice Davids. There is also a tossup race for an open seat in the state\u2019s second congressional district, where Rep. Lynn Jenkins, a Republican, is retiring.\n\nMichigan: GOP Rep. Mike Bishop, whose eighth district includes a swath of the Detroit suburbs, faces a tough challenger in Elissa Slotkin, a former CIA case officer, creating a key pick-up opportunity for Democrats.\n\nMississippi: There are two Senate races in the state, but one of them is unlikely to be decided Tuesday night. That\u2019s because GOP Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith isn\u2019t the only Republican vying for the seat: Republican Chris McDaniel is running against her, as is Democrat Mike Espy, creating a three-way race. The top two vote-getters advance to a Nov. 27 runoff if none of them can claim an outright majority of the vote on Election Day, under Mississippi election rules.\n\nMissouri: Sen. Claire McCaskill is another endangered Democrat in the Senate. She faces state Attorney General Josh Hawley. President Trump made two trips to the state in the final days to try to knock off Ms. McCaskill.\n\nNew Jersey: Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez, plagued by questions over his ethics despite escaping conviction in a corruption trial last year, is unpopular in a state that leans Democratic. He faces GOP businessman Bob Hugin. If Republicans can defeat Mr. Menendez, it would bode well for their ability to maintain control of the Senate.\n\nVoters across the country will head to the polls Tuesday to cast their votes in the general election. The WSJ's Gerald F. Seib explains five areas that are worth watching as results come in. Photo: Getty\n\nPennsylvania: There are four competitive U.S. House races in Pennsylvania, all of them pick-up opportunities for the Democrats, and they are looking here to make a strong down payment on their path toward a majority. Republicans have called this \u201cground zero\u201d in the battle for House control. Several districts moved further out of reach for Republicans due to court-issued redistricting in the state.\n\nTennessee: The open Senate seat in Tennessee\u2014Republican Sen. Bob Corker is retiring\u2014is critical to Democrats if they have any hope of gaining ground in the chamber. Former Gov. Phil Bredesen, who was endorsed by singer Taylor Swift, is challenging Rep. Marsha Blackburn, who benefited from a Trump endorsement.\n\nTexas: Can Democratic Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke topple GOP Sen. Ted Cruz in a deep-red state? It would be one of the biggest political upsets in the history of the Senate, and a signal that the Lone Star state could be in play during the 2020 presidential race.\n\nAlso in Texas, Democrats are targeting Republican Reps. Pete Sessions in a district outside Dallas and John Culberson of Houston, both in tossup races. A defeat of Rep. Will Hurd, who is facing Democrat Gina Ortiz-Jones, would signal a difficult night for Republicans.\n\nWhat to Watch: 9 p.m. to 10 p.m.\n\nAt 9 p.m., polls start closing in Minnesota, which includes the only toss up and lean Republican seats held by Democrats. Statewide competitive races 9 p.m.: Senate S AZ MN CO WI G Governor Other states closing: NY NM NE WY LA Competitive House races closing Republican-held Democrat-held Lean Democrat Likely Republican Lean Republican Likely Democrat Tossup\n\n9 p.m. Eastern\n\nOfficials start counting ballots in Arizona, Colorado, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Mexico, New York and Wisconsin.\n\nArizona: An open Senate seat creates a rare opening for Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema to gain a seat for her party, but her fight against Rep. Martha McSally has been extremely tight. The seat is open because Sen. Jeff Flake, a Republican, is retiring.\n\nMinnesota: Four races in Minnesota are a bellwether for control of the House. Both parties agree that if Democrats win in three of these four districts, it would be a bad sign for the GOP elsewhere in the country. The four races are:\n\nMN-01: Democrats currently hold this seat in rural Minnesota. If they can hang on, it may mean they are faring better in rural areas than they often get credit for. Democrat Dan Feehan faces Republican Jim Hagedorn in that open-seat race.\n\nMN-02: GOP Rep. Jason Lewis faces a stiff challenge from Democrat Angie Craig in outskirts of the Twin Cities.\n\nMN-03: Republican Rep. Erik Paulsen faces Democrat Dean Phillips, presenting another test for the GOP in the suburbs.\n\nMN-08: This is a seat the GOP is supposed to flip and create a small buffer against any other losses. Republican Pete Stauber is matched up with Democrat Joe Radinovich.\n\nWhat to Watch: 10 p.m. and Later\n\nThe last 10 states start closing polls at 10 p.m. Eastern. Alaska runs the latest, keeping polls open until at least midnight on the East Coast. Statewide competitive races 10 p.m.: Senate S NV IA MT 11 p.m.: OR G Governor Midnight: AK Other states closing: HI CA UT WA ID Competitive House races closing Democrat-held Republican-held Lean Democrat Tossup Lean Republican Likely Republican Likely Democrat\n\n10 p.m. Eastern\n\nPolls start to close in Iowa, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, North Dakota and Utah.\n\nNevada, Montana, North Dakota: These three states will likely determine control of the Senate. Democratic Sens. Jon Tester of Montana and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota are hoping to win in states President Trump took in 2016. Mr. Tester\u2019s race is a tossup against Republican Matt Rosendale; Ms. Heitkamp\u2019s race is leaning in favor of her Republican opponent, Rep. Kevin Cramer.\n\nIn Nevada, Republican Sen. Dean Heller, the chamber\u2019s most vulnerable GOP incumbent, battles Democratic Rep. Jacky Rosen.\n\n11 p.m. Eastern\n\nPolls start to close in California, Oregon and Washington state. Oregon and Washington have all-mail voting, but ballots can be turned in as late as 8 p.m. local time; that\u2019s 11 p.m. on the East Coast. The races to watch:\n\nCalifornia: If the battle for the U.S. House isn\u2019t determined by 11 p.m. when polls close in California, there are seven competitive seats here that could settle the outcome:\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nCA-10 (tossup): GOP Rep. Jeff Denham faces Democrat Josh Harder.\n\nCA-25 (tossup): GOP Rep. Steve Knight faces Democrat Katie Hill.\n\nCA-39 (tossup): In a race for an open GOP seat, Republican Young Kim is being challenged by Democrat Gil Cisneros.\n\nCA-45 (tossup): GOP Rep. Mimi Walters is up against Democrat Katie Porter.\n\nCA-48 (tossup): GOP Rep. Dana Rohrabacher faces Democratic businessman Harley Rouda.\n\nCA-49 (leaning Democratic): Democratic lawyer Mike Levin is leading Republican Diane Harkey in polls.\n\nCA-50 (leaning Republican): GOP Rep. Duncan Hunter faces Democrat Ammar Campa-Najjar.\n\nOregon: Oregon may elect a GOP governor for the first time in 36 years. Republican Knute Buehler is campaigning for voters unhappy with Democratic Gov. Kate Brown\u2014and President Trump. Mr. Buehler said he wrote in Ohio\u2019s moderate Republican Gov. Kasich in the 2016 presidential election rather than back Mr. Trump.\n\nWashington: The state\u2019s southwestern corner has seen an influx of nearly $2 million in new spending from both parties, indicating that the seat held for four terms by GOP Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler is in jeopardy. Her opponent is Democrat Carolyn Long.\n\n12 a.m. Eastern\n\nPolls close in Alaska.\n\nAlaska Gov. Bill Walker, an independent, suspended his re-election bid less than three weeks before the election. The move came three days after the sudden resignation of Lt. Gov. Byron Mallott over what Mr. Walker described as an inappropriate overture toward a woman. The three-way governor\u2019s race is leaning in favor of Republican candidate Mike Dunleavy over Democrat Mark Begich but after such a recent scandal, the outcome is hard to call.\n\nAmplification:\n\nIndiana has some polls closing at 6 p.m. Eastern. But a last batch of polls close at 7 p.m. Eastern in Indiana because the state is in two time zones.\n\nWrite to Joshua Jamerson at joshua.jamerson@wsj.com and Danny Dougherty at danny.dougherty@wsj.com", "BELGRADE, Serbia\u2014Europe is distracted by internal discord over immigration and its tense relationship with Russia and the U.S. Seeking to fill the void, China is taking advantage of a historic opportunity to wedge itself into the heart of the West.\n\nDeal by deal, applying experience honed in Asia and Africa, China is constructing parallel financial and commercial networks in Central and Eastern Europe to challenge the global order.

Actually, three: He closed his own eponymous menswear label, moved from New York to Los Angeles, and started a job as Vice President of men\u2019s design at Vince, known for plush sweaters and a low-key-yet-sophisticated vibe. \u201cEverybody always says you move to California later in life,\u201d Ervell says simply. \u201cThat\u2019s the natural progression.\u201d WSJ. caught up with the new(ish) Angeleno, whose first collection with the label is available in stores and online, to discuss \u201chis\u201d Vince, why California style is so influential right now, and, naturally, what kind of car he drives now that he lives in L.A.\n\nMax Berlinger: When you took the job at Vince you closed your own namesake label and moved from New York to California. That\u2019s a lot of big life changes!\n\nPatrik Ervell Photo: Justin Chung\n\nPatrik Ervell: You spend your twenties and early thirties in New York and then you move to L.A. You put in your time in New York and want to try something else. Of course I love New York\u2014I could imagine going back one day, for sure. I just think something about L.A. felt right, and California felt right. I keep saying: California has never felt more like the future than it does today. I think it feels like an exciting time to be here.\n\nMB: You\u2019re from Northern California, so does this feel like a return home for you?\n\nPE: Sort of. People in San Francisco would say it\u2019s not at all the same thing\u2014and it\u2019s not. It\u2019s a foreign country. I\u2019m from Northern California, which, in a way, feels more Vince to me anyway. This is a company that digs into an understated luxury, and that\u2019s much more of a Northern California ethos than an L.A. ethos.\n\nMB: When you started a year ago, what did you want to bring to Vince?\n\nPE: For me, the idea of luxury from California hadn\u2019t really ever been explored. There\u2019s a way of dressing here that\u2019s very specific\u2014specific codes and manners here that have trickled out to the rest of the world. There are types of garments that have come from here, which in my mind have always been iconic and have been part of my design language since day one. I\u2019m thinking of things like a Patagonia fleece and a North Face jacket. Those, to me, are as iconic as a trench coat. To start from that history is, to me, very rich and exciting.\n\nMB: Did you want to plant a stake in the ground and say \u2018Here I am, this is what I want Vince to be\u2019? Or did you want to build more slowly?\n\nPhoto: Bruno Staub\n\nPE: This is a much bigger company than my own was. This is not a ship that takes sharp turns. It\u2019s a gradual process of pointing it in a new direction and that takes a minute. It\u2019s also not a company \u2014and never will be, which is on purpose\u2014that will take drastic seasonal changes. We\u2019re not interested in being tied to that six-month fashion cycle. For that reason it\u2019s a gradual turn, which is necessary.\n\nMB: So how does a collection go from idea to actual garments?\n\nPE: It\u2019s like a mood and zeitgeist that gets set. You see that with the fall collection. We\u2019re leaning into this elevated California aesthetic, but with a little nostalgia mixed in. We\u2019ve defined a place, but now we\u2019re defining a time, a time of year and a mood. And honing in on that involves photographic research, fabric research. It involves color, and that alchemy of those things coming together\u2014that gives birth to the collection.\n\nMB: Now that you\u2019ve been at the brand for a year, do you have an idea of where you\u2019d like to take Vince?\n\nPE: Of course. There\u2019s many parts of that, too, from the product, in its most pure and simple form, to our Vince menswear Instagram account, which we launched two weeks ago. It\u2019s still a baby.\n\nMB: Vince and your own brand are known for being understated. Do you find it hard to communicate that in a time where social media encourages people to be flashy?\n\nPE: We are in a loud moment, especially in menswear. Fashion is always about reaction, and Vince finds itself in this opposite space that opens up on the other side. The cycle is exhausting and has maybe already exhausted itself, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a game we need to play.\n\nPhoto: Bruno Staub\n\nMB: Have you seen people on the street wearing your collection?\n\nPE: I\u2019ve seen many people actually. It\u2019s exciting. I have to stop myself from staring and smiling. It\u2019s a brand that has a much more mass reach. I think as of this week it\u2019s shifted entirely to my product, so that\u2019s a long time, a full year to it being all my designs.\n\nMB: You\u2019re a year into living in L.A.\u2014 is there anything in particular you\u2019ve come to love about the city?\n\nPE: I\u2019ve discovered the pleasures of driving. At first I was kind of like: Ugh. But it\u2019s actually kind of amazing. You\u2019ll be in the car and a song comes on the radio, or there\u2019s a certain light, and there\u2019s something really special about it.

The 61-year-old author from St. Petersburg, Fla., got the idea for her novel during a game when a young player puffed up her chest and made a big bet against her. Ms. Massey won the hand, but her opponent stuck in her imagination and inspired her book\u2019s heroine.\n\nWriting a book itself is a gamble.

Photo: Ryan Collerd for The Wall Street Journal\n\nTwo years ago, Christa Bottomley\u2019s healthy 5-year-old son caught a viral cold like the rest of the family. Everyone else recovered, but in his case the virus triggered a neurological condition.\n\nThe condition is called acute flaccid myelitis, or AFM. Though rare, it has jumped onto the national radar. As doctors struggle to explain its third nationwide peak since 2014, families like the Bottomleys are trying to provide hope to others hit with the sudden, polio-like disease and to push for more awareness in the medical community.\n\nAFM causes inflammation of the nervous system, particularly the gray matter of the spinal cord, which results in weakening muscles in usually one or more arms and legs. It can also affect the face and lead to difficulty swallowing or even breathing. Almost all AFM patients are hospitalized for several days or even months.\n\nIt affects mainly children, who sometimes recover over time, often with therapy. Others remain paralyzed, needing long-term care and rehabilitation.\n\nSebastian was in a hospital in Hershey, Pa., for three weeks and lost movement in both arms and legs. He couldn\u2019t sit up or turn his head in one direction. He spent another 60 days at Kennedy Krieger pediatric hospital in Baltimore, but still couldn\u2019t move his right arm or either leg.\n\nHe has since had some mobility restored through surgeries and rehabilitation. He can walk with a walker and leg braces, though he still predominantly uses a wheelchair outside of the house. He must travel from his home in York, Pa., to Kennedy Krieger for weekly therapy.\n\n\u201cI wish people had listened in 2016 when we said this is coming,\u201d Ms. Bottomley says. \u201cNobody wanted to listen. I think it will be the same thing in 2020, and hopefully we will have their attention then.\u201d\n\nEvery two years since 2014 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has documented a spike in AFM, almost always in children. The CDC is investigating 219 reports of patients with AFM so far this year, with 80 cases in 25 states confirmed, up from 33 the year before. In 2016 the CDC confirmed 149 cases of AFM and in 2014 there were 120 cases.\n\nDoctors and the CDC differ on the possible cause of the condition and how to treat it. Many doctors speculate AFM is largely fueled by a common virus called the enterovirus, which for most people causes nothing more than a routine upper-respiratory infection. But the CDC believes there could be other culprits.\n\nSome experts believe the condition likely existed before 2014 and think there could be more cases, since there is no national requirement to report as there is for many other conditions, including influenza and measles.\n\n\u201cIf there was mandatory reporting, it would help with surveillance,\u201d says Keith Van Haren, an assistant professor of neurology at the Stanford University School of Medicine. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t appear to be going away. We need to be preparing and anticipating the possibility of a more severe outbreak.\u201d\n\nMore than 50 researchers formed a working group in October to identify the mechanism of the disease and come up with better diagnosis and treatment standards for medical professionals.\n\nIn 2014, experts first noticed a link between myelitis\u2014inflammation of the spinal cord\u2014and the enterovirus D68 strain. This year, doctors discovered another possible link, to enterovirus strain A71.\n\nSebastian Bottomley walks outside his York, Pa., home every day to help regain the strength he lost after contracting AFM two years ago. He uses a wheelchair when traveling outside of his home. Photo: Ryan Collerd for The Wall Street Journal\n\nSo far this year, Children\u2019s Hospital Colorado has treated about a dozen children with AMF. The majority of them have tested positive for enterovirus A71, with only one testing positive for the D68 strain. The good news, says Samuel Dominguez, a pediatric infectious disease doctor at the hospital, is that most of the children with enterovirus A71 have already recovered. The one with enterovirus D68 hasn\u2019t.\n\nThe CDC isn\u2019t focusing just on enterovirus as the main trigger. When samples are taken from the respiratory tract, a sizable portion of patients have tested positive for enterovirus\u2014but not the majority, Kathleen Dooling, medical officer at the CDC and incident manager for their AFM response, says.\n\nPriya Duggal, director of the genetic epidemiology program at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, is conducting a study to see if the AFM victims share any relevant genes.\n\nHer research group has collected saliva samples from 60 AFM patients and their family members and extracted their DNA so they could sequence their genome.\n\nSuzanne Rybczynski, medical director of the pediatric rehabilitation inpatient hospital at Kennedy Krieger, says they have had six AFM inpatients this year from all over the U.S., with more seeking to be admitted. Some children will go on to receive nerve-transfer surgery, in which nerves that are still working are diverted to help power another muscle group.\n\nThe patients come to Kennedy Krieger when they are medically stable\u2014though some are still on ventilators\u2014and ready to start rehabilitation. That includes using robotics and electrical stimulation to help the body\u2019s muscles remember how to move, as well as aquatic and animal-assisted therapy, Dr. Rybczynski says.\n\nChrista Bottomley helps her son, Sebastian, put on leg braces. Ms. Bottomley says thousands of hours of rehabilitation and nerve-transfer surgeries have enabled her son to be able to walk with a walker and braces. Photo: Ryan Collerd for The Wall Street Journal\n\nOn visits there in recent months, Ms. Bottomley has met other families with young children going through the same experience.\n\n\u201cI tell them the recovery will be long and slow, but if they do a little bit of physical therapy every day, that helps the most,\u201d she says.\n\nAmong those Ms. Bottomley has met is Chris Carr, from Roanoke, Va., whose 4-year-old son, Camdyn, has been on a ventilator for more than a month.\n\nCamdyn is improving and recently started talking again, but 85% of his body remains paralyzed, including the left side of his face. \u201cHe can move his right leg, can wiggle his left toes and can squeeze with the left hand,\u201d says Mr. Carr, who had to quit his job as a welder to stay with his son. \u201cHe can\u2019t sit up on his own, he can\u2019t use the bathroom, he can\u2019t do anything.\u201d\n\nMr. Carr says doctors told him the AFM was caused by the enterovirus, but he isn\u2019t sure which strain. He is already thinking about surgery, but will have to wait at least six months for that. Meanwhile, they will do physical therapy and hope for more improvements.\n\n\u201cIt is life-changing,\u201d Mr. Carr says. \u201cMy child could need assistance to live for the rest of his life, well past when I\u2019m dead and gone.\u201d\n\nSome Hope for Recovery Nerve-transfer surgeries are giving some AFM patients movement that their families thought they would never have again. At age 6, Ariel Serrano was among the first cluster of AFM patients in the fall of 2014. She regained mobility naturally, except in her right arm, and was accepted for surgery, in which doctors take nerves that are still working and divert or relocate them to help power a different muscle group. Only a few doctors in the country perform such surgeries for AFM patients. Among them is Mitchel Seruya, director of the Brachial Plexus and Peripheral Nerve Center at Children\u2019s Hospital Los Angeles, who removed a muscle from Ariel\u2019s inner thigh and transferred it to her right arm. He then connected rib nerves to the new muscle in her arm. Now, Ariel can bend her elbow to pick things up and feed herself, though she is still working on her strength, says her mother, Ingrid Herrera. She is back to swimming and took first place in a recent judo competition. When the whole arm is paralyzed, nerves must be diverted from the ribs and children must learn how to activate their arm by coughing or whistling. But eventually the brain learns to do it automatically. Some doctors say because nerve transfers in AFM patients haven\u2019t been systematically studied, they shouldn\u2019t be considered a cure. \u201cIt may help gain function in one muscle group, but typically there\u2019s not a dramatic benefit,\u201d says Keith Van Haren, an assistant professor of neurology at the Stanford University School of Medicine. How successful the surgeries are can depend on which part of the body is targeted. Dan Zlotolow, a pediatric upper-extremity surgeon at Shriners Hospital for Children in Philadelphia who has performed 17 surgeries on AFM patients, says he has had a lot of success on elbow surgeries, but less with the shoulder. The only surgeon who has attempted to do nerve-transfer surgeries in the legs of AFM patients is Amy Moore, an associate professor in plastic surgery at Washington University in St. Louis. She usually transfers nerves that move the toes to nerves that stabilize the hip or move the knee. Because nerves grow an inch a month, it can take up to a year to see effects. \u201cIt\u2019s not making them normal, but it is providing them with the hope and the potential that one day they may be able to stand or even walk,\u201d she says.\n\nWrite to Sumathi Reddy at sumathi.reddy@wsj.com", "From Exxon Mobil Corp. to Phillips 66, energy companies are reaping banner profits by taking cheap oil landlocked in North America and turning it into fuel.\n\nTremendous growth in oil output has overwhelmed pipelines and depressed crude prices in some regions of Texas and Canada.

They include marquee names such as Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Corp. and smaller firms such as tire-maker Amerityre Corp.\n\nThe SEC questioned nearly one-third of early adopters over their compliance with the revenue recognition standard. Seventy percent of the letters included questions about how companies arrived at their decisions for performance obligations measurements.\n\n\u201cThe biggest lesson is that as long as you can justify your reasoning for whatever performance obligation measurement you came up with, I think the SEC will initially allow them some leeway or provide guidance,\u201d said Rob Peters, senior director of customer experience and knowledge at Intelligize.\n\nThe regulator engaged in protracted conversations with three companies\u2014Alphabet, General Dynamics Corp. and Commvault Systems Inc.\u2014as the agency sought to clarify the judgements and analysis the companies used to reach their decisions.\n\n\u201cThe questions they asked were focused on many of the areas we spent the most time assessing as part of our adoption,\u201d Jay Whalen, corporate controller at Commvault, said in an email. \u201cIn the end, we made some minor modifications to disclosures that were beneficial for the users of our financial statements.\u201d\n\nAn Alphabet spokeswoman declined to comment.

It was time to pay for one of the world\u2019s longest-serving leaders.\n\nFor weeks, several former hotel employees recalled, the five-star hotel had been locked in a secret routine serving its best two customers, the first couple of an impoverished oil-exporting Central African country. Paul Biya, president of Cameroon since 1982, and his wife, Chantal, clock so much time on private visits to Switzerland that staff in the Intercontinental\u2019s gilded corridors refer to them by simple code names: Him and Her.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like they are at home. They live there,\u201d said one of three former senior employees who regularly witnessed the bill-payment ritual.\n\nAs with other employees, this person recalled signing a nondisclosure agreement concerning the details of Mr. Biya\u2019s monthlong stays: \u201cIf the Cameroonians are not coming, the hotel will close.\u201d\n\nThe Intercontinental Hotel said it wouldn\u2019t comment on guests for confidentiality reasons. \u201cOur employees are fully trained not to disclose any information,\u201d a representative said.\n\nThe Intercontinental Hotel, Geneva. Photo: fabrice coffrini/Agence France-Presse/Getty Images\n\nWorld leaders dropping top dollar at luxury hotels isn\u2019t by itself unusual. What distinguishes Mr. Biya\u2019s Geneva getaways is the abundant time and hard cash the 85-year-old and his dozens-strong entourage spend here. The president has passed a cumulative four years on personal travels since 1982, the vast majority in Switzerland, according to flight data collected by the website Geneva Dictator Alert, and Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, an investigative group specializing in anticorruption and organized crime that has tracked his travels. In some years he spent a third of the year out of his home country.\n\n\u201cHe always pays in cash,\u201d said Herbert Schott, a retired Intercontinental manager who first hosted Mr. Biya in 1969. \u201cNext year he will mark 50 consecutive years of patronage. It\u2019s a record.\u201d\n\nMr. Schott welcomed a quarter-century\u2019s worth of American presidents and once gave Ronald Reagan a mattress to replace the White House bedroom\u2019s harsher one. But he said Mr. Biya was his best client. \u201cHe prefers to come to Geneva and sit down and nobody would bother him.\u201d\n\n\u201cLion Man,\u201d as Mr. Biya\u2019s supporters call him, is currently the world\u2019s longest serving elected leader, if counting from his June 1975 arrival as prime minister, the same week McDonald\u2019s Corp. introduced its drive-through. Since 1982, he has served as president. He is Africa\u2019s highest-paid leader, with a $610,000 official salary annually, according to Africa Review, a periodical.\n\nIn Mr. Biya\u2019s fourth decade in power, armed separatists are battling soldiers in Cameroon\u2019s southwest, while Islamist terror group Boko Haram seizes villages and kidnaps children en masse in the northeast. Hundreds of thousands have fled their homes in the past two years. Cameroonian migrants now represent the fourth largest nationality sailing into Greece.\n\nLast month, Mr. Biya won another seven years in office, taking 71% of the vote in an election in which riot police dispersed protesters. In some areas, less than 5% of the population voted. No Western government sent observers.\n\n\u201cWe love him, we voted for him and there is nothing new in his habits,\u201d said Cameroon\u2019s Communications Minister Issa Bakary Tchiroma in response to questions about Mr. Biya\u2019s Geneva hotel stays. \u201cWe ask everyone, all foreigners, to respect the will of our sovereign people.\u201d\n\nMr. Biya has rarely given interviews to foreign media in recent years.\n\nIn Geneva, the president reserves the entire Intercontinental\u2019s 16th floor, with some 20 rooms and two corner suites overlooking the United Nations\u2019 Europe headquarters and Mont Blanc, said ex-employees, former Cameroon officials, and hotel reservation records reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. The staff haul armfuls of white flowers for his wife and fresh fruit platters\u2014never cut, per presidential orders\u2014for Mr. Biya, according to former hotel staff.\n\nMr. Biya\u2019s trips cost millions of dollars apiece, said Christian Penda Ekoka, a longtime chief adviser to the president, turned opposition activist.\n\nMr. Biya and his wife arrive at Andrews Air Force Base, Md., in 2014 for the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit. Photo: Cliff Owen/Associated Press\n\n\u201cHe gets the money from Cameroon\u2019s treasury\u201d and pays in cash to keep the trips off books, said Mr. Ekoka, who used to be chief adviser to Mr. Biya and had access to trip details. \u201cThey want to avoid any trace.\u201d\n\nThe Biyas in Switzerland in 2010. Photo: SEBASTIEN BOZON/Agence France-Presse/Getty Images\n\nA hotel reservation receipt seen by the Journal shows the size of the president\u2019s entourage. In one September 2017 stay, he booked at least 48 rooms. Other Cameroonians stayed in less expensive hotels, former employees said, depending on their standing with the president.\n\nTo the U.S. and Europe, Mr. Biya is a valuable if awkward ally against terrorism and migration. The U.S. keeps 200 troops and several predator drones at a base in north Cameroon. American and Israeli special forces train Mr. Biya\u2019s troops.\n\nThe European Union has pledged 282 million euros in aid for Cameroon. The hope is the country will grow wealthier, creating jobs to lure Cameroonians back to Cameroon.\n\nThe first protests, violently repressed by the Cameroonian armed forces, broke out two years ago. Mr. Biya was at the Intercontinental. He stayed another three weeks after, according to publicly available flight data and Cameroonian state press.\n\nIn Geneva, Mr. Biya seldom leaves his corner suite, former hotel staff said. For privacy, the Cameroonian delegation installs its own internet connection and phone switchboard. He enters and exits through the service exit for daily jogs, according to former hotel employees.\n\nMr. Biya\u2019s suite overlooks tranquil Lake Geneva and a boulevard with placards extolling the virtues of human rights, democracy, rule of law: Geneva is a global capital for humanitarian and pro-democracy institutions.\n\nThen U.N.

Mr. Trump is featuring his campaign\u2019s new ad in a note pinned to the top of his Twitter profile, and by Thursday morning it had been viewed more than 2.5 million times.\n\nA Trump campaign spokeswoman didn\u2019t immediately respond to a question about whether the campaign is going to pay for the ad to air on TV. Parts of it have been airing on TV news programs since it was posted online Wednesday afternoon.\n\nTHE MAN WHO SPEAKS FIRST in the ad, Luis Bracamontes, received the death penalty in April for killing two California sheriff\u2019s deputies in 2014. He had crossed the Mexican border illegally numerous times and been deported twice, according to the Los Angeles Times. His illegal entries spanned at least three presidencies, Democratic and Republican, and his deportations occurred under presidents of both parties.\n\nThe ad then cuts to images of the immigrant caravan crossing the border from Guatemala into Mexico, and then to another immigrant saying through a translator that he plans to request a pardon for a crime, which he then says is attempted murder.\n\nMr. Trump has been working to gin up excitement among his base of voters ahead of the Nov. 6 election. He has repeatedly said the immigrant caravan would bring criminals to the U.S. and tied the caravan to Democrats, but he has offered no evidence to support either accusation.\n\nAl Cardenas, a Republican strategist who doesn\u2019t support Mr. Trump, said of him on Twitter, regarding the ad, \u201cYou are a despicable divider; the worse social poison to afflict our country in decades.
