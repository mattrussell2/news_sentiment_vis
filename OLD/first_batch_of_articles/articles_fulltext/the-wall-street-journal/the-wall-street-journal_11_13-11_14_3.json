Register here.\n\nReader comments and evaluations were scored in a customer-satisfaction grade for each of the 20 busiest U.S. airports, making the 15th category. With both user experiences and data on convenience, cost and reliability, the rankings offer perhaps the most comprehensive evaluation of U.S. airports.\n\nThe rankings were limited to the 20 largest airports to provide fair comparisons at airports dealing with the complexity of tens of millions of passengers. Many readers have favorites among smaller airports, but they don\u2019t always deal with the same challenges of congestion, delays and crowds.\n\nThe measures used were selected by Middle Seat columnist Scott McCartney and several editors. They fell into three main categories:\n\nConvenience\n\n1. WSJ reader survey. More than 4,800 subscribers participated in an online survey of airport preferences and experiences. Comments and evaluations were scored into an overall customer-satisfaction grade for each of the 20 airports.\n\n2. Non-stop cities served. Non-stop flights offer convenience for travelers. Airports offer incentives to airlines for new service, and most have active recruitment programs to expand service. Having more destinations scored higher. The number of destinations was reported by each airport.\n\n3. Wi-Fi speed. Average download speed from Ookla Speedtest conducted at airports January-April 2018 on available free Wi-Fi.\n\n4. Longest walk. Provided by each airport. Airports were asked for the longest possible walk from the curb of the terminal to the farthest gate, including use of escalators, moving walkways and trains or trams.\n\n5. Yelp restaurant rating. Yelp provided averages of its ratings for all restaurants at each airport, as of October 2017.\n\nReliability\n\n6. On-time arrivals. Bureau of Transportation Statistics data for the 12 months ending July 2018 showing the percentage of flights at each airport arriving at gates within 14 minutes of scheduled time, the Transportation Department\u2019s definition of on-time.\n\n7. Percentage of flights canceled. BTS data for 12 months ending July 2018. Reliability matters and this category, like others, showed wide operational differences. At LaGuardia, more than 4% of flights were canceled. At Seattle, less than half of one percent.\n\n8. Average arrival delay. This is the measure of when flights are delayed, how badly do things go. BTS data for 12 months ending July 2018.\n\n9. Aircraft taxi-out times. This measure reflects both congestion and traffic delays at airports as well as the layout of the airfield. Taxiing is a significant part of a flight. Las Vegas had the lowest average taxi-out time, but it was still close to 15 minutes. Data from BTS for January through July 2018.\n\n10. TSA wait times. Waits in standard lanes (not PreCheck), January-July 2018, provided by TSA. Note that TSA collection of wait-time data has been questioned for reliability since managers could take discretion on when data is collected. Several airports are moving to automatic systems that can post current wait times.\n\nValue\n\n11. Average domestic fare. The cost to fly into and out of each airport, based on a sampling of tickets collected by BTS for the first quarter of 2018.\n\n12. Largest airline\u2019s market share. This measures the dominance of the largest carrier at an airport and reflects how much competition there is. A lower passenger share\u2014more competition\u2014was scored higher than having one airline with a fortress hub. The data are from BTS for a 12-month period ending June 2018.\n\n13. Cheapest on-site parking. The cheapest parking rate (provided by each airport) represents a direct measure of value at an airport\u2014how concerned it is with accommodating its most budget-minded travelers.\n\n14. Rental-car taxes and fees. Based on total taxes and fees on a $100, two-day rental at Hertz. Not all taxes and fees are airport-related; some include fees for sports stadiums, state-imposed and city-imposed taxes. Many airports do collect added fees to pay for constructing consolidated rental-car facilities and other costs, and many communities have taken to heavily taxing visitors.\n\n15. Average UberX fare to convention center. Uber provided its average UberX fare from each airport to the city\u2019s primary convention center for October.\n\nData research by Mark Secada, Phillipa Ramirez and Allison Foley of the WSJ R&D team.", "2:29\n\nThis startup wants to be your new tailor\n\nThis startup is trying to shake up the tailoring industry: ALTRD, based in New York City, connects people who need alterations with immigrant women who are experts at sewing and can do the job from home.", "Uber Technologies Inc. is seeing slower sales growth ahead of its planned initial public offering next year.\n\nThe ride-hailing company on Wednesday announced third-quarter revenue rose 38% from a year earlier to $2.95 billion, but that was less than the second-quarter year-over-year jump of 63%.

JFK was next-to-last; LaGuardia scoring only slightly better.\n\n[Explore the Journal\u2019s 2018 ranking of the biggest U.S. airports.]\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard not to ask the question, in what universe is that OK?\u201d says Mr. Cotton, appointed by New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo in August 2017.\n\nMr. Cotton is trying to improve conditions even as construction creates more hassles for travelers. Last month, the Port Authority announced it had installed faster Wi-Fi with a minimum speed of 20 MB per second at all three airports and was giving travelers four hours of free Wi-Fi service instead of the previous 30-minute free limit.\n\nSome changes seem decades overdue. Airport operations have started to track which elevators and escalators are out of service, for example. Bathrooms are finally getting more-regular cleaning and even full-time attendants. Taxi lines have changed to load several cabs at once, roller-coaster style, and lines at JFK have been moved indoors.\n\nInside the Airport Rankings The Journal has ranked the 20 largest U.S. airports after weighing 14 key factors plus a survey of over 4,800 readers.

The first new gates may open by the end of this year. Nearly $3 billion is planned to rebuild Terminal A at Newark. And replacing two terminals at JFK plus other changes will cost about $13 billion.\n\nAirport critics say the $24 billion program has a serious failing\u2014no new runways to ease the severe but routine delays, and not much capacity to grow. Joseph Sitt, a real-estate developer who founded and chairs the Global Gateway Alliance, a business group pushing for airport overhauls, says the plans cover about 90% of what GGA wanted, but still are incomplete.\n\n\u201cThis is not just a game of cosmetics,\u201d he says.\n\nLong taxi lines at LaGuardia, above, are among areas for improvement at airports around New York City. Photo: Adrienne Grunwald for The Wall Street Journal\n\nNew York needs to be an important aviation hub, Mr. Sitt argues, but the city will be constrained without additional runways at both Kennedy and LaGuardia. Acquiring land or filling in watershed for a new runway at either airport would be expensive and politically difficult, he acknowledges, but necessary. One proposal for LaGuardia has drawn some recent interest: Close down the decrepit jails on Rikers Island, adjacent to LaGuardia, and use the island for a new runway.\n\nThe Port Authority\u2019s Mr. Cotton says, despite the daily delays, LaGuardia, which has two intersecting runways now, will not need a new runway until at least 2035. The central terminal will remain at 35 gates, the same as today, and takeoff and landing slots will remain controlled. Capacity will grow by airlines using larger planes.\n\nAs for the Rikers Island idea, Mr. Cotton says, \u201cWe are focused on getting the $8 billion project built.\u201d\n\nThe Port Authority is undertaking environmental assessments for an AirTrain that would connect LaGuardia to the Willets Point station on the Long Island Rail Road. Mr. Cotton says that could provide 30-minute trip from midtown to LaGuardia and reduce traffic on highways. Currently only 6% of LaGuardia passengers use public transportation. \u201cCongestion on roads is beyond the pale,\u201d he says.\n\nAirlines have supported the rebuilding projects. Several have overhauled their own terminals at Newark and Kennedy and all have supported the complicated LaGuardia plan.\n\nUpgrades coming to LaGuardia Airport in New York may mean less time waiting for checked bags. Photo: Adrienne Grunwald for The Wall Street Journal\n\nSouthwest Airlines , flying today from perhaps the most cramped quarters in LaGuardia\u2019s main terminal with rows of seats stuffed in a skinny corridor, limited restrooms and almost no concessions, thinks it will get the first new gates.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll change the customer experience from night to day,\u201d says Steve Sisneros, managing director of airport affairs at Southwest. \u201cIt\u2019ll be like coming into Oz.\u201d\n\nCorrections & Amplifications\n\nLaGuardia Airport\u2019s central terminal will have 35 gates once rebuilt, the same number as the existing structure.

At first it was just a single creature, flashing past my face as seven of us, wearing life jackets, helmets and headlamps, bobbed in a shadowy river inside a 3-million-year-old cave in north-central Vietnam.

Cave swimming isn\u2019t for everyone.\n\nI was halfway into a three-day hiking and swimming tour in what is fast becoming one of the world\u2019s most popular caving destinations, a massive limestone formation 300 miles south of Hanoi. Hundreds of caves are carved out of an otherworldly landscape of undulating mountain ranges and isolated karst towers that feels so prehistoric you half expect pterodactyls to come swooping through.\n\nExploring Tu Lan Cave. Photo: Ngo Tran Hai An\n\nSoutheast Asia\u2019s tourist-friendly bounty of caves entered the spotlight last summer, when heavy rain flooded the subterranean chambers that 12 young Thai soccer players and their coach were exploring post-practice, trapping them. Our expedition, run by Oxalis Adventure Tours, was painstakingly laid out by speleologists with extensive experience mapping caves and led by guides trained in first aid and water rescues. Most important, we weren\u2019t in danger of surging waters because Oxalis doesn\u2019t run tours in the rainy season. Cave tourism in Vietnam is a relatively recent phenomenon. British spelunkers started surveying the region in 1990 and discovered the largest known cave passage in the world, Son Doong, in 2009. It\u2019s nearly 4 miles long and tall enough to contain a 40-story building. Oxalis, formed in 2011, started the first trekking and camping expeditions in that cave and several others. Even after the Thai incident, business is thriving for Oxalis and other local cave operators, they say.\n\nI opted for the tour with the most swimming, Oxalis\u2019 Wild Tu Lan Cave Explorer. Our trip began in Phong Nha, a small town on the Son River surrounded by jagged ranges and populated by low-slung hotels and homestays run by locals capitalizing on the growing tourism. After a 90-minute drive northwest to Oxalis\u2019 staging base, our tour guide, Pham Hong Dai, briefed my group, which included three Californians, a banker from Milan and a college student from Da Nang. He told us what was in store: six caves, 10 miles of hiking, 1,000 yards of swimming in four caverns, and two nights camping at waterfalls outside caves. And he offered some crucial bits of advice: Watch for poison ivy and snakes and don\u2019t overtake him. Oxalis provided the caving gear, and porters carried our bags ahead to the first campsite.\n\nTrekking to Tu Lan Caves. Photo: Tobi Schnofeil\n\nIn the 90-degree heat and humidity, we walked from the Oxalis pavilion onto a concrete road built by the makers of \u201cKong: Skull Island,\u201d filmed in the province in 2016, through a valley hemmed by lush peaks. We started with a hike up a mountainside to a dry chamber called Rat Cave, a lair for the movie monster and our setting for lunch. The opening of this dry cave was like a giant shark\u2019s mouth with serrated teeth at the top. Inside, an obelisk-like stalagmite stood sentinel atop a mound decked with moss and neon-green ferns. After lunching on pork spring rolls and dragon fruit spread out on a tarp, we ventured into our first darkened chamber, headlamps exposing thousands of ashen stalactites clinging to the ceiling 50-feet above like icicles coated in cobwebs.\n\nEvery cave featured both tight passages and massive chambers, some as high as 150 feet, often streaked in blues, greens, grays or yellows derived from trace minerals and organic acids. Most of the rooms were encrusted with formations bulging from the walls, dripping from the ceilings and rising from the floor. Recurring shapes reminded me of Doric columns, mushroom clouds and giant squids.\n\n\u201c \u2018The opening of the cave was like a giant shark\u2019s mouth with teeth.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAfter leaving Rat Cave, we hiked two hours down the mountain to our first campsite and our first swim, outside of Ken Cave. There, a one-story waterfall tumbled from the entrance forming our own private swimming hole. I walked straight into the warm emerald pool in pants and shirt before shedding them for a few laps, enamored of the white cliffs encircling the swimming hole. The light dimmed as I swam butterfly 75 meters into the back of the cave\u2019s mouth. Thoughts of a Leviathan dragging me under sent me quickly in reverse, swimming backstroke under massive stalactites hanging two stories above like divebombing dragons. That night, at the campsite, we toasted our adventure with rice-wine shots. In our tents at 8 p.m., we fell asleep to the sounds of screeching insects and crashing water.\n\nThe second day brought swims in three caves. First we were back in Ken, in our shirts, pants, boots, life jackets and helmets, pulling against the slight current. After 150 yards, we climbed out onto a ledge, slowly moving over muddy paths, dry sandy floors and spiky rocks. We came to a 2-foot high stalagmite like a baptismal font. \u201cLights off,\u201d Dai said. We sat on cool clay, listening to drops splashing every few seconds into the round font, leaving behind micro-traces of minerals that form dripstone over millennia. We ended the afternoon by hiking into nearby Kim Cave and into a shallow river. We trekked knee-deep before coming to a small series of rapids, our first waterfall in the dark.\n\nSwimmin in Hung Ton Cave. Photo: Oxalis Adventures\n\nOn the third day, we entered our final cave, Ton. We swam through narrow passages that resembled canyon gorges, a few feet wide and 30 feet high, against the strongest current of the trip. \u201cI thought you were going to pick an easy one for the end,\u201d said Carlos Morales, one of the Californians, to Dai as we trudged out of the watery entrance. A quartet of white butterflies fluttered toward a path leading to an hour-long hike down to the valley, to showers and cold beer.\n\nTHE LOWDOWN / Spelunking in Vietnam\n\nGetting There: Vietnam\u2019s most popular caves are in mountainous Quang Binh Province. As a base, most tourists use the town of Phong Nha, about an hour drive from the nearest airport, Dong Hoi, which can be reached via multiple daily flights from Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi (baolau.com). From Da Nang, you can also take a picturesque, six-hour train ride along coastal cliffs north to Dong Hoi.\n\nCaving There: International speleologists attribute Vietnam\u2019s outstanding caves to the abundance of thick limestone and warm water. Heavy rains in the fall mean the best caving months are February through August, and swimming is ideal in late summer when river temperatures are around 80 degrees. You can spend a few hours or a few days in the caves in and around Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage site. Paradise and Phong Nha caves are mammoth, so-called show caves where thousands of visitors descend daily to tour from walkways or boats. Multiple-day tours are run by three companies\u2014Oxalis Adventure Tours, Jungle Boss and Greenland Tours\u2014each with government concessions to operate in separate caves. The tours are small, generally two to 16 customers, and operators provide van rides, caving gear and meals. Oxalis offers 11 tours ranging from one day in Nuoc Nut Cave for about $70 to four days in Son Doong, with guests camping inside the world\u2019s largest known cave passage, for $3,000 per person. The best swimming is on the Wild Tu Lan Cave Explorer, with two nights jungle camping, for $350. There is no cellphone service or electricity in the jungle so bring a power pack for charging.\n\nStaying There: Rooms in the growing number of guest houses along Phong Nha\u2019s main road range from $15 to $30 a night. One of the few luxury offerings, Victory Road Villas opened in 2017 on the bank of the Son River with seven apartments in a fusion of French colonial and Vietnamese styles (from $150 a night; victoryroadvillas.com). Oxalis also runs Chay Lap Farmstay, a landscaped retreat with 39 rooms and cottages and a water sports complex on the river, where you can kayak and swim; it\u2019s about a 20-minute drive from Phong Nha town (from $55 a night; chaylapfarmstay.com).

Photo: Matt Rourke/Associated Press\n\nCharlotte, N.C.\n\nEric Reid should have been celebrating after the Panthers beat the Buccaneers earlier this month. Carolina won by two touchdowns. Reid had an interception. He was given a game ball.\n\nBut Reid, the Panthers safety, wasn\u2019t satisfied at his locker after the game. \u201cWe took our team photo yesterday, and I couldn\u2019t even smile,\u201d Reid said in an interview. \u201cI\u2019m living my dream. And they\u2019ve taken his away.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u201d are the NFL\u2019s team owners, and the \u201chis\u201d refers to Reid\u2019s close friend and former teammate with the San Francisco 49ers, Colin Kaepernick. In 2016, Reid and Kaepernick together catalyzed a movement in which NFL players protested during the national anthem to draw attention to social injustices and racial inequality.\n\nIf Kaepernick has been the face of the players\u2019 demonstrations, Reid has lingered as the enduring voice of the movement\u2014even as the fervor surrounding the topic has subsided after two tumultuous seasons in which the issue divided the league and dented its popularity.\n\nKaepernick has been unable to secure another job playing in the NFL; Reid, after waiting until weeks into the regular season, has caught on in Carolina and continues to kneel during the national anthem. Kaepernick has said almost nothing publicly about the situation as he pursues legal action against the league. Reid has persistently asserted his beliefs with vigor, attacking owners and grousing about fellow players even though he knows it could cost him down the road.\n\nReid says the men always understood their actions could have consequences. \u201cMe and Colin knew that from the beginning,\u201d Reid said. \u201cWe talked at length about what we wanted to do, and how we wanted to use our platform...We knew the potential backlash that would come with it.\u201d\n\nKaepernick alleges that backlash manifested itself in the form of the league effectively blackballing him because of his outspoken political views. Kaepernick has gone unsigned for the last two seasons and last year filed a grievance against the league and its teams saying they colluded to keep him unsigned.\n\nSan Francisco 49ers safety Eric Reid, left, and quarterback Colin Kaepernick prior to a game in 2016. Photo: Marcio Jose Sanchez/Associated Press\n\nReid, 26 years old, was a first-round pick by the 49ers in the 2013 draft and made the Pro Bowl as a rookie. He began protesting alongside Kaepernick in 2016 and became a free agent after the end of last season. After going unsigned, he filed a grievance similar to Kaepernick\u2019s.\n\nThe league has declined to comment on Kaepernick and Reid\u2019s grievances, citing the confidentiality of the process. The NFL\u2019s request for a summary judgment in Kaepernick\u2019s case and to have it dismissed was denied by the arbitrator. A separate grievance filed on behalf of Reid by the NFL Players Association, which alleged a team violated the collective bargaining agreement by asking about Reid\u2019s intention to protest during the free-agency protest, was denied by an arbitrator. The NFLPA said it was \u201cdisappointed\u201d in the ruling.\n\nThe two confidants trained together all off-season. By 5 a.m., they would be on a field in New Jersey. Then they returned to New York for another set of workouts. Reid, a defensive back, would also go through drills as a wide receiver to help Kaepernick train.\n\n\u201cThey really had each other\u2019s backs throughout all of this,\u201d said Josh Hidalgo, their trainer. \u201cWe knew that when an opportunity came, we had to be ready. We couldn\u2019t miss. We knew he had to be in absolute tip-top shape.\u201d\n\nKaepernick\u2019s phone never rang, but Reid\u2019s did: In late September, after the season had started, the Panthers signed him to a one-year deal.\n\nThis season, the players\u2019 demonstrations have become more muted. During the past off-season, the league implemented and then rescinded a policy that would require players to stand during the anthem amid sharp condemnation from players and their representatives.\n\nBut only a handful of players across the league have continued to either take a knee or raise a fist during the national anthem to call attention to issues such as police brutality. Meanwhile, President Trump\u2014who inflamed the issue last year by assailing the protests as unpatriotic\u2014has been mostly silent on the topic this season.\n\nIn that vacuum, Reid has stood out as the steadfast and outspoken critic.\n\nHe has launched barbs not just at owners, but also players he disagrees with. Reid was among players who met with owners last year to discuss initiatives in which both parties could use their resources to help the African-American community.\n\nPanthers safety Eric Reid, left, takes a knee during the national anthemprior to a game on Oct. 14. Photo: Jeff Siner/Charlotte Observer/TNS/Zuma Press\n\nSome players, such as Philadelphia defensive back Malcolm Jenkins, stopped protesting after the talks from that session led to a social justice partnership between players and owners. Reid earlier this season dubbed Jenkins a \u201csellout\u201d and \u201cneo-colonialist,\u201d and said that Jenkins called him to ask how much money, donated to his causes, it would take for Reid to stop protesting.\n\nJenkins, responding to Reid\u2019s remarks in October, said he didn\u2019t want to \u201ctalk bad about somebody who I knew was generally out to help other people.\u201d\n\nReid has also delivered blunt assessments of owners, whom he has portrayed as just being interested in ending the demonstrations. Reid said that during the players-owners meeting last year, Bills owner Terry Pegula raised concerns from sponsors and remarked: \u201cWe need to put a Band-Aid on this, and we need a black figurehead to do it.\u201d A Bills spokesman didn\u2019t have a comment.\n\nThe Panthers signed Reid in September after veteran safety Da\u2019Norris Searcy was placed on injured reserve. \u201cI\u2019m going to stand by him,\u201d Cam Newton, the team\u2019s quarterback, said after Reid signed. \u201cWe got a steal.\u201d For the Panthers, who are 6-3, Reid has emerged as a key cog in the defensive backfield.\n\nBut Reid has suggested, not too subtly, that he is still being targeted for punishment. After a game in which Reid was ejected for a hit on Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, Reid said the ejection wasn\u2019t warranted and indicated he has been tapped for an inordinate number of random drug tests since joining the team. An NFL spokesman responded by reiterating the procedure for randomly selecting players for tests.\n\nPanthers safety Eric Reid intercepts a pass during a game against Tampa Bay. Photo: Ed Clemente/Zuma Press\n\nReid says the Panthers haven\u2019t asked him to tone down his commentary\u2014and that if they did, he wouldn\u2019t. During the off-season, the Panthers were sold to billionaire hedge fund founder David Tepper in the wake of misconduct allegations against Jerry Richardson, who had owned the team since its founding.\n\nReid\u2019s grievance against the league from last season is still in process, as is Kaepernick\u2019s. After Panthers games, Reid is left to wonder why a team was willing to sign him but not his close friend.\n\nOne theory is that, as a quarterback and the originator of the movement, Kaepernick is simply more polarizing than Reid.

Pajamas, dressing gowns, bras and slips\u2014clothing that once remained mostly unseen\u2014have crossed from the private to the public sphere. The bride in question, humanitarian worker Sonia Joly, was married in Cannes in 2017 wearing ivory silk pajamas by the Sleeper, a brand that calls its designs \u201cwalking sleepwear.\u201d In a subtler but still telling display of bridal lounge-iness, when influencer and blogger Chiara Ferragni, aka the Blonde Salad, got married recently, one of her two Christian Dior haute couture wedding dresses featured the brand\u2019s meant-to-be seen logo-printed bra straps.\n\nBrides presumably pay a fair amount of attention to their appearances. And so the examples of Ms. Joly and Ms. Ferragni suggest that fashion\u2019s rules restricting what women can wear in public have been pretty thoroughly trounced. Of course, these rules have been more or less ignored for years; college students are notorious for showing up for class in some version of what they wore to bed, and I doubt if any of these undergraduates worries much about visible bra straps. But the trend is not limited to millennial influencer-types: Style eminences Grace Coddington and Betsey Johnson, both in their 70s, regularly appear at public events in pajamas and petticoats, respectively.\n\n\u201c \u2018Clothing once mostly unseen\u2014dressing gowns, bras, slips\u2014crossed from the private to the public sphere.\u2019 \u201d\n\nMoreover, designers have fully embraced the 24-hour pajama party. Some brands, like the aforementioned the Sleeper, Fleur du Mal and Attico, were founded expressly to make all-day lounge wear. For others, lounge wear is simply a new form of day wear. Marc Jacobs, for example, recently rereleased his entire 1993 Perry Ellis grunge collection, which included several slip dresses. Catherine Holstein, creative director of Khaite, likes to wear bras as tops in warm weather (\u201cI\u2019m a little more naked than the average person in summer,\u201d she deadpanned), pairing them with modest skirts or trousers for balance. Riffing on her personal style for her coming spring collection, she\u2019s created bra-style silk and lace tops.\n\nSLIP INTO SOMETHING MORE COMFORTABLE / Pieces With Lingerie Detailing Clockwise from left: Dress, $2,620, Stella McCartney, 212-320-8350; Chloe Skirt, $1,995, The Webster, 212-226-1260; Brock Collection Top, $740, Elyse Walker, 310-230-8882; Cardigan, $370, sandro-paris.com Belt, $1,370, maison-alaia.com\n\nGiven that we live in an era of unbridled sharing, when near-strangers on a plane think nothing of pulling out their phones and showing you personal photos, there is little surprising in the idea that some wish to reveal their underpinnings. But there was a time when the line between private and public was unyielding and those who crossed it faced censure.\n\nThat\u2019s what happened to Marie Antoinette, one of the first women to wear her underwear in public. In 1783, she sat for a portrait by painter \u00c9lisabeth Vig\u00e9e Le Brun wearing a white muslin chemise-like gown\u2014the chemise being an item of clothing that many 18th-century women wore next to their skin, underneath their corsets and outer clothing. It was how Marie Antoinette and her friends dressed at her private refuge, Le Petit Trianon, where she went to escape the formality of Versailles, and was apparently a style they adopted from women in the French Caribbean, who wore chemise gowns in the heat. To modern eyes, Marie Antoinette looks pretty and natural in her filmy dress. To her subjects, her casual appearance was an affront to the dignity of the French royal family (hecklers protested the painting) and yet another strike against an already unpopular queen.\n\nMoving ahead into the 20th century, an important blurring of the boundary between private and public was crossed in the 1930s, when designers such as Madeleine Vionnet and Madame Gr\u00e8s explored the bias cut, a signature of slips. By delineating the precise contours of the body, bias-cut dresses revealed what had previously been private. The eye adjusted, and the idea of the exposed body began to seem less shocking.\n\nBut women didn\u2019t start wearing their actual underwear as outerwear until the 1980s, when the corset and bra top trend took off, with Madonna as chief instigator, aided and abetted by designers such as Jean Paul Gaultier. These styles were both rigid in their construction and, in their reminiscence of the hourglass shapes of the 1950s, in their designers\u2019 vision of what the ideal body should look like.\n\nIn contrast, the new lounge wear is soft and unstructured, and it\u2019s not designed with any particular body in mind. In launching the Sleeper, said the brand\u2019s co-founder Asya Varetsa, \u201cwe were inspired by our own ideas of beauty. Our girl doesn\u2019t care about other people\u2019s ideas of what she should be wearing.\u201d\n\nTo Ms. Holstein, loungewear is the dressed-up evolution of athleisure. \u201cI think we\u2019re trending back to more elegant dressing but people don\u2019t want to give up comfort,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is refined but still relaxed.\u201d\n\nComfort is the crux of the lounge wear revolution. Comfort as the raison d\u2019\u00eatre of getting dressed, comfort with the idea of no boundaries, comfort as a permanent state of mind.\n\nThe question is: Are you comfortable with that?", "The now-defunct Florida company where Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker served as a paid advisory-board member once posted a promotional video featuring someone who has since risen to even greater heights in the administration: Donald Trump.\n\nIt is the latest twist in the story of World Patent Marketing Inc., which has attracted a sudden spotlight since Mr. Trump appointed Mr. Whitaker to lead the Justice Department last week after former Attorney General Jeff Sessions was ousted.
