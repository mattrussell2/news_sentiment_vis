My husband and I bond over journeys to often-barren areas, visiting works by mostly dead architects.\n\nWhen we were engaged in Rio de Janeiro 17 years ago, we vowed to someday visit Bras\u00edlia, some 700 miles away, the planned metropolis which became the nation\u2019s new capital in 1960. Championed in 1955 by democratically elected President Juscelino Kubitschek and conceived by urban planner L\u00facio Costa with fellow-Brazilian and architect Oscar Niemeyer (1907-2012), the city was intended to embody optimism, progress and civic engagement. When it was inaugurated five years later, its modernist structures upended all notions of functional architecture. \u201cI feel I have just disembarked upon another planet, not Earth,\u201d Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin said upon first seeing Bras\u00edlia.\n\nIn the decades since our engagement, my husband and I renovated four apartments, each more modernist than the last, but never to our total satisfaction: Leather Poul Kjaerholm chairs read too masculine, guests could injure themselves on the many right angles. We decided it was time to visit Bras\u00edlia.\n\nAs we rode in from the airport, a skyline awash in white arose from the red savanna. Within the city of 2.5 million, waterfalls flowed from concrete troughs cantilevered off the Palace of Justice\u2019s facade. Twin stone towers\u2014clearly kin to the United Nations Secretariat in New York, of which Niemeyer was a primary architect\u2014soared behind the horizontal main building of the National Congress. The presidential Planalto Palace seemed to glide atop a moat, its flat roof held up by structural beams that, to Niemeyer\u2019s eye, mimicked falling feathers.\n\nNiemeyer\u2019s National Congress Palace has become a symbol of Brazil. Photo: Getty Images\n\nNearby, 16 stark-white paraboloid beams supported the Metropolitan Cathedral of Bras\u00edlia like a crown of thorns. Inside, sculpted angels dangled from the ceiling\u2019s apex, and indigo light flooded the house of worship as it filtered through windows patterned with blue and green waves. Niemeyer once wrote, \u201cI am attracted to free-flowing, sensual curves\u2026that I find in the mountains of my country, in the sinuousness of its rivers, in the waves of the ocean and on the body of the beloved woman.\u201d Standing beneath those arches, I grasped that faithful modernism can include color and curves, and I made a mental note: Get some throw pillows.\n\nBras\u00edlia\u2019s sense of postwar possibility still pervades the planned city. I found myself literally skipping along the Monumental Axis. \u201cThere is an irony to these palaces,\u201d said Patricio del Real, assistant professor of art and architecture at Harvard University. \u201cThey express an anti-monumentality that makes us question the need for heaviness and grand statements in civic settings at all.\u201d\n\nPerhaps I\u2019ll need more than pillows. I\u2019ve been outbid (or chickened out) many times when pondering the purchase of the Rio Modern Chaise (shown below). It and other furnishings by Niemeyer and contemporaries such as Sergio Rodrigues, Joaquim Tenreiro and Lina Bo Bardi continue to climb in value. But newer designers offer fresh takes on the Bras\u00edlia aesthetic. Alain Gilles\u2019 just-released W8 side table for Ligne Roset nods to Niemeyer. \u201cThe stone weight at the base has a concave shape that can be found on buildings such as the National Congress,\u201d said Mr. Gilles, while the curve of metal supporting the tablet recalls the Planalto Palace.\n\nSince returning, my husband and I have softened our over-disciplined apartment. Any day now, a sensual orange Vladimir Kagan Serpentine sofa will arrive. The throw pillows I\u2019d pledged to buy brighten the kids\u2019 couch. A new sense of levity warms our home. \u201cIt isn\u2019t enough to just be rational,\u201d wrote Niemeyer. \u201cIt must also be beautiful.\u201d\n\nCURVES AHEAD / Non-Linear Designs to Round Out D\u00e9cor\n\nClockwise from top left: Reflect Pillow, $80, cb2.com; Alain Gilles W8 Occasional Table, $850, Ligne Roset, 212-357-1036; Gert-Jen Soepenberg Vase #1, $214, ateliergertjan.com; Global Views Corona Candle Holder, $199, perigold.com; Oscar Niemeyer Rio Modern Chaise, $27,410, 1stdibs.com", "WASHINGTON\u2014Marcia Lee Kelly, one of President Trump\u2019s top aides in the White House, is leaving the West Wing and is expected to become chief executive of the 2020 Republican Party convention, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nLouis DeJoy, a Trump fundraiser, is likely to be named finance chairman of the convention, which will be held in his home state of North Carolina, the people said.\n\nMs....", "Two people call customer service at the same time to complain about the same thing.

GM 0.56% is winding down a car-subscription service it rolled out nearly two years ago for Cadillac, underscoring the challenges traditional car makers face as they try to diversify into new transportation offerings.\n\nThe Book by Cadillac service\u2014available in Los Angeles, Dallas and New York\u2014will shut down operations by the end of this year, according to people briefed on the plan. Subscribers paying $1,800 a month for access to Cadillac\u2019s model lineup will have 30 days from the time they are notified to turn their vehicles in, these people said.\n\nThe subscription plan, launched early last year, lets members swap in and out of different Cadillac models for the monthly fee, providing an alternative for customers who might not want to make the long-term commitment of buying or leasing a car.\n\nA GM spokesman confirmed the service was ending but said it could restart later. \u201cWe are hitting the pause button for a brief time to make some tweaks to Book [by Cadillac] based on our learnings,\u201d the spokesman said.\n\nA letter prepared this week for subscribers in New York said Book by Cadillac would close its program in that city Dec. 1 and included an offer to purchase or lease a new Cadillac, a person who reviewed the letter said.\n\nSome aspects of Cadillac\u2019s program proved more costly than expected, people familiar with the program said. Snags with the back-end technology used to support the service made some customer-service functions tedious and time-consuming, adding costs for the company, these people said.\n\nMany car companies have introduced subscription plans in the past year, betting people are interested in treating personal transportation much like a Netflix account.\n\nAuto executives are worried that the century-old model of customers buying and repairing their own cars will lose ground to ride-hailing services, such as Uber Technologies Inc., and other forms of transportation. Many auto makers are teaming up with tech startups to launch new smartphone-based apps that give customers new options for getting around, such as hailing driverless cars in the future.\n\nCadillac was among the first brands to offer a subscription plan. Since its March 2017 launch, Porsche AG , Daimler AG\u2019s Mercedes-Benz, Volvo AB and other premium brands have followed Cadillac\u2019s lead, launching similar plans that allow subscribers to drive different models for a monthly rate.\n\nThe move comes as GM clamps down on costs amid slowing sales in two of its largest markets, China and the U.S. The Detroit auto maker this week sent buyout offers to more than a third of its 50,000 employees in North America, an effort to shrink its cost base while the economy and car market remain strong, the company said.\n\nThe car-subscription model is still in its infancy, and many brands now limit the service to only a few cities and several dozen subscribers. Hyundai Motor Co. recently discontinued its subscription service for electric cars, but said it plans to reintroduce a revamped version.\n\n\u201cThe hype surrounding subscriptions as the next big wave of car ownership has yet to materialize,\u201d said Ivan Drury, senior analyst with automotive website Edmunds.com.\n\nCadillac\u2019s subscription service lets customers pay month-to month without a long-term commitment. They can order cars via their smartphone, swapping models up to 18 times a year. It couldn\u2019t be learned how many subscribers Cadillac had enrolled.\n\nAnalysts say having customers rotate in and out of cars regularly can be hard to manage. The logistics of repairing damaged cars, cleaning them between uses and delivering them within 24 hours are tedious and expensive, analysts and operators say.\n\nCadillac also offers other services as part of the subscription plan, such as at-home vehicle drop-off, that are difficult to pull off on a wider scale, Mr. Drury said.\n\n\u201cSome of these services will even transfer your stuff from car to car, from your phone charger to your kid\u2019s stroller,\u201d Mr. Drury said. \u201cThe problems posed in offering that level of service at scale are vast.\u201d\n\nSubscriptions typically allow subscribers to switch vehicles a few times a month and can range from $650 a month to more than $3,000 a month, depending on the auto maker, analysts say. Most plans include insurance and the company handles repairs and routine maintenance like oil changes.\n\nMercedes-Benz\u2019s MB Collection program, for example, offers about a dozen models. Monthly monthly rates range from $1,095 to $2,995.\n\nIn most cases, though, consumers end up paying thousands of dollars more over the long run to subscribe to the service than if they leased a car, according to Edmunds.\n\nFor example, leasing a Cadillac Escalade sport-utility vehicle for three years would cost around $49,000, Edmunds estimates. The cost of subscribing to Cadillac\u2019s Book service over that period would top $64,000, the firm said.\n\nStartup companies are offering subscriptions that give members access to vehicles from car brands including Atlanta-based Clutch Technologies, acquired in August by privately owned Cox Automotive Inc., which sells services to dealerships.\n\nSome dealership groups also have begun offering subscription service. A service called Flexdrive is jointly owned by Cox and Holman Automotive, a large dealership group based in New Jersey.\n\nWrite to Mike Colias at Mike.Colias@wsj.com", "When New Yorker Jen Winston connected last month with Spencer from Georgia on Tinder, finding true love wasn\u2019t her priority.\n\n\u201cWhy are you so far away from me?\u201d Spencer messaged Ms. Winston on the swipe-based dating app.\n\n\u201cAbsence makes the heart grow fonder,\u201d she replied. \u201cAnyway, are you voting for Stacey Abrams?\u201d she asked, referring to the Democratic candidate for governor of Georgia.\n\nBlue romance?\n\nWith the midterms fast approaching, and young people generally less likely than those older to vote, apps and events typically used for finding romance are instead being deployed by those who want to entice their fellow citizens to come to a polling station.\n\nMs. Winston, a writer and speaker, realized a few weeks ago she could change her location to chat with voters in swing states, even if hers wasn\u2019t the pickup line most expected.\n\nShe said she has swiped right and matched with 18 people in states with high-stakes races, including in Nevada, Arizona and North Dakota, as well as Georgia.

Others sent photos of themselves wearing a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat, a sign that her attempts to politically woo them weren\u2019t successful.\n\nWith younger people harder to reach through the traditional methods of landline phones and mail, political strategists are trying to reach the next generation where they are: online and looking for love. Dating apps typically don\u2019t take much time or money, always a boon for campaigns and less-official volunteers.\n\nDavid Goss, the founder of TrumpSingles.com, a dating site for supporters of President Trump, said Democrats are welcome to use the site if they are there for romance and not to troll political opponents.

And for years, employees bought in.\n\nOn Thursday, however, workers of the Alphabet Inc. unit who took part in a walkout at the company\u2019s offices around the world signaled a crisis in faith\u2014one that, if widespread, could cause reputational harm, potentially affecting Google\u2019s standing as an aspirational workplace, risk experts and analysts said.\n\n\u201cI definitely thought Google was a company that was holding itself to a higher moral standard,\u201d said Jon Cohen, a 28-year-old Google software engineer in New York, who took part in Thursday\u2019s protest. \u201cThe last year or so, it\u2019s just been shown to be untrue.\u201d\n\nRecent employee activism at Google has been in response to a New York Times article last week, which detailed how the company protected three senior executives over the past decade after they were accused of sexual misconduct, including one who received a $90 million exit package in 2014. Google declined to comment on details in the Times story.\n\nEmployees said they were protesting a workplace culture they felt protected perpetrators of sexual misconduct. Many voiced anger and disappointment in a company they once thought was different from other big corporations.\n\nMr. Cohen and others also have taken issue with the company\u2019s efforts to work with the Chinese government to build a censored search engine.\n\nThat has added to his anger, he said. Suddenly, Google was \u201cnot being the kind of company that I thought it was when I joined it,\u201d Mr. Cohen said.\n\nOrganizers asked the company to improve transparency in the reporting and handling of sexual misconduct, \u201cend pay and opportunity inequity,\u201d and elevate the role of the chief diversity officer.\n\nHow Google responds is critical for a company \u201cbuilt on human capital and nothing else,\u201d said John Wilson, Cornerstone Capital Group\u2019s head of research and corporate governance.\n\n\u201cGoogle hires people who can work anywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cSo if employees don\u2019t trust the company will have their backs, it will impact Google\u2019s ability to attract, retain and motivate employees.\u201d\n\nWhen asked for comment, Google sent a video of an interview with Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai.\n\n\u201cAt Google we set a very, very high bar and we clearly didn\u2019t live up to our expectations,\u201d he said in the interview, which was conducted Thursday at a New York Times conference. \u201cAnd which is why we felt it was important to express our support for the employees today.\n\n\u201cAnd the first step you take in these things is to acknowledge and apologize for past actions, for the pain they caused,\u201d he added.\n\nThe spotlight on Google is particularly bright because the company has made its culture such a significant part of its allure, said Anthony Johndrow, chief executive of consultancy Reputation Economy Advisors.\n\n\u201cThey built this mythology as being this great place to work and used that to build their external reputation,\u201d Mr. Johndrow said. \u201cYou need to get it right in-house first, and that is coming home to bite them pretty hard.\u201d\n\nThe situation highlights how crucial internal reputation can be to a company. A recent study by management consulting company Accenture PLC calculated a perceived material loss of trust from stakeholders, including employees, had cost more than half of the companies analyzed as much as $180 billion in revenue.\n\n\u201cIf you want a high performance culture, you need a high trust culture,\u201d Mr. Wilson said. \u201cUltimately, there has to be trust in the people you work with every day with and that starts at the top.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cAny sign that the company is mistreating its employees will impact that trust. Consumers are buying an image as much as a product. We\u2019re talking about a company whose motto is: \u2018Don\u2019t be evil.\u2019\u201d\n\nThomas Kneeland, a Google software engineer, said there is a sense among employees that they work at a special place with a mission to change the world. But he acknowledged at Thursday\u2019s protest in New York that there was \u201cwidespread frustration and deep-seated anger\u201d in the ranks.\n\n\u201cI hope this gives us momentum,\u201d he said. \u201cIf all we did was stand around for an hour and nothing changes it would not be worth it.

Mr. Kelly wanted to thank him for \u201cThe Right Stuff,\u201d my father\u2019s 1979 book about the early U.S. space program, which had inspired his career as an astronaut, Mr. Kelly told me.\n\nMr. Kelly, now 54, was at the end of a yearlong mission to the space station. When he returned to Earth, he met my father, who passed away in May, for a few meals and asked him for advice on how to write about his experience. \u201cBegin at the beginning,\u201d my father told him.\n\nMr. Kelly took it to heart. Last year, he published a memoir, \u201cEndurance.\u201d And this past week, he came out with \u201cInfinite Wonder,\u201d which illustrates his year in orbit with a series of vivid photographs that he took of the Earth as it passed below.\n\nMr. Kelly has been to space four times, starting in 1999 with a mission piloting the Space Shuttle Discovery to service the Hubble Space Telescope and ending in 2016 with his trip to the international space station. During his NASA career, he spent a total of 520 days in space, the record for an American astronaut (since broken) at the time he retired from spaceflight in 2016. He still holds the U.S. record for the most days spent in space at one time\u2014340.\n\nHis feats were as much mental as physical. To prepare for spending such a long time in high-pressure, cramped conditions on his last mission, he lived in an undersea laboratory in Key Largo for two weeklong stints and spent about a week in a freezing snow cave in Wyoming. He met regularly with a psychiatrist with whom he spoke every few weeks from the space station. \u201cI definitely think I developed a talent for living in an uncomfortable environment,\u201d he says. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean I like to fly in economy class on an airline,\u201d he jokes, \u201cbut I can if I have to.\u201d\n\nAs a child growing up in West Orange, New Jersey, Mr. Kelly and his twin brother Mark (also an astronaut and the husband of former Arizona congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords) were energetic and rebellious. \u201cWe had two speeds, fast and stop,\u201d he says. His father was a police officer, and his mother eventually became one, too.\n\nMr. Kelly first read \u201cThe Right Stuff\u201d while in college at the State University of New York Maritime College, where he earned a degree in electrical engineering in 1987. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t just an exciting adventure story,\u201d he wrote in his memoir. \u201cThis was more like a life plan.\u201d\n\nMr. Kelly took pictures to help scientists observe environmental changes and document natural disasters. Photo: Winni Wintermeyer for The Wall Street Journal\n\nHe joined the Navy, where he served as a fighter pilot and test pilot until NASA chose him to be an astronaut in 1996. \u201cI never felt more rewarded in work\u2026than when I was doing something that had very serious consequences of not doing it correctly,\u201d he says.\n\nIn space, he learned to function in zero gravity. Any time he made a movement as small as pushing a button, he had to anchor himself with a foot or toe, and he had to secure objects such as forks and knives with Velcro. Fluid that would normally have settled in his lower body pooled in his head, giving him an uncomfortably full feeling in his skull.\n\nBut none of it stopped him from marveling at the sights below. He started photographing earth from space in earnest in 2010, during a 159-day flight, finding ways to support himself and his camera without gravity as the space station moved past the planet at 17,500 miles an hour. \u201cI had to pan the camera steadily and quickly as the shutter released, otherwise the image would smear and appear out of focus,\u201d he writes. He used a long 800 mm lens with a 1.4x magnifying zoom lens and then used software to enhance the color.\n\nDuring his last mission, he took some pictures to help scientists observe environmental changes and document natural disasters. The photos in his new book range from the veined landscapes of Egyptian deserts to the vibrant blues and greens of the Bahamas. \u201cI really liked taking those photos\u2026that made Earth look like abstract art,\u201d he says.\n\nHe took most of his photographs for fun. During football season, he tried to take photos of stadiums during games and managed to get a shot of Super Bowl 50 in California. He also shot locations where people he missed lived.\n\nHe undertook several dangerous spacewalks to fix parts of the space station, putting him at risk of becoming untethered as he struggled to move in his ungainly suit. The worst part of his journey, he says, was getting bad news from earth. He had two months left in his 159-day mission in 2011 when he found out that his sister-in-law Ms. Giffords had been shot at an event in Tucson. At first he heard that she had died; only hours later did he find out that she had survived. From space, he led a moment of silence for his crew and flight control centers around the world.\n\nSince retiring, Mr. Kelly has devoted most of his time to writing and giving speeches, which he finds enough to keep him busy for now. He and his wife Amiko have decided to give up their home in Houston and travel, staying in hotels, Airbnbs and the occasional tent or yurt, such as when they visited Everest Base Camp. He has two daughters from his previous marriage.\n\nMr. Kelly thinks that someday soon we\u2019ll be able to fly halfway around the world in 45 minutes by going up briefly to space and descending again, and he thinks that human travel to Mars is \u201cinevitable.\u201d Given the chance, would he go? \u201cYup,\u201d he says, without hesitation.\n\nAs I got off the phone with Mr. Kelly, I remembered a line that was one of my father\u2019s favorites. Instead of saying goodbye, he liked to say \u201cKeep \u2019em flying!\u201d\u2014a slogan from a 1941 recruiting ad for the Aviation Cadet Program. True to form, when he got that surprising email from space, he thanked Mr. Kelly for \u201cwriting this earthling way down below\u201d and signed off, \u201cKeep \u2019em orbiting!\u201d\n\nWrite to Alexandra Wolfe at alexandra.wolfe@wsj.com", "CAIRO\u2014Egyptian security forces arrested at least 19 human-rights lawyers and activists this week in raids that reflect the country\u2019s security state is widening its assault on government critics in an attempt to eliminate any challenge to President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi.\n\nEven against the backdrop of years of government repression, this week\u2019s arrests were striking because of the large number of people held and the detention of prominent human-rights lawyers\n\n...", "Alibaba is known as a Chinese tech giant, but at its core the company is a platform for small and medium-sized businesses that sell to Chinese consumers.\n\nThose businesses are suffering from the crackdown on shadow banking in China and the subsequent economic slowdown.

Outwardly cool when she can manage to be, Marie lives a life of inward terror on the border between high-strung and unstrung; she\u2019s a figure of anguishing contradictions and exemplary courage. But there\u2019s another reason to see this very good, albeit flawed, film. It\u2019s about someone who repeatedly risked her life to perform an act of faith\u2014reporting from the world\u2019s most dangerous war zones in the belief that her readers would care about the suffering she recounted. I don\u2019t want to level accusations of saintliness at the producers and filmmakers\u2014everyone has their own reasons, just as Colvin did\u2014but financing and creating such a film in an increasingly crass marketplace, and an ever more violent world, is itself an act of faith that deserves support.\n\nThe director was Matthew Heineman, in his feature debut, working from Arash Amel\u2019s adaptation of \u201cMarie Colvin\u2019s Private War,\u201d a Vanity Fair article by Marie Brenner. Mr. Heineman is no stranger to the subject of journalism. He directed a superb nonfiction feature, \u201cCity of Ghosts,\u201d about an improvised news organization trying, in 2014, to document atrocities inflicted by Islamic State foot soldiers on the Syrian city of Raqqa. Much of his new film has a strong documentary feel\u2014the cinematographer was the distinguished, and distinctive, Robert Richardson\u2014though some of the dramatic writing is clumsily formulaic and over-explanatory. (We would understand, without being told by another character, that Marie is addicted to danger.)\n\nWhen we first meet her the year is 2001 and the place is London, where Marie is imploring her editors at the Sunday Times to send her to Sri Lanka, where a conflict is raging between government forces and Tamil guerrillas. There she writes, in what amounts to her personal mission statement, \u201cThere are people dying here and nobody knows it\u2019s happening.\u201d Then she loses an eye to head injuries sustained in a firefight. (A wealth of clips featuring the real-life Marie Colvin can be found on YouTube, and another film, opening November 16, a documentary called \u201cUnder the Wire,\u201d focuses on her and the photographer Paul Conroy, who was working with her when she died in Homs.)\n\nRosamund Pike as Marie Colvin Photo: Aviron Pictures\n\nIn the course of this film Marie reports from combat zones in Iraq and Afghanistan before plunging into the powerfully visualized chaos of Syria, and consumes toxic amounts of alcohol and tobacco in the process, despite the pleadings of those who admire, assist and love her. (The supporting cast includes Jamie Dornan, who plays Conroy, as well as Tom Hollander, Stanley Tucci, and J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Laheurte as R\u00e9mi Ochlik, the photojournalist who died in the same bombardment that killed Marie Colvin.)

Who wrote the code? Who did it first? And then who did it better?\n\nTo be sure, there\u2019s plenty of tech jargon in Brian McCullough\u2019s \u201cHow the Internet Happened.\u201d You can find out who got the first iPhone call and who posted the first YouTube video. Yet Mr. McCullough takes a broader view, showing how a handful of powerful companies\u2014all of them American, in his telling\u2014came to dominate web technology. In his story, the internet didn\u2019t happen only because of wizardly coding and cheaper computers. It also happened because of serendipity, failure, friendships and blood feuds. And through it all a rainfall of cash (from venture capitalists, Wall Street and individual shareholders) eased a glide path to success.\n\nPhoto: WSJ\n\nHow the Internet Happened By Brian McCullough\n\nLiveright, 371 pages, $28.95\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nThe seminal event\u2014the \u201cbig bang,\u201d in Mr. McCullough\u2019s view\u2014was the Netscape IPO on Aug. 9, 1995, when the stock of a fairly obscure company peddling a seemingly arcane product went on sale. By the end of the first day, a corporation that had no significant profits was worth $2.1 billion. If you followed the IPO when it occurred, or if you enjoyed Michael Lewis\u2019s \u201cThe New New Thing\u201d (1999), Mr. McCullough\u2019s retelling might seem over-familiar. Indeed, some readers might see Mr. McCullough\u2019s history as too obvious, as we move from the Netscape techquake to the succession of entrepreneurs who became rich and famous in the years just after. We all know the names: Jeff Bezos, Steve Case, Jerry Yang, Pierre Omidyar, Larry Page, Mark Zuckerberg. We all know their stories. Or at least we believe we do.\n\nYet Mr. McCullough\u2019s book adds to our understanding by explaining how startups\u2019 histories were interlocked and how entrepreneurs and CEOs battled one another not only on a technological and cultural playing field but in the financial markets too. The business clashes were fierce, with Yahoo rejecting offers from Microsoft, and Google (and later Facebook) rejecting overtures from Yahoo. Every web entrepreneur seemed both cocky and paranoid. Meanwhile, almost everybody lived in fear of that eminent philanthropist Bill Gates, who never hesitated to crush a competitor or acquire an upstart. Yet when entrepreneurs did manage to avoid the dark lord of Redmond, their company\u2019s growth could be astounding. \u201cIn the twelve months of 1998,\u201d Mr. McCullough reminds us, \u201cYahoo stock returned 584%, AOL 593% and Amazon 970%.\u201d In fact, during the 1990s, AOL\u2019s stock appreciated 80,000%.\n\nOf course, it didn\u2019t always last. Some of the most interesting moments in \u201cHow the Internet Happened\u201d occur when we meet again the already-forgotten players of the early days. Remember the search engines Lycos and Excite, or vanished digital publications like Feed or Suck? Or what about those profitless but hypertrophied creatures of the dot-com boom, such as theglobe.com? In 1999 a company called Pixelon raised $35 million, Mr. McCullough notes, to develop video and audio streaming. But even if the idea had been technologically feasible in an era of limited bandwidth, the company\u2019s founders seemed more interested in partying than building out their technology. Pixelon spent $16 million of its startup kitty \u201con a company launch party at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas that featured performances by KISS, the Dixie Chicks, Sugar Ray, and a reunion concert by the Who.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s remarkable that after the smoke cleared we were left with something truly new. One of the lessons from Mr. McCullough\u2019s history is that some of the also-rans of the early years gave rise to the dominating businesses of today. To take just one example, GoTo.com (later Overture) was probably the first search engine to come up with a plausible bidding system for paying advertisers. Google already had a powerful search engine. But Mr. McCullough asserts that only by having \u201ccribbed\u201d from Overture\u2019s template for advertising\u2014and then improving on it\u2014did Larry Page and Sergey Brin\u2019s young company become immensely profitable.\n\nSuch historical tidbits help us see that today\u2019s tech titans didn\u2019t arrive on the scene as superhuman. People we now think of as oracular\u2014Bill Gates, for sure, but also Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg\u2014were propelled by good ideas and good timing. But they were mostly making things up as they went along. Many of these leaders could never have made it to exalted status, Mr. McCullough reminds us, without deputies doing a lot of the grunt work. At Amazon, there was Shel Kaphan, \u201cwho would go on to write much of the initial structure that would become the Amazon site.\u201d At eBay, Mary Lou Song was essential in \u201ccultivating the community\u201d that proved fundamental to the site\u2019s success.\n\nAll of which is to say that the history of the internet has already been refracted too much by myth. It was messy; it was ugly. Heroes often looked like fools, and vice versa. Mr. McCullough exits on the point that the beautiful things that ultimately epitomized the internet\u2019s evolution\u2014the iPod and iPhone\u2014probably didn\u2019t happen exactly as we remember either. Steve Jobs didn\u2019t want to open his online music store to Windows users\u2014the move that ultimately sparked Apple\u2019s rebirth\u2014until, exasperated, he told those advocating the change at Apple: \u201cGo do whatever the hell you want.\u201d\n\nHe was even reluctant to do the iPhone until he was persuaded by some of his top engineers. Eventually he gave the green light. And what resulted was the most profitable company in the history of the world, except for maybe the Dutch East India Co.\n\nDo you want to argue about the last point? We all have the internet now. So go ahead, Google it.\n\nMr. Gertner is the author of \u201cThe Idea Factory: Bell Labs and the Great Age of American Innovation.\u201d", "Walmart Inc. filed a lawsuit Thursday against its longtime credit-card issuer, Synchrony Financial, alleging the lender breached terms of its contract with the retail giant.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court of the Western District of Arkansas, alleges that some of Synchrony\u2019s underwriting standards financially harmed Walmart.

We would do hourlong comedy sets interacting with passengers on flights taking off in London. I was about to do my set on a flight to New York when the pilot told us the plane was having technical difficulties and had to go back to Heathrow. We managed to get rebooked on the last flight to New York. After we took off, I began my set. About a half-hour into it, a flight attendant proceeded to yell that I was a terrorist.

It\u2019s a truth borne out by the success of Kylie Jenner\u2019s Lip Kits, which the youngest of the Jenner-Kardashian clan launched in 2015. As of 2017, her company, Kylie Cosmetics, had sold more than $630 million worth of makeup. At 21, she\u2019s on her way to becoming the youngest self-made billionaire ever, thanks in part to a tube of glam goo.\n\nA lip kit sounds more important than it is, like a set of survival tools to keep you attractive during a global apocalypse. In fact, it\u2019s just a coordinating liquid lipstick and lip liner costing $27-30; new kits drop via Ms. Jenner\u2019s Instagram account with more frequency than albums by rapper Travis Scott, her boyfriend and father of the couple\u2019s daughter Stormi. At last count, Ms. Jenner had well over 117 million Instagram followers, and I admit I\u2019m one of them.\n\nThough fairly makeup-averse, I was curious about the lip kit. No one I knew had bought one, or any lipstick recently\u2014surprising, since sales of prestige lip products are robust, accounting for $682 million year to date, according to Larissa Jensen, a beauty industry analyst at NPD Group. Other similar lip sets by Pat McGrath and Tom Ford are gaining ground. When I asked my son\u2019s girlfriend what she thought all the hubbub was about, she said rather eloquently: \u201cLipstick holds the promise of transformation.\u201d\n\nALL THE KITS AND CABOODLES / The Kylie Cosmetics Lip Kit Flanked by Rival Products Photo: F.

I watched Ms. Jenner\u2019s soul-numbing, yet informative 10-minute video about her beauty routine to perfect my technique. In it, she runs through her whole morning makeup routine, allocating about 30 seconds to the Lip Kit. I learned I should delineate my lips with pencil color, then smooth on the lipstick and, to get her famous plush pout, color outside the lines. Liner, an oft-ignored step, adds a precise shape. The process did make my lips seem bigger, though I didn\u2019t go as Jessica-Rabbit-ish as Ms. Jenner does.\n\nThe next day I set off for my Manhattan gym sporting Autumn, a terra-cotta rose; to secure a good spot in my cardio class, I\u2019d rushed through my new lipstick ritual. A gym buddy asked me what I\u2019d done with my hair, and when I mentioned my lip kit, she stared at me with disappointment. I\u2019d become one of those pathetic people who wear makeup to the gym. Still, the instructor gave my arm a squeeze and said, \u201cGood work today!\u201d an accolade I chalked up to my new visage, alluring even when sweaty.\n\nI liked the attention, but it puzzled me the way human emotion confounds Data, the android on \u201cStar Trek: The Next Generation.\u201d In the mid-1970s, when I was Ms. Jenner\u2019s age, looking beautiful meant looking natural. I remember feeling sad for a mink-coat-clad woman at the Ralphs supermarket in Hollywood, a Norma Desmond pushing her grocery cart down the cereal aisle, her face pancaked and lips smeared a brilliant red. Makeup had no place in my feminist agenda.\n\nThat attitude is out of date, said Gloria-Jean Masciarotte, a feminist scholar in Providence, R.I. Her college students routinely wear full-face makeup, in part, she thinks, \u201cbecause in our heightened celebrity culture, everyone wants to be ready for his or her close-up.\u201d Lipstick occupies an exalted place in the zeitgeist. \u201cIt\u2019s a statement you wear, sometimes an aggressive one.\u201d I began rethinking my lip color: Perhaps the cherry red Boss Lip Kit would serve me well.\n\nLipstick as empowerment was a new mind-set for me, but as I walked around the city shellacked in Victoria, a dark crimson, the glances I attracted warmed me to the idea. I\u2019m building my own empire of followers, I thought smugly. Then realizing I was late for an appointment with my stockbroker about the haywire market, I forgot all about lipstick.\n\nFAMILY BUSINESS / How Kylie\u2019s Sibling and Half-Siblings Plugged Her Entrepreneurial Efforts Via Twitter\n\nThe success of Kylie Jenner\u2019s Lip Kits certainly speaks to her innate instincts as a businesswoman.

With her spouse frequently traveling, she was left at home with Tuck and Liza. \u201cPeople would say, \u2018You have two cats?\u2019 and I could just hear the pity in their voices,\u201d recalled Ms. Wills, a photographer.\n\nSpurred on by her critics\u2019 ignorance, she created Girls and Their Cats, a website and Instagram account dedicated to cool cats both human and feline.

A single bag or top is an advisable first step. If you opt to go full-body cat, consider a less literal iteration, such as Marni\u2019s cat-face print jacket or skirt, whose jade-colored fabric is a nearly abstract pattern of whiskers and yellow cat eyes. \u201cThe last thing you want to look like is one of those \u2018cat lady\u2019 Halloween costumes with hundreds of stuffed animals affixed to a bodysuit,\u201d said Jessica Matlin, beauty director of Harper\u2019s Bazaar and co-host of the beauty podcast Fat Mascara.\n\nEven if you don\u2019t live with a cat, break out the lint roller before you leave the house. \u201cWear the cat but don\u2019t be covered in actual cat,\u201d said fashion designer Ilana Kohn, who cohabits with three felines.\n\nRarely, it seems, have cats possessed such cachet. While in ancient times they symbolized femininity, sexuality and motherhood, with Christianity\u2019s rise, they came to be seen as agents of evil.

The ads on Stories grab attention because they take over the entire screen of the phone, offering marketers a large, interactive canvas for their photos and videos, ad buyers say.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nThe flip side is an ad format that is uncommon outside of Snapchat, which pioneered the Stories format.\n\nThe \u201cfirst thing to get push back on in production meetings\u201d is shooting ads vertically, to fit the way users hold their mobile phones, said Mark Sytsma, associate director of paid social at Huge, a digital ad agency.\n\nThere are other considerations particular to Stories ads, such as the need to create photos and videos that instantly attract users\u2019 attention and prevent them from tapping the screen to skip ahead. \u201cYou\u2019re at the mercy of a users\u2019 thumb clicking through the story very quickly,\u201d said Wesley MacLaggan, senior vice president of marketing at Marin Software , an ad-management platform.\n\nFacebook declined to comment for this article, pointing to executives\u2019 comments on the earnings call and elsewhere.\n\nThe more time users spend in interacting with Stories, the more opportunity there is for Facebook to serve ads. Yet advertiser demand for new formats can lag user engagement as they attempt to figure out how to drive the best results from them, which can initially lead to lower prices in the auction-based ad environment.\n\nThe cost of 1,000 user impressions on Facebook Stories, which only rolled out globally to all advertisers in September, is around $4, compared with $5 on the news feed, according to marketing technology company 4C Insights.\n\nThe experience of Instagram, where Stories arrived earlier, suggests that the price of Facebook Stories advertising will eventually catch up to feed ads. The CPM\u2014advertising parlance for the cost per thousand ad impressions\u2014for an Instagram ad in either Stories or the feed was roughly $4 over the past month, a 4C spokeswoman said.\n\nDepending on the specific audiences that brands are looking to target, the CPMs on Instagram Stories can run into the $20 range, said Huge\u2019s Mr. Sytsma.\n\nAnd Marin Software clients\u2019 spending on Instagram Stories grew to 25% of their Instagram outlay in the third quarter of this year from 8% a year earlier, Mr. MacLaggan said.\n\nThe percentage of Facebook spend directed toward Facebook Stories remains a \u201cfraction of a percent,\u201d he said.\n\nTo help close the gap between consumers and advertisers, Facebook is offering clients so-called Stories School education sessions to marketers and their agencies.\n\nFacebook\u2019s Ad Manager tool may also benefit Stories ads in the long run. It lets marketers easily buy inventory across its products, including the main app, Instagram and its Audience Network, which runs ads across outside apps and websites. Buyers can tick boxes to send their creative work across Facebook\u2019s entire portfolio, without having to buy each separately. As the Stories ad format continues to gain popularity on Instagram, the Ad Manager tool may encourage more buyers to purchase Stories ads on Facebook\u2019s other platforms.\n\nStill, the news feed isn\u2019t going away, with 1.5 billion users logging into Facebook every day.\n\nFor some clients, Stories ads are driving more engagement, such as swiping up to learn more about a product, than ads in the feed, according to Courtney Blount, group director at MDC Partners media planning and buying agency the Media Kitchen.

That was the only reasonable outcome of a game that pitted Texas Tech against Oklahoma, the most prolific offenses with the most productive quarterbacks in college football.\n\nWhat unfolded over four hours and 10 minutes on that fall night two years ago shattered even the wildest predictions. It only vaguely resembled the game of football as most people conceived it at the time. And it opened eyes to a startling revelation: The sport might be evolving faster than anybody could have imagined.\n\nThe numbers were historically ridiculous. The two teams combined for 124 passing attempts. Their 1,708 combined yards\u2014an identical 854 apiece\u2014are the most ever produced in the 149 years since college football first began. Mahomes alone produced 819 yards\u2014also a record that still stands.\n\nBaker Mayfield, front, and Patrick Mahomes during warmups prior to the 2016 game. Photo: John Weast/Getty Images\n\nOklahoma\u2019s 66-59 win on Oct. 22, 2016, has come to be regarded as the apotheosis of the Air Raid offense, which has ruled college football for the better part of a decade. But this game also highlighted the deep chasm between the free-wheeling, pass-happy college game and the hidebound professional one.\n\n\u201cIt was a basketball game on a football field,\u201d said Eric Morris, then the Texas Tech offensive coordinator. \u201cOne shot after another.\u201d\n\nTexas Tech and Oklahoma play again this weekend. So do Mahomes and Mayfield\u2014this time as NFL quarterbacks. And just two years later, the chasm between the pro and college game looks markedly smaller. NFL scoring is at an all-time high. Teams are passing more than ever. And NFL coaches are adopting Air Raid schemes and concepts that not long ago were as foreign as French cricket.\n\nMahomes is casually picking apart defenses and setting fire to NFL record books as the starting quarterback of the Kansas City Chiefs. Mayfield, once so undersized and unheralded he had to walk-on at two separate schools, was the No. 1 overall pick in this year\u2019s NFL draft and is the starting quarterback for the Cleveland Browns.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nHow this happened can be directly traced to that meeting in Lubbock, Texas. The playcalls and pass plays that engineered that record-breaking shootout weren\u2019t merely gimmicks, it turns out. That game was the exact moment when NFL coaches began to ask themselves a question that bordered on blasphemy: What if the most productive offense in football history didn\u2019t have to stay marooned in college football?\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never bought the notion, and I think it\u2019s a ridiculous notion, that what works at this level won\u2019t work at that level,\u201d said Mike Leach, the Washington State coach and Air Raid evangelist. \u201cIt\u2019s all relative.\u201d\n\nThe basic principles of the Air Raid are hardly revolutionary by NFL standards. The offense spreads the field to take advantage of its full dimensions and passes out of the shotgun with abnormal frequency, because pass plays are statistically more efficient than running plays.\n\nBut what the Air Raid ushered in was about a wholesale shift in how offensive football is conceived.\n\n\u201cAir Raid has always been more of an attitude than a playbook,\u201d said Hal Mumme, the coach who pioneered the offense.\n\nBaker Mayfield threw for 545 yards and seven touchdowns, completing 27 of 36 passes in Oklahoma\u2019s 66-59 win. Photo: John Weast/Getty Images\n\nThat attitude was antithetical in many ways to everything NFL traditionalists believed. For the better part of football history, NFL play callers had come to think of successful play as one that helped keep the chains moving and not to get stuck in second- or third-and-long situations. \u201cTypically,\u201d Cowboys coach Jason Garrett said in 2014, \u201cyou\u2019re in more manageable third-down situations when you run the ball.\u201d\n\nAir Raid disciples don\u2019t concern themselves with slamming the ball up the gut for a three-yard gain on first down; they throw the ball 25 yards downfield. And if it\u2019s incomplete, they\u2019re confident in their ability to throw deep and produce a chunk yardage play on second or third down instead.\n\nThis same philosophy has begun to infiltrate the NFL. Pass plays now account for more than 50% of first-down calls. More than ever, NFL teams are realizing that first and second down are opportunities for the offense to try to reach the end zone rather than trying to stay \u201con script\u201d and reach third-and-short.\n\nNFL teams are suddenly averaging more yards per play than ever before\u2014and first downs per game are at an all-time high. When the Rams shredded the Vikings for 38 points earlier this season, Los Angeles faced six third downs during the game. They converted only one. But Jared Goff, the Rams\u2019 quarterback and a graduate of the Air Raid scheme in college, completed 18 passes of at least 10 yards\u2014mostly on first- and second-down. The Rams punted only twice the entire game.\n\nNFL decision makers used to lament that quarterbacks like Goff primarily played out the shotgun in college. But in recent years coaches have come to embrace Air Raid passers and have shaped their offenses to look more like them. This season, 64% of NFL snaps have come out of the shotgun. That\u2019s nearly twice as often as the 32.8% in 2008, according to Stats LLC.\n\n\u201cThe NFL is finally starting to cater to these guys a little bit more and not be so hard headed,\u201d Morris, now the head coach at Incarnate Word, said.\n\nThose strategies have begun to make the NFL look like Oklahoma-Texas Tech on Sundays.\n\nTexas Tech\u2019s Patrick Mahomes completed 52-of-88 passes for 734 yards and five touchdowns in the 2016 game against Oklahoma. He also ran for 85 yards and two scores. Photo: John Weast/Getty Images\n\nBoth quarterbacks in that game put up absurd numbers. Mahomes completed 52-of-88 passes for 734 yards and five touchdowns. He ran for another 85 yards and two scores. Mayfield threw for 545 yards and seven touchdowns, completing 27 of 36 passes. And he had a firm belief that his offense could score on every possession.\n\n\u201cThat is kind of the belief and confidence I have had in the offenses that I have played in,\u201d Mayfield said this week. \u201cThat is the kind of thing that I want to install here.\u201d\n\nSince that game, Goff, who struggled as a rookie, has emerged as a star in Los Angeles with a coach, Sean McVay, who has embraced the Air Raid concepts that made Goff so effective in college. The Chiefs traded up in the 2017 draft to take Mahomes with the 10th pick, and he has been the NFL\u2019s best quarterback this season. Mayfield has shown flashes of brilliance since he was drafted as the No. 1 pick, leading the Browns to their first win since 2016.\n\nAnd the college coaches who have popularized these schemes are no longer pariahs accused of creating a quarterback crisis. They\u2019re responsible for a quarterback boom, and the NFL knows it.\n\nLincoln Riley, Mayfield\u2019s offensive coordinator and then head coach at Oklahoma, is now one of the hottest coaching candidates in the league\u2014and the oddsmakers favorite to fill the NFL\u2019s newest coaching vacancy: head coach of Mayfield and the Browns.\n\nWrite to Andrew Beaton at andrew.beaton@wsj.com and Jonathan Clegg at jonathan.clegg@wsj.com", "To subscribe to the newsletter, please sign up here MUST READS Northern Ireland\u2019s Stormy Past Haunts U.K. Efforts to Leave EU: Charlie Butler\u2019s misgivings with a proposal to let the European Union retain influence over Northern Ireland after Britain leaves the bloc helps explain why this British region is proving the biggest stumbling block to a Brexit deal.

The costume designer who earlier this year brought the tribes of Wakanda to varicolored life in Black Panther has returned to a decade she knows well. But this isn\u2019t the 1970s of her own adolescence, nor is it the glamorous domestic horror show of Tina and Ike Turner in What\u2019s Love Got to Do With It or the outer-borough disco era, threatened by the creep of punk, depicted in Summer of Sam.

Moore\u2019s personal style was exuberantly louche: hats that matched his shoes, swaths of fur and snakeskin, star-shaped shades. \u201cReally pimp-style,\u201d she adds. \u201cBut I tell my team, we\u2019re not going to be dependent on what we have in our minds about the \u201970s. I pride myself on accuracy. We need to know the difference between how people dressed in a juke joint or on the chitlin circuit or in small clubs, the difference between Indiana and the South and California. So when they go to the George Foreman fight and everybody\u2019s all dressed up, I\u2019m not trying to make it silly. Another designer might want you to laugh. Maybe stop at the big Afro, platform shoes, crazy wild patterns, polyester. Instead, I\u2019m taking it very seriously and saying, This is fabulous. We were coming out of the 1960s, civil rights, and showing a sense of pride in ourselves. When I dress these guys, I\u2019m focusing on that.\u201d\n\nCarter remembers the Afro that one of her brothers had as a teenager, how he would slowly drag his comb from the back of his neck, raking the hair forward and creating a sort of thrust, like the prow of a ship. \u201cNot everyone was perfectly round with their \u2019fro,\u201d she says. \u201cLet\u2019s not generalize.\u201d\n\nWe are sitting in the living room of Carter\u2019s Spanish Revival house in L.A.\u2019s Miracle Mile. Although she has always tried to insulate her domestic life from her on-screen worlds, Black Panther has broken the seal: Elongated wooden ritual masks from the Dogon people of Mali hang on the walls, and calfskin harnesses from the Hamar tribe of Ethiopia serve as a runner for the dining room table. \u201cThere was just too much beauty,\u201d says Carter, who is best known for her painstaking historical facsimiles on films such as Steven Spielberg\u2019s Amistad and Spike Lee\u2019s Malcolm X. She was nominated for Oscars for both projects, the first African-American recognized in the category. Though she has dabbled in spoofs and sci-fi and rom-coms (even the pilot for Seinfeld), Carter is, above all, a historicist. \u201cMy wheelhouse is the African-American journey in this country, from Selma\u201d\u2014Ava DuVernay\u2019s 2014 film about the voting rights marches led by Martin Luther King Jr.\u2014\u201cto Do the Right Thing. Stories rooted in the politics of the time. Sometimes I\u2019m looking to be inspired. Sometimes I\u2019m looking to have fun.\u201d She laughs sheepishly, her dense, golden curls washing over her eyes. \u201cSometimes I\u2019m looking at the mortgage.\u201d\n\nThe actress Carmen Ejogo, for whom Carter designed costumes in both Sparkle and Selma, believes that Carter, 58, is a classic example of a gifted African-American artist whose mainstream success came late. \u201cLike so many blacks in Hollywood, you can be at the top of your game for decades before the industry notices or recognizes you,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s a problem across departments, from the hairstylist to the actor to the sound mixer, where it\u2019s assumed that what you can do is \u2018black art.\u2019 What should be obvious is that Ruth is a master of her craft, period.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Ethan James Green for WSJ.

Photo: Ethan James Green for WSJ. Magazine, Styling by Patti Wilson\n\nIn Carter\u2019s 30-year career\u2014which has been marked by quantum leaps, from theater to film, from niche indies to epic studio pictures\u2014Black Panther, Ryan Coogler\u2019s superhero blockbuster, represents a level of exposure that even a sprawling Spielberg period drama couldn\u2019t provide. It also posed an unaccustomed set of challenges. Wakanda is a fictional African nation free from the blight of colonialism, a furtive technological powerhouse fueled by a precious metal called vibranium. Depending on your point of view, it is either an imagined utopia or a mash-up of African clich\u00e9s\u2014lip plates and neck coils and muddy dreadlocks. \u201cIt\u2019s a fine line,\u201d Carter says. \u201cAfrica is modern. Everybody\u2019s moved to the city. You\u2019re not going to see the indigenous tribes the way people would like to think they could. You might go to some far-out place and see a Himba girl walking her calf on a dirt road, but she\u2019s on her cellphone, and if you want to take her picture she\u2019s going to charge you $10. I had to constantly be aware of things that might feel like stereotypes and not depend on what was in my brain. This movie is a fantasy, but if you don\u2019t do the research, you can get into trouble.\u201d\n\nAlthough there may be no bigger prize at the moment than a job on a Marvel movie, not every costume designer is interested. Marvel exerts unyielding control over its image making. The studio\u2019s visual development department enters the process with designs of its own, ready to be adapted into action figures and backpacks and lunchboxes. At Marvel, the movie\u2019s script\u2014always Carter\u2019s jumping-off point\u2014is withheld lest secrets get leaked. \u201cWhen I was told that they were going to come into the offices where we were creating costumes and put cameras around, it just blew my mind,\u201d Carter recalls. \u201cEven the guys delivering our lunches had to sign NDAs.\u201d\n\nThe Black Panther character was introduced in Marvel comic books in 1966, and the film\u2019s visual style originates there. The Dora Milaje, for example\u2014Wakanda\u2019s elite, all-female special forces\u2014were drawn with hormonal male readers in mind, as sexy bald women whose breasts were barely contained by red bustiers. Marvel\u2019s sketches for the film were less puerile but wholly impressionistic, and so Carter began her customary deep dive. She pored over beadwork, leather, fabric and armor from across Africa and stationed shoppers throughout the continent. She took her team to the Metropolitan Museum in New York to view a Dinka corset. She scoured the Pasadena Rose Bowl flea market and emerged with Dogon scarves. \u201cIt\u2019s wherever you can find it,\u201d she explains. \u201cAnd then you\u2019re like, How do I translate this into a Wakandan story? We see how the people of Lesotho look in their indigenous way, some still donning the heart-shaped hats and those beautiful colorful blankets. So what does it look like when their blankets are lined in vibranium?\u201d\n\nCarter created beaded tabards hung with trinkets and hand-tooled leather skirts; she borrowed the traditional neck rings of South Africa\u2019s Ndebele women; she designed giant panther-face buckles and plated the armor so it gleamed like jewelry and applied a raised-ink technique to tights to give them the illusion of scarification. \u201cThese costumes couldn\u2019t just look like Hollywood toys,\u201d she says. \u201cThey had to have culture. They had to speak directly to Africa, and they had to have a sense of history, like a samurai costume. Train your daughter to be a Dora, and hand your uniform down to her.\u201d\n\nAngela Bassett, who plays Wakanda\u2019s Queen Mother, has worked with Carter on five projects over the years. \u201cIt\u2019s the exhaustive research that sets her apart,\u201d Bassett says. \u201cShe loves the character as much as you do, and she wants you to enter the character with her. It\u2019s a true collaboration. You walk into the dressing room, she has these beautiful sketches, you begin to relax. You conspire together.\u201d\n\nREEL WORLDS For three decades, Carter has worked on Hollywood feature films, including (from top left): Summer of Sam (1999), Lee Daniels\u2019 The Butler (2013), Black Panther (2018) and Selma (2014). \u201cIt\u2019s the exhaustive research that sets her apart,\u201d says actor Angela Bassett.

In Black Panther, the costumes meld a cumulative African past to a fantasy African future, in the process pressing against the confines of an established superhero idiom. The term Afrofuturism has been applied to the film. Coined in 1993 by the cultural critic Mark Dery, it typically describes an aesthetic in which sci-fi interacts with the cultural contributions of the African diaspora (think Janelle Mon\u00e1e). Both high-tech and essentially African, Carter\u2019s costumes seem to be an exemplar of Afrofuturism, although she wishes people were using the word more expansively.\n\n\u201cI think people don\u2019t really understand what it is,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity to bring culture to the table and show it in a fantastical, fantasy way. But it\u2019s also about what we can do now that will benefit society later. How are we foreseeing ourselves in the future? When Spike Lee asked me to put Larry Fishburne in a Soweto T-shirt in School Daze, he was realizing his Afrofuture. When Ava DuVernay decided that she didn\u2019t want to be a publicist and she wanted to direct, she was realizing her Afrofuture.\u201d\n\nCarter grew up in Springfield, Massachusetts, the youngest of eight children of a single mother. Her older brothers were her idols, and because they painted and drew, she did the same\u2014the family\u2019s dining table was always arrayed in pigments and sketch pads. In her bedroom, an old black Singer sewing machine console served as her desk. When she was 10 years old, Carter taught herself how to sew using the single Singer pattern that was housed inside. She took her mother\u2019s old dresses and remade them. She fashioned a denim blazer out of old, cut-up jeans. In college, at the Hampton Institute (now Hampton University) in Virginia, Carter\u2019s skill at the sewing machine caught the attention of the theater department. She was asked to make costumes for a production of Moli\u00e8re\u2019s The Would-Be Gentleman. Soon an empty costume shop with a few racks of clothes and a cutting table became her campus home; Carter designed costumes for every play that followed.\n\nFrom left: Malcolm X (1992), What\u2019s Love Got to Do With It (1993), Amistad (1997) Photo: Courtesy of Everett Collection (2); AF archive/Alamy Stock Photo\n\nAfter graduating with no formal training in costume design, she found herself a succession of internships, first at a theater back in Springfield, and then at the Santa Fe Opera, where she worked as a stitcher at a table of six. \u201cThere was a head cutter and her assistant,\u201d she recalls. \u201cWe\u2019d see the designers come in, and I could see that they were talking over their illustrations: The English Cat, The Tempest. We were making doublets and bucket boots. I have thousands of little holes in my fingers from the hand-sewing. But I learned the craft.\u201d At the end of the summer, she drove her Volkswagen Rabbit to L.A. and landed a job at the Los Angeles Theatre Center, where she worked as a dresser, assisting the actors with fast changes backstage. Eventually she talked her way into the costume shop, where she met designers who had worked in Hollywood; they taught her about aging, dyeing and other effects deployed on-screen.\n\nCarter joined a traveling dance troupe as its costume designer, and in 1986 the company mounted a hugely popular show performed to Stevie Wonder\u2019s Songs in the Key of Life. One evening during intermission, a friend introduced her to Spike Lee, who had just made his first feature, She\u2019s Gotta Have It. Lee invited her to a screening. \u201cI thought, Wow. Here is this simple story of a girl walking through Brooklyn and her relationships,\u201d Carter recalls. \u201cAnd I\u2019m like, I can do that. I\u2019m sure I can do that. I\u2019ve been doing Shakespeare. I can definitely do that.\u201d A few months later, Lee\u2019s film made a splash at Cannes, and he called Carter to ask if she\u2019d do the costumes for his second feature, School Daze. He sent her the script, and she went right to work. The story was set at a historically black college, and she had been to one herself; she had a keen sense of the various cliques and their styles. Lee invited her to New York for a meeting, so Carter quit her job and flew across the country, lugging a giant portfolio of drawings. They discussed her work and went to a screening of Native Son, and Carter slept in Lee\u2019s little extra bedroom. It was her big break. All told, Carter has designed costumes for 10 of Lee\u2019s films.\n\nThough she has dabbled in spoofs and sci-fi and rom-coms, Ruth E. Carter Carter is, above all, a historicist. Film by MediaStorm\n\nTo achieve what she calls \u201crigorous historical reality,\u201d Carter brings a forensic intensity to her research. For Lee\u2019s Malcolm X, she visited the department of corrections in Boston to read the incarcerated black activist\u2019s letters and sift through stacks of police records. \u201cI needed to understand the man,\u201d she says, \u201cand you can\u2019t necessarily do that through photos. How much did he care about his appearance? What was his relationship to things?\u201d While working on Selma, she noticed from photographs and old film reels that Martin Luther King\u2019s neck bulged out over his starched, white collars. \u201cI wanted collars just tight enough that the flesh on David Oyelowo\u2019s neck would roll over. A lot of times we get clothes onto a person and we think our job is done. But I like to see the sweat on the clothes. I like to see how people wear them and embody them. It\u2019s Hollywood, but if we make a Hollywood version of a person, it doesn\u2019t feel real.\u201d\n\nFor the 2016 remake of Roots, Carter worked her way, with gloved hands, through an archive of early-19th-century garments in Williamsburg, Virginia, and read extensively about the domestic lives of slaves. A plantation owner might buy a run of cloth, all the same stripe or gingham, which could be adapted into pants, skirts and kerchiefs; a single set of clothing needed to last a whole year. \u201cWash and repair\u2014that\u2019s what they did,\u201d she says. \u201cThat gave me a sense of how the clothes looked: clean but mended. There was no kindness in the type of cloth used. So I\u2019d get some homespun gingham and use it for a whole plantation, mixing it with a rough sackcloth. We have a process for roughing things up, and through that process the clothes gain a kind of history.\u201d\n\nCarter has worked with the director John Singleton on four films, including 2000\u2019s Shaft. \u201cBy God, she made Sam Jackson sexy,\u201d he remembers. \u201cShe shaved his head, gave him a goatee and an Armani coat, and he took that look and made 25 more movies with it. I say this rarely about people I collaborate with: If you\u2019re lucky enough to have Ruth on your team, you just give her the ball and let her run with it.\u201d\n\nLoewe coat, $4,890, loewe\u200b\u200b.com, Wing & Weft gloves, $275, wingweftgloves\u200b.com, Gucci ring, $470, gucci\u200b.com.

The film stars Eddie Murphy as the comic Moore, and Carter has nearly 80 changes to prepare for him. (Costume designers think in terms of changes.) In late summer the first retrospective of Carter\u2019s work, beginning with Do the Right Thing, opened at the Heinz History Center in Pittsburgh; Marvel lent nine costumes from Black Panther. And this fall she is busy with a 25-university lecture tour called \u201cConcepts to Creation,\u201d in which she takes college students through the process of designing the Black Panther wardrobe. Meanwhile, she\u2019s never had more offers, and a sequel to Black Panther may not be far behind.\n\n\u201cHonestly, I\u2019d love to do something like Moulin Rouge!, where the worlds of theater and cinema can live in the same place,\u201d Carter says. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not done with the South. When I look at portraits from the antebellum South, I find that I want to re-create some of those images. I\u2019m ready to be inspired by another story about black culture. It\u2019s not just clothes.

Business schools have been particularly aggressive in recruiting abroad as they face steadily declining interest from Americans, who are less willing to pay upward of $100,000 for an M.B.A. in a strong job market.\n\nSchools say the OPT program benefits foreign students eager to launch their careers in the U.S., where they typically earn more than in other countries, which can help recent graduates pay down their hefty tuition bills for graduate degrees.\n\nThe program is widely viewed as a steppingstone to coveted H-1B visas, which the government caps at 85,000 for private employers each year. Through OPT, graduates in science, technology, engineering and mathematics can extend their stays by an additional 24 months, further bolstering its appeal to students and employers.\n\nNew York University hosted 6,199 OPT students last year, more than any other school tracked over the 2017 calendar year, although the data don\u2019t break out how many were enrolled at its Stern School of Business. A spokesman said the university monitors student migration by the academic year, and it enrolled 3,929 OPT students last fall.\n\nOther top schools for international students seeking U.S. work experience include University of Southern California in Los Angeles and Northeastern University in Boston along with a handful of smaller public institutions in the South and Midwest. USC and Northeastern say their diverse classroom experience creates a more robust academic experience.\n\nAt University of Rochester, N.Y., the Simon School of Business in August won STEM-designation for its flagship two-year M.B.A. program, on top of a handful of other masters degrees it offers at the business school. The school tweaked its core degree requirements to include classes in topics like marketing analytics and machine learning, Dean Andrew Ainslie said.\n\nUntil this year, many business schools had boosted overall enrollment with quant-heavy business and finance degrees that meet government standards for STEM student-workers. But students outside the U.S. submitted 11% fewer applications to American business schools in 2018. Across higher education programs, the number of new student visas being issued has slouched, which university leaders and students attribute to fears of a tougher policy on work-authorization programs like OPT.\n\nImmigration officials earlier this year revised the eligibility requirements for the kinds of jobs student-workers could legally perform, and in August moved to limit how much time students can remain in the country when they aren\u2019t actively taking classes. Ms. Canty declined to comment on the new policy guidance, citing a lawsuit filed by several schools this fall to prevent them from taking effect. \u201cAny changes to our student-visa process would have to go through the federal rule-making process,\u201d she said.\n\nCompanies say they are feeling the effects of the heightened scrutiny. A July report from the nonpartisan National Foundation for American Policy found immigration authorities tripled the number of requests for further evidence justifying employers\u2019 petitions for H-1B hires between the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2017.\n\nAmazon and Google representatives declined to comment. Semiconductor giant Intel Corp. hires 1,400 to 1,700 foreign graduates from U.S. masters and doctoral programs every year, according to spokeswoman Stephanie Matthew, virtually all of whom are authorized to work under the OPT program. The company also hired around 500 interns through a related student-training program.\n\n\u201cAlthough we seek U.S. workers first when we need to fill U.S. positions, we also hire and sponsor foreign nationals for those positions in which we experience a shortage of qualified U.S. workers,\u201d Ms. Matthew said.\n\nMicrosoft Corp. , another top employer of OPT grads, recently started holding virtual meetings each month to respond to questions from staff about ongoing changes to the student-visa rules and other immigration programs that have been modified, a spokesman said.\n\nRepresentatives from the other top employers declined to comment on their foreign student recruiting practices.\n\nWrite to Kelsey Gee at kelsey.gee@wsj.com", "A brutal October selloff across stocks and bonds has tested investors\u2019 resolve and the durability of the more than nine-year-old bull market.\n\nEven after the S&P 500 rallied nearly 3% over the final two days of the month, the index in October still notched its most violent pullback in more than seven years. Stocks around the world lost about $5 trillion in value, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices, as shares in Europe and Asia also tumbled.\n\n..."]
