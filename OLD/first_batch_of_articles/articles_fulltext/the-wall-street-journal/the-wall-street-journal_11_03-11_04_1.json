["KLEINBASEL IS A LITTLE wedge of Basel, Switzerland, stranded in Germany, just across the Rhine from the city proper. Today the district is a hub for both commerce and culture\u2014most famously as the home of Art Basel, the annual fair that turns the city into the capital of the global art world every June. But in the 1950s, Kleinbasel was a sleepy place, a working- and middle-class redoubt bounded to the north by woods and vineyards and to the south by the river, warm enough in summer to swim in despite the rushing current.\n\nThis is where Pierre de Meuron met Jacques Herzog. \u201cWe grew up 200 yards from each other,\u201d recalls de Meuron, now 68. The pair first became acquainted when they were preschool age. Though they were from differing backgrounds\u2014de Meuron\u2019s family was Francophone, Herzog\u2019s German-speaking\u2014such distinctions meant little in polyglot Basel. And what they had in common was more compelling. \u201cOur interest was always in doing something with our hands, understanding how things worked,\u201d says de Meuron. They harbored a special enthusiasm, he adds, for \u201croller coasters and ships.\u201d\n\nPAIR OF ACES Jacques Herzog, one of the two founding partners of Herzog & de Meuron, viewing a design for the Berggruen Institute headquarters, to be built in Los Angeles. Photo: Juergen Teller for WSJ. Magazine\n\nThe two men haven\u2019t gotten terribly far from the playrooms and schoolyards of their youth. Today their studio is a scant five-minute walk from the old neighborhood, and they spend much of their time at the office tinkering with models and dreaming up gee-whiz notions. But the pair now have a firm of 390 employees playing alongside them, with another 62 scattered across five satellite branches around the world. And they\u2019re no longer dealing in idle fancies but creating some of the most challenging and startling architecture to be found anywhere.\n\nNow celebrating its 40th-anniversary year, the firm of Herzog & de Meuron (H&dM) enjoys a reach extending from Kleinbasel, where it designed the 2013 Messe building, in which Art Basel is now held, to Hong Kong, where its upcoming M+ museum will be a cultural landmark in a city better known for high-rises. After six decades of mind-melding friendship, the founders have succeeded in forging a shared sensibility and then diffusing it through their immense body of work, without ever seeming to dilute the formula. \u201cWe have never stopped being involved in every project, starting each project,\u201d says Herzog, also 68. It\u2019s a level of commitment that helps give the firm\u2019s projects their ineffable presence.\n\nCo-founder Pierre de Meuron. Photo: Juergen Teller for WSJ. Magazine\n\nOther than that, it can be difficult at times to say what does tie together the firm\u2019s diverse portfolio. Lower Manhattan\u2019s looming 56 Leonard apartment building, familiar to locals as the \u201cJenga\u201d tower; the sublime void of the turbine hall at London\u2019s Tate Modern; San Francisco\u2019s de Young Museum, resembling a rusty dinosaur grazing in Golden Gate Park: H&dM has been all over the map in every sense, taking a different formal tack with every banner commission. Fashion designer and arts patron Miuccia Prada, who has collaborated with the architects many times, says she is \u201calways attracted by the beauty of their work\u201d\u2014though the sheer range of projects they\u2019ve done together, from an eye-popping retail location in Tokyo to an austere runway design for last spring\u2019s 2019 cruise show in New York, demonstrates just how flexible H&dM\u2019s sense of beauty can be. As difficult as it is to fix an aesthetic label to the firm, its conceptual MO is even harder to describe, and talking to the founders doesn\u2019t necessarily clarify anything. \u201cYou can ask me how I see it,\u201d de Meuron hedges. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean I know exactly what it is.\u201d His colleague is even less forthcoming. \u201cI don\u2019t want to do any self-interpretation,\u201d says Herzog.\n\nForty Years of Herzog and de Meuron Its ideas and approaches are still fresh with each new project A Prada store in Tokyo. \u00a9 Nacasa & Partners Inc. 1 of 14 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 1 of 14 Show Caption A Prada store in Tokyo. \u00a9 Nacasa & Partners Inc.\n\nFor critics and fans who have followed the designers\u2019 ascent\u2014starting with their first projects around Basel that earned them a cult following, through their 2001 Pritzker Prize win, to the enthusiastic reception of their glittering Elbphilharmonie concert hall complex, which opened in Hamburg, Germany, last year\u2014the relative taciturnity of the partners can be convenient, allowing for various explanations to be projected onto them. For curator and architect Terence Riley, who commissioned the firm to design the P\u00e9rez Art Museum Miami when he was its director, the key is culture: \u201cJacques and Pierre have this very Swiss thing,\u201d he says, pointing to their sense of \u201corderliness\u201d combined with their \u201camazingly innovative ideas.\u201d\n\nFor photographer and collaborator Thomas Ruff, who helped create murals for H&dM\u2019s 1999 library at Germany\u2019s Eberswalde University for Sustainable Development, it\u2019s all about the partners\u2019 artistic predilections. In working with them, Ruff says, he has found that they \u201creally feel like artists themselves, and that\u2019s why they have this outlook and this great interest in contemporary art as well as architecture.\u201d Others might point to the importance of collaboration or materials or history or any one of a dozen-odd elements and attributes that mark H&dM\u2019s unique practice. Theories abound, and the designers seem to revel in the confusion.\n\nA Herzog & de Meuron\u2013designed lamp in the office reception area. Photo: Juergen Teller for WSJ. Magazine\n\nWhat really defines the practice is a combination of all these things\u2014including, and perhaps especially, the obfuscation. The playwright Tom Stoppard once said that a good piece of theater should be \u201ca series of ambushes,\u201d emotional and intellectual sneak attacks launched against the audience. Herzog & de Meuron buildings often seem to deploy a similar stratagem. Does the firm\u2019s Dominus Valley winery in Yountville, California, look like a flat black block? Go inside and you\u2019ll see the skin is made of wire cages filled with stones, the light peeking through them to cast a mottled pattern on the floor. Are the piers in the 1111 Lincoln Road complex in Miami Beach just solid slabs of concrete? Look closer: They\u2019re as softly textured as old wood, and they gleam like alabaster at sunset. More than simply subverting expectations, the architects practice a kind of radical defamiliarization, using every tool at their disposal to create environments so perfectly off-kilter that they achieve an entirely new kind of balance.\n\nThe garden at the firm\u2019s studio. Photo: Juergen Teller for WSJ. Magazine\n\nA FEW DAYS BEFORE ART BASEL gets underway, in advance of a busy week of meetings and openings, Herzog takes a moment to reflect. The firm\u2019s offices range over a collection of conjoined buildings, including lofted model warehouses and book-lined meeting rooms; but the weather is warm, the swimmers back in the Rhine, so Herzog is out in one of the open-air courtyards. \u201cI\u2019m someone who leaps into things,\u201d he says, and it\u2019s easy to believe him: Wiry and lean, the architect balances spryly on a porcelain stool.\n\n\u201cPierre reveals possibilities to anchor a concept, and then I\u2019m more the person who makes these changes, these jumps,\u201d Herzog continues. The dynamic between the partners has always been an essential feature of their practice, and their differences have only compounded their mystique. Where de Meuron is subdued, contemplative, almost impassive, Herzog is frank and energetic. That two so very distinct personalities have managed to forge an effective partnership is a testament to their years of professional coevolution. Well before the present glut of studios with acronymic titles, H&dM garnered international attention in the 1990s as a relative rarity in a profession then dominated by big-name lone wolves. The firm\u2019s earlier projects, like the 1994 signal box for the Swiss railway, an inscrutable parallelogram of ribbed copper, stood in stark contrast to the work of many contemporaries whose \u201cpersonal interest,\u201d as Herzog sees it, was in \u201crevealing the individual through the gestural stroke.\u201d\n\n\u201c Our collaboration is a complete involvement, a love affair. it is an act of passion and trust. \u201d \u2014Ai Weiwei\n\nTrying to recall his earliest thoughts about architecture, de Meuron claims not to have had any. \u201cI had no idea what it was,\u201d he says, and his partner concurs. When the two young men were finishing high school, although both were art enthusiasts steeped in Picasso and Manet, de Meuron thought he would go on to pursue engineering, while Herzog was considering biology and chemistry. Wanting something more, something that combined the humanities and the sciences, the two friends talked through their options, landing on design almost by default. They both enrolled in Zurich\u2019s polytechnic institute. \u201cImmediately I was sucked in,\u201d says de Meuron, \u201cbecause [design] touches so many different domains, so many different disciplines.\u201d The same process of dialogue that led them to their shared m\u00e9tier remains at the center of their approach, always undertaken in the same intrepid spirit.\n\nTo understand how Herzog and de Meuron progressed from that initial decision, it helps to visit the enormous archive the firm opened in 2014 in its mixed-use building in Basel\u2019s Dreispitz neighborhood. The structure, a sort of neo-brutalist pagoda on one side of a reinvented cultural district (its master plan was also created by the architects), houses a satellite office, fabrication facility and five stories of curios and castoffs dating back to the late 1970s. Among its treasures is one of the first H&dM projects to win public notice, Lego House, a 1985 work composed partly of the famed plastic bricks. Just a couple of feet high, it\u2019s little more than a miniature of a suburban home with a conventional gabled roof\u2014\u201ca form that even children draw,\u201d as Herzog notes. But this was no dollhouse. Originally exhibited at Paris\u2019s Centre Pompidou, it was stuffed with tiny versions of everyday objects and appeared alongside video stills of the interior, turning it into a meditation on memory and the idea of home.\n\nTesting building materials\u2019 ability to withstand the elements. Photo: Juergen Teller for WSJ. Magazine\n\nThe penchant for evocative artistry has been a staple of the architects\u2019 catalog ever since\u2014as has the gable, the closest thing H&dM has to a signature trope. Elsewhere in the Dreispitz archive are the original concept models for VitraHaus, a flagship for the eponymous furniture maker on its nearby campus. \u201cWe wanted a building that would show to the public that we were very serious about this issue of the home,\u201d says Vitra\u2019s chairman emeritus and board member Rolf Fehlbaum, who made the headquarters site an architectural wonderland, featuring celebrated buildings by Zaha Hadid and others. Herzog & de Meuron\u2019s contribution, opened in 2009, is a series of oblong houses stacked atop one another, their plain, dark facades capped at both ends by enormous windows; inside is a light-filled aerie with curving staircases and warm organic finishes. Fehlbaum was so pleased with the results that he turned to H&dM again for Vitra\u2019s Schaudepot, a brick open-storage facility, completed seven years later, that also features the telltale roofline. \u201cThere\u2019s something anonymous about it,\u201d Fehlbaum says of the motif, \u201csomething that allows a number of associations.\u201d\n\nAfter 40 years, the Swiss firm's ideas and approaches are still fresh with each new project. Film by MediaStorm\n\nWhatever the formal or cultural source material, the true hallmark of Herzog and de Meuron\u2019s work is their artistic ambition. The scale of that ambition can be measured in the caliber of the artists with whom they regularly collaborate, including Rosemarie Trockel, Michael Craig-Martin and, perhaps most prominently, Ai Weiwei. \u201cOur common ground,\u201d says Ai, \u201cis that we see architecture as an ethical practice\u2026in between the highest aesthetic judgment and the most practical problem solving.\u201d The architects and the artist discovered their shared affinities in 2002; Ai had long been interested in design, and together they won a competition to produce one of H&dM\u2019s highest-profile structures to date: the celebrated Bird\u2019s Nest stadium, a gleaming coil of steel ribbons built in Beijing for the 2008 Olympics. The Sino-Swiss team reunited last year to create Hansel & Gretel, an immersive installation at Manhattan\u2019s Park Avenue Armory that confronted visitors with projected images of their own movements as tracked by overhead drones. A sharp-eyed critique of the 21st-century surveillance state, it was a project very close to the artist\u2019s heart, and he found the architects well attuned to his ideas, capable of creating an environment that could spark a sense of information overload and anxiety, topics that have long been among Ai\u2019s chief preoccupations. \u201cOur collaboration is a complete involvement, a love affair,\u201d says Ai. \u201cIt is an act of passion and trust.\u201d\n\nSMALL WONDER Another model of the Berggruen Institute.\n\nONE DAY IN EARLY JUNE, Pierre de Meuron is in Kleinbasel to attend the groundbreaking of one of the firm\u2019s newest undertakings, the second tower for pharmaceutical giant Roche. Nearly identical to its predecessor, the high-rise will make a double icon out of what is already the most recognizable figure on the Basel skyline. In suit and tie, de Meuron blends almost seamlessly with his corporate clients, and as he picks up the ceremonial spade he seems somewhat embarrassed to be the center of attention.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019d [told] me when I was 5 or 10 that I would do most of the buildings on that site,\u201d says de Meuron, laughing. Still evidently bewildered by his own success, the architect is hardly less determined to capitalize on it than his energetic partner. A couple of weeks later, de Meuron is in New York preparing for a prospective client meeting in the lobby of the Public hotel. Opened only last year, the Lower East Side hot spot has already become a local standby, and the upstairs lounges are crowded with creatives in various attitudes of hip\u2014an unlikely setting for a sexagenarian Swiss in business attire. But then H&dM\u2019s sense of chic has always involved an element of the improbable. Ian Schrager, the hospitality magnate behind the Public, has sought out the firm for that very reason, beginning with their first collaboration, the nearby 40 Bond condominium completed in 2007, and continuing through to the brand-new 160 Leroy residential mid-rise. All of their projects together, Schrager notes, have been risky bets on high design in unlikely urban locales, which suits the developer\u2019s style. \u201cI like to pull a rabbit out of my hat,\u201d says Schrager. \u201cIf there\u2019s something that I really want to build, I build it with them.\u201d It doesn\u2019t hurt, the developer adds, that \u201cthey\u2019re very sensitive and intelligent about the budget.\u201d\n\nThe Tate Modern Switch House, an addition to the London museum. Photo: \u00a9 Hufton + Crow\n\nThis aptitude for combining the avant-garde with the pragmatic helped the firm score the commission for the new Upper East Side home of Dasha Zhukova, the international collector and the founder of Moscow\u2019s Garage Museum of Contemporary Art. The particulars of the design remain very much under wraps, but Zhukova confirms that the facade will feature a pattern of inverted brickwork, a subtle nod to the surrounding buildings that still preserves \u201ca flicker of innovation.\u201d \u201cOne of the special things about them as architects is that they\u2019re always thinking about the economic, political, even the spiritual landscape, as well as the practical,\u201d Zhukova says. \u201cThey think about civilization as much as functionalism.\u201d On a sensitive residential project like this one, the client\u2019s baseline prerequisites come first, but H&dM\u2019s subversive streak is bound to assert itself.\n\nPart of being subversive means being secretive, a quality rare among architects and one at which the Basel duo excel. Back at firm headquarters, whole studios are closed-door affairs, with clandestine projects in the works. The compound teems with young employees from around the world, an atmosphere \u201clike a college campus,\u201d as Schrager puts it, or maybe more like a government laboratory. Even the precise nature of the founders\u2019 collaboration\u2014who makes what decision and when\u2014is something of a mystery, and according to Herzog, that\u2019s just the way they like it. \u201cWe\u2019ve never really revealed what we do,\u201d he says. \u201cIt would be wrong.\u201d The coyness seems at odds with an office that also prefers to be \u201cf\u2014ing straightforward,\u201d as Herzog adds, punching the air with his fist. Then again, it\u2019s not clear that any explanation, either for the practice or for its projects, would be half as gratifying as the mental revolutions one experiences when encountering a Herzog & de Meuron building for the first time. With all that the architects\u2019 work has to reveal, their greatest innovations are the ones still waiting to be discovered.\n\nCorrections & Amplifications\n\nAn earlier version of this article had reversed the captions identifying Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron.

But hospitals in the state are already gearing up to oppose the effort.\n\nJulie Henry, a spokeswoman for the North Carolina Healthcare Association, which represents hospitals, said some believe the proposed rates wouldn\u2019t be sustainable for them, and the financial impact could be \u201cdevastating\u201d for about 20 hospitals that are operating on negative margins.\n\nHospitals are also concerned other employers and insurers would demand similar rates, Ms. Henry said.\n\n\u201cThis kind of change, and the ripple effects that might come from that, put hospitals and access to care at risk,\u201d Ms. Henry said. She said hospital officials are speaking to state legislators \u201cto determine what is a potential course of action they might look at to encourage a more workable solution.\u201d\n\nOfficials with the North Carolina Department of State Treasurer said they sought to set fair prices, including amounts they said could represent an average increase for independent primary-care doctors and some rural hospitals.\n\nMr. Folwell, a Republican, is elected by voters in the state, not appointed by lawmakers or the governor.\n\nThe North Carolina proposal will be closely watched by other states and government and private employers, health-care experts say, because it takes direct aim at the prices paid for health care in an effort to rein in spending.\n\nResearch from the nonprofit Health Care Cost Institute has pointed to the price of health care as the primary driver of the rising cost of employer coverage, rather than increasing use of services.\n\n\u201cAll purchasers, public and private, face the same pressures,\u201d said Robert Galvin, chief executive of Equity Healthcare, which negotiates contracts with health insurers and manages health-care costs on behalf of companies owned by big private-equity firms including Blackstone Group , where he is an operating partner. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a lot to learn, to see how it goes.\u201d\n\nThe effort faces serious challenges because of hospitals\u2019 clout. In some parts of North Carolina, big systems of hospitals have large market share, while small towns may have only one hospital. The state may find it difficult to assemble a network of hospitals across the state willing to take its rates.\n\nIf hospitals refuse to accept the rates that Mr. Folwell wants, the state plan says it will simply not include them in its network of providers. Yet that could leave workers who use those hospitals exposed to huge bills, because hospitals might demand they pay full charges, without the discounts that insurers typically negotiate.\n\nMr. Folwell said he is \u201ckeenly aware\u201d of the impact of out-of-network billing on consumers, and it is too soon to tell how the issue will play out. The State Employees Association of North Carolina, a union representing state workers, has said it supports the plan.\n\n\u201cThe state of North Carolina, the treasurer, is sending a powerful signal, but it will be hard to implement,\u201d said Jeff Levin-Scherz, a leader of the health management practice at Willis Towers Watson. \u201cThe danger is if they don\u2019t sign on the dotted line.\u201d\n\nAt least one other state, Montana, has implemented a plan similar to the North Carolina proposal.\n\nGetting hospitals to accept its rates, which were set at around 230% to 240% of Medicare\u2019s, \u201cdefinitely was a game of chicken,\u201d said Amy Jenks, the acting administrator who oversees the state\u2019s employee health plan, which covers around 30,000 people.\n\nOne hospital was still holding out when the plan launched in July 2016, with the state initially offering to pay travel expenses for workers to get to alternative hospitals, Ms. Jenks said. The holdout hospital agreed to join a few weeks later.\n\nMs. Jenks said the shift to Medicare-linked pricing has saved the state about $10 million over the two years it has been in place, leaving overall spending of $260 million over that span. Health plans covering Montana municipal and county employees have implemented similar setups, she said.\n\nWrite to Anna Wilde Mathews at anna.mathews@wsj.com", "Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is handing out fewer brass rings.\n\nThe Wall Street firm is set to name its smallest class of new partners in years this week, according to people familiar with the matter.

Instead, he took the stage surrounded by models and other members of his \u201cBalmain Army.\u201d\n\nSuch unorthodox gestures are typical of the 33-year-old Mr. Rousteing, a playful disrupter of luxury fashion\u2019s tradition and snobbery. Since becoming creative director of French house Balmain in 2011, he has favored a populist ethos rather than the elitist one that is in the DNA of many high-end labels.\n\nMr. Rousteing, (pronounced roo-STAHH), championed hip-hop music and performers like Rihanna and reality-TV fixture Kim Kardashian before other designers did. He also embraced racial diversity at a time when many luxury brands were ignoring the issue.\n\nMr. Rousteing, the first black creative director of a big luxury label in many years, says black designers at last are getting the recognition they merit. Photo: Laura Stevens for The Wall Street Journal\n\nAdopted from an orphanage by a white couple in Bordeaux when he was five months, Mr. Rousteing believes he is of mixed race and considers himself black. \u201cAll my life people might just say you\u2019re not black and you\u2019re not white, but I was black enough to be called a black designer because of the lack of diversity in fashion,\u201d said Mr. Rousteing, who is shooting a documentary about his life in which he tries to trace his origins. His Balmain appointment made him the first black creative director of a big luxury label in many years and the youngest creative director of a major fashion house since Yves Saint Laurent.\n\nWhen he started Instagramming in 2012, most luxury brands and designers were still controlling their images tightly to preserve a certain mystique. \u201cI remember people were like, \u2018You cannot show so much about yourself,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cThey were asking me to be a bit snobbish and I was like, \u2018This is not right. This is now, what is happening today.\u2019 \u201d Mr. Rousteing\u2019s 5 million followers gobble up a stream of selfies and other glimpses of his life, such as outfitting Beyonc\u00e9 for Coachella or attending the Met Gala. \u201cI think this was my own way to say I\u2019m not snobbish,\u201d he said.\n\nHis flashy, unapologetically sexy designs feature \u201ca lot of bling and a lot of shine,\u201d he said, their crisp tailoring conveying confident authority. \u201cBalmainiacs\u201d range from 23-year-old model Kendall Jenner to her mother Kris and France\u2019s first lady Brigitte Macron. Mr. Rousteing spoke to the Journal recently while in New York. Edited excerpts:\n\nCan luxury designer brands no longer afford to be snobbish or aloof?\n\nI think they are scared to not be cool\u2026I think the \u201ctrend\u201d today is trying to not be snobbish. It\u2019s funny to see that because the world of fashion will change and the people that will actually have successes are the people who are sticking to who they are. This is because right now you can recognize a brand that is trying to copy another and you can recognize a brand that actually sticks to who it is and really what it believes in.\n\nYou set out to make fashion less snobbish and exclusive. But doesn\u2019t it need to be exclusive?\n\nI think fashion needs to be exclusive, but exclusive doesn\u2019t mean not being inclusive. Fashion still needs to be a dream world, something that you kind of look up to\u2026But it has to be more inclusive, because the new generation\u2026needs to identify themselves. My work and my vision are about saying to the next generation: \u201cI will make sure that you can identify yourself into your dreams.\u201d\n\nWho Is He? Name : Olivier Rousteing\n\n: Olivier Rousteing What He Does : Fashion designer, creative director of Balmain\n\n: Fashion designer, creative director of Balmain How He Got There : Dropped out of fashion school in Paris, moved to Italy and at the age of 19, landed a job at Roberto Cavalli.

His Big Break : In 2011, after a year and a half designing at Balmain in Paris under creative director Christophe Decarnin, the 25-year-old Mr. Rousteing was promoted to creative director after Mr. Decarnin\u2019s abrupt departure.

Michael Jackson is a favorite. His Spring 2019 men\u2019s show in June was a homage to the King of Pop.\n\nDo fashion gatekeepers still exist?\n\nWe are living in a world where the consumers are stronger than the reviewers. Everybody has his own aesthetic, has his own taste, and no one is going to tell you what is beautiful or what is not beautiful, what is cool or what is not cool.\n\nWhere we are with diversity in the fashion industry?\n\nRight now a lot of people talk about diversity, which makes me really proud because that was a fight I had about eight years ago when I started at Balmain. And I can tell you that that word diversity was not a trend word. A lot of people were saying the way that I was so inclusive was kind of cheapening the fashion world\u2026I see some people today talking about inclusivity that were really actually exclusive three years ago! We have to be careful and not just say diversity\u2019s cool. Because it\u2019s not about being trendy, it\u2019s about pushing the world to go for a vision and an acceptance of what is the world today.\n\nWhy do you think there aren\u2019t more successful black designers?\n\nThere have always been incredible black designers. But I think before they were not recognized. The difference is that right now, finally, we can recognize them.\n\nAt Balmain\u2019s most recent fashion show, why did you incorporate virtual-reality technology?\n\nI wanted to be more inclusive. It was really important to open the fashion shows to a bigger audience.\n\nBy not just livestreaming your show?\n\nIt\u2019s the next step. Because the livestream is great but the VR with Oculus (a maker of virtual-reality headsets) is like you\u2019re sitting at the show\u2026My goal will be in a few years to make sure that the show can be seen by millions and millions of people that feel like they are sitting there.\n\nYou have praised Chanel creative director Karl Lagerfeld as \u201cthe best fashion inspiration in life.\u201d Any others at heritage fashion houses with his gift for courting millennials and not alienating older customers?\n\nNo. For me, Karl is the only one that has understood everything about fashion. He had a really old French house and made it really cool and still really relevant. He\u2019s really close to pop culture and at the same time has the old tradition of France. And it\u2019s not about putting sneakers on the runway.\n\nWhat is the fashion industry\u2019s biggest challenge?\n\nI feel like this is a transition. Everybody\u2019s going to go back to quality. To luxury. To creativity. The biggest challenge for the fashion industry is defining the codes of what is fashion. Who will remain in the fashion business will be people that actually embrace the new world, and who won\u2019t is people that will never understand. Fashion houses, all of them, have codes. But now is the time for defining the new codes and pushing the limits of precedent and pushing the limits of a lot of people that might be like, \u201cOh, we never do that at the house.\u201d But maybe it\u2019s time for you to do it.\n\nMr. Rousteing accepted an award from Fashion Group International last month in New York amid members of his \u2018Balmain Army.\u2019 Photo: Sean Zanni/Patrick McMullan\n\nWrite to Ray A.

It was something minor, like speaking up, or speaking too loudly. Her father read the note, then turned the paper over and looked at her. \u201c \u2018This is what she says you do,\u2019 he said to me,\u201d de la Pe\u00f1a recalls. \u201c \u2018Tell me about her. What does she do?\u2019 \u201d De la Pe\u00f1a listed some of her own unflattering observations about the teacher, and her father wrote them down on the back of the note, so that now the piece of paper contained two notes, two different perspectives. Then her father signed it. \u201cSo what does that make you do? Of course, it makes you think about the structure of things.... Of how situations are multidimensional.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Gregory Harris for WSJ. Magazine\n\nIt\u2019s not simply that observations are two-sided, but as multisided as there are individual witnesses, as infinitely sided as the world in all its depths and dimensions. The problem with the world, with reality, is that each of us is trapped within our own version of it (never, perhaps, has this been more true than in our present moment). So how do we shake ourselves out of our extremely personalized versions of reality? For de la Pe\u00f1a, the answer begins not just by flipping the paper over, but by changing the entire room.\n\nDe la Pe\u00f1a, 55, is the founder and CEO of Emblematic, a virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) studio based in Santa Monica, California. What de la Pe\u00f1a and her 15-person team do is relatively simple in concept and not at all simple in execution. The idea is to put people in places they wouldn\u2019t normally find themselves, experiencing situations they would not normally experience. Often, these are related to urgent issues, issues that are, in their sprawling complexity, seemingly difficult to grasp or even care about. But suddenly, there you are, standing in a cell in solitary confinement, or at the foot of a melting glacier, or before a protest line outside an abortion clinic. When you are in these places\u2014hearing the anguish of a prisoner, the calving of a glacier, the vitriol of the protesters\u2014the issues no longer seem like issues, with vague names attached, like prison reform or global warming or women\u2019s health. Rather, they seem like lived experience, like people you\u2019ve met and places you\u2019ve been\u2014like memory.\n\nThough it is still early days, study after study has shown how our minds categorize VR far differently than other, flatter mediums. All of the VR experiences de la Pe\u00f1a creates are grounded in reality. They are reported documentaries, in a sense. And so they become all the more memorable. De la Pe\u00f1a calls VR an \u201cempathy machine,\u201d because by putting you in places with people you may never have otherwise interacted with, you come to understand them far better than you did before.\n\nHow do we shake ourselves out of our extremely personalized versions of reality? Nonny de la Pe\u00f1a has the answer. Film by MediaStorm\n\nBut VR is still quite a young form, so de la Pe\u00f1a and her team must invent new methods\u2014lines of code or means of motion capture\u2014in order to build these environments. They must digitally reconstruct the spaces and the experiences, brick by brick, or byte by byte, innovating as they go.\n\nIn 2012, for example, the World Economic Forum commissioned de la Pe\u00f1a and Emblematic to create a piece on the Syrian refugee crisis. Part of the resulting work, Project Syria, involved meticulously reconstructing streets in Aleppo. You walk down a road and encounter a singing girl and then a mortar shell explodes and chaos ensues. A huge element of the impact of this experience was to allow the viewer to walk the streets freely. But this element was an advancement of de la Pe\u00f1a\u2019s work. Nearly all VR experiences outside a lab up to that point had been stationary, like putting a fishbowl over your head that you could look around in but couldn\u2019t swim through.\n\nTHE FUTURE LOOKS BRIGHT Nonny de la Pe\u00f1a, CEO and founder of Emblematic, a VR/AR studio based in Santa Monica, California. Hair, Dennis Gots; makeup, Lisa Storey. Photo: Gregory Harris for WSJ. Magazine\n\nJust a few months before she was to present her work at the World Economic Forum in 2014, de la Pe\u00f1a realized she would have to invent a new headset, because the headset she was using didn\u2019t allow for as much freedom of movement as she wanted. The headset is the essential piece of hardware in VR, the thing that allows the entire magic trick to work. It\u2019s not just the movie screen, but also the projector, the seat, the popcorn, the ticket booth\u2014the gateway to the entire experience.\n\nThe particular headset she had on hand, the one that wasn\u2019t doing all that de la Pe\u00f1a wanted it to do, was rather famous, as VR headsets go. Before she moved Emblematic to its Santa Monica offices, de la Pe\u00f1a had worked at the Mixed Reality Lab at the University of Southern California Institute for Creative Technologies. While there, one of her interns had helped build her this headset. That intern, Palmer Luckey, eventually launched a Kickstarter project off of a similar design to help fund his company, Oculus, which Facebook later bought for $3 billion. But in the ever-evolving world of VR, the headset Luckey had worked on for de la Pe\u00f1a had become, after a few years, ancient.\n\nSo de la Pe\u00f1a went about building herself an entirely new one. First, she tracked down a company that constructed lenses for NASA and used those lenses for the stereoscopic, depth-producing screens placed mere inches from your eyes. Then she purchased a 3-D printer so she could print and test parts for the rig. She set it up in her mom\u2019s garage, and her brother, Stephen Brown, and Thai Phan\u2014another engineer\u2014took over the prototyping. She found a motion-tracking system at a bankruptcy sale and bought it for $7,000. They spent hours, then days, then weeks, building and dismantling existing headsets to figure out how to construct their own. \u201cIt was such hubris to think that I could do this, that we could do this,\u201d she says, but she did it anyway. \u201cThis is what we want to do. I want to walk the streets in Aleppo. How do we reverse-engineer things to make this possible?\u201d Within a month, they had built two headsets you could walk around in.\n\nThe same year she was commissioned to make the Syrian refugee piece by the World Economic Forum, the director Alejandro G. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu met with de la Pe\u00f1a. He\u2019d sought her out because she was a pioneer in VR, and he was just getting interested in the possibilities of the form and thinking about doing a work of his own. Later, this would turn into the U.S.-Mexico border crossing experience called Carne y Arena (Virtually Present, Physically Invisible), a piece that won him a special achievement Academy Award.\n\n\u201cThe great challenge is to discover or to understand the visual grammar of this new medium,\u201d I\u00f1\u00e1rritu says, and with her expertise, de la Pe\u00f1a acts as a kind of translator. He continues, \u201cThis is another art, and we haven\u2019t yet discovered the grammatical language.\u201d Others working in VR readily lean on the tricks\u2014the language\u2014of mediums they understand (movies and videogames, mostly), but according to I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, de la Pe\u00f1a understands that \u201cat the heart of the form is still a reality, a reality lived by somebody else. What I discovered is the genius of Nonny is the way she knows how to balance fact against the limitations [of the form].\u201d As an example, he brings up Hunger in Los Angeles, an experience that was a special selection at the Sundance Film Festival.\n\nIn it, you stand in line at a food bank, and while you wait, the man in front of you collapses and begins convulsing. An ambulance arrives and you overhear paramedics say that the man is experiencing seizures resulting from his diabetes. It\u2019s an older piece, from 2012. The technology has changed considerably since then, and it shows. The renderings are simple and strange. Yet it is hugely affecting to be standing there looking down at a man\u2014even a poorly rendered one\u2014struggling to survive, right at your feet.\n\nSECOND SIGHT This headset\u2014Apollo\u2014was designed for Emblematic by artist Greg Brotherton based on earlier headsets de la Pe\u00f1a produced with her brother, Stephen Brown. Photo: Gregory Harris for WSJ. Magazine\n\nThe reason Hunger in Los Angeles works so well is simple: The audio is a recording of the lived experience as it happened in line at a food bank in downtown Los Angeles in 2010, captured by one of de la Pe\u00f1a\u2019s interns as her team researched and reported on the topic of hunger and food access across the city. \u201cYou don\u2019t care about how it looks so much,\u201d I\u00f1\u00e1rritu says, \u201cbecause you recognize that it is true.\u201d\n\nWHEN DE LA PE\u00d1A left Los Angeles for Harvard in 1980, she thought she would go into international politics. But she quickly fell in with documentary filmmakers, both students and professors, and received a university grant that allowed her to photograph and report on Chicano gangs in L.A.\u2019s Mar Vista Gardens housing projects. After she graduated, de la Pe\u00f1a returned to L.A. full time to work for the Associated Press during the 1984 Olympics. Soon after she relocated to Mexico to freelance as a journalist and then moved to New York City, joining Time as a stringer and, in 1987, Newsweek as a correspondent. (Meanwhile, determined to be a freelance photographer, she had converted a closet in her tiny apartment into a darkroom.)\n\nHer favorite reporting was similar to what she\u2019d done in Mar Vista Gardens: enough hanging out to impart a sense of being there, either through writing or photography. But she was increasingly attracted to documentary film and, beyond that, the possibilities of newer forms. She was an early evangelist of the internet and taught herself HTML and other computer languages. Also in the early 1990s, she read Virtual Reality, by Howard Rheingold, and somehow knew that this was what she\u2019d been waiting for.\n\nVirtual reality, as an idea in art, is ancient. A huge canvas depicting a battle, the foreground life-size\u2014that\u2019s early VR. So are mid-19th-century stereoscopic photos and viewers. So is an early-20th-century flight simulator. And so are the 1960s prototypes for what we now consider modern VR, chunky headsets attached to room-size computers that ran images that took up your entire field of vision. Virtual reality as a phrase didn\u2019t take hold until the 1980s, and virtual reality as a marketing tool arrived in the early 1990s (remember The Lawnmower Man or Nintendo\u2019s Virtual Boy?). But VR, until very recently, was extremely niche, usually expensive and often very bad. Only in the past five years has it become anything resembling mainstream\u2014Samsung, for example, advertised its VR headsets during the 2017 Super Bowl. But even so, VR headsets are found in very few households (6 percent of U.S. internet users ages 16 to 64 own a VR device, according to market-research firm GlobalWebIndex). Of these, the vast majority are using their headsets to play videogames.\n\nDe la Pe\u00f1a is both an early innovator in the form and an outlier, more concerned with capturing and bringing people into areas of our world than allowing them to leave our world behind. To get inspired, she says, \u201cI close my eyes and think about my body in the space. What\u2019s the best way to understand it if I were there?\u201d\n\nLater, she mentions a persistent worry she\u2019s had about this interview, that she would sound overly head-in-the-clouds, ungrounded, like \u201ca silly, dreamy woman.\u201d Part of the trouble is that because VR is a new form, the technical hurdles are worked out mostly on a computer screen. Talking about it, one can\u2019t help but sound a little dreamy, because we don\u2019t have the words yet.\n\nBut the bigger challenge is the fact of her gender in a male-dominated field. Once, when she was ticking through all the ways she scraped together the business and made payroll\u2014the grants and the pitches and the client work (including a historic re-creation of the Cartier mansion and an AR data visualization of the U.S. stock market for The Wall Street Journal\u2019s iPhone and Android apps) and the licensing fees for the technologies they had developed\u2014she indicated that Emblematic hadn\u2019t taken much outside investment. Was this a result of some principled stance? \u201cWhy haven\u2019t I taken [more] investment?\u201d She raises her eyebrows. \u201cI think you mean: Why haven\u2019t I gotten investment? Something like 98 percent of VC funding goes to guys. So. You see?\u201d\n\nThe Emblematic offices are in a squat two-story stucco building on the quiet, inland side of Santa Monica, near enough to de la Pe\u00f1a\u2019s home\u2014which she shares with her husband and kids\u2014that it takes her about 10 minutes on her electric bike to get to work. One hot, hazy August afternoon, de la Pe\u00f1a and her team\u2014which now includes New York City\u2013based co-founder Jamie Pallot\u2014are readying the rollout of a new project, Reach, an entirely original way to bring VR to the masses (a prototype was released earlier this year).\n\nReach is both a platform for WebVR content and a distributor of that content. It\u2019s also a set of tools for making WebVR experiences a bit more streamlined and accessible. The idea for Reach is many years old, and a lot of what Emblematic has been building for the past year is essentially a series of clever hacks to existing software and hardware. De la Pe\u00f1a\u2019s team is well-suited to this sort of work\u2014most of their inventions here have come out of their own needs, with limited means, resulting in software that makes a higher-end but not wildly expensive camera able to capture both spaces and people while adding depth or volume. This so-called volumetric capture isn\u2019t perfect, but Reach works well enough to allow a huge portion of people to suddenly create within this previously unplayable form.\n\nBy building the sense of space, de la Pe\u00f1a is able to trick you into believing in your presence in that space. This becomes all the more powerful when you are in a space with a person in it. You listen more intently because that person appears more real, because you believe\u2014if only for an instant\u2014that you are there with them. In one early demo of the Reach platform, de la Pe\u00f1a and her team captured a landscape in Utah canyon country, a lot of sandstone and open sky. But standing there on the rock with you are holograms of different people\u2014including one of musician Reggie Watts\u2014addressing you.\n\nDe la Pe\u00f1a\u2019s continuing goal with Reach is to capture more environments for people to tell their stories in. She\u2019d like to create a virtual space that is a segment of the walled U.S. border with Mexico, as well as the courtroom in the Supreme Court. Although we are constantly hearing about them, we rarely grapple with the places themselves, much less stand in them and listen. All de la Pe\u00f1a needs, she says, is \u201caccess to a place for, maybe, six hours, and now I can have a model for anybody to use whenever they want to use it.\u201d In this way, on the Reach platform, she and her team will build a database of environments.\n\nDe la Pe\u00f1a tries out a headset. Photo: Gregory Harris for WSJ. Magazine\n\nBut the places themselves are only half the challenge. The rest is up to all of us. In creating these virtual spaces for others to use, and building a tool kit for capturing and rendering people in depth within these spaces, de la Pe\u00f1a and her team are throwing the empathy machine out into the wider world. Perhaps, with Reach, we\u2019ve finally begun moving toward something post-internet, something less anonymous, that seems closer to the lived experience\u2014something kinder. But de la Pe\u00f1a says she isn\u2019t as concerned with kindness. There is a more important step first: listening. \u201cIf you and I were facing each other in the virtual world, would we begin to at least try to understand each other? Would we listen? Maybe. Probably. Yes.\u201d", "Katelyn Hodgson cradles her daughter, Frances, during a recent meeting of a group treatment program for perinatal anxiety at St. Joseph\u2019s Healthcare Hamilton in Hamilton, Ontario. Photo: Libby March for The Wall Street Journal\n\nHAMILTON, Ontario\u2014At a local hospital on a recent Monday, four women, all pregnant or new mothers, were learning how to cope better with their anxiety and depression\u2014medication not required.\n\nPsychologist Sheryl Green asked participants in her treatment program to share the results of their \u201cbehavioral activation\u201d homework, a strategy of regularly scheduling pleasurable activities and making yourself do them even if you don\u2019t feel up to them. The technique can improve mood.\n\nMercedes Elmore, 27 and pregnant at the time with a girl, told the group she took time to text with a friend while her husband and 8-year-old son played videogames. Jennifer, mother of four-month-old Sienna, dashed out for a solo trip to the mall to buy a new outfit for her 30th-birthday dinner. (Jennifer said she was uncomfortable with using her last name in this article.) Rachel Bakker, a 31-year-old mother of three, had a friend come over to watch the television show \u201cThis Is Us.\u201d\n\nMercedes Elmore shared with the group the results of her \u201cbehavioral activation\u201d homework, scheduling activities that bring pleasure. She gave birth to a baby girl on Nov. 1. Photo: Libby March for The Wall Street Journal\n\n\u201cIt was something to look forward to,\u201d Ms. Bakker said, while her youngest child, five-month-old Winston, sat on her lap and clutched a fuzzy toy chick.\n\nThe group is part of Dr. Green and her colleagues\u2019 treatment program for perinatal anxiety at St. Joseph\u2019s Healthcare Hamilton. It is one of a small but growing number of psychological therapy programs that are specifically designed for pregnant and postpartum women who struggle with anxiety and depression. They address a critical need. While scientific studies have generally found that antidepressant medications are safe to use during pregnancy and breast-feeding, there are still some concerns about their impact on babies.\n\nSome doctors encourage women to avoid the drugs during the perinatal period, especially those patients with mild illness. And many women, even some with severe depression and anxiety disorders, simply refuse to take them while pregnant or breast-feeding.\n\nMs. Hodgson has struggled with depression and anxiety for several years. Her symptoms surged during her third trimester. \u2018I was feeling unmotivated, unhappy and worthless,\u2019 she said. Photo: Libby March for The Wall Street Journal\n\nFor \u201cwomen who cannot or choose not to take medication, you need an alternative,\u201d says Dr. Green, an assistant professor in the department of psychiatry and behavioral neurosciences at McMaster University.\n\nAlso, some women who stay on medication continue to have symptoms: Adding psychotherapy to antidepressants could help keep them well.\n\nAnxiety disorders and depression are common during pregnancy and the postpartum period. About 13% of women experience depression during pregnancy. And studies estimate that anywhere from 12% to 39% will have an anxiety disorder. Many women experience both. \u201cHormones may contribute to worsening of mood or anxiety in some women,\u201d says Marlene P. Freeman, associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School. \u201cPregnancy and postpartum is a major life transition. There are sleep changes, stress and worry about having a baby.\u201d\n\nAbout 10% of pregnant women in the U.S. receive prescriptions for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, the family of antidepressant medications that include Prozac and Zoloft. Studies have found that about two-third of women with a history of depression who stop their medications while pregnant will relapse.\n\nRachel Bakker holds her son, Winston. During the session, the women in the treatment program practiced a deep breathing exercise. Photo: Libby March for The Wall Street Journal\n\n\u201cIf you have untreated depression and anxiety disorders during pregnancy, you\u2019re bound to have a higher exposure to things that are not good for the baby such as alcohol or smoking or drugs,\u201d says Maureen Sayres Van Niel, a reproductive psychiatrist in Cambridge, Mass. and president of the American Psychiatric Association\u2019s Women\u2019s Caucus. \u201cAnd it\u2019s going to have an effect on the amount you can attach with your baby.\u201d\n\nDepression during pregnancy is linked to an increased risk of preterm birth and lower birth weight in babies. High anxiety during pregnancy has been linked to ADHD symptoms in children.\n\nThe new perinatal programs adapt longstanding, effective psychological treatments for anxiety and depression. St. Joseph\u2019s uses cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a treatment where patients are taught to identify unhelpful thoughts, challenge them and replace them with more realistic ones. Researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis are using interpersonal psychotherapy, which focuses on improving relationships as a way to relieve depression symptoms, with pregnant patients. Massachusetts General Hospital and the MGH Institute of Health Professions are studying the use of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, which involves yoga and meditation practice, to treat pregnant women with anxiety disorders.\n\nThe new programs modify treatments to be more accessible and relevant to pregnant women and new mothers. They often consist of fewer sessions: St. Joseph\u2019s program, for example, meets only six times, whereas a typical course of CBT would include 12 to 18 sessions. Babies are welcome.\n\nThe program at St. Joseph\u2019s is covered by Canada\u2019s universal health insurance system and is free for participants.\n\nKatelyn Hodgson, one of the program\u2019s participants, has struggled with depression and anxiety for several years. Antidepressants helped alleviate her symptoms but she stopped taking the medication as soon as she found out she was pregnant with her daughter Frances, who goes by Frankie, now four months old. \u201cI was just worried [the medication] was going to go to her and I didn\u2019t know what it would do,\u201d said the 27-year-old social-media and public-relations manager.\n\nBut her symptoms surged during her third trimester, and Ms. Hodgson went back on medication. \u201cI was feeling unmotivated, unhappy and worthless. I didn\u2019t understand how I could feel so bad when something so great was happening,\u201d she said. Ms. Hodgson stopped taking the medication again, worried that Frankie would be exposed to it through her breast milk. She began St. Joseph\u2019s perinatal program when Frankie was two months old. Her anxiety \u201cis less intrusive now,\u201d she says.\n\nDuring St. Joseph\u2019s program, women learn to identify and change their \u201cthinking errors,\u201d those catastrophic thoughts that can fuel depression and anxiety (If someone else holds my baby, she will get sick, for example). They learn to put them on trial, writing down tangible evidence for and against the thoughts. They are also taught to change behaviors that can fuel anxiety, such as spending hours online researching labor and delivery complications. Every week, the women get homework assignments to practice the new skills.\n\nOn that recent Monday, Dr. Green\u2019s colleague, psychologist Eleanor Donegan, led the women in a deep breathing exercise. \u201cIt is just a message to your brain to slow down and relax a bit,\u201d Dr. Donegan said. The women closed their eyes and the room went silent except for the occasional coos and gurgles from Frankie and Winston.\n\nIn a small pilot study of the program published in 2015 in the Archives of Women\u2019s Mental Health involving 10 women with no control group, the treatment led to a statistically significant reduction in anxiety and depression symptoms. Dr. Green and her colleagues are finishing up a larger randomized controlled trial.\n\nMs. Elmore has found the strategies to change thinking errors particularly helpful. She has seen a psychiatrist for several years for generalized anxiety disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder, but has always resisted medication. With this pregnancy, her anxiety surged.\n\n\u201cAt first, I worried about miscarriage. As time went on and I hit 20 weeks, I worry about her being stillborn,\u201d said Ms. Elmore, an early childhood educator. Now when she gets anxious, she \u201clooks at the evidence for that anxious thought and the evidence against it,\u201d she said. \u201cI find myself thinking more balanced thoughts.\u201d Ms. Elmore gave birth Thursday to a baby girl.\n\nMs. Hodgson said perhaps the biggest benefit from St. Joseph\u2019s program was the validation and support she received from the other women. \u201cIt makes you feel like there are other people that struggle just as much and that is OK,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can find a way to get through it.\u201d", "When the Broad opened in 2015, the Los Angeles museum\u2019s contemporary-art collection, downtown location and free admission quickly attracted a young, diverse audience. According to survey data it released in 2016, over 70% of its visitors were 34 years old or younger, and six out of 10 identified as nonwhite.\n\nThis year, the museum turned its attention to the diversity of its staff. While other museums and organizations around the U.S. have made a push to hire more curators and directors of color, the Broad put a special emphasis on art handlers, the people responsible for packaging, transporting, storing and installing the increasingly complex artworks produced today. A 2015 report by the Mellon Foundation found that 85% of museum art handlers in the U.S. were white, and 75% were male.\n\nWith these statistics in mind, the Broad started by adjusting its job listings, cutting the art-handling experience requirement to two years from six, nixing the college-degree requirement and no longer stipulating that workers needed their own vehicle. After receiving a grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services in 2017, the museum took these efforts a step further by creating the Diversity Apprenticeship Program, an effort to bring more nonwhite and female handlers into the field.\n\nUnpacking With Care\n\nPhoto: l\n\nThe first class of eight students began the nine-month program this fall, earning $16 an hour (Los Angeles minimum wage is currently $13.25 for large employers), as well as benefits and public-transit vouchers. After the first month, the apprentices began rotations at partner sites around Los Angeles, including LACMA, the California African American Museum and the Autry Museum of the American West.\n\nOne of the new apprentices is Nya Abudu, shown positioning and unpacking Nina Chanel Abney\u2019s \u201cNear and Far,\u201d who was interested in art handling but didn\u2019t have any connections in the field.\n\n\u201cI thought it would always be a position that I could thrive in, that I would be good at,\u201d she says. \u201cI just didn\u2019t know how to get my foot in the door.\u201d\n\nGeorge Luna-Pe\u00f1a, program manager for the initiative, found that many of the people he approached about the program didn\u2019t know what art handlers did. \u201cThey didn\u2019t realize it was a potential career path for them,\u201d he says.\n\nPrepping the Exhibition Space\n\nLillian Wimberly, above left, one of the apprentices, applies gold leaf to an exhibition wall alongside intern Koren Salajka, part of the preparations to install Sherin Guirguis\u2019s \u201cOf Thorns and Love\u201d show at the Craft and Folk Art Museum.\n\nHands-on projects like this, as well as painting walls between installations and protecting artworks while preparations are under way, above, are part of the Broad\u2019s training program.\n\nInstalling the Work\n\nEduardo Camacho, above, installs works in the Vincent Price Art Museum\u2019s \u201cRegeneraci\u00f3n: Three Generations of Revolutionary Ideology.\u201d (A photo of his dog Mugzy can be seen on his tape measure.)\n\nHe was working at the Broad in visitor services when he applied and was accepted to the apprenticeship program. \u201cGrowing up, I didn\u2019t really have access to any sort of museums,\u201d he says.\n\nHis parents, who immigrated from Mexico in the 1970s, pushed Mr. Camacho to finish his college education even though he loved working with his hands. To him, the tactile nature of the art-handler job felt like a perfect fit.\n\nMaintaining the Art\n\nVanessa Garcia, above, who is working at the Broad, uses a variety of cleaning tools to care for works like these Jeff Koons sculptures.\n\nThere is some precedent for programs like the Broad\u2019s. In the late 1990s, the Bronx Council on the Arts in New York began offering a free art-handling course, fielding hundreds of applications, before it ended the program last year. The Broad hopes to create a Diversity Apprenticeship Program \u201ctoolbox\u201d that can be adopted by other organizations and to make their training materials available digitally.\n\n\u201cMuseums, when they look at diversity inclusion and equity, [shouldn\u2019t look] just at executive and curatorial areas,\u201d says Joanne Heyler, the Broad\u2019s founding director. \u201cCast a wide net in that regard and look at the entirety of the museum staff.\u201d\n\nThe first cohort of apprentices is several months into their training program. The Institute of Museum and Library Services\u2019s grant funds two years of the program, so a second class of eight students will follow.\n\nThe Broad received 767 applications this year for the first eight spots. Eighty-four percent of them, Mr. Luna-Pe\u00f1a says, were people of color, and over half reported household income under $20,000.\n\nThe Broad's Diversity Apprenticeship Program participants, top row from left: Alicia Teele, Vanessa Garcia, Eduardo Camacho, Annamarie Le\u00f3n.

But 60-year-old Ben Hart is addicted to breakdancing.\n\nMr. Hart may not win any competitions, but he\u2019s a fan favorite, garnering 27,000-plus Instagram views in hours.\n\n\u201cThe first time I watched a competition I was in awe of the athleticism,\u201d he says of breaking, which he first saw up close in 2011. \u201cI was intimidated to try it.\u201d Although he could barely do a basic move\u2014one veteran told him he looked like he was in the Ice Capades\u2014he says breaking was more fun than the treadmill.\n\nMr. Hart, an advertising copywriter who works from his homes in Chicago and Fort Lauderdale, Fla., used to run and lift weights. He wasn\u2019t seeing results. So he hired well-known Chicago breakdancer Shorty Brick to give him lessons. After one year of breaking he lost 30 pounds. \u201cIt\u2019s like nonstop sprinting,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s more dance than sport, but with an athletic component that is very dynamic and explosive.\u201d\n\nB-boying or b-girling, as breaking is also known, consists of three main elements. Top rock moves are performed standing up. Down rock moves like drops and spins take place on the floor. And a freeze is a pose where the dancer stops moving mid-set, often while balancing.\n\n\u201cTop rock is just dancing on your feet, but there are certain moves basic to b-boying that give it a certain look,\u201d Mr. Hart says.\n\nMr. Hart competes under the b-boy name Benihana, a riff on his name that a friend came up with. Competitions are known as battles and dancers don\u2019t get to choose their music. The beats constantly change throughout the performance. \u201cMusicality is the hardest part for me,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t grow up with this music culture, and trying to flow on-beat is a struggle.\u201d\n\nHe says breaking has also allowed him the opportunity to interact with communities he probably would not have found otherwise. \u201cI\u2019ve met so many creative people,\u201d he says. Most are decades younger.\n\nHe recently competed in the 2018 Silverback Open Championships in Philadelphia, which included some of the world\u2019s top breakers. Mr. Hart didn\u2019t advance beyond the preliminaries. \u201cAt my age, I may not break well, but it\u2019s amazing I break at all,\u201d he says.\n\nMr. Hart prepares for competition. He says his best power moves are windmills, head spins, handstands and freezes, where he supports himself on his hand and elbow with his feet in the air. Photo: Ryan Collerd for The Wall Street Journal\n\nThe Workout\n\nMr. Hart calls himself fanatical about practicing 90 minutes to two hours a day in his basement. He runs through foundational footwork sequences. He warms up with moves like the six-step, where he uses his hands to support his upper body as he takes six steps to move his legs in a circle. \u201cIt\u2019s like trying to do the gymnastics pommel horse but on the floor,\u201d he says.\n\nHe can now do 100 push-ups while holding various breaking poses. He throws push-ups between his six-step moves in workouts and can push up into a handstand. He practices windmills, a move where he rolls across his upper chest, shoulders and back while twirling his legs in a V-shape in the air, and spins on his head. He stretches throughout the day.\n\nOn Wednesday nights he practices for up to three hours at a community outreach space in a Chicago suburb. \u201cI lose about 4 pounds of water weight from breaking so hard,\u201d he says. He competes locally almost every weekend.\n\nThe Diet\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t pay that much attention to my diet,\u201d Mr. Hart confesses. \u201cFrankly, I like McDonald\u2019s and pizza.\u201d He has been trying to eat a more balanced diet, adding vegetables, fish and lean protein to his meals. Breakfast is fruit and eggs. A McDonald\u2019s Quarter Pounder with Cheese is still often lunch. His wife prepares healthy dinners of chicken and salad. His splurge is a steak from Morton\u2019s the Steakhouse. Trail mix, bananas and water fuel him through breakdancing competitions.\n\nThe Gear & Cost\n\n\u201cOne of the appeals is that there is basically no cost,\u201d he says. \u201cYou just need to find some floor space.\u201d He put a 12-foot-by-12-foot sheet of vinyl on top of carpet padding on his basement floor.\n\nHis Wednesday night sessions are free to the public. Most breakers wear track suits. \u201cPolyester or acrylic fabrics are slippery and make it easier to spin on the floor,\u201d he says.\n\nMr. Hart goes for a \u201cman off the street\u201d look. He often wears a Hawaiian shirt. He says you want shoes that shuffle but don\u2019t slide, and you want to avoid a big heel. Converse and Puma work well, he says. He says it isn\u2019t cool to wear a cap, but he wears a padded headspin beanie ($27). \u201cI\u2019m bald and the floor hurts,\u201d he explains. He also wears wrist guards.\n\nThe Playlist\n\nHe likes listening to \u201cNow We Are Free,\u201d the instrumental theme song from \u201cGladiator,\u201d while working out at home. \u201cPersonally, I don\u2019t like breaking music,\u201d he says. \u201cI prefer club music. It\u2019s easier for me to follow.\u201d\n\nThe Evolution of Breaking Breakdancing is an urban dance style that originated in the mid-1970s on the streets and clubs of New York City. The earliest innovators were young African-American and Puerto Rican dancers. By the mid-1980s, breaking had become a global phenomenon. The first large-scale, formally judged breakdancing competition, now known as the Battle of the Year, took place in 1990. It attracted breaking crews, or teams, from around the world. Today, there is an active competitive scene with professional tours. Events in competitions consist of battles between two breakers or two teams. Dancers are judged on technique and variety, musicality and performance, and creativity and personality. The International Olympic Committee added breaking to the 2018 Youth Olympic Games, which took place in Buenos Aires in October.\n\nWhat\u2019s your workout?

Who needs Mr. Big?", "The Food and Drug Administration on Friday approved a powerful new opioid drug called Dsuvia that has possible uses for treating wounded soldiers on the battlefield.\n\nConsumer representatives say the drug is especially potent and particularly susceptible to abuse. Balancing those dangers against needs for powerful painkillers in certain settings has been a dilemma for the FDA amid a national overdose epidemic.\n\nThe approval for AcelRx Pharmaceuticals \u2019s ACRX 3.17% lead treatment calls for Dsuvia to be administered by a health-care professional, for example a paramedic during transport, using a single-dose, prefilled, under-the-tongue applicator. It won\u2019t be available at retail pharmacies or for home use, the FDA said, adding that patients shouldn\u2019t take it for more than 72 hours. Similar to other opioids, Dsuvia will also carry a boxed warning about the serious risks of misuse and abuse.\n\nThe commissioner of the FDA, Scott Gottlieb, took the unusual step of addressing the drug\u2019s abuse risk, even as he pointed out its potential use to treat injured soldiers.\n\nThe medicine, Dr. Gottlieb said in a statement, \u201chas some unique features in that the drug is delivered in a stable form that makes it ideally suited for certain special circumstances where patients may not be able to swallow oral medication.\u201d He said this specifically includes wartime and noted that the Department of Defense worked closely with the drug\u2019s developer, AcelRx Pharmaceuticals.\n\n\u201cThis opioid formulation, along with Dsuvia\u2019s unique delivery device, was a priority medical product for the Pentagon,\u201d Dr. Gottlieb said, \u201cbecause it fills a specific and important, but limited, unmet medical need in treating our nation\u2019s soldiers on the battlefield.\u201d\n\nThe FDA also said it had signed a memorandum of understanding with the Defense Department to expedite availability of medical products, particularly those used to treat injuries in battlefield settings.\n\nOthers weren\u2019t convinced that the drug\u2019s benefits outweighed potential risks. \u201cIt is certain that Dsuvia will worsen the opioid epidemic and kill people needlessly,\u201d Dr. Sidney Wolfe, founder and senior adviser of Public Citizen\u2019s Health Research Group, said in a statement.\n\nPublic Citizen and Dr. Raeford Brown, chair of the FDA\u2019s Anesthetic and Analgesic Drug Products Advisory Committee, last month warned the agency not to approve the drug.\n\nDr. Gottlieb said there are \u201cvery tight restrictions being placed on the distribution and use of this product.\u201d These limits, he said, include the restricted use of the drug to medically supervised health-care settings.\n\nDsuvia contains sufentanil, which is five to 10 times stronger than fentanyl, a synthetic opioid linked to thousands of overdose deaths in North America. President Trump last year declared opioid addiction a national public-health emergency.\n\nDsuvia, known as Dzuveo outside the U.S., is expected to be available in the U.S. in early 2019, according to the FDA. Dzuveo was approved by the European Union in July.", "After Robert Bowers stormed the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh on Oct. 27, far-right personality Ethan Ralph launched a live stream on YouTube to discuss the shooting that claimed 11 lives.
