(AP) \u2014 New Jersey rejected the state\u2019s down-and-out Republicans in the midterm elections and turned even more Democratic, sending at least 10, and potentially 11, of its 12 representatives to the next Congress from among the Democrats\u2019 ranks.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Bob Menendez defeated Republican Bob Hugin in Tuesday\u2019s midterm election by 10 percentage points, according to preliminary results. In the northern New Jersey suburbs, Democratic newcomers Tom Malinowski and Mikie Sherrill flipped Republican seats, with Malinowski defeating an incumbent.\n\nIn southern New Jersey, longtime state Sen. Jeff Van Drew turned a seat that had been held by Republicans for nearly a quarter-century.\n\nIn the still-undecided 3rd Congressional District, Democrat Andy Kim declared victory late Wednesday over Republican Rep. Tom MacArthur.\n\nThe Associated Press has not called that race. Kim led by over 2,000 votes in unofficial results, but MacArthur said in a statement that nearly 7,000 votes remained to be counted.\n\nVoters confirmed Democrats\u2019 advantage in a state where registration favored the party by over 900,000.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s huge,\u201d said Montclair State University political science professor Brigid Harrison. \u201cIn New Jersey, the blue wave was enough to overcome the strictures of gerrymandering.\u201d\n\nRepublican President Donald Trump, whose popularity is meager in New Jersey, appeared to factor into voters\u2019 decisions.\n\nNearly all New Jersey voters casting midterm election ballots said deciding who controls Congress played a role in their decision, according to a wide-ranging survey of the American electorate.\n\nAP VoteCast found most said that Trump was a factor in their vote, while a majority also said the country is headed in the wrong direction.\n\nAP VoteCast surveyed 3,821 voters and 667 nonvoters in New Jersey; the survey was conducted for The Associated Press by NORC at the University of Chicago.\n\nMenendez\u2019s win over Hugin, the former CEO of Celgene, came despite millions of dollars in negative advertising financed by Hugin\u2019s deep pockets.\n\nAP VoteCast found women favored Menendez by 3 to 5, enough to overcome a split of the vote among men. Black voters were another key, giving Menendez enough of their support to offset his Hugin\u2019s slight advantage among white voters.\n\nSuburban voters who made up a majority of New Jersey\u2019s voters also gave Menendez an edge.\n\nMenendez also fended off Hugin with a huge push from Democrats Gov. Phil Murphy and Sen. Cory Booker, a potential 2020 presidential nominee. Booker had told voters Monday that if they trusted him, then they should back Menendez.\n\nA central issue in the race was Menendez\u2019s tossed-out federal corruption case, which Hugin capitalized on, casting the incumbent as corrupt. Menendez always denied wrongdoing and instead focused on his record, particularly as a co-author of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIn House races, Malinowski, a former state department official under President Barack Obama, defeated five-term GOP Rep. Leonard Lance in the 7th District. Malinowski argued that despite Lance casting himself as a moderate, he failed to stop his Republican colleagues from enacting the 2017 tax overhaul.\n\nDemocrat Hillary Clinton narrowly won the district in 2016 over Trump.\n\nSherrill, a Navy veteran and onetime federal prosecutor, won in the 11th District over Republican Assemblyman Jay Webber. The seat was open because Republican Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen is retiring after 12 terms.\n\nSherrill focused on rolling back the 2017 federal tax overhaul\u2019s cap on state and local tax deductions and stressed her support for health care for everyone.\n\nVan Drew won in the 2nd District over Trump ally Seth Grossman, after Rep. Frank LoBiondo retired. Van Drew had said he would work hard to bring people together in a district Trump carried.\n\nIn the 3rd District, Kim promised before a raucous crowd at his headquarters in Mount Laurel that he would \u201cserve with honor and integrity\u201d and said he would \u201crestore civility\u201d to public office.\n\nMacArthur is seeking his third term and was running neck-and-neck against Kim, a former national security aide to Obama.

Bruce Poliquin, seeking re-election in the 2nd Congressional District, greets supporters at his election night party, Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2018, in Bangor, Maine. (Gabor Degre/The Bangor Daily News via AP)\n\nPORTLAND, Maine (AP) \u2014 Computer-assisted tallying under Maine\u2019s new voting system will be used to determine the winner of the state\u2019s 2nd Congressional District race between Republican U.S. Rep. Bruce Poliquin and Democrat Jared Golden.\n\nNeither candidate in the most expensive race in state history collected a majority of first-place votes under Maine\u2019s new ranked-choice voting method, which was used for the first time Tuesday in U.S. House and Senate races.\n\nThat triggers additional voting rounds in which last-place finishers in the four-way race are eliminated and the votes are reallocated.\n\nSecretary of State Matt Dunlap said Wednesday those calculations will begin Friday and will likely be completed sometime next week. The collection of ballots by couriers will begin Thursday.\n\nNeither candidate had much to say Wednesday about the start of the unfamiliar process, which has drawn scorn and praise among Mainers since being approved at the polls in 2016.\n\n\u201cWe are still waiting on the results, along with the citizens of the state of Maine,\u201d said Brendan Conley, a Poliquin spokesman.\n\nMaine used ranked ballots for the first time in primaries earlier this year and is the only state to do so. The system lets voters rank candidates on the ballot with provisions for candidate eliminations and additional tabulations. It\u2019s also used in about a dozen municipalities around the country.\n\nThe ranked-choice system comes into play only if no one wins a majority of first-place votes. If there\u2019s no majority, then the ballots will be shipped to Augusta and scanned into computers for additional tabulations.\n\nThe goal of the system is to ensure that the winning candidate has broad support by letting voters rank all of the candidates on the ballot. If a candidate is eliminated, then a voters\u2019 second choice could come into play.\n\nCritics fear a legal challenge if a candidate doesn\u2019t like the outcome. Brent Littlefield, another Poliquin spokesman, brushed aside the legal question early Wednesday.\n\nThere are legitimate concerns if the system will pass legal muster because of the one person, one vote principle, University of Maine political science professor Mark Brewer said. He also said he\u2019d heard reports that voters were confused by having separate ranked-choice ballots for federal elections and traditional ballots for state races.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re asking voters to vote under two different systems in the same election. It\u2019s confusing to a lot of people,\u201d he said.\n\nThe system was approved by Maine voters after winners of nine of the 11 previous gubernatorial winners failed to garner a majority. However, it was not used in Tuesday\u2019s governor\u2019s race or legislative races. That\u2019s because of concerns that the system violates the Maine Constitution for those races.\n\nPortland voter Robin Jameson said on Tuesday she thinks the voting method should be expanded to all races. She used it in Maine\u2019s other Congressional race, won handily by incumbent Democratic Rep. Chellie Pingree.\n\n\u201cPeople are unhappy and they want to shake things up,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m really happy with the ranked system.\u201d\n\nPoliquin, a two-term representative, was defending his seat against Golden in a closely watched race that attracted lots of spending and heated rhetoric. The race featured saturation television ad campaigns and Poliquin and Golden calling each other liars.\n\nGolden, a state representative and U.S. Marine Corps veteran, highlighted his military service while accusing Poliquin of trying to take away Mainers\u2019 access to affordable health care, pledging to create jobs and promising to protect gun rights.\n\nPoliquin touted the state\u2019s low unemployment rate and his efforts to cut taxes and press for fair trade deals.\n\nHe called Golden \u201ca young radical with a socialist agenda\u201d in an attempt to portray him as too far left for the district, which handed an electoral vote to Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer David Sharp contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "RAGLEY, La.

(AP Photo/Tatan Syuflana, File)\n\nJAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) \u2014 A crucial sensor was replaced on a Lion Air jet the day before it plunged into the Java Sea, and that sensor replacement may have exacerbated other problems with the plane, Indonesian investigators said Wednesday.\n\nThat sensor, known as the \u201cangle of attack\u201d sensor, keeps track of the angle of the aircraft nose to help prevent the plane from stalling and diving.\n\nEarlier this week, Indonesian officials hinted that airspeed indicators played a role in the deadly Oct. 29 crash that killed all 189 people on board.\n\nThe jet\u2019s airspeed indicator malfunctioned on its last four flights, and that problem was related to the sensor issue, said Soerjanto Tjahjono, chairman of Indonesia\u2019s National Transportation Safety Committee, on Wednesday.\n\nLion Air\u2019s first two attempts to address the airspeed indicator problem didn\u2019t work, and for the Boeing 737 MAX 8 plane\u2019s second-to-last flight on Oct. 28, the angle of attack sensors were replaced, Tjahjono said.\n\nOn the Oct. 28 flight, from Bali to Jakarta, the pilot\u2019s and copilot\u2019s sensors disagreed. The 2-month-old plane went into a sudden dive minutes after takeoff, which the pilots were able to recover from. They decided to fly on to Jakarta at a lower-than-normal altitude.\n\nThe next day, during the deadly crash, the plane hit the water at very high speed just 13 minutes after takeoff from Jakarta. Its flight crew had requested permission to return to the airport several minutes after taking off.\n\n\u201cThe point is that after the AOA (sensor) is replaced, the problem is not solved but the problem might even increase. Is this fatal? NTSC (National Transportation Safety Committee) wants to explore this,\u201d he said.\n\nEven if an angle of attack sensor on a jet is faulty, there\u2019s generally a backup system in place for the critical component, and pilots are trained to handle a plane safely if those sensors fail, airline safety experts said.\n\nThere are audio signals and physical warnings that can alert the pilot to malfunctioning equipment or other dangers, said Todd Curtis, director of the Airsafe.com Foundation.\n\n\u201cThey should have been completely engaged in what was going on inside that cockpit, and any kind of warning that came up, they would have been wise to pay attention to it,\u201d Curtis said.\n\nInvestigators are likely focused on how a single sensor\u2019s failure resulted in a faulty command that didn\u2019t take into account information from a second sensor, said John Cox, CEO of Safety Operating Systems.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what the crew knew and didn\u2019t know yet,\u201d Cox said. \u201cWe will.\u201d\n\nBoeing, which manufactured the Lion Air plane, issues safety-related bulletins, and had previously circulated instructions about what flight crews should do if sensors fail.\n\nIndonesia\u2019s National Transportation Safety Committee said it had agreed with Boeing on procedures that the airplane manufacturer should distribute globally on how flight crews can deal with \u201cangle of attack\u201d sensor problems.\n\nBut a Boeing statement said a safety bulletin, sent to airlines on Tuesday, directs flight crews to existing guidelines on how they should respond to erroneous \u201cangle of attack\u201d data. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear if it plans an update, though comments from Indonesian officials indicate they expect one.\n\nIndonesian investigators said their flight procedure recommendations to Boeing were based on how the flight crew responded to problems on the Bali-to-Jakarta flight.\n\n\u201cThe draft of what will be conveyed by Boeing this morning has been presented to us,\u201d said air accident investigator Nurcahyo Utomo.\n\n\u201cThere are some things that we ask for explanation and some that we ask to be removed, and there has been an agreement between the NTSC and Boeing to release a new procedure to all Boeing 737 MAX users in the world,\u201d he said.\n\nIndonesia\u2019s search and rescue agency on Wednesday extended the search effort for a second time, saying it will continue until Sunday. Body parts are still being recovered and searchers continue to hunt for the cockpit voice recorder.\n\nThe Lion Air crash is the worst airline disaster in Indonesia since 1997, when 234 people died on a Garuda flight near Medan. In December 2014, an AirAsia flight from Surabaya to Singapore plunged into the sea, killing all 162 on board.\n\nLion Air is one of Indonesia\u2019s youngest airlines but has grown rapidly, flying to dozens of domestic and international destinations.

Henry McMaster, who supported Donald Trump when few other Republicans would dare stick their necks out, has finally cemented his own right to the office he\u2019s held for nearly two years, and sought for much longer.\n\nThe longtime Republican politician was ebullient as he accepted victory Tuesday, defeating state Democratic Rep. James Smith. Flanked by his family and running mate Pamela Evette, McMaster said he\u2019d help South Carolina \u201cset a model for the whole country.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople are looking for good examples,\u201d McMaster told his enthusiastic supporters. \u201cI know I must stand two or three inches taller just because I represent the people of the great state of South Carolina, and I\u2019m thrilled to do it for four more years.\u201d\n\nTuesday\u2019s election is the first in which South Carolinians chose a governor and lieutenant governor on a shared ticket. With the win, Evette becomes the second woman elected to the state\u2019s second-highest office and the first Republican woman to do so.\n\nIt\u2019s also a high-profile win for Trump, who\u2019s been linked to McMaster since early 2016, when the then-lieutenant governor became the nation\u2019s first official elected to a statewide office to endorse Trump\u2019s presidential bid.\n\nAt the time, the move surprised many of McMaster\u2019s allies and friends in South Carolina\u2019s GOP establishment. But his wager paid dividends when Trump picked Nikki Haley as his U.N. ambassador, enabling McMaster to ascend to the governor\u2019s office.\n\nMcMaster, 71, served two terms as South Carolina\u2019s attorney general and previously led the state\u2019s Republican Party. He lost a previous gubernatorial bid, coming in third in a four-way GOP primary in 2010 to Haley.\n\nAlthough his position allowed him the mantle of running as an incumbent, McMaster drew four Republican challengers in the primary and was forced into a runoff where he ultimately defeated businessman John Warren.\n\nAP VoteCast found that Trump was not a factor for 42 percent of South Carolina voters as they cast their ballots this time. By comparison, 29 percent said a reason for their vote was to express support for Trump, and 29 percent said they voted to express opposition to Trump.\n\nVoters in South Carolina had mixed views of Trump: 54 percent said they approve of how he is handling his job as president, while 46 percent said they disapprove of Trump.\n\nAP VoteCast is a nationwide survey of about 138,000 voters and nonvoters conducted for The Associated Press by NORC at the University of Chicago.\n\nSmith, 51, has represented the Columbia area in the state Legislature for more than 20 years. The attorney was a JAG officer in the US Army Reserve and South Carolina Army National Guard but resigned his commission after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks to enlist in the infantry, ultimately serving in Afghanistan.\n\nCeding victory to McMaster on Tuesday night, Smith told supporters he\u2019s proud of the campaign he ran with his running mate, fellow state Rep. Mandy Powers Norrell.\n\n\u201cWe have to do everything we can to leave South Carolina better than we found it,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWe made great strides this time.\u201d\n\nRebecca Ellerton, 32, of Mount Pleasant, said she admires the Democrat, but cast her vote more against the Republican.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m more opposed to Henry McMaster than in support of James Smith, although I think James Smith is a great candidate and would serve our state well as governor,\u201d she said.\n\nClay Counts, a 25-year-old tech salesman from Liberty, said he respects Smith but felt McMaster had done well enough to merit his own four-year term.\n\n\u201cI think Gov. McMaster will do a good job of being an ambassador of South Carolina to bring in new industry,\u201d Count said. \u201cI like the leadership he has shown in his interim and would like for him to continue serving.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMeg Kinnard can be reached on Twitter at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "This image released by Sony Pictures shows Claire Foy in a scene from \"The Girl in the Spider's Web.\" (Reiner Bajo/Sony Pictures via AP)\n\nNo, \u201cThe Girl in the Spider\u2019s Web\u201d isn\u2019t a Spider-man spinoff about a young woman ensnarled by Peter Parker. But you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking the latest, revamped iteration of Stieg Larsson\u2019s thrillers has some superhero DNA.\n\nThis, Lisbeth Salander\u2019s third big-screen incarnation in nine years, has morphed the avenging Stockholm hacker into a blander action hero, complete with a Batman-and-Robin-like band of white across her eyes. Following the spikier Swedish trilogy, with Noomi Rapace, and David Fincher\u2019s menacing and murky \u201cThe Girl With the Dragon Tattoo,\u201d with Rooney Mara, we can almost palpably feel Lisbeth (Claire Foy this time) being lured out of the shadows and toward a more mainstream movie realm. In this latest chapter, Lisbeth strives, like a Scandinavian 007, to keep a world-threatening atomic weapons program dubbed \u201cFirefall\u201d out of the wrong hands. (Are there any right ones?)\n\n\u201cThe Girl in the Spider\u2019s Web,\u201d directed by Uruguayan-born Fede Alvarez (\u201cDon\u2019t Breathe,\u201d 2013\u2032s \u201cEvil Dead\u201d reboot), smooths away some of the rough edges of a saga predicated on them, resulting in a competent but indistinguishable thriller. Lisbeth, a volatile cyberpunk vigilante propelled by her own demons of abuse, remains a great character in search of a decent plot.\n\nIt\u2019s a shame, too, because a fearsome woman meting out justice for detestable men is, well, kind of appropriate right now. In the film\u2019s first scene \u2014 the most comic book-like of them all \u2014 Lisbeth strings up an offending husband like a fish while gutting his bank account and, with a few clicks, transferring his savings to his victimized wife. Batman could do no better.\n\nSuch exchanges, though, quickly recede in favor of a larger conspiracy that ropes in the NSA (Lakeith Stanfield plays an agent), a Russian gang called the Spiders (with Claes Bang) and the Swedish authorities. It begins when Salander is approached by a former NSA agent (Stephen Merchant) who built the software program but who now (only now?) is concerned that the ability to launch every nuclear weapon on the planet might actually be a bad idea.\n\nSoon, all manner of bad guys are after him, his young but brilliant son (Christopher Convery) and Salander. The investigative journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Sverrir Gudnason in the part previously Daniel Craig and Michael Nyqvist) is around at times but makes little of an impression.\n\nThe story also connects, we sense, somehow to Salander\u2019s own past, her incestuous father and a sister believed to have died years ago. Snippets of flashbacks give a window into the scars beneath Salander\u2019s tattoos, while de rigueur action set pieces propel the movie slowly along, as if it forgot to pick up a sense of suspense along the way.

But vehicle safety is changing dramatically. The latest vehicles have safety features that can help prevent an accident in the first place. A potential problem, however, is that drivers aren\u2019t fully ready for them.\n\nAccording to a 2018 report by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety , a significant number of drivers with new vehicles don\u2019t know what these new advanced driver safety systems can do. Others do not trust them or assume they provide greater security than they actually do. If your car has some of these advanced safety systems, or you\u2019re planning on buying a new car soon, here\u2019s what you need to know.\n\nADVANCED SAFETY FEATURES HELP PREVENT CRASHES\n\nThe most common advanced driver safety aids include forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking; lane departure warning or lane keeping assist; blind-spot monitoring; and rear cross-traffic alert and/or rear automatic braking. In general, these systems use a variety of sensors to identify and warn the driver about possibly hazardous situations. If the driver doesn\u2019t take action, the vehicle can also potentially mitigate or avoid an accident by applying its own corrective braking and steering.\n\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has studied these technologies by comparing rates of police-recorded crashes and insurance claims for vehicles with and without the features. For example, the rate of front-to-rear crashes involving a vehicle with a forward collision warning system and automatic braking is 50 percent lower than when a car without such a system is involved.\n\nHOW TO SHOP FOR A CAR WITH THESE FEATURES\n\nThe rapid change in safety technology is difficult for car shoppers to assimilate. Few people pay attention to new features in the car market until it\u2019s time to buy a new car. Automakers try to explain and hype their own systems, but the various branded names such as Safety Sense P, Co-Pilot360 and SafetyTec can just sound like a lot of mumbo jumbo to the uninitiated.\n\nAdditionally, the availability of these features can vary greatly. Certain models might offer them, but only as options and only on certain trim levels. Take the popular Chevrolet Traverse crossover SUV, for example. Blind-spot monitoring is either not available, optional or standard depending on which trim level and powertrain you select. Want forward collision warning, automatic braking and lane departure warning? They aren\u2019t available at all until you pony up for the Traverse\u2019s most expensive trim levels.\n\nWalking into a dealership and just picking a vehicle off the lot is a recipe for confusion and not getting what you want. A better way is to do your research beforehand. For a new vehicle you\u2019re interested in, look up on the internet what the automaker calls its safety features and examine the features associated with the vehicle\u2019s trim levels. You can also ask a knowledgeable salesperson.\n\nLEARN HOW YOUR CAR\u2019S FEATURES OPERATE\n\nYou\u2019ve bought a car that has these advanced safety features. Now what? For example, what if your car starts beeping at you? Did you cross a lane marker? Approach a car ahead too quickly? Not use your turn signal? If you don\u2019t recognize the warning signal, it might be too late to react. Many respondents in the AAA survey noted they weren\u2019t sure how these features operated in their vehicles until after they owned them. Useful explanations from the dealership salesperson at the time of purchase can be hit or miss.\n\nThe solution is to familiarize yourself with the operation of your car as much as possible. Reading the owner\u2019s manual and watching online videos from the manufacturer are good steps to take. Another resource is MyCarDoesWhat, a site sponsored by the National Safety Council and the University of Iowa. And, in general, just remember that these systems exist to support your driving, not take it over fully. The autonomous car isn\u2019t here yet.\n\nEDMUNDS SAYS: Advanced safety features are becoming available on more new cars each year. Smart car shoppers should do their research to make the most of them.\n\n____\n\nThis story was provided to The Associated Press by the automotive website Edmunds.

But Chinese authorities have promised to avoid a \u201ccompetitive devaluation\u201d to help exporters who face U.S. tariff hikes in a fight over Beijing\u2019s technology policy.\n\nThe yuan, also known as the renminbi, or \u201cpeople\u2019s money,\u201d sank to a 10-year low of 6.9756 per dollar at the end of October, coming close to breaking the level of seven to the greenback.

But those are pushing down on the yuan as China\u2019s economy cools and interest rates in the two countries head in different directions.\n\nThe exchange rate is set each morning and allowed to fluctuate by 2 percent against the dollar during the day. The central bank can buy or sell currency \u2014 or order Chinese commercial banks to do so \u2014 to dampen price movements.\n\nA weaker yuan also might encourage an outflow of capital from the world\u2019s second-largest economy.

(AP Photo/Duane Burleson)\n\nDETROIT (AP) \u2014 A Detroit Red Wings home game looks and sounds a little like a memorial these days.\n\nThe lights are dimmed as images of the franchise\u2019s glorious past flash digitally onto the ice before the puck drops, reminding the relative few fans in the stands how good things used to be. And, they were good. Really good.\n\nDetroit\u2019s 11 Stanley Cup banners are lowered from the rafters where retired jerseys are also displayed, rekindling memories of the four titles from 1997 to 2008 and the seven championships from 1936-55. The most successful U.S.-based NHL franchise has had some of the game\u2019s all-time greats wear its sweater, adorned with a winged well, from Gordie Howe to Steve Yzerman and Nicklas Lidstrom.\n\nThe good times fade during the lights-and-sounds pregame show as the pace of the music picks up and a video montage shows the current team, mostly a mix of role-playing veterans and not-ready prospects. When the lights are turned up closer to game time, more seats appear to be empty than occupied on some nights.\n\nDetroit is among the worst teams in the league this season \u2014 as expected and by design. The Red Wings hope a painfully poor season will help get them on the fast track to retool with difference-making players in the draft along with some help from veterans in free agency.\n\n\u201cI knew it was coming and I was prepared for it,\u201d said Red Wings senior vice president Jim Devellano, who is in his 37th season with the team and his 52nd in the NHL. \u201cI don\u2019t like it. It upsets me, but not to the point that I\u2019m going to go off the deep end.\u201d\n\nThe Red Wings appear destined to miss the playoffs for a third straight year after a remarkable run of 25 consecutive postseason appearances. Other than the current players and coaches, who are trying to win every game, losing is seen as a necessary evil. Some fans, though, appear to be so fed up they don\u2019t even sit in seats they paid for to attend games.\n\nIn an effort to make the sparsely filled sections at Little Caesars Arena stand out less in person and on TV, the backs of red seats have been temporarily covered in black. They will eventually be replaced by black chairs at a considerable cost in a 1-year-old arena that is the centerpiece of a $1.2 billion project.\n\nDetroit got off to the worst start in franchise history by opening with seven losses and winning only one of its first 10 games. The Red Wings have bounced back with four wins in their last five.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it takes the sting out of the slow start, but it\u2019s something to build off of for sure,\u201d forward Justin Abdelkader said during the recent surge.\n\nWinning could prove to be counterproductive for the Motor City\u2019s hockey team this season.\n\nPart of what has held the Red Wings\u2019 rebuilding effort back is the fact they haven\u2019t had a No. 1 overall pick in the draft in recent years to get a generational player. If they lose enough this season and have some luck in the NHL draft lottery to get the top pick, Jack Hughes would give the franchise and its followers a desperately needed boost. Hughes is a playmaking center for USA Hockey\u2019s 18-under team, which trains and plays in suburban Detroit. His skill would help the team on the ice, though perhaps not right away, and his presence would provide a boost in interest for a team struggling to regain its standing as one of the most popular in a sports-crazed state.\n\nThe Red Wings have also hurt their chances of continuing the success they had for two-plus decades by drafting players, particularly on the blue line, that didn\u2019t pan out. And while Detroit is close to the bottom in the NHL standings, its payroll is larger than about 20 teams in the league.\n\nThe team has invested in its 2014 first-round pick, 22-year-old center Dylan Larkin , by giving him a $30.5 million, six-year contract last summer. It is trying to surround him with players to push the franchise back toward the playoffs and eventually championship contention.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to rebuild by drafting, developing and being patient,\u201d general manager Ken Holland said early in his 22nd season in charge and 36th with the franchise. \u201cI believe we\u2019re headed in the right direction with a lot of young kids we think are ready to come of age.\u201d\n\nChris Ilitch, the most powerful person in the organization, seems to agree with him. The president and CEO of Ilitch Holdings, which owns the team and the arena, gave Holland a two-year contract earlier this year to continue guiding a long-term rebuilding project that is counting on 30-plus draft picks from 2017-19.\n\n\u201cKenny Holland has done a marvelous job at accumulating picks, which are so important to executing a successful rebuild,\u201d Ilitch said. \u201cI think you\u2019re starting to see the fruits of the labor.\u201d\n\nGAME OF THE WEEK\n\nThe defending champion Washington Capitals host Pittsburgh on Wednesday night, the first meeting between the teams since the Penguins won their season opener.

Only then did Mahoney say Kemp is certain of victory and preparing to take office in January.\n\n\u201cWe are declaring victory,\u201d Mahoney said. Another campaign official, Austin Chambers, added: \u201cThe message here is pretty simple: This election is over, and the results are clear.\u201d\n\nKemp was not on the call but is expected to speak publicly on Thursday, the same day that a federal judge in Atlanta holds the first hearing on an Election Day lawsuit that seeks to have Kemp barred from having any further role in managing the election.\n\nThe Abrams campaign responded late Wednesday that Kemp\u2019s state office had not shared with the public or with the Abrams\u2019 campaign the detailed data behind his claims, instead asking Georgians to take him at his word.\n\nGeorgia's hotly contested and potentially historic governor's race may not be over yet, with Democrat Stacey Abrams and Republican Brian Kemp awaiting the final accounting of absentee and provisional ballots.

He needs to show proof.\u201d\n\nThe stand-off leaves open the possibility of litigation as Abrams\u2019 campaign has spent the day pushing for the continued counting of absentee, mail-in and provisional ballots and renewing its concerns that Kemp remains the chief elections officer supervising his own election, a race already marked by disputes over the voting process.\n\nWith reported votes exceeding 3.9 million \u2014 almost 95 percent of Georgia\u2019s 2016 presidential turnout \u2014 Kemp has just more than 50 percent.\n\nBefore the Kemp campaign declared victory Wednesday, Groh-Wargo estimated that about 15,000 votes separate Kemp from a runoff. She says at least that many outstanding absentee and mail-in ballots remained to be counted.\n\nKemp\u2019s spokeswoman in the secretary of state\u2019s office, Candice Broce, said that by Wednesday afternoon the number of uncounted absentee and mail-in ballots was less than 2,000 \u2014 with her boss still above the 50 percent threshold.\n\nBroce said about 22,000 provisional ballots have yet to be processed, according to a canvass of county officials across the state. Mahoney asserted that those numbers make it impossible for Abrams to pick up enough votes to deny Kemp an outright victory.\n\nIn 2016, with a slightly larger electorate, there were 16,739 provisional ballots. Of those, 7,592 were counted. State and campaign officials said they expected a much higher proportion to be counted this year.\n\nKemp\u2019s office has not released a county-by-county breakdown of provisional ballots, but Abrams\u2019 campaign said they believe they are concentrated in metro Atlanta counties where Abrams won a large share of the vote. Broce said Kemp\u2019s office is working on releasing more detailed information.\n\nIf a runoff is necessary, the second round would take place Dec. 4, extending one of the marquee races of the November midterms as Abrams tries to become the first black woman elected governor in American history while Kemp looks to maintain the GOP\u2019s domination in a state evolving into a genuine two-party battleground.\n\nEither way, Georgians are sure to see a new round of bitter recriminations over ballot access and voting rights that could leave some voters questioning the outcome of a contest both nominees have described as a \u201cbattle for the soul of our state.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is why we had a steady drumbeat for him to resign,\u201d Groh-Wargo said Wednesday, noting Abrams\u2019 and others\u2019 warnings about the potential for chaos in a tight election. \u201cHere we are,\u201d she said.\n\nKemp, 55, told his supporters early Wednesday that \u201cthere are votes left to count, but we have a very strong lead. ...

So far, turnout exceeds the 2014 governor\u2019s race by about 1.3 million votes.\n\nKemp\u2019s office, meanwhile, deflected the criticisms.\n\nBroce noted local elections authorities manage the voting process and ballot tabulation. \u201cCounties have not completed certification and we are still waiting for counties to provide their tabulations leading up to that certification,\u201d she said.\n\nA nonprofit group, Protect Democracy, filed a lawsuit Tuesday seeking to keep Kemp from being involved in counting votes, certifying results or any runoff or recount. Broce called it a \u201ctwelfth-hour stunt.\u201d\n\nState law gives counties until next Tuesday to complete vote counts and certify results to state elections officials. The statewide certification must follow by Nov. 20.\n\nThe indefinite extension in Georgia focuses a white-hot spotlight on a race that already has drawn massive investments of time, money and star power \u2014 from President Donald Trump and former President Barack Obama to media icon Oprah Winfrey.\n\nThe tight returns and potential runoff come after weeks of wrangling over Georgia\u2019s election system and Kemp\u2019s performance as its chief executive.

Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2018. (AP Photo/Juan Labreche)\n\nALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) \u2014 Democrats ran roughshod over Republican candidates in New Mexico\u2019s midterm election, taking control of the governor\u2019s office, flipping a key congressional seat along the U.S.-Mexico border, sweeping major statewide races and ensuring Democratic control of the state\u2019s top two courts.\n\nU.S. Rep. Michelle Lujan Grisham won the governor\u2019s race in a landslide to succeed termed-out Republican Gov. Susana Martinez amid frustration over the state\u2019s struggling public education system, entrenched poverty and a boom-and-bust economy closely tethered to the oil industry.\n\nBeyond New Mexico, Democrats appeared to gain unified control of the governor\u2019s office and both legislative chambers in Colorado, Illinois, Maine, Nevada and New York. Overall, Republicans still have more states with that trifecta of power.\n\nLujan Grisham defeated U.S. Rep. Steve Pearce, whose congressional district along Mexico\u2019s border ended up going to Democrat Xochitl Torres Small following vote counting that stretched into Wednesday evening. Torres Small vied for the seat with state Rep. Yvette Herrell, who embraced President Donald Trump\u2019s policies on immigration and won endorsements from conservative-leaning advocacy groups including the National Rifle Association.\n\nDemocrats also won elections for attorney general, secretary of state, state treasurer, state auditor and land commissioner, who oversees oil and renewable energy resources on vast state trust lands. They ousted a GOP Supreme Court justice and four appellate court judges.\n\nThe election positions Democrats to overhaul public education standards and funding, along with the state\u2019s approach to policies on climate change, gun control and the possible authorization of recreational marijuana.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Lujan Grisham vowed to push for new investments in solar and wind energy and has pledged to comply with a court order to help poor and minority students.\n\nState Senate majority leader Peter Wirth of Santa Fe said Lujan Grisham\u2019s victory places statewide minimum wage and teacher pay increases at the top of the legislative agenda next year, and could revive vetoed and dormant initiatives on subjects from campaign finance to abortion rights.\n\nHouse Speaker Brian Egolf said forecasts for a major budget surplus provide a \u201conce in a multiple-lifetimes opportunity to completely re-invent education.\u201d\n\nNew Mexico has shifted between Republican and Democratic governors for three decades even though Democrats dominate voter registration rolls. Democrats also have maintained majorities in both legislative chambers for most of the last century.\n\nHeavy currents of Roman Catholicism and a ranching ethos have helped Republican candidates win periodically over moderate or fickle Democrats on social issues or as a counterweight to the Legislature.\n\nPolitical consultant and former Democratic state senator Dede Feldman said results of legislative races indicate a progressive political shift in traditionally Republican areas of northeast Albuquerque.\n\n\u201cMost of these candidates ran on health care and education. They didn\u2019t really try to nationalize the race,\u201d Feldman said.\n\nDemocratic legislative candidates seized control of districts held by retiring GOP Minority Leader Nate Gentry and Republican stalwart Larry Larranaga, who served for more than two decades.\n\nAlso in Albuquerque, they ousted Republican Reps. Monica Youngblood, an ally of the governor who was recently convicted of drunken driving, and seven-term Rep. Jimmie Hall.\n\nOn the Navajo Nation in northwestern New Mexico, Democrat Anthony Allison of Fruitland ousted three-term Republican Sharon Clahchischilliage.\n\nAt the same time, Trump weighed on voters\u2019 minds Tuesday, according to a wide-ranging survey of the electorate conducted by The Associated Press.\n\nFor 30 percent of New Mexico voters, President Donald Trump was not a factor they considered while casting their votes. By comparison, more than one-quarter said a reason for their vote was to express support for Trump, and 43 percent said they voted to express opposition to Trump.\n\nA majority of New Mexico voters had negative views of Trump: About 60 percent said they disapprove of how he is handling his job as president, while 40 percent said they approve of Trump.\n\nDemocratic U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich won re-election to second term, as Republicans held onto their Senate majority with wins against incumbent Democrats in Indiana, North Dakota and Missouri.\n\nU.S. House races provided a historic win by Democrat Debra Haaland, one of the first Native American women elected to Congress. She will fill Lujan Grisham\u2019s seat. Five-term Democratic incumbent U.S. Rep.

They also tossed aside a tobacco tax hike that sparked major opposition spending from the tobacco industry.\n\nRepublican Dusty Johnson was elected South Dakota\u2019s next U.S. representative, not to mention Republicans keeping control of every statewide office.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at races of interest beyond the governor\u2019s race won by Republican Kristi Noem:\n\nBALLOT QUESTION CHANGES\n\nSouth Dakota, the first state to let citizens propose and pass laws way back in 1898, handed a win to those frustrated over money from outside the state\u2019s borders influencing voter measures. Citizens also backed the Legislature\u2019s plan to require constitutional amendments to stick to a single subject.\n\nThey were a pair of victories for House Speaker Mark Mickelson, who spearheaded both proposals after the 2016 election season brought 10 questions and millions of dollars from out-of-state groups.\n\nRepublican Dick Kelly, a 77-year-old former state lawmaker and local government official, voted for the outside funding ban, saying South Dakota has become a testing ground for people with a lot of money.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there should be that much influence by outside corporations or individuals with an agenda to come in and influence how we live in South Dakota,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cWe don\u2019t live the same way they live in California or New York, and I don\u2019t want to live that way. I want to live our way.\u201d\n\nDespite anger among some over lawmakers\u2019 repeal of a 2016 voter-approved ethics measure, voters panned a citizen-backed constitutional amendment that would have prevented the Legislature from changing initiatives \u2014 or the ballot question system \u2014 without a public vote. The amendment would have imposed stricter lobbying and campaign finance rules and created a new government ethics watchdog.\n\nVoters also decided to leave the current simple majority threshold required for constitutional amendments as is, rather than raise it to 55 percent.\n\nTOBACCO TAX FOR TECH SCHOOLS\n\nSmokers won\u2019t be paying to make state technical schools more affordable. Voters dispatched a ballot question to increase taxes on different tobacco products after the tobacco industry dumped millions into the state to oppose it.\n\nProceeds would have gone to lowering tuition and fees, offering scholarships and providing financial support for the state\u2019s four technical institutes. South Dakota hasn\u2019t raised its tobacco tax since 2006.\n\nAndy Middlen, a registered Democrat from Sioux Falls, cast an absentee vote Monday against it because he said he didn\u2019t believe the revenues raised would go where politicians said they would.\n\nU.S. HOUSE\n\nRepublican Dusty Johnson beat Democrat Tim Bjorkman to succeed Rep. Noem as the state\u2019s lone representative. Johnson was the favorite throughout the race. The former public utilities commissioner and past gubernatorial chief of staff ran an energetic and well-funded campaign as a traditional conservative. He said his top priority in Washington is getting a farm bill done.\n\n\u201cWe feel great,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThis was a job interview and tonight the people of South Dakota have hired us. I\u2019m not going to disappoint them.\u201d\n\nBjorkman said he gave South Dakotans an issue-based campaign free of rancor and harsh rhetoric that\u2019s all too common in politics.\n\nATTORNEY GENERAL\n\nRepublican lawyer and Army Reserve officer Jason Ravnsborg will be the latest in a long line of Republicans to be the state\u2019s chief lawyer and law enforcement officer. He overcame former U.S. Attorney Randy Seiler, who touted his prosecutorial experience.\n\nRavnsborg, a partner at a Yankton law firm, campaigned as the candidate favored by the law enforcement community. He\u2019s proposed expanding programs allowing lower-level prisoners to work and establishing a meth-specific prison and mental health facility in the central or western part of the state.\n\nThe high-profile office takes on the state\u2019s top legal cases and has served as a frequent springboard for gubernatorial hopefuls.\n\nOTHER STATEWIDE OFFICES & LEGISLATURE\n\nVoters also favored Republicans for a slew of other statewide offices, choosing Steve Barnett as secretary of state; Kristie Fiegen as public utilities commissioner; Rich Sattgast as state auditor; Josh Haeder as state treasurer; and Ryan Brunner as school and public lands commissioner. All 105 seats of the Legislature \u2014 70 in the House and 35 in the Senate \u2014 were also on the ballot.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "PARIS (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump\u2019s Russian business ties, Jared Kushner\u2019s relationship with the Saudi crown prince, Ivanka Trump\u2019s Chinese trademarks \u2014 all could come under new scrutiny by the Democrats when they take over the House of Representatives.\n\nWhile Trump retains broad power over national security and U.S. foreign policy, the midterm election result exposes him to congressional investigations that could reverberate beyond American borders.\n\nNow that they have taken control of the House from the Republicans, Democratic leaders of many committees will have subpoena powers enabling them to obtain documents, email and testimony.\n\nIf the White House doesn\u2019t block such requests in court, they could shed light on Trump\u2019s international business empire \u2014 and what role it\u2019s playing in U.S. relations with the world.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at what the election result might mean overseas:\n\nTRUMP AND RUSSIA\n\nFor Moscow, the Democratic victory means a probable reopening of the House investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election.\n\nThe Republican-led Intelligence Committee closed its probe into Russian meddling, saying it had found no evidence of collusion. Democrats argue that the Republicans ignored many key facts and witnesses.\n\nA congressional probe would be more public than special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s current investigation into Russian election interference \u2014 and wouldn\u2019t run the risk of being shut down by Trump.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin denies any involvement in Trump\u2019s election victory, and the Kremlin shrugged off concerns that a Democratic-controlled House would increase pressure on Russia.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019d be hard to make (the relationship) even worse,\u201d Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday.\n\nA renewed investigation could serve Kremlin interests by deepening division in America\u2019s political arena. What Putin would not favor would be investigations or sanctions that would further damage the well-connected Russian oligarchs believed to have links to Trump, or to have helped fund U.S. meddling efforts.\n\nRepublicans warn that more investigations could blow back against the Democrats for the 2020 U.S. election.\n\nPRESSURE ON THE SAUDIS\n\nThen there\u2019s Saudi Arabia, and the relationship between Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. The ties between the two men, who are said to communicate frequently, could come under increased scrutiny by Democrats.\n\nThe U.S. and Saudi Arabia have long been key allies, and Trump made the country his first stop abroad as president.\n\nBut the crown prince has lost supporters in Congress since the Oct. 2 killing of Saudi writer Jamal Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist and a critic of the crown prince, inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. The slaying was allegedly carried out by agents close to the prince.\n\nDemocrats could try to block major arms sales to Saudi Arabia and curtail U.S. support for Saudi Arabia\u2019s war in Yemen, which the prince launched as defense minister in 2015. The conflict has become widely unpopular with some members of Congress, and aid agencies say it has created the world\u2019s largest humanitarian catastrophe, with millions facing starvation amid a Saudi blockade of the Arab world\u2019s poorest country.\n\nThe U.S. assists the Saudi-led coalition with in-air refueling and intelligence on targets, and supplies the kingdom with fighter jets and bombs used in the war.\n\nTRADEMARKS IN CHINA\n\nDemocrats could also look into businesses in the Trump family\u2019s business empire \u2014 notably the 18 trademarks that China has granted in recent months to companies linked to Trump and his daughter Ivanka.\n\nSome question whether they represent a conflict of interest. China says it handles all trademark applications equally, but House committees could probe whether Beijing can exploit the Trump family\u2019s substantial intellectual property holdings in China to its political or diplomatic advantage.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much to the Trump administration that could be investigated, it\u2019s an unprecedented situation of major business entanglements around the world,\u201d said Dana Allin, senior fellow with the International Institute for Strategic Studies. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to rule out the idea that foreign policy decisions are not being kept separate from business interests.\u201d\n\nChina would not talk publicly about the U.S. election results. \u201cI don\u2019t want to comment on that, otherwise I will run the risk of being accused of interfering in their midterm election,\u201d foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said.\n\nWHAT WON\u2019T CHANGE\n\nTrump is still the one in charge and is not expected to change his America-first strategy, or stop running roughshod over erstwhile allies when it serves his interests.\n\nA Democratic House isn\u2019t going to put the U.S. back in the Iranian nuclear accord or the Paris climate agreement, and is unlikely to challenge Trump\u2019s protectionist line on trade.\n\n\u201cMany Democrats support the president\u2019s trade agenda,\u201d lamented Dieter Kempf, the head of the Federation of German Industries, the main business lobby group in Germany, a leading exporter. \u201cThe U.S. administration\u2019s confrontational course is and remains a danger to the world economy.\u201d\n\n___\n\nSullivan reported from New Delhi.

Mike Coffman blamed his defeat in Colorado on resentment toward President Donald Trump \u2014 but Trump is offering no sympathy and accepting no responsibility.\n\n\u201cToo bad, Mike,\u201d Trump said at a news conference Wednesday.\n\nCoffman had held the suburban Denver district for a decade, holding off a series of Democratic challengers as the district turned more liberal and diverse. But dislike of Trump and mistrust of the GOP\u2019s immigration policies proved too much this election, Coffman said after losing to first-time Democratic candidate Jason Crow on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIn this congressional district, in this race, it was a referendum on the president,\u201d Coffman said. \u201cIn the end, the waves were too big for this ship to stay afloat.\u201d\n\nTrump on Wednesday listed Coffman and seven other Republicans who lost after distancing themselves from the president \u2014 refusing what Trump called \u201cthe embrace.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey did very poorly,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure that I should be happy or sad, but I feel just fine about it.\u201d\n\nIn his concession speech, Coffman remarked on the shifting demographics of his district, where about 16 percent of residents were born outside the United States, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. He said spending time with diverse communities made him a better congressman and a better person.\n\nCoffman softened his position on immigration but said he could not overcome immigrants\u2019 mistrust of his party.\n\n\u201cThey believe that Republicans aren\u2019t simply against illegal immigration but they are against immigrants,\u201d he said.\n\nThree other incumbent Republican congressmen won re-election in Colorado, but the rest of the state was turning blue. Democrats held on to three congressional districts, including one now represented by Democrat Jared Polis. He was elected governor, replacing the term-limited Democrat John Hickenlooper.\n\nDemocrats won the attorney general, secretary of state and state treasurer\u2019s offices, all now held by Republicans. They also were on track to take over the state Senate from Republicans and expand their majority in the state House.\n\nCoffman\u2019s seat was one of more than two dozen that Democrats took from Republicans on Tuesday as the GOP lost control of the U.S. House. The telegenic Crow, an attorney, was the choice of national Democratic leaders to challenge the incumbent.\n\nBoth candidates are veterans: Crow is a former Army Ranger who served in Iran and Afghanistan, and Coffman is an Army and Marine veteran who served twice in Iraq.\n\nCrow campaigned on his differences with Coffman on gun control, health care and immigration.\n\nThe Democrat called for expanded background checks on gun purchases and restrictions on high-capacity ammunition magazines, proposals that resonated in a district where a gunman opened fire in a movie theater in 2012, killing 12 people. The district also abuts Columbine High School, where two students killed 13 people in 1999.\n\nCoffman opposed blanket gun restrictions but advocated for mental health and school safety measures.\n\nCrow assailed Coffman for voting for the GOP tax measure that revoked tax penalties for those who don\u2019t buy health insurance. It was a key provision of former President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law, which Crow defended as a first step toward his goal of universal health care.\n\nCoffman was booed at town halls last year for insisting that the health law be repealed, though he eventually voted against the GOP effort. He insisted that any replacement legislation guarantee coverage for people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nCoffman cited his longtime advocacy for veterans, his military service and his occasional bucking of the GOP to try to persuade voters to keep him.\n\nCrow depicted him as someone no longer able to act as a check on Trump and the Republican Party.\n\nVoter Darnell Driskell said Trump was a big factor in his decision to support Crow.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like the hate, you know what I\u2019m saying?\u201d Driskell said. \u201cI don\u2019t like the discomfort, I don\u2019t like what he stands for and what he does, what he represents.\u201d\n\nJeff Johnson, who voted for Coffman, said Trump didn\u2019t figure into his choice. Johnson said he considers himself a conservative, not a Republican, and he votes for candidates who support his values.\n\nAbout Trump, Johnson said, \u201cHe\u2019s egotistical and he runs his mouth off, but look at the economy. The economy is a hell of a lot better than it was two years ago.\u201d\n\nCoffman also lost the crucial fundraising battle. With the support of gun control groups, Crow raised more than $5 million, while Coffman collected $3.4 million. Big Republican donor groups pulled out of Coffman\u2019s campaign to focus on races they saw as more winnable, and he was outspent 3-to-1 on the airwaves.\n\nCrow made scant mention of Trump in his victory speech but noted \u201cthe dark and uncertain political moment we find ourselves in.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou sent a message that democracy is alive and well in America and that you will not be silenced,\u201d he told supporters.\n\nCrow was more conciliatory than jubilant, praising Coffman as a hard worker who served his country with honor.\n\n\u201cMike Coffman and his supporters are not our enemies. This is politics, not war, and I will never stop trying to find common ground wherever I can,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "BOISE, Idaho (AP) \u2014 Republican Sherri Ybarra has narrowly won a second term as Idaho\u2019s superintendent of public instruction, defeating Democratic challenger Cindy Wilson.\n\nThe race was too close to call for hours after Idaho\u2019s polls closed Tuesday night. But Ybarra\u2019s numbers pulled ahead as election officials continued to tally votes into the early hours Wednesday morning.\n\nThe position requires overseeing the state\u2019s public school system.

She focused her efforts as the state superintendent on supporting school districts by allowing them more control over the direction they took locally.\n\nWilson is a longtime teacher who has taught in rural and urban classrooms and served on Gov. C.L. \u201cButch\u201d Otter\u2019s education task force. Otter also appointed her to the Idaho Board of Correction, where she focused on improving education within the state\u2019s prison system.\n\nDuring their campaigns, both candidates said they would make boosting teacher pay a top priority. Idaho lawmakers approved the so-called \u201ccareer ladder\u201d program several years ago. The state is now four years into the five-year program that lawmakers created to raise teacher salaries in hopes of stemming the tide of educators leaving Idaho for more lucrative jobs in neighboring states. But both Ybarra and Wilson have said those efforts don\u2019t go far enough, and both pledged to make better pay for teachers among their top priorities.\n\nWilson also promised to foster civic education, make sure that children in rural schools have the same opportunities as their urban peers, and improve access to early childhood education. Ybarra said she would work to boost graduation rates and increase safety for students.\n\nIdaho remains far from its goal of having at least 60 percent of young adults obtaining a college degree or career training certificate, and the state ranks near the bottom nationally when it comes to per-student spending.", "Elissa Slotkin, Democratic candidate for Michigan's 8th Congressional District, speaks at an election night watch party in Clarkston, Mich., Wednesday, Nov. 7, 2018.

(AP) \u2014 Democrats retained control of three of Nevada\u2019s four U.S. House seats Tuesday night, holding onto two key seats left open by departing Democrats in the western battleground state.\n\nLike they did when they bucked the red wave that sent President Donald Trump to the White House two years ago, Democrats won all but the mostly rural 2nd District in northern Nevada where Republican Rep. Mark Amodei was easily re-elected to the seat he has held since 2011.\n\nIn southern Nevada, Democrat Susie Lee defeated Republican Danny Tarkanian in the 3rd District, and Democrat Steven Horsford beat Republican Cresent Hardy in a rematch of two former one-term congressmen in the 4th District.\n\nFirst District Democratic Rep. Dina Titus of Las Vegas cruised to victory over underfunded Republican challenger Joyce Bentley in the safest blue district in the Western swing state that Hillary Clinton carried in 2016.\n\nAmodei\u2019s Democratic challenger, Clinton Koble, picked up several labor endorsements but was outspent in the campaign by a 9-to-1 margin in the district no Democrat has ever won.\n\nLee, a 51-year-old Las Vegas philanthropist who raises money for education and disadvantaged women, raised $4.5 million and outspent Tarkanian by a 2-to-1 margin in the district made up of mostly suburban Las Vegas that Rep. Jacky Rosen left open enroute to knocking off Republican Sen. Dean Heller.\n\nHorsford held the 4th District where Democratic incumbent Rep. Ruben Kihuen decided against seeking re-election in the face of allegations of sexual misconduct\n\n\u201cThis victory does not belong to me. It belongs to the people,\u201d Horsford told his backers at a victory party in Las Vegas.

I\u2019m up for it if you\u2019re up for it.\u201d\n\nBoth districts were important nationally to Democrats who were headed toward taking control of the House and trying to build on the margin.\n\nTarkanian, the 56-year-old son of legendary UNLV basketball coach Jerry Tarkanian, conceded defeat in a speech to his supporters in Las Vegas.\n\nWhen asked if he would\u2019ve done anything differently, Tarkanian said: \u201cWe did everything we could with the resources that we had.\u201d He also did not specify if he would run again. He wants to go home and see his children.\n\nDanny Tarkanian lost to Rosen by fewer than 4,000 votes in 2016. Tarkanian launched a bid earlier this year to unseat Heller in the GOP Senate primary but backed off under pressure from President Donald Trump and others.\n\nLee lost in the 2016 primary to Democratic Rep. Ruben Kihuen (KEE-hune) in the neighboring 4th District.\n\nThe 68-year-old Titus is a longtime political science professor. She served a term in the neighboring 3rd District before first winning her current seat in 2012. Bentley is a former Las Vegas businesswoman and real estate agent who didn\u2019t report raising any money for her general election campaign.\n\nIn the 4th District, Horsford, 45, became the first African-American to represent Nevada in Congress in 2012 when the seat was created. Hardy, 61, a Republican, who defeated him in 2014 then lost to Kihuen in the last election.\n\nThe district stretches from north of Las Vegas through four rural counties in the western swing state that Democrat Hillary Clinton carried in her loss to President Donald Trump in 2016. It covers the southern and central portion of the state, including northern Clark County, stretching to the Utah line including White Pine County, also parts of Douglas and Lyon, all of Esmeralda, Lincoln, Mineral and Nye counties.\n\nIn 2016, Kihuen beat Cresent Hardy 48.5 to 44.5 percent in the district created in 2010.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press journalist Trey Arline in Las Vegas contributed to this report.", "", "Voters head to the polls at the Enterprise Library, Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2018, in Las Vegas. (AP Photo/Joe Buglewicz)\n\nLAS VEGAS (AP) \u2014 Nevada voters answered a nearly $100 million question on Tuesday with a resounding vote against amending the state constitution to break up a monopoly held by the state\u2019s dominant electric utility.\n\nThe fight over Question 3 pitted NV Energy against two of its big energy customers, casino company Las Vegas Sands and data storage firm Switch, and became the most expensive ballot measure in state history \u2014 drawing more spending even than the races for U.S. Senate and Nevada governor.\n\nNearly three-fourths of voters had given the measure initial approval in 2016. But as a constitutional amendment, it required a second vote to become law.\n\nDave Chase, manager of the Yes on 3, campaign insisted late Tuesday that competition would drive prices down and increase renewable energy choices. He promised to continue the fight.\n\n\u201cThe fact is, NV Energy spent more money opposing Question 3 than anyone has ever spent in the history of Nevada politics,\u201d he said.\n\nVoters also decided Tuesday to enshrine victim rights in the state constitution, repealed taxes on feminine hygiene products and medical equipment, provided for automatic voter registration at the state motor vehicles department and agreed to speed the pace and raise the requirement for electricity generated from renewable energy sources.\n\nBackers of the energy choice initiative, led by Sands and Switch, spent nearly $33 million telling voters that companies and consumers should not be forced to buy electricity from one provider and that market forces and competition would drive prices down.\n\nLV Sands, Switch and some other large corporations want to quit NV Energy and buy electricity elsewhere. But they face stiff exit penalties that would compensate smaller customers whose rates could be affected.\n\nNV Energy, which faced the loss of its exclusive franchise, underwrote much of the $63.4 million spent against Question 3. Opponents characterized the initiative as a bid for unpredictable deregulation that would drive prices up.\n\nNV Energy promised to invest billions of dollars in solar energy production if the measure failed, and to partner with six solar power development firms around the state to buy enough renewable energy to supply more than 600,000 homes.\n\nThe contest also was framed as a battle between billionaires. Investor Warren Buffett\u2019s company, Berkshire Hathaway Energy, owns NV Energy while casino mogul Sheldon Adelson heads Las Vegas Sands, owner of the Venetian and Palazzo resorts on the Las Vegas Strip.\n\nThe victim rights measure was backed by California billionaire semiconductor company co-founder Henry Nicholas in memory of his slain sister, Marsalee \u201cMarsy\u201d Nicholas, who was killed by her ex-boyfriend in 1983. It was approved by the state Legislature in 2015 and 2017, but needed voter approval as a constitutional amendment.\n\nIt expands the definition of a victim and lists 16 rights including privacy, protection from a defendant, refusal of interview or deposition requests without a court order, notice of court and parole hearings and \u201cfull and timely restitution.\u201d\n\nThe so-called \u201cpink tax\u201d repeal for feminine hygiene products, Question 2, needed voter approval as a tax law.\n\nThe medical equipment tax, Question 4, was framed as a patient tax relief initiative. It needed statewide approval as a constitutional amendment a second time, after passing with 72 percent of the vote in 2016.\n\nThe automatic voter registration issue, Question 5, amends state law to change what amounted to an opt-in system at the state Department of Motor Vehicles to an opt-out rule. That will require a person to check a box to decline voter registration.\n\nThe other energy question on the ballot, Question 6, won its first statewide vote. It will need voter approval again in 2020 as a constitutional proposal to raise the minimum amount of power that electric utilities generate or acquire from solar, wind or geothermal sources to 50 percent in 2030.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "", "", "FILE - In this June 28, 2018 file photo, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker attends an event to make remarks at a Foxconn facility in Mt. Pleasant, Wis. Walker faces Democrat Tony Evers in his re-election bid in the Nov. 6 election. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File)\n\nMADISON, Wis. (AP) \u2014 Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, beloved by Republicans for pushing through a conservative revolution but so reviled by liberals that they tried to recall him from office, warned for months that he was at risk of being overwhelmed by Democratic anger.\n\nHe was right.\n\nThe tide that swept him out Tuesday stalled a political career that radically transformed the purple state and helped bring about President Donald Trump\u2019s narrow victory there in 2016. For nearly eight years, Walker delighted conservatives and frustrated liberal opponents who could never figure out the right recipe to knock him off. At one point, he was seen as a potential presidential front-runner.\n\nTrump\u2019s entrance into the 2016 race forced Walker out. And distaste over Trump\u2019s first two years as president contributed to depressed Republican turnout, and massive Democratic votes, in key parts of Wisconsin, leading to Walker\u2019s narrow 31,000-vote loss to state education chief Tony Evers.\n\nRepublicans who worked with Walker for years as he rose from the state Assembly to Milwaukee County executive and then governor in 2010 were in shock, still trying to process the loss. It was Walker\u2019s first defeat since 1990, at the age of 22. He won his first race for state Assembly in 2003 and never lost another election until Tuesday.\n\nWalker conceded the race Wednesday. Evers\u2019 margin of victory stood just above the 1 percentage point threshold that would allow Walker to seek a recount.\n\nAs governor, Walker transformed the state Republican Party into a powerful get-out-the vote machine that consolidated GOP power. He raked in donations from across the country while building his own personal brand.\n\nHe was part of the \u201cCheesehead Revolution\u201d that included Rep. Paul Ryan\u2019s rise to House speaker and Reince Priebus\u2019 leadership of the Republican National Committee before briefly working as Trump\u2019s chief of staff.\n\n\u201cAs much as the left hates Scott Walker and showed it with passion on election night, Republicans across the state love Scott Walker,\u201d said Brandon Scholz, a Walker ally and former state GOP director. \u201cHe\u2019s been a leader. He\u2019s been a friend. He\u2019s been a champion. He has crisscrossed the state for every event he could possibly be at.\u201d\n\nWalker\u2019s longtime opponents, including a core group who sang protest songs daily in the rotunda of the state Capitol, could barely contain their glee. They danced, hugged, cried and beat on drums for an hour Wednesday, holding signs that said things like \u201cThere is a god.\u201d\n\nKeith Steffen joined with dozens others to sing \u201cThis Land is Your Land\u201d and other songs with lyrics altered to target Walker.\n\n\u201cI just was hoping it would have come a lot sooner,\u201d he said.\n\nWalker blew into office as part of a red wave in the 2010 election, with Republicans capturing control of the state Legislature at the same time. Together they enacted a host of conservative reforms, chiefly taking away nearly all collective bargaining power from teachers and other public workers as part of a fight in 2011 that put Wisconsin at the forefront of a new war over union rights.\n\nThat battle that drew protests as large as 100,000 people spurred the 2012 recall, which Walker won. It raised his national profile and laid the groundwork for his presidential bid. Along the way, Walker signed laws making Wisconsin a right-to-work state, enacting a 20-week abortion ban, passing a concealed-carry law and scaling back a host of environmental regulations that businesses opposed.\n\nEvers seemed like an unlikely hero for liberal Walker opponents. Casting himself as a moderate, the 67-year-old cancer survivor faced criticism that he was too old and too boring to take down the left\u2019s biggest target. But Evers embraced his milquetoast personality straight out of a 1950s family sitcom, routinely peppering his comments with words like \u201cjeepers\u201d and \u201choly mackerel.\u201d He argued that more civility and less hostility was exactly what voters wanted in the age of Trump.\n\nThe former teacher didn\u2019t promise a complete repeal of everything Walker enacted. Instead, he focused on protecting insurance guarantees for people with pre-existing health conditions, increasing spending on education and improving the state\u2019s roads.\n\nBut doing anything with a Republican-controlled Legislature that enacted Walker\u2019s agenda will be difficult, if not impossible.\n\nEvers\u2019 supporters know he faces a tough road ahead. But to people such as 81-year-old Dave Knutzen, who is among those who have sung every day in the Capitol for more than seven years, all that matters is that Walker is gone.\n\n\u201cIt took a long time,\u201d Knutzen said. \u201cI kind of gave up after a while.\u201d\n\nKnutzen attributed Walker\u2019s defeat to voter anger with Trump.\n\n\u201cI think he energized a whole bunch of people, including women and young people,\u201d Knutzen said of the president. \u201cWe got the turnout we needed.\u201d\n\nWalker, the son of a Baptist preacher who died in October, returned to his faith in the closing days of the race. On Election Day, he tweeted a Bible verse, \u201cI have learned to be content whatever the circumstances.\u201d And the day after his loss, he tweeted a psalm, \u201cThis is the day that the Lord has made; let us rejoice and be glad in it.\u201d\n\nOne of Walker\u2019s most outspoken liberal opponents, Jeff Simpson, tweeted in response: \u201cAMEN ... we are rejoicing.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Scott Bauer on Twitter: https://twitter.com/sbauerAP\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics .", "", "Democrat Jared Polis walks onto the stage with running mate Dianne Primavera upon defeating Republican Walker Stapleton in the race for Colorado governor, during the Democratic watch party in Denver on Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2018.

Democrats also captured the GOP-held positions of secretary of state, attorney general and state treasurer.\n\nNational LGBTQ advocates hailed Polis becoming the first openly gay man elected governor in the United States. But issues of sexual preference or gender never became a prominent topic in Polis\u2019 campaign against Republican state Treasurer Walker Stapleton \u2014 despite Colorado\u2019s dark past and continuing struggles on the issue.\n\nColorado was dubbed a \u201chate state\u201d when voters in 1992 approved a ban on laws that protected gays from discrimination. The U.S. Supreme Court later struck it down as unconstitutional. After years of struggle, civil unions were legalized in 2013, and gay marriage in 2014.\n\nThis year, the U.S. Supreme Court partially upheld the arguments of a Colorado baker who refused to make a wedding cake for a gay couple on religious grounds. Jack Phillips, owner of the Masterpiece Cakeshop, has sued the state again for opposing his refusal to bake a cake celebrating a gender transition.\n\nOn social media, some Colorado residents discussed voting for Polis without knowing he is gay with a partner and two children.\n\n\u201cWe went from a state where our elected officials struggled to provide even basic rights to same-sex couples to a state where a gay man ran for governor and his sexual orientation wasn\u2019t discussed as a political liability,\u201d The Denver Post wrote in an editorial late Tuesday.\n\nKayla DeShon, an independent voter from the south Denver suburb of Highlands Ranch, joyfully agreed. The 29-year-old said she voted for Polis because of his commitment to universal health care and defense of insurance coverage of pre-existing conditions. She has an autistic child.\n\n\u201cI did not know he is gay. I found out afterward \u2014 it was an added bonus,\u201d DeShon said. \u201cHealth care and education are important to me as a mom. And so is climate change. So I made an educated decision.\n\n\u201cAnd I do think that it doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re moving toward a state of equality where people and politicians don\u2019t have to state their sexual preference or their gender.\u201d\n\nMore than 2.4 million Colorado residents voted in an election whose top themes included health care policy and President Donald Trump. One in four residents are covered by Medicaid, but those in vast areas of rural Colorado pay some of the nation\u2019s highest health insurance premiums and have only one provider.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers pledged to work closely with Polis on the issue.

Sullivan\u2019s son, Alex, was killed by a gunman as he celebrated his 27th birthday in an Aurora movie theater in 2012.

(Briana Sanchez/The Argus Leader via AP, File)\n\nSIOUX FALLS, S.D. (AP) \u2014 Republican Rep. Kristi Noem called it \u201cpretty humbling\u201d to be elected South Dakota\u2019s first female governor after stopping a surprisingly strong challenge Tuesday from Democrat Billie Sutton that put his party close to an office they haven\u2019t held for decades.\n\nBut Noem didn\u2019t make the milestone a big deal during her campaign, instead playing up her farming and ranching background and congressional achievements \u2014 including passing the GOP\u2019s federal tax cuts \u2014 to win the historic victory. Meanwhile, Sutton sought voters across parties, casting himself as a moderate with pro-gun and anti-abortion views to push Noem until the end.\n\n\u201cI feel relieved,\u201d Noem told The Associated Press early Wednesday. \u201cWe worked hard and shared my vision for the state, and I\u2019m just very grateful that the people of South Dakota put their trust in me to be their next governor.\u201d\n\nA four-term congresswoman, Noem will trade Washington for tiny Pierre once she\u2019s sworn into office in 2019. She replaces Republican Gov. Dennis Daugaard, who couldn\u2019t run again because of term limits.\n\nSutton\u2019s campaign gave Democrats rare hope. His compelling life story \u2014 former rodeo cowboy who turned to politics after a paralyzing injury \u2014 brought him added interest.\n\nA self-described \u201cpro-life and pro-Second Amendment\u201d moderate, Sutton portrayed himself as an anti-corruption crusader who would buck the status quo after financial misconduct scandals that grabbed South Dakota headlines.\n\nNoem reminded voters that Sutton is a Democrat and tied him to 2016 Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. She also asserted \u2014 over Sutton\u2019s denials \u2014 that he backed a state income tax for South Dakota, one of seven states without it.\n\nNoem said her experience helped her win, and now her priorities are focusing on education, filling workforce needs and dealing with public safety issues. Her lieutenant governor, state Rep. Larry Rhoden, told voters in one TV ad that Noem\u2019s life experiences have prepared her to be an extremely effective governor.\n\nShe has promised to protect state residents from tax increases and more government regulations, improve state transparency and fight federal government intrusion.\n\nRamona Rupp, a Republican from Sioux Falls, said she supported Noem based on the congresswoman\u2019s experience and because she seems like a hard worker. The 64-year-old retiree said she hopes Noem keeps her promise not to raise taxes.\n\n\u201cI just feel it\u2019s time to get more females involved, too,\u201d said Rupp, noting, though, that her vote is based on the best candidate, not on gender. \u201cThere\u2019s always room for change, and, you know, she\u2019s proven herself over and over.\u201d\n\nNoem, who has roots in ranching and farming, brought major strengths to the race: a nearly 100,000-voter GOP advantage, experience running statewide campaigns and support from the state\u2019s dominant political party and its top officials. She also significantly outraised and outspent Sutton.\n\nNoem started the favorite and ended the winner. An October poll showed the race as neck-and-neck, but Noem had gained ground in a survey released just days before the election. She claimed the momentum and encouraged people to vote.\n\nSutton said he wished Noem well after her victory and encouraged her to reach across the aisle to find common ground. He said his team \u201cfought a heck of a fight,\u201d but they were always underdogs. Sutton said he hopes Noem focuses on government transparency, overhauling campaign finance rules and tamping down the cost of higher education.\n\nNoem\u2019s transparency plan includes having state and local government board meetings livestreamed, creating a property tax toolkit that would allow taxpayers to see where their money goes and supporting a reporter shield law.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "President and CEO of Formula 1 Chase Carey, left, Hanoi Mayor Nguyen Duc Chung, second from left and two other officials watch the Hanoi F1 circuit design on the screen in Hanoi, Vietnam, Wednesday, Nov. 7, 2018.

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A polarized nation is now more deeply divided.\n\nIn a single flurry of elections Tuesday, Democrats took control of the House of Representatives. Republicans held their grip on the Senate. And the breach that divides Americans \u2014 urban from rural, white from black, conservative from liberal \u2014 stretched ever wider.\n\nThe midterm results highlight a political sorting in America that has accelerated during Donald Trump\u2019s presidency. Race, class and geography separate the parties as much as ideology, with the president as the dividing line.\n\nDemocrats surged to their new House majority by picking up seats in more affluent and highly educated suburban districts. Voters in the suburbs skewed toward Democrats by a nearly 10-percentage-point margin, according to AP VoteCast, the national survey of the electorate.\n\nCollege-educated women, in particular, helped carry Democratic candidates, motivated in part by a deep opposition to Trump\u2019s nationalist agenda and racially charged rhetoric.\n\n\u201cThis gender gap has been increasing cycle after cycle,\u201d said Stephanie Schriock, the president of Emily\u2019s List, a group backing Democratic female candidates. \u201cParticularly under this Trump administration, that\u2019s going to continue moving forward.\u201d\n\nDemocrats have won control of the House, significantly changing the balance of power in Washington. However, a strong Republican showing in midterm Senate races means it was far from a winning night for the Democrats. (Nov. 7)\n\nBut the Democratic gains were limited to the House. The Senate landscape told a different story, of a segment of the country that looked far different.\n\nRepublicans increased their Senate majority with support from the same coalition of voters that propelled Trump to the presidency two years ago: whites without college degrees \u2014 particularly men \u2014 in more conservative, rural states. GOP candidates defeated Democratic incumbents in North Dakota, Indiana and Missouri.\n\nThe GOP victories appeared to reinforce the politics behind Trump\u2019s closing message \u2014 a mix of dark, inaccurate warning about an \u201cinvasion\u201d of immigrants streaming across the U.S. border. The fear, it seems, does motivate Republicans. And few can summon that anxiety like Trump.\n\n\u201cHe is absolutely the only Republican who could generate the kind of enthusiasm in the base that was necessary to compete in a really difficult midterm,\u201d said Josh Holmes, a longtime political adviser to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\nWith each party taking control of one chamber of Congress, and another presidential election fast approaching, these divisions will be a defining feature of American politics through 2020. Each party now has a template for success in the Trump era and will spend the next two years trying to replicate it.\n\nThe midterm results hold some long-term promise for Democrats, a party that was banished to the political hinterlands in 2016.\n\nSome Democratic-leaning states that flipped for Trump two years ago \u2014 Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania \u2014 swung back to the left Tuesday, electing Democrats in key Senate and governors\u2019 races. That suggests Trump\u2019s victories in the Midwestern battlegrounds could have been an anomaly, not a permanent realignment.\n\nThe president can take solace, however, in the fact that Republicans were victorious in Ohio and Florida, two of the most important political battlegrounds. In Florida, Trump acolyte Ron DeSantis defeated Democrat Andrew Gillum, the young, black mayor of Tallahassee who had appeared poised to become a national party star.\n\nDemographics remain a looming problem for Republicans in a nation that continues to grow more diverse. Unless the GOP can boost its appeal with minorities, as well as younger Americans, the party may simply run out of voters to carry its candidates to victory.\n\nBut what\u2019s good for the Republican Party long-term is not necessarily Trump\u2019s focus.\n\nThe president spent little time during this election year trying to win over his critics or bring highly educated voters back into the Republican fold. He doubled down on the issues that helped him win in 2016, particularly hardline immigration policies.\n\nBut those same political maneuvers cost Republicans in the House, where the fight for control played out in moderate, suburban districts Trump lost in 2016. A strong economy and a pro-business tax plan that Republicans believed would appeal to the wealthier, better educated voters in these areas were overshadowed by the president\u2019s vitriol.\n\nTrump now faces a choice as he plunges into his own re-election campaign. He can moderate his policies and his tactics and try to appeal to those voters who abandoned the GOP this year. Or he may conclude that the same coalition of voters that carried him to the White House two years ago will show up in large enough numbers when his name is on the ballot.\n\n__\n\nAP polling reporter Hannah Fingerhut contributed to this report.\n\n__\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: Julie Pace has covered the White House and politics for the AP since 2007.

(AP Photo/Hannah Foslien)\n\nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 Democrats in Minnesota collected most of the victories they were expected to in Tuesday\u2019s election, plus some they weren\u2019t.\n\nTim Walz and Tina Smith won the governor and Senate races, confirming polls that had them leading most of the way. And Angie Craig and Dean Phillips knocked off Republican incumbents to flip two House seats, helping their party grab control of the chamber.\n\nIn a race that was up in the air right up to election day, Keith Ellison was elected attorney general after three months dogged by an allegation that he abused his former girlfriend.\n\nIn perhaps the biggest surprise of the midterm, Democrats rode strong turnout to overcome an 11-seat deficit and grab control of the state House.\n\nA bright spot for the GOP was a victory in a special election for a single state Senate seat that prevented Democrats from taking that chamber.\n\nA rundown:\n\nU.S. HOUSE\n\nFour Minnesota congressional races attracted national attention, and millions of outside dollars, because of their potential to affect the balance of power in the House.\n\nIn the suburban 3rd District, Democratic businessman Dean Phillips defeated Republican Rep. Erik Paulsen. Phillips formerly ran his family\u2019s liquor company and is a grandson of the late advice columnist Abigail Van Buren, better known as Dear Abby. In the suburban/rural 2nd, Democratic former medical device company executive Angie Craig unseated Republican Rep. Jason Lewis, who narrowly beat her in 2016.\n\nIn northeastern Minnesota\u2019s 8th District, Pete Stauber, a St. Louis County commissioner and retired Duluth police officer, defeated former state representative Joe Radinovich in a race that was seen as Republicans\u2019 best chance nationwide of picking up a Democratic seat. The seat opened up with Rep. Rick Nolan\u2019s retirement.\n\nIn southern Minnesota\u2019s 1st District, Republican Jim Hagedorn, a former Treasury Department official and son of a former congressman, was locked in a tight race against Democratic Iraq War veteran Dan Feehan, who was acting assistant secretary of defense for readiness in the Obama administration. The seat opened up when Walz ran for governor.\n\nHistory was made in the solidly Democratic 5th District, where state Rep. Ilhan Omar became the first Somali-American \u2014 and one of the first two Muslim women \u2014 elected to Congress. Omar defeated Republican Jennifer Zielinski in the Minneapolis-area district.\n\nU.S. SENATE\n\nGov. Mark Dayton appointed Smith, his lieutenant governor and former top aide, to fill the seat that Franken resigned under pressure in December amid a growing sexual misconduct scandal. She defeated Housley for the right to complete rest of Franken\u2019s term, which runs through 2020.\n\nIn Minnesota\u2019s other U.S. Senate race, Democrat Amy Klobuchar easily captured a third term over little-known state Rep. Jim Newberger.\n\nLEGISLATURE\n\nRepublican Speaker Kurt Daudt conceded that his party would lose the majority in the Minnesota House that it has held since 2015. The final margin of Democrats\u2019 majority was unclear as votes were still being tallied early Wednesday. Democrats needed to flip 11 seats to take control of the chamber.\n\nBut Republicans kept control of the state Senate in a special election in a rural St. Cloud-area district. GOP Sen. Michelle Fischbach resigned the seat earlier this year to be sworn in as lieutenant governor, leaving the Senate deadlocked at 33-33. Minnesota\u2019s 66 remaining Senate districts aren\u2019t on the ballot until 2020.\n\nGOP Rep. Jeff Howe, who has represented half of the district since 2013, defeated former Sartell mayor and county commissioner Joe Perske. With two weeks to go, more than $1 million of mailers and political spending poured into the race.\n\nATTORNEY GENERAL\n\nEllison\u2019s victory over Republican Doug Wardlow, who was a virtual unknown, preserves a Democratic lock on the attorney general\u2019s office that dates back to the 1970 election. The abuse allegation had put the office in play for the first time in half a century.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Democrats didn\u2019t catch a blue wave. But they managed the next best thing: Divided government in the Trump era.\n\nHouse Democrats won back the majority for the first time since the 2010 elections. Helped by President Donald Trump, Republicans captured Senate seats in Indiana, Missouri and North Dakota to maintain a narrow advantage.\n\nIn the Great Lakes region, Democrats secured governors\u2019 offices in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, complicating the president\u2019s re-election campaign in an area that propelled him to victory in 2016. But Trump helped Republicans claim governors\u2019 seats in Ohio and in Florida, where his hand-picked choice, Ron DeSantis, edged Andrew Gillum in the state\u2019s high-profile governors\u2019 race.\n\nTuesday\u2019s midterm elections offered something for everyone. Democrats will control the House, but Trump will point to GOP success in the Senate as proof that he defied the odds and avoided the type of midterm wipeout that afflicted his predecessor, former President Barack Obama.\n\nYet Trump\u2019s administration will now face intense scrutiny from House Democrats and a slew of subpoenas and document requests of his Cabinet \u2014 not to mention a renewed push for the president\u2019s tax returns. And as special counsel Robert Mueller presses forward with the Russia investigation, the most liberal members of the Democratic caucus are expected to sound the alarm for the president\u2019s impeachment.\n\nSome takeaways from Tuesday\u2019s election:\n\n___\n\nPOLITICAL POLARIZATION\n\nDemocrats posted gains in House seats representing the nation\u2019s suburbs, with many college-educated women turned off by Trump\u2019s first two years. Republicans strengthened their grip on the country\u2019s rural and exurban areas, helping them defeat red-state Senate Democrats. The results could lead to more standoffs in Congress \u2014 there\u2019s already the possibility of a partial federal government shutdown in December over spending for Trump\u2019s signature border wall. And the outcome will produce fewer moderate lawmakers who can straddle the divide. West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, a centrist Democrat, won re-election, but he will be the exception, not the norm.\n\n___\n\nSTAR DESTROYER\n\nTrump allies dealt major blows to three of the Democrats\u2019 breakout stars of the 2018 cycle. Democrat Beto O\u2019Rourke lost to Sen. Ted Cruz in Texas. Gillum lost his bid to become Florida\u2019s first black governor to DeSantis, whose public support from Trump propelled the former congressman to the top of the primary field. And Stacey Abrams\u2019 campaign to become Georgia\u2019s governor \u2014 and the nation\u2019s first-ever black female governor \u2014 was trailing early Wednesday against Brian Kemp, who was also helped along by a critical Trump endorsement. Abrams declined to concede the race, pointing to votes that still needed to be counted and suggesting a likely runoff.\n\n___\n\n2020 IMPLICATIONS\n\nTrump has taunted the potential 2020 Democratic field as lacking any talent or the ability to give him a serious challenge. He will soon find out. Three potential candidates, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Kirsten Gillibrand, all won re-election to the Senate. Former Vice President Joe Biden and Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey were among the most sought-after surrogates during the fall campaign. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s star power and massive fundraising haul generated chatter as a possible 2020 candidate \u2014 win or lose \u2014 but he said in the final days he wouldn\u2019t run in 2020. Despite Trump\u2019s dismissive approach, he will enter his re-election as an incumbent who lost the popular vote in 2016 and staring down key states \u2014 Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin \u2014 now under Democratic control.\n\n___\n\nREBUILDING THE BLUE WALL?\n\nAfter Trump won several Midwest states that had long been in the Democratic column, the party had hoped to rebuild its Midwest \u201cblue wall.\u201d Democrats made some progress, but just like the nature of the election, it was a split decision. Democrats picked up the governors\u2019 offices in Michigan and Wisconsin and kept control in Pennsylvania. But Republicans won the governors\u2019 races in Iowa and Ohio, giving Trump allies in two key presidential swing states. Remember, no Republican candidate for the presidency has ever won the election without winning Ohio.\n\n___\n\nWOMEN RULE\n\nAfter Hillary Clinton\u2019s defeat, more women than ever before won major-party primaries for governor, the Senate and the House this year. Tuesday\u2019s election produced a record number of women in the House and opened the door for women to hold state offices around the country. Democratic women like Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, Cindy Axne of Iowa and Haley Stevens of Michigan helped the party flip Republican-held seats in the House. Republican Marsha Blackburn won an open Senate seat in Tennessee and the Midwest elected two female governors: Kim Reynolds of Iowa, a Republican who won a full term after succeeding Terry Branstad, Trump\u2019s ambassador to China, and Laura Kelly of Kansas, a Democrat who defeated Republican Kris Kobach. Women voted considerably more in favor of their congressional Democratic candidate \u2014 with fewer than 4 in 10 voting for the Republican, according to VoteCast, a nationwide survey conducted for The Associated Press by NORC at the University of Chicago.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP THE CLOSER\n\nTrump has long prided himself on the ability of his massive rallies to generate voter turnout and enthusiasm \u2014 and it paid off for him in the final days. The president staged rallies in five states \u2014 Georgia, Tennessee, Ohio, Indiana and Missouri \u2014 on the final two days of the campaign, helping his cause. In Georgia, Kemp was leading Abrams in the governor\u2019s race but no winner had been declared. Tennessee Rep. Marsha Blackburn won an open Senate seat. Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine, a former senator, won the race for governor. In Indiana, businessman Mike Braun ousted Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly. And Josh Hawley prevailed over Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill, giving Republicans another Senate pickup.\n\n___\n\nFOR HISTORY\n\nThe night served as witness to a number of history-making breakthroughs \u2014 steps that will help make Congress younger and more diverse. In New York, 29-year-old Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez became the youngest woman elected to Congress. Democrats Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan will be the first Muslim women to serve in Congress. Kristi Noem will become the first woman from South Dakota to serve as her state\u2019s governor. The House will have two Native American women for the first time: New Mexico\u2019s Deb Haaland and Kansas\u2019 Sharice Davids, who will also become her state\u2019s first openly LGBT candidate to hold major office.

The two-term Republican incumbent had held off conceding because the race was so close, but his campaign decided Wednesday there were not enough votes in play to change the outcome.\n\nBased on unofficial results, Evers won by about 31,000 votes.\n\nWalker says in a statement that he offered the full support of his staff and Cabinet to Evers as he begins the transition.\n\nWalker had expressed concern about 2,000 absentee ballots in Milwaukee that had been reconstructed due to errors or damage. But Walker\u2019s campaign says in a statement that it determined there weren\u2019t enough votes in question to change the outcome of the race.\n\nEvers is slated to be sworn into office Jan. 7.\n\n___\n\n10:20 a.m.\n\nThe city of Milwaukee says its handling of absentee ballots on election night was routine, even as Gov. Scott Walker has raised questions about their possible effect on the governor\u2019s race.\n\nThe city says it reconstructed about 2,000 ballots due to damage or other errors. It says the process is routine and witnessed by representatives of both political parties, election workers and the public.\n\nWalker\u2019s campaign has pointed to the damaged ballots as one of the reasons why he has not conceded to Democrat Tony Evers. Evers defeated Walker by about 31,000 votes, based on unofficial results. That\u2019s close to the margin for a recount.\n\nMilwaukee\u2019s Election Commission says in a statement Wednesday that the process of reconstructing a ballot is \u201centirely transparent, dictated by state law and was followed by the City of Milwaukee.\u201d\n\nExamples of problems that would lead to reconstruction include voter error, such as marking X\u2019s on ballots or using pencil, and damage that can occur during the mail processing.\n\nThe city counted about 47,000 absentee ballots.\n\n___\n\n10:15 a.m.\n\nDemocrats are crying foul after Republicans held their majorities in both legislative chambers in Tuesday\u2019s elections, insisting the GOP wins are more evidence the party drew district boundaries unfairly.\n\nThe GOP went into Election Day with a 64-35 majority in the Assembly and an 18-15 Senate advantage. Unofficial election results show not a single Republican legislative incumbent lost, even though Democrats appear to have won at least three statewide offices, including governor.\n\nDemocrats filed a federal lawsuit three years ago arguing Republicans unconstitutionally re-drew legislative district boundaries in 2011 to consolidate power.\n\nLawsuit organizer Sachin Chheda says Tuesday\u2019s results are further evidence that the districts are rigged for Republicans and will bolster Democrats\u2019 case in court.\n\n___\n\n9:40 a.m.\n\nTurnout in Wisconsin\u2019s midterm election is the highest on record, topping out at over 57 percent.\n\nThe hard-fought race for governor drove people to vote Tuesday, with the race for U.S. Senate close behind.\n\nBased on unofficial totals, nearly 2.7 million people cast ballots. That comes to 57.2 percent of the voting-age population.\n\nDemocrat Tony Evers narrowly defeated Republican incumbent Gov. Scott Walker, thanks largely to massive turnout in Democratic strongholds of Dane and Milwaukee counties. Walker also underperformed in key Republican areas, like the suburban Milwaukee counties.\n\nWalker lost by just over 1 percentage point of the vote, based on unofficial results.\n\n___\n\n9:35 a.m.\n\nDemocrat Josh Kaul is declaring himself Wisconsin\u2019s next attorney general even though his race with Republican incumbent Brad Schimel remains too close to call.\n\nUnofficial results Wednesday morning showed Kaul leading by almost 23,000 votes, or less than 1 percentage point, with the unofficial vote nearly complete.\n\nSchimel said in a statement that it \u201cappears\u201d Kaul has won, but he will wait for the official canvass.\n\nKaul called himself the attorney general in a brief appearance outside the Dane County courthouse Wednesday morning. He thanked his family and supporters and promised to work to expand Medicare coverage and withdraw the state from a federal lawsuit challenging the Affordable Care Act.\n\n___\n\n9:15 a.m.\n\nGov.

While Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch vowed there would be a recount, and his campaign spokesman raised concerns about damaged ballots, Walker has not been heard from.\n\nBut shortly before 9 a.m. Wednesday, Walker tweeted the Psalm \u201cThis is the day that the Lord has made; let us rejoice and be glad in it.\u201d\n\nWalker\u2019s father, Llew Walker, was a Baptist preacher who died in October.\n\nUnofficial results show that Evers defeated Walker by just over 1 percentage point. Only candidates who lose by less than a point can request a recount.\n\nEvers declared victory early Wednesday morning.\n\n___\n\n9:06 a.m.\n\nWisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel says it \u201cappears\u201d that Democrat Josh Kaul has won their race, but Schimel will wait until all votes are counted.\n\nSchimel said in a statement Wednesday morning that he had spoken with Kaul and that if the margin doesn\u2019t substantially change, he vowed to help with a smooth transition.\n\nWith the unofficial vote nearly complete, Kaul led by almost 23,000 votes, or less than 1 percentage point. Losing candidates can request recounts if the margin is less than one point.\n\n___\n\n2:40 a.m.\n\nDemocrat Tony Evers\u2019 running mate Mandela Barnes will become the first African American lieutenant governor in Wisconsin history.\n\nThe Evers victory over Republican Gov. Scott Walker means that Barnes will become just the second black person elected to statewide office in Wisconsin.\n\nVel Phillips was the first black person elected to statewide office in 1978. She served as secretary of state for one term.\n\nBarnes won an August primary and that paired him with Evers, who also survived a primary.\n\nThe 31-year-old Barnes is a former state representative from Milwaukee. He joked about the difference in age with Evers, who is more than twice as old as him at 67. They called themselves the \u201cTony and Mandela Show\u201d on the campaign trail, working to engage younger voters through stunts like live streaming their drive to a news conference.\n\n___\n\n2:25 a.m.\n\nWisconsin Gov. Scott Walker\u2019s campaign is alleging that \u201cthousands of ballots were damaged and had to be recreated\u201d in the election that saw Democrat Tony Evers score a narrow victory.\n\nWalker campaign spokesman Brian Reisinger says until the ballots can be examined, there is no way to judge their validity.\n\nReisinger also says that Walker wants to see the official canvas of the vote and for military ballots to be counted \u201cbefore any decision can be made.\u201d\n\nCounties have until 9 a.m. Tuesday to canvas the vote.\n\nWhile Walker looked for a way to escape the loss, Democrats exalted.\n\nEvers told exuberant supporters at a Madison theater that he was \u201cconfident\u201d in saying, \u201cI\u2019m going to be the next governor of the state of Wisconsin.\u201d\n\n___\n\n2:07 a.m.\n\nFor the first time in nearly a decade, Wisconsin will have a new governor.\n\nDemocrat Tony Evers narrowly beat Republican Gov. Scott Walker, but Walker declined to immediately concede.\n\nEvers\u2019 victory completed a Democratic sweep of the top two statewide prizes, after Democratic Sen.

(AP) \u2014 Wisconsin voters handed Democrats two huge victories, defeating Republican Gov. Scott Walker and handing Tammy Baldwin a second term in the U.S. Senate. But Democrats failed to unseat a single GOP legislator and their attorney general hopeful, Josh Kaul, was locked in a race with Republican incumbent Brad Schimel that was still too close to call Wednesday morning.\n\nEVERS DEFEATS WALKER\n\nDemocratic gubernatorial challenger Tony Evers narrowly defeated Walker, denying him a third term.

He says Schimel took too long to test thousands of unanalyzed sexual assault evidence kits, allowed testing delays at the state crime labs to grow, spent taxpayer money on commemorative coins for police and failed to get control of the state\u2019s opioid crisis.

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 It\u2019s a pivotal moment for Nancy Pelosi \u2014 the beginning of a triumphal return as the nation\u2019s first female House speaker, or the start of a political reckoning over who should lead Democrats in the Donald Trump era.\n\nWith Democrats winning control of the House, President Trump signaled Wednesday his support for Pelosi as speaker. In a tweet Trump said that Pelosi \u201chas earned this great honor\u201d and suggested the Republican party could help her secure the job. \u201cIf they (Democrats) give her a hard time, perhaps we will add some Republican votes,\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter.\n\nReclaiming the speaker\u2019s gavel could be Pelosi\u2019s last act, one she intends to use to restore the power of the office after GOP Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s retirement. She wants to impress on Americans the importance of the legislative branch as a co-equal branch of government.\n\n\u201cPeople will see a Congress that is very different than we have now,\u201d Pelosi told The Associated Press while campaigning in Arizona days before the election.\n\nThe California Democrat doesn\u2019t think Americans fully understand the significance of the speaker\u2019s job \u2014 which, after the vice president, is next in line to the White House.\n\n\u201cWhat I would do next would be to say, this is what this role is: It\u2019s the leading figure in the first branch of government, it has awesome power, and we get things done,\u201d she said. You have to \u201cshow the power of the gavel.\u201d\n\nPelosi was in a celebratory mood Tuesday evening, declaring that \u201ctomorrow will be a new day in America.\u201d\n\nFew leaders have reclaimed the House speaker\u2019s office after losing it and, as the first woman to wield the gavel, Pelosi\u2019s ascent would be a milestone.\n\nBut at 78, she knows her storied tenure on Capitol Hill is likely coming to a close, even if she refuses to put a date-stamp on it. A new generation of Democratic representatives, propelled by resurgent activism, is heading to the halls of Congress. That means change is coming, regardless of whether the House flips from Republican control.\n\nPelosi has campaigned tirelessly this election season. Fueled by a steady diet of chocolate, she crisscrossed 30 cities in a 31-day rush aimed at boosting Democratic candidates. She endured millions of dollars in GOP attack ads and Trump\u2019s rally cry against her \u201cradical Democratic agenda.\u201d She persuaded candidates to shut out the noise \u2014 \u201cdon\u2019t take the bait\u201d \u2014 and stick with their legislative agenda of lowering health care costs, rebuilding the nation\u2019s infrastructure and delivering government reforms. She also tamped down liberal cries for Trump\u2019s impeachment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about Democrats and Republicans at this point,\u201d she told volunteers in Pima County. \u201cIt\u2019s about our country.\u201d\n\nMidterm elections are often the \u201clounge act\u201d to the presidential contest, as she puts it, but the battle for the House quickly spun into the signature contest of 2018. Democratic candidates jumped into races, motivated by opposition to the president\u2019s agenda and the GOP\u2019s proposed changes to health care. Activists bypassed Pelosi\u2019s vast party apparatus, which shoveled $129 million to the Democratic campaign committee, and instead rewarded candidates through online donations and social media promotion.\n\nAs Pelosi played a starring role in GOP attack ads against them, several Democrats said flat-out they would not vote for her as leader. Some are from districts Trump won in 2016 and see the San Franciscan as too liberal, while others represent liberal strongholds that view her as too willing to compromise.\n\nProfessor Wendy Schiller, the chair of the political science department at Brown University, said even though Pelosi\u2019s legacy is as one of the shrewdest politicians of the 21st century, the younger generation doesn\u2019t \u201cthink they owe her anything.\u201d\n\nSchiller said, \u201cEverything about the rules of the game, about achieving power, has changed out from under her.\u201d\n\nPelosi comes from the old school of politics, taught by her father, the former mayor of Baltimore, and her mother, who ran a tight Italian-American household. Constituents would show up at her family\u2019s door, needing favors from her dad, who kept a file card system of requests asked and answered, a first lesson in the value of chits. A street in the city\u2019s charming Little Italy section bears her name \u2014 Via Nancy Alessandro Pelosi \u2014 celebrating the famous daughter who decamped for San Francisco and helped transform California from the state of Ronald Reagan to the headquarters of Trump resistance.\n\nTrump, though, showed an early interest in working with her, charmed at times by her deal-making prowess. If she returns as leader, it\u2019s easy to imagine Pelosi courting Trump\u2019s support on shared priorities ahead of the 2020 election, like a big infrastructure package or lower prescription drug prices that eluded past presidents \u2014 the kind of bipartisanship voters say they want from Washington.\n\nYet it\u2019s that kind of middle-road tack that risks alienating Democrats who want nothing to do with Trump. Expectations are high among Democrats and \u201cthey don\u2019t expect us to go in there and play it safe,\u201d said Arizona Rep. Raul Grijalva, a progressive caucus leader who supports Pelosi\u2019s leadership bid but acknowledges the pressures.\n\nPelosi isn\u2019t the only member of leadership younger members want to see move along. Top-ranking leaders Steny Hoyer and Jim Clyburn are also in their mid-70s.\n\nRep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., a Marine who recruited other veterans to run, said Democrats \u201cneed someone who can bring the party back together, someone who can be focused on the future and someone who is dedicated to supporting the next generation of leaders.\u201d\n\nHouse Democrats will meet behind closed doors later this month to elect party leaders, and Pelosi is expected to win the most votes in the caucus. But being elected as speaker in January requires the majority of the whole House \u2014 218 votes.\n\nPelosi, confident of Democrats winning the House, is hoping for a \u201cdecisive\u201d majority, some 230 seats, and optimistic she will again be elected speaker.\n\nThe mother of five, who came to the job after raising her family, said she \u201cnever used to be such a braggart\u201d but someone has to do it. Women, she says, shouldn\u2019t shy from a fight.\n\n\u201cI went from the kitchen to Congress,\u201d she said. \u201cI know how to pass legislation, I know how to win elections and I know part of my responsibility is to make way for the next generation of leaders.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow on Twitter at https://twitter.com/lisamascaro and AP\u2019s midterm coverage at https://apnews.com/apf-politics", "PEARL, Miss.

(Thad Allton /The Topeka Capital-Journal via AP)\n\nTOPEKA, Kan. (AP) \u2014 Republican Kris Kobach made fighting illegal immigration a key issue in running for Kansas governor, echoing President Donald Trump\u2019s tactics in the campaign\u2019s final weeks. It didn\u2019t work, and Democrat Laura Kelly defeated him.\n\nKelly won even though Kobach was Trumps\u2019 most visible ally in the state and the president came to Kansas to campaign for him.\n\nKobach wasn\u2019t the only Kansas Republican caught in Trump\u2019s immigration crossfire. Republican Rep. Kevin Yoder, chairman of a House subcommittee on homeland security, lost his seat after he he was criticized for not opposing more fervently Trump\u2019s policy of separating of immigrant families at the border.\n\nKelly wooed GOP moderates and independent voters in the governor\u2019s race while Kobach concentrated only on his conservative base. She made the race a referendum on unpopular former Republican Gov. Sam Brownback\u2019s 2012-13 experiment in slashing income taxes that left a hole in state finances. Most of the tax cuts were reversed last year.\n\nShe told her supporters Tuesday night that voters spoke \u201cwith a single, thunderous voice\u201d in demanding bipartisanship.\n\n\u201cKansans voted for change, a change not only in the direction of our state but a change in the tone in our state,\u201d she declared.\n\nKobach had promised a no-apologies style of conservatism, and attacking illegal immigration has long been part of his political brand. He promised to pursue policies to encourage immigrants living in the state illegally to leave. Like Trump, he made a caravan of several thousand migrants moving through Mexico an issue late in the campaign.\n\n\u201cWe fought the good fight,\u201d he told his supporters Tuesday night in his concession speech at a Topeka hotel. \u201cThis one just wasn\u2019t God\u2019s will.\u201d\n\nKelly said that while she favors secure borders, combatting illegal immigration requires comprehensive legislation from Congress. She said Kobach\u2019s immigration policies would hurt the state\u2019s economy, particularly in western Kansas, which depends on immigrant workers for the meatpacking industry.\n\nEllie Smith, a 24-year-old Democratic voter, stay-at-home mom and musician from Topeka, said Kobach\u2019s positions on immigration \u201churts my heart.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe that everybody belongs here,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Immigration issue highlights a longstanding split in the Kansas GOP that has led to the state alternating between Republican and Democratic governors over the past 50 years despite a sizeable GOP advantage among registered voters.\n\nKelly benefited from the unpopularity of Brownback, whose tax cutting experiment was labeled a failure even by some national Republicans. He resigned in January to take an ambassador\u2019s post in Trump\u2019s administration. Kobach barely defeated Brownback\u2019s appointed successor, Gov. Jeff Colyer, in the Republican primary in August.\n\nKelly\u2019s message of higher spending on education resonated with some Republican voters such as Kimberli Evans, a 43-year-old federal employee from Topeka.\n\nShe said fair funding for public schools was one of her big concerns.\n\n\u201cI believe that the Brownback experiment did not work and needs to be reversed,\u201d Evans said after casting her ballot.\n\n___\n\nFollow John Hanna on Twitter: https://twitter.com/apjdhanna .\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics\n\n.", "Republican U.S. Rep.

Both candidates say they're encouraged by strong early voting turnout statewide. (Nov. 6)\n\nCruz began the race as Texas\u2019 most-powerful and popular Republican. But he needed a boost from Trump to win re-election over a previously little-known congressman and former punk rocker from West Texas who, even in defeat, is now one of Democrats\u2019 brightest up-and-coming stars.\n\nThe race was never supposed to be this close in America\u2019s largest red state but laid bare how Cruz\u2019s 2016 clashes with Trump alienated much of his conservative base \u2014 and how the president remains popular enough to get supporters to coalesce around him.\n\nThe results broke as expected. White voters favored Cruz over O\u2019Rourke, including those with and without a college degree, according to AP VoteCast, a wide-ranging survey of the electorate in Texas.\n\nO\u2019Rourke had a sizable advantage among black voters and also was preferred among Hispanic voters, who historically have voted in low numbers but who O\u2019Rourke needed to have a shot.

But at the end of the day we won. Texas is going to stay red.\u201d\n\nCruz turned back O\u2019Rourke with the help of Trump, his bitter rival in 2016. Trump took the unexpected step of traveling to reliably Republican Texas during crunch time, staging a Houston rally to energize his base for Cruz just two weeks before Election Day. The president praised the senator as \u201cbeautiful\u201d and smart, a far cry from two years ago when he repeatedly mocked Cruz as \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted,\u201d made fun of his wife\u2019s appearance and suggested that Cruz\u2019s Cuban-born father had a hand in the assassination of John F.

Reynolds will listen to those voices loud and clear,\u201d Hubbell said.\n\nThe governor\u2019s race broke a fundraising record for a governor\u2019s race, with $18 million raised by Hubbell \u2014 including $6.4 million of his own money \u2014 and nearly $11 million raised by Reynolds.\n\nVictories by Democrats Abby Finkenauer in northeast Iowa\u2019s 1st District and Cindy Axne in southwest Iowa\u2019s 3rd District mean Iowa will send its first female representatives to the U.S. House.

(AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Paul Ryan had to know it was coming.\n\nThe minute the House speaker shot down President Donald Trump\u2019s latest campaign-season gambit on immigration \u2014 an assertion that he could rewrite citizenship rights with the stroke of a pen \u2014 Ryan had to be braced for Trump\u2019s counterpunch. True to form, the next day, less than a week before Election Day, the hit came in a tweet. The Republican president publicly declared that the Republican speaker \u201cknows nothing about!\u201d birthright citizenship.\n\nRyan picked up the phone and called the president to tell him he\u2019d gone too far.\n\nIndeed, Trump had been on a tear. Instead of closing out the midterm campaigns hailing congressional Republicans\u2019 signature accomplishment \u2014 a massive tax cut \u2014 Trump was railing against a migrant caravan still hundreds of miles from the U.S. border. The migrants were a national security threat, he said. He was sending more than 5,000 troops to the border.\n\nEnough about immigration, Ryan told him.\n\nThe extraordinary call, which has not previously been reported, barely made a ripple in Trump\u2019s White House. The president had no intention of following the soon-to-be-retired speaker\u2019s advice. Later that day, Trump would declare he might even send 15,000 troops. By the next day, he claimed he\u2019d told the military that if migrants try to throw rocks, the troops should act as though the rocks are \u201crifles.\u201d\n\nRyan would call Trump again days later to no avail. His failed effort to refocus Trump was illustrative of Republicans\u2019 back-to-back struggles that had run, mostly in the background, for months. At first, the struggle was to get Trump to pay attention to the election. Then it became an effort to curb his excesses when he finally did.\n\nInterviews by The Associated Press with Democratic, Republican and White House insiders make clear that Trump \u2014 with his drumbeat of provocations and his invective about the migrant-caravan-loving \u201cDemocrat mob,\u201d \u2033Pocahontas,\u201d \u2033evil\u201d on the other side and \u201clow IQ\u201d \u2014 put people in both parties on the spot. Take him on? Avert your eyes? Excuse him? Embrace the blunt, crowd-pleasing talk? Responses differed, even in the same party. But one election truism, voiced by a White House official, came to the fore: Contented voters tend not to vote. Angry, fearful ones do.\n\nIn a campaign of raw passions, intersecting with a slaughter in a Pittsburgh synagogue and mail bombs targeting some of the Democratic subjects of Trump\u2019s wrath, there was little room for contentment in the election that would flip control of the House to Democrats while preserving Republican control of the Senate.\n\nThis account of the midterm campaign is based on interviews with more than 25 campaign operatives, party officials and White House aides, most of whom spoke to the AP about blunders, high points and turning points on condition their words not be used until control of Congress had been decided. Some spoke on condition of anonymity to describe operations they were unauthorized to speak about publicly.\n\n___\n\nWHERE\u2019S THE PRESIDENT?\n\nFor Republicans, a sense the sky was falling formed early this year when Democrat Conor Lamb took a House seat in solid Republican territory from the GOP with a victory in March over Rick Saccone. The contest left a bitter aftertaste for Republicans who saw their party struggle to find new and appealing candidates to step in for a wave of retirees. Meanwhile, Democrats fielded a diverse lineup of contenders, some with potential star power like Lamb, an ex-Marine who won again Tuesday night.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re casting a movie about a congressman, Conor Lamb could play the role,\u201d said Corry Bliss, who runs a super PAC aligned with Ryan. \u201cAnd we have to spend three months banging our heads against the wall trying to get someone elected who I think was physically allergic to raising money and doing work.\u201d\n\nEven after the Pennsylvania harbinger, House Republicans found it difficult to get Trump\u2019s interest.\n\nThe House majority leader, Kevin McCarthy, raced to strike deals with jittery lawmakers, trying to persuade them not to retire. He worked to recruit the best candidates with sometimes disappointing results.\n\nTrump was largely uninterested, frustrating House Republicans. In August, McCarthy tried to engage Trump, organizing a conference call with the president, GOP House campaign chairman Steve Stivers and Republican Troy Balderson, who was running in a special election in Ohio. The president got off the call and enthusiastically tweeted his support for Stivers \u2014 the wrong man.\n\nOver time, the majority leader helped drive home the stakes of losing the House with a what\u2019s-in-it-for-Trump checklist, a party official said. The most obvious would be the difficulty of passing Trump\u2019s agenda with a split Congress. As well, the House has powers of investigation, and Democrats planned to use them against a president who already feels dogged by \u201cwitch hunts.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump said he\u2019d adopt a \u201cwarlike posture\u201d if House Democrats come after him with investigations of his financial and other matters \u2014 and try to use the Senate to retalitate.\n\n__\n\nWHERE\u2019S THE MONEY?\n\nCash was another issue.\n\nIn June, top Republicans gathered at a luxury mountainside resort in Park City, Utah, for Mitt Romney\u2019s annual political retreat. Among the speakers was Michael Bloomberg, the former Republican-turned-independent mayor of New York, a fixture at gatherings of wealthy political influencers.\n\nSomething about Bloomberg\u2019s 40-minute speech felt different this time. As guests exited, several commented to the AP that Bloomberg sounded like he was giving a Democratic presidential stump speech.\n\n\u201cTwo or three weeks later, I walked out of my quarterly board meeting, and there it was on my phone: Bloomberg announces he\u2019s spending $100 million to help Democrats take back the House,\u201d Bliss said. \u201cIt all made sense.\u201d\n\nBloomberg\u2019s influx of cash caught Republicans off guard and opened a fundraising deficit that the GOP couldn\u2019t come close to making up.\n\n\u201cIt was a real game changer,\u201d Bliss said. \u201cIt would have been manageable without that.\u201d\n\nSome GOP officials had complaints about how money was spent by the National Republican Congressional Committee\u2019s independent expenditure arm.\n\nFor example, money continued to be poured into Rep. Barbara Comstock\u2019s suburban Virginia district long after party leaders deemed the race a lost cause. Democrat Jennifer Wexton defeated her Tuesday.\n\nIn Florida\u2019s 26th district, the outside group locked in TV airtime for the fall in July when rates were cheaper. In September, the group canceled the buy \u2014 only to rebook it one day later at a far higher rate. Democrats narrowly prevailed there Tuesday.\n\nBy Labor Day, Charlie Kelly, executive director of House Majority PAC, the outside group supporting Democrats, had already secured more than $40 million for TV ads to run after the holiday, twice the usual amount.\n\nHis Republican counterparts had already burned through as much cash just propping up the unpopular GOP tax plan and efforts at a repeal of President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law. That was on top of huge sums Republicans spent salvaging GOP seats in special elections.\n\n___\n\nHOUSE DEMS ON TRACK\n\nDemocrats had far less trouble keeping members and allies on course with their message to voters.\n\nThe script was set early. In February, the House Majority PAC asked Republican voters in suburban swing districts to journal, for three days, about their priorities. People wrote about their views on open-ended questions: What do Democrats stand for? Republicans?\n\nWhat voters scribbled in their online notebooks, and said in focus groups later about the president, showed Democrats the importance of clearing out the noise of the Trump administration and focusing on the kitchen table issues. Perhaps the partisan divide wasn\u2019t so wide after all.\n\n\u201cThat to me was sort of an eye-opening moment,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cMy goodness, we can win these places.\u201d\n\nAlmost every time Trump interjected a new topic \u2014 Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, the migrant caravans \u2014 the top House Democrat, Nancy Pelosi, would urge colleagues to stay focused on lower health care costs, better jobs by rebuilding infrastructure, spending more on education and cleaning up government.\n\n\u201cOur candidates are sticking with that message no matter what he does or says,\u201d Pelosi said during a Tucson, Arizona-area swing through a GOP open seat that Republicans all but abandoned weeks earlier.\n\nThey also went looking for new Democratic voters \u2014 particularly in Florida.\n\nThe resettlement of Puerto Ricans fleeing to Florida after Hurricane Maria in 2017 was a key opportunity.\n\nEstimates of the number who came to Florida fluctuated. Many did not have permanent addresses where campaign staff and volunteers could find them to encourage them to register to vote.\n\nBut they did have cellphones.\n\nPeople on the Democratic National Committee\u2019s technology team, led by former Uber executive Raffi Krikorian, wondered if they could use those cellphone numbers to track which people from the island were now living in Florida. The Democratic group had already spent $1 million to add 100 million cellphone numbers to its voter database.\n\nThis time, the DNC bought voter information from commercial aggregators that tracked what cellphone towers certain numbers were pinging off. They focused on Puerto Rican cellphone numbers that pinged off towers in Florida for 30 days or more \u2014 a timeline that DNC officials believed showed that a person had relocated to the state.\n\nThe search resulted in 300,000 numbers in Florida alone, as well as thousands more in other states. The DNC started texting messages to those numbers encouraging people to register to vote and back Democratic candidates.\n\n___\n\nHERE\u2019S THE PRESIDENT\n\nBy midsummer, top Republican operatives were bracing for the prospect of losing up to 60 seats in the House, far more than the 23 the Democrats needed to take control. There was even talk of Democrats taking the Senate, although those races were largely in conservative-leaning states.\n\nOn the House side, Trump\u2019s volatility was hurting Republicans in the polls, particularly with independents and women. His cozy appearance alongside Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, Finland, didn\u2019t help matters, and his administration\u2019s child separation policy at the U.S.-Mexico border exponentially deepened the damage.\n\nOne GOP operative described the summer trend as getting worse by the day.\n\nBy Labor Day, many Republicans were so outwardly worried that the House was lost that they were already dissecting how it all went wrong and assigning blame. Democrats were widening the battleground, polling in many districts looked dismal for the GOP and Trump didn\u2019t seem to care.\n\nThen Kavanaugh took his seat in the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing room.\n\nThe Supreme Court nominee\u2019s wrought, explosive defense of the sexual allegations against him did more than clear the way for his confirmation. It gave Republicans a rallying cry against the \u201cmob\u201d \u2014 the emerging buzzword that summed up Democratic opposition to Kavanaugh, to the GOP-held Congress and to Trump\u2019s agenda.\n\nRepublicans needed anger on their side, said a party official, and suddenly had it.\n\nMany Republicans believed the #MeToo movement had gone too far and a good man\u2019s reputation had been smeared.\n\nTrump, now in full campaign mode, rolled into his hotel late the night of the Kavanaugh hearing for a House Republican fundraiser. His tardiness hardly mattered. He regaled donors and GOP lawmakers with stories as if it were their own private Trump rally. The event brought in $15 million for House campaign committees.\n\nFundraising went through the roof. The Sunday after the Thursday, Sept. 27, hearing was the largest online fundraising day in the Republican National Committee\u2019s history. Small-dollar donations soared 418 percent in the days afterward. A single text message, which usually brings in about $10,000, brought in seven times that amount on a Saturday.\n\n___\n\nTHE KAVANAUGH EFFECT\n\nOn Oct. 4, Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, a moderate in conservative North Dakota, sat in a secure room at the U.S. Capitol, peering through black-framed glasses at the FBI report about Kavanaugh.\n\nShe looked up from the table and said quietly to fellow Democratic senators in the room: \u201cI can\u2019t do this\u201d \u2014 meaning she could not vote to confirm the man who\u2019d been accused of sexual assault.\n\nThere was a heavy tone of reservation in her voice. One colleague said that it was painful for her and that she knew she was committing political suicide.\n\nHeitkamp would not recover. Republican Kevin Cramer defeated her Tuesday.\n\nNorth Dakota wasn\u2019t an outlier. Working-class voters, particularly men, had the same reaction to the Kavanaugh allegation.\n\nIn the days after his accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, testified on Capitol Hill, the chairwoman of the Wisconsin Democratic Party called the DNC with an urgent warning: The confirmation fight appeared to be galvanizing white men in rural parts of Wisconsin \u2014 the same voters who helped tilt the state toward Trump in the 2016 election.\n\nChairwoman Martha Laning told DNC officials that her team had been monitoring Republican pages on Facebook and other social media sites and was suddenly seeing more engagement from men than earlier in the year, according to one Democratic official.\n\nThe hearing was an \u201cadrenaline shot\u201d for GOP voters, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said in his post-election appraisal Wednesday.\n\nDemocrats\u2019 hopes of pulling off a wave powerful enough to give them Senate control faded fast.\n\nPrivately, Democratic officials were more conservative than they were letting on about their prospects in Texas in the Senate race between Republican Sen. Ted Cruz and Democratic Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke. Although O\u2019Rourke was raising eye-popping amounts of money and drawing national attention, his campaign wasn\u2019t doing some basic things, like polling. He lost Tuesday.\n\nBy mid-October, Democrats had largely given up on Heitkamp. If the state weren\u2019t so inexpensive, campaign groups probably would have pulled out weeks before, according to one Democratic official. But with the low cost of television time and other campaign infrastructure, Democratic campaign committees decided it was better to keep spending a bit of money there than to be seen abandoning an incumbent senator.\n\nAmong Democrats\u2019 most vulnerable Senate candidates was Bill Nelson, the 76-year-old former astronaut who had held his seat since 2001. The biggest boost for Nelson came when Florida Democrats nominated Andrew Gillum \u2014 the young black mayor of Tallahassee \u2014 as their candidate for governor.\n\nGillum instantly energized Florida Democrats, giving Nelson a boost in the process. According to one Democratic official, the party probably would have written the Senate seat off if it hadn\u2019t been for Gillum\u2019s primary victory. Gillum lost Tuesday; Nelson\u2019s race was too close to call.\n\n___\n\nTHE MIGRANTS\n\nKavanaugh was sworn in a month before Election Day. House Republicans knew they could neither sustain the momentum nor keep the president focused for that long.\n\nTrump quickly found his closing message.\n\nThe president sent out his first tweet about the caravan on Oct. 16. At a Montana rally two days later, he declared the election was about \u201cjobs versus mobs.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis will be an election of Kavanaugh, the caravan, law and order, and common sense,\u201d Trump said.\n\nA White House official said the rhetoric reflected the understanding that contented voters aren\u2019t engaged voters. Fear drives turnout, the official said.\n\nThe president, acknowledging his tax cut was failing to drive voters, pledged a second one would come. Then that idea seemed to vanish. Trump conceded economic talk was less interesting and garnered less buzz than his immigration threats.\n\nOver the following three weeks, Trump, his administration and his campaign deployed ever more dire warnings about the consequences of Democratic control of Congress. The president stoked fears about illegal immigration and predicted economic collapse if Democrats won.\n\nTrump\u2019s fierce words about the migrants \u2014 as reflected in his suggestion that they\u2019d be shot by U.S. authorities if they threw rocks \u2014 were enough to make some Republicans wish the election were two weeks earlier, in what they perceived as the Kavanaugh bump.\n\nIt stopped the moment, a GOP operative said.\n\nIndependent-minded voters who thought Democrats went overboard in assailing Kavanaugh were now viewing Trump as having gone over the top.\n\nIt may not have helped Democrats, but it made some voters disengage, the operative said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Cal Woodward, Jill Colvin, Catherine Lucey, Jonathan Lemire and Steve Peoples in Washington and Thomas Beaumont in Des Moines, Iowa, contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "A look at some of the winners in House races around the US\n\nNew York Democratic congressional candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez speaks with reporters after voting, Tuesday Nov. 6, 2018, in the Parkchester community of the Bronx, N.Y. (AP Photo/Bebeto Matthews)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The vote to determine control of the House featured significant milestones. The candidates included 237 women, more than ever before. Among the winners were the youngest woman ever elected to Congress and several who broke racial or other barriers. A look at some of the victorious candidates:\n\nALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (New York Democrat)\n\nAt 29, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is the youngest woman elected to Congress. Ocasio-Cortez has said she is still paying off her student loans and until recently had no health insurance.\n\nShe shocked many in New York politics, including herself, when she came out of nowhere to defeat 10-term Rep. Joe Crowley in New York\u2019s Democratic congressional primary last spring.\n\nThe victory made her the national face of young, discontented Democrats \u2014 often women and minorities \u2014 trying to shove their party to the left.\n\nOcasio-Cortez was born in the Bronx but raised in suburban Westchester County. Her father died while she was a student at Boston University in 2008. She got her start in politics as an organizer for Sen. Bernie Sanders. She calls herself a \u201cDemocratic socialist\u201d and supports a national $15 minimum wage and universal health care coverage.\n\nShe takes the record for the youngest woman elected to Congress from Rep. Elise Stefanik, a Republican representing upstate New York who was elected at age 30. American voters have elected many men in their 20s to Congress.\n\n___\n\nABBY FINKENAUER (Iowa Democrat)\n\nAbby Finkenauer on Tuesday became the second-youngest woman elected to Congress. Also 29, she is a little more than 10 months older than Ocasio-Cortez. She is also still paying off her student loans.\n\nFinkenauer knocked off two-term Republican incumbent Rep. Rod Blum in a fiercely contested race.\n\nShe grew up in the northeastern Iowa district she will now represent and has served four years in the Iowa House representing Dubuque.\n\nFinkenauer has worked for a nonprofit that sought to increase the minimum wage and expand family leave.\n\nShe styled herself as a folksy champion of working-class families such as her own. A favorite of labor unions, she has frequently discussed how her father is a welder and her mother is a school district employee.\n\nRepublicans, including President Donald Trump, nicknamed her \u201cAbsent Abby\u201d for missing some votes in the Legislature and painted her as too inexperienced.\n\n___\n\nABIGAIL SPANBERGER (Virginia Democrat)\n\nThe Democrat and political newcomer who unseated a two-term Republican congressman in a Virginia GOP stronghold spent nearly a decade as a CIA operations officer working on counterterrorism and nuclear proliferation cases.\n\nAbigail Spanberger, 39, also worked as a federal postal inspector, handling narcotics and money-laundering cases.\n\nAbout two years after leaving the CIA, Spanberger decided to run for Congress in Virginia\u2019s 7th District, a mix of suburbs west and south of Richmond and large rural areas.\n\nThe married mother of three young daughters said she became increasingly disturbed by the sharp political divide in the country, Trump\u2019s travel ban on predominantly Muslim countries and the GOP\u2019s unsuccessful attempt to repeal Obamacare.\n\nThe district has been held by Republicans since 1971.\n\nDuring the campaign, Spanberger cast herself as a moderate and portrayed incumbent Rep. Dave Brat as inaccessible and out of touch with his constituents. She also successfully tapped into anger over Trump among suburban voters.\n\nPETE STAUBER (Minnesota Republican)\n\nPete Stauber calls himself a \u201cblue-collar conservative.\u201d He traded on his law enforcement and hockey background, and his support for President Donald Trump, to win the 8th District race in what used to be reliably Democratic northeastern Minnesota. The district is now swing territory \u2014 Trump won it by 15 percentage points. Democratic Rep. Rick Nolan\u2019s decision to retire gave the GOP what was seen as its best chance anywhere to flip a blue seat.\n\nStauber, 52, served 22 years on the Duluth police force, retiring last year. He has been a St. Louis County commissioner from Hermantown since 2013. In a district where organized labor is still a force, it didn\u2019t hurt that he\u2019s the former president of the Duluth officers\u2019 union.\n\nAnd in a hockey-crazy state, it had to help that he comes from a noted hockey family. Stauber captained Lake Superior State to the NCAA Division I championship in 1988, then played minor-league hockey in the Detroit Red Wings organization. One brother, former NHL player Robb Stauber, coached the gold medal-winning U.S. women\u2019s team in the 2018 Olympics. Pete Stauber and his brothers own a hockey store in Duluth.\n\n___\n\nDEBRA HAALAND (New Mexico Democrat)\n\nDebra Haaland has become the one of the first Native American woman elected to Congress, joining Kansas Democrat Sharice Davids. A third Native American, New Mexico Republican Yvette Herrell, was leading her race.\n\nThere has only been one previous Native American in Congress: Ben Nighthorse Campbell, who represented Colorado for three terms in the Senate.\n\nHaaland, 57, a tribal member of the Laguna Pueblo who was born in Winslow, Arizona, defeated a crowded field of mainly Hispanic candidates in the Democratic primary.\n\nA former chairwoman of the Democratic Party of New Mexico, she has promised to push for renewable energy, immigration reform and a higher minimum wage. She also vowed to fight poverty in Native American communities and climate change.\n\n___\n\nSHARICE DAVIDS (Kansas Democrat)\n\nSharice Davids introduced herself to voters with a video of her kicking a large punching bag, then upended politics in deep-red Kansas by ousting a Republican incumbent and becoming the first LGBT Native American elected to Congress.\n\nDavids defeated Rep. Kevin Yoder in Tuesday\u2019s election in the Kansas City area\u2019s 3rd District. The 38-year-old activist, lawyer and political newcomer already garnered national attention as part of a crop of diverse Democratic candidates.\n\nShe was helped by the district itself. President Donald Trump narrowly lost its mix of poor urban neighborhoods, established suburbs and rapidly expanding bedroom communities in 2016, and Trump endorsed Yoder in July.\n\nDavids emerged from a six-person Democratic primary and energized voters and Democratic donors by emphasizing her biography. Her history includes a few professional and amateur mixed martial arts fights.\n\nShe\u2019s a member of the Wisconsin-based Ho-Chunk Nation and was raised by a single mother who served in the Army and worked for the U.S. Postal Service. Davids spent eight years working her way through college, obtaining a law degree from Cornell University. She was a White House fellow in 2016-17 and worked for the U.S. Department of Transportation.\n\n__\n\nLAUREN UNDERWOOD (Illinois Democrat)\n\nDemocrat Lauren Underwood, a 32-year-old African-American nurse from suburban Chicago, defeated four-term Republican Rep. Randy Hultgren Tuesday to become the first woman and first minority to represent a traditionally GOP-leaning Illinois congressional district.\n\nIn her first bid for public office, Underwood topped Hultgren in a district once held by GOP House Speaker Dennis Hastert.\n\nUnderwood worked in President Barack Obama\u2019s administration, helping implement the Affordable Care Act and working on the federal response to the water crisis in Flint, Michigan. She said she left that job and returned to Illinois after Donald Trump became president because it was clear he wanted to end or reverse much of the work she\u2019d been doing.\n\nLike many other Democrats, Underwood made health care the centerpiece of her campaign, saying she decided to get in the race after Hultgren voted for GOP legislation that would have made coverage of pre-existing conditions more expensive. She spoke often about the importance of uch coverage, saying she had seen it firsthand as both a nurse and a person with a heart condition.\n\nHer bid drew national attention, including a Time magazine cover and a Ben and Jerry\u2019s ice cream flavor. Former Vice President Joe Biden campaigned with her last week.\n\n___\n\nANTONIO DELGADO (New York Democrat)\n\nAntonio Delgado went from Rhodes Scholar to rap artist to corporate lawyer before launching a career in politics.\n\nInspired by a surge of liberal Democratic activism following President Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration, Delgado moved last year from the New York City suburbs to Rhinebeck in New York\u2019s Hudson Valley, home region of his wife, and began a run against Republican Rep. John Faso.\n\nDelgado, 41, emerged from working-class roots in Schenectady, New York, to study at the University of Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar and earn a law degree from Harvard University. He then pivoted to a brief hip-hop career in Los Angeles, where he rapped under the name \u201cAD the Voice\u201d about income inequality, war and criminal justice reform.\n\nThough Delgado went on to become a litigator for an international law firm representing Fortune 500 companies, Republicans seized on his brief rap career to portray Delgado, who is black, as unfit for office. They claimed his lyrics denigrated police, women and American values. Delgado\u2019s supporters called it race-baiting.\n\nDelgado campaigned on a platform of expanding Medicare, job creation and eliminating tax loopholes for the rich. He depicted Faso, who joined Congress last year, as beholden to corporate interests.\n\n___\n\nAYANNA PRESSLEY (Massachusetts Democrat)\n\nAyanna Pressley is the first black woman elected to the House from Massachusetts. The 44-year-old Democrat sailed through Tuesday\u2019s general election unopposed, two months after a surprise unseating of 10-term Rep. Michael Capuano in the state primary, an upset victory that drew comparisons to that of Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nHer Boston-area district, once represented by John F. Kennedy, is now the first in Massachusetts where minorities make up a majority of the voting population.\n\nIn 2009, Pressley was the first African-American elected to the Boston City Council. Before that, she worked as an aide to Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy and Sen. John Kerry.\n\nIdeologically, Pressley was like the candidate she defeated in the primary: liberal, a self-described progressive. But the white, middle-aged incumbent didn\u2019t look like many voters in his district, even though Pressley herself had bristled at the notion that race was a defining issue in the contest.\n\nBut Pressley also made clear the importance of diversity in the nation\u2019s halls of power.\n\n\u201cI do think that our democracy is strengthened by an engagement of new and different voices,\u201d she told college newspaper editors in Boston in October.\n\n___\n\nILHAN OMAR (Minnesota Democrat)\n\nThe nation\u2019s first Somali-American state legislator has carved her place in history again as the first Somali elected to Congress and one of its first Muslim women.\n\nOmar, a Democrat who served a single term in the Minnesota Legislature, easily won Tuesday\u2019s election for the Minneapolis-area congressional district being vacated by Rep. Keith Ellison.\n\nOmar was born in Somalia but spent much of her childhood in a Kenyan refugee camp as civil war tore apart her home country. She immigrated to the United States at age 12, teaching herself English by watching American TV and eventually settling with her family in Minneapolis, home to the world\u2019s largest Somali population outside of East Africa.\n\nHer political rise began in 2016, when she unseated a 44-year incumbent in a Democratic primary en route to winning her legislative seat later that year.\n\nOmar\u2019s win was a near lock because Minnesota\u2019s 5th Congressional District is heavily liberal. But her campaign was still dogged by some questions, including allegations that she used state House campaign funding for personal expenses such as a divorce attorney and international travel. She denied the allegations and said the Republican state lawmaker behind them was \u201cusing taxpayer dollars to harass a Muslim candidate.\u201d\n\n____\n\nRASHIDA TLAIB (Michigan Democrat)\n\nWhen Rashida Tlaib won the Democratic primary to run for the Detroit-area congressional seat long held by Rep. John Conyers, her relatives in the West Bank greeted the news with a mixture of pride and hope that she\u2019d be able to take on a U.S. administration widely seen as hostile to Muslims and the Palestinian cause.\n\nTlaib, 42, was elected Tuesday to Michigan\u2019s 13th House District seat. Her win was all but guaranteed because the Republicans did not even field a candidate. Tlaib and Somali-American Ilhan Omar of Minnesota will be first two female Muslim members of Congress.\n\nTlaib, the eldest of 14 children, is an attorney aligned with the liberal wing of the Democratic Party and has said that if elected to the House, she\u2019d push for higher wages and better worker protections.\n\nAs the first Muslim woman to serve in the Michigan Legislature, Tlaib sought to defend Detroit\u2019s poor, taking on refineries and a billionaire trucking magnate she accused of polluting city neighborhoods.\n\nTlaib fills a seat representing parts of Detroit and its suburbs that was long held by Conyers, who resigned last year amid complaints that he had sexually harassed former female staffers.\n\n_____\n\nDONNA SHALALA (Florida Democrat)\n\nAfter serving in President Bill Clinton\u2019s Cabinet and running major universities, Donna Shalala is starting a third career with her election to the House.\n\nThe 77-year-old Democrat won Tuesday in a Miami district that had long been in Republican hands. Shalala has sought to turn her age into a positive by stressing her experience with this slogan: \u201cReady on Day One.\u201d\n\nShalala served as Clinton\u2019s secretary of Health and Human Services for his entire presidency and has made health care a centerpiece of her agenda. She was president of the University of Wisconsin before that, and after Cabinet service she ran the University of Miami until 2015.\n\nAfter that, Shalala was president of the Clinton Foundation until 2017. She counts the Clintons as close friends; Hillary Clinton campaigned for her this year in Miami.\n\nAsked in a recent interview why she chose to take this fresh path after such a long career, Shalala said: \u201cWhat I decided in my mind was that I wasn\u2019t finished with public service. I wanted to take a shot.\u201d\n\nShalala is originally from Cleveland, is of Lebanese descent and has a twin sister. She has lived in the Miami area since 2001.\n\n_____\n\nDEBBIE MUCARSEL-POWELL (Florida Democrat)\n\nDemocrat Debbie Mucarsel-Powell emigrated from Ecuador at age 14, lived for a time in a one-room Miami apartment with her family and is now headed to the U.S. House after defeating a Republican incumbent.\n\nMucarsel-Powell ousted GOP Rep. Carlos Curbelo in Tuesday\u2019s election in her first try for federal office, representing a district that stretches from south of Miami to Key West. She ran unsuccessfully for the Florida Senate in 2016.\n\nHer first job as a teenager was at a doughnut shop, but she worked to get a bachelor\u2019s degree and a graduate degree from Claremont University in international political economy.\n\nMucarsel-Powell has spent most of her adult career working for nonprofit organizations in Miami such as the Coral Restoration Foundation and the Zoo Miami Foundation. She was an associate dean at Florida International University college of medicine.\n\nAmong her top issues are expanding access to health care, addressing climate change, curbing gun violence, making college affordable and providing workers with a living wage. She has also pledged to hold the Trump administration accountable.\u201d\n\n______\n\nAssociated Press writers Karen Matthews in New York City; Ryan Foley in Iowa City, Iowa; Denise Lavoie in Richmond, Va.; Russell Contreras in Albuquerque, N.M.; John Hanna in Topeka, Kan.; Mary Esch in Kingston, N.Y.; William J.

Heidi Heitkamp and her Republican challenger Kevin Cramer. (AP Photo/Bruce Crummy, File)\n\nBISMARCK, N.D. (AP) \u2014 Republicans once again had their way in North Dakota, punctuated by Kevin Cramer\u2019s victory over Heidi Heitkamp in a highly charged U.S. Senate race and Kelly Armstrong\u2019s quieter but convincing win to fill Cramer\u2019s U.S. House seat.\n\nIt didn\u2019t end there. The GOP \u2014 along with Republican-turned-independent Secretary of State Al Jaeger \u2014 once again swept the state offices and saw a noncitizen voting measure pass after it was put on the ballot in part to counter turnout for an initiative to legalize marijuana.\n\nAnd the pot measure went down, just two years after voters said yes to medicinal marijuana.\n\nThe Democrats were clinging to a couple of bright spots heading into Thursday. A government ethics measure that the Democrats have tried to pass in various forms was leading and Republican House Majority Al Carlson was in third place in the race for two south Fargo spots as the final votes were tallied.\n\nHere\u2019s a rundown on the election:\n\nU.S. SENATE\n\nBoth the winner and loser in one of North Dakota\u2019s most expensive political battles used similar expressions to summarize their political exploits.\n\nCramer says the victory was the \u201chonor\u201d of his life. Heitkamp says serving in the Senate was the \u201chighest honor\u201d of her life.\n\nCramer won by persuading North Dakota voters that his emphatic conservatism would serve them better than her occasional independence from her own party. Heitkamp portrayed herself as an independent who wasn\u2019t afraid to vote against her own party or vote with President Donald Trump.\n\nHeitkamp raised more than $27 million for her re-election campaign. That was almost five times as much as Cramer, who called it a \u201cbunch of money to push a bad message.\u201d\n\nMARIJUANA\n\nNorth Dakota voters aren\u2019t ready to take the next step with marijuana, soundly rejecting a proposal to legalize it broadly just two years after they OK\u2019d medicinal marijuana.\n\nLaw enforcement argued it would lead to more violent crime, accidents and workplace issues. The state also estimated it would be expensive, in part because of a provision in the proposed law that would wipe past marijuana-related convictions off people\u2019s records.\n\nNorth Dakota State University student Lindsey Pouliot, a senior majoring in English, said she favors decriminalizing marijuana, but didn\u2019t like the way the bill was written.\n\nBackers argued the legalization would free up law enforcement to tackle more serious crimes. They were counting on a shoe-leather campaign to build support, raising little money for their effort and getting only token help from national legalization groups.\n\nBecky Eckdahl, 53, a server at a Bismarck deli, voted in favor of the legalization.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been smoking it since I was 11 years old. I\u2019ve never gotten arrested, never had any problems with it, never lost a job,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a good thing.\u201d\n\nETHICS MEASURE\n\nAlthough the so-called \u201canti-corruption\u201d measure is sponsored by a bipartisan group, it\u2019s something Democrats have fought unsuccessfully for years to do.\n\nBackers say the measure will add transparency and accountability to government. They raised more than $400,000 to push it, with much of the money coming from left-leaning out-of-state groups.\n\nOpponents argued the state has no ethics problem. In the Republican-led Legislature, leaders said the measure isn\u2019t needed because lawmakers already follow high standards of conduct. The American Civil Liberties Union opposed the measure, saying it restricts political speech and advocacy.\n\nJolene Vidal, 43, Bismarck, who works for the state Department of Transportation, voted in favor of the measure because she wants to know where \u201ccampaign funding is coming from.\u201d\n\nNONCITIZEN VOTING\n\nVoters passed a proposal to amend the North Dakota Constitution to explicitly bar non-U.S. citizens from voting. The document already defines a voter as a U.S. citizen, but supporters argue the wording is ambiguous and needs to be clarified.\n\nGary Emineth, a former state Republican Party chairman, acknowledged that one goal of his proposal was to attract conservative voters to balance liberal voters that might be drawn to the marijuana issue.\n\nDarren Schaefer, 45, who works unloading trucks in Bismarck, voted in favor of the proposal, noting: \u201cI can\u2019t go up to Canada and vote in their elections.\u201d\n\nU.S. HOUSE\n\nRepublican state Sen. Kelly Armstrong claimed North Dakota\u2019s open U.S. House seat after raising more than twice as much money as Democrat Mac Schneider, a former two-term state senator. In a campaign between two attorneys, the two agreed on fewer federal regulations and more control to local governments and disagreed on tax cuts and trade policies. Rob Bentz, 51, of Bismarck, an insurance claims adjuster, voted for Armstrong \u201cmostly because I didn\u2019t know much about the other candidate.\u201d\n\nSECRETARY OF STATE\n\nRepublican Al Jaeger\u2019s nearly three-decade run as secretary of state has been extended for another term, despite being snubbed by his own party at the state convention. The endorsed candidate, businessman Will Gardner, attacked Jaeger as behind the times. Gardner wound up quitting the race when an old conviction for a peeping-tom incident resurfaced \u2014 clearing the way for Jaeger to rise again as an independent. Democrat Josh Boschee, a state representative from Fargo, was looking to become the first Democrat to hold a statewide office since Roger Johnson resigned as agriculture commissioner in 2009.\n\nLEGISLATURE, ETC.\n\nRepublicans hold supermajorities in both chambers of the Legislature, and that wasn\u2019t likely to change Tuesday, even with a possible change at the top. Carlson was third behind Republican Michelle Strinden and Democrat Pamela Anderson in District 41.\n\nRepublicans to win re-election to state offices were Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem, Agriculture Commissioner Doug Goehring.

Baldwin won in her re-election bid against Republican Leah Vukmir. (Steve Apps/Wisconsin State Journal via AP)\n\nMADISON, Wis. (AP) \u2014 Democratic Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin cruised to a re-election win over Republican Leah Vukmir after successfully making the race about health care and her support for guaranteeing insurance coverage for people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nBaldwin, one of the Senate\u2019s most liberal members, beat Vukmir, a staunch supporter of President Donald Trump, by double digits, based on unofficial results.\n\nBaldwin won a number of counties that Trump took in 2016 when he narrowly carried Wisconsin by less than 1 point.\n\nBaldwin said in her victory speech Tuesday that her win sends a \u201cloud and clear message\u201d that people in Wisconsin want a senator who will stand up for them against special interests.\n\nBaldwin was an early target for outside conservative groups that spent millions attacking her over the summer. But Baldwin outraised Vukmir 5-to-1 and blanketed the airwaves with ads contrasting her support for the Affordable Care Act with votes Vukmir made in the state Legislature in favor of insurance companies.\n\n\u201cDemocrats, Republicans and independents sent a loud and clear message tonight that they wanted a senator who works not for the special interests, but someone who works for you,\u201d Baldwin said in her victory speech.\n\nVukmir campaigned as the underdog and urged Republicans who supported Trump to surprise the pollsters like they did in 2016.\n\nBut Democrats came through for Baldwin in a race that marked the first time in Wisconsin history both major party candidates for U.S. Senate were women.\n\nBaldwin had recent history on her side: In the last three midterm elections, no incumbent Wisconsin senator from the party not in the White House lost a re-election bid.\n\nBaldwin, 56, won her first local race at age 24 and was elected to the Senate in 2012, beating former Republican Gov. Tommy Thompson, in a year when former President Barack Obama was also on the ballot. Baldwin was the first openly gay person elected to the Senate.\n\nBaldwin and Vukmir disagreed on every major issue including health care, immigration, taxes, abortion, national security, gun control and criminal justice.\n\nStephenie Hamen, a 42-year-old artist from Sun Prairie, said she voted for Baldwin, in part as a vote for women\u2019s rights and a vote against Trump.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if it was to vent (against the president),\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a way to stand up for women as Americans and be heard. It\u2019s a scary time to be a woman in America. No matter what (Trump) says about being a white man in America, it\u2019s scarier for women and minorities. If the Republicans stay in power, we\u2019re writing a check for that party to do whatever they want. If we continue down that path we have no idea what\u2019s coming next.\u201d\n\nWhile Baldwin campaigned with former President Barack Obama and independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Vukmir rallied with Trump and forcefully supported his Supreme Court pick Brett Kavanaugh. Baldwin voted against his confirmation.\n\nBaldwin is a supporter of Sanders\u2019 \u201cMedicare for All\u201d bill and ran as a defender of the Affordable Care Act. Baldwin cast Vukmir, a nurse, as the potential deciding vote to repeal the law and its guarantees of insurance for people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nVukmir, 60, focused on Baldwin\u2019s handling of the opioid over-prescription crisis at the Tomah Veterans Affairs Medical Center, saying her inaction let veterans down. But the widow and parents of a veteran who died there has come out in support of Baldwin, cutting television ads to help her and undercutting Vukmir\u2019s criticism.\n\nBaldwin recounted the story of her childhood illness that made her an advocate for universal health coverage, while also speaking in detail for the first time about her mother\u2019s struggles with mental illness and prescription drug abuse. Baldwin said that has fueled her fight against opioid abuse.\n\n___\n\nFollow Scott Bauer on Twitter: https://twitter.com/sbauerAP\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "ELKTON, Md.

(AP Photo/Holly Hart)\n\nLINCOLN, Neb. (AP) \u2014 AJ Bush finally will get to play a game at Nebraska\u2019s Memorial Stadium.\n\nHis opportunity has come in a way he never could have imagined when he showed up in Lincoln fresh out of high school in 2014.\n\nHe left after two years to search for playing time, and he\u2019s found it at his fourth school, Illinois, where he won the starting quarterback\u2019s job for his only season there as a graduate transfer.\n\nAs much as Bush wants to not make a big deal out of his return Saturday, he knows it would be disingenuous to say it\u2019s not.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty special day,\u201d he said.\n\nBush then fell back on how it\u2019s another game, another chance for the Illini to win.\n\nAnd then.\n\n\u201cI know what kind of place that is,\u201d he said. \u201cI know what kind of great environment that is. To go back as the enemy, so to speak, is... ooh.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a lot of friends there. I\u2019ve got a lot of people I still talk to in Nebraska. A lot of the team now, some of them I came in with that are redshirt seniors. Others I hosted (on recruiting visits) and took under my wing when I was a sophomore and they came in as freshmen.\u201d\n\nBo Pelini was the coach whose staff recruited Bush to Nebraska out of Alpharetta, Georgia, and he redshirted his first year. Mike Riley took over for the fired Pelini in 2015, and Bush never rose higher than No. 3 on the depth chart.\n\nInstead of transferring to a Bowl Subdivision school and sitting out another season, Bush enrolled at Iowa Western Community College the day before classes started in 2016 and ended up playing 10 games.\n\nFrom there, it was on to Virginia Tech, where he backed up Josh Jackson last year. Hokies coach Justin Fuente asked Bush to change positions for this season, but Bush wanted to remain a quarterback. He graduated from Tech with a sociology degree in May and headed to Illinois.\n\nBush has been a good fit in offensive coordinator Rod Smith\u2019s dual-threat system. Bush ranks second among Big Ten quarterbacks in rushing, at 67 yards per game, and he\u2019s gone over 100 three times. He\u2019s completed 57 percent of his passes for 132 yards per game.\n\nThe 6-foot-4, 225-pounder heads to Nebraska off his best game, a 55-31 win over Minnesota. He ran for 127 yards and two touchdowns and completed 18 of 25 passes for 216 yards and two TDs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a special time when you get a chance to go back to a place you considered home, where you have history,\u201d Illini coach Lovie Smith said. \u201cYeah, there\u2019s a little bit of incentive, I\u2019m sure.\u201d\n\nThe game pits two struggling Big Ten West teams \u2014 Illinois is 4-5, Nebraska 2-7 \u2014 hoping to finish the season on a positive note.\n\nIt\u2019s a bit more than that for Bush, whose former teammates are looking forward to seeing him.\n\n\u201cAJ is a great guy,\u201d said offensive lineman Jerald Foster, who arrived at Nebraska with Bush. \u201cIt was hard to see when he left, but I knew he was going to do big things. His whole trip \u2014 Iowa Western to Virginia Tech then now to Illinois \u2014 it\u2019s wild. But he\u2019s a worker. I\u2019m happy that he\u2019s finally going to be able to come back to the stadium. It\u2019s going to be funny seeing him on the other side of the ball.\u201d\n\nLinebacker Mohamed Barry is a year younger than Bush and also from the Atlanta area, having grown up in Grayson, Georgia. Bush showed Barry around during his recruiting visit, and the two hit it off.\n\nBarry said he and Bush used to rib each other on the practice field and that he looks forward to getting reacquainted on the game field, hopefully in the Illinois backfield.\n\n\u201cWhen I get my opportunity,\u201d a smiling Barry said, \u201cI\u2019ll make him know that I\u2019m there.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "Sen.

Joe Manchin survived his toughest election campaign in a state that has declared itself loyal to Donald Trump, then implored the president to take the lead in halting the \u201ctoxic\u201d political talk that has divided the nation.\n\nThe Democrat won his second full term in the U.S. Senate, defeating Republican West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey.\n\nManchin took full aim at Trump in his victory speech. While Manchin has worked hard to cozy up to the GOP president, he didn\u2019t Tuesday night, urging a stop to \u201cthis absolute toxic rhetoric that\u2019s going on in this country.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to bring people together,\u201d Manchin said. \u201cMr. President, I want you to be the president of the United States, not the divided states.\u201d\n\nMorrisey had hoped to ride the attention in recent months from Trump, who had become popular in West Virginia for making broad promises to put coal miners back to work despite grim economic forecasts for the industry. The state gave Trump his largest margin of victory \u2014 42 percentage points \u2014 in 2016 despite registered Democrats far outnumbering Republicans.\n\nRoughly six in 10 West Virginia voters approve of the job Trump is doing, and about 4 in 10 said they strongly approve.\n\nTrump visited the state three times and Vice President Mike Pence twice in recent months to rally for Morrisey. But it wasn\u2019t enough.\n\n\u201cWhat West Virginia said loud and clear tonight: Mr. President, we want our senator, not your senator,\u201d said Manchin, who far outraised Morrisey in campaign contributions.\n\nIn his concession speech, Morrisey said \u201ctonight we may have fallen a little bit short.\u201d He told supporters that \u201cyour blood, sweat and tears mean a lot to me.\u201d\n\nMorrisey said he\u2019ll \u201ckeep fighting for West Virginia\u2019s soul\u201d in his final two years as attorney general.\n\nPortraying himself as loyal to his home state rather than party ideology, Manchin was the only Senate Democrat to vote to confirm U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. Morrisey said Manchin lacked leadership on the nomination, calling him \u201cSideline Joe\u201d for waiting until the very end to announce his vote.\n\nThe 50-year-old Morrisey called himself a true conservative while his campaign accused Manchin of being \u201ca dishonest Washington liberal who only acts bipartisan around election day ...\u201d\n\nManchin made maintaining health care protections for pre-existing conditions a major focus of his campaign and has hit Morrisey for joining a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nManchin also questioned Morrisey\u2019s past ties in Washington, D.C., as a lobbyist for the pharmaceutical industry \u2014 West Virginia leads the nation in the rate of drug overdose deaths. He also criticized Morrisey\u2019s roots in New Jersey, where he lost a 2000 congressional race.\n\nAmong voters, Democrat Everett Neville of Milton said he supported Manchin because \u201che\u2019s worked hard for West Virginia so far, even when he was governor.\n\nFormer Democratic state lawmaker Larry Linch of Clarksburg said he was concerned about Manchin\u2019s support of Kavanaugh but voted for Manchin anyway.\n\nManchin \u201ccauses me concern at times, but I\u2019ve known him for 25 years,\u201d Linch said. \u201cI know he kind of plays the field, but I think that\u2019s what we need, more of them jumping from one side to another and not being staunch along political lines.\u201d\n\nThe 71-year-old Manchin earned the backing of teacher unions after he supported them during a statewide strike earlier this year. He chided Morrisey for calling the strike \u201cunlawful\u201d and for saying his office was prepared to support authorities with legal remedies.", "Portland Trail Blazers guard Evan Turner, right, shoots as Milwaukee Bucks forward John Henson, left, defends during the first half of an NBA basketball game in Portland, Ore., Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2018.

(AP) \u2014 In search of his jump shot, CJ McCollum watched every single 3-pointer he took last season looking for what he lost.\n\nFortunately for the Portland Trail Blazers, he found it.\n\nMcCollum scored 40 points and Portland beat Milwaukee 118-103 on Tuesday night to hand the Bucks their second loss in 10 games this season.\n\n\u201cWhether I play well or not, I know how much time I spend preparing,\u201d McCollum said. \u201cThe only thing I saw was I had a lot of in-and-outs and I was shooting with a dead wrist. That was the only thing I noticed. I wasn\u2019t locking my wrist out, so I just tried to lock my wrist out.\u201d\n\nThe result was a dazzling performance against one of the NBA\u2019s best teams early this season.\n\n\u201cA lot of credit to CJ. He had a heck of a night,\u201d Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. \u201cAny time we made a bit of a run or felt like the momentum might be changing, McCollum hit a big shot.\u201d\n\nMcCollum, who entered shooting well below his career averages, went 17 for 26 from the field and added six assists.\n\n\u201cIt was tough,\u201d Milwaukee big man Brook Lopez said. \u201cHe made some huge plays and some tough shots that definitely were contested.\u201d\n\nEvan Turner had 16 points and 11 rebounds off the bench for the Blazers (8-3).\n\nGiannis Antetokounmpo led the Bucks with 23 points and nine rebounds. Lopez shot 6 for 10 from 3-point range and finished with 22 points.\n\nIn the third quarter, McCollum put on a show. He scored 19 points and made Bucks rookie guard Donte DiVincenzo fall down on a crossover move before hitting a basket, sending the crowd into a frenzy.\n\n\u201cWelcome to the league,\u201d Blazers center Jusuf Nurkic said. \u201cIt can be hard some nights. Put some ice and you\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n\nPortland led by 14 after three.\n\nPlay began at a fast pace that carried on throughout in a meeting between two of the top five offenses in the NBA. With only 16 foul shots combined, the game took less than two hours.\n\nPortland outscored the Bucks 33-31 in the first quarter as both teams shot better than 50 percent from the floor and the 3-point line.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nBucks: Now with Budenholzer in charge, Milwaukee is playing a much different style this season. After being a bottom-five team in 3-point attempts last season, the Bucks came in second in the NBA in 3-point tries with 41 per game. That included their 117-113 loss at Boston in which they put up 55 shots from beyond the arc. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s a lot,\u201d Budenholzer said. \u201cThe game is always evolving with teams, coaches and players trying to figure out what gives them the best chance. The skill of players now today is special, so trying to push that envelope.\u201d\n\nTrail Blazers: One of the biggest changes for the Trail Blazers this season has been utilizing Turner as the primary ball-handler on their second unit. The results have led to one of the best bench units in the NBA so far, ranking ninth in scoring. \u201cThe second unit comes in, their ball movement, their execution \u2014 they\u2019re playing with each other,\u201d Budenholzer said. \u201cThey take advantage if the defense overcommits or over-rotates. They\u2019re playing really well together. Evan Turner is kind of a great setup guy with that group. It\u2019s interesting to see how they\u2019ve changed a little bit and how it\u2019s working for them.\u201d\n\nUP NEXT\n\nBucks: At the Golden State Warriors on Thursday.\n\nTrail Blazers: Host the Los Angeles Clippers on Thursday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/tag/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "", "", "This photo shows the residence and office of the Archbishop of Agana in Guam on Wednesday, Nov. 7, 2018.

(AP) \u2014 Despite optimism about the economy, most Wisconsin voters in Tuesday\u2019s midterm election feared the nation is heading downhill amid worries about health care and other issues, according to a wide-ranging survey of the American electorate.\n\nOf the state\u2019s voters casting ballots for governor, U.S. Senate and members of Congress, 56 percent described the country as on the wrong track while 42 percent said things are going in the right direction, AP VoteCast found.\n\nHere\u2019s a snapshot of who voted and why in Wisconsin, based on preliminary results from AP VoteCast, an innovative nationwide survey of about 139,000 voters and nonvoters \u2014 including 4,709 voters and 579 nonvoters in the state of Wisconsin \u2014 conducted for The Associated Press by NORC at the University of Chicago.\n\n___\n\nRACE FOR GOVERNOR\n\nDemocrat Tony Evers unseated two-term Republican Gov. Scott Walker with a big boost from younger voters. Those under age 45 made up only one-third of the electorate but gave Evers 60 percent of their votes to 37 percent for Walker, who carried older voters by 54 percent to 45 percent.\n\nEvers also won handily among college graduates, while those without a college degree preferred Walker.\n\nWomen preferred Evers by 53 percent to 45 percent, while Walker won among men, 52 percent to 46 percent. Although Walker appeared to have a slight edge among white voters, it wasn\u2019t enough to overcome Evers\u2019 9-to-1 support among blacks.\n\nWhile Democrats and Republicans overwhelmingly backed their party\u2019s nominees, Evers prevailed among the crucial 13 percent who identified themselves as independents and moderates.\n\nSam Schmidt, 28, a Republican accountant from West Allis, said he voted for Walker because of what the governor has done to bring jobs to Wisconsin.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a big fan of the Foxconn acquisition,\u201d he said, referring to the deal to get the Taiwan-based electronics giant to build a manufacturing plant in Wisconsin. \u201cI heard that some of the Democratic nominees would\u2019ve tried to shoot it down and so that was a big deal in my vote.\u201d\n\nEvers voter Stephenie Hamen, a 42-year-old artist from Sun Prairie, criticized Walker for cutting school funding while giving businesses tax breaks. She said she was especially unhappy that he voiced support for health insurance coverage for pre-existing conditions while authorizing a lawsuit to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which guarantees such coverage.\n\n\u201cScott Walker has done nothing for our state,\u201d Hamen said. \u201cIt\u2019s time for a change.\u201d\n\n___\n\nRACE FOR SENATE\n\nYounger voters also were decisive in the re-election of Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, who was backed by nearly two-thirds of the under-45 age group. Republican challenger Leah Vukmir fared better with older voters, but even they were about evenly divided.\n\nVoters with a college education favored Baldwin by a solid 60 percent to 40 percent, while narrowly carrying voters without a college degree.\n\nBaldwin backer Danielle Moehring, 27, a scientist from Madison, said he believed the incumbent would protect health insurance guarantees for people with pre-existing conditions. Tony Merfeld, a 30-year-old Madison salesman, cast a straight Democratic ballot, praising Baldwin\u2019s positions on immigration and women\u2019s rights.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s the first openly gay person to serve in the Senate, and that\u2019s a hugely important point of pride,\u201d said Amy Franklin Bailey, 42, a Democrat from Green Bay. \u201cOnce upon a time, we were known as this progressive state. Her election was a testimony to that.\u201d\n\nVukmir\u2019s opposition to abortion drew support from Linda Phillips, 60, a nurse practitioner from West Allis.\n\n\u201cI think we have to especially protect life,\u201d Phillips said, adding that Vukmir was \u201cmore responsible and just a decent human being. She\u2019s also a fellow nurse.\u201d\n\n___\n\nTOP ISSUE: HEALTH CARE\n\nAbout twice as many Wisconsin residents labeled health care the top challenge facing the nation as those choosing any other issue. More than one-third said it was their primary concern.\n\n\u201cEveryone has a right to health care,\u201d said Abigail Walls, 31, a disabled resident of West Allis. \u201cIt is a basic human right to be able to, if you are sick, go to a doctor, get the medicines you need, get the care you need and not have to be saddled with a bill that\u2019s hundreds of dollars or hundreds of thousands of dollars.\u201d\n\nSchmidt said having government provide health care for everyone would be \u201cjumping the line.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy would you force anyone to buy anything?\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, 19 percent of voters considered immigration the top issue while 17 percent chose the economy and jobs, while smaller numbers picked the environment and gun policy.\n\nBy a 54-to-45 percent majority, voters supported raising taxes to boost public school funding in Wisconsin.\n\n___\n\nSTATE OF THE ECONOMY\n\nWisconsin voters had a positive view of the nation\u2019s economic prospects, with about two thirds saying it\u2019s in good shape while one third said it\u2019s going poorly.\n\nWalker supporters credited his policies such as lowering taxes and expanding broadband statewide, as well as the Foxconn deal.\n\n\u201cI think Wisconsin\u2019s doing well so why not continue,\u201d Schmidt said.\n\nWalker opponents said his easing of environmental regulations and other financial incentives for Foxconn and other financial incentives could be long-run losers for the state economy.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to gain jobs but ... it will end up hurting,\u201d said Don Edlund, 66, a retired lab worker from Sun Prairie.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP FACTOR\n\nAbout six in 10 voters said their feelings about President Donald Trump influenced their votes, while about four in 10 said he wasn\u2019t a factor.\n\nSchmidt praised Trump\u2019s attempts to renegotiate trade agreements with other countries, saying existing pacts with Mexico and China \u201chave been kind of one-sided where they would win all the trades.\u201d\n\nNicole Hassett, a 38-year-old waitress and single mother from Sun Prairie, said anger with Trump was a big reason for her straight Democratic ticket vote.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m tired of his lies. He\u2019s manipulative,\u201d Hassett said.\n\n___\n\nCONTROL OF CONGRESS\n\nTuesday\u2019s elections will determine control of Congress in the final two years of Trump\u2019s first term in office, and about two-thirds of Wisconsin voters said which party will hold control was very important as they considered their vote. About one-quarter of the voters said it was somewhat important.\n\nBailey said she previously voted for a Republican member of Congress because he had seniority and could benefit his district.

Tina Smith, D-Minn., speaks after winning a special election race to fill the vacated seat of former Sen. Al Franken during a election night event Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2018, in St. Paul, Minn. (AP Photo/Hannah Foslien)\n\nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 Minnesota voters have cleared Sen. Tina Smith to fill out the final two years of former Sen. Al Franken\u2019s term.\n\nSmith, a longtime Democratic power player who was appointed to take Franken\u2019s seat after he resigned, defeated Republican state Sen. Karin Housley on Tuesday in a special election.\n\nHousley, who had an energetic campaign and a name made famous by her husband\u2019s professional hockey career, had given Republicans hope they could win back the office that the party lost to Franken in 2008.\n\nSmith reflected on the whirlwind of campaigning and serving in the Senate since her January appointment.\n\n\u201cI am grateful to everyone in Minnesota who has put their faith in me,\u201d she told a raucous crowd of Democrats in St. Paul. \u201cWhen we started this effort 10 months ago, I said that I should not be underestimated. Tonight, we showed the country that Minnesota must not be underestimated.\u201d\n\nLess than four years after voters overwhelmingly gave Franken a second term, he was swept out of office when several women accused of him of sexual misconduct. His resignation in December triggered the contest between Smith and Housley.\n\nSmith will finish the term ending in 2020, when she could potentially stand for re-election.\n\nTuesday\u2019s election was a rarity in Minnesota, with two U.S. Senate seats on the ballot. Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar easily captured a third term over little-known state Rep. Jim Newberger.\n\nWith Franken\u2019s departure, Republicans jumped at the unexpected chance to reclaim an office they have not held since former Sen. Norm Coleman lost to Franken by 312 votes. Housley quickly emerged as the top GOP candidate, with her reputation as a fierce campaigner and a name recognition boost from her husband, former NHL star and Buffalo Sabres head coach Phil Housley.\n\nRepublican men, including former Gov. Tim Pawlenty and Reps. Tom Emmer and Erik Paulsen, quickly passed on the race, and Housley easily clinched the party\u2019s nod in an August primary.\n\nPublic polling showed the race close, but it never seriously figured in the nationwide battle for control of the Senate. Outside political organizations with their eyes on the Senate majority spent just a trickle in Minnesota, focusing millions instead on North Dakota, Wisconsin and other more promising states.\n\nPhillip Baum, 63, a self-described moderate conservative in Minnetonka, split his ticket Tuesday, backing Klobuchar in her Senate race but Republican Jeff Johnson for governor. Baum, a general contractor, said he was on the fence in the Smith-Housley race until Smith skipped a televised debate.\n\n\u201cThat sent the wrong message for me,\u201d Baum said. He voted for Housley.\n\nSarah Roth, 22, also of Minnetonka, went for Smith as part of a straight-Democratic vote. Roth described herself as a liberal and said she thought it was critical to change the balance of power in the country.\n\n\u201cI think the past couple of years, ever since President Trump has been in office, it has just been not the country that I am used to or that I thought I would be in.\u201d\n\nSmith got a head start in the race when Gov. Mark Dayton announced in December that he would appoint her to Franken\u2019s seat. Smith had been Dayton\u2019s lieutenant governor since 2015 and a longtime trusted aide, serving as his chief of staff after a career spent running campaigns and as a Planned Parenthood executive.\n\nAfter joining the Senate in January, Smith cultivated an image of a studious senator with sober, issue-focused ads on tackling pharmaceutical costs and vocational job training. She tried to avoid engaging with Housley throughout the campaign, including skipping a debate televised statewide and leaving Housley alone on stage. Smith said a busy campaign and Senate schedule got in the way, and the pair still had two debates.\n\nHousley bashed Smith for her absence and spent much of the campaign casting her as a longtime political insider with a hand in major flops during Dayton\u2019s administration, including the rocky launch of a new driver-registration system and pervasive abuse and neglect at senior centers statewide.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics .", "On election night Kim Schrier, facing camera, who is running for the 8th Congressional District, hugs a supporter at a victory party for Democrats, Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2018 in Bellevue, Wash.

(AP) \u2014 Kim Schrier has declared victory in a race for U.S. House in Washington state, becoming the first Democrat to win in the sprawling 8th District that stretches from Seattle\u2019s eastern suburbs to central Washington farm country and increasing Democrats\u2019 new majority in the U.S. House.\n\n\u201cCongress is broken, and people in the 8th District are ready for a community pediatrician to bring a dose of common sense to DC,\u201d Schrier said in a statement.\n\nThe Associated Press has not yet called the race, but Republican Dino Rossi posted a statement on his Facebook page conceding the race Wednesday night hours after the latest vote tallies were posted and Schrier maintained her lead with 53 percent of the vote.\n\nSchrier, a first-time candidate, and Rossi were vying for the seat being vacated by Republican Rep. Dave Reichert. Republicans have held the seat since it was created in the early 1980s.\n\n\u201cWhile this race did not end in the way you or I would have liked, I urge you to stay involved in the democratic process,\u201d Rossi wrote. \u201cWe all need to stay informed, get involved, and hold public officials accountable for the decisions they make.\u201d\n\nSchrier, a Type 1 diabetic, said she was moved to run after Reichert voted to repeal former President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law. She has made health care a signature campaign issue.\n\nIndependent pollster Stuart Elway said Schrier\u2019s lead in the open seat in the 8th Congressional District \u2014 a Republican-held district that Hillary Clinton won in 2016 \u2014 is \u201ca classic pattern of the national trend.\u201d\n\nRossi, a former state senator who had previous unsuccessful runs for governor and the U.S. Senate, had been leading in four of the district\u2019s five counties, but Schrier was dominating in King, which has twice as many votes as the other four counties combined.\n\nTina Podlodowski, chairwoman of the state Democratic Party, said Wednesday the numbers show that Democratic voters are moving to different parts of the state, \u201cparticularly into those suburbs and into the rural areas in the 8th.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think what you\u2019re seeing is a change from Seattle being the center of the universe for Democrats,\u201d she said.\n\nElway, who had a poll last month showing support for Rossi spike after the nomination hearing for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, said that \u201cthere was a real tremor in the force\u201d right at the time his poll had showed Rossi ahead by 10.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t sustain in the 8th District, but nationally that\u2019s what energized a lot of Republicans,\u201d he said.\n\nRepublican support stayed strong in the 5th Congressional District, where Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, who ranks fourth in House leadership, captured more than 55 percent of the vote over Democratic challenger, Lisa Brown, a former state Senate leader.\n\nThe district, centered in Spokane, has not elected a Democrat since former House Speaker Tom Foley last won in 1992.\n\nAnother targeted Republican incumbent, Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler, also won her re-election bid in southwestern Washington, beating Democratic challenger, Carolyn Long, a political science professor at Washington State University\u2019s campus in Vancouver.\n\nIn a written statement, Herrera Beutler thanked voters and called Long a \u201cworthy opponent in this election.\u201d\n\nLong said the campaign was more than just one person, it is \u201ca movement of folks from all over Southwest Washington that cannot and will not end with this election.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always worked to be a public servant who solves local problems and makes our region\u2019s priorities my priorities, and that will be my approach in this next Congress,\u201d she wrote.\n\nWith Schrier\u2019s win, there are now seven Democrats and four Republicans in the state\u2019s House delegation.

(AP) \u2014 Navajo Nation Vice President Jonathan Nez had a significant lead late Tuesday over his opponent in the race for the tribe\u2019s top post in an election marred by widespread reports of ballot shortages.\n\nNez had nearly double the votes of former two-term President Joe Shirley Jr. in the non-partisan race. It was unclear how election officials would factor in Navajos who were unable to cast ballots but Nez and Shirley said they didn\u2019t expect the outcome of the race to change.\n\nNez declared victory before a raucous crowd in the tribe\u2019s capital of Window Rock, saying he would start work Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the voice of the Navajo people wanting change,\u201d he said.\n\nShirley in a telephone interview did not explicitly concede defeat but said \u201cthe numbers speak for themselves.\u201d Nez was leading 39,783-20,146 with all precincts reporting.\n\nElections director Edbert Little said the tribe ordered more than enough ballots for the 110 precincts on the vast reservation that stretches into Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. He attributed the shortage to machines that rejected the paper ballots and said some voters had to be given replacement ballots.\n\nSteve Blackrock left a polling place near Pinon after writing down his information and waiting for an hour to see if more ballots would arrive.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a sad feeling knowing that you weren\u2019t able to participate in such an important day,\u201d he said.\n\nMore than 60 percent of the tribe\u2019s 98,000 registered voters cast a ballot in the presidential race.\n\nThe tribe\u2019s primary election in August drew a record 18 candidates, with Nez and Shirley emerging as the top two vote-getters. Outgoing President Russell Begaye came in fifth.\n\nNez and Shirley set priorities similar to those of past candidates: Serving the elderly, veterans and youth; developing the economy; building homes; extending water and electricity service to Navajos in need; and enticing business to a reservation with high unemployment that will worsen with a hit to one of its most important economic sectors.\n\nThe coal-fired Navajo Generating Station power plant near the Arizona-Utah border and the coal mine in the community of Kayenta that feeds it are set to close in late 2019. When those go, tribal officials say revenue from lease payments and coal royalties will drop 30 percent.\n\nBoth Shirley and Nez worried about the hundreds of jobs that also will be lost. The tribe was negotiating with a potential buyer for the power plant but the talks fell through. Peabody Energy, which owns the mine, led the push to find a successor for the power plant.\n\nOne last hope could be the Navajo Nation itself, which said last week that it\u2019s looking into buying the Navajo Generating Station.\n\nThe reservation has abundant coal, so tribal leaders have been hesitant to shy away from the coal industry even as the fuel falls out of favor with utilities nationwide.\n\nThe tribe owns a different coal mine in northwestern New Mexico and has a 7 percent stake in the power plant that it supplies with coal.\n\nNez has talked about finding another use for the plant, such as converting it to natural gas, or building a rail line to export coal. He said Tuesday he would try to avoid layoffs.\n\nPauline Butler voted in Leupp, Arizona, where tribal members were serving fry bread and stew at campaign tents. She said she was inspired by Nez being open to renewable energy and his drive to serve his people.\n\n\u201cHe certainly has the heart and soul to do this.\u201d\n\nNez said promoting self-sufficiency, tourism and Navajo-owned businesses, and revamping tribal laws are part of his equation to boost revenue. In his time as vice president, Nez was known as an advocate for health and wellness. He cites himself as an example, saying he became a long distance runner after he hit 300 pounds (136 kilograms).\n\nHe said he\u2019d leave economic development strategy largely to his vice president, Myron Lizer, who manages hardware stores on the reservation.\n\nJenny Buckinghorse voted for Shirley, citing a water rights case his administration settled in New Mexico, and water and power that was delivered to tribal members.\n\n\u201cYou can tell when somebody did something,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s evidence.\u201d\n\nShirley and his running mate, Buu Van Nygren, had a platform focused on business development, tourism and empowering small Navajo communities to impose local taxes, for example.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to go around with my head hung low,\u201d Shirley said late Tuesday. \u201cI told my team we shouldn\u2019t.

Colliton replaces Joel Quenneville who was fired on Tuesday. (AP Photo/Kamil Krzaczynski)\n\nCHICAGO (AP) \u2014 Jeremy Colliton knows all about Joel Quenneville\u2019s legacy with the Chicago Blackhawks.\n\nHe thinks he knows what to do, too.\n\n\u201cI have a huge amount of respect for Joel,\u201d Colliton said. \u201cThose are huge shoes to fill. I won\u2019t try to fill them. I\u2019ve got to be myself. And we\u2019re different people, so I\u2019ll bring different things to the table, different ideas to the table.\u201d\n\nChicago is hoping Colliton\u2019s fresh perspective will help the team get back on track after he became the 38th head coach in franchise history on Tuesday, taking over when Quenneville was fired after a wildly successful run with the Blackhawks.\n\nColliton goes from Chicago\u2019s American Hockey League affiliate in Rockford, Illinois, to the NHL\u2019s youngest head coach at 33. Blackhawks forward Chris Kunitz, defenseman Duncan Keith and goaltenders Corey Crawford and Cam Ward are older than Colliton, and defenseman Brent Seabrook also is 33.\n\n\u201cI have to earn their trust by them believing that I can help them win, that I can help them be better individually, that we as a staff can put together a plan so they can have success,\u201d Colliton said. \u201cSo if I can do that, there\u2019s no problem. It doesn\u2019t matter how old I am.\u201d\n\nColliton and Seabrook played alongside each other when they were kids. Colliton also made 57 appearances with the New York Islanders over five seasons, playing in his final NHL game in 2011.\n\n\u201cGrowing up, we sort of followed the same career path as kids,\u201d Seabrook said, \u201cplayed in the Western League against each other, played in the World Juniors together. When we were playing he had the same agent. A lot of connections there.\n\n\u201cSo it was nice to see him come back to North America last year and get the job in Rockford. Sounds like he did some good things in Europe and with Rockford last year.\u201d\n\nBut that\u2019s a far cry from the situation he faces now, replacing Quenneville after he coached Chicago to three Stanley Cup titles and nine playoff appearances.\n\nThe move comes in the wake of a winless three-game trip, extending Chicago\u2019s losing streak to five in a row heading into Thursday\u2019s home game against Carolina. The power play, a persistent problem, ranked 27th in the NHL heading into Tuesday. The Blackhawks (6-6-3) also are allowing an unseemly 3.73 goals per game.\n\n\u201cA decision like this isn\u2019t made on one game, one play, or one specific thing,\u201d general manager Stan Bowman said. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of a collection of things. Certainly the road trip was concerning. But I think even heading into that, there were some elements to our game where they weren\u2019t where they needed to be.\u201d\n\nAssistants Kevin Dineen and Ulf Samuelsson also were let go. Barry Smith, 66, moved from Chicago\u2019s front office to the bench as an assistant coach.\n\nThe 60-year-old Quenneville was the longest-tenured head coach in the NHL. He had another year left on a three-year contract extension he signed in 2016 that pays him $6 million per year, second highest in the NHL behind Mike Babcock in Toronto.\n\nWhenever Quenneville wants to get back to work, he likely will have plenty of suitors.\n\nThe former NHL defenseman has 890 wins in 22 years as a head coach with St. Louis, Colorado and Chicago. Scotty Bowman, Stan\u2019s father and a senior adviser with the Blackhawks, is the only man with more regular-season victories.\n\nQuenneville took over Chicago four games into the 2008-09 season, replacing Denis Savard after the Hall of Famer was let go by former general manager Dale Tallon. What followed was an unprecedented run for one of the NHL\u2019s Original Six franchises.\n\nJonathan Toews, Patrick Kane, Keith and Seabrook blossomed with Quenneville behind the bench, and the Blackhawks won the Stanley Cup in 2010, 2013 and 2015. They also made it to the conference finals in 2009 and 2014.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to be an icon in Chicago for the longest time, the great things he\u2019s done for this organization, winning three Stanley Cups, so that will never be forgotten,\u201d Kane said.\n\nThe pressure on Quenneville began to ramp up when Chicago was swept by Nashville in the first round of the 2017 playoffs after the Blackhawks finished with the best record in the Western Conference. Then they missed the playoffs entirely last season for the first time in a decade.\n\nThe change at coach turns up the heat on Bowman, who has made a couple of questionable moves that helped hasten the Blackhawks\u2019 decline. He traded Artemi Panarin to Columbus and Teuvo Teravainen to Carolina in part because of salary-cap issues, and each player has put up big numbers with his new club.\n\n\u201cI believe in this roster, I believe in Stan,\u201d team president John McDonough said. \u201cStan is meticulous, he\u2019s very thorough and when you break down free agents, when you break down trades, some work, some don\u2019t. You\u2019d like most to go your way and over time, they may. But his body of work is excellent.

Claire McCaskill on Tuesday, strengthening Republican control of the state and delivering a win for President Donald Trump.\n\nTrump, who won Missouri by nearly 19 percentage points in 2016, personally campaigned for Hawley twice in the week before Election Day, and Hawley ran as a strong ally of the president. He also relentlessly attacked McCaskill as too liberal to represent the increasingly conservative state.\n\n\u201cWhat the people of Missouri said tonight is that they want a senator who actually stands with the people of Missouri, who represents our values and represents our voice and will fight for us in Washington, D.C.,\u201d Hawley said during a victory speech in Springfield. \u201cAnd I will.\u201d\n\nHe pledged as the state\u2019s next senator to fight to secure the border with Mexico, advocate for \u201cpro-Constitution\u201d judges, \u201cbring back jobs from overseas to get wages growing,\u201d and stand up for farmers and small businessmen.\n\nMcCaskill\u2019s defeat leaves Auditor Nicole Galloway as the lone Democratic statewide officeholder in the state. She was appointed to her seat and won election Tuesday.\n\nRepublican U.S. Rep. Ann Wagner also eked out a victory against a Democratic challenger in the St. Louis suburbs, where support for Trump was more tepid.\n\nMissouri voters approved ballot measures to allow medical marijuana, gradually raise the minimum wage from the current $7.85 an hour to $12 an hour and change redistricting. But they denied a gas tax hike to help fix roads and bridges.\n\nRepublicans had long eyed McCaskill\u2019s seat as a prime pickup opportunity, but McCaskill survived near-political death before even as the state began trending increasingly red.\n\nShe embarrassed Republicans in 2012 when she used what she called \u201creverse psychology\u201d by running ads in the Republican primary decrying the conservative resume of the weakest candidate, former Rep. Todd Akin. He won and went on to lose to McCaskill in the general election after saying women\u2019s bodies can prevent pregnancy in cases of \u201clegitimate rape.\u201d\n\nDetermined not to let her outfox them again, GOP heavyweights this election plucked the Ivy-league educated Hawley and cleared the field for him.\n\nUnlike Akin, Hawley was less prone to political gaffes. He threw his support behind Trump\u2019s policies, while avoiding using or reacting to the president\u2019s incendiary rhetoric.\n\nHawley was the only statewide candidate in Missouri to receive more votes than Trump in 2016, when he won his bid for attorney general.\n\nMcCaskill during a Tuesday speech to supporters gathered in St. Louis thanked voters for allowing her to serve a long political career.

There was much talk of the possibility of success following a meeting in June between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, but in the months since there has been little to quiet skeptics who believe the North will never give up weapons it has described as necessary to counter a hostile Washington.\n\nPompeo was supposed to travel to New York on Thursday to meet with his North Korean counterpart, Kim Yong Chol. The U.S. State Department earlier said the top U.S. envoy for North Korea, Stephen Biegun, was to join Pompeo and Kim to discuss how to get to what it calls \u201cachieving the final, fully verified denuclearization\u201d of North Korea.\n\nSouth Korean presidential spokesman Kim Eui-kyeom said later Wednesday that his government doesn\u2019t believe U.S.-North Korea negotiations have completely broken down or \u201clost their momentum\u201d because of the postponement. Seoul\u2019s Foreign Ministry also expressed hope that the U.S. and North Korea can quickly reschedule a high-level meeting.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s presidential Blue House said the United States had informed it of the talks\u2019 postponement in advance. But the Blue House would not reveal the reason for the postponement, referring questions to the State Department.\n\nNews of the postponement came after North Korea\u2019s Foreign Ministry criticized the U.S. on Friday for its continued support of sanctions and hinted it may resume nuclear development.\n\nIn a statement, North Korea warned it could bring back Kim Jong Un\u2019s \u201cbyongjin\u201d policy of simultaneously advancing its nuclear arsenal and its economic development if the United States doesn\u2019t change its stance. The North stopped short of threatening to abandon nuclear negotiations with Washington.\n\nKoh Yu-hwan, a North Korea expert at Seoul\u2019s Dongguk University and a policy adviser to South Korean President Moon Jae-in, said a high-level meeting between the U.S. and North Korea immediately after the U.S. midterm elections was never realistic, especially when the North was in no mood to make any concrete concessions.\n\nTrump\u2019s engagement with North Korea in recent months was apparently timed to the midterms, but he will no longer agree to major meetings if there are no realistic expectations of progress in nuclear diplomacy, Koh said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Foster Klug and Kim Tong-hyung contributed to this report.", "LARAMIE, Wyo.

(AP Photo/Hannah Foslien)\n\nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 Democratic Rep. Keith Ellison survived an ex-girlfriend\u2019s abuse claim to become Minnesota\u2019s next attorney general after the allegation put the office in play for the GOP for the first time in half a century.\n\nEllison defeated Republican Doug Wardlow, who was a virtual unknown and would have been a heavy underdog but for the abuse claim against Ellison, which he strongly denied.\n\nHe rose to national prominence as the first Muslim elected to Congress and serves as deputy chairman of the Democratic National Committee. He talked of using the attorney general\u2019s office to resist President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda.\n\nThen his ex-girlfriend, Karen Monahan, accused him of dragging her off a bed during an argument in 2016. Monahan claimed to have a video, but never produced it. An investigation commissioned by Minnesota Democrats ruled the accusation was \u201cunsubstantiated.\u201d\n\nWardlow, and Republicans, called the investigation a whitewash, and hammered Ellison with the allegations throughout the campaign.\n\n\u201cThis was the challenge of a lifetime,\u201d Ellison said of his win.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have anything to add,\u201d he said when asked about the allegations. \u201cI just want to be the best Minnesota attorney general I can possibly be. That\u2019s all I want to do.\u201d\n\nThe seat opened abruptly in June when incumbent Lori Swanson launched a late bid for governor. Soon after Ellison declared and shortly before the primary, Monahan\u2019s claim surfaced.\n\nThough Ellison survived a crowded primary, the accusation dogged him, and other Democrats who refused to disavow him, throughout the campaign.\n\nSuddenly the virtually unknown Wardlow \u2014 who was a lawyer for a conservative Christian legal advocacy group \u2014 became a realistic contender. A Star Tribune/Minnesota Public Radio poll last month gave Wardlow a slight lead. The last GOP attorney general, Doug Head, served one term before losing the 1970 gubernatorial race to Democrat Wendell Anderson.\n\nEllison has been a national political figure since 2006, when, after serving two terms as a state representative, he became the first Muslim elected to Congress. A leader in the Bernie Sanders wing of the Democratic Party, Ellison deputy chairman of the DNC last year.\n\nPaul Taklo, 48, a designer in Minnetonka, said he voted for Wardlow. Taklo described himself as a conservative with libertarian beliefs who generally votes Republican.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t care for Ellison,\u201d Taklo said. \u201cIt\u2019s the liberal aspect of him.\u201d\n\nDavid Galle, 49, a lawyer in Minneapolis, backed Ellison in early voting Monday, calling him a strong supporter of Minneapolis and the state.\n\n\u201cWas I disheartened with some of the, you know, coverage? Yes, it certainly is messy, but as far as his approach to Minnesota versus his challenger, he was for me the clear choice,\u201d Galle said.\n\nDuring Wardlow\u2019s single term in the Minnesota House, he backed so-called right-to-work legislation to block unions from collecting mandatory dues. He also tried unsuccessfully to stop the state from setting up the MNsure health insurance exchange.\n\nAfter losing in 2012, he joined the Alliance Defending Freedom, leading its unsuccessful fight in a U.S. Supreme Court case that legalized same-sex marriage in 2015. He also litigated against letting transgender students use bathrooms of their choice and defended a Michigan funeral home that fired a transgender employee.\n\nEllison vowed to use the attorney general\u2019s office to fight Trump on immigration and other issues. While Wardlow presented himself as an apolitical alternative, he was recorded as saying at a private event that he wanted to fire 42 Democratic attorneys and replace them with Republicans. He said he misspoke.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics .", "Tampa Bay Lightning center Steven Stamkos (91) celebrates his goal during the first period of an NHL hockey game against the Edmonton Oilers on Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2018, in Tampa, Fla.

But the partisan balance of the Senate is already decided, and that decreases the intensity of the fight.\n\nVoters will choose Nov. 27 between Republican Cindy Hyde-Smith and Democrat Mike Espy, who advanced from a field of four candidates Tuesday. The winner gets the final two years of a six-year term.\n\nHyde-Smith has served in the Senate since April, when longtime Sen. Thad Cochran retired. Gov. Phil Bryant appointed her to serve temporarily until this month\u2019s special election is resolved.\n\nEspy was elected to the U.S. House in 1986 and served as U.S. agriculture secretary under President Bill Clinton in 1993 and 1994.\n\nAs of Wednesday, political action committees had spent about $1.8 million to support Hyde-Smith and roughly the same to support Espy, according to The Campaign Finance Institute , a nonprofit group that evaluates money in politics.\n\nMississippi Victory Fund, a PAC backing Hyde-Smith, said Wednesday that it is airing ads that call Espy \u201cthe liberal choice\u201d and say Espy \u201calready sided with the radical left\u201d by opposing Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination to the Supreme Court.\n\nHyde-Smith is endorsed by President Donald Trump and voted to confirm Kavanaugh. Espy told a business audience last week that he will put \u201cprinciple over party.\u201d He has said he would evaluate judicial nominees on their records and he had reservations about Kavanaugh\u2019s temperament to serve on the high court.\n\nOne of Mississippi Victory Fund\u2019s donors is Republican former Gov. Haley Barbour, who gave $25,000. Espy crossed party lines in 2007 to endorse Barbour for a second term as governor.\n\nEspy said in a news release Wednesday that he is challenging Hyde-Smith to three debates before the runoff.\n\n\u201cPublic discourse is important, now more than ever, and Mississippians deserve to hear our views and understand where we differ, whether it\u2019s on health care, education, or job opportunities,\u201d Espy wrote in a letter to her. \u201cThe stakes are just too high.\u201d\n\nHyde-Smith previously said she would consider debating Espy before a runoff, if her Senate schedule allows time. She declined to debate before Tuesday because she said she did not want to give a platform to Republican state Sen. Chris McDaniel. She said McDaniel was telling \u201cuntruths\u201d about her.\n\nMcDaniel finished third Tuesday and called on Republicans to unite behind Hyde-Smith. Mississippi last elected a Democrat to the U.S. Senate in 1982.\n\nHyde-Smith was in her second term as state agriculture commissioner when Bryant appointed her to the Senate. She is the first woman to represent Mississippi in either chamber of Congress, but no woman has been elected to the job from the state.\n\nEspy, if elected, would be the first black man to represent Mississippi in the Senate since Reconstruction.

(AP) \u2014 New Mexico is set to have a U.S. House delegation made up of all people of color after a historic win Tuesday by a Native American candidate, a victory by a five-term Hispanic incumbent and a too-close-to-call contest between two other minority candidates.\n\nIt\u2019s believed to be a first for any state with at least three House seats.\n\nDemocrat Debra Haaland defeated Republican Janice E. Arnold-Jones in the race for one of New Mexico\u2019s open U.S. House seats, becoming one of the first Native American women elected to Congress. She also beat Libertarian Lloyd J. Princeton in the district that includes Albuquerque, New Mexico\u2019s largest city.\n\nThe seat was open because incumbent Democratic U.S. Rep. Michelle Lujan Grisham opted to run for New Mexico governor. She won, meaning the reins of state government will pass from one Latina to another as termed-out Gov. Susana Martinez leaves office.\n\nMeanwhile, a hotly contested U.S. House race in southern New Mexico \u2014 between Republican Yvette Herrell, a member of the Cherokee Nation, and Democrat Xochitl Torres Small \u2014 remained too close to call late Tuesday. Torres Small is a granddaughter of Mexican immigrants.\n\nThat seat was open because the incumbent Republican, Rep. Steve Pearce, ran against Lujan Grisham.\n\nRegardless of who wins, the state\u2019s House delegation will be all people of color.\n\nDemocratic U.S. Rep. Ben Ray Lujan, who is Hispanic, won a sixth term representing northern New Mexico\u2019s 3rd District. He defeated Republican Jerald Steve McFall and Libertarian Chris Manning.\n\nLujan campaigned on efforts to advance immigration reform, expand Medicaid and address climate change. He has spearheaded efforts since 2014 to cut short Republican control of Congress as chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.\n\nLujan has long pushed for congressional candidates from diverse backgrounds, like Haaland and Democrat Sharice Davids, a member of the Ho-Chunk Nation who won a U.S. House seat in Kansas.\n\nHaaland is an enrolled Laguna Pueblo member. She was one of a three Native American women seeking to become among the first elected to Congress on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cNew Mexico made history tonight,\u201d Haaland said. \u201cI want to thank every single person who poured their heart and soul into this campaign. Congress has never heard a voice like mine, but when the 116th session of Congress begins, they will hear my voice.\u201d\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census, around 49 percent of New Mexico\u2019s population is Hispanic and about 11 percent is Native American. However, the voting participation of both populations historically has lagged behind whites.\n\nHaaland vastly outraised her opponents, and her win comes as President Donald Trump has repeatedly called U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren \u201cPocahontas\u201d over her claims the senator from Massachusetts has Native American ancestry.\n\nHaaland\u2019s candidacy gained national attention during the Democratic primary and excited Native Americans across the country. The Winslow, Arizona-born activist defeated a crowded field of mainly Hispanic candidates in a state with the largest percentage of Latino residents.\n\nHer primary victory came almost 50 years to the day after Robert F. Kennedy won South Dakota\u2019s Democratic presidential primary thanks to the Native American vote on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation.\n\nArnold-Jones sparked controversy after questioning Haaland\u2019s Native American heritage during a Fox News interview. The Republican said Haaland was a \u201cmilitary brat\u201d who didn\u2019t grow up on an American Indian reservation. Democrats denounced the comments as bigoted and ill-informed.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "Democrat Cunningham taps into uneasiness about Trump to stun Republicans and win US House seat in South Carolina", "1 of 4 Washington's Jaylen Nowell drives past a fallen Western Kentucky guard Taveion Hollingsworth during the first half of an NCAA college basketball game Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2018, in Seattle. (Dean Rutz/The Seattle Times via AP)\n\nSEATTLE (AP) \u2014 Washington coach Mike Hopkins described it as being in the \u201csandpit.\u201d The Huskies were at home, ranked to start the season for the first time in seven years, facing expectations and the anticipation of what they actually looked like.\n\nAnd they immediately proceeded to play an ugly, inconsistent first half and face a nine-point deficit.\n\n\u201cDown nine at home, pressure is on, everyone wants to see the team,\u201d Hopkins said. \u201cAnd these guys showed a lot of poise, a lot of resiliency. They stayed together.\u201d\n\nNoah Dickerson scored 16 of his 18 points in the second half, Jaylen Nowell added 17, and No. 25 Washington rallied from a nine-point halftime deficit to beat Western Kentucky 73-55 on Tuesday night.\n\nRanked in the preseason for the first time since 2011, the Huskies (1-0) slogged through an ugly first half of foul trouble and poor shooting, and leaned heavily on Dickerson to put away the Hilltoppers in the second half.\n\nLimited to just six minutes in the first half after picking up three fouls, Dickerson put together his own eight-point scoring spurt midway through the second half as the Huskies finally started to pull away. Dickerson made 6 of 8 shots and grabbed six rebounds.\n\nIt was the first extended action for Dickerson after sitting out Washington\u2019s first exhibition game and playing limited minutes in the second.\n\n\u201cI hadn\u2019t played in a while so it\u2019s fun to get back into things,\u201d Dickerson said. \u201cThe team was looking for me and I was getting back to doing what I was doing last year.\u201d\n\nHe also got the best of a matchup with highly-touted Western Kentucky freshman Charles Bassey in his college debut. The 6-foot-11 forward also struggled with early foul problems and finished with 11 points and 12 rebounds before fouling out in the final moments.\n\nJared Savage and Taveion Hollingsworth combined for 21 first-half points for the Hilltoppers, but were silent in the second half combining for just eight points. Savage led Western Kentucky (0-1) with 15 points and Hollingsworth had 14.\n\nThe Hilltoppers shot just 29 percent in the second half and finished with 16 turnovers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the points you give up as much as the energy you pump back into this arena,\u201d Western Kentucky coach Rick Stansbury said. \u201cWe knew this place is a hornet\u2019s nest and we just let them come back into the game.\u201d\n\nWashington started the second half on a 13-0 run, erasing the damage of Western Kentucky\u2019s 17-0 run to close the first half. David Crisp\u2019s 3-pointer gave Washington a 37-36 lead and the Huskies led 40-36 before Bassey\u2019s dunk finally got the Hilltoppers on the board.\n\nBut it was a key six-point possession midway through the half that finally gave Washington a cushion. Nowell scored and a flagrant foul was called on Matt Horton against Dickerson as the pair headed down court. Dickerson hit the free throws for the foul and on the ensuing possession scored underneath to give the Huskies a 56-48 lead. Dickerson later added a dunk off a loose ball and Washington\u2019s lead was 58-50 with 7:42 remaining. After another basket by Dickerson, Dominic Green\u2019s 3 pushed Washington\u2019s lead to 13.\n\nBASSEY\u2019S DEBUT\n\nBassey was the No. 8 recruit in country last year and arguably the highest-rated recruit ever to play for the Hilltoppers. His collegiate debut brought out 18 NBA scouts and he showed flashes of his promise at the next level in the second half.\n\nBassey made 5 of 9 shots and had a pair of blocks.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nWestern Kentucky: The Hilltoppers played without Auburn graduate transfer Desean Murray, who was suspended last week and did not make the trip west. Western Kentucky also had disciplinary issues with Hollingsworth and Josh Anderson, both suspended for one of the Hilltoppers\u2019 two exhibition games. Anderson played 13 minutes and didn\u2019t score before fouling out.\n\nWashington: The Huskies were 2 of 18 on 3-pointers in the first half and are not a good enough shooting team from the perimeter to be that reliant on shots from behind the arc. The Huskies attempted only 7 3s in the second half, hitting three.\n\nSTAT SHEET\n\nMatisse Thybulle finished with just nine points but filled the stat sheet in every other way.

(Dave Hunt/AAP Image via AP)\n\nCANBERRA, Australia (AP) \u2014 The Australian government on Wednesday warned it intends to block a Hong Kong and Chinese consortium\u2019s 13 billion Australian dollar ($9 billion) takeover bid for an energy infrastructure company because it conflicts with Australia\u2019s national interest.\n\nThe CK Consortium needed approval of Australia\u2019s Foreign Investment Review Board to take over APA Group, which owns more than 43,700 kilometers (27,100 miles) of gas pipeline in Australia.\n\nTreasurer Josh Frydenberg said he had told the consortium on Wednesday of his preliminary view that the takeover was not in Australia\u2019s interests. In practice, the decision to block the sale is final.\n\n\u201cI have formed this view on the grounds that it would result in an undue concentration of foreign ownership by a single company group in our most significant gas transmission business,\u201d Frydenberg said in a statement.\n\nThe Foreign Investment Review Board was unable to reach a unanimous recommendation, expressing concerns about the national interest implications of such a dominant foreign player in the gas and electricity sectors over the longer term, Frydenberg said.\n\nPeter Jennings, executive director of the government-established Australian Strategic Policy Institute think tank, had been advocating for weeks for the government to veto the sale on national security grounds.\n\n\u201cMy sense is that if the FIRB and the treasurer are taking national security considerations seriously into account, they should say \u2018no\u2019 to this particular proposed takeover,\u201d Jennings said in September.\n\nThe consortium is led by Hong Kong-registered Cheung Kong Infrastructure Group, better known as CKI. CKI and Chinese state-owned State Grid Corp. were in 2016 blocked on classified national security grounds from leasing for 99 years a 50.4 percent stake in Ausgrid, a Sydney electricity grid, for more than AU$10 billion.\n\nThat decision was made by Prime Minister Scott Morrison when he was treasurer.\n\nWhile reasons were not detailed, there was speculation that the consortium was blocked because Ausgrid included an electricity node that was connected to the secretive joint U.S.-Australian intelligence facility at Pine Gap in central Australia.\n\nJennings said the finding that the sale of APA to Chinese interests was not in Australians\u2019 interest was a \u201cno-brainer.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the takeover proceeded, we\u2019d have about 70 percent or more of electricity and gas infrastructure would be owned by either CKI, a Hong Kong company, or State Grid, a Chinese state-owned entity,\u201d Jennings said.\n\n\u201cI just think that\u2019s a risk that no country would really find acceptable,\u201d he added.\n\nIn 2016, China\u2019s state-run Xinhua News Agency criticized Australia for rejecting the Ausgrid bid along with Britain\u2019s recent move to delay a decision on a new nuclear power plant backed by Chinese investment. The agency said that although China\u2019s \u201cdramatic development, huge population and unique culture\u201d may cause concern for some countries, it could also result in \u201cChina-phobia.\u201d\n\nThe Chinese Embassy noted this was the second time in 2016 that the government has decided not to back applications by Chinese bidders to invest in Australia.\n\nMorrison had earlier blocked a Chinese-led consortium Dakang Australia Holdings from buying an 80 percent stake in Australia\u2019s largest private landholding, S. Kidman & Co. Ltd.\n\nThe embassy said the two decisions showed \u201ca clear protectionist tendency and would have serious impact on the enthusiasm of Chinese firms which want to come and invest in Australia.\u201d\n\nThe embassy did not immediately respond on Wednesday for a request for comment on the government\u2019s latest decision.\n\nIn 2015, President Barack Obama raised questions with then Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull after Australia allowed a Chinese company, Landbridge, to secure a 99-year lease over the strategically important Port of Darwin, which has become a U.S. Marines training hub in northern Australia. Turnbull said Australian defense and security officials determined the AU$506 million deal did not threaten national interests.\n\nThe Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, that fair trade watchdog, approved the APA deal in September on condition that the consortium reduced its gas market dominance in Western Australian state by selling some of its pipelines there. The bid was made in June.", "LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) \u2014 The Kentucky clerk who went to jail in 2015 for refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples lost her bid for a second term on Tuesday.\n\nKim Davis, the Republican incumbent, was defeated by Democrat Elwood Caudill Jr . in the election for clerk of Rowan County in northeastern Kentucky. Caudill won with 4,210 votes, or 54 percent, to 3,566, or 46 percent, for Davis.\n\n\u201cI believe that as a community we must continue to work together toward a more prosperous and cohesive Rowan County,\u201d Caudill said after his win, according to the Lexington Herald-Leader.\n\nDavis became a national figure when she stopped issuing marriage licenses days after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the U.S. Constitution guarantees same-sex couples the right to marry. The ruling overturned same-sex marriage bans nationwide.\n\nDavis cited her religious beliefs, saying she was acting under \u201cGod\u2019s authority.\u201d\n\nShe was released from jail when her staff issued licenses in her absence.\n\nRowan County voters denied Davis another term to a job that pays about $80,000 a year. She was elected to the clerk\u2019s job as a Democrat in 2014, but later switched parties because she said the Democratic Party \u201cabandoned her.\u201d\n\nShe didn\u2019t back away from her stand, saying at a fall campaign debate that she didn\u2019t treat anyone unfairly, and that she took an oath to uphold the constitution. She said she treated everyone equally because she quit issuing marriage licenses altogether.\n\nAt the same debate, Caudill said if elected he would treat everyone equally because he took an oath to uphold the law.\n\nCaudill criticized Davis for hiring her son to work for her. Davis defended the hiring, saying her son is someone she can trust to oversee human resources and handle the office computers.\n\nKentucky voters in 2004 overwhelmingly approved an amendment to the state Constitution defining marriage as between one man and one woman. But in June 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled the 14th amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees same-sex couples have the right to marry. The ruling overturned same-sex marriage bans nationwide.\n\nDays after the ruling, Davis stopped issuing marriage licenses.\n\nShe was sued by gay and straight couples, and a federal judge ordered Davis to issue the licenses. She refused and spent five days in jail.\n\nShe was released only after her staff issued the licenses on her behalf but removed her name from the form. The state legislature later enacted a law removing the names of all county clerks from state marriage licenses.\n\nA federal judge later ruled Kentucky taxpayers must pay the couples\u2019 legal fees of about $225,000.", "BOISE, Idaho (AP) \u2014 Republican Congressman Mike Simpson has won an 11th term representing Idaho\u2019s 2nd Congressional District.\n\nAnd the GOP\u2019s Russ Fulcher on Tuesday won Idaho\u2019s 1st Congressional District, defeating Democrat Cristina McNeil and six other candidates.\n\n\u201cI want to just promise you, fellow Republicans: Please know that I, that we, take this very very seriously,\u201d Fulcher said in a victory speech. \u201cYour Republicans will stand for the foundation of constitutional principles, and we will work together with honor to represent you and Idaho, both locally and on a worldwide stage.\u201d\n\nSimpson defeated Democratic challenger Aaron Swisher, a Boise economist, to retain the seat. Simpson currently sits on the powerful House appropriations committee and is the chairman for the Energy and Water Development Subcommittee, and he\u2019s voted multiple times in opposition to the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cIdaho will be incredibly well served by the team of Mike Simpson and Russ Fulcher in the U.S. House,\u201d said Idaho Republican Party Chairman Jonathan Parker. \u201cThey are champions for the people of Idaho, and they\u2019ll always stand up for Idaho values in our nation\u2019s capital.\u201d\n\nDuring his campaign, Simpson said he opposes amnesty programs for immigrants who are in the United States illegally. He also promised to promote the expansion of nuclear energy for the nation\u2019s energy needs, but said the country still will need traditional energy sources including coal.\n\nSwisher said he was running to create a livable minimum wage and end tax loopholes for wealthy CEOs.\n\nThe wins by Fulcher and Simpson mean Idaho\u2019s Congressional delegation will remain entirely Republican, as it has been for the last several years.\n\nFulcher grew up on a dairy farm in Meridian and spent several years working in the tech industry, for Micron and Preco Electronics. A staunch conservative, Fulcher has said he opposes Medicaid expansion because vulnerable Idaho residents need to \u201cget a sense of the ownership and obligation that comes with personal responsibility.\u201d\n\nStill, he said the current health care system needs improvement, and advocated changes including increased charity care and broader access to tax-free savings accounts that people could use to cover future medical expenses.\n\nMcNeil grew up in Mexico City, where her uncle Pedro Vazquez Colmenares was then the governor of the state of Oaxaca. She immigrated to the U.S. in 1995, and currently is a real estate agent with her own brokerage in Boise. She also volunteers with several other organizations including the Alliance for Justice and the Coalition for Immigrant Rights of Idaho.\n\nDuring her campaign McNeil said she supports Medicaid expansion and said Congress must work to increase competition in prescription drug pricing. She also promoted increased wages for Idaho school teachers, said she supports legalizing marijuana and promised to work to fund comprehensive improvements and maintenance for Idaho\u2019s infrastructure, including public roads and drinking water delivery systems.\n\nThe two were the front-runners in a crowded field which had six other people also vying for the seat. W. Scott Howard, a Libertarian from Post Falls, and a Letha man who legally changed his name from Marvin Richardson to Pro-Life several years ago were joined by four Independent candidates on the ballot: Gordon Counsil of Caldwell, Paul Farmer of Meridian, Natalie Fleming of Fruitland and write-in candidate Michael J. Rath of Saint Maries.\n\nFulcher replaces current GOP Rep. Raul Labrador, who opted to run for Idaho governor rather than seek re-election. Labrador lost in the primary.\n\nThe race for the 2nd Congressional District was quieter. Simpson has easily won every general election since 1998, with margins frequently topping 60 percent, and this race was expected by many to be no different.\n\nSimpson has been somewhat mixed in opinion when it comes to President Donald Trump, calling him \u201cunfit to lead\u201d when Trump was campaigning for office and sometimes criticizing particularly inflammatory tweets, calling the president\u2019s actions a distraction. Still, he recently said he\u2019s been \u201cpleasantly surprised\u201d by the president\u2019s record to date, particularly on the economy.\n\nSimpson has been a staunch opponent of the Affordable Care Act and says he opposes amnesty programs for immigrants who are in the United States illegally. He\u2019s also promised to promote the expansion of nuclear energy for the nation\u2019s energy needs, but said the country still will need traditional energy sources including coal, hydropower and natural gas.\n\nSwisher, a Boise resident and economist who worked at Clarivate Analytics before leaving to focus on his campaign full time, has written two books on the nation\u2019s economy and how current policies affect American families. He focused his campaign on creating \u201ca better deal for working-class Americans,\u201d saying anyone with a full-time job should be able to support themselves and meet basic needs \u2014 and promoting higher minimum wages to reach that goal. He also said he would push to protect and maintain public lands, work to prevent the damage of climate change and promote universal, single-payer health care.", "", "", "Republican Florida Governor-elect Ron DeSantis, center, waves to the supporters with his wife, Casey, left, and Republican Lt.

Jim Walsh of Aberdeen.\n\nRep. Mark Hargrove of Covington lagged in the District 47 with nearly 47 percent of the vote while Democratic challenger Debra Entenman had about 52 percent.\n\nAnd in the 5th District around Issaquah, Republican incumbent Paul Graves had garnered nearly 47 percent of the vote Tuesday to Democratic challenger Lisa Callan\u2019s 53 percent. Initial results also in that district showed Republican Chad Magendanz trailing Democrat Bill Ramos.\n\nDemocratic Rep.

Democrats currently hold a two-seat advantage in the House and a one-seat advantage in the Senate.\n\nRepublicans in the Senate were trying to keep three Republican-held districts where the Democratic aggregate vote in the primary was higher than the Republican vote: Sen. Mark Miloscia\u2019s seat, Sen. Doug Ericksen\u2019s seat and the open seat in the 26th District left by retiring Port Angeles Sen. Jan Angel.\n\nOn Tuesday, Democrat Emily Randall had nearly 51 of the vote in her race against Republican Marty McClendon in the 26th District.\n\nIn the 30th District, where Democrat Claire Wilson seeks to oust Miloscia of Federal Way, Wilson was leading with 53 percent of the vote.\n\nSen. Ericksen of Ferndale, however, was leading opponent Pinky Vargas with just over 50 percent of the vote.\n\nJustin Matheson, political director for the Senate Republican Campaign Committee said Tuesday night that they went into a lot of races in a defensive position and predicted they would be in good shape in a few of the closest races once more votes are counted.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be down one seat tonight and are disappointed to lose it,\u201d he said of the 30th District race. \u201cBut overall losing one is a pretty good scenario.\u201d\n\nIn another closely-watched contest, incumbent Republican state Sen. Joe Fain of Auburn is seeking re-election to his third term in District 47 under the cloud of a 2007 rape accusation that he has denied.

Joe Donnelly, D-Ind. (AP Photo/Darron Cummings)\n\nINDIANAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 On a night Democrats nationwide rode a blue wave of opposition to President Donald Trump to pick up governorships and take control of the House, their momentum stalled in the red state of Indiana.\n\nInstead, Republican Mike Braun\u2019s victory over the lone remaining Democrat elected statewide helped turn Indiana an even darker shade of crimson.\n\nThe multimillionaire auto parts magnate ousted Sen. Joe Donnelly, offering a strong indicator of where the state and its middle-of-the-road reputation could be headed politically.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t just Donnelly\u2019s defeat. Democrats also got trounced in two congressional races \u2014 one in northern Indiana, the other in the southern part of the state \u2014 where they held out hope for longshot wins.\n\nBraun told supporters during a victory speech that his election shows voters are sick of career politicians in both parties.\n\n\u201cThe theme of my campaign is that we need to take to Washington what works in the real world,\u201d he said.\n\nThe outcome is perhaps little surprise in an era where party affiliation is increasingly determined by factors like race, ethnicity, age and an urban vs. rural divide.\n\nIndiana is an agrarian and conservative state. But it wasn\u2019t long ago that voters here regularly elected conservative Democrats to the governor\u2019s office and Congress in significant numbers.\n\nJust look at Braun\u2019s own political history.\n\nAlthough he insists that he\u2019s a lifelong Republican, Braun long voted in Democratic primaries before switching over to the GOP several years ago before he was elected to his first of two legislative terms in the Indiana House.\n\nFor years, Donnelly has tried to walk a delicate line. After Trump won the state by 19 points, Donnelly spoke kindly of him, celebrated areas where they agreed but promised that he wouldn\u2019t be a rubber stamp. Rarely did he mention that he\u2019s a Democrat.\n\n\u201cIf you want someone to be with a political party 100 percent of the time, I\u2019m not that guy,\u201d Donnelly said in his final ad of the campaign. \u201cI\u2019m not about party.\u201d\n\nBut he\u2019s also had a target on his back ever since he unexpectedly won in 2012 after his opponent Richard Mourdock made incendiary comments about abortion and rape.\n\nAnd as the race tightened, Donnelly adopted some of Trump\u2019s rhetoric, angering members of his own party by attacking socialists and the \u201cradical left,\u201d while calling for a border wall with Mexico.\n\nThat appears to have hurt him in Democratic strongholds such as Marion County, where an \u201cunmotivated\u201d electorate did not turn out at levels he needed, said Andy Downs, a political science professor at Purdue University Fort Wayne.\n\n\u201cA lot of Democratic voters in Indiana understand moderates, understand governing from the middle,\u201d Downs said. \u201cBut when you pretty much hug Trump, you\u2019ve probably gone a little too far.\u201d\n\nRepublicans say the first-term senator talked a good game with his pro-Trump message. But they argued he was against the president when it counted, noting he opposed the GOP-led tax cut, legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act and the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nIn a midterm election cycle that largely turned on whether candidates were for or against Trump, Donnelly\u2019s balancing act just didn\u2019t work.\n\nMark Allan, 50, is a truck driver from Indianapolis who voted for Braun. He likes the way Trump is leading the country, particularly when it comes to immigration and foreign policy, and wanted to cast a ballot for someone who will vote for the president\u2019s priorities.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with Donnelly, but he\u2019s been on both sides of the fence,\u201d Allan said. \u201cWe need to keep the Senate Republican to support the agenda of Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nTrump, too, was heavily invested in the race in Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s home state. He campaigned aggressively against Donnelly, who he called \u201cSleepin\u2019 Joe.\u201d\n\nIn his concession statement, Donnelly said he was honored to serve the state.\n\n\u201cIt has been one of the greatest honors of my life to represent Indiana in the Senate,\u201d Donnelly said. \u201cI wish Mike the best, and I hope he makes every single Hoosier proud as our senator.\u201d\n\nBraun\u2019s victory is one few would have predicted last year when the two-term state lawmaker announced he would run in the GOP primary against two congressmen.\n\nBy leveraging his own fortune and loaning his campaign more than $10 million, he was able to deluge his Republican rivals under a wave of TV advertisements.\n\nBraun, who is worth somewhere between $37 million and $95 million, says Trump\u2019s success inspired him to run. On Tuesday he won after adopting a similar outsider businessman template.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t need this. I didn\u2019t need it either, by the way,\u201d Trump said at a rally for Braun near Indianapolis last week. \u201cBut we\u2019re having fun. You know why? We\u2019re winning.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "Incumbent Democratic Sen.

Martin Heinrich won re-election to a second term Tuesday in a three-way race against a Republican political newcomer and a Libertarian former governor.\n\nThe 47-year-old engineer and former congressman finished ahead of construction contractor Mick Rich and former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson.\n\nHeinrich\u2019s victory further solidified Democratic control over the state\u2019s Senate delegation. Democrats have won every Senate election in New Mexico since the final re-election in 2002 of Sen. Pete Domenici.\n\nHeinrich cast himself as a vigorous adversary of President Donald Trump\u2019s policies and campaigned on promises to defend federal health care and retirement programs.\n\nAcknowledging victory Tuesday evening, Heinrich said voters \u201cresponded to a vision that was actually positive and was about unifying our state.\u201d\n\nHe said the top priority for his second term will be initiatives that can improve the state economy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still going to be working for our (federal) laboratories and military bases, for our outdoor recreation economy,\u201d Heinrich said. \u201cI\u2019m going to be working to protect Social Security and Medicare.\u201d\n\nDemocrats swept a long list of statewide political contests, including the race to succeed Republican Gov. Susana Martinez. Beyond New Mexico, Republicans retained majority control of the Senate, as they ousted Democratic incumbents in Indiana, North Dakota and Missouri.\n\nHeinrich recently became an advocate for decriminalizing marijuana, co-opting one of Johnson\u2019s signature Libertarian issues against government interference. He derided Johnson\u2019s proposals to slash federal spending on Medicare, Medicaid and the military.\n\nRich ran unsuccessfully on his reputation as a businessman while embracing Trump \u2014 echoing the president\u2019s dire warnings about a migrant caravan approaching the United States from Mexico \u2014 and voicing anti-abortion sentiments.\n\nIn 2012, Heinrich won his first Senate race after the retirement of Democratic Sen. Jeff Bingaman.\n\nNew Mexico\u2019s senior senator is Democrat Tom Udall, whose second term ends in 2020. He has not indicated whether he will seek re-election.\n\nUdall and Heinrich have been prominent figures in Democratic resistance to Trump\u2019s effort to shrink national monuments and unravel environmental protections.\n\nTuesday\u2019s election adds a new defeat to Johnson\u2019s political resume, after two bids for president under the Libertarian banner in 2012 and 2016. Johnson served two terms as a Republican governor starting in 1994.\n\nOn Tuesday, he congratulated Heinrich without renouncing his dedication to the Libertarian cause.\n\n\u201cOurs is a difficult task,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThird-party candidates have a critical role to play in our increasingly partisan political and policy landscape.\u201d\n\nJohnson\u2019s 2016 campaign for president won 9 percent of the vote in New Mexico, as Hillary Clinton cruised to victory in the state with an 8 percentage point margin over Trump.\n\nAlbuquerque-based pollster Brian Sanderoff said Heinrich\u2019s hold on the Senate seat never truly came into contention.\n\n\u201cHis opponents were underfunded, couldn\u2019t get their message out,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "", "SAN DIEGO (AP) \u2014 Isaiah Pineiro scored 25 points and grabbed 12 rebounds and San Diego rallied in the second half to beat Weber State 83-66 in coach Sam Scholl\u2019s debut in Tuesday night\u2019s season opener.\n\nTrailing 32-25 at halftime, Olin Carter III\u2019s 3-pointer sparked a 13-3 run capped by Alex Floresca\u2019s jumper for a 44-39 Toreros lead with 14:12 left and San Diego led by as many as 18 the rest of the way after shooting 65 percent from the field in the half.\n\nIsaiah Wright and Carter scored 13 points apiece with Wright dishing eight assists.

(AP Photo/Kin Cheung)\n\nZHUHAI, China (AP) \u2014 A Chinese state-owned company says it is developing a stealth combat drone in the latest sign of the country\u2019s growing aerospace prowess.\n\nThe CH-7 unmanned aerial vehicle also underscores China\u2019s growing competitiveness in the expanding global market for drones. China has won sales in the Middle East and elsewhere by offering drones at lower prices and without the political conditions attached by the U.S.\n\nThe CH-7\u2032s chief designer Shi Wen says the aircraft can \u201cfly long hours, scout and strike the target when necessary.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery soon, I believe, in the next one to two years, (we) can see the CH-7 flying in the blue skies, gradually being a practical and usable product in the future,\u201d Shi told The Associated Press.\n\nShi said manufacturer Chinese Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation plans to test fly the drone next year and begin mass production by 2022. He said the drone will likely be sold abroad but had no information on potential clients.\n\nA model of the aircraft is being displayed at this week\u2019s Zhuhai air show in southern China, a biannual event that showcases China\u2019s latest advancements in military and civilian aviation.\n\nWith a wingspan of 22 meters (72 feet) and a length of 10 meters (33 feet), the swept-wing CH-7 is the size of a combat aircraft and its single engine can propel it at roughly the speed of a commercial jet airliner.\n\nThe U.S., Russia and France are also developing stealth drones, while Israel has long been a leader in the UAV field.\n\nHowever, low prices and a willingness to transfer technology have endowed China with a \u201cstrong position,\u201d in the UAV market, said Phil Finnegan, director of corporate analysis at the Teal Group Corp. in Fairfax, Virginia.\n\nThe U.S. has been extremely cautious about selling its higher-end unmanned system, even to NATO member states, opening up an opportunity to China in the export market, said Justin Bronk, an export on such technologies at the Royal United Services Institute for Defense and Security Studies in London.\n\n\u201cIt would represent an area of Chinese arms export offerings which no other country offers,\u201d Bronk said.\n\nAlongside its development of stealth fighters and commercial passenger jets, China has advanced rapidly in the development of UAVs, which have a relatively lower technological entry cost. Sales have also been boosted by the fact that China is not a signatory to the Missile Technology Control Regime that restricts exports of missiles and other unmanned weapons systems.\n\nThe numbers of drone programs unveiled in China in recent years has been \u201cdizzying,\u201d said Sam Roggeveen, director of the international security program at Australia\u2019s Lowy Institute.\n\nWhile the CH-7\u2032s ultimate effectiveness remains to be determined, if exported, it would \u201cmark another step-change for China, which has traditionally not offered its cutting-edge technology to foreign customers,\u201d Roggeveen said.\n\nAcross the Middle East, countries locked out of purchasing U.S.-made drones due to rules over excessive civilian casualties are being wooed by Chinese arms dealers, now the world\u2019s main distributor of armed drones.\n\nThe sales are helping expand Chinese influence across a region crucial to American security interests and bolstering Beijing\u2019s ambitions to lead in high-tech arms sales.\n\nWhile the U.S. still holds a technology advantage, China wins on price. The fact it is willing to sell the CH-7 abroad could indicate the technology is less than cutting edge, given China\u2019s desire to guard its technological edge in such areas, said Ron Huisken, a regional security expert at Australian National University.\n\nChina\u2019s exports also underscore the growing pervasiveness of drones in modern warfare, even without strong international agreements on where and how they can be used.\n\n\u201cOne wonders what nasty surprises are in store as countries more casual about how they use drones and less strict about training standards get their hands on them,\u201d said Huisken.\n\nAlso appearing again at this year\u2019s Zhuhai show was China\u2019s homebuilt J-20 stealth fighter, which outwardly resembles the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor in service with the U.S. military.\n\nIt was joined by the Chinese J-10B fighter with vectoring thrust, featuring an engine equipped with a hinged nozzle. Vectoring thrust technology allows planes to direct their propulsion, giving it more flexibility in maneuvering, and the substation of Chinese-made WS-10 engines for those imported from Russia appears to mark a new milestone for the domestic defense industry.\n\nThe jet fighters on display thrilled spectators. For many, the performances demonstrated China\u2019s burgeoning aerospace industry and growing confidence in its technology.\n\n\u201cI think it is pretty awesome,\u201d said Xie Dongni, a marketer for an information technology company.\n\n\u201cI might not a plane specialist, but I can feel the way China is changing.

(AP Photo/Kevin McGill)\n\nNEW ORLEANS (AP) \u2014 Supporters of a constitutional amendment ending split jury verdicts are celebrating their victory in what was a rare alliance of conservative and progressive organizations working together to end a practice with roots in post-Civil War racism.\n\nThe amendment takes effect Jan. 1 and will leave Oregon as the only other state allowing split verdicts. It reverses a Jim Crow-era practice that made it easier to imprison non-whites by allowing as few as 10 members of a 12-member jury to convict defendants in felony cases not involving death sentences.\n\nThe amendment was pushed through the Louisiana Legislature by Sen. J.P. Morrell, a New Orleans Democrat. It received more than the necessary two-thirds approval in the House and Senate and drew strong support from factions rarely on the same page: On the right, supporters included the Christian conservative Louisiana Family Forum and Americans for Prosperity, a conservative organization funded by billionaire Charles Koch.\n\nOn the left, supporters included the American Civil Liberties Union and Innocence Project New Orleans.\n\nSupporters of the change noted the wide-ranging support the measure received as they celebrated their victory Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWe have shown the nation that the people they are used to seeing fight against each other will come together for the common cause of freedom. That we will fight side by side for the liberty of our neighbors,\u201d said Norris Henderson, state director of the Unanimous Jury Coalition.\n\nThe state director for Americans for Prosperity said people in the state can feel better about the justice system after the amendment\u2019s passage.\n\n\u201cThis amendment protects the rights of the accused and ensures that any verdict handed down is truly beyond a reasonable doubt. Passage of this amendment is proof that no matter the ideology, we can come together and change our society for the better,\u201d John Kay said.\n\nSome district attorneys and their supporters in the Legislature opposed the measure, not wanting to make prosecutors\u2019 jobs more challenging.\n\nNot convinced by arguments that current law could result in the conviction of innocent people, Ed Burkett, the district attorney in rural Sabine Parish, said the amendment would enable a single juror to prevent conviction in a case where evidence proves guilt. \u201cJustice is also not served when guilty people are not convicted,\u201d Burkett said in an interview.\n\nBut Anne Ferris, a 43-year-old New Orleans resident who voted for the amendment Tuesday, said that wasn\u2019t a good enough reason to allow non-unanimous verdicts to continue.\n\n\u201cThere should be a unanimous verdict whenever there\u2019s a jury trial. If there\u2019s not a unanimous verdict then it\u2019s a hung jury,\u201d she said. \u201cIf it makes it harder, sorry.

At left is his wife, Jennifer Siebel Newsom and at right his son Hunter, 7. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg)\n\nSACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) \u2014 Within months of becoming San Francisco mayor in 2004, Gavin Newsom decided his hometown would ignore the law and issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples.\n\nThe move rocketed the then-36-year-old Democrat to national fame and instantly made him a polarizing figure in a fraught debate that gripped and divided the nation.\n\nNow he\u2019s poised to once again take a position of national prominence, this time as the leader of California\u2019s resistance to President Donald Trump.\n\nNewsom, 51, was elected California governor on Tuesday, easily defeating Republican John Cox. It\u2019s a prize he\u2019s eyed for a decade and gives him a platform to spar with Trump and advance the ambitious policies he champions, including universal health care and an aggressive effort to improve services for impoverished children.\n\n\u201cWe say about California: We\u2019re America\u2019s coming attraction,\u201d Newsom said while campaigning last week. \u201cThe future happens here first.\u201d\n\nWeeks earlier, riding in the back of his campaign bus through the Central Valley, Newsom went over his life story and pushed back on the persistent narrative that\u2019s dogged him since his political career started \u2014 that he had a privileged upbringing and rode the coattails of his father\u2019s wealthy and connected friends.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t deny his father\u2019s friends are wealthy and connected. Bill Newsom was close to Gordon Getty, who inherited a multi-billion-dollar oil fortune and invested in Newsom\u2019s first business, and has been lifelong friends with Gov. Jerry Brown, who also was governor during Newsom\u2019s youth.\n\nBut Newsom insists that narrative ignores his struggles as a child with dyslexia raised by a mother who held multiple jobs and moved all the time, and a father who, despite his connections, faced constant financial pressures. His parents separated when Newsom was young.\n\n\u201cI grew up very differently,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody thinks I was born at 18 or 20.\u201d\n\nHe was privileged to know the Gettys, he said, and to get experiences he\u2019d never otherwise have, like foreign vacations they paid for as a teenager. But it wasn\u2019t his whole reality.\n\n\u201cGoing on vacation once a year was not my life 360 of the other days,\u201d he said. \u201cMy life was working. Mom crying at night because she\u2019s struggling and stressed out.\u201d\n\nWith help from Getty and other investors, Newsom was in his 20s when he opened his first business, a San Francisco wine store called PlumpJack. The PlumpJack portfolio would grow to include boutique hotels, wineries, bars and restaurants mostly in Northern California, and Newsome would become a millionaire.\n\nHe has largely stepped away from the business and turned over management to his younger sister, Hilary. As governor, he said he\u2019ll forego all decision-making but won\u2019t sell his interests.\n\n\u201cThese are my babies, my life, my family. I can\u2019t do that. I can\u2019t sell them,\u201d Newsom said.\n\nThat decision poses potential ethical concerns for the new governor. Hospitality businesses are heavily regulated by the state and could provide opportunities for interest groups to try to curry favor by, for example, renting facilities at Newsom\u2019s properties for events.\n\nWhile campaigning, Newsom said after the election he would outline how he will guard against any ethical issues related to his business holdings.\n\nNewsom got his start in politics with the help of California Democratic power broker Willie Brown, then San Francisco\u2019s mayor. He appointed Newsom to the city\u2019s Parking and Traffic Commission and later, at the urging of longtime local Democratic lawmaker and operative John Burton, to a vacancy on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. Burton and Newsom\u2019s father were childhood friends.\n\n\u201cI thought that he\u2019d serve the city quite well,\u201d Burton said. \u201cAnd life\u2019s proven I\u2019m a prophet.\u201d\n\nNewsom was San Francisco\u2019s youngest mayor in a century when just three months into his term he jumped into the gay marriage debate.\n\nHe was credited with advancing the civil rights of gays and lesbians more than a decade before the U.S. Supreme Court legalized same-sex nationwide in 2015.\n\nBut he also was faulted by many Democrats for foisting the issue into the 2004 presidential campaign, long before same-sex unions were widely accepted outside liberal coastal enclaves. Republican George W. Bush was re-elected president that November.\n\nThousands of couples were married in San Francisco before the state Supreme Court shut it down.\n\nNewsom made his decision as mayor a central pitch to voters \u2014 proof that he has the courage to do the right thing. As mayor, he also was known for his homelessness and health care initiatives. And for scandal in his personal life.\n\nThe \u201cCare Not Cash\u201d program reduced cash assistance for people living on the streets and replaced it with housing and services. \u201cHealthy San Francisco\u201d provides basic health care to everyone in the city, even those living in the country illegally, funded largely by businesses and the city\u2019s general fund.\n\nBut he had a sometimes rocky relationship with the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. His ambitious pledge to end homelessness never came to fruition and that problem now is more pronounced than ever.\n\nAfter his glamorous marriage to prosecutor-turned-Court TV personality Kimberly Guilfoyle ended in divorce, it came to light he\u2019d had an affair with an aide who, at the time, was married to Newsom\u2019s campaign manager and close friend. Newsom said he learned from the episode and accepted responsibility for his actions.\n\nDuring the gubernatorial primary, several of Newsom\u2019s opponents briefly seized on it as a campaign issue. At a debate, Republican Travis Allen said: \u201cIf you can\u2019t trust Gavin with his best friend\u2019s wife, why would you trust him with your state?\u201d\n\nNewsome responded that he was honest about the affair, \u201cI was open about it. I apologized for it.\u201d\n\nGuilfoyle went on to work for Fox News and now is dating Donald Trump Jr., the president\u2019s son. Newsom married Jennifer Siebel, an actress and filmmaker whose work has focused, among other things, on gender stereotypes. They have four children.\n\nNewsom focused his campaign on opposition to Trump. He also opposed a state ballot issue to rescind a gas tax increase earmarked to improve infrastructure. Cox made the repeal a focus of his campaign.\n\nNewsom also pledged to build 3.5 million housing units by 2025 to provide more options for poor and middle-class families, a promise many experts find overly ambitious, and to extend health coverage to the uninsured, including immigrants living in the country illegally.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Newsom memorized his speeches and all the facts and figures that went in them, a necessity because of dyslexia, a disorder that makes it difficult to read and comprehend written words.\n\n\u201cI just have to quadruple prepare, which is just not easy,\u201d Newsom said, then added: \u201cBut look, I\u2019m only here because I do all this.\u201d\n\nDuring his bus tour, he demonstrated the laborious coping mechanism he\u2019s developed to retain what he reads. He underlines important information, then goes back and rewrites key points in his own hand. He dates the page and stores them in binders separated by subject matter.\n\n\u201cYou will never find my fifth-grade teacher (to) say, \u2018I always knew he was going to be governor,\u2019\u201d he joked. \u201cThere\u2019s no teacher in my life \u2014 they\u2019re all just sitting here going, \u2018How the hell did that happen?\u2019\u201d\n\nFor most of Newsom\u2019s political career, he\u2019s been followed by questions about what many believe is his ultimate goal: president. On the campaign trail, Newsom said he\u2019s not considering that possibility, though he acknowledged few believe him, not even his friends.\n\nThey\u2019ve seen him as presidential timber since he was a high school student wearing a suit and tie to school.\n\n\u201cI have no interest in anything to do with any of that,\u201d Newsom said of a run for president. \u201cI mean, I don\u2019t know how else to say it. It\u2019s just anathema to anything I\u2019m interested in in life.\u201d", "A supporter, left, gives a thumbs up to Bob Hugin, the Republican candidate in the Senatorial race in New Jersey, as he takes a call during an election night party, Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2018, in Mountainside, N.J.

Bob Menendez overcame doubts about his character by winning enough votes from the state\u2019s suburban and younger voters for a third term, according to a wide-ranging survey of the American electorate.\n\nAs voters cast ballots for U.S. Senate and members of Congress in Tuesday\u2019s elections, AP VoteCast found that even some voters who don\u2019t think he\u2019s honest looked past the Democrat\u2019s corruption scandal to support him.\n\nHere\u2019s a snapshot of who voted and why in New Jersey, based on preliminary results from AP VoteCast, an innovative nationwide survey of about 139,000 voters and nonvoters \u2014 including 3,822 voters and 667 nonvoters in the state of New Jersey \u2014 conducted for The Associated Press by NORC at the University of Chicago.\n\n___\n\nRACE FOR SENATE\n\nWomen favored Menendez by a 3 in 5 margin, enough to overcome a split of the vote among men.\n\nBlacks voters were another key to the Democrat\u2019s victory, giving Menendez enough of their support to offset his Republican challenger Bob Hugin\u2019s slight advantage among white voters.\n\nSuburban voters who made up a majority of New Jersey\u2019s voters also gave Menendez an edge.\n\nMenendez, who faced a 2015 federal corruption indictment that ended in a mistrial, won even though only a quarter of the voters said they thought he was honest and trustworthy. He even got support from one-third of the voters who didn\u2019t trust him.\n\nSamantha Bohr said she backed Menendez because she thinks he will protect health care and work for immigration reform.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day it was a hard choice,\u201d said Bohr, of Parsippany-Troy Hills, New Jersey.\n\nVoters under 45 also favored Menendez by a 6 in 10 margin while those ages 45 and older were more closely split.\n\n___\n\nCONTROL OF CONGRESS\n\nTuesday\u2019s elections determined control of Congress in the final two years of Trump\u2019s first term in office. Almost all of the state\u2019s voters said that was an important factor when they considered their vote, with 7 in 10 saying it was very important.\n\nNew Jersey\u2019s suburbs were a key battleground for House control with two open seats vacated by veteran Republicans, and a pair of competitive races in the state\u2019s 3rd and 7th districts.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP FACTOR\n\nTwo-thirds of New Jersey voters said Trump played a role in their decision while one-third said the president wasn\u2019t an influence.\n\nAlmost half of voters cast their ballots to express opposition to the president while about one in five said they voted to express support for Trump.\n\nConnie Stoerk, who lives in Parsippany-Troy Hills, said the votes she cast for Democratic candidates were a direct response to Trump \u2014 despite the accusations against Menendez. \u201cI can\u2019t vote for Hugin ... because he would vote for Trump,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can\u2019t take the risk of Trump. We just can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nA majority had negative views of Trump, with six in 10 saying they disapprove of how he is handling his job.\n\n\u201cHe creates so much bad tensions between people, in relationships. At work, you can\u2019t even talk politics anymore and I think that\u2019s not right,\u201d Stoerk said.\n\nIn the U.S. Senate race, Menendez often pointed out that his opponent had been a prominent donor and supporter of the president. But Hugin said during the campaign that his views didn\u2019t mirror the president and he was \u201cno Trump Republican.\u201d He promised to stand up to Trump when they disagree.\n\n___\n\nTOP ISSUE: HEALTH CARE\n\nHealth care was the top issue facing the nation for most New Jersey voters followed by the economy and immigration.\n\nRonald J. Hadley, 58, of Parsippany-Troy Hills, New Jersey, said he embraces Trump\u2019s crackdown on illegal immigration and voted Republican so the president will have the support in Congress to continue his policies. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to take this country back. We were built by immigrants. There\u2019s no reason we can\u2019t thrive with immigrants \u2014 legal immigrants!\u201d Hadley said.\n\nMaking sure people have \u201cdecent health care\u201d as well as standing up for immigrants were the top issues for Virginia Gollin, of Hopatcong, New Jersey, who described herself as a moderate Republican up until she switched parties. Her parents immigrated to the country from Italy and she said she views Trump as sowing \u201cfear, xenophobic fear.\u201d\n\n___\n\nSTATE OF THE ECONOMY\n\nNew Jersey voters had a pretty positive outlook on the economy, with two-thirds saying it\u2019s in good shape. But just about the same amount said the country was on the wrong track.\n\n___\n\nSTAYING AT HOME\n\nIn New Jersey, 6 in 10 registered voters who chose not to vote in the midterm election were younger than 45. A wide share of those who did not vote \u2014 about two-thirds \u2014 did not have a college degree. About as many nonvoters were Democrats as Republicans.\n\n___\n\nAP VoteCast is a survey of the American electorate in all 50 states conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago for The Associated Press and Fox News. The survey of 3,822 voters and 667 nonvoters in New Jersey was conducted Oct. 29 to Nov. 6, concluding as polls close on Election Day. It combines interviews in English or Spanish with a random sample of registered voters drawn from state voter files and self-identified registered voters selected from opt-in online panels. Participants in the probability-based portion of the survey were contacted by phone and mail, and had the opportunity to take the survey by phone or online. The margin of sampling error for voters is estimated to be plus or minus 2.2 percentage points. All surveys are subject to multiple sources of error, including from sampling, question wording and order, and nonresponse.

(AP) \u2014 It only took an election with no major statewide races and six constitutional amendments to draw an almost-record number of North Carolina voters to the polls.\n\nA larger percentage of voters cast their ballots in a nonpresidential election year than had been seen since 1990, when a major U.S. Senate race was being fought. They voted in legislative, judicial and congressional races, along with the ballot questions.\n\nAmong the bigger-picture issues were whether Democrats deserved more power and voter satisfaction with Republican governance in Raleigh and Washington. And the results were a mixed bag, with the failure of the two constitutional amendments that drew the most Democratic opposition, but GOP victories for at least two of three congressional races viewed as competitive.\n\nState Democrats raised mammoth sums of cash, buoyed by Gov. Roy Cooper\u2019s call to \u201cBreak the Majority\u201d of the GOP in both the House and Senate this decade. Appraisals of state Republican control stretched to a state Supreme Court race, where the Democrat won, but the issue she\u2019s challenged previously as a lawyer \u2014 photo identification required for voting \u2014 became part of the state constitution.\n\nLEGISLATURE\n\nDemocrats broke the GOP\u2019s veto-proof margins in the state House and may do the same in the Senate, pending the results of a handful of races in that chamber.\n\nThey got at least eight additional seats in the House, giving more leverage to Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper to pass his initiatives, such as expanding Medicare and curbing school choice options. As Election Day moved into Wednesday, Democrats had won three of the six seats needed to break the veto-proof margin in the Senate, but led in three more.\n\nDemocrats angry with Republican policies on public schools, taxes, the judiciary and social issues had focused on this year\u2019s election as a step toward regaining General Assembly control. All General Assembly seats were on the ballot \u2014 120 in the House, where Republicans held 75 seats, and 50 in the Senate, where the GOP had 35 seats before the election.\n\nCooper raised at least $7 million for the state Democratic Party, which passed money along to the party\u2019s legislative candidates. Republican campaigns have highlighted the strong economy, passing lower taxes and increasing school spending and teacher raises. While many House Republican incumbents got outraised by Democratic challengers, Senate Republicans fared better.\n\nCONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS\n\nVoters said no Tuesday to two amendments shifting power to legislators from the governor, while an amendment requiring a photo identification to vote and three others passed.\n\nThe other amendments that passed lower the cap on income tax rates; expand crime victims\u2019 rights and enshrine the right to hunt and fish.\n\nThe six amendments Republican lawmakers submitted to voters filled the vacuum of having no races for governor or U.S. Senate. Groups for or against the amendments raised well over $20 million, according to campaign finance reports.\n\nCooper, the Democratic Party and allied groups pushed to defeat all six. The state GOP supported all six, but former Republican governors and the conservative Americans for Prosperity have come out against one or two individual amendments.\n\nAPPEALS COURTS\n\nNorth Carolina voters both supported a constitutional amendment for a photo identification for voting and a state Supreme Court candidate who had fought the requirement in court.\n\nDemocrat Anita Earls, a longtime civil rights attorney from Durham, raised record campaign money and garnered national attention as she defeated Republican incumbent Justice Barbara Jackson.\n\nEarls led the Southern Coalition for Social Justice when she helped sue over legislative and congressional districts and challenged a voter ID law.\n\nJackson was seeking a second eight-year term but got waylaid by the late entry of another registered Republican, Raleigh attorney Chris Anglin. He had been a registered Democrat until just before he filed. Democrats now hold five of the seven Supreme Court seats.\n\nCONGRESS\n\nAs Election Day began, Democrats were hopeful that they would flip three Republican-held congressional seats, but those hopes faded as the votes were counted.\n\nOne seat remained uncalled \u2014 the south-central 9th District anchored by Charlotte. But Democrat Dan McCready conceded the race late Wednesday to Republican Mark Harris, who upset current Rep. Robert Pittenger in the GOP primary in May. Harris led McCready by less than 1,900 votes with all precincts reporting.\n\nIn the 13th District, covering parts of Greensboro and points west to Iredell County, first-term Republican Rep. Ted Budd was able to fend off a challenge by Kathy Manning. In the Raleigh-area 2nd District, three-term GOP Rep. George Holding retained his seat over Democrat Linda Coleman.\n\nNine other incumbents won, while 3rd District Rep. Walter Jones Jr. faced no ballot opposition.\n\nRepublicans would keep their 10-3 seat advantage in the state\u2019s congressional delegation if Harris is declared the winner.\n\nEARLY VOTING\n\nMore North Carolina voters went to the polls for this election than in any non-presidential election since 1990, when Republican Jesse Helms and Democrat Harvey Gantt fought for Helms\u2019 U.S. Senate seat.\n\nWith all precincts reporting Wednesday, the State Board of Elections web site showed 52.4 percent of North Carolina voters \u2014 or over 3.7 million people \u2014 cast a ballot in this election, compared to almost 62 percent in 1990.\n\nEarly in-person voting levels smashed the previous record high for midterms in 2014 with several days to spare.\n\nThe state board counted about 2 million people voting at early-voting sites statewide before they closed Saturday after 18 days of early voting, compared to 1.1 million in 2014, when 10 days of early voting occurred. Overall 2014 election turnout was 44 percent, or 2.9 million voters.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Gary D. Robertson contributed to this report.", "RENO, Nev.

Barr hosted a rally with President Donald Trump, and McGrath campaigned at a high school gym with former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nOlivia Renfro, a Centre College student, hugged McGrath and cried after her concession.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m feeling pretty devastated, I really believed in her campaign. I really thought she would pull out a win,\u201d said Renfro, who canvassed for McGrath during the campaign. But Renfro said she was inspired as a woman to run for office someday.\n\nBarr leaned heavily on the district\u2019s rural counties, winning Madison County, Lexington\u2019s neighbor, with 59 percent of the vote. President Donald Trump came to campaign for Barr in Madison County\u2019s largest city, Richmond, in mid-October.\n\nMcGrath had hoped to flip a congressional district that has switched party control five times since 1978. But some voters said they liked the way things were going and stuck with Barr.\n\n\u201cWe are doing good now, so why change things up?\u201d said Elizabeth Blythe, a 25-year-old from Georgetown in Scott County. \u201cI think it\u2019s good to keep things the same right now.\u201d\n\n___\n\nLovan reported from Richmond, Kentucky.", "PORTLAND, Ore.

Kay Ivey defeating Democratic challenger Walt Maddox for a full term, all six of the state\u2019s congressional Republicans won re-election easily, and amendments favored by conservatives won approval with ease.\n\nThe result means more of the same in the state\u2019s balance of power: No Democrat will hold statewide office in Montgomery, and Alabama\u2019s nine-member delegation to Washington includes seven Republicans.\n\nHere are some of the key races:\n\nLIEUTENANT GOVERNOR\n\nRepublican state Rep. Will Ainsworth defeated Democrat Will Boyd in the race for lieutenant governor, a job that mainly involves presiding over the state Senate.\n\nAinsworth was first elected to the Alabama House four years ago. The North Alabama resident billed himself as Christian conservative who will set a higher ethical standard at a Statehouse tainted by repeated scandals in recent years.\n\nBoyd is a minister from Florence. He has made several unsuccessful bids for public office, including last year when he sought the Democratic nomination for the seat now held by Jones.\n\nATTORNEY GENERAL\n\nRepublican Attorney General Steve Marshall, an appointee who previously served as a county prosecutor in north Alabama, defeated Democrat Joseph Siegelman, the son one of the best-known names in state politics, former Gov. Don Siegelman.\n\nMarshall, 53, took over in February 2017 after Luther Strange was appointed to the U.S. Senate. He endured personal tragedy earlier this year when his wife Bridgette took her own life in June just weeks before the Republican runoff.\n\nSiegelman, 30, is a Birmingham attorney who was making his first bid for public office. While many voters might recognize his name because of his father, they also might attach some unwanted baggage to it. Don Siegelman, Alabama\u2019s last Democratic governor, served time in federal prison after being convicted in a bribery conspiracy.\n\nCONGRESS\n\nAlabama\u2019s congressional Republicans pulled off a clean sweep over Democratic challengers, and it wasn\u2019t close in any district.\n\nIn the most closely watched race, Rep. Mike Rogers of Saks easily defeated Miss America Mallory Hagan of Opelika as he sought a ninth term in the solidly GOP District 3. The district tilts Republican, so the outcome wasn\u2019t a surprise; Rogers won re-election two years ago by a more than 30-point margin.\n\nVoters in the 1st District of southwestern Alabama handily elected Rep. Bradley Byrne of Fairhope to a third full term as he defeated Democratic nominee Robert Kennedy Jr. of Mobile.\n\nRepublican Rep. Martha Roby of Montgomery turned back Democrat Tabitha Isner in District 2 of southeastern Alabama, and 11-term Republican Rep. Robert Aderholt of Haleyville won re-election in District 4 of north central Alabama by defeating Democrat Lee Auman, a camp manager from Union Grove.\n\nFour-term Republican Rep. Mo Brooks of Huntsville defeated Democrat Peter Joffrion, a former Huntsville city attorney, in the 5th District of the Tennessee Valley. In the 6th District of metro Birmingham, GOP Rep. Gary Palmer won a third term against Democrat Danner Kline, an early leader of Alabama\u2019s craft beer industry.\n\nRep. Terri Sewell, who didn\u2019t have GOP opposition, remains the only Democrat in the state\u2019s House delegation.\n\nSUPREME COURT\n\nAlabama\u2019s nine-member Supreme Court remains all-Republican, with an acolyte of ousted chief justice Roy Moore now in the same job.\n\nSupreme Court Associate Justice Tom Parker turned back Democratic challenger Bob Vance Jr. to be elected chief justice of the state\u2019s highest court. Parker will take over the position previously held by Moore, a mentor.\n\nParker was elected to the Supreme Court in 2004. His campaign appealed to social conservatives and emphasized his hope of one day overturning U.S. Supreme Court decisions such as the one that legalized abortion.\n\nVance is a circuit judge in Jefferson County. He was endorsed by six former chief justices, including three Republicans, but couldn\u2019t pull off a win in a state where Republicans hold an overwhelming majority.\n\nIn the only other contested Supreme Court race, Birmingham attorney Jay Mitchell defeated Jasper lawyer Donna Wesson Smalley for the Place 4 position.\n\nCONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS\n\nVoters approved a constitutional amendment regarding the display of the Ten Commandments in public schools and government buildings.\n\nThe proposal would allow displays in public schools and government buildings in a way that \u201ccomplies with constitutional requirements\u201d such as being posted with historical documents.\n\nVoters also approved an amendment to add anti-abortion language to Alabama\u2019s 1901 constitution specifying that the state recognizes the \u201crights of unborn children.\u201d The measure does not impact abortion access unless Roe v. Wade, the U.S. Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion, is reversed.\n\nSTATE SCHOOL BOARD\n\nVoters decided three races for the Alabama State Board of Education.\n\nIn District 2, Auburn City School Board President Tracie West defeated Democrat Adam Jortner, who teaches history at Auburn University.

(Bettina Hansen/The Seattle Times via AP)\n\nSEATTLE (AP) \u2014 A Washington state initiative that would charge the nation\u2019s first tax on carbon emissions to tackle climate change trailed in early returns Tuesday in the state\u2019s costliest initiative campaign.\n\nMeanwhile measures tightening gun regulations and making it easier to prosecute police for negligent shootings passed.\n\nThe fight over whether to make polluters pay for their carbon emissions was closely watched nationwide. Experts said Initiative 1631 would show that states can take climate action even if the Trump administration doesn\u2019t, and create momentum for other states.\n\nVoters roundly rejected a carbon tax two years ago. But a broad coalition of environmental, community, labor and other groups tried again with a new pollution charge \u2014 technically levied as a fee \u2014 and a spending plan to steer revenues toward projects aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n\u201cWe know we\u2019re in a hole. We\u2019re not ready to make a call until we see those numbers,\u201d said Nick Abraham, a spokesman for the carbon-fee supporters said late Tuesday. The initiative was losing 44 percent to 56 percent.\n\n\u201cWe were up against the most money in state election history. Regardless whether we win or lose, this problem isn\u2019t going anywhere.\u201d\n\nThe opposition campaign sponsored by the Western States Petroleum Association, an oil industry group, outspent carbon-fee supporters by roughly 2-to-1. The No on 1631 campaign spent about $30 million, or twice the $15 million supporters spent.\n\nDana Bieber, a spokeswoman with that campaign, declared victory Tuesday night for \u201cworking families, consumers, small businesses and family farmers.\u201d\n\nIn other ballot measures, a measure tightening state gun laws including enhanced background checks for people buying semi-automatic rifles won. Initiative 1639 had 60 percent of the vote.\n\n\u201cWashington state made history by passing the most comprehensive gun violence prevention measure in state history,\u201d Stephen Paolini, campaign manager for Yes On 1639, said in a statement.\n\nThe measure would also increase the minimum age to buy semi-automatic rifles from 18 to 21, add a waiting period to get those weapons and add firearm storage provisions.\n\nVoters approved a measure designed to make it easier to prosecute police for negligent shootings. Initiative 940 is designed to improve police training in de-escalation tactics and eliminate a requirement that prosecutors prove officers acted with malice to get a conviction in negligent shootings.\n\nA measure backed by the beverage industry that would block local governments from taxing soda and other groceries had a solid lead in early returns. Initiative 1634 would prohibit local governments from imposing new taxes on soda or grocery items and was part of an effort by the industry to stop the expansion of taxes on soda and other sweetened beverages.\n\nThe election was marked by big industry spending on major statewide initiatives with oil companies breaking state spending records to try to defeat the proposed carbon pollution fee.\n\nOpponents flooded mailboxes and ran TV ads warning of increased gasoline and energy costs while proponents, who included Seattle rapper Macklemore and the actor Leonardo DiCaprio, urged voters to support clean energy and other projects.\n\nThe beverage industry targeted Washington state as part of a nationwide effort to stop the expansion of taxes on soda.\n\nA campaign sponsored by the American Beverage Association spent more than $20 million on Initiative 1634, which would block local governments from imposing new taxes on soda or grocery items. The industry earlier won bans on new, local soda taxes in California, Arizona and Michigan.\n\nThe Coca-Cola Co., PepsiCo, Inc. and Dr. Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. gave the bulk of money in support. Opponents raised about $33,000.\n\nUnder the measure, cities and counties in Washington would be prohibited from taxing soda or food products. The measure wouldn\u2019t prevent the state Legislature from doing so. Seattle\u2019s tax on soda and sugary beverages, approved last year, would remain in effect but couldn\u2019t be expanded.\n\nProponents said the tax hurts small businesses and working people. Opponents said it prevents local governments from raising money and allows corporate interests to create state policy.\n\nMeanwhile, the National Rifle Association and some law enforcement groups lined up against the gun measure, Initiative 1639.\n\nOpponents said the measure strips the constitutional rights of 18- to 20-year-olds and that forcing gun owners to lock away their firearms could put them in danger.\n\nSupporters said the goal is to curb gun violence and make schools and communities safer by putting safeguards in place. They say making the checks as thorough as the one used for buying a pistol will help ensure that weapons are kept out of dangerous hands.\n\nInitiative 940 is designed to improve police training in de-escalation tactics and eliminate a requirement that prosecutors prove officers acted with malice to get a conviction in negligent shootings.\n\nThe initiative\u2019s sponsor, De-Escalate Washington submitted I-940 to the Legislature early this year after collecting nearly 360,000 signatures. Lawmakers passed I-940 and a compromise version of the legislation preferred by lawmakers, activists and police groups. The state Supreme Court ruled that I-940 in its original form would go on the November ballot while the compromise would not.\n\nInitiative sponsors have said they are focused on getting the measure passed and expect to work with police groups and others on compromise language.\n\nAfter voters rejected a carbon tax in 2016 and lawmakers failed to pass carbon tax legislation earlier this year, a coalition of environmental, community and tribal group collected thousands of signatures to put a carbon fee measure on the ballot.\n\nUnder the measure, large polluters such as fuel producers and natural gas plants would pay an escalating fee on fossil fuels used or sold in the state or electricity generated within the state, starting at $15 per metric ton in 2020.\n\nAn estimated $2.3 billion raised in the first five years would fund a wide range of programs aimed at cutting greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nProponents found financial backing from environmental groups, tech leaders, Microsoft\u2019s co-founder Bill Gates and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.", "South Dakota voters reject measure to raise state tobacco tax by $1 per pack of cigarettes for tech school affordability", "", "Fantastic freshmen help No. 4 Duke blow out No. 2 Kentucky\n\n1 of 8 Duke guard Tre Jones (3) next to Kentucky forward Nick Richards (4) during the first half of an NCAA college basketball game at the Champions Classic in Indianapolis on Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2018.

LOUIS (AP) \u2014 Missouri voters on Tuesday approved a measure that would give them access to medical marijuana, joining a long list of states that allow the once-forbidden drug to be used for medicinal purposes.\n\nThree separate and unrelated issues were on the ballot providing for medical marijuana in Missouri, thanks to three successful petition drives. But just one passed: Amendment 2.\n\nThe medical marijuana ballot proposals were among several issues confronting Missouri voters, who also approved three other measures: A gradual increase of the state\u2019s minimum wage from the current $7.85 an hour to $12 an hour; creation of a new position of nonpartisan demographer to draw state House and Senate boundaries; and a reduction in the amount of experience necessary to run bingo games.\n\nBut voters rejected a measure that would have raised the current 17-cent-per-gallon gas tax 10 cents per gallon.\n\nThe approved medical marijuana measure allows patients with cancer, HIV, epilepsy and other conditions access to the drug. Missouri becomes the 31st state to approve medical marijuana, although Utah also had a measure on the ballot Tuesday.\n\nMissouri legislative researchers have estimated that more than $100 million worth of medical marijuana could be sold annually.\n\nExperts had predicted a court battle if more than one of the measures passed.\n\nAmendment 2, from a coalition of patients, doctors and veterans called New Approach Missouri, emphasized the value of medical marijuana for veterans. Post-traumatic stress disorder is among the qualifying, and a 4 percent sales tax goes to a newly-created fund for health and care services for veterans.\n\nNew Approach Missouri spokesman Jack Cardetti said that in passing Amendment 2, voters \u201cshowed that increasing health care treatment options for patients and supporting veterans are bipartisan Missouri values.\u201d\n\nStacy Carey, 57, a jewelry maker from Chesterfield, voted for Amendment 2 because, she said, she\u2019s personally seen the value of medicinal marijuana.\n\n\u201cMy dad had cancer and smoking marijuana helped him,\u201d Carey said. \u201cIt kept him alive because he was nauseous and couldn\u2019t eat until he had the marijuana. That\u2019s what changed my mind.\u201d\n\nThe competing constitutional change proposal that failed, Amendment 3, was financed almost exclusively by Brad Bradshaw, a Springfield personal injury attorney and medical doctor. Its funding mechanism called for a 15 percent tax on the retail sale of marijuana as well as a wholesale tax on the sale of marijuana flowers and leaves. Those funds would have been used to create a new state institute to research \u201cpresently incurable diseases.\u201d\n\nOpponents were critical of a provision giving Bradshaw broad powers over the new research institute, including choosing its board members.\n\nProposition C, which also failed, would have imposed a 2 percent tax on medical marijuana sales to be used for veteran services, drug treatment, early childhood education and public safety in cities with medical marijuana facilities. It was supported by Missourians for Patient Care, a political action committee that did not disclose its financial supporters.\n\nThe minimum wage measure, Proposition B, will require the wage to rise to $8.60 an hour in 2019 and gradually increase to $12 an hour by 2023.\n\nAmendment 1, the so-called \u201cClean Missouri\u201d ballot measure, requires the demographer to draw legislative boundaries based on the 2020 Census using criteria intended to achieve partisan fairness. Maps will be submitted for approval to bipartisan commissions, which will have less leeway than in the past to draft their own plans.\n\nThe measure also limits lobbyist gifts to lawmakers, makes legislative records open to the public, lowers campaign contribution limits for legislative candidates and lengthens the time lawmakers must wait after leaving office before becoming lobbyists.\n\nThe bingo measure, Amendment 4, reduces to six months the term of membership in an organization before a person can run a bingo game. The current requirement is two years.\n\nThe gas tax proposal, Proposition D, would have used money created by the 10-cent-per-gallon gas tax hike to repair roads and bridges and help fund the Missouri State Highway Patrol.\n\nThe defeat wasn\u2019t a complete shock since Missouri voters have a long history of rejecting tax increases. Missouri\u2019s gas tax has not changed since 1996. In 2014, Missouri voters rejected a proposed sales tax for roads. They also defeated a transportation tax plan in 2002.", "LAFAYETTE, La.

Sohn said he believes the case can be made for damages exceeding $200 million, when projecting career contract values for the NFL\u2019s premier defensive tackles.\n\nFloyd carried that potential, but he played in only 44 games, the last on Sept. 11, 2016.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s trying to figure out what\u2019s next for him in life,\u201d Sohn said. \u201cThat\u2019s not an easy thing, because he had no interest in ceasing to play football.\u201d\n\nFloyd was drafted by the Vikings out of Florida with the 23rd overall pick in 2013, and he became a full-time starter in his second season. Floyd missed three games in 2015 for cartilage cleanup in his left knee, which continued to bother him the following training camp after the Vikings exercised the fifth-year option on his contract. After playing in the 2016 season opener, Floyd needed a similar arthroscopic operation on the right knee.\n\nDuring that surgery, Sohn said, doctors determined a more comprehensive procedure was necessary to help stimulate regrowth of Floyd\u2019s cartilage. After drilling into the knee bone, a post-operation pain blocker was injected into the nerve.\n\nFloyd\u2019s leg never fully recovered enough to be able to return to the field. He was placed on the non-football injury list before the 2017 season, after which his rookie contract expired.\n\n\u201cSharrif is never going to play football again because of permanent nerve and muscle damage in and around his right knee and right lower leg. That was directly caused, we allege, from the nerve block,\u201d Sohn said. \u201cThe only reason it was even arguably necessary is because a far more significant surgery was performed than what had been represented to Sharrif. They told him he\u2019d go in for a routine scope and be out a few weeks, and then they did a really complex procedure and required a significant pain intervention that ended his career.\u201d\n\nAndrews, two surgical fellows, an anesthesiologist, the hospital and the organizations associated with the doctors are named as defendants in the case.\n\n\u201cWe strongly dispute Mr. Floyd\u2019s allegations and plan to vigorously defend this case. Unfortunately we are unable to comment further due to the pending nature of the litigation,\u201d said Candy McGuyre, corporate marketing director with Baptist Health Care in Pensacola, Florida.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "New Mexico State uses deep rotation to beat NDSU 73-56\n\nLAS CRUCES, N.M.

Asian shares were mostly higher Wednesday as investors awaited results from the U.S. midterm elections, which could have an impact on the global economy and trade. (AP Photo/Eugene Hoshiko)\n\nTOKYO (AP) \u2014 Global shares were mixed Wednesday, reflecting uncertainty over the implications of U.S. midterm elections, as the Democrats look set to regain a majority in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nWhile the outcome of the vote was largely expected, it does potentially complicating President Donald Trump\u2019s legal troubles and policymaking agenda. It was unclear how the divided Congress might impact Trump\u2019s pursuit of an \u201cAmerica first\u201d trade strategy that has drawn the world\u2019s two biggest economies into a trade war.\n\n\u201cEuropean and U.S. futures are struggling to make up their mind as investors digest the implication of the midterm election,\u201d said Naeem Aslam of Thinkmarkets.com.\n\n\u201cOne thing is for certain, the midterm election was mainly about Trump. President\u2019s policies have divided the country and this was the first major political test of his presidency,\u201d he said in a commentary.\n\nEurope seemed encouraged by the results: France\u2019s CAC 40 rose 1.3 percent to 5,141.65, while Germany\u2019s DAX added 1.2 percent to 11,620.55. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 gained nearly 1.0 percent to 7,110.71. Futures advanced, with the contract for the Dow up 0.6 percent at 25,783.00 and S&P 500 futures surging 0.7 percent to 2,779.50.\n\nMost Asian benchmarks spent a large share of the day in positive territory but retreated in late trading. Japan\u2019s benchmark Nikkei 225 gave up 0.3 percent to finish at 22,085.80 and South Korea\u2019s Kospi slipped 0.5 percent to 2,078.69. The Shanghai Composite fell 0.7 percent to 2,641.34.\n\nBut Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng edged 0.1 percent higher to 26,147.69 and Australia\u2019s S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.4 percent to 5,896.90. Shares also rose in Singapore and Taiwan.\n\nA primary concern is the potential for dents in pan-Pacific trade that might hobble growth for export-reliant economies. Trump has imposed penalty tariffs of up to 25 percent on $250 billion of Chinese imports, and Beijing has responded with tariffs on $110 billion of American goods.\n\n\u201cThe real question is whether the outcome of the midterms will in any way diminish Trump\u2019s influence on the Congress, and whether his executive reach on global trade and other multilateral engagements will be reined in,\u201d Mizuho Bank said in a commentary.\n\nThe election\u2019s implications for currencies were another concern. A weaker dollar can help U.S. exports but hurt exporting economies of Asia. As of late Wednesday in Asia, the dollar was holding relatively steady at 113.07 yen, down from 113.36 a day earlier. The euro climbed to $1.1487 from $1.1427.\n\nOil prices have slipped after the U.S. said it would allow a group of allies to continue buying oil from Iran as long as they continued to try to reduce their imports from that nation. The U.S. reinstated sanctions on Iran this month.\n\nBenchmark U.S. crude oil fell 25 cents to $61.96 in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It fell 1.4 percent to $62.21 a barrel in New York Tuesday. Brent crude dipped 17 cents to $71.96.\n\n____\n\nYuri Kageyama is on Twitter at https://twitter.com/yurikageyama\n\nOn Instagram at https://www.instagram.com/yurikageyama/?hl=en", "", "", "KINGSTON, N.Y.

Arizona voters were also deciding on races for secretary of state, school superintendent and two utility regulator posts. All statewide seats are currently held by Republicans, but Democrats hoped to win one or two for the first time in a decade.\n\nDucey, the Republican Governors Association and other backers spent more than $15 million for advertisements attacking Garcia as weak on border issues. They asserted he wanted to abolish the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency \u2014 a claim denied by Garcia, who called for more humane treatment of immigrants, especially children.\n\nThe ads trumpeted Ducey\u2019s economic and border security accomplishments in Arizona, which has a 30 percent Latino population and some of the toughest state laws in the nation that target migrants in the U.S. illegally.\n\nDucey said he inherited a state with a $1 billion deficit and balanced the state budget without raising taxes and that he simplified the state tax code and cut regulations to generate jobs.\n\nEducation was a key gubernatorial race issue after an unprecedented statewide teacher strike in the spring shut down public schools for nearly a week as instructors demanded more funding. The teachers returned to class after Ducey signed a plan that granted pay raises that will reach 20 percent by 2020, including a 1 percent boost granted during the past budget year. The plan did not meet teacher demands for more money for school improvements and raises for other school employees.\n\nDespite his re-election, voters soundly rejected Ducey\u2019s initiative approved by the Legislature in 2017 that would have greatly expanded the state\u2019s private school voucher program. Public school advocates had used a provision in Arizona\u2019s constitution and gathered enough signatures to temporarily block the law and place it on Tuesday\u2019s ballot.\n\nBruce and Diana Husband, both 64-year-old retirees from Flagstaff, said they voted for Ducey and the rest of the Republican ticket because they wanted to ensure the U.S. isn\u2019t deadlocked over issues such as taxes, health care and immigration.\n\nBruce Husband said it would be unfair to let the caravan of asylum-seeking Central Americans into the U.S. while others apply through proper channels.\n\n\u201cMy heart goes out to them, but we can\u2019t be the bleeding heart for the world,\u201d he said.\n\nPolls showed the cash-strapped Garcia lagging in the race as the election neared, even though he was a strong supporter of the teacher\u2019s strike and said he wanted to increase state education funding, calling Ducey\u2019s education efforts \u201chalf measures and broken promises.\u201d\n\nBy mid-October, Garcia had raised only $2 million for his campaign, mostly in small individual contributions averaging about $50.\n\nDucey, who was born and raised in Toledo, Ohio, moved to Arizona to attend Arizona State University. Before entering politics, he was a businessman who led the Cold Stone Creamery ice cream parlor chain. He was elected state treasurer in 2010 and won the governor\u2019s race in 2014.\n\nGarcia was raised in the Phoenix suburb of Mesa, served as a U.S. Army infantryman, graduated from Arizona State University and received masters and doctorate degrees from the University of Chicago.

He was considered the most vulnerable GOP senator this year, and the only one seeking re-election in a state that Hillary Clinton carried in 2016.\n\nRosen, a Chicago native and University of Minnesota psychology graduate, moved to Las Vegas in 1980 and briefly worked as a waitress at Caesars Palace. Nevada will now be one of half a dozen states represented by U.S. senators who are both women.\n\n__\n\nJOSH HAWLEY (Missouri Republican)\n\nDemocrat Claire McCaskill\u2019s good fortune finally ran out Tuesday when Republican Josh Hawley flipped a crucial Senate seat in Missouri.\n\nRepublicans in increasingly conservative Missouri felt they missed an opportunity in 2012 when Senate hopeful Todd Akin\u2019s candidacy imploded after he said victims of \u201clegitimate rape\u201d rarely get pregnant.\n\nThis year party leaders united behind the 38-year-old Hawley, who had been in office less than two years as attorney general. He relentlessly attacked McCaskill as too liberal for a state Trump won by 19 percentage points in 2016, criticizing her for failing to vote for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nPresident Donald Trump campaigned on Hawley\u2019s behalf several times including twice in the week before Election Day.\n\nHawley grew up in Lexington, Missouri, near Kansas City. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree from Stanford and a law degree from Yale. He served as a law clerk for U.S. Chief Justice John Roberts and taught as an associate professor at the University of Missouri School of Law\n\nHawley\u2019s work history includes a stint with the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty in Washington, D.C., where he was part of the legal team for Hobby Lobby in its successful lawsuit against a contraceptive mandate of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n____\n\nMIKE BRAUN (Indiana Republican)\n\nIndiana\u2019s next senator is a little-known Republican businessman previously elected to two sleepy terms in the state Legislature, where one of his most notable actions was a vote to increase taxes.\n\nBut what multimillionaire auto parts magnate Mike Braun may lack in name recognition, he more than made up for by lending more than $10 million of his own fortune to his campaign.\n\nThat enabled him to beat two sitting congressmen, Luke Messer and Todd Rokita, in a bitter GOP primary, and then topple Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly in Tuesday\u2019s general election.\n\nDonnelly was one of the most vulnerable Democrats up for re-election in a state Trump carried two years ago.\n\nWorth somewhere between $37 million and $95 million, Braun came to politics after building a business empire that includes a trucking company and a national auto parts distribution business, Meyer Distributing. It has more than 800 employees and 70 locations across the U.S.\n\nBraun is a graduate of Wabash College and Harvard Business School, where he earned an MBA in 1978. He married his wife, Maureen, in 1976. They have four children.\n\nBefore launching his political career as a Republican, Braun voted in Democratic primaries until shortly before he first ran for the statehouse in 2014. He previously served as a member of a local school board.\n\n___\n\nKEVIN CRAMER (North Dakota Republican)\n\nKevin Cramer\u2019s admirers call it reckless honesty \u2014 an unfiltered way of thinking and talking that can be refreshing while sometimes getting him in trouble.\n\nIt was on display late in his Senate campaign when he minimized Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s allegation of sexual assault by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh by characterizing them as \u201cteenagers who evidently were drunk.\u201d As with some other statements during his career, Cramer found himself explaining and defending the remark \u2014 but eventually riding out the damage.\n\nThe 57-year-old Cramer\u2019s free-speaking style comes with remarkable accessibility, too. He employs his wife, Kris, as his campaign manager but most often fields questions himself, routinely sharing his cell number with reporters and rarely turning down an interview.\n\nThe former chairman of the state Republican Party has done a little bit of everything in his long career: state tourism director, state economic development director, Public Service Commission member. On the powerful PSC, Cramer regulated everything from oil pipelines and utilities to auctioneers, and left no doubt about his strong pro-oil and pro-coal outlook.\n\nCramer ran three times for the U.S. House before finally breaking through in 2012.\n\n___\n\nMARSHA BLACKBURN (Tennessee Republican)\n\nTennessee is replacing Bob Corker, one of the Senate GOP\u2019s most outspoken critics of President Donald Trump \u2014 at least at times \u2014 with a close ally of the president in Marsha Blackburn.\n\nBlackburn is a firm backer of Trump\u2019s U.S.-Mexico border wall, has sung the praises of his tax cuts, and came out in support of Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation to the Supreme Court the day Trump nominated him.\n\nBlackburn, who was first elected to the House in 2002, has aligned with the tea party movement and regularly appeared on Fox News. She opened her campaign by dubbing herself a \u201chardcore, card-carrying Tennessee conservative.\u201d\n\nBefore that, she made a name for herself as a state senator who helped lead the revolt against a failed Tennessee income tax proposal in the early 2000s. She also served as executive director of the state\u2019s Film, Entertainment, and Music Commission.\n\nThe 66-year-old from the Brentwood suburb of Nashville attended college on 4-H scholarship and worked her way through school selling books as the first woman ever hired by her company.

I saw a lot of nice hats out there on the ice.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Reilly came to St. Louis as part of a four-player, two-pick July 1 trade with Buffalo. The Blues sent Patrik Berglund, Vladimir Sobotka, Tage Thompson, a 2019 first-round pick and 2021 second-round pick to the Sabres.\n\nO\u2019Reilly has five goals in the last four games. He extended his scoring streak to eight games with seven goals and eight assists.\n\n\u201cHe puts a lot of work into his game,\u201d St. Louis coach Mike Yeo said.\n\nSt. Louis goalie Chad Johnson, starting his second game of the season, recorded 38 saves. It was his first victory as a member of the Blues and his first since March 31, 2018, when he was playing for Buffalo.\n\n\u201cI feel like I did a good job controlling the pucks,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt was a big win. We\u2019re doing a good job of battling.\u201d\n\nThe win was the fourth in the last five games for the Blues, now 5-5-3 on the season.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about the winning,\u201d Yeo said. \u201cBottom line, we\u2019ve won four of the last five and it doesn\u2019t really feel like it. We\u2019ve got to keep working.\u201d\n\nCarolina goalie Curtis McElhinney fell to 1-6-1 against the Blues in his career. He had 15 saves on 18 shots.\n\nThe Hurricanes outshot the Blues 39-19.

O\u2019Reilly scored twice and Vladimir Tarasenko recorded two assists.\n\nO\u2019Reilly gave St. Louis a 1-0 lead at 11:57 of the first. From the right side of the crease, Tarasenko passed the puck cross ice to O\u2019Reilly, who one-timed it past McElhinney.\n\nFabbri scored at 16:01 to give St. Louis a 2-0 lead. David Perron fed Fabbri, who deked McElhinney and lifted the puck over the prone goalie. It was Fabbri\u2019s first goal since Dec. 28, 2016, when he had a hat trick against Philadelphia.\n\nFabbri sustained a torn ACL on his left knee in a Feb. 4, 2017 game against the Pittsburgh Penguins and missed the remainder of the 2016-17 regular season and playoffs.

Slavin\u2019s slap shot from just inside the blue line zoomed past a screened Johnson, who never saw the puck.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty frustrating, but we dug ourselves a pretty big hole in the first period,\u201d Slavin said. \u201cWe have to be able to play a complete 60 minutes, and when we do that then the goals will start coming.\u201d\n\nSt. Louis came right back with a power-play goal with 4.7 seconds left in the period. O\u2019Reilly scored his second of the game on a slap shot from the left circle off a feed from Tyler Bozak from behind the net.\n\nO\u2019Reilly got the hat trick with an empty-netter at 16:50 of the third period.\n\nThe Blues have scored a power-play goal in six consecutive games and have had at least one in 11 of their 13 games this season.

Hudson (eight points) and Nembhard (six points) provided the majority of the early scoring. Florida senior guard KeVaughn Allen, who was 0 for 4 and didn\u2019t score a point in 23 minutes, had one of his worst career nights.\n\nFlorida State: The Seminoles played four guards most of the night as they began the season without Cofer, who led the team in scoring at 12.8 points per game but is out indefinitely with a foot injury.

Gibson, one of four returning starters and a native of Minnesota who starred at Champlin Park High School in the Twin Cities area, added 10 points for Omaha.\n\nCoffey, who played on the wing in his first two seasons and missed 14 games as a sophomore because of a shoulder injury, brought the ball up the court for much of the game in light of the departure of four-year standout Nate Mason. The 6-foot-8 Coffey, who had four assists, went 5 for 7 from the field and made all eight of his free throws. He played some at the shooting guard and small forward spots, but his size, calm and savviness makes Coffey a strong leader of the offense, with Washington as the top sub.\n\n\u201cWhen he decides to be aggressive he\u2019s a totally different person, so we need that Amir all the time,\u201d McBrayer said.\n\nMcBrayer gritted through a trying junior season with a stress reaction in his shin bone, as the Gophers sputtered to a 15-17 finish. His return to good health will be a big boost for the backcourt.\n\n\u201cWhen he\u2019s healthy, he\u2019s a really, really good guard,\u201d Pitino said.\n\nThe Mavericks went more than 6\u00bd minutes into the game without a field goal, including a missed dunk by Matt Pile, until Jackson finally knocked down a jumper in the paint. That gave them a jolt, because they used a 19-6 run capped by a 3-pointer from Gibson to take a 22-20 lead.\n\nOturu, the prize of an all-Minnesota freshman class along with wings Gabe Kalscheur and Jarvis Omersa, had a pair of putbacks, two rebounds and a blocked shot in the final 90 seconds of the first half to help the Gophers pull away. Coffey, fouled behind the arc at the buzzer by Ayo Akinwole, made three free throws for a 50-31 lead at the break.\n\n\u201cSome athleticism caught up to us. Oturu got us on a couple things, some high-major plays that we can\u2019t control,\u201d Mavericks coach Derrin Hansen said.\n\nNOT THIS TIME\n\nThree years ago, the Mavericks gave the Gophers a scare on the day after Thanksgiving in 2015 when Gibson and Jackson were freshmen. Omaha pulled within one point with 24 seconds left, and Minnesota missed five of its final eight free throw attempts before pulling out a 93-90 victory.\n\nThis was Omaha\u2019s ninth game against a Big Ten opponent since moving to Division I in 2011. The Mavericks have won once, at Iowa on Dec. 3, 2016.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nOmaha: Coming off a 9-22 record in 2017-18 and predicted in the preseason Summit League poll to finish eighth out of nine, the Mavericks play their first of five road games against power-conference opponents on the 2018-19 schedule. In upcoming trips to Colorado, Iowa State, Arizona State and 14th-ranked Oregon, they have experience and balance to be competitive, but depth and length are limited. They were outrebounded 41-21, and the Gophers had a 35-18 edge in bench scoring.\n\nMinnesota: Washington, the jewel of last year\u2019s class who had a rocky first season, found Omersa with lob passes for a pair of second-half dunks that brought the small crowd of 8,883 to a roar.\n\n\u201cJust staying confident, bringing joy to the team, keeping the energy going, trying to keep my guys level-headed,\u201d Washington said.\n\nThe Gophers might have played at too slow of a pace last season, Pitino said, for Washington to thrive.\n\n\u201cIsaiah learned how to play basketball by watching the NBA,\u201d Pitino said. \u201cI think you can tell that.\u201d\n\nUP NEXT\n\nOmaha: Plays Buena Vista, a Division III school in Iowa, in the home opener on Friday afternoon.\n\nMinnesota: Hosts Utah on Monday night, the first-ever visit by the Utes to Williams Arena.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball coverage: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "Colorado voters reject ballot measure restricting where new oil and gas wells can be drilled", "ST.

Joe Crowley of New York in June.\n\nBoth rode a rising wave of pro-woman sentiment to Washington as the party embraced diversity and liberal politics as the recipe for success in the Trump era.\n\n\u201cWith her victory tonight, Ayanna Pressley has not only made history as the first black woman ever elected to represent Massachusetts in the U.S. House of Representatives, she\u2019s ensured that Democrats have the voice of a young, black progressive woman helping lead the fight for inclusive populist reforms,\u201d the political action committee Democracy for America said Tuesday night in a statement.\n\nIn the run-up to the midterms, Pressley held off on saying where she stands on Nancy Pelosi, the Democrats\u2019 embattled House leader.\n\nFrom the outset, Pressley made clear that she meant serious business, telling voters before she sent Capuano packing that she viewed the race as \u201ca fight for the soul of our party and the future of our democracy.\u201d\n\nThe district includes a wide swath of Boston and about half of Cambridge, as well as portions of neighboring Chelsea, Everett, Randolph, Somerville and Milton. It includes the neighborhood of Roxbury, the traditional center of Boston\u2019s black community.\n\nIdeologically, Capuano was much like Pressley: liberal, a self-described progressive. But the white, middle-aged incumbent didn\u2019t look like many voters in his district, even though Pressley herself had bristled at the notion that race was a defining issue in the contest.\n\nShe flashed that defiance during a debate, saying: \u201cI happen to be black and a woman and unapologetically proud to be both, but that is not the totality of my identity.\u201d\n\nBut Pressley also made clear the importance of diversity in the nation\u2019s halls of power.\n\n\u201cI do think that our democracy is strengthened by an engagement of new and different voices,\u201d she told college newspaper editors in Boston in October.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "Auburn guard Jared Harper (1) defends against South Alabama guard John Pettway (50) during the first half of an NCAA college basketball game, Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2018, in Auburn, Ala.

In the first half, when Dallas built a 24-point lead, it looked like a foregone conclusion.\n\nThe Wizards climbed back within six midway through the fourth quarter, but Smith scooted past Dwight Howard to grab an offensive rebound and fed a cutting DeAndre Jordan for a dunk that put the Mavs up 101-93 with 5:33 left.\n\nJust 30 seconds later, the pair collaborated again on a pretty alley-oop, then Smith stole the ball from Bradley Beal near half-court and got it to Harrison Barnes for a three-point play and a 13-point lead.\n\n\u201cThis is where you\u2019ve got to trust your players,\u201d Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said. \u201cDennis has earned the trust.

The Eagles\u2019 offensive output was the lowest since the Carrier Dome opened in 1980.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy to be part of that record. Our defense is really what won us the game,\u201d Brissett said. \u201cOur leader in steals (starting point guard Frank Howard) wasn\u2019t even playing. Once we get him back out there, it\u2019s going to be even worse for other teams.\u201d\n\nEight players scored for Syracuse. Bourama Sidibe and Tyus Battle each had eight points, while Marek Dolezaj, Jalen Carey and Elijah Hughes had seven apiece.\n\nTyler Kidd led the Eagles with nine points. Jack Perry, the Eagles\u2019 leading 3-point shooter a year ago, had three points and shot 1 of 4 from 3.\n\nSyracuse had 10 steals and scored 33 points off 19 Eastern Washington turnovers.

Syracuse, which ranked last in 3-point shooting in the ACC last season, hit 3 of 17 while the Orange defense held the Eagles to 6 of 35.\n\nThe game was tied at 5 when Syracuse went on a 23-5 run to end the first half with a 28-10 lead. Never threatened, the Orange continued to dominate with an 18-3 blitz to start the second.\n\nThe Eagles shot 4-of-23 in the first half and missed 11 field goal attempts in a row, going almost 10 minutes between makes. The Orange weren\u2019t much better, hitting 37 percent.

The Democrat will also be the state\u2019s first black attorney general.\n\nJames defeated Republican lawyer Keith Wofford, a little-known candidate in a state where Democrats outnumber Republicans by more than 2 to 1.\n\nA longtime New York City politician, James is still introducing herself to people elsewhere in the state. Here is her biography at a glance:\n\nON HER VICTORY: \u201cAt a time when we are seeing such vitriol and such hate on the national level, led by someone who is supposed to be a voice for all Americans, I am proud to stand here as a New Yorker who knows that it\u2019s our diversity, our strength, our courage and our determination that makes us great.\u201d\n\nEXPERIENCE: James, 60, is in her second-term as New York City\u2019s public advocate, an ombudsman-like position that\u2019s first in the line of succession to the mayor. She previously served for a decade on the city council and was a public defender and assistant attorney general.\n\nPATH TO VICTORY: James entered the race after Attorney General Eric Schneiderman resigned in May amid allegations that he physically abused women. She picked up endorsements from Gov. Andrew Cuomo and rapper Nicki Minaj on her way to winning a four-way Democratic primary in September. James takes over from Attorney General Barbara Underwood, who was appointed in May and wasn\u2019t a candidate in the election.\n\nPERSONAL HISTORY: James was one of eight children, hailing from Brooklyn, New York. Her parents were maintenance workers. She graduated from Lehman College of the City University of New York and Howard University School of Law. She is not married and has no children.\n\nA TRUMP CRITIC: James said she wants the office to be a firewall against Trump\u2019s agenda and would continue pending lawsuits challenging his policies on immigration, the environment and other topics, as well as one accusing the president\u2019s charitable foundation of breaking the law. In her victory speech, she called Trump a \u201ccon man,\u201d \u2033carnival barker\u201d and \u201cfear monger\u201d and said she would be \u201cshining a bright light into every dark corner of his real estate dealings and every dealing.\u201d\n\nON POLICY: James said she wants to use her office\u2019s regulatory powers to prevent mortgage foreclosures and home abandonment, take action against slumlords, hold over-prescribing doctors and drug marketers accountable for their role in the opioid crisis and continue a partnership between the attorney general\u2019s office and the comptroller\u2019s office to police political corruption.", "Former state legislative leader Tim Armstead wins crowded race to keep seat on West Virginia Supreme Court", "Democrats pick up at least 3 House seats in New Jersey\n\nFILE- In this Oct. 9, 2018 file photo, Democratic congressional candidate Mikie Sherrill speaks during a candidate forum at the UJC of MetroWest New Jersey in Whippany, N.J.

(AP) \u2014 New Jersey voters on Tuesday delivered three Republican-controlled House seats to Democrats, ousting a Republican incumbent and converting two open GOP-held seats to Democratic control.\n\nTheir victories mean Democrats have picked up at least three new seats in New Jersey, where another closely watched race has not yet been called. Democrats had controlled seven seats to Republicans\u2019 five.\n\nDemocrat Tom Malinowski, a former state department official under President Barack Obama, defeated five-term GOP incumbent Leonard Lance in the 7th District. Mikie Sherrill, a veteran and one-time prosecutor, won in the 12th District over Republican Assemblyman Jay Webber after Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen announced his retirement. Democratic state Sen.

Grossman is an attorney and former Atlantic City councilman and Atlantic County officeholder. He said he was running to help Trump in Congress.\n\nElsewhere, incumbents in New Jersey had a good night. Seven congressmen won re-election in New Jersey.\n\nThree-term Democratic incumbent Rep.

(AP Photo/Jeffrey McWhorter)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 After hours of television commentating, swinging needles on election meters and reams of statistics from obscure counties called up on computer screens, CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper had a revelation about Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections.\n\n\u201cActually,\u201d he said, \u201cthis is pretty much what we thought was going to happen.\u201d\n\nThe House of Representatives appeared on the brink of switching from Republican to Democratic control. Republicans looked like they would expand their advantage in the Senate. Some close races broke blue, others broke red.\n\nPolls had suggested those results for months. Networks quoted exit polls that showed two-thirds of voters had made up their minds more than a month ago.\n\nStill, for news organizations covering the election Tuesday night, getting to that point was a roller-coaster journey of dips and dives.\n\nSensing extraordinary interest in the midterms, ABC, CBS and NBC devoted their entire prime-time schedules to monitoring the vote count across the country; most recent midterms had them covering the results for only one hour. Cable news networks gave it wall-to-wall coverage.\n\nAs the evening began, there were similarities to the 2016 election and President Donald Trump\u2019s surprise win. The cable networks gave attention to late-afternoon exit polls that seemed to indicate this year\u2019s vote would be a repudiation of Trump.\n\nThere were glum reactions on the set at Fox News Channel. Commentator Steve Hilton said that Trump has had a lot of achievements as president, but it seemed the midterms were becoming a battle of style vs. substance, and style was winning. Laura Ingraham said Democrats are better than Republicans in telling the story of America.\n\nBut by around 7 p.m., MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow confided that she was feeling a post-traumatic stress disorder reaction to what happened two years ago.\n\n\u201cAt some point, the Democratic confidence is going to run up against some real numbers,\u201d she said.\n\nMany of President Trump\u2019s fans do not participate in polls, and especially won\u2019t talk to someone conducting an exit poll, said CBS\u2019 Major Garrett. Some of these voters get measured only once, on Election Day, when it really matters, and that has an impact on the predictions, he said.\n\nMaddow\u2019s fears were soon realized and, like in 2016, Florida was a bellwether. Democrat Sen. Bill Nelson and gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum had jumped to early leads, but results started coming in and they fell behind. On MSNBC, guest James Carville\u2019s face looked grey.\n\n\u201cThere was some hope the Democrats were going to have a wave election,\u201d Carville said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be a wave election. It could be a good election. But I see the chances of a wave dissipating every time I look up at the board.\u201d\n\nLater, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, wearing a bright red dress and wide smile for an appearance on Fox, cited Carville\u2019s words.\n\nIt quickly became a common wave, nearly a cliche, across the dial: no blue wave, no tsunami. Election meter needles slipped close to the toss-up range for the House race.\n\n\u201cThis is heartbreaking,\u201d said CNN\u2019s Van Jones, predicting that Democrats would wake up the next morning with the same sense of outrage they\u2019ve felt for the past two years.\n\nThe change came like a thunderclap, and from an unexpected source. Fox News declared at 9:30 p.m. ET \u2014 a full 90 minutes ahead of rival CNN \u2014 that Democrats would win control of the House.\n\nAnd as more results came in, there was another change in mood.\n\nCarville\u2019s grin was back. He said the meter MSNBC was using to indicate the odds of House control had been driving him crazy but \u201cI\u2019m starting to like it as it goes toward the blue.\n\n\u201cI wanted to throw something at it a little bit earlier,\u201d he said.\n\nOn CNN, Jones said that \u201cmy heart has been restored.\u201d It might not be a blue wave, but given the number of women and minorities being added to the House, it\u2019s a rainbow wave, he said.\n\nAt MSNBC, before likely House Speaker Nancy Pelosi even gave a victory speech, there was a report that Democrats would seek release of Trump\u2019s tax returns. Anchor Brian Williams questioned the timing.\n\n\u201cIs that the right look by the Democratic Party before this night is even over to start making noise about the president\u2019s tax returns?\u201d he asked.\n\nIn some respects, the roller-coaster ride was just beginning.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press Television Writer Lynn Elber in Los Angeles contributed to this report.", "", "", "New Mexico voters approve constitutional amendment, clear way for the creation of an independent ethics commission", "", "", "Florida A&M runs away from Jacksonville in opener, 65-50\n\nJACKSONVILLE, Fla.

She also worked across the aisle with Republicans on issues like the opioid crisis and agriculture.\n\n\u201cTonight the people of New Hampshire 2nd Congressional District sent a message loud and clear that they want a Granite State and a country where no one is left behind and where we stand for the values of decency, integrity and opportunity for every single person,\u201d Kuster told her supporters.\n\n\u201cWhen I went to Congress, I promised a new approach and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done\u2014 bringing people together, Republicans, Democrats, Independents to solve complex problems,\u201d she said.\n\nIn the 2nd District, Kuster benefited from greater name recognition and her profile as an incumbent. Negron trailed in the polls for much of the campaign and was far outspent by Kuster.\n\nKuster said she plans to fight Republican proposals to cut Social Security and Medicare and would continue to advocate for women including sexual assault victims.\n\nFor his part, Negron who opposed expanding Medicaid in the state, argued that Medicare should be run by states and that the opioid crisis should be fought locally. Negron, the grandson of a Mexican immigrant and a supporter of President Donald Trump, was a backer of building a wall to stem illegal immigration.\n\n\u201cIt is disappointing to be honest with you. We thought we had done what we need to do to be competitive,\u201d Negron told The Associated Press. \u201cNo regrets ... I\u2019m not going away.

Vasilevskiy also had an in-close save on McDavid shortly after Edmonton kept the puck in the offensive zone for all two minutes of a second-period power play.\n\nVasilevskiy has allowed two or fewer goals in eight of 11 games.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s undoubtedly the reason why we win a lot of hockey games,\u201d Stamkos said. \u201cHe was outstanding again tonight.\u201d\n\nStamkos opened the scoring 4:40 into the game before Point got his ninth goal on a rebound to make it 2-0 with 25.1 seconds left in the period.\n\nAfter Strome got his first goal in 24 games at 12:32 of the second, the Lightning went back up 3-1 just 47 seconds later on Gourde\u2019s redirection.\n\n\u201cGet that out of the way,\u201d Strome said. \u201cGet on a roll.\u201d\n\nKucherov put Tampa Bay ahead 4-1 off a pass through the slot by Stamkos with 1:01 to go in the second.\n\n\u201cWe look for each other, we get open for each other,\u201d Kucherov said. \u201cThat\u2019s the point of this game and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nDraisaitl scored a power-play goal 40 seconds into the third off a nifty backhand pass by Rattie.\n\nKucherov had a power-play goal midway through the third.\n\nEdmonton\u2019s Milan Lucic got minor penalties for interference and roughing, and a 10-minute misconduct following a hit on Mathieu Joseph at 9:31 of the third.\n\n\u201cHe felt that a player took a liberty with (defenseman) Kris Russell, and I agree with the liberty part of it,\u201d McLellan said. \u201cPart of the reason we have Luc here is to take care of teammates and he did that.\u201d\n\nNOTES: The Lightning have won seven in a row at home against Edmonton. ...

The Christian conservative group Louisiana Family Forum and the Koch brothers\u2019 organization Americans for Prosperity joined the American Civil Liberties Union and the Southern Poverty Law Center among groups supporting the measure.\n\n___\n\nVoters will decide Tuesday whether Louisiana should join almost every other state in the nation where jury verdicts must be unanimous.\n\nFor decades jurors in felony trials \u2014 with the exception of death penalty cases \u2014 have been able to convict defendants with a 10-2 or 11-1 verdict.\n\nOregon is the only other state that allows split verdicts, and in Louisiana, support for joining the other 48 has been broad, with a rare coalition of conservatives and progressives calling for passage.\n\nU.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Republican, and the only Democrat in the state congressional delegation, Rep. Cedric Richmond of New Orleans, supported it. So did groups as politically diverse as the Louisiana Family Forum and the Southern Poverty Law Center.\n\nBackers derided split-verdict felonies as a vestige of Jim Crow-era polices promoting white supremacy, making it easier to convict non-white defendants even if one or two non-whites are on a jury. And they noted the possibility of a non-unanimous jury convicting innocent defendants.\n\nA video distributed by the Unanimous Jury Coalition featured two exonerated convicts who had been imprisoned as a result of split verdicts.\n\nIt was a fear exploited in a 30-second online ad for the amendment by the conservative Koch-brothers-backed Americans For Prosperity. \u201cImagine your child is charged with a crime she didn\u2019t commit,\u201d the ad said. \u201cMultiple jurors agree she is innocent but the government sends her to prison anyway.

They lost another forward when Erik Haula went down with an apparent right leg injury five minutes into the third.\n\nHaula, who collided with Marleau along the boards, stayed down for a few minutes as he was attended to by trainers from both teams before being stretchered off.\n\nThe Knights\u2019 power play, which came in ranked 28th, got a chance with under nine minutes left in regulation when Jake Gardiner went off for slashing, but it was unable to score.\n\nFleury made nice stops on Marner and John Tavares before Andersen stopped Rielly Smith\u2019s effort from the goal line with his arm and body with 2:33 left.\n\nVegas kept its foot on the gas with Fleury on the bench for an extra attacker, but couldn\u2019t get much in the way of pressure before Kadri scored his fourth into an empty net with 34.1 seconds left.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very frustrating,\u201d Vegas defenseman Shea Theodore said. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to play more of our style and we\u2019re starting to play a better game, but we\u2019re not burying those chances.\u201d\n\nNOTES: Brown\u2019s only other goal this season was into an empty net. ...

Horton-Tucker went 0 for 5 on 3s, but Prohm said he\u2019s been shooting about 40 percennt beyond the arc.

Haliburton showed impressive length and slashing ability, and he also finished with four assists and four steals. The 6-foot-10 Conditt had five points and four blocks in 14 minutes and Griffin, who didn\u2019t play until the second half after battling knee issues all summer, had four rebounds.\n\nPIVOTAL MOMENT\n\nThe Hornets actually gave Iowa State a bit of trouble midway through the first half, pulling to within 24-17. But Jacobson rescued a frantic possession with an elbow 3 and then grabbed a loose ball in the paint for an easy basket. Wigginton followed with a 3 and the outcome was never in doubt from there \u2014 though, to be fair, it never really was to begin with.\n\nHE SAID IT\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just going to try and keep bringing the energy that I have and the leadership that I can bring.

Massachusetts was the first to legalize gay marriage and is viewed as one of the most LGBT-friendly states.\n\nCritics say the 2016 law allowed sexual predators to invade private spaces for women by claiming female gender identity. No such incidents have been reported in Massachusetts since the measure took effect.\n\nActivists on both sides of the debate watched the Massachusetts vote carefully. National LGBT rights groups, and the American Civil Liberties Union, offered financial support and other resources for the ballot campaign, helping supporters of the law outraise and outspend by a wide margin those who wanted to repeal it.\n\nThe National Center for Transgender Equality called Tuesday\u2019s vote \u201ca stunning rebuke of anti-transgender lies and prejudice.\u201d\n\nNineteen other U.S. states have similar laws or legal precedents protecting transgender people, but the vote in Massachusetts was the first statewide referendum on the issue.\n\n\u201cWe are deeply disappointed that the people of Massachusetts will continue to be forced to sacrifice their privacy and safety in the name of political correctness,\u201d said Andrew Beckwith, legal analyst for No On 3- Keep MA Safe.\n\nThe stakes appeared to rise even higher last month following a report that the Trump administration was considering adoption of a new definition of gender that would effectively deny federal recognition and civil rights protections to transgender Americans. The New York Times reported that the Department of Health and Human Services was circulating a memo proposing that gender be defined as an immutable biological condition determined by a person\u2019s sex organs at birth.\n\nLGBT leaders in Massachusetts said the prospect of federal action made it even more critical that voters uphold existing state laws.\n\nLaverne Cox, a transgender actress who was nominated for an Emmy Award for her role in the Netflix series \u201cOrange is the New Black,\u201d was among those who appeared at an Oct. 24 news conference in Boston to lend her name and voice to the campaign for a \u201cyes\u201d vote that would keep the law.\n\nOpponents of the 2-year-old law argued their intent was not to strip protections for transgender people or legalize discrimination. Instead, they said, the goal was to protect women from being harassed or assaulted by criminals falsely claiming to identify as female.\n\nOne ad run by the group Keep Massachusetts Safe depicted a sketchy-looking man entering a women\u2019s locker room as a young woman begins to undress. LGBT groups blasted the ad and others like it as scare tactics, but opponents of the law defended the approach.\n\n\u201cThat is what the law allows for, and if it\u2019s scary, then that is because we are talking about something that is scary,\u201d said Yvette Ollada, a spokeswoman for the repeal advocates.\n\nThe law allows for the prosecution of any person \u201cwhose assertion of a gender identity is for an improper purpose.\u201d A review of complaints filed with the state attorney general\u2019s office and the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination turned up only a handful directly related to the 2-year-old law, and none specifically alleging predatory behavior in a women\u2019s bathroom or locker room.\n\nNicole Talbot, a 17-year-old transgender girl, was among several teens who spoke out in favor of the law in interviews and in ads aired by supporters designed to humanize transgender people.\n\n\u201cTransgender people ... we\u2019re just trying to live our lives as who we are like everyone else and that includes going to the bathroom; that includes going to work, that includes buying coffee at a coffee shop, going out to dinner or seeing a movie,\u201d she said.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "Tania Beaudet, left, and and M.J.

Maria Cantwell to Washington, D.C., for a fourth term.\n\nThe hotly contested open seat in the 8th Congressional District was one of the nation\u2019s costliest congressional races, as Democrat Kim Schrier led Republican Dino Rossi in early returns. In Eastern Washington, Republican incumbent Cathy McMorris Rodgers beat Democrat Lisa Brown in the 5th District, and in southwest Washington, Republican Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler was leading Democrat Carolyn Long.\n\nHere\u2019s a snapshot of who voted and why in Washington, based on preliminary results from AP VoteCast, an innovative nationwide survey of about 139,000 voters and nonvoters \u2014 including 4,418 voters and 462 nonvoters in the state of Washington \u2014 conducted for The Associated Press by NORC at the University of Chicago.\n\n___\n\nTOP ISSUE: HEALTH CARE\n\nHealth care was at the forefront of voters\u2019 minds: More than one-quarter named it as the most important issue facing the nation in this year\u2019s midterm elections. About one-fifth said immigration was paramount, while the economy, the environment and gun policy were the top issues for others.\n\nNancy Andrews, a retired 73-year-old from Seattle who has suffered from a pulmonary embolism, said she spends about four months a year in France and has experienced emergency room care there. A four-day hospital stay there cost vastly less than a one-day stay in the U.S., she said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous to me we can\u2019t get that under control,\u201d she said.\n\nAndrews dropped off her ballot at a drop box in North Seattle on Tuesday morning.

The national rate is 3.7 percent, a five-decade low.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP FACTOR\n\nFor about one-third of Washington voters, President Donald Trump was not a factor they considered while casting their vote. By comparison, two-thirds said he was.\n\nIn heavily Democratic Seattle, a dearth of high-profile races prompted some voters to direct their attention \u2014 and money \u2014 elsewhere, and they cited their opposition to Trump as their motivation. Andrews said she made campaign contributions for the first time in her life this year, giving to Democratic House candidates in other Washington districts.\n\nNina Lamble, a 33-year-old Seattle physician and mother, said she\u2019s given more campaign contributions this year than ever before \u2014 so much she\u2019s lost track. She joined a Facebook group called Physician Women for Democratic Principles, whose members she said had contributed $1.5 million to progressive candidates around the country.\n\nLamble said she\u2019s so frustrated with the Trump administration it was hard to even name a top concern. Protecting vulnerable people, including immigrants, and the environment were among her priorities.\n\n\u201cI feel like our country is falling apart,\u201d Lamble said as she dropped off her ballot at a North Seattle drop box Tuesday. \u201cI have small children, and I feel like we\u2019re not leaving this place better than how we found it.\u201d\n\n___\n\nCONTROL OF CONGRESS\n\nTuesday\u2019s elections will determine control of Congress in the final two years of Trump\u2019s first term in office, and two-thirds of Washington voters said which party will hold control was very important as they considered their vote. Another 1 in 5 said it was somewhat important.\n\n___\n\nAP VoteCast is a survey of the American electorate in all 50 states conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago for The Associated Press and Fox News.

Pollock and Michael Brantley, infielders Manny Machado and Josh Donaldson, starting pitchers Dallas Keuchel, Patrick Corbin, Hyun-Jin Ryu and Nathan Eovaldi, and closers Craig Kimbrel and Zach Britton.\n\n\u201cThe good ones will get their money,\u201d Philadelphia GM Matt Klentak said. \u201cThey\u2019ll sign. They\u2019ll end up in good places. And whether that\u2019s here in November or whether it\u2019s in December, January, February or even March, I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nWashington GM Mike Rizzo said the Nationals attempted to reach a deal with Harper before he became a free agent.\n\n\u201cWe utilized our exclusivity to negotiate with him late in the season through when he became eligible to sign with a team,\u201d Rizzo said. \u201cThere is a reality that we would love to sign him but we may not.\u201d\n\nSome teams have delayed their offseason planning because of front-office changes. Los Angeles Dodgers GM Farhan Zaidi was hired just Tuesday as San Francisco\u2019s president of baseball operations and Baltimore has not replaced Dan Duquette as its top baseball decision-maker.\n\nBrodie Van Wagenen, who had been an agent at CAA Baseball, replaced Sandy Alderson as the New York Mets\u2019 general manager. About two weeks before the start of spring training last winter, Van Wagenen suggested players considering boycotting spring training because of the slow market.\n\n\u201cHard to say about whether there will be any carry-over effect to this year,\u201d he said. \u201cI think there was an element last year where the trade market was slowed, as well, which also pushed the free-agent market back.\u201d\n\nTeams now project their rosters well into the future, and players who could be free agents after the 2019 World Series could be dealt this offseason for a bigger return than they would get ahead of next summer\u2019s trade deadline, especially if they don\u2019t agree to long-term deals. Among the possibilities are Arizona first baseman Paul Goldschmidt, Colorado third baseman Nolan Arenado, San Francisco left-hander Madison Bumgarner and Mets right-hander Zack Wheeler.\n\nArizona general manager Mike Hazen said a multiyear deal with Goldschmidt would take creativity, and a trade had to be considered.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the consummate teammate, Diamondback. What he\u2019s done for the organization both on and off the field is everything you want in a player,\u201d Hazen said. \u201cI met with Paul. I think there\u2019s an understanding of where the organization is at present. But I think it would pretty tough.\u201d\n\nCC Sabathia became the first free agent to reach a deal since the market opened Saturday, agreeing to an $8 million, one-year contract with the New York Yankees. The 38-year-old left-hander accepted a $2 million cut to return to the Bronx for an 11th season in a deal subject to a successful physical.\n\nNew York is being more aggressive this offseason after falling below the luxury tax threshold for the first time in 2018.\n\n\u201cLast year we had to be really careful about every step we took in terms of financial commitments, so it took longer because we were having to have that luxury-tax issue in the back of our minds,\u201d general manager Brian Cashman said.\n\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers dropped below the threshold for the first time since 2012 and won their second straight NL pennant \u2014 but lost the World Series for the second consecutive year. The only teams projected over this year were the World Series champion Boston Red Sox, who had the highest payroll for the first time in the free-agent era, and Washington.\n\nAlan Nero, who negotiated first baseman Carlos Santana\u2019s $60 million, three-year deal with the Phillies last fall, said agents have to be realistic with their clients.\n\n\u201cI think you have to understand we\u2019re in a changing market and you\u2019re not going to get a 10-year deal,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of managing expectations.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP Baseball Writer Janie McCauey and AP freelance writer Jay Paris contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "", "", "", "Rep.

Andy Barr won a fourth term in Kentucky\u2019s 6th Congressional District, defeating Democrat and former Marine fighter pilot Amy McGrath on Tuesday in a district that President Donald Trump won by double digits in 2016.\n\nMcGrath was considered Barr\u2019s toughest challenger since he arrived in Congress in 2012. In his victory speech in Lexington, Barr agreed.\n\n\u201cAmy McGrath was tough competition. As I have always said, competition is a good thing. I embrace competition \u2014 especially tough competition, which brings out the best in people by encouraging effort and producing excellence,\u201d Barr said. \u201cSo I am grateful to Lt. Col. McGrath and everyone who supported her for this tough and hard-fought campaign, as it will make me a better leader and a better congressman.\u201d\n\nIncumbents also won in Kentucky\u2019s five other congressional districts, all Republican except for the Louisville-area 3rd District, where Democrat John Yarmuth was first elected in 2006.\n\nBoth parties saw the race in the 6th District, which includes Lexington and state capital Frankfort, as close. Barr hosted a rally with President Donald Trump, and McGrath campaigned at a high school gym with former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nIn a statement Tuesday evening, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said, \u201cI\u2019d like to join with all of his supporters in congratulating my good friend Congressman Andy Barr on his re-election. Andy is a strong voice for Kentucky in Washington, and I am glad he\u2019ll be back in the U.S. House of Representatives.\u201d\n\nBarr throughout the campaign labeled McGrath as \u201ctoo liberal\u201d for Kentucky.\n\nIn her concession speech in Richmond, McGrath said, \u201cWe must demand a more civil tone and tenor in our politics. We deserve better than a win at all costs mentality. I was unwilling and remain unwilling to be part of the problem.\u201d\n\nOlivia Renfro, a Centre College student, hugged McGrath and cried after her concession.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m feeling pretty devastated, I really believed in her campaign. I really thought she would pull out a win,\u201d said Renfro, who canvassed for McGrath during the campaign. But Renfro said she was inspired as a woman to run for office someday.\n\nBarr leaned heavily on the district\u2019s rural counties, winning Madison County, Lexington\u2019s neighbor, with 59 percent of the vote. President Donald Trump came to campaign for Barr in Madison County\u2019s largest city, Richmond, in mid-October.\n\nMcGrath had hoped to flip a congressional district that has switched party control five times since 1978. But some voters said they liked the way things were going and stuck with Barr.\n\n\u201cWe are doing good now, so why change things up? I\u2019ve heard good things about Amy, but I guess a little scared for change, so maybe kind of keep it neutral,\u201d said Elizabeth Blythe, a 25-year-old from Georgetown in Scott County. \u201cI think it\u2019s good to keep things the same right now.\u201d\n\nMike Bickers liked where Barr stood on taxes and immigration issues. He said he was also turned off by the Brett Kavanaugh hearings during his Supreme Court nomination process.\n\n\u201cI just didn\u2019t like the way the Democrats treated that man,\u201d said Bickers, a 65-year-old retiree.\n\nMcGrath raised nearly twice as much money as Barr, using it to build a get-out-the-vote operation with field offices in all the district\u2019s 19 counties. Barr focused heavily on negative TV ads and large rallies featuring Trump and his allies.

Franklin, File)\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 Former Dodgers general manager Farhan Zaidi is the new president of baseball operations for the San Francisco Giants.\n\nThe Giants announced the hiring Tuesday night and planned a formal introduction at AT&T Park on Wednesday, a day before they hold a public celebration of life for late Hall of Famer Willie McCovey.\n\nBaseball executives are meeting this week for the GM meetings in Carlsbad, California, and Giants CEO Larry Baer knew it might take this long to find the right person to push the department in a fresh direction.\n\nZaidi just completed his fourth year as GM for Los Angeles. His Dodgers won a sixth straight NL West title and lost in the World Series each of the past two seasons.\n\n\u201cWe set out to find one of the best minds in baseball and Farhan\u2019s many accomplishments and expertise exceeded our expectations,\u201d Baer said. \u201cFarhan is widely viewed as one of the top executives in our industry and we are thrilled to have him lead the next chapter of Giants baseball.\u201d\n\nIn November 2014, the Canadian-born Zaidi departed his job as assistant GM of the Oakland Athletics to lead the Dodgers under Andrew Friedman. Zaidi earned his bachelor\u2019s degree in economics from Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1998 and a PhD in economics from the University of California at Berkeley in 2011.\n\nSo, Zaidi brings more of an analytical emphasis and strength. The Giants sought to upgrade their baseball operations department and take a \u201cfresh approach,\u201d as Baer put it.\n\n\u201cI am delighted to return to the Bay Area and to join one of the most storied franchises in the game,\u201d said Zaidi, who turns 42 this coming Sunday. \u201cI have watched the Giants from afar and I have great respect for the organization\u2019s culture and many accomplishments. I am excited about this new opportunity and I\u2019m looking forward to getting right to work.\u201d\n\nZaidi is expected to have the flexibility to hire someone as GM under him. He spent 10 seasons with Oakland and received plenty of responsibility on Billy Beane\u2019s staff, such as playing a key role in the acquisition of Cuban slugger Yoenis Cespedes before the 2012 season.\n\nThe Giants dismissed GM Bobby Evans in September.

He also worked on arbitration cases, minor league contracts and worked closely with coaches to analyze data from advance scouting reports.\n\nZaidi previously served as business development associate for Small World Media, the fantasy sports division of The Sporting News, and also worked as a management consultant for the Boston Consulting Group.\n\nThe San Francisco Chronicle first reported the hiring Tuesday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "", "NEWARK, N.J.

(AP) \u2014 A year to the day after a federal jury began deliberating corruption charges against him, New Jersey Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez on Tuesday fended off his wealthy Republican challenger to win re-election.\n\nMenendez, 64, defeated Republican Bob Hugin after a grueling and often ugly campaign to win a third term.\n\nIn front of cheering supporters, Menendez called it \u201ca victory of hope over hate, facts over fiction, inclusion over division, for hard work over ripping people off.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so proud that New Jerseyans rejected the politics of personal destruction and the false, negative salacious ads,\u201d he added, referring to the Hugin campaign\u2019s television ads linking him to unsubstantiated years-old allegations of liaisons with underage prostitutes that surfaced before his corruption charges.\n\nPolls showed Hugin, 64, a former executive with drug maker Celgene, and Menendez much closer than expected in overwhelmingly Democratic New Jersey.\n\nIn seeking to become the first Republican elected to the Senate from New Jersey since 1972, Hugin tapped his deep pockets for more than $30 million and spent on TV ads attacking Menendez over the 2017 trial on charges that he helped a friend with Medicare billing in exchange for lavish gifts.\n\nDemocratic U.S. Senator Bob Menendez voted Tuesday morning in Harrison, New Jersey. (Nov. 6)\n\nThe charges were dropped this year after a mistrial last fall. Menendez had always denied wrongdoing, but the Senate Ethics Committee admonished him and concluded that he violated the law.\n\nHe apologized to the public in a TV interview and in the race\u2019s only debate in the weeks before the election.\n\nIn his concession speech Tuesday, Hugin told supporters that he was proud that his campaign created \u201ca new template\u201d for Republicans by reaching out to urban areas in all corners of the state and letting people know \u201cwe represent all of New Jersey.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t the right messenger to get it delivered, but we opened the door,\u201d he said.\n\nOne of Menendez\u2019s supporters at his victory party was Evelyn Arroyo-Maultsby, a member of the jury at his 2017 corruption trial who was excused midway through deliberations for a scheduled vacation. Arroyo-Maultsby told The Record on Tuesday night that Menendez was \u201ca great man\u201d and repeated her contention from after the trial that he had done nothing wrong.\n\nAnother supporter Samantha Bohr, 26, of Parsippany-Troy Hills, said she backed Menendez despite the trial.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day it was a hard choice, and when the good outweighs the bad, you just have to go with it,\u201d Bohr said.\n\nBohr said she backed Menendez on the expectation that he will be a voice in the Senate to protect health care for Americans and work for immigration reform.\n\nThe race was particularly significant because Democrats sought to defend 26 seats, including 10 incumbents running in states that President Donald Trump won in 2016.\n\nNearly all New Jersey\u2019s voters casting midterm election ballots said deciding who controls Congress played a role in their decision, according to a wide-ranging survey of the American electorate.\n\nAP VoteCast found most said that Trump was a factor in their vote, while a majority also said the country is headed in the wrong direction.\n\nAP VoteCast, an innovative nationwide survey of about 138,000 voters and nonvoters \u2014 including 3,800 voters and 664 nonvoters in the state of New Jersey \u2014 conducted for The Associated Press by NORC at the University of Chicago.\n\nMenendez\u2019s 2015 corruption indictment in which federal prosecutors charged that he accepted lavish gifts from a Florida eye doctor who is his friend in exchange for helping him with a Medicare billing issue was a central issue in the campaign.\n\nHugin, though, concentrated on scandalous details in the trial, calling Menendez untrustworthy and highlighting a Senate Ethics Committee admonition letter that took him to task. The ethics panel concluded Menendez\u2019s actions \u201creflected discredit upon the Senate.\u201d\n\nMenendez defended himself by pointing to votes for women\u2019s rights and on health care. He also attacked Hugin over his time at Celgene, which settled for $280 million on Hugin\u2019s watch in 2017 over allegations it promoted cancer drugs that were not approved by the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nThe company didn\u2019t admit liability, and Hugin points to the life-saving drugs that the company makes for cancer patients.\n\nThe race was ugly at times.\n\nHugin ran an ad that referred to the allegations involving prostitutes, which Menendez called \u201clies.\u201d\n\nBut the barrage of negative ads led to outside Democratic groups pouring money into the race. Senate Majority PAC, for example, said in the final weeks of the campaign that it was spending $3 million on TV ads.\n\nPresident Donald Trump seemed to be a factor in the campaign. Menendez raised him as a boogeyman and said Hugin would effectively be a rubber stamp for him in Washington.\n\nHugin, who contributed to Trump\u2019s campaign and appeared at the White House for a roundtable talk about drug prices alongside Trump, largely tried to keep his distance.

Under state law in Florida, a recount is mandatory if the winning candidate\u2019s margin is less than 0.5 percentage points.\n\nScott had declared victory over the three-term senator late Tuesday before all precinct results were in, but Nelson did not concede, and his campaign said he would make no statement until later Wednesday. The Associated Press had not called the race.\n\nScott had been trailing in most polls leading up to Election Day.

Nelson has criticized Scott as an untrustworthy Trump supporter who used the governor\u2019s office to increase his wealth. His supporters also hit Scott for the state\u2019s environmental problems, calling him \u201cRed Tide Rick\u201d for the deadly algae that has killed millions of fish off Florida\u2019s coasts.\n\nATTORNEY GENERAL\n\nRepublican Ashley Moody defeated Democratic state Rep. Sean Shaw, keeping the state\u2019s top law enforcement position in Republican hands.\n\nMoody is a former judge and federal prosecutor from the Tampa area who has criticized Shaw\u2019s lack of courtroom experience. Shaw would have been Florida\u2019s first black attorney general. He is the son of the late state Supreme Court Justice Leander Shaw. He campaigned as a consumer advocate and called for new gun restrictions.\n\nMoody will replace Pam Bondi, who could not seek re-election because of term limits. Democrats last won the attorney general\u2019s race in 1998.\n\nCHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER\n\nRepublican Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis defeated former Democratic Sen. Jeremy Ring, keeping the office he was appointed to fill when Jeff Atwater resigned last year.\n\nPatronis served eight years in the state House and was a member of the board that regulates the state\u2019s utilities when Scott appointed him the state\u2019s top finance official in June 2017.\n\nRing is a former Yahoo executive from Broward County. He served in the state Senate from 2006 to 2016.\n\nAGRICULTURE COMMISSIONER\n\nRepublican state Rep. Matt Caldwell narrowly led Democratic lobbyist and lawyer Nikki Fried with nearly all votes counted in the race to replace departing Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam. The race could be headed to a recount as Caldwell\u2019s lead was just below the 0.5 percent margin needed to avoid one.\n\nCaldwell is a real estate appraiser and seventh generation Floridian who served as chairman of the House Government Accountability Committee. He served eight years in the House.\n\nFried based a large part of her campaign advocating for the medical marijuana industry and criticizing the state\u2019s implementation of a constitutional amendment approved by voters allowing its use. Fried would be the first woman elected as Florida agriculture commissioner.\n\nPutnam could not seek re-election because of term limits.\n\nCONGRESS\n\nDemocrats captured two Republican seats in Miami, flipping the District 27 seat held by the retiring Republican Ileana Ros-Lehtinen. Democrat Donna Shalala, who served as President Bill Clinton\u2019s Health and Human Services secretary and as University of Miami president, defeated Republican Maria Elvira Salazar, a television journalist who worked for Spanish language networks.\n\nMeanwhile in District 26, Democrat Debbie Mucarsel-Powell defeated Republican U.S. Rep. Carlos Curbelo. Mucarsel-Powell has worked for several nonprofit organizations in Miami-Dade County.\n\nElsewhere:\n\n\u2014 Republican businessman and former Army Lt. Col. Michael Waltz in District 6 defeated Democrat Nancy Soderberg, a former United Nations ambassador and member of Bill Clinton\u2019s National Security Council. He will replace DeSantis, who resigned after winning the Republican gubernatorial primary.\n\n\u2014 Republican state Rep. Ross Spano defeated Democrat Kristen Carlson for the District 15 seat held by retiring Rep. Dennis Ross. Carlson is a former prosecutor who also served as the general counsel for the Florida Department of Citrus.\n\n\u2014 Republican state Sen. Greg Steube defeated Democrat Allen Ellison for retiring Tom Rooney\u2019s District 17 seat. Ellison replaced April Freeman on the ballot when she died after winning the primary.\n\n\u2014 Democratic first-term U.S. Rep. Stephanie Murphy defeated Republican state Rep. Mike Miller in District 7.\n\n\u2014 Freshman Republican U.S. Rep.

Mario Diaz-Balart defeated Democratic former judge Mary Barzee Flores.\n\nBALLOT QUESTIONS\n\nFlorida voters passed bans on greyhound racing, offshore oil drilling and using electronic cigarettes in most businesses, and made it more difficult for casino gambling to expand and taxes to be increased. The 12 constitutional amendments required 60 percent to pass and all but Amendment 1 passed. They number 1-7 and 9-13 after the state Supreme Court removed Amendment 8 from the ballot.\n\nAmendment 13 banned dog racing in Florida by 2021. That\u2019s a blow to the industry that\u2019s been dwindling over the past two decades. Only five other states have active dog racing.\n\nAmendment 4 could have a long-lasting impact on the state\u2019s politics as most felons who complete their sentences will now have their voting rights automatically restored. It does not apply to murderers and rapists. More than 1.4 million ex-felons couldn\u2019t vote in Florida, and critics of the felon voting ban say it disproportionally affects minority voters who tend to support Democrats.\n\nHere are the other ballot questions:\n\n\u2014 Amendment 1 was the only measure that failed. It would have increased the state\u2019s property tax homestead exemption from $50,000 to as much as $75,000 on homes worth more than $100,000. It was just below the 60 percent threshold.\n\n\u2014 Amendment 2 passed. It will permanently keep in place a 10 percent cap on property tax assessments for commercial and rental properties that is current law, but is set to expire next year.\n\n\u2014 Amendment 3 easily passed. It will require statewide voter approval to expand casino gambling in Florida, taking control out of the hands of the Legislature.\n\n\u2014 Amendment 5 passed. It will require a two-thirds majority vote before the Legislature could increase taxes or fees.\n\n\u2014 Amendment 6 passed, providing additional rights to crime victims and would raise the mandatory retirement age for judges from 70 to 75.\n\n\u2014 Amendment 7 passed. It will require a supermajority vote before state university boards of trustees can raise fees. It will also pay death benefits, including help with education expenses, to the survivors of first responders who die on the job.\n\n\u2014 Amendment 9 passed. It prohibits oil drilling in state waters and ban vaping in work places where smoking is already prohibited.\n\n\u2014 Amendment 10 passed. It will require the state to create an Office of Domestic Security and Counter-Terrorism and maintain a Department of Veterans Affairs, which already exists. It also sets the start of the annual legislative session to January instead of March in even-numbered years and requires counties to elect a sheriff, tax collector, property appraiser, elections supervisor and circuit court clerk.\n\n\u2014 Amendment 11 easily passed. It allows the Legislature to make some changes to criminal laws retroactive. It would also repeal language in the constitution that\u2019s now considered obsolete.\n\n\u2014 Amendment 12 passed. It bans elected officials, agency heads, judges and others from paid lobbying while serving and for six years after leaving office instead of the current two.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "", "", "", "FILE - In this 2018 combination of photos Pennsylvania U.S. Senate candidates Sen. Bob Casey D-Pa., left, and Rep. Lou Barletta, R-Pa., are shown in Philadelphia. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke, File)\n\nHARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) \u2014 Democrat Bob Casey has won a third U.S. Senate term from Pennsylvania on Tuesday, beating Republican congressman and Donald Trump supporter Lou Barletta in a state the president won two years ago.\n\nCasey\u2019s victory gives him another six-year term in office and ensures that President Trump will have another swing state opponent in the closely divided Senate.\n\n\u201cThis election really was a victory for people across our commonwealth who want a new direction in Washington,\u201d Casey said. \u201cIt was also a triumph for people who are really concerned about their health care and what will happen to them and their families.\u201d\n\nThe 58-year-old son of the late governor of the same name has now won six statewide elections, including wins in races for state treasurer and auditor general.\n\nThe race was a far cry from Pennsylvania\u2019s record-breaking $170 million race in 2016, coming at under $40 million while control for the Senate was waged in perhaps a dozen other states.\n\nThe candidates were on opposite sides of Trump.\n\nBarletta, 62, is one of Trump\u2019s biggest allies on Capitol Hill and drew two presidential visits to Pennsylvania to help rally support for his candidacy.\n\nBut Barletta never gained traction against Casey, and was heavily outspent while getting virtually no outside help from GOP groups to overcome Casey\u2019s heavy fundraising advantage and built-in recognition as a household name in Pennsylvania politics.\n\nSurrounded by family in Scranton, Casey recalled that his father\u2019s first statewide run for office was 50 years ago, \u201cso my mother\u2019s been through a lot of election nights.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re of course thinking about his life of service and his life of commitment to our commonwealth,\u201d Casey said.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Casey pounded Trump\u2019s tax-cutting law as a giveaway to the wealthy and corporations while middle-class wages stagnate. Casey opposed Trump\u2019s immigration policies and voted against Trump\u2019s nominees for Supreme Court while he stitched together support from liberals and his longtime allies in organized labor.\n\nCasey also sounded alarm bells over what he framed as threats to Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security under GOP-controlled Washington.\n\nBarletta said he called Casey to congratulate him and hoped Casey would \u201cwork with President Trump for the good of the American people. I\u2019m sure he will.\u201d He said Casey would \u201cserve the people of Pennsylvania as he always has.\u201d\n\nBarletta was first elected to Congress in 2010, catapulted by his efforts to combat illegal immigration while serving as mayor the small northeastern city of Hazleton.\n\nTrump asked Barletta to run, and Barletta campaigned on Trump\u2019s policies and record, particularly immigration, where their views dovetailed.\n\nBut Barletta failed to reconstruct the coalition of Republicans and conservative Democrats that had helped Trump become the first Republican presidential candidate to win Pennsylvania since 1988.\n\nThe final weeks of the campaign were trying for Barletta. His 18-month-old grandson, a twin, was diagnosed with cancer and his brother died. In the midst of this, Casey launched a series of statewide TV ads accusing Barletta of voting in Congress to let insurers strip coverage for pre-existing conditions.\n\nBarletta cried foul, saying an ad featuring a woman whose twin daughters were diagnosed with cancer was particularly cruel to his family because it mirrored his grandson\u2019s plight.\n\nCasey apologized if the ad had caused Barletta and his family any pain. Any similarity had been unintended, Casey said, and the campaign took down the ad in the Scranton TV market. But Casey declined Barletta\u2019s request to take down the ad in the rest of the state and his campaign said flatly that Barletta \u201cwill be held accountable\u201d for his votes.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "No. 1 Kansas holds off No. 10 Michigan State 92-87 in opener\n\n1 of 3 Kansas forward Dedric Lawson (1) fights for a rebound with Michigan State forward Xavier Tillman (23) during the first half of an NCAA college basketball game at the Champions Classic in Indianapolis on Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2018.

(Shelley Mays/The Tennessean via AP)\n\nNASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 Republican businessman and political newcomer Bill Lee will become Tennessee\u2019s next governor, after he bested Democratic former Nashville Mayor Karl Dean on Tuesday\n\nLee will replace outgoing GOP Gov. Bill Haslam.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m grateful for the voters of Tennessee, grateful that you placed your trust in us to lead this great state,\u201d Lee said during his acceptance speech in Franklin, before hundreds of supporters. \u201cWe ran a positive campaign from the very beginning until the very last day because we wanted to give a picture of what this state could look like.\u201d\n\nFrom the beginning of his political campaign, Lee cast himself as a political outsider who underwent a personal transformation when he faced the death of his first wife of 16 years, Carol Ann, from a tragic horseback riding accident. His religious faith became a defining characteristic along the campaign trail and described running for the governor\u2019s office as a \u201ccalling.\u201d\n\nHe surprised many when he secured the Republican nomination in August after going up against U.S. Rep. Diane Black, Knoxville businessman Randy Boyd and House Speaker Beth Harwell\u2014 two opponents who spent more campaign cash and had more political experience than Lee, who has never before ran for public office.\n\nLee courted voters by traveling the state twice in an RV in a tour he called \u201cBelieve in Tennessee.\u201d He visited all of Tennessee\u2019s 95 counties in 95 days, and often chose smaller rural political events over sharing the stage with Dean.\n\nHis campaign remained overwhelmingly positive, but he has faced criticism for providing scant details on key policy positions.\n\nAs his Democratic opponent campaigned heavily on the need to expand Tennessee\u2019s Medicaid eligibility to improve health care access across the state, Lee steadfastly opposed the plan.\n\nInstead, Lee promised to work to fix the state\u2019s health care system, calling it a long-term project that may take 15-20 years. However, unlike Dean, the Republican says he would ultimately lobby the Tennessee Legislature to vote against Medicaid expansion, should lawmakers ever get close to doing so.\n\nLee also says he supports school choice, a position his opponents say will result in public funds being funneled toward private schools. He hasn\u2019t offered details about what policy options he\u2019ll rule out as governor.\n\nLee chairs his family business, Lee Company, a $225 million mechanical contracting, facilities and home services firm with more than 1,200 employees. Lee also is active in his 1,000-acre family cattle operation.\n\nLee later told reporters after his speech that he will consider appointing Democrats to his administration. \u201cI want to put together a team that is the best team that can be assembled to bring about real change.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to speak just a minute to those who may not have voted for me - I want them to know from the bottom of my heart I care about you and I care about your families,\u201d Lee said. \u201cI want you to ultimately be proud that I am your governor.\u201d\n\nHe added that his priorities starting out in office will be economic development for rural communities, criminal justice reforms that will create safer neighborhoods, and education reform, with a focus on vocational and technical education.\n\n\u201cBill Lee is a man with strong character and love for our state and will make the right decisions to keep Tennessee moving forward,\u201d Haslam said in a statement. \u201cI am excited to see what this state will accomplish under his leadership.\u201d\n\nDean conceded shortly after the race was called, and urged Tennesseans to support the new governor-elect. It was the first time the former two-term Nashville mayor and former elected public defender had ever lost an election.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t quite reach the goal tonight,\u201d Dean told supporters in Nashville during his concession speech. \u201cDespite everybody\u2019s hard work, our message didn\u2019t quite carry the day.\u201d\n\nVoters who backed Lee said his campaign style stood out.\n\n\u201cBill didn\u2019t go onto the attack,\u201d said Sandi Wells, 62, who voted for Lee in Williamson County. \u201cHe just talked issues with people. And that\u2019s what I think we want.\u201d\n\nWells leads a weekly coffee gathering in which politics is discussed in Williamson County, the upscale Nashville suburb and Republican stronghold.

Joe Manchin, D-W.V., right, celebrates his win over Patrick Morrisey for the U.S. Senate seat from West Virginia during an election evening event, Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2018, at the Embassy Suites in Charleston, W.V. (F, Brian Ferguson/Charleston Gazette-Mail via AP)\n\nCHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) \u2014 Democrat Joe Manchin pushed back against the popularity of President Donald Trump in his own state to win his second full term in the U.S. Senate.\n\nManchin endured the toughest campaign in his three-plus decades in West Virginia politics, defeating Republican state attorney general Patrick Morrisey on Tuesday.\n\nManchin, his voice cracking from a two-day motorcycle ride across the state Sunday and Monday to promote his campaign, told supporters in his victory speech, \u201cYou made history tonight. This is truly a win for West Virginia.\u201d\n\nMorrisey was a staunch supporter of Trump, the GOP president who became popular in Appalachia for making broad promises to put coal miners back to work despite grim economic forecasts for the industry. Despite registered Democrats far outnumbering Republicans in West Virginia, the state gave Trump his largest margin of victory \u2014 42 percentage points \u2014 in 2016. He visited the state three times in recent months to rally for Morrisey.\n\n\u201cI never expected this race to be the national race it turned out to be,\u201d Manchin said. \u201cI never expected President Trump to come to this state as much as he did, sending Vice President (Mike) Pence, sending his family time after time after time. And you stood tall. What West Virginia said loud and clear tonight: Mr. President, we want our senator, not your senator.\u201d\n\nManchin went a step further, urging a stop to \u201cthis absolute toxic rhetoric that\u2019s going on in this country. We\u2019ve got to bring people together. Mr. President, I want you to be the president of the United States, not the president of the divided states.\u201d\n\nDespite the scolding, Manchin has worked hard to cozy up to Trump, too, while nurturing a bipartisan brand.\n\nPortraying himself as loyal to his home state rather than party ideology, Manchin was the only Senate Democrat to vote to confirm U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. Morrisey said Manchin lacked leadership on the nomination, calling him \u201cSideline Joe\u201d for waiting until the very end to announce his vote.\n\nThe 50-year-old Morrisey called himself a true conservative while his campaign accused Manchin of being \u201ca dishonest Washington liberal who only acts bipartisan around election day ...\u201d\n\nIn his concession speech, Morrisey said \u201ctonight we may have fallen a little bit short.\u201d He told supporters that \u201cyour blood, sweat and tears mean a lot to me.\u201d\n\nA popular former governor, Manchin made maintaining health care protections for pre-existing conditions a major focus of his campaign and has hit Morrisey for joining a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nManchin also questioned Morrisey\u2019s past ties in Washington, D.C., as a lobbyist for the pharmaceutical industry \u2014 West Virginia leads the nation in the rate of drug overdose deaths. He also criticized Morrisey\u2019s roots in New Jersey, where he lost a 2000 congressional race.\n\nAmong voters, Democrat Everett Neville of Milton said he supported Manchin because \u201che\u2019s worked hard for West Virginia so far, even when he was governor.\n\nFormer Democratic state lawmaker Larry Linch of Clarksburg said he was concerned about Manchin\u2019s support of Kavanaugh but voted for Manchin anyway.\n\nManchin \u201ccauses me concern at times, but I\u2019ve known him for 25 years,\u201d Linch said. \u201cI know he kind of plays the field, but I think that\u2019s what we need, more of them jumping from one side to another and not being staunch along political lines.\u201d\n\nThe 71-year-old Manchin earned the backing of teacher unions after he supported them during a statewide strike earlier this year. He chided Morrisey for calling the strike \u201cunlawful\u201d and for saying his office was prepared to support authorities with legal remedies.\n\nManchin far outraised Morrisey in campaign contributions during the campaign.\n\nMorrisey was hoping to give West Virginia two Republican U.S. senators for the first time since 1958, when John D. Hoblitzell, Jr. was appointed to serve a year after the death of Democrat Matthew M. Neely, and two elected GOP senators for the first time since 1929.

The majority are Hispanic immigrants drawn to work at its the two meatpacking plants. Dodge City drew national headlines when just weeks before the election its local election official moved the lone polling site to a facility outside of town, citing planned construction.\n\nOn Tuesday, volunteers from cities as far flung as San Diego, Boston, New York, Denver and other cities came to make sure Dodge City residents could vote, , said Johnny Dunlap, chairman of the Ford County Democratic Party.\n\n\u201cWe had more drivers and buses than we needed, so the challenge wasn\u2019t so much the physical rides,\u201d Dunlap said. \u201cWe had it covered.

They have gotten at least 17 complaints about that from Dodge City voters.\n\nAmong them is Alex Aldape, a 34-year-old Hispanic delivery driver who was born in Dodge City and has lived there nearly all his life. He was told he had to cast a provisional ballot on Election Day because although his voter registration had the correct address, his driver\u2019s license had an old address. His wife, who is white, had no trouble voting using her driver\u2019s license even though it also their same old address.\n\nAldape said all the people filling out provisional ballots at a table were Hispanic.

The district tilts Republican, so the outcome wasn\u2019t a surprise; Rogers won re-election two years ago by a more than 30-point margin.\n\nRogers campaigned on maintaining a healthy economy and reducing federal regulations, two themes that resonate with conservative voters who back President Donald Trump. He also talked about supporting the military, tax cuts, and replacing the health care law signed by former President Barack Obama.\n\n\u201cWe need to find a way of getting back to replacing Obamacare with something that is not a drag on the economy. That\u2019s the number one issue for me, and then right behind it: We\u2019ve got to continue to rebuild our military and strengthen it,\u201d Rogers said before the election.\n\nHagan, of Opelika, was crowned Miss America in 2013. Campaigning in a district that includes the university town of Auburn, she advocated improvements to education, health care, equality and career-training programs, and she charged that Rogers lost touch with voters after being in Washington so long.\n\n\u201cThe thing that I\u2019ve been hearing the most is that people don\u2019t think Mike Rogers listens to them, that he\u2019s not an accessible representative,\u201d Hagan, 29, said during one campaign appearance.

Michigan won 42-7. (AP Photo/Tony Ding)\n\nMichigan moved into the fourth spot of the College Football Playoff rankings Tuesday night, behind Alabama, Clemson and Notre Dame.\n\nGeorgia was next at five, followed by Oklahoma.\n\nThe playoff picture cleared up after a weekend where several contenders asserted themselves. The top-four teams in the final rankings Dec. 2 will play in the national semifinals.\n\nThe Crimson Tide easily dispatched LSU from the top four, beating the Tigers 29-0. LSU, though, only dropped to No. 7 after its second loss, ahead of Washington State, West Virginia and Ohio State \u2014 all with only one loss.\n\nSelection committee chairman Rob Mullens noted LSU\u2019s three victories against teams the committee has ranked this week (Mississippi State, Auburn and Georgia).\n\n\u201cTheir defense is extremely strong,\u201d said Mullens, the Oregon athletic director. \u201cTheir two losses come against No. 1 Alabama, on the road to Florida.\u201d\n\nUnbeaten Notre Dame moved up one spot to No. 3, and Michigan jumped a spot after a 42-7 victory against Penn State.\n\nWith four weeks left in the season, nine of the top 10 teams are serious contenders. LSU is basically out, because the Tigers have no chance to win a conference title.\n\nAssuming the top three unbeaten teams would get in by winning out, here are the paths to the playoff.\n\nNo. 1 Alabama (9-0)\n\nThe Tide is already locked into the SEC championship game and has built up enough equity that even a regular-season loss to Mississippi State or Auburn won\u2019t keep Tua Tagovailoa and Co. out of the playoff. Now if they lost twice ... yeah, that\u2019s probably not happening. The only intrigue involving Alabama is whether the Tide could lose the SEC championship game, finish 12-1 and still get in? The chances are probably decent.\n\nNo. 2 Clemson (9-0)\n\nLike Alabama, the Tigers have some room for a regular-season misstep, but their position is not a strong as the Tide\u2019s. With a loss to ACC Atlantic rival Boston College on Saturday, Clemson would be at risk of being shut out of the conference title game. Ohio State and Alabama both made the playoff at 11-1, without even playing for a league title the last two seasons. The Tigers could, too, but it is no slam dunk.\n\nNo. 3 Notre Dame (9-0)\n\nThe Irish finish with three winnable games, but no locks. Notre Dame fans believe their team holds a trump card against Michigan, with that season-opening victory in South Bend. That could buffer the Irish against one loss in their final three games, but with no conference title and some struggling marquee teams on their schedule such as Virginia Tech and Stanford, Notre Dame is not a lock if it gets into a resume contest with other one-loss teams. Even one it beat.\n\nNo. 4 Michigan (8-1)\n\nThe Wolverines have to feel good about controlling their path to the playoff. Winning out, including at Ohio State, puts Jim Harbaugh\u2019s team at 12-1 with a Big Ten title. That\u2019s a resume with victories against Michigan State, Wisconsin and Penn State, and a seven-point road loss to Notre Dame. One loss and Michigan is out, right? Not so fast. Take a quick glance at the rankings and notice how many highly ranked teams still have to play each other. It won\u2019t take more than one or two mild upsets to have the selection committee sifting through a bunch of two-loss teams to fill the final playoff spot. Figure the ones with conference championships will have the edge.\n\nNo. 5 Georgia (8-1)\n\nSimple: Win out, get in. Oh, and beat Alabama. The good news for the Bulldogs is beating Alabama to win the SEC championship would almost certainly make up for a second regular-season loss. Georgia has got a little leeway when it faces Auburn and Georgia Tech.\n\nNo. 6 Oklahoma (8-1)\n\nUCLA did the Sooners no favor by being terrible and depriving Oklahoma of a quality nonconference victory. Still, the Sooners are probably the Big 12\u2032s best bet to win an argument against a one-loss Big Ten champion or Notre Dame with one loss. Maybe.\n\nNo. 8 Washington State (8-1)\n\nThe Cougars could finish as 12-1 champions of the weakest Power Five conference and no notable nonconference victories. The most realistic scenario to put Mike Leach\u2019s Washington State team in the playoff involves Big Ten and Big 12 implosions.\n\nNo. 9 West Virginia (7-1)\n\nThe weather did the Mountaineers no favor by forcing the cancellation of West Virginia\u2019s game at North Carolina State in September. The Mountaineers do have a victory against Tennessee on a neutral field. Not terrible. To get to 11-1 and a Big 12 title could mean two victories over Oklahoma in consecutive weekends.\n\nNo. 10 Ohio State (8-1)\n\nThe Buckeyes found out last season that getting hammered by a team that finished the regular season 7-5 is deal-breaker with the committee when it comes time to make a tough choice. Ohio State could win out \u2014 beating Michigan State and Michigan along the way \u2014 and get in. But that\u2019s a long way from certain considering the Buckeyes are the lowest ranked one-loss team.\n\nNo. 12 UCF (8-0)\n\nThe Knights stayed at No. 12 after beating Temple 52-40 last week.\n\n\u201cStrong offense, struggling on defense,\u201d Mullens said.\n\nAthletic director Danny White and the Knights fans certainly don\u2019t want to hear this, but another perfect season probably won\u2019t even get UCF seriously considered for a spot in the semifinal \u2014 unless things get really weird.\n\nSo let\u2019s think weird: Northwestern wins the Big Ten, Arizona State wins the Pac-12, Iowa State wins the Big 12, Pitt wins the ACC, Notre Dame losses two of its final three and Georgia losses to both Auburn and Alabama. That\u2019s extreme, but if three of those six things happen, UCF probably gets a look.\n\n____\n\nFollow Ralph D.

Dianne Feinstein, rejecting her challenger, a Democratic state senator from Los Angeles. In the contest for governor, California voters elected a Democratic heavyweight over a Republican businessman who has never held elected office.\n\nDemocrats were also seeking to win as many as seven GOP U.S. House seats as part of their bid to retake control of Congress. Several of those races remained too close to call early Wednesday.\n\nHere\u2019s a snapshot of who voted and why in California, based on preliminary results from AP VoteCast, an innovative nationwide survey of about 139,000 voters and nonvoters \u2014 including 3,769 voters and 617 nonvoters in the state of California \u2014 conducted for The Associated Press by NORC at the University of Chicago.\n\n___\n\nRACE FOR SENATE\n\nCalifornia voters granted Feinstein her fifth full term in the Senate. The 85-year old overcame a challenge from state Sen. Kevin de Leon, 51, who argued she hasn\u2019t been tough in confronting President Donald Trump.\n\nFeinstein had an apparent advantage over de Leon among white voters.\n\nWhites with a college education modestly supported Feinstein and those without a college degree were split.\n\nFeinstein had a sizable advantage among black voters. Hispanic voters were split.\n\nVoters under 45 were divided in their support. Those ages 45 and older appeared to prefer Feinstein.\n\nShe also drew strong support from women. Some 58 percent of women voted for Feinstein, while 41 percent voted for de Leon.\n\nVoters who felt the country is headed in the wrong direction were also more likely to vote for Feinstein than de Leon.\n\nFeinstein, whom voters first sent to Washington in 1992, won another six-year term in the Senate even though 8 in 10 California voters said they disapprove of the job Congress is doing.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s primary system allows two members of the same political party to face each other in a general election.\n\nStill, Feinstein drew the national spotlight this fall during the fiery confirmation battle over Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. A California woman sent Feinstein a letter during the summer accusing Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her in high school, which he denied.\n\nFeinstein kept the letter confidential for weeks but later turned it over to the FBI. Trump and Republicans accused her of leaking the letter to the press in an attempt to derail Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation.\n\n___\n\nRACE FOR GOVERNOR\n\nCalifornia\u2019s race for governor ended with Democratic Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom defeating Republican businessman John Cox.\n\nNewsom defeated Cox with a pledge to spur a rapid bump in housing construction, bring about universal health care and help impoverished children. Cox focused his campaign relentlessly on California\u2019s high cost of living, blaming Newsom and the Democrats who control the Legislature and every statewide office.\n\nNewsom will replace Gov. Jerry Brown, one of Trump\u2019s chief antagonists.\n\nThe former San Francisco mayor led Cox among voters under and older than age 45.\n\nBlack and Hispanic voters preferred Newsom. White voters overall were split over Newsom and Cox.\n\nWhites without a college degree were also divided over the two gubernatorial candidates. White college graduates appeared to prefer Newsom.\n\nAmong voters who backed Newsom, 85 percent wanted the health care law to be either left as is or expanded. Among voters who disapprove of Trump\u2019s job performance, 81 percent supported Newsom.\n\nThe job was open because Brown is termed out. The 80-year-old Brown has been governor for 16 years, first from 1975 to 1983 and then again starting in 2011 after completing a remarkable political comeback.\n\nNewsom, 51, had been strongly favored as the GOP has 3.8 million fewer registered voters in California.\n\n___\n\nTOP ISSUE: HEALTH CARE\n\nHealth care was at the forefront of voters\u2019 minds: Some 26 percent of respondents named it as the most important issue facing the nation in this year\u2019s midterm elections.\n\nLawrence Reh, a retired writer who lives in the San Francisco Bay Area city of Alameda, is among those voters who cited health care as a key issue.\n\nThe 76-year-old said health care is \u201ca human right,\u201d and the government has a responsibility to provide it.\n\n\u201cNov. 7 will be an important day for me because if we don\u2019t make any progress in this election, I don\u2019t know where we\u2019ll go from here,\u201d Reh said.\n\nOther key issues for Californians this election: Some 19 percent considered the economy the most important issue, while another 19 percent named immigration.\n\nThe environment was the main issue for 11 percent of voters, while gun policy was top of mind for 9 percent California voters.\n\n___\n\nSTATE OF THE ECONOMY\n\nCalifornia voters have a positive view of the nation\u2019s current economic outlook, with 58 percent saying the nation\u2019s economy is excellent/good, compared with 41 percent who said it\u2019s not.\n\nIn California, the economy has been growing, surpassing that of the United Kingdom earlier this year to become the world\u2019s fifth largest.\n\nThe state has enjoyed more than eight straight years of employment increases, California\u2019s second-longest expansion since World War II. The jobless rate slid to a record low 4.1 percent in September and the state\u2019s rural and agricultural areas are seeing historically low unemployment.\n\nStill, California\u2019s high cost of living is driving both employers and employees out of state or to cheaper areas within California.\n\nFor Richard and Aleshia Murphy, a couple who lives in Lakewood, just south of Los Angeles, the economy was the No. 1 issue that motivated them to vote.\n\n\u201cI want to keep things going,\u201d said Richard Murphy, a Republican train operations manager. \u201cMy work feels the booming economy. We\u2019re hiring more people, all positions, from the bottom to the top.\u201d\n\n___\n\nTRUMP FACTOR\n\nA majority of voters in California had negative views of President Donald Trump, with some 71 percent saying they disapprove of how he is handling his job as president. In contrast, 28 percent said they approve of Trump\u2019s job performance.\n\nAbout 52 percent said they voted to express opposition to the president, while 16 percent said that they went to the polls to show their support for Trump. Another 31 percent of California voters said Trump was not a factor they considered when casting their votes.\n\nOpposition to Trump motivated Theresa Hunter of Lake Forest, California, to vote for Democrats.\n\n\u201cI voted blue all the way,\u201d said Hunter, a 65-year-old retired salesperson. \u201cHe was a cult figure. He was not a leader.\u201d\n\nMore than 60 percent of the votes cast in California during the 2016 presidential election went for Hillary Clinton.\n\nWith the aid of a majority in the state Legislature, Gov. Jerry Brown has taken a combative stance against Trump and his policies on immigration, health care and the environment.\n\n___\n\nCONTROL OF CONGRESS\n\nTuesday\u2019s elections determined control of Congress in the final two years of Trump\u2019s first term in office. Some 70 percent of California voters said which party will hold control was very important as they considered their vote. Another 21 percent of voters said it was somewhat important.\n\nCalifornians were casting votes to fill 53 seats in the House of Representatives and one in the Senate. Democrats were targeting a string of GOP-held districts in California that were carried by Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. Four of those seats are completely or partly in Orange County, a one-time GOP stronghold.\n\nPatrick Louie, a government analyst who voted Friday near the California Capitol in Sacramento, said he filled out his ballot this year with the intention of putting a check on Trump.\n\nThe 67-year-old Democrat said he doesn\u2019t think Congress is doing enough to push back against Trump and that the government is very divided.\n\n\u201cI think it reflects on, not only the Republicans, who I think are more self-interested, as well as the president, who I don\u2019t believe has the best interests of the country in his mind,\u201d Louie said.\n\nStill, Louie was also pressing for change among the Democrats in the U.S. Senate. He voted for de Leon because the state senator is a generation younger than Feinstein.\n\n\u2033(It\u2019s) time to bring a new perspective to the Senate,\u201d he said. \u201cI know we\u2019re giving up some seniority, but somewhere along the line we have to make the switch. I think this is a good time.\u201d\n\n___\n\nSTAYING AT HOME\n\nIn California, 73 percent of registered voters who chose not to vote in the midterm elections were younger than 45. A wide share of those who did not vote \u2014 78 percent \u2014 did not have a college degree. Some 46 percent of nonvoters were Democrats, while 19 percent were Republicans.\n\n___\n\nAP VoteCast is a survey of the American electorate in all 50 states conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago for The Associated Press and Fox News.

(AP) \u2014 Clemson coach Brad Brownell\u2019s not quite ready to count on exploding scoreboards and splashy offensive outbursts for the 22nd-ranked Tigers just yet.\n\nMarcquise Reed had 20 points and a career-high 13 rebounds as Clemson beat The Citadel 100-80 and reached 100 points for the first time in nine years Tuesday night.\n\nReed led six Tigers in double figures as they hit the century mark for the first time since a 102-66 win over Winthrop in November 2009, a season before Brownell arrived.\n\nBut Clemson\u2019s ninth-year coach believes the result was due more to the Bulldogs\u2019 desire to pick up the pace and shoot often rather than his team\u2019s ability to light things up.\n\n\u201cWe certainly have some guys that can score,\u201d Brownell said. \u201cCertainly, Marcquise and Shelton (Mitchell), that\u2019s what they do. Last year\u2019s team with everybody there was probably more potent than now. But we\u2019re hoping to get there.\u201d\n\nThis was certainly a good start for a team coming off an appearance in the NCAA Tournament\u2019s Sweet 16.\n\nReed led six Tigers in double figures and posted his fourth career double-double. Shelton Mitchell and Aamir Simms scored 16 points each, Elijah Thomas had 15, Clyde Trapp 13 and David Skara 11.\n\n\u201cThey went to the Sweet 16 for a reason,\u201d Bulldogs coach Duggar Baucom said.\n\nClemson had only reached 90 points six previous times in Brownell\u2019s first eight seasons, four of those times coming in 2016-17 when high-scoring Jaron Blossomgame led the way.\n\nAsked if this was the start of a trend for the typically defensive- minded Tigers, Reed smiled and said, \u201cHopefully.\u201d\n\nThe Citadel didn\u2019t make things easy on the Tigers down the stretch. The Bulldogs cut an 18-point, second-half deficit to 80-71 on Lew Stallworth\u2019s layup with 6:38 remaining. But Mitchell followed with a 3-pointer and two foul shots to restore the Tigers\u2019 double-digit lead.\n\nThe Citadel could not respond and fell to 0-52 all-time against ranked opponents.\n\nClemson is coming off its strongest season of Brownell\u2019s tenure, winning 25 games with a program-record 11 Atlantic Coast Conference victories. The Tigers reached the round of 16 for the first time in 21 years last season, and they revealed a banner in the rafters of Littlejohn Coliseum commemorating the achievement.\n\nStallworth had 15 points to lead the Bulldogs. Matt Frierson had 12 points off four of the team\u2019s 10 3-pointers.\n\nThe Citadel made 12 3-pointers per game last season to rank second nationally.\n\nThe Citadel hit five of its seven first-half 3-pointers in the first nine minutes and led the Tigers 24-21. Clemson closed the period on a 28-16 run to lead 49-40 at the break.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nThe Citadel: The Bulldogs will get a heavy dose of the road to start the season. Three of their next five games are away from home, including stops at Texas, James Madison and South Florida.\n\nClemson: The Tigers should have several more warmups the next few games. Clemson might not face a Power Five team for at least two weeks when it heads to the Cayman Islands Classic and could play Georgia in the second round.\n\nTHOMAS TOUGHS IT OUT\n\nMarcquise Reed said the Tigers were certain senior forward Elijah Thomas would miss the game with an ankle injury after watching him go just 20 minutes in the team\u2019s last practice. Instead, Thomas told coach Brad Brownell he wanted to try and play. Thomas responded with 15 points, nine rebounds and two assists in 24 minutes. Brownell said he was proud of Thomas because doctors said his bone bruise is very painful.\n\nLANDMARK WIN\n\nThe victory was Brad Brownell\u2019s 150th at Clemson, a landmark considering he was a coach with one of the hottest seats in the country when the 2017-18 season began. Brownell is third all-time in Clemson wins behind Cliff Ellis (177) and Bill Foster (156).\n\nUP NEXT\n\nThe Citadel starts its home season against Mid-Atlantic Christian on Monday night.\n\nClemson plays its second straight home game when it faces North Carolina Central on Friday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "CHICAGO (AP) \u2014 Health care was the top issue cited by Minnesota voters in the midterm election and most believe the country is headed in the wrong direction, according to a wide-ranging survey of the American electorate.\n\nAs voters cast ballots for governor, U.S. Senate and members of Congress in Tuesday\u2019s elections, AP VoteCast found that about two-thirds of Minnesota voters said the country is headed in the wrong direction, while about a third said it was on the right track.\n\nHere\u2019s a snapshot of who voted and why in Minnesota, based on preliminary results from AP VoteCast, an innovative nationwide survey of about 135,000 voters and nonvoters \u2014 including 4,167 voters and 671 nonvoters in the state of Minnesota \u2014 conducted for The Associated Press by NORC at the University of Chicago.\n\n___\n\nTOP ISSUE: HEALTH CARE\n\nHealth care was at the forefront of voters\u2019 minds: More than one-third of Minnesota voters named it as the most important issue facing the nation in this year\u2019s midterm elections, followed by immigration, cited by about 2 in 10 voters.

Villanova\u2019s on-campus court underwent a $65 million facelift that would have made the Property Brothers jealous.\n\nThe Wildcats couldn\u2019t put a price tag on their sweetest accessory \u2014 the 2018 national championship banner raised high above midcourt. Under Wright, Villanova has won two of the last three national championships, and seating for this season is at a premium. StubHub had lower level tickets selling for $375 shortly before tip, and a gym that for three decades had a skeleton crew of concession stands suddenly had deep-pocketed donors noshing on fried shrimp, $10 Wildcat burgers and taking a nip of top-shelf booze.\n\n\u201cMan, it was loud, it was jumping the whole time,\u201d Wright said. \u201cI thought the crowd was great. There\u2019s a different vibe in here. It\u2019s definitely louder.

(Capel) talks a lot about playing with energy. We\u2019re going to make mistakes but obviously we\u2019re going to learn from them.\u201d\n\nDuring one 10-second sequence in the first half Johnson blew a dunk, raced back on defense, grabbed a rebound and rather than flip the ball ahead to Kene Chukwuka for an easy layup took it up the floor himself. His attempt to wrap the ball behind his back ended up with the ball sailing out of bounds due to a turnover, and yet he remained in the game.\n\n\u201cI think if you\u2019re going to allow guys to have freedom then you have to allow them to make mistakes as long as they\u2019re mistakes going hard,\u201d Capel said. \u201cWe certainly made some mistakes and it wasn\u2019t just those guys, it was everyone, it was me. But those guys were playing hard. You allow them to grow. You allow them to fix it.\u201d\n\nTaking over a program that went 0-19 in the ACC last year, Capel cautioned it will take time for the Panthers to climb their way back into relevance in arguably the nation\u2019s toughest conference. He stressed there are no shortcuts and his starting lineup may have indicated his commitment to a long-term rebuild, though the first step ended with Pitt picking up its first victory in 319 days.\n\nThe Panthers sent three freshmen \u2014 Johnson, McGowens and Au\u2019Diese Toney onto the floor \u2014 and Capel substituted liberally trying to get a feel for what he has on his hands.\n\nMalik Ellison, a transfer from St. John\u2019s, scored 13 for Pitt as the Panthers used a 12-0 run early in the second half to take control after the Penguins briefly tied the game at 27. Chukwuka provided a jolt off the bench, finishing with seven points and eight rebounds.\n\n\u201cHe gave us energy,\u201d Capel said. \u201cThat\u2019s who Kene has been since I\u2019ve been here. I thought his energy on both ends of the court helped us break the game open.\u201d\n\nKendale Hampton had 15 points off the bench for Youngstown State but the Penguins shot just 27 percent (18 of 67) from the field, including 8 of 38 3-pointers.\n\nYoungstown State actually had more turnovers (20) than made baskets. Pitt wasn\u2019t much better for long stretches but was never threatened after a Johnson-fueled burst put the Panthers up double digits.\n\n\u201cWe had been averaging close to 35 or 40 (3-point attempts in scrimmages),\u201d Penguins coach Jerrod Calhoun said. \u201cIf you make seven or eight more or even five more, it\u2019s a different ballgame.\u201d\n\nWILSON-FRAME OUT\n\nThe Panthers played without senior forward Jared Wilson-Frame, suspended one game for a violation of team rules.\n\nThe absence of Wilson-Frame, the leading scorer last season on a team that went winless in the Atlantic Coast Conference, gave Capel a chance to experiment extensively with his lineup. Toney had 12 points and nine rebounds while starting in place of Wilson-Frame, though Capel said Wilson-Frame will be back with the team on Friday against VMI.\n\nEARLY AND UGLY\n\nThe college season started a week earlier than usual, and the rustiness showed. It wasn\u2019t just the turnovers. Capel counted at least a handful of layups the Panthers missed and flow was hard to come by.\n\n\u201cIt was like going to the dentist,\u201d Calhoun said. \u201cIt was painful to watch.\u201d\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nYoungstown State: The Penguins are in the midst of a rebuild of their own under Calhoun. Youngstown State has just four players back from a team that was 8-24 last season. Calhoun is committed to having his team chuck it from deep, though a couple more 8 for 38 performances might force him to reconsider.\n\nPitt: Capel\u2019s arrival brings energy and the schedule over the opening weeks isn\u2019t exactly daunting. The Panthers don\u2019t play a Power 5 team until facing Iowa in three weeks as part of the Big Ten/ACC Challenge. By then Capel may have some semblance of a rotation.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nYoungstown State: Faces Akron in Cleveland on Saturday as part of the Northeast Ohio Coaches vs. Cancer Classic.\n\nPitt: Welcomes Virginia Military Institute on Friday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) \u2014 Tom Wolf won a second term as governor on Tuesday, beating brash Republican challenger Scott Wagner and sending the Democrat back for another four years to share power with a GOP-controlled Legislature.\n\nWolf has said he will continue advancing his first-term priorities, including trying to fix funding inequities in Pennsylvania\u2019s public schools and seeking to impose a severance tax on the Marcellus Shale natural gas industry. But he will be up against Republican lawmakers who fought two extended budget battles with him, blocked many of his top priorities and forced him to lower his expectations.\n\nEven so, Wolf\u2019s re-election will give Democrats a seat at the table for the first time in 30 years when Pennsylvania draws a new map of congressional districts after the 2020 Census.\n\nIn the state\u2019s hotly contested congressional races, Democrats picked up three seats, bringing Pennsylvania\u2019s U.S. House delegation to a 9-9 tie and giving Democrats in the state their most seats in eight years.\n\nPennsylvania\u2019s 18-member congressional delegation also will have four women, the most that have ever represented the state at one time.\n\nDemocratic U.S. Sen. Bob Casey won a third term, beating back a challenge from U.S. Rep. Lou Barletta, the Republican former mayor of Hazleton.\n\nMeanwhile, Pennsylvania recorded its highest midterm turnout in nearly 25 years.\n\nWolf, speaking to supporters in York on Tuesday night, said Pennsylvanians voted for a state \u201cthat has a really bright future\u201d and \u201cfor a public service that actually has integrity, that you can trust.\u201d\n\nIn brief remarks, Wolf said people had voted for better lives, better schools, a strong economy, access to quality and affordable health care and a fairer Pennsylvania for everyone, regardless of race, gender or religion.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of what we\u2019ve already done together,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cBut four years ago I stood before you and said, \u2018You know, we have a lot of work to do, so let\u2019s get started.\u2019 Tonight, I have basically the same message: We still have a lot of work to do. So let\u2019s back to work, all right?\u201d\n\nThe incumbent ran what analysts called a conservative campaign designed to limit mistakes and take advantage of Wagner\u2019s liabilities.\n\nWolf refused to debate Wagner more than once, and his campaign worked to capitalize on Wagner\u2019s penchant for eyebrow-raising off-the-cuff comments. That included Wagner advising Wolf last month to put on a catcher\u2019s mask because \u201cI\u2019m going to stomp all over your face with golf spikes.\u201d\n\nThe two candidates were studies in contrast. Wolf is soft-spoken and chooses his words carefully. When Wagner announced his candidacy, he declared, \u201cI am going to be the next governor, take that to the bank.\u201d\n\nWagner said he called Wolf to congratulate him on the victory and brought up the issue of school property taxes.\n\n\u201cI did ask Gov. Wolf one thing,\u201d Wagner said. \u201cI said, \u2018Gov. Wolf, I\u2019m asking you to do something about the seniors who are losing their home to taxes.\u2019\u201d\n\nWagner, a 63-year-old former state senator who made millions from his garbage-hauling business, mostly self-financed his campaign. He had promised to cut taxes and rein in an out-of-control state government. But he fought an unexpectedly bruising and expensive three-way primary, and spent considerable time trying to walk back previous comments he had made, including criticisms public schools and teachers, while struggling to exploit a weakness in his opponent.\n\nMeanwhile, Wolf heavily outraised and outspent Wagner, with help from labor unions that Wagner had made the target of some of his sharpest criticisms.\n\nWolf, 69, ran his family\u2019s building products company for most of three decades before becoming governor in 2015, except for a short stint as Pennsylvania\u2019s revenue secretary.\n\nHe has been a champion for liberal causes, including imposing an effective moratorium on the death penalty, defending Pennsylvania\u2019s expansion of Medicaid under the 2010 federal health care law known as \u201cObamacare\u201d and blocking legislation that would have curtailed abortion rights.\n\nJoining Wolf as lieutenant governor will be John Fetterman, the Braddock mayor whose efforts to improve the impoverished town over the past 13 years drew national attention and made him a media darling. Fetterman beat sitting Lt. Gov. Mike Stack in a five-way Democratic primary in May.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "", "", "", "", "", "1 of 7 Tennessee forward Kyle Alexander (11) reacts to dunking the ball over Lenoir-Rhyne forward Emmanuel Wembi (23) during the first half of an NCAA college basketball game Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2018, in Knoxville, Tenn. (AP Photo/Wade Payne)\n\nKNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 Tennessee coach Rick Barnes used to walk down the railroad tracks with his brother and sneak into the gym to watch Lenoir-Rhyne basketball games when he was a kid.\n\nBarnes returned the favor on Tuesday night by welcoming the Bears to his new home at Thompson-Boling Arena, but he didn\u2019t show his alma mater any mercy on the scoreboard.\n\nJordan Bone scored 18 points and Kyle Alexander added 16 as No. 6 Tennessee opened the season with an 86-41 victory over Lenoir-Rhyne.\n\nBarnes lettered for three seasons at Lenoir-Rhyne. Barnes is a native of Hickory, North Carolina, where Lenoir-Rhyne is located. He still closely follows all Lenoir-Rhyne sports and praised the progress head coach Everick Sullivan has made with the basketball program.\n\n\u201cObviously our size and strength was able to get to them, but I do think he is working to do the right things,\u201d Barnes said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good time to be an LR Bear, and I am proud of my college and my university.\u201d\n\nThe game against the Division II opponent counts on Tennessee\u2019s overall record, but Lenoir-Rhyne counted the game as an exhibition.\n\nIn front of a crowd of 16,156, the Volunteers opened a season of heightened expectations. The defending Southeastern Conference co-champions return all five starters, and their No. 6 ranking is their highest ever in the preseason poll.\n\nGrant Williams and Admiral Schofield filled up the stat sheet for the Vols. Williams had 13 points, seven rebounds and five assists. Schofield had 13 points, nine rebounds and four assists.\n\nLenoir-Rhyne\u2019s 3-point shooting kept things close early in the first meeting between the programs. The Bears started out 6 of 10 from beyond the arc, forcing Barnes to call a timeout when R.J. Gunn and Jalen Johnson hit back-to-back 3-pointers to draw within 20-18.\n\nBolstered by a flurry of steals, the Vols emerged from the break on an 8-0 run. Alexander punctuated the spurt with dunk on the break off an alley-oop pass from Jordan Bowden. The Vols led 50-30 at halftime.\n\n\u201cBoth Bone and Grant with their full-court defense kept getting stops at the front,\u201d said Alexander, who finished with four blocked shots. \u201cI remember coming in and not having to play any defense on the first three possessions because Bone and Grant were just doing a great job at the front, so that was really the turning point for us.\u201d\n\nTennessee didn\u2019t let up to start the second half, opening with a 19-0 run that spanned nearly nine minutes. Lenoir-Rhyne burned two timeouts within the first six minutes to try and stem the tide, but Tennessee kept coming in waves.\n\nThroughout the game, the Vols demonstrated its athleticism with high-flying dunks and blocks. Yves Pons, a sophomore from France, brought the fans to their feet midway through the second half with an emphatic swat on one end followed by a putback on the other.\n\nAfter its early 3-point prowess, Lenoir-Rhyne made only one of its last 25 attempts from beyond the arc. The Bears shot only 20.9 percent (14 of 67) from the field overall and didn\u2019t have a player reach double figures in points. Manny Wembi led the Bears with nine.\n\n\u201cIt was like a war of attrition when you are dealing with that size and that athleticism. There is no way our guys can maintain that physicality they are throwing at your unless you are making 3s,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cThat was our game plan, to see if we could make 3s and stay within striking distance. They followed the game plan. They just didn\u2019t make enough shots.\u201d\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nLenoir-Rhyne: The trip to Knoxville was a no-lose situation for the Bears. They got to play a Division I opponent in a major venue and weren\u2019t expected to win. Lenoir-Rhyne gave its players a great experience that won\u2019t impact its overall record. The Bears won\u2019t see a better team all season. \u201cThey understand the ramifications,\u201d Sullivan said of his players. \u201cThere are none.\u201d\n\nTennessee: The Vols are easing into the season with their first two games against Lenoir-Rhyne and Louisiana-Lafayette before a challenging stretch begins with games against Georgia Tech, Louisville and either No. 1 Kansas or Marquette.\n\nINJURY UPDATE\n\nTennessee was shorthanded in the backourt with guards Lamonte\u2019 Turner and Jalen Johnson sitting out with injuries. Barnes said he expects both to play Friday against Louisiana-Lafayette.\n\nKEY STATS\n\nThe Vols outscored the Bears 46-12 in the paint, scored 22 points off turnovers and assisted on 23 of their 34 made baskets.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nLenoir-Rhyne hosts Young Harris on Friday.\n\nTennessee hosts Louisiana-Lafayette on Friday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "MIAMI (AP) \u2014 Sarah Mortensen scored 24 points, leading a 3-point barrage by making 8 of 9, and No. 25 Miami opened the season with a 94-43 win over cross-town rival Florida International on Tuesday night.\n\nMykea Gray added 15 points off the bench and Miami native Beatrice Mompremier had 15 points and 11 rebounds and the transfer from Baylor surpassed 550 points and 450 rebounds for her career in her first game with the Hurricanes.\n\nMiami was 16 of 32 behind the arc, going 13 of 20 in the second half.

When asked about her presidential aspirations during a recent televised debate, Gillibrand said she will serve out her six-year Senate term.\n\nGillibrand, 51, was a congresswoman in eastern New York when she was appointed in 2009 to the Senate seat vacated when Hillary Clinton was named secretary of state. She easily won election in 2010 to serve the remainder of Clinton\u2019s term, and took 72 percent of the vote in 2012 to win a full term.\n\nFarley, also 51, works in the financial services industry and has never held elected office.

Greg Gianforte embraced the president\u2019s agenda and won, but four campaign appearances with Trump failed to help challenger Matt Rosendale unseat Democratic Sen. Jon Tester.\n\nAP VoteCast, a wide-ranging survey of the American electorate, found that voters had mixed views of Trump: 52 percent said they approve of how he is handling his job as president, while 47 percent said they disapprove of Trump.\n\nVoters split evenly on whether the country was on the right or wrong track.\n\nTester won a third term in a tight race; Trump traveled to the state four times to boost Rosendale\u2019s campaign. In the race for the state\u2019s sole House seat, Gianforte kept his job 16 months after winning a special election to finish the term of Ryan Zinke, who left to become Trump\u2019s Interior secretary. Gianforte, best known nationally for assaulting a reporter last year, faced Democrat Kathleen Williams, a former state lawmaker who was one of a record number of women running for office nationwide.\n\nHere\u2019s a snapshot of who voted and why in Montana, based on preliminary results from AP VoteCast, an innovative nationwide survey of about 139,000 voters and nonvoters \u2014 including 2,667 voters and 252 nonvoters in the state of Montana \u2014 conducted for The Associated Press by NORC at the University of Chicago.\n\n___\n\nTOP ISSUE: HEALTH CARE\n\nHealth care was at the forefront of voters\u2019 minds: about 3 in 10 named it as the most important issue facing the nation in this year\u2019s midterm elections. About one-fifth of voters considered the economy paramount, while another fifth picked immigration. Just 1 in 10 voters named the environment, and fewer than that said foreign policy.\n\n___\n\nSTATE OF THE ECONOMY\n\nMontana voters have a positive view of the nation\u2019s economic outlook. Two-thirds said the nation\u2019s economy is good, compared with one-third who said it\u2019s not.\n\nMontana\u2019s unemployment rate is 3.6 percent, a hair under the national rate of 3.7 percent, which is a five-decade low, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nJennifer Rager, 55, recalled that her stomach would twist in knots when she\u2019d hear bad economic news during President Barack Obama\u2019s administration, though the national economy gained 11.6 million jobs and the unemployment rate dropped to below the historical norm during his tenure.\n\nNow, the Bozeman entrepreneur said her concierge business has gotten a boost from Trump\u2019s tax cuts and that she just she feels safer since he became president.\n\n\u201cIt just feels like he\u2019s really trying to do a good job of protecting our country, you know?\u201d Rager said Saturday as she volunteered at a rally for Trump in Belgrade, Montana. \u201cI can\u2019t wrap my head around why the other side is so unhappy and so terrified.\u201d\n\n___\n\nTRUMP FACTOR\n\nFor about one-third of Montana voters, Trump was not a factor they considered while casting their ballots. About one-third said a reason for their vote was to express support for Trump, and the final third said they voted to express opposition to Trump.\n\nVoters in Montana had mixed views of Trump: 47 percent said they approve of his performance, while 52 percent said they disapprove.\n\n\u201cHis rhetoric has divided the country and there\u2019s chaos in the White House, and I\u2019m tired of it,\u201d said Norm Larsen, 69, of Helena. \u201cI think we need strong checks and balances in the Congress.\u201d\n\nWith Democrats winning the House, Larsen hopes they take a close look at Trump\u2019s actions while in office.\n\n\u201cThat may lead to some investigations,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nRACE FOR SENATE\n\nThe votes of women and those 44 and under propelled Tester to victory. While Tester and Rosendale split among voters 45 and over and men, the senator racked up big margins among the young and women.\n\nAmong those 44 and under, Tester bested Rosendale by a 58-39 margin. Among women, Tester received 54 percent of their vote, compared to Rosendale\u2019s 43 percent.\n\nVoters with a college education were more likely to favor Tester. Likewise, voters without a college degree modestly supported him.\n\n___\n\nCONTROL OF CONGRESS\n\nAs Tuesday\u2019s elections determined control of Congress in the final two years of Trump\u2019s first term, roughly two-thirds of Montana voters said which party was in charge was very important as they considered their vote. Another 1 in 5 said it was somewhat important.\n\n___\n\nSTAYING AT HOME\n\nIn Montana, about 8 in 10 registered voters who chose not to vote in the midterm election were younger than 45. A wide share of those who did not vote \u2014 about 9 in 10 \u2014 did not have a college degree. About as many nonvoters were Democrats as Republicans.\n\n___\n\nAP VoteCast is a survey of the American electorate in all 50 states conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago for The Associated Press and Fox News.

(AP Photo/Ray Carlin)\n\nWACO, Texas (AP) \u2014 Fourth-ranked Baylor has all the makings of another standout team in coach Kim Mulkey\u2019s 19th season, and the uncertainty at point guard may already be settled.\n\nThe Lady Bears have one of the best post combos in the nation with 6-foot-7 All-American Kalani Brown and 6-4 Lauren Cox, plenty of good shooters, some standout freshmen and graduate transfer Chloe Jackson at the point.\n\nBaylor opened the season by scoring the first 24 points and matched a school record with seven players in double figures in a 100-39 victory over Nicholls State on Tuesday night.\n\n\u201cFirst game of the season, you\u2019ve got to come out blazing, and we did, we came out more than blazing,\u201d Brown said.\n\n\u201cI thought we started the game very good. It starts with Chloe Jackson,\u201d said Mulkey, the former national championship point guard at Louisiana Tech. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how impressed I am with her. Point guard is the most difficult position on the floor. For her to come here and just grasp everything I\u2019m throwing at her every day and to lead our basketball team, it\u2019s really remarkable.\u201d\n\nJackson, a transfer from LSU, had 10 points and five assists without a turnover in 26 minutes.\n\nWith the graduation of Kristy Wallace and the offseason dismissal of Alexis Morris for an unspecified violation of team rules, the Lady Bears went into preseason practice uncertain of who would be the point guard.\n\nBrown finished with 13 points, matching Moon Ursin for the team high. Brown also had four rebounds while playing only 18 minutes for Baylor, which has won two national titles and the last eight Big 12 regular season titles. All 11 players who saw action scored multiple points and had at least one rebound.\n\nCassidy Barrios had 20 points and nine rebounds for Nicholls State. The senior guard was the leading scorer last season at 17.3 points a game for the Colonels, who were an NCAA Tournament team after winning the Southland Conference tournament. Their season ended with a loss to No. 1 seed Mississippi State.\n\nDiDi Richards set a career-high with 12 points for Baylor, and freshman Caitlin Bickle also had 12. Newcomers Chloe Jackson, NaLyssa Smith and Queen Egbo all had 10 points. Cox had nine points, seven rebounds and a game-high six assists in 19 minutes.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of talent, and we\u2019ve got a lot of them that want to shoot the ball,\u201d Mulkey said. \u201cAs you saw, we can score a lot of points, I can run a lot of different things.\u201d\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nNicholls State: Barrios is one of three returning starters for Nicholls State, which won 19 games last season. The Colonels were overmatched as expected against Baylor. The 5-10 Barrios was the tallest starter going against a Baylor starting five that included Brown, Cox and 6-1 Richards.\n\nBaylor: While the Lady Bears can score a lot of points, Mulkey wasn\u2019t happy after they allowed 61 points in their last exhibition game. \u201cPractice after that game, we pretty much did defense the whole time. It was an emphasis,\u201d Brown said. They held Nicholls to 23 percent shooting (12 of 53) from the field, and had a 48-25 rebounding edge.\n\nLOUISIANA REUNION\n\nThere was a lengthy wait for Mulkey to get to the interview room postgame. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of Louisiana folks in the house,\u201d she said. Mulkey had been visiting with former LSU coaches Dale Brown and Johnny Jones. The Baylor men played afterward against Texas Southern, the team Jones is now coaching. Baylor men\u2019s coach Scott Drew\u2019s father, Homer, was a former Brown assistant.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nNicholls State plays another major conference school on the road.

So I\u2019m loving that,\u201d said Burton, who works at a gas-fired power plant.\n\nOthers simply saw little reason to rock the boat. Gov. Dave Freudenthal appointed Barrasso in 2007 following the death of Sen. Craig Thomas but Barrasso, 66, was well-known as a state legislator and Casper orthopedic surgeon for over a decade before that.\n\n\u201cI thought he\u2019s been pretty good to us,\u201d Tony Gontar, of Cheyenne, said of Barrasso. \u201cHe\u2019s been predictable. You kind of know where he stands on things.\u201d\n\nBarrasso spent over $3 million on his campaign, six times more than Trauner\u2019s $500,000. Barrasso raised $5.5 million to Trauner\u2019s $800,000.\n\nLegislation recently introduced by Barrasso includes a bill to end federal tax credits for electric vehicles.\n\nTrauner, of Jackson Hole, has been chief operating officer of St. John\u2019s Medical Center in Jackson. He previously served on the Teton County school board and co-founded businesses including internet provider OneWest.net and dog food company Mulligan Stew Pet Food.\n\n\u201cWe knew it was a challenge. I did it because of my kids, because they\u2019re worried about their future and I think they should be,\u201d Trauner said. \u201cThe people of Wyoming have spoken.\u201d\n\nTrauner, 59, was the Democratic nominee for Wyoming\u2019s lone U.S. House seat in 2006 and lost to Republican Rep. Barbara Cubin by less than 1 percent. In 2008, Trauner lost to Republican former State Treasurer Cynthia Lummis by a 10-point margin.\n\nGale W. McGee was the last Wyoming Democrat to serve in the U.S. Senate, from 1959-77.\n\nAlso Tuesday, Republican Liz Cheney won a second term, defeating Democratic businessman Greg Hunter of Laramie in a race that drew little attention compared to her previous campaigns.\n\n___\n\nFollow Mead Gruver at https://twitter.com/meadgruver\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "TALLAHASSEE, Fla.

Langford struggled to make his first shot from the floor during the first 10 minutes of the game.\n\nLangford finally made his first field goal with about nine minutes left in the first half and would go on to score the next eight points for Indiana during a four-minute span in which he scored 11 straight points for the Hoosiers.\n\n\u201cI guess that jumper (got me going),\u201d Langford said. \u201cTo see the ball go through the net, that\u2019s all I really need. I just need to see that first shot go down and it\u2019s all good for me from there.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the nerves and anticipation stirring inside Assembly Hall on Tuesday night came with an added level of pressure. But it\u2019s unlikely, considering Langford has lived with and exceeded such pressure and expectations during his high school career. The former five-star recruit was excited to finally get out on the floor in a real game and play with his teammates and fellow freshmen, Langford said.\n\nOnce Langford got into his groove, Indiana\u2019s lead quickly jumped to double-digits and stayed there. Indiana put together a 17-3 run to close out the end of the first half. Langford scored 17 points in the first half and finished the game shooting 7 of 12 from the floor and 5 of 11 from the foul line and added three assists and four rebounds to his debut stat line. Devonte Green scored 15 points, Evan Fitzner finished with 14 points and Justin Smith added 13 for Indiana.\n\n\u201cRomeo was the beneficiary of some very good advance passes . I thought, just in general (especially) in the first half, (Langford) was very efficient,\u201d Hoosiers coach Archie Miller said. \u201cWe have one in the books. It\u2019s always good to get the first one out of the way with a win.\u201d\n\nThe Hoosiers led by as many as 49 points on Tuesday night. Indiana benefited from a variety of Cougars\u2019 mistakes and shortcomings. The Hoosiers scored 25 points off of 20 Chicago State turnovers and outscored the Cougars 54-24 in the paint. Indiana\u2019s bench scored 51 points, just four points fewer than Chicago State\u2019s total.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nLangford and the Hoosiers will have one more contest against a mid-major opponent where they\u2019ll be favorites to win in impressive fashion before they face their first power five programs when the Marquette Golden Eagles come to Bloomington on Nov. 14 and when Indiana travels to Arkansas on Nov. 18.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nIndiana: will host Montana State on Friday.\n\nChicago State: will visit Notre Dame on Thursday.\n\n__________________\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "", "Early results show GOP holding on to some House seats Democrats had hoped to flip; key Senate races still competitive", "1 of 8 Towson guard Tobias Howard (0) passes the ball next to Virginia guard De'Andre Hunter (12) during an NCAA basketball game Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2018, in Charlottesville, Va.

Brooke Paige won the U.S. House nomination along with the nominations to five other statewide GOP offices. But after the primary, Paige turned down all the nominations except that of secretary of state, allowing the party to choose someone for the position.\n\nWelch, of Norwich, traditionally one of the most liberal members of Congress, said Vermont residents must fight what he feels are the disastrous policies of President Donald Trump.

Gina Raimondo, who made the case for a second term by promising voters she would continue Rhode Island\u2019s economic momentum, was re-elected Tuesday, handily beating back a challenge from Allan Fung, the Republican mayor of Cranston.\n\n\u201cTonight, by a resounding victory, the people of Rhode Island said they want to keep going,\u201d she said in her victory speech at the Biltmore Hotel in downtown Providence. \u201cWe want to rebuild our roads. We want to invest in education. We want to create jobs. We want to preserve people\u2019s health care, and we want to preserve our way of life, where there is a place in Rhode Island for everybody.\u201d\n\nFung, in his concession speech, tipped his cap to Raimondo for getting her supporters to turn out. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to take on a machine, but we had the courage and the vision to bring the right kind of change to Rhode Island and speak our mind, and I\u2019m damn proud of that fact,\u201d he said.\n\nDuring the campaign, Raimondo argued that Fung and independent Joe Trillo would take the state backward. She raised more and outspent them by a large margin.\n\nFung, the leader of the state\u2019s second-largest city, tried to portray Raimondo as incompetent and lobbed attacks at her record, including the disastrous rollout of a public benefits computer system under her watch. Fung, who also lost to Raimondo in a three-way race in 2014, proposed lowering the sales tax and slashing business fees and taxes.\n\nTrillo, a former Republican state lawmaker who chaired President Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign in Rhode Island, earned the support of some high-profile Republicans in his independent bid, which prompted the state GOP to complain that Trillo\u2019s campaign was helping Raimondo get re-elected.\n\nAs she turns to her second and final term, Raimondo has said she wants to continue offering tax credits and incentives to attract companies to Rhode Island. She\u2019ll also seek to expand job training programs she started and make larger investments in helping small businesses.\n\nYinka Folami, a public school teacher and registered Democrat in Fung\u2019s home city of Cranston, said the governor\u2019s efforts to invest in public education resonated most with her.\n\nThose include a $250 million bond for school repairs approved by voters Tuesday that Raimondo had championed, as well as plans to expand the state\u2019s free college tuition program so it\u2019s offered at the three public colleges. (Currently it\u2019s offered at just one.)\n\n\u201cEducation is one way for people to rise out of poverty and make something of themselves,\u201d said Folami.\n\nMarcella Mazzenga, a 21-year-old unaffiliated voter in Cranston, said she voted for Raimondo because of her efforts to strengthen the state\u2019s gun laws in the wake of recent mass shootings. The Boston University senior said she felt Fung simply didn\u2019t offer satisfactory solutions to the national epidemic.\n\n\u201cMaking students feel safe is a huge part of it, but there has to be active policy, as well,\u201d Mazzenga said. \u201cWe can\u2019t just have more of the community\u2019s protectors at the schools.\u201d\n\nIn her victory speech, Raimondo touted the state\u2019s economic turnaround.\n\nRhode Island\u2019s unemployment rate recently reached its lowest point in nearly 30 years after having one of the worst in the nation during the recession. The number of jobs based in Rhode Island exceeded 500,000 for the first time in the state\u2019s history in May.\n\nShe also framed her victory as a counterpoint to the national political sentiment.\n\n\u201cNo matter how divisive or negative or filled with anger and hate political discourse is in Washington, that\u2019s not who we are as Rhode Islanders,\u201d Raimondo said. \u201cWe were founded on a principle of tolerance and inclusion. Now is time to hold dear to that value. To rise above that divisiveness and shine through with results.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "", "", "Click to copy\n\nClick to copy https://apnews.com/e9e629617e65431aa4e7332bf79d0e79", "CHICAGO (AP) \u2014 Voters casting midterm election ballots in Texas are divided over the state of the nation, according to a wide-ranging survey of the American electorate.\n\nAs voters cast ballots for governor, U.S. Senate and members of Congress in Tuesday\u2019s elections, AP VoteCast found that almost half of Texas voters said the country is on the right track, while half said the country is headed in the wrong direction.\n\nHere\u2019s a snapshot of who voted and why in Texas, based on preliminary results from AP VoteCast, an innovative nationwide survey of about 135,000 voters and nonvoters \u2014 including 3,711 voters and 827 nonvoters in the state \u2014 conducted for The Associated Press by NORC at the University of Chicago.\n\n___\n\nTOP ISSUE: IMMIGRATION\n\nImmigration was at the forefront of Texas voters\u2019 minds, with 3 in 10 saying it was the most important issue facing the nation in this year\u2019s midterm elections. About one-fifth said health care was most important and another one-fifth said the economy was most important. Gun policy and terrorism also were cited as the top issue, though by lesser margins.\n\nOctavio Rodriguez, 45, a digital business integration manager from Dallas, wore a shirt that read \u201cImmigrant\u201d as he went to the polls on Tuesday morning. Rodriguez was born in Mexico and his family moved here when he was very young. He said he became a U.S. citizen thanks to the immigration reform act signed by President Ronald Reagan.\n\nHe said that the picture being painted of immigration isn\u2019t accurate. \u201cI think there\u2019s a lack of common sense in government overall, and I\u2019m talking about both Republicans and Democrats when I say that,\u201d he said.\n\nTexas\u2019 booming Hispanic population is roughly 11 million and is on pace to outnumber whites as early as 2022. Since 2010, Hispanic population growth in Texas has outpaced whites 3-to-1.\n\n___\n\nSTATE OF THE ECONOMY\n\nEnrique Matta said the economy was one of the issues at the top of his mind when he voted early this election. The software developer, who was born in Puerto Rico, said he did not vote for Trump in 2016, but has approved of the tax cuts and how the president has handled issues around pharmacy drugs.\n\n\u201cEconomically, we\u2019re going in the right direction, but we have so much vitriol between the left and the right,\u201d he said.\n\nOther Texas voters also had a positive view of the nation\u2019s current economic outlook, with 7 in 10 saying the nation\u2019s economy is good, compared with 3 in 10 who said it isn\u2019t.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP FACTOR\n\nFor more than one-third of Texas voters, President Donald Trump was not a factor in how they voted, while more than 6 in 10 said he was.\n\nAmanda Martin, 40, a high school teacher, said she is a Republican but her displeasure with Trump affected her vote.\n\n\u201cI like that Trump is trying to secure the borders but I don\u2019t believe he\u2019s tactful in his relations with how he communicates with the media and he\u2019s not a good face for our country,\u201d Martin said.\n\nTrump won Texas by 9 points in 2016, which made him the first Republican presidential candidate in two decades not to carry Texas by double-digit margins. Virtually all Texas Republicans on the ballot, from Sen. Ted Cruz to Gov. Greg Abbott, have been unwavering in their support of the Trump administration.\n\n___\n\nCONTROL OF CONGRESS\n\nTuesday\u2019s elections will determine control of Congress in the final two years of Trump\u2019s term in office, and three-fourths of Texas voters said that was very important as they considered their vote. Another 2 in 10 said it was somewhat important.\n\nJavier Paz, a 41-year-old public school history teacher, said he volunteered for the Beto O\u2019Rourke campaign against Cruz because he believes O\u2019Rourke can act as a balance against Trump\u2019s policies and on other Republicans who he doesn\u2019t believe hold the president accountable.\n\n\u201cThey really don\u2019t check him on anything,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nAP VoteCast is a survey of the American electorate in all 50 states conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago for The Associated Press and Fox News.

Still, the Los Angeles Dodgers president of baseball operations was willing to acquire the four-time All-Star infielder because his good points outweighed the bad.\n\n\u201cHe got booed in Baltimore three weeks before we traded for him,\u201d Friedman said Tuesday at the general managers\u2019 meetings. \u201cIt\u2019s not like it was a secret. I think it\u2019s never a fun thing to watch, at least from my perspective and vantage point, but I do think it\u2019s important to dig further into that, and I think there are times when guys do that and they don\u2019t really care. And I think there are other times where guys do it and they really do care, and by care I mean the effort they put into their work, the type of teammate they are, and Manny checks all those boxes.\u201d\n\nMachado is among the top two free agents on the market along with outfielder Bryce Harper after a 3\u00bd -month stay with the Dodgers. The 26-year-old was acquired from the Orioles in mid-July and took over the shortstop job that opened when Corey Seager tore an elbow ligament in late April that required season-ending surgery.\n\nMachado hit .273 with 13 homers and 42 RBIs in 66 games, and the Dodgers won their second straight NL pennant. He hit .227 with three homers and 12 RBIs in 16 postseason games, including .182 (4 for 22) with three RBIs in the five-game World Series loss to Boston.\n\nHe kicked Milwaukee first baseman Jesus Aguilar near the ankle as he jogged out a groundout during the NL Championship Series, leading to a $10,000 fine, and was criticized for a pair of hard slides into Brewers shortstop Orlando Arcia, prompting Brewers outfielder Christian Yelich to call Machado \u201ca dirty player.\u201d\n\nMachado stood at home plate watching a fly ball in Game 3 that bounced off a wall and became a 368-foot single, spiked Boston first baseman Steve Pearce in Game 4 and fell to a knee striking out against Chris Sale in Game 5, ending the Dodgers\u2019 second straight World Series loss.\n\n\u201cSo would I rather see more effort as I\u2019m watching? Of course. I think anyone would say that,\u201d Friedman said. \u201cBut I think that in and of itself isn\u2019t as critical of a dynamic as it would be if he didn\u2019t care, if he didn\u2019t put in the work, didn\u2019t put in the effort, and that in our 3 1/2 months of being around him was really strong.\u201d\n\nFriedman would not say how he would fill the void if Farhan Zaidi, the Dodgers general manager and No. 2 baseball operations official for the past four years, left for San Francisco.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll talk about that if it happens,\u201d Friedman said.\n\nHours later, the Giants announced Zaidi as their new president of baseball operations.\n\nFriedman said he is confident the Dodgers will reach a new agreement with Dave Roberts, their manager for the past three seasons.\n\n\u201cThe conversations have been pleasant and they have been ongoing,\u201d Friedman said.\n\n___\n\nAP freelance writer Jay Paris contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "", "", "Democratic U.S. Rep.

The organization argued that only it has \u201cthe right to use the Girl Scouts and Scouts trademark with leadership development services for girls.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, the Boy Scouts said it was reviewing the lawsuit \u201ccarefully.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe applaud every organization that builds character and leadership in children, including the Girl Scouts of the USA, and believe that there is an opportunity for both organizations to serve girls and boys in our communities,\u201d the statement said.\n\nIn May, the Boy Scouts \u2014 the program for 11- to 17-year-olds \u2014 announced it would change its name to Scouts BSA in February.

(AP) \u2014 Democratic Sen. Tom Carper of Delaware won a fourth term in the U.S. Senate on Tuesday, defeating a GOP opponent who was President Donald Trump\u2019s state campaign chair.\n\nCarper\u2019s victory over Republican Rob Arlett, a Sussex County councilman, keeps his unbeaten streak in politics intact. He has never lost an election during more than four decades in politics, starting with his election as state treasurer in 1976.\n\nCarper\u2019s re-election Tuesday comes after he trounced a progressive challenger in a September Democratic primary, stemming an antiestablishment tide hoping to move the Democratic party to the left.\n\nCarper, 71, has staked out a position in Washington as a centrist lawmaker with a strong interest in environmental issues. During the campaign, he touted his experience and his ability to work with lawmakers from both sides of the aisle, despite being a vocal Trump critic.\n\nCarper has said this year\u2019s election was about upholding the government\u2019s system of checks and balances and ensuring Trump does not end up with almost endless powers.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump is an extreme president,\u201d Carper said after a debate last month, adding that Trump has none of the qualities that make a good leader.\n\nCarper nevertheless said it\u2019s still possible for Democrats and Republicans to work together on issues such as infrastructure improvement and the environment. He said his priorities include improving the Affordable Care Act, working to reduce carbon emission from vehicles and developing a comprehensive immigration reform plan.\n\nThe campaign took a nasty turn at a debate last month when Arlett called out Carper for a domestic incident in the early 1980s during which Carper slapped his first wife, Diane, who died in 2013. Carper angrily complained that Arlett and other political opponents have routinely dredged up the incident over the past several decades to try to create \u201cpolitical mischief\u201d for him.\n\nCarper served five terms in the U.S. House and two terms as governor before being elected to the Senate in 2000.\n\nOn the state level, Democratic attorney general candidate Kathleen Jennings has dominated fundraising and spending among all campaigns. She faces Bernard Pepukayi, another Democrat-turned-Republican, in the contest to succeed retiring Democrat Matt Denn.\n\nThe retirement of Republican Tom Wagner, meanwhile, gives Democrats a chance to regain the state auditor\u2019s office for the first time since 1989, with Democrat Kathy McGuinness squaring off against Republican James Spadola.\n\nDemocrats also are hoping to ride a blue wave of fervor against Trump to score an upset in the state treasurer\u2019s race, where incumbent Republican Ken Simpler is being challenged by health care consultant Colleen Davis.\n\nPerhaps the biggest question to be answered Tuesday is whether Republicans can wrest control of the state Senate from Democrats for the first time since 1973. Democrats currently have a razor-thin, 11-10 advantage in the chamber. To flip the table, Republicans would need to hold on to the five GOP-held seats being contested Tuesday and pick up one of the three contested seats held by Democrats. The GOP\u2019s best chance most likely lies in central Delaware\u2019s 17th District, where Republican Justin King, a businessman and mayor of Camden, faces two-term Democratic state Rep. Trey Paradee for the seat left vacant by retiring Democrat Brian Bushweller.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "GOP Rep.

A similar majority \u2014 55 percent \u2014 had negative views of President Donald Trump.\n\nThat made Nevada a bright spot for Democrats in the midterm elections. U.S. Rep. Jacky Rosen, a first-term Democrat from the Las Vegas-area, ousted Republican Sen. Dean Heller, while Steve Sisolak became the first Democrat to win the governor\u2019s office in nearly two decades.\n\nDemocrats also held two open Las Vegas-area congressional seats.\n\nHere\u2019s a snapshot of who voted and why in Nevada, based on preliminary results from AP VoteCast, an innovative nationwide survey of about 138,000 voters and nonvoters \u2014 including 3,423 voters and 617 nonvoters in Nevada \u2014 conducted for The Associated Press by NORC at the University of Chicago.\n\n___\n\nTOP ISSUES\n\nVoters considered several issues to be important to their vote in this midterm election, with about one-quarter picking health care and one-quarter picking immigration as top concerns. About one-fifth identified the economy, while fewer said gun policy or the environment.\n\nFred Hoy, 61, of Reno, said he has diabetes and is on Medicaid, and that he\u2019s been out of work for 13 years but is scraping by to pay his rent and care for several ill family members and friends. Hoy said he voted for Democrats because he\u2019s worried Republicans will cut Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security and threaten protections for pre-existing conditions.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t have some kind of medical, we\u2019re going to collapse as a nation,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nSTATE OF THE ECONOMY\n\nNevada voters have a positive view of the nation\u2019s economic outlook.

By comparison, 27 percent said a reason for their vote was to express support for Trump, and 40 percent said they voted to express opposition to Trump.\n\nA majority of voters in Nevada had negative views of Trump: 54 percent said they disapprove of how he is handling his job as president, while 45 percent said they approve of Trump.\n\nReno resident Dan Lavely said he has voted for Republicans in the past but he refused to cast a ballot for any GOP candidates this time, primarily because of Trump.\n\nLavely, a service manager at a big-box corporate retailer in Sparks, says Trump hasn\u2019t done anything to make his life better. The GOP tax bill was a \u201ctotal joke \u2014 a one-time thing\u201d that had no impact on him, he said. He has mixed feelings about immigration, but he said he doesn\u2019t want to build a wall on or send 2,000 troops to the Mexican border.\n\nThe 62-year-old registered Democrat said he\u2019s doing about the same financially under Trump as he did under former President Barack Obama.\n\n___\n\nRACE FOR SENATE\n\nRosen dominated among self-identified liberals and Heller among conservatives, but moderates broke heavily for Rosen. Rosen also led among urban and suburban voters, while Heller carried those in small towns.\n\nHeller appeared to lead his Democratic rival among white voters. Whites with a college education were divided in their support, and whites without a college degree supported Heller.\n\nRosen had a sizable advantage among black voters and also had a sizable advantage among Hispanic voters.\n\nVoters under 45 supported Rosen; those ages 45 and older were split.\n\n___\n\nRACE FOR GOVERNOR\n\nSisolak had a lead among women, while men slightly preferred his opponent, Republican Attorney General Adam Laxalt.\n\nVoters making more than $50,000 split, while those making less had a clear preference for the Democrat. Sisolak also ran ahead among voters under 45 and urban voters; small-town residents preferred the Republican. Older voters were split.\n\nBlack voters and Hispanic voters preferred Sisolak. White voters overall leaned toward Laxalt.\n\nWhites without a college degree preferred Laxalt. White college graduates were divided in their support.\n\n___\n\nCONTROL OF CONGRESS\n\nTuesday\u2019s elections determined control of Congress in the final two years of Trump\u2019s first term in office, and 7 in 10 voters said which party will hold control was very important as they considered their vote. Another 1 in 5 said it was somewhat important.\n\n___\n\nSTAYING AT HOME\n\nIn Nevada, about three-quarters of registered voters who chose not to vote in the midterm election were younger than 45. A wide share of those who did not vote \u2014 nearly 9 out of every 10 \u2014 did not have a college degree.

Hanebrink said she tried to flag down poll workers and call Anderson County\u2019s election hotline before dialing 911. Poll workers went out after she made her call.\n\nIn Florida and California, some voters assigned to polling stations inside gated communities complained that it took them up to an hour to get their cars past security gates.\n\nElections clerk Rosemarie Reed told WTVJ-TV she was furious to see the long lines in Deerfield Beach, California, and called voting inside a gated community voter suppression. However, Deerfield Beach Commissioner Bernie Parness, who lives inside the gated community, said it was a needed safety measure and minor inconvenience.\n\nRuth Houston waited about half an hour to get to her polling place at Point Dume Club, 3 miles (4.8 kilometers) from her home in Malibu, California.\n\n\u201cVoters had to stop at a security gate to be allowed into the gated neighborhood where our polling place was located,\u201d she said in an email to The Associated Press. \u201cA poll worker told neighborhood managers they needed to open the gate so voters could drive in without talking to security, but management refused claiming opening the gate would be against their policy.\u201d\n\n___\n\nRACISM AND UNREST\n\nVoting was mostly peaceful across the country on Tuesday, but there were a few reported problems, including heated confrontations between poll workers and voters.\n\nIn Texas, a white poll worker was accused of bumping a black voter during an argument at a polling site and suggesting that the voter could better understand her if she\u2019d worn \u201cmy blackface makeup.\u201d\n\nThe Houston Chronicle reported the dispute began over a discrepancy with the voter\u2019s address. The confrontation escalated, and witnesses confirmed to the newspaper that the worker said, \u201cMaybe if I\u2019d worn my blackface makeup today you could comprehend what I\u2019m saying to you.\u201d\n\nThe election judge at the site separated the two. The poll worker was cited for misdemeanor assault.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, a man was accused of threatening to shoot poll workers who told him he wasn\u2019t registered to vote.\n\nMelanie Ostrander, Washington County assistant elections director, said 48-year-old Christopher Thomas Queen, of Claysville, went to a polling place in South Franklin Township on Tuesday morning and became irate when he was told he wasn\u2019t registered.\n\nOstrander said the man \u201ctold the poll workers he was going to go get a gun and come back and shoot them.\u201d He was charged with terroristic threats and disorderly conduct. Court documents don\u2019t list an attorney for him.\n\n___\n\nWEATHER WOES\n\nSevere weather and humidity were to blame for voting issues in a handful of states.\n\nIn North Carolina, officials said high humidity prevented ballots in some precincts from being able to be fed through tabulators in some precincts in Wake and Forsyth counties. Officials said such ballots are stored securely in emergency bins and would be tabulated as soon as possible.\n\nIn New York City, a co-chairman of the state election board, Douglas Kellner, said scanners were breaking down at a higher-than-usual rate because it was using a two-page ballot and the weather was damp.\n\nIn Tennessee, severe storms that knocked down trees and power lines forced voters in some places to use paper ballots instead of electronic voting machines. Tennessee Coordinator of Elections Mark Goins said the polling places that had electricity knocked out were operating on generators and had emergency ballots ready. He said the paper ballots would be counted Tuesday.\n\n___\n\nVOTERS MISDIRECTED\n\nElection watchers say some voters are reporting being directed to wrong polling places by third-party election help websites such as TurboVote.\n\nSophia Hall, an attorney who was working at an election protection command center in Boston on Tuesday, says they received several such reports in Massachusetts and are aware of reports in other states.\n\nHall says they\u2019ve also received reports of people being told they aren\u2019t registered when they arrive at the polls even though they thought their registration had been confirmed by a third-party site.\n\nTurboVote is a tool created by Democracy Works that helps people register and sends voters email and text reminders about registration deadlines, upcoming elections and where to vote. TurboVote doesn\u2019t actually register voters but facilitates registration with state election offices.\n\nBrandon Naylor, a spokesman for Democracy Works, says TurboVote gets its polling location information directly from the states, but sometimes the locations change at the last minute. He also says people sometimes mistakenly believe they are registered but didn\u2019t complete all the steps to complete their registration with the state.\n\n___\n\nFORECLOSURE ON POLLING PLACE\n\nA polling station in Arizona failed to open on Tuesday for an unusual reason: The building it was in was foreclosed on overnight.\n\nCounty Recorder Adrian Fontes said poll workers were trying to set up in the parking lot of the Golf Academy of America, which had been foreclosed on overnight Tuesday.\n\nThe owners of the Chandler property locked the doors, taking election officials by surprise. Fontes had said reopening the site would have required a court order.\n\nThe polling station was relocated and reopened four hours late.\n\n___\n\nMACHINES MALFUNCTIONING\n\nForty-one states were using computerized voting machines that are more than a decade old. Forty-three states were using machines that are no longer manufactured, making them more difficult to service when they break down, according to New York University\u2019s Brennan Center for Justice. Yet Congress has repeatedly balked at appropriating the more than $1 billion needed to upgrade to more reliable systems.\n\nBy Tuesday afternoon, the nonpartisan Election Protection hotline had received about 17,500 calls from voters experiencing problems at their polling places. Kristen Clarke, president of the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, which helps run the hotline, said that was on par with the number of calls received during a presidential election and noted the hotline had received about 10,400 calls by the same time in 2014.\n\nClarke ran through a list of voting problems, which largely were connected to malfunctioning voting machines reported in Florida, Georgia, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and Virginia.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, in this cycle we have seen sign evidence that we have important work to do to ensure that jurisdictions across the country are using the best voting equipment that is available and machines that don\u2019t malfunction,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cWe should not tolerate this kind of outcome in 2018.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMEDIA KEPT AWAY\n\nMedia outlets were barred from taking photos or video Tuesday at a polling place in Kansas that has been at the center of controversy for weeks, and an embattled Republican congressman banned Iowa\u2019s largest newspaper from covering his election night events.\n\nIn the only polling place in Dodge City, Kansas, which is outside city limits and more than a mile (1.6 kilometers) from the nearest bus stop, reporters were allowed into the Expo Center polling place with notebooks only, the Topeka Capital-Journal reported. Ford County Clerk Debbie Cox said letting the media take pictures and video would be too disruptive.\n\nAttorney Bradley Schlozman, representing Cox, said Kansas law allows the election board to control procedures at polling sites.\n\nMax Kautsch, an attorney for the Capital-Journal and the Kansas Press Association, said that law needs to be balanced with rights under the First Amendment. He noted Ford County has allowed photographs in previous elections.\n\nIn Iowa, Republican Rep. Steve King decided to ban the Des Moines Register from his election night events in Sioux City.\n\nThe Register reported it requested credentials to cover the event but King\u2019s son, Jeff King, responded Tuesday with an email saying, \u201cWe are not granting credentials to the Des Moines Register or any other leftist propaganda media outlet with no concern for reporting the truth.\u201d\n\nKing has faced criticism from Republican officials and lost funding from business groups after he tweeted support for a white nationalist candidate in Toronto and praised a nationalist party in Austria with Nazi ties. King said media reports have been inaccurate and unfair.\n\n___\n\nMISINFORMATION\n\nA sign discouraging college students from voting was spotted at polling place in Rexburg, Idaho, on Tuesday morning.\n\nKristine Anderson, of Rexburg, spotted the sign, which told students they \u201cshould not be registering and voting in your college locale simply because you failed to register and vote at your true domicile.\u201d\n\nAnderson reported the sign to American Civil Liberties Union-Idaho, which tweeted: \u201cWe\u2019ve spoken with the Madison County Clerk and they\u2019re headed to the precinct to investigate these signs.\u201d Anderson said the area is home to a large contingent of college students at Brigham Young University-Idaho.\n\nCollege students have dual residency and a choice of where they want to vote.

Elizabeth Warren, among her party\u2019s harshest critics of President Donald Trump, won re-election Tuesday in Massachusetts and wasted little time ripping into her nemesis.\n\nWarren defeated Republican state Rep. Geoff Diehl, the Massachusetts co-chair of Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign, and independent candidate Shiva Ayaddurai.\n\nIn her victory speech, Warren said Trump practices \u201cthe dark art of ruling by fear \u2014 fear whipped up to turn hard-working Americans against other hard-working Americans.\u201d\n\nWarren was also quick to credit women with leading the resistance to Trump.\n\n\u201cTwo years ago, on a very dark election night, millions of women watched in horror as Donald Trump was elected president,\u201d Warren said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t like it. But they didn\u2019t whimper. They didn\u2019t whine. They fought back.\u201d\n\nWarren has generated considerable speculation about a possible run for the White House in 2020, recently saying she\u2019d take a \u201chard look\u201d at a presidential bid after the Senate race was over.\n\nWith her win, supporters and critics alike will begin looking more closely for any signs from Warren about whether she intends to launch a campaign for president.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren defeated two challengers on Tuesday, winning another term in the U.S. Senate. (Nov. 7)\n\nShe gave no specifics about a future run Tuesday but returned to familiar themes during her speech, saying she and others came to the fight against Trump \u201con behalf of millions of Americans who are getting ripped off in a rigged economy and ignored by a corrupt government in Washington.\u201d\n\nThe former Harvard Law School professor recently released a DNA test suggesting that a distant ancestor was Native American, an effort to rebut Trump\u2019s frequent mockery of her claim to Native American heritage.\n\nDiehl conceded just after 9 p.m.\n\n\u201cWe fought hard for the last 18 months. We left no stone unturned,\u201d Diehl said, talking to supporters gathered in his hometown of Whitman. \u201cI know that I gave it my all.\u201d\n\nTuesday morning Warren downplayed her clashes with Trump after voting near her home in Cambridge.\n\n\u201cFor me this is about the people of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,\u201d Warren told reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s about whether or not we\u2019re able to protect health care, whether or not our students get a break or get crushed by student loan debt.\u201d\n\nThe contest between the two was testy at times, with each candidate looking to score points with voters by chipping away at the other.\n\nWarren said that Diehl would be a rubber stamp in Washington for Trump\u2019s agenda even when it\u2019s not in the interest of most Massachusetts residents.\n\nDiehl argued Warren spent too much time traveling around the country to stump \u2014 and raise money \u2014 for fellow Democrats running for Congress. He said she should quit and run full time for the White House.\n\nFor fans of Warren, the campaign played out in part as a test run for a possible 2020 clash between Warren and Trump.\n\nTrump taunts of \u201cPocahontas\u201d directed at Warren in part prompted her decision to release the DNA test. Warren has said the decision to release the test results was also part of a wider effort on her part to be an open book.\n\n\u201cI put it all out there. Ten years of tax returns. All my employment records, And yeah, I even took a DNA test. It\u2019s there. It\u2019s on the internet. Anybody can take a look at it,\u201d she told The Associated Press in a recent interview.\n\nAlthough she points to some legislative successes under the Trump administration, Warren said her decision to campaign for Democrats in other states is part of a wider goal to help flip the Senate to make it easier for Democrats to push a more ambitious agenda in line with what she said are the goals of most Massachusetts voters.\n\nEven though she was running against Diehl, the figure of Trump, who remains unpopular in Massachusetts where he garnered less than 34 percent of the 2016 vote, hung over the contest.\n\nAsked about the worst thing Trump has done during his two years in office, Warren pointed to what she described as his embrace of authoritarian figures like Russian President Vladimir Putin or North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "PROVIDENCE, R.I.

Men went for the Democratic candidate 57 percent of the time and with the Republican candidate 40 percent of the time.\n\nThree-quarters of New York voters said which party will hold control was very important as they considered their vote. Around 1 in 6 said it was somewhat important.\n\nThree-quarters said they disapproved of the job Congress was doing.

By the end of Saturday\u2019s 55-31 loss , the Gophers had allowed 646 yards of offense, including 430 rushing yards, and five touchdowns that covered at least 30 yards.

Chris Murphy won a second term in office on Tuesday, defeating a little-known Republican small businessman after spending much of the campaign on the stump for fellow Democrats.\n\nWith a $14.5 campaign fund, Murphy had an enormous advantage over his opponent Matt Corey, who runs a high-rise window cleaning business in Hartford. Murphy transferred over $300,000 to the state Democratic Party to help with field organizing.\n\nIt was a marked difference from Murphy\u2019s 2012 race, when he was up against former professional wrestling executive Linda McMahon and the $50 million from her personal fortune that she spent on the race. In 2012, there was a bevy of TV ads slamming both McMahon and Murphy. This time, Murphy ignored his opponent in his ads, focusing instead on his efforts to improve mental health care and to help working people.\n\nMurphy focused on criticizing Republican President Donald Trump\u2019s administration throughout much of the campaign, appearing at events with fellow candidates and touting the importance of electing Democrats across Connecticut.\n\n\u201cWe are not a nation that tolerates bullies or wannabe tyrants,\u201d Murphy said in his victory speech Tuesday. \u201cWe are a democracy and maybe louder and clearer than anything we are saying in Connecticut tonight, we\u2019re saying here in Connecticut that if you come after our democracy than we are coming for you.\u201d\n\nAt a campaign stop at a senior center in West Hartford, Murphy joined Democratic gubernatorial candidate Ned Lamont in painting Lamont\u2019s GOP rival, businessman Bob Stefanowski, as a Trump acolyte who would institute tax cuts that benefit the wealthy and ultimately harm seniors.

(AP) \u2014 CC Sabathia says 2019 will be his final season in the major leagues.\n\n\u201cThis will be it,\u201d the 38-year-old left-hander said in a video posted on Twitter on Wednesday after the New York Yankees finalized his $8 million, one-year contract.\n\nSabathia and New York had reached the agreement Tuesday, subject to a successful physical.\n\nA six-time All-Star and the 2007 AL Cy Young Award winner, Sabathia went 9-7 with a 3.65 ERA in 29 starts this year. He had surgery on his right knee after the 2010 season, in July 2014, after the 2016 season and again last month. Sabathia pitches with a brace on the knee and needs periodic injections there during the season.\n\nHe is 246-153 in 18 major league seasons with a 3.70 ERA and 2,986 strikeouts, including 129-80 in a decade with the Yankees. His new deal boosts his pay from New York to $229 million.\n\nSabathia signed a $161 million, seven-year contract with the Yankees before the 2009 season and led New York to its first World Series title since 2000, then used the leverage of an opt-out provision after the 2011 season to get a new deal that added a $25 million salary for 2016 with a $25 million team option for 2017.\n\nSabathia took a cut to $10 million this year. He missed a $500,000 performance bonus by two innings when he was ejected in his last regular-season start for hitting Tampa Bay\u2019s Jesus Sucre after Rays pitcher Andrew Kittredge threw up-and-in to Austin Romine. Sabathia was suspended the first five games of 2019 but has appealed.\n\n\u201cAt this stage of the game, we should know sooner or later whether we\u2019ll be able to agree on something or not,\u201d Yankees general manager Brian Cashman had said earlier Tuesday.\n\n\u201cLast year we had to be really careful about every step we took in terms of financial commitments so it took longer because we were having to have that luxury-tax issue in the back of our minds.\u201d\n\nNew York dropped below the luxury-tax threshold for the first time in 2018. The Yankees\u2019 projected rotation for 2019 also includes right-handers Luis Severino and Masahiro Tanaka, and Cashman says he intends to add several pitchers after the team went 100-62 only to finish second in the AL East and lose in the Division Series to Boston, the eventual World Series champion.\n\nCashman said Luke Voit will head to spring training as the starter at first base, and it will be up to Greg Bird to earn the job back. Bird had ankle surgery in late March, returned in mid-May and hit .199 with 11 homers and 38 RBIs. Voit, acquired from St. Louis on July 28, hit .333 with 14 homers and 33 RBIs in 39 games.\n\n\u201cHe finished batting in the middle of our lineup in the postseason, so I don\u2019t see why three weeks since that time would change our evaluation process,\u201d Cashman said.\n\n\u201cSomebody\u2019s earned that right and somebody because of injuries has been derailed for a period of time, but I do think that Birdy will benefit from time off and he will have a chance to resuscitate and prove himself.\u201d\n\nBoth can be optioned to the minors next year.\n\nCashman repeated he intends to trade pitcher Sonny Gray, just 15-16 since New York acquired him from Oakland in July 2017. A right-hander who turns 29 this week, Gray bristled at the rough reception by Yankees fans.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a year-and-a-half, I\u2019m not going to be Sisyphus pushing the rock up a hill and having it roll back on top of me,\u201d Cashman said. \u201cIt\u2019s not working. I\u2019m not going to be willing to continue to walk through the fire and expect it to be a different result. So I will reallocate his abilities to some other club for a yet-to-be determined price tag, and he will be good again. Trust me. I think he\u2019s a heck of a pitcher. He\u2019s a very successful major leaguer, and it\u2019s just going to happen somewhere else.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "", "", "", "", "Ayanna Pressley wins election unopposed, completing quest to become Massachusetts\u2019 first black woman in Congress", "", "", "CHICAGO (AP) \u2014 Democrats won the governor\u2019s race and seized a GOP House seat in the red state of Kansas Tuesday night, where more than half of voters \u2014 52 percent\u2014 said the country is headed in the wrong direction, according to a wide-ranging survey of the American electorate.\n\nPresident Donald Trump was a factor for half the state\u2019s voters \u2014 with 29 percent saying they cast ballots to express opposition to him, AP VoteCast found.\n\nKansas voters elected Democratic state Sen.

Jeff Flake. The battle pit Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema against Republican Rep. Martha McSally and drew more than $90 million in spending.\n\nHere\u2019s a snapshot of who voted and why in Arizona, based on preliminary results from AP VoteCast, an innovative nationwide survey of about 138,000 voters and nonvoters \u2014 including 4,128 voters and 443 nonvoters in the state of Arizona \u2014 conducted for The Associated Press by NORC at the University of Chicago.\n\n___\n\nTOP ISSUE: IMMIGRATION\n\nImmigration was at the forefront of voters\u2019 minds: About one-third named it as the most important issue facing the nation in this year\u2019s midterm elections. About one-quarter of voters considered health care paramount, with fewer identifying the economy, the environment or gun policy as the top issue.\n\nLifelong Republican Kay Matthews, a 72-year-old substitute teacher who dropped her early ballot off at a Phoenix library, said the economy is important to her, but immigration is an equal concern. She\u2019s troubled by any influx of immigrants entering the country illegally, she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been taught as a young child that you respect the law. You don\u2019t have to always agree with it, but you do respect it,\u201d Matthews said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t like it, then you work for a change.\u201d\n\nKeith Cook, 53 and an information technology worker at a hospital, has been a Democrat since switching from the GOP since the administration of President George H.W. Bush. Back then, he felt the Republicans were too aligned with the Christian right.\n\nA Christian himself, he said the issues that weigh on him are climate change and homelessness.\n\n\u201cIf you see a neighbor that needs something, you help them out. We\u2019re not doing that anymore. People are saying they\u2019re Christians but what they\u2019re saying is not Christian,\u201d Cook said. \u201cThe whole mess with \u2018Let\u2019s get all the immigrants out,\u2019 that\u2019s silly. Christ said nothing about that.\u201d\n\n___\n\nSTATE OF THE ECONOMY\n\nArizona voters have a positive view of the nation\u2019s current economic outlook, with about two-thirds saying the nation\u2019s economy is good.\n\nArizona\u2019s unemployment rate is 4.7 percent, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, while the national rate remains at a five-decade low of 3.7 percent.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP FACTOR\n\nFor one-third of Arizona voters, President Donald Trump was not a factor they considered while casting their votes. By comparison, 3 in 10 said a reason for their vote was to express support for Trump, and roughly one-third said they voted to express opposition to Trump.\n\nVoters in Arizona had mixed views of Trump: 50 percent said they approve of how he is handling his job as president, while 50 percent said they disapprove of Trump.\n\n\u201cThis particular election, I\u2019m very frightened the direction the country is going in under Trump and his Republican supporters, which includes relatives of mine,\u201d said Kory Ambrosich, a 52-year-old math teacher at a Phoenix community college. \u201cI think that direction definitely needs to be halted and changed,\u201d she said.\n\nAmbrosich, a Democrat, said she cares about human safety. To her, that means everything from providing universal health care to caring for immigrants and eliminating hate speech.\n\nKeith Broadwater, 65, a commercial builder from north Phoenix, said his votes reflected his support for the president. Broadwater, who voted for McSally and GOP Gov. Doug Ducey, described himself as a \u201cChristian American constitutional conservative Republican \u2014 in that order.\u201d\n\nHe credited Trump with improving the business climate.\n\n\u201cThe government is being managed by people that want less government to cut the regulations down on businesses and all the different industries so that the entrepreneurial free expression of ideas can run again,\u201d Broadwater said.\n\n___\n\nRACE FOR SENATE\n\nIn the race for Senate, Republican Martha McSally appeared to lead Democrat Kyrsten Sinema among white voters. Whites with a college education were divided in their support, and whites without a college degree were more likely to support McSally.\n\nSinema led among black voters and also was preferred among Hispanic voters.\n\nVoters under 45 were more likely to favor Sinema; those ages 45 and older appeared to prefer McSally.\n\n___\n\nRACE FOR GOVERNOR\n\nRepublican Gov. Doug Ducey took about two-thirds of the white vote on route to his re-election victory against Democrat David Garcia. Garcia had an advantage among black voters and Hispanic voters, and split among those under 45. Voters ages 45 and older favored Ducey.\n\nWhite voters without a college degree supported Ducey. White college graduates also appeared to favor him. Ducey split the urban vote and handily won in the suburbs, rural areas and small towns.\n\n___\n\nCONTROL OF CONGRESS\n\nTuesday\u2019s elections determined control of Congress in the final two years of Trump\u2019s first term in office, and about two-thirds of Arizona voters said which party will hold control was very important as they considered their vote. Another 1 in 5 said it was somewhat important.\n\n___\n\nSTAYING AT HOME\n\nIn Arizona, three-quarters of registered voters who chose not to vote in the midterm election were younger than 45. A wide share of those who did not vote \u2014 85 percent \u2014 did not have a college degree.

Erik Paulsen in a suburban Minnesota district that figures heavily into Democrats\u2019 hopes for a House takeover.\n\nPaulsen had easily won elections throughout his five terms in office even as the Minneapolis-area district trended toward Democrats.\n\nBut the district favored Hillary Clinton by nearly 10 points two years ago, and a statewide poll late in the race showed Phillips with a comfortable lead. Outside groups poured more than $10 million into the battleground race.\n\nPhillips ran his family\u2019s liquor company and started a chain of local coffee shops. He painted Paulsen as too in-step with President Donald Trump, though Paulsen tried to distance himself from the president.\n\n___\n\n10:05 p.m.\n\nNewly minted Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb of Pennsylvania has defeated three-term Republican Rep.

Tim Murphy, who resigned, in a district that Trump won by about 20 points.\n\nBoth men live in the new 17th District, despite living in different districts that they currently represent.\n\n___\n\n10 p.m.\n\nDemocrat Debbie Mucarsel-Powell has defeated Republican Rep. Carlos Curbelo in Florida, the second GOP incumbent House member to fall. Curbelo, a moderate and critic of President Donald Trump, was trying to defy the political winds against Trump in the South Florida district.\n\nMucarsel-Powell is an immigrant from Ecuador who has worked for several nonprofit organizations in Miami-Dade County. She ran on preventing gun violence and protecting the environment, but her main focus was on health care and the Affordable Care Act, which Curbelo voted to repeal.\n\nMucarsel-Powell painted Curbelo as a politician who talks like a moderate but tends to vote with conservatives.\n\nCurbelo is a leader of the bipartisan Climate Caucus and bucked GOP leadership this summer by supporting a tax on emissions of carbon dioxide, a contributor to global warming.\n\n___\n\n9:00 p.m.\n\nRepublican Rep. Andy Barr of Kentucky won a close-fought race that Democrats had targeted in a bid to shift the House to Democratic control.\n\nBarr turned back a strong challenge from Democrat Amy McGrath in a district that supported President Donald Trump two years ago.\n\nMcGrath, a retired fighter pilot, gave Barr his toughest test yet as he sought a fourth term. Barr urged voters to re-elect him for his \u201caccess and influence with this administration,\u201d while McGrath countered with a message of \u201ccountry over party.\u201d\n\nBarr won by 22 points in 2016, but McGrath waged an aggressive challenge, including TV ads showing her in front of fighter jets and with her young children.\n\nThe district includes Lexington and capital Frankfort. The seat has switched parties five times since 1978.\n\n___\n\n8:50 p.m.\n\nIn Indiana, Greg Pence, an older brother of Vice President Mike Pence, has won a heavily Republican House seat that his famous sibling once held.\n\nThe 61-year-old Pence, an owner of two antique malls, defeated Democrat Jeannine Lee Lake, who publishes a bi-monthly Muncie newspaper.\n\nThe eastern Indiana seat is open because Republican Rep. Luke Messer ran in the GOP primary for the Senate. Greg Pence is one of Mike Pence\u2019s three brothers.\n\nGreg Pence is a Marine veteran and once ran a now-bankrupt chain of convenience stores.\n\n___\n\n8:30 p.m.\n\nRepublican Rep. Barbara Comstock of Virginia was the first congressional incumbent to lose as voters in her Northern Virginia district expressed their continued dislike of President Donald Trump.\n\nDemocratic state Sen. Jennifer Wexton won an easy victory in the wealthy suburban district outside Washington, which Hillary Clinton won by 10 percentage points.\n\nComstock tried hard to emphasize her independence from Trump, but Wexton, a former prosecutor, portrayed the two-term incumbent as a Trump ally out of touch with the diverse, well-educated district.\n\nComstock easily beat a Democrat in 2016 when her district went for Clinton.\n\nThe national focus on the race helped Comstock and Wexton raise more than $5 million in all, while outside groups spent more than $10 million.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "This photo provided by Jessica Crane shows Susan B.

He said he doesn\u2019t think any candidate has a good solution for overhauling the way Americans get health insurance.\n\n\u201cI wish someone would say what\u2019s causing the high costs,\u201d said Stewart, a Republican. \u201cMy big fear is that with Obamacare having failed so badly that everyone is going to run to a single-payer system.\u201d\n\nSix in 10 Missouri voters said they wanted to see the Affordable Care Act, the 2010 law that overhauled the nation\u2019s health insurance system, partly or entirely repealed.\n\nHealth care was a major theme in Missouri campaign ads. Hawley is among 20 Republican attorney generals who have asked the courts to rule the health care law as unconstitutional.\n\nOther voters cited immigration, the economy, terrorism and the environment as the top issue.\n\n___\n\nSTATE OF THE ECONOMY\n\nA majority of Missouri voters had a favorable view of the nation\u2019s economy.\n\nThis summer, Missouri hit its lowest unemployment rate since 2000 but Democrats emphasized the negative effect President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs had on some agricultural prices and manufacturing industries.\n\nRichard Rice\u2019s wife, Linda Rice, 68, of Jefferson City, praised Trump for economy and said she planned to support Republicans in the election.\n\n\u201cI think he has our best interests at heart,\u201d Linda Rice said of the president.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP FACTOR\n\nSix in 10 Missouri voters said Trump influenced their vote, with half saying they voted to support Trump and the other half to oppose him.\n\nMonica Miller, a 53-year-old public school teacher, said racial tensions and the political climate have gotten worse since Trump took office.\n\n\u201cYou hope that this is somebody who will rise to the occasion, but your worst fears are realized,\u201d Miller said, adding, \u201cname-calling seems to be the norm.\u201d\n\nHowever, 53 percent of the state\u2019s voters said they like how Trump is performing.\n\nThe president visited Missouri twice in the week before Election Day as he stumped for Hawley.\n\n___\n\nCONTROL OF CONGRESS\n\nTuesday\u2019s election will determine control of Congress in the final two years of Trump\u2019s term, and nearly 7 in 10 Missouri voters said which party will hold control was very important as they considered their vote.\n\nMatthew J. Smith, a 23-year-old Republican studying at Missouri State University in Springfield, said the idea of Democrats controlling the House worried him.\n\n\u201cIf Democrats take over the House, we could see a potential impeachment of the president, for no reason at all,\u201d Smith said.\n\nMeanwhile, Deborah Zemke, a 64-year-old children\u2019s book author and illustrator from Columbia, said the Republican-led Congress is not doing enough to counter Trump, whose rhetoric she does not like.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s essential that we exercise some checks and balances on the current administration,\u201d Zemke said.\n\n___\n\nSTAYING AT HOME\n\nIn Missouri, a majority of voters who did not cast a ballot in the midterm were younger than 45, with a wide share \u2014 83 percent \u2014being those who do not have a college degree.\n\n___\n\nAP VoteCast is a survey of the American electorate in all 50 states conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago for The Associated Press and Fox News.

A spokesman with the registrar's office says the line at its headquarters in Norwalk is wrapping around the building and that wait times were at about two hours Tuesday. (AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill)\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 People who missed the registration deadline and wanted to vote in Tuesday\u2019s election faced long lines throughout California, including one hundreds deep outside the main elections office in Los Angeles County.\n\nBut glitches were few in a state that has tried to make voting more convenient, allowing Election Day registration but only at main elections office in most counties. California has more than 19.6 million registered voters.\n\nBrenda Duran, spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County Registrar, estimated the line outside its headquarters in Norwalk had up to 400 people with about two hours until polls closed at 8 p.m.\n\nOrange and Sacramento counties were also among those reporting long lines.\n\n\u201cNinety percent are registering for the very first time,\u201d said Neal Kelley, Orange County registrar. \u201cI would say for the most part people are civil and talking in line and they seem to be happy and enjoying themselves.\u201d\n\nKim Nalder, a political science professor at California State University, Sacramento, said she was \u201csurprised and elated\u201d to see a long line at a campus polling spot that snaked down the hall, out the door, and around several more corners.\n\nIt was full of young people waiting to vote, she said, adding that there was no line in the June primary. She expected a few more people Tuesday because it was a general election.\n\n\u201cBut this just blew it out of the water,\u201d Nalder said. \u201cI have never seen anything like it on our campus.\u201d\n\nCalifornia Common Cause, a nonpartisan good-government group, reported an unusually high number of calls from people experiencing problems voting, which could indicate higher turnout and confusion over changes in polling places, said spokeswoman Kati Phillips.\n\nShe said most of the roughly 2,000 calls were about polling places or questions about registration. A handful of people called to say they were asked for identification or about their country of origin, both illegal questions.\n\nA registered Republican called to report that his name was not on a voter roll as it should have been, and a Latino man called to say the poll worker listed his name separately on a yellow pad and the voter wanted to know if that was legal.\n\n\u201cSo people are being sensitive,\u201d she said, \u201cand in the climate we have today, that makes a lot of sense.\u201d\n\nThe registration tally translates into about 78 percent of eligible voters, the highest percentage of registered voters in a midterm election since 1950. The number is likely buoyed by a new automatic voter registration program that registers eligible people who visit the Department of Motor Vehicles, unless they opt out.\n\nSeveral county elections officers reported higher-than-usual activity. San Francisco Elections Director John Arntz said turnout might exceed the 61 percent reached in 2010. Voters were weighing a local measure, Proposition C, which would raise taxes on wealthy companies for homeless services.\n\n\u201cI believe it will be one of the highest voter turnouts for a statewide general election for a midterm that\u2019s been recorded,\u201d said Jim Irizarry, assistant chief elections officer in San Mateo County. \u201cIs it the highest, I can\u2019t tell you. I can see the numbers are pretty significant.\u201d\n\nSan Mateo County in Silicon Valley is one of five counties that have vote centers, which replaces neighborhood polling places with fewer \u201cone-stop vote centers.\u201d People can vote in-person, pick up replacement ballots and register to vote at the centers.\n\nBut Paul Mitchell, vice president of non-partisan research firm Political Data, Inc., said Tuesday that statewide turnout might hit 60 percent, which is on the high end for midterms but not extraordinary.\n\nMitchell said some counties, such as Orange, have exciting congressional races and turnout might near presidential levels, but others were casting votes for a more routine slate of statewide office and 11 propositions.\n\n\u201cWhat I think we\u2019re seeing is essentially two Californias,\u201d he said.\n\nDemocrats hold a 3.7 million edge in voter registrations, and Republicans are also outnumbered by independents. They tend to vote like Democrats in California.\n\nIn Merced County, Democrats scrambled after an early morning break-in at a campaign office where computers and literature were stolen, affecting the campaign for state Senate candidate Anna Caballero.\n\n---\n\nThis version corrects the spelling of Anna Caballero.", "Click to copy\n\nClick to copy https://apnews.com/49f39ecefaa04c2985a18d71ac7a37ed", "Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, right, speaks with former NFL player Jason Witten before the first half of an NFL football game between the Dallas Cowboys and the Tennessee Titans, Monday, Nov. 5, 2018, in Arlington, Texas. (AP Photo/Ron Jenkins)\n\nFRISCO, Texas (AP) \u2014 Even if the Dallas Cowboys were better than 3-5, Jerry Jones says he would have plenty of cause for concern based on what he saw in a damaging loss to Tennessee.\n\nAnd the normally upbeat owner and general manager doesn\u2019t care to discuss the NFC East standings, even though the Cowboys can pull even with defending Super Bowl champion Philadelphia by getting their first road win of the season at the Eagles on Sunday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not in anything if we don\u2019t play better,\u201d Jones said after a 28-14 loss to the Titans that looked like it could be a blowout win for Dallas midway through the first quarter. \u201cWhat I recognize is not so much the three wins and five losses but the way we lost this game and the way we played in the game.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to play better. Our record could be better than it is right now, and we\u2019d still be in trouble.\u201d\n\nThe Cowboys traded for a new No. 1 receiver in Amari Cooper and fired offensive line coach Paul Alexander during a surprisingly busy open week. The changes looked good early, with Cooper scoring the first Dallas touchdown and star running back Ezekiel Elliott having 75 yards from scrimmage in the first quarter.\n\nEverything changed with Dak Prescott\u2019s throw to Cooper in double coverage in the end zone with a 7-0 lead. Kevin Byard intercepted, Tennessee drove 80 yards in 15 plays for the tie and the Titans never trailed again.\n\nNow the Cowboys are looking at a second straight year of missing the playoffs since the remarkable rookie seasons for Prescott and Elliott, who powered Dallas to an NFC-best 13 wins before a divisional round loss to Green Bay.\n\nSince a franchise-record 11-game winning streak for an 11-1 record two years ago, the Cowboys are 14-15, including the loss to the Packers.\n\nJones was peppered with questions about Garrett\u2019s job security after the loss to the Titans, at one point flatly saying he wouldn\u2019t fire him during the season. Anything less than a 6-2 finish would leave Garrett with three winning seasons, and two playoff appearances, in eight full seasons.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how to articulate my patience or lack thereof, and I\u2019m not trying to be smart,\u201d Jones said. \u201cI just don\u2019t have an assessment of my patience right now.\u201d\n\nPrescott committed his first two turnovers at home this season in Dallas\u2019 first loss at AT&T Stadium. The interception was the game-changer. A fumble while trying to churn for yardage on a sack at his 40-yard line set up Tennessee\u2019s go-ahead touchdown in the third quarter.\n\nWhile it\u2019s realistic to expect Prescott and Cooper to need time to work together and an offensive line to adjust to an in-season coaching change, the Cowboys are running out of it.\n\n\u201cAs coach Garrett said, we\u2019ve got a decision to make,\u201d said Prescott, who threw for 243 yards and two touchdowns. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to buckle down, lock arms and be together more than ever. Not let anything break us apart.\u201d\n\nGarrett revealed a possible crack Tuesday. A few weeks after strongly backing Scott Linehan when asked if he still had faith in his offensive coordinator, Garrett had a different tone when asked if he envisioned a scenario where he took over play-calling.\n\n\u201cRight now, Scott Linehan is going to call the plays on offense,\u201d Garrett, who called plays early in his tenure as head coach, said after the Cowboys had just 109 yards total offense in a scoreless second half against the Titans.\n\nIf the Cowboys lose to the Eagles, not much else will matter, other than the question of Garrett\u2019s future beyond this season. Jones declined several chances to address that issue.\n\n\u201cI think we realize we have eight games to go, we\u2019ve got a long way to go in this season,\u201d Jones said. \u201cWe want to play better than we played tonight, so I certainly think each individual and coach and front office person is going to have to do better, including me.\u201d\n\nNOTES: Garrett said rookie LG Connor Williams came out of the Titans game with a knee injury that could require arthroscopic surgery. Any possible line shuffling would appear to be confined to Williams\u2019 spot and center, where Joe Looney has filled in all season with four-time Pro Bowler Travis Frederick battling a nerve disorder. The likely candidate to join the group is backup center Adam Redmond, who has done some work in practice at guard in practice. ... Garrett indicated LB Sean Lee will have another extended absence after re-injuring a hamstring. Lee missed three games earlier this year with the same injury.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "Republican US Rep.

(Stephen M. Dowell/Orlando Sentinel via AP)\n\nMIAMI (AP) \u2014 Republican Ron DeSantis beat Democrat Andrew Gillum in the Florida governor\u2019s race with strong support from voters who ranked immigration, the economy or jobs as their No. 1 issue, according to a wide-ranging survey of the electorate.\n\nAP VoteCast found that 8 in 10 voters who were most concerned about immigration voted for DeSantis. He won 6 of 10 votes from those placing the economy and jobs their top issue.\n\nVoters cast ballots for governor, U.S. Senate and members of Congress on Tuesday. Here\u2019s a snapshot of who voted and why in Florida, based on preliminary results from AP VoteCast. The innovative nationwide survey of about 139,000 voters and nonvoters \u2014 including 3,744 voters and 679 nonvoters in the battleground state of Florida \u2014 was conducted for The Associated Press by NORC at the University of Chicago.\n\n___\n\nRACE FOR GOVERNOR\n\nRon DeSantis, a former congressman, put his thanks squarely where it was due after winning: with President Donald Trump. He said Trump\u2019s support made all the difference in his defeat of Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, who was hoping to become Florida\u2019s first black governor and the first Democrat elected governor since 1994.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to thank our president for standing by me, for standing by me when it wasn\u2019t necessarily the smart thing,\u201d DeSantis said. \u201cMr. President, I look forward to working with you to advance Florida\u2019s priorities.\u201d\n\nTrump, who carried Florida in his presidential win, tweeted his congratulations early Wednesday: \u201cRon DeSantis showed great courage in his hard fought campaign to become the Governor of Florida. Congratulations to Ron and family!\u201d\n\nRepublicans have now won the governor\u2019s office six consecutive times. The Capitol will enter its third decade under complete Republican rule when DeSantis takes office in January.\n\nGillum trailed by about 1 percentage point and fewer than 80,000 votes when he conceded. He had built a lot of enthusiasm around his campaign and led in most polls leading up to the final week of the election.\n\nGillum led DeSantis among voters under 45 in the race for governor. Voters ages 45 and older appeared to prefer DeSantis. Black voters and Hispanic voters preferred Gillum. White voters overall preferred DeSantis. Whites without a college degree were more likely to support DeSantis. Similarly, white college graduates appeared to prefer DeSantis.\n\n___\n\nSCOTT DECLARES VICTORY IN SENATE RACE\n\nThe race for the U.S. Senate in Florida between Democratic incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson and Republican Rick Scott remained too close to call Wednesday \u2014 with a margin of less than one half of 1 percent. Under state law in Florida, a recount is mandatory if the winning candidate\u2019s margin is less than 0.5 percentage points. The Associated Press does not call any race that may proceed to a recount.\n\nHours earlier, Scott declared victory over the three-term senator.\n\nA wealthy former hospital executive, Scott entered politics as part of the 2010 tea party movement and poured $60 million of his own money into the Senate race.\n\nNelson was a congressman from 1979 to 1991. From 1995 to 2001, he served in state government before his Senate election in 2000.\n\nNelson did not publicly concede.\n\nScott was preferred over Nelson among white voters. Whites with a college education leaned toward Scott, and whites without a college degree supported Scott as well.\n\nNelson had a sizable advantage among black voters and also had an apparent advantage among Hispanic voters.\n\nVoters under 45 favored Nelson; those ages 45 and older appeared to prefer Scott.\n\n___\n\nTOP ISSUES\n\nVoters considered several issues to be important to their vote in this midterm election, including immigration (near a third), health care (4 in 10), the economy (nearly 2 in 10), gun policy (1 in 10) and the environment (less than 1 in 10).\n\nBoth Scott and Nelson clashed sharply in their Senate race over gun violence, a big issue in Florida following the February mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Nelson favors a ban on military-style assault weapons and implementing a comprehensive system of background checks. Scott signed legislation in Florida that requires anyone wanting to buy a gun to be 21, but the bill didn\u2019t include a ban on assault weapons.\n\n\u201cGun violence prevention is such an important issue to me,\u201d said Adam Alhanti, a student at Stoneman Douglas High when the massacre occurred. \u201cThere are so many things that we need to take charge of, and we can really make a difference, not just in our nation, but right down to our local communities with who represents us in office.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFELONS VOTING\n\nMost Florida felons who have finished their sentences will be able to vote again in future elections. Voters approved Amendment 4, which says most felons will automatically have their voting rights restored when they complete their sentences or go on probation.\n\nThe amendment won support across most demographic groups in Florida. Support for the ballot was especially strong among liberal Democratic voters \u2014 roughly 9 in 10 supported. By contrast, just about half of conservative Republicans voted in favor. Among black voters, about 9 in 10 expressed support for the amendment.\n\n___\n\nCOUNTRY ON THE RIGH TRACK?\n\nNearly half of Florida voters said the country is on the right track, compared with slightly more than half who said the country is headed in the wrong direction.\n\n___\n\nSTATE OF THE ECONOMY\n\nVoters have a positive view of the nation\u2019s current economic outlook \u2014 two-thirds said the nation\u2019s economy is good, compared with a third who said it is not good.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP FACTOR\n\nFor a third of Florida voters, Trump was not a factor they considered while casting votes. By comparison, 3 in 10 said a reason for their vote was to express support for Trump, and slightly more than a third said they voted to express opposition to Trump.\n\nVoters in Florida had mixed views of Trump: half said they approve of how he is handling his job as president, while the other half said they disapprove of Trump.\n\nAnjenys Gonzalez of Miami voted for Democrats Gillum in the governor\u2019s race and Nelson for Senate. She said Trump\u2019s endorsements of their opponents were factors in her decisions. \u201cI think his administration has done the exact opposite of upholding our democracy,\u201d she said. \u201cAnybody he\u2019s endorsing clearly is in line with his policies.\u201d\n\nChaunce O\u2019Connor, an Independent from Westchester, Florida, said Trump\u2019s endorsement of DeSantis for governor had no bearing on his decision to vote for him. \u201cI don\u2019t judge a person by who they\u2019re influenced by,\u201d he said. \u201cI judge them solely by their success and what their past is.\u201d\n\n___\n\nCONTROL OF CONGRESS\n\nTuesday\u2019s elections determined control of Congress in the final two years of Trump\u2019s first term in office, and three-fourths of Florida voters said which party will hold control was very important as they considered their vote. Another 2 in 10 said it was somewhat important.\n\n___\n\nSTAYING AT HOME\n\nIn Florida, two-thirds of registered voters who chose not to vote in the midterm election were younger than 45. A wide share of those who did not vote \u2014 8 in 10 \u2014 did not have a college degree. About as many nonvoters were Democrats (3 in 10) as Republicans (3 in 10).\n\n___\n\nAP VoteCast is a survey of the American electorate in all 50 states conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago for The Associated Press and Fox News.

Solis)\n\nVoters casting midterm election ballots in Mississippi are divided over the state of the nation, according to a wide-ranging survey of the American electorate.\n\nAs voters cast ballots for U.S. Senate and members of Congress in Tuesday\u2019s elections, AP VoteCast found that 52 percent of Mississippi voters said the country is on the right track, compared with 46 percent who said the country is headed in the wrong direction.\n\nHere\u2019s a snapshot of who voted and why in Mississippi, based on preliminary results from AP VoteCast, an innovative nationwide survey of about 138,000 voters and nonvoters \u2014 including 3,031 voters and 833 nonvoters in the state of Mississippi \u2014 conducted for The Associated Press by NORC at the University of Chicago.\n\n___\n\nTWO SENATE SEATS\n\n\u2014 Republican U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker defeated Democratic state Rep. David Baria and two others Tuesday, keeping the seat he has held since 2007.\n\nWicker was preferred over Baria among white voters. Whites with a college education supported Wicker, and whites without a college degree favored Wicker as well. Baria was preferred among black voters. Voters under 45 were divided in their support; those ages 45 and older preferred Wicker.\n\n\u2014Mississippi\u2019s U.S. Senate special election is headed to a runoff, and the state\u2019s voters will either elect a woman to the office for the first time ever or a black man for the first time since Reconstruction. Republican Cindy Hyde-Smith and Democrat Mike Espy advanced from a field of four. They compete in a Nov. 27 runoff, and the winner will serve the final two years of a term started by Republican Sen. Thad Cochran, who retired in April.\n\nRepublican Gov. Phil Bryant appointed Hyde-Smith, who was state agriculture commissioner, to temporarily succeed Cochran until the special election is decided. She is the first woman to represent Mississippi in Congress, but no woman has been elected to the job from the state. She is endorsed by President Donald Trump. Espy is a former congressman and former U.S. agriculture secretary.\n\nVoters under 45 supported Espy; those ages 45 and older modestly supported Hyde-Smith.\n\n___\n\nTOP ISSUES\n\nAsked about their top concerns, roughly one in four voters chose immigration, the economy, or health care.\n\nHealth care was the top issue for Rhonda Davidson, 55, who said needed oxygen treatments and was on disability. She also criticized Trump\u2019s tough talk on immigrants and deployment of troops to the Southern border to meet migrants making their way north from Central America through Mexico. She lamented the idea of sending troops with firearms to meet desperate migrants.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s totally unacceptable,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s not who we are.\u201d\n\nWell over half of voters considered the nation\u2019s economic outlook good, with about four in 10 saying it is not good.\n\nOn the economy, Ricky McCulley, 57, of Diamondhead, said Trump \u201chas done a terrific job on the economy. I have more money in my pocket on payday then I did before he took as president.\u201d\n\nStill, Mary Ann Holmes, 66, a retiree in Jackson with a mortgage paid off, said she was concerned for those struggling to get by on the minimum wage. Mississippi, like some other states, hasn\u2019t increased its minimum wage above the federal floor of $7.25 an hour.\n\n\u201cI would like for those in the Senate and the House and the president to make $7.25 and see if they can maintain\u201d themselves, Holmes said.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP FACTOR\n\nAbout a third of voters in Mississippi, a state carried by Trump in the 2016 election, said Trump was not a factor they considered while casting their vote.\n\nMcCulley was an example. He said he considers himself a conservative rather than a Republican or Democrat. And, although he likes the economy under Trump, he considers the president \u201ckind of wishy-washy on things.\u201d He said he didn\u2019t vote in the last presidential election because he couldn\u2019t vote for Trump.\n\nParamedic Dawn Roderick, 49, of Diamondhead, said Trump was a motivator but not the factor in her vote.\n\n\u201cEvery way, I just feel we need to keep the Democrats out, and the Republicans in. You\u2019re in Trump territory,\u201d Roderick explained.\n\nStill, the VoteCast survey found that about two-thirds of Mississippi voters said Trump was a reason for their vote.\n\n\u201cI think Donald Trump is out of control and unless he has some kind of checks and balances on his behavior, we are in trouble,\u201d said Octavia Clayborne, 66, voting in Jackson.\n\n___\n\nCONTROL OF CONGRESS\n\nTuesday\u2019s elections determined control of Congress in the final two years of Trump\u2019s first term in office, and more than three-quarters of Mississippi\u2019s voters said which party will hold control was very important as they considered their vote. More than 1 in 10 said it was somewhat important.\n\n___\n\nAP VoteCast is a survey of the American electorate in all 50 states conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago for The Associated Press and Fox News.

(AP) \u2014 A majority of New Hampshire voters have negative views on President Donald Trump, but more than half approve of how he is handling the economy, according to a wide-ranging survey of the American electorate.\n\nAP VoteCast found that most voters casting ballots for governor and members of Congress in Tuesday\u2019s elections disapprove of Trump decisively on health care, immigration, international trade and Supreme Court nominations. Fifty-four percent approved of the president on the economy, while 45 percent disapproved.\n\nThe state\u2019s unemployment rate stood at 2.7 percent in September, tied for third lowest in the nation.\n\nSix in 10 New Hampshire voters said the country is on the wrong track, compared with around 4 in 10 who said the country is headed in the right direction.\n\nHere\u2019s a snapshot of who voted and why in New Hampshire, based on preliminary results from AP VoteCast, an innovative nationwide survey of about 139,000 voters and nonvoters \u2014 including 2,753 voters and 525 nonvoters in the state of New Hampshire \u2014 conducted for The Associated Press by NORC at the University of Chicago.\n\n___\n\nRACE FOR GOVERNOR\n\nRepublican Gov. Chris Sununu defeated Democrat Molly Kelly. Only two governors in the past 100 years have run for re-election and lost after a single term.\n\nVoters ages 45 and older leaned toward Sununu. Kelly had an apparent advantage over Sununu among voters under 45. Voters without a college degree favored Sununu, while college graduates were split.\n\nSununu, 44, the son of a former governor and brother of a former U.S. senator, has touted the state\u2019s strong economy and progress on the opioid crisis.\n\nKelly, who served for a decade in the state senate, had highlighted her background as a former single mother who put herself through college. She criticized Sununu for calling paid family medical leave a \u201cvacation.\u201d\n\nMark Winzeler, spent 30 years in advertising and now owns an art and antiques shop in Hopkinton, New Hampshire. He voted for Sununu, saying he didn\u2019t feel comfortable with Kelly.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have anything against her, but Sununu\u2019s not doing a bad job. He\u2019s doing an adequate job at least,\u201d said the 65-year-old.\n\n___\n\nTOP ISSUE: HEALTH CARE\n\nHealth care was at the forefront of voters\u2019 minds: around 1 in 4 named it as the most important issue facing the nation in this year\u2019s midterm elections. About 2 in 10 considered immigration or the economy the top issue, while around 1 in 10 named the environment or gun policy.\n\nBrenda Quinn, 53, a psychotherapist from Hopkinton, New Hampshire, said protecting access to health care and gun control were among her top issues.\n\n\u201cThere are reasonable accommodations that can be made while we still protect the Second Amendment,\u201d she said.\n\nQuinn said she also was motivated by what is happening at the national level. She is an independent who supported John Kasich\u2019s presidential campaign in 2016.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m an independent, but I probably leaned harder toward the Democratic vote than I ever have in my life. I\u2019m just going that way because I need a sense of safety,\u201d she said.\n\n___\n\nSTATE OF THE ECONOMY\n\nVoters have a positive view of the nation\u2019s current economic outlook \u2014 about 7 in 10 said the nation\u2019s economy is good, compared with 3 in 10 who said it\u2019s not good.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP FACTOR\n\nAbout 4 in 10 New Hampshire voters said they voted to express opposition to President Donald Trump. By comparison, 2 in 10 said a reason for their vote was to express support for Trump, while fewer than 4 in 10 said Trump was not a reason for their vote.\n\nSix in 10 voters said they disapprove of how Trump is handling his job as president, while 4 in 10 said they approve of Trump.\n\nSteve Barba, 72, of Concord, New Hampshire, said he\u2019s voted for candidates on both sides of the slate all his life. He chose not to cast a vote for governor this year. He said he likes Sununu, but \u201cI\u2019ve made a pledge to not vote for another Republican so long as Donald Trump is president.\u201d\n\nHe voted for Democratic U.S. Rep. Annie Kuster in New Hampshire\u2019s 2nd Congressional District. Kuster won a fourth term over Republican state Rep. Steve Negron.\n\nMeanwhile, Democrat Chris Pappas defeated Republican Eddie Edwards in the 1st Congressional District, succeeding Democratic Rep. Carol Shea-Porter. Pappas has talked about restoring decency in Washington.\n\n___\n\nSTAYING AT HOME\n\nIn New Hampshire, 67 percent of registered voters who chose not to vote in the midterm election were younger than 45. A wide share of those who did not vote \u2014 around three-quarters \u2014 did not have a college degree.

The sentence would be served consecutive to his current sentence.", "", "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump was a dominant force in the 2018 midterm elections as attitudes toward the polarizing leader influenced the decisions of nearly two-thirds of voters.\n\nThirty-eight percent of voters cast their ballots to express opposition to the president, according to AP VoteCast, a national survey of the electorate, while 26 percent said they voted to express support for Trump.\n\nWhile Trump was not on the ballot, his controversial administration animated voters on both sides of the aisle, with 2018 likely to set turnout records for a midterm election. Democrats have been activated in opposition to Trump since the moment of his election, while in recent weeks Trump has driven Republicans to the polls by trying to cast the race as a referendum on his administration.\n\nThe outcome of Tuesday\u2019s races was mixed: Democratic control of the House stands to alter the course of the Trump presidency, while Republican victories in key Senate and gubernatorial races pointed to the enduring strength of the Trump coalition.\n\nThe snapshot of who voted and why comes from VoteCast, a nationwide survey of more than 116,000 voters and about 22,000 nonvoters conducted for The Associated Press by NORC at the University of Chicago.\n\nAccording to AP VoteCast, nearly half of voters said the Brett Kavanaugh confirmation battle was very important to their vote and they broke for the Democratic candidates. But the individual state results didn't always reflect the national trend. (Nov. 6)\n\nHeading into Election Day, Democrats pinned their hopes of retaking the House, and ultimately the White House, on women and minority voters, particularly in suburban districts. Republicans looked to retain their majorities by preserving support among the bloc of voters who propelled Trump to the White House in 2016.\n\nThere were reasons for both sides to be emboldened by Tuesday\u2019s results.\n\nAccording to VoteCast, women voted considerably more in favor of their congressional Democratic candidate: About 6 in 10 voted for the Democrat, compared with 4 in 10 for the Republican. Men, by contrast, were more evenly divided in their vote.\n\nUrbanites voted almost 2 to 1 in favor of Democrats, and small-town and rural voters cast votes for Republicans by a significant, but smaller margin.\n\nIn suburban areas, where key House races were being decided, voters skewed significantly toward Democrats by an 8-point margin.\n\nNon-white voters cast ballots for Democrats by a roughly 3-to-1 margin.\n\nDemocrats needed to gain a net of at least 23 seats in the House and two seats in the Senate to win majorities in the respective chambers. They secured the first, but it was Republicans who won the night for the statewide seats.\n\nAhead of the election, both parties claimed the emotionally charged debate over the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh would motivate their supporters to turn out. Kavanaugh faced multiple allegations of sexual misconduct from his youth, which he denied.\n\nThe following message will be displayed to users with unsupported browsers: Your browser does not support the iframe HTML tag. Try viewing this in a modern browser like Chrome, Safari, Firefox or Internet Explorer 9 or later.\n\nAccording to VoteCast, half of voters said the tumultuous process was very important to their vote and they broke for the Democratic House candidate. Still, an overwhelming majority of voters in both parties said the Kavanaugh debate was at least somewhat important to their vote.\n\nAnd in North Dakota, where Republicans picked up a seat that helped them hold onto control of the Senate, voters concerned about Kavanaugh broke strongly toward the GOP.\n\nBoth parties\u2019 closing messages appeared to have animated their respective bases, according to VoteCast, with health care and immigration each described as the most important issues in the election by about 25 percent of voters. Of those who listed health care as the most important issue facing the nation, about 3 in 4 voted for the Democratic candidate. About the same percentage of voters who described immigration as the most important issue cast ballots for the Republican.\n\nOpposition to Trump proved to be more a motivating factor for Democrats than support for the president a factor for Republicans. Still, Republican voters tended to be overwhelmingly supportive of the president.\n\nMore voters disapproved of Trump\u2019s job performance than approved \u2014 a finding that is largely consistent with recent polling.\n\nVoters scored Trump positively on the economy and for standing up \u201cfor what he believes in.\u201d But the president received negative marks from voters on temperament and trustworthiness.\n\nStill, about one-third of voters said Trump was not a factor in their votes.\n\nWith the final days of the 2018 campaign interrupted by a spate of politically motivated attempted bombings and a massacre at a synagogue in Pittsburgh, about 2 in 10 Democratic and Republican voters think their own party\u2019s way of talking about politics is leading to an increase in violence.\n\nVoteCast debuted Tuesday, replacing the in-person exit poll as a source of detailed information about the American electorate. Developed with NORC at the University of Chicago, it combines a random sample survey of registered voters and a massive poll conducted via opt-in online panels. The resulting research has the accuracy of random sampling and the depth provided by an online poll that interviews tens of thousands.\n\nVoteCast results cannot be reliably compared to the results of previous exit polls, as the two surveys use different methodologies to poll the electorate. Differences between the two may be the result of differences in survey methods, rather than real changes in opinions or makeup of the electorate over time.\n\n___\n\nAP VoteCast is a survey of the American electorate conducted in all 50 states by NORC at the University of Chicago for The Associated Press and Fox News.

Brooke Paige won the Senate nomination along with the nomination to five other statewide GOP posts, including the Senate. But after the primary, Paige, who said he sought the nominations to ensure the Republicans had candidates on the ballot, turned down all the nominations except that of secretary of state, allowing the party to choose someone for the position.\n\nVermont Sen.

Zupan campaigned against what he felt was big government and social welfare programs. But his candidacy never gained traction and his fall campaign drew little attention.\n\nThere were also seven third-party candidates on the ballot.\n\nRather than focusing on his re-election, Sanders traveled the country to support Democratic candidates and an array of policy issues. An online fundraising powerhouse in 2016, Sanders has maintained a list of millions of his supporters that he can use to help endorsed candidates.\n\nSanders\u2019 was the main alternative to Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic primaries, but the 2020 campaign is expected to be a wide-open contest that could include several senators such as Elizabeth Warren, of Massachusetts, Cory Booker, of New Jersey and Kamala Harris, of California, plus former Vice President Joe Biden, other members of Congress, governors and mayors.\n\nSanders has been at the center of a debate over the party\u2019s future and whether his agenda of free college tuition, a $15 hourly minimum wage and a \u201cMedicare for all\u201d health care can win over general-election voters.", "", "DENVER (AP) \u2014 A Denver police officer will serve four days of unpaid suspension for interfering with an investigation by using a police database to share investigative information with a suspect\u2019s girlfriend.\n\nThe Denver Post reports a Department of Public Safety disciplinary letter says Officer Shederick Dobbin used the National Crime Information Center database to look up an investigation into a man the officer knew from his other job working security at a nightclub.\n\nThe man was suspected in a June 11 attack on a city employee.\n\nA message left at a phone number listed for Dobbin was not immediately returned Tuesday.\n\nThe suspect\u2019s girlfriend called Dobbin, whom she knew through the nightclub, after a Denver police detective called her in an attempt to contact the suspect.
