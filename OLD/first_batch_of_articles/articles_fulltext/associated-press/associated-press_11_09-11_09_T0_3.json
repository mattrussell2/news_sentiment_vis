George Lawrence Price, center, at the St. Symphorien Cemetery near Mons, Belgium. Price was the last Canadian soldier to die on the Western Front during the First World War. (AP Photo/Virginia Mayo, File)\n\nSAINT-SYMPHORIEN, Belgium (AP) \u2014 With the clock ticking down to mere seconds in a four-year conflict that had already killed millions, the folly of death and destruction in World War I became ever more incomprehensible. Yet, even then it could not be stopped.\n\nWith both sides in the war already knowing for hours a cease-fire would start at 11 a.m. on the 11th day of the 11th month in 1918, hundreds of good men kept falling that morning.\n\nFear the other side would not abide by the conditions of the armistice, a sheer hatred produced by four years of unprecedented slaughter, blind ambition of commanders who craved that last victory, the inane joy of killing, reason enough not to let humanity shine through a few minutes, hours early. Put together they trumped the lives of soldiers, many of whom were convinced they were on the brink of peace and survival.\n\nWith two minutes to go, Canadian Private George Lawrence Price was shot by a German sniper close to Mons in southern Belgium. Another life shattered in its prime at 25.\n\nSome 250 kilometers (150 miles) away on the Western Front in France, an American soldier Henry Gunther, for reasons still hard to explain a century later, stormed a German post with only one minute left before the armistice and was mowed down by machine gun fire. He was 23.\n\n\u201cGunther\u2019s act is seen as almost a symbol of the futility of the larger war,\u201d said U.S. historian Alec Bennett. \u201cHe was the last American. I believe he may have been the last soldier on any side to die in World War I.\u201d\n\nAny soldier who died that morning might well be an equal symbol of futility, and the mark of \u201cNov. 11, 1918\u201d on any headstone at a World War I cemetery makes it especially poignant.\n\n\u201cIt was a matter of minutes,\u201d said Corentin Rousman, a Belgian historian working in Mons, where British empire soldiers had their first battle with the Germans in August 1914, and also their last over four years later, when Price perished.\n\nFor Commonwealth commanders it must have been especially sweet to retake the city, bringing the war to a full circle right where they lost their first soldier, English Private John Parr who had stumbled onto the Germans on Aug. 21, 1914.\n\nIn between, World War I had claimed some 14 million lives, including 9 million soldiers, sailors and airmen from 28 countries. Early on, Germany came close to a quick victory before the conflict settled into hellish trench warfare. One battle, like the Somme in France could have up to a million casualties. Poison gas came to epitomize the cruel ruthlessness of a war the likes of which history had never seen.\n\nWhen the old European powers were close to exhaustion in the war of attrition it came to fewer nations like Gunther\u2019s United States and Price\u2019s Canada to make the difference.\n\nPrice had been a farm laborer in Saskatchewan when the swirl of history picked him off the land in 1917 as the allies sought ever more manpower to keep the Germans at bay on the Western Front.\n\nThe following summer he was part of the allied surge, and despite being gassed, he took city upon village upon city \u2014 right up to the morning of Nov. 11.\n\nNews of the impending cease-fire was already known, still he decided to go check out some homes along the historic network of industrial canals while in the center of Mons citizens already broke out the wine and whisky they had hidden for years to celebrate the liberation of their ancient medieval city.\n\n\u201cThen it is unclear what happens,\u201d said Rousman. Either Price runs out of a home to help someone or he thinks the war is over. What happened instead was that a shot rang out across a canal and Price dropped.\n\n\u201cThere no longer was any massive artillery around. It really was one man, here and there, who was driven by vengeance, by a need to kill one last time,\u201d Rousman said.\n\nAnd minutes not only counted for the dead but also for the killers.\n\n\u201cThere are rules in war,\u201d Rousman said. \u201cThere is always the possibility to kill two minutes before a cease-fire. Two minutes after, the German would have had to stand before a judge. That\u2019s the difference.\u201d\n\nThe soldier who shot Price was never identified, swallowed up in a German retreat.\n\nIn senseless death, Price made the war come full circle at the level of soldiers.\n\nWith leaves falling on Saint Symphorien cemetery just outside Mons, Price, the last Commonwealth victim killed in the war, lies within a stone\u2019s throw from Parr, the first one.\n\n\u201cHe is not forgotten,\u201d said Rousman. \u201cIt\u2019s a soldier whose tomb is often draped in flowers, notes and Canadian flags.\u201d\n\n___\n\nExcerpt from \u201cWorld War I: An AP Centennial Commemorative Edition,\u201d available at Amazon https://amzn.to/2JGrx5U", "", "Russia's Elizaveta Tuktamysheva performs during a Ladies short program of the NHK Trophy Figure Skating in Hiroshima, Western Japan, Friday, Nov. 9, 2018.

Charles de Gaulle.\n\nWith stops at once-bloody battlefields and poignant WWI memorials, Macron achieved one of his main goals: To highlight soldiers\u2019 sacrifices and sound renewed warnings about European division and rising nationalism, dangers he is increasingly concerned about.\n\nBut the commemorative pathos and broader message were also polluted by the more immediate concerns of citizens he met. In the town of Charleville-Mezieres, where Macron had his entire cabinet hold its weekly meeting, instead of in his gilded offices at the Elysee Palace in Paris, a retiree challenged him over shrinking pensions.\n\nAnd he\u2019s had to repeatedly defend his government\u2019s policies on fuel. High prices at the pumps have dominated news bulletins. Crude oil prices are largely to blame. But Macron\u2019s government has also hiked fuel taxes to fight pollution, angering drivers and truckers who plan to protest by blocking roads across France next week.\n\n\u201cI prefer taxing fuel to taxing labor. People complaining about rising fuel prices are the same ones who complain about pollution and how their children suffer,\u201d Macron said in an interview to regional newspapers.\n\nFending off criticism about fuel and pensions wasn\u2019t the main goal for Macron\u2019s aides as they carefully choreographed his tour through regions among the hardest-hit by deindustrialization and agricultural difficulties. With rates of unemployment and poverty above the national average, France\u2019s northeast is pock-marked by discontent that has proved to be fertile ground for far-right French nationalist leader Marine Le Pen, beaten by Macron in last year\u2019s presidential election.\n\nMacron said, however, that he was happy for the opportunity to deal with people\u2019s grievances directly.\n\n\u201cThere are days when people are angry,\u201d he said Thursday as he toured a Renault car factory hailed as a model of productivity. \u201cI need to explain what I do to those who are angry, to respect them and listen to them. That\u2019s what I do.\u201d\n\nThe confused and mixed messaging that came out of Macron\u2019s tour was also partly his fault. On Wednesday, he stirred controversy and angered France\u2019s main Jewish group by speaking favorably of the World War I record of Marshal Philippe Petain \u2014 a general who subsequently became a top collaborator with the Nazis in World War II.\n\nMacron\u2019s domestic troubles won\u2019t hinder his role as WWI commemoration-organizer-in-chief this weekend.\n\nIndeed, hosting Trump, Putin and other world leaders could offer a welcome moment of respite.\n\n___\n\nSylvie Corbet has covered French politics for The Associated Press since 2010.", "BARTOW, Fla.

The decline in inmates as well as the drop in incidents comes in the wake of new guidelines that were implemented a few years ago.\n\nThe average daily population in juvenile correctional centers fell to 216 inmates in fiscal year 2018. More than twice as many were in the system three years ago. Aggressive incidents in correctional centers also plummeted by nearly 90 percent.\n\nA key effort of the new program has been to lock up mostly the highest-risk youth and find alternatives for others.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Daily Press, http://www.dailypress.com/", "HUNTINGTON, W.Va.

(AP) \u2014 A fierce wildfire in Northern California incinerated most of a town of about 30,000 people with flames that moved so fast there was nothing firefighters could do, authorities said Friday. Nine people died in what quickly grew into the state\u2019s most destructive fire in at least a century.\n\nOnly a day after it began, the blaze near the town of Paradise had grown to nearly 140 square miles (362 square kilometers), had destroyed more than 6,700 structures \u2014 almost all of them homes \u2014 and was burning completely out of control.\n\n\u201cThere was really no firefight involved,\u201d Capt. Scott McLean of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said, explaining that crews gave up attacking the flames and instead helped people get out alive. \u201cThese firefighters were in the rescue mode all day yesterday.\u201d\n\nWith fires also burning in Southern California , state officials put the total number of people forced from their homes at about 250,000. Evacuation orders included the entire city of Malibu, which is home to 13,000, among them some of Hollywood\u2019s biggest stars.\n\nResidents of Paradise, California, forced to evacuate due to a wildfire are learning that many homes and businesses were destroyed. Firefighters say flames moved so fast there was nothing they could do. (Nov. 9)\n\nPresident Donald Trump issued an emergency declaration providing federal funds for Butte, Ventura and Los Angeles counties.\n\nWhen Paradise was evacuated, the order set off a desperate exodus in which many motorists got stuck in gridlocked traffic and abandoned their vehicles to flee on foot. People reported seeing much of the community go up in flames, including homes, supermarkets, businesses, restaurants, schools and a retirement center.\n\nRural areas fared little better. Many homes have propane tanks that were exploding amid the flames. \u201cThey were going off like bombs,\u201d said Karen Auday, who escaped to a nearby town.\n\nMcLean estimated that the lost buildings numbered in the thousands in Paradise, about 180 miles (290 kilometers) northeast of San Francisco.\n\n\u201cPretty much the community of Paradise is destroyed. It\u2019s that kind of devastation,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile the cause of the fire wasn\u2019t known, Pacific Gas & Electric Company told state regulators it experienced an outage on an electrical transmission line near Paradise about 15 minutes before the blaze broke out. The company said it later noticed damage to a transmission tower near the town. The utility\u2019s filing was first reported by KQED News.\n\nThe massive blaze spread north Friday, prompting officials to order the evacuation of Stirling City and Inskip, two communities north of Paradise along the Sierra Nevada foothills.\n\nThe wind-driven flames also spread to the west and reached Chico, a city of 90,000 people. Firefighters were able to stop the fire at the edge of the city, Cal Fire Cpt. Bill Murphy said.\n\nThere were no signs of life Friday on the road to Paradise except for the occasional bird chirp. A thick, yellow haze from the fire hung in the air and gave the appearance of twilight in the middle of the day.\n\nStrong winds had blown the blackened needles on some evergreens straight to one side. A scorched car with its doors open sat on the shoulder.\n\nAt one burned-out house, flames still smoldered inside what appeared to be a weight room. The rubble included a pair of dumbbells with the rubber melted off and the skeletons of a metal pullup bar and other exercise equipment. The grass and elaborate landscaping all around the brick and stucco home remained an emerald green. Red pool umbrellas were furled near lounge chairs and showed not a singe on them.\n\nEvacuees from Paradise sat in stunned silence Friday outside a Chico church where they took refuge the night before. They all had harrowing tales of a slow-motion escape from a fire so close they could feel the heat inside their vehicles as they sat stuck in a terrifying traffic jam.\n\nWhen the order came to evacuate, it was like the entire town of 27,000 residents decided to leave at once, they said. Fire surrounded the evacuation route, and drivers panicked. Some crashed and others left their vehicles by the roadside.\n\n\u201cIt was just a wall of fire on each side of us, and we could hardly see the road in front of us,\u201d police officer Mark Bass said.\n\nOfficials said all the victims were found in Paradise, including four who died inside their vehicles.\n\nA nurse called Rita Miller on Thursday morning, telling her she had to get her disabled mother, who lives a few blocks away, and flee Paradise immediately. Miller jumped in her boyfriend\u2019s rickety pickup truck, which was low on gas and equipped with a bad transmission. She instantly found herself stuck in gridlock.\n\n\u201cI was frantic,\u201d she said. After an hour of no movement, she abandoned the truck and decided to try her luck on foot. While walking, a stranger in the traffic jam rolled down her window and asked Miller if she needed help. Miller at first scoffed at the notion of getting back in a vehicle. Then she reconsidered, thinking: \u201cI\u2019m really scared. This is terrifying. I can\u2019t breathe. I can\u2019t see, and maybe I should humble myself and get in this woman\u2019s car.\u201d\n\nThe stranger helped Miller pack up her mother and took them to safety in Chico. It took three hours to travel the 14 miles.\n\nConcerned friends and family posted anxious messages on Twitter and other sites, saying they were looking for loved ones, particularly seniors who lived at retirement homes or alone.\n\nAbout 20 of the same deputies who were helping to find and rescue people lost their own homes, Sheriff Kory Honea said.\n\n\u201cThere are times when you have such rapid-moving fires ... no amount of planning is going to result in a perfect scenario, and that\u2019s what we had to deal with here,\u201d Honea told the Action News Network.\n\nKelly Lee called shelters looking for her husband\u2019s 93-year-old grandmother, Dorothy Herrera, who was last heard from Thursday morning. Herrera, who lives in Paradise with her 88-year-old husband, Lou, left a frantic voicemail around 9:30 a.m. saying they needed to get out.\n\n\u201cWe never heard from them again,\u201d Lee said. \u201cWe\u2019re worried sick. ... They do have a car, but they both are older and can be confused at times.\u201d\n\nFor one desperate day, Dawn Johnson anxiously waited for news of her father Richard Wayne Wilson and his wife, Suzanne, who lived in an RV park in Paradise that burned.

It was mostly reliant on a sharp pick-up in consumption, particularly of food and drink, during July, when temperatures regularly surpassed 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit) \u2014 a rarity for the country \u2014 and Harry Kane almost led his England team to World Cup glory.\n\nThe economy then stagnated during August and September, suggesting it remains hobbled by concerns surrounding the Brexit process, with businesses in particular reluctant to invest.\n\nThe third-quarter performance was the highest since the fourth quarter of 2016, just after the country voted to leave the European Union. It also means that Britain\u2019s growth outpaced the 0.2 percent tick recorded by the 19-country eurozone during the same period.\n\n\u201cThe economy saw a strong summer, although longer term economic growth remained subdued,\u201d said Rob Kent-Smith from the Office for National Statistics.\n\nThat was evident in the year-on-year figures: U.K. growth of 1.5 percent lags the eurozone\u2019s 1.7 percent and is dwarfed by the U.S.\u2019s 3.5 percent.\n\nBritain\u2019s economy minister, Philip Hammond, said the improvement in the quarterly figures show the \u201cunderlying strength\u201d of the economy.\n\n\u201cWe are building an economy that works for everyone, with 3.3 million more people in work, lower unemployment in every part of the country, and wages rising at their fastest pace in almost a decade,\u201d he said.\n\nWhat happens next, as Hammond has conceded, depends largely on the outcome of the Brexit discussions between the British government and the EU.\n\nThere are reports that a deal may be struck as soon as next week but there remain questions as to whether British Prime Minister Theresa May will be able to get enough lawmakers in Parliament to approve it. If lawmakers reject it, concerns would swell that Britain could crash out of the EU in March with no deal on future relations and no transition period to those new arrangements. In that scenario, tariffs would be placed on trade with the 27 other EU countries, border checks would be reinstalled, and restrictions could hit travelers and workers.\n\nSince the Brexit vote of June 2016, British consumers have largely become more cautious about spending, partly as a result of a rise in prices generated by the pound\u2019s fall. A recent pick-up in wages should shore up spending in coming months \u2014 in the absence of any Brexit shock.\n\nBusinesses have also been wary of investing in light of the uncertainty. Friday\u2019s figures showed a 1.2 percent quarterly decline in business investment, the third straight quarterly fall.\n\n\u201cThe risk of a no-deal Brexit is the clear driver of the downturn,\u201d said Samuel Tombs, chief U.K. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.\n\nMany economists think it won\u2019t become clear before next year what Brexit means for the economy and that many firms will enact contingency plans in coming months, hurting investment and hiring.\n\nThe third-quarter performance could be the best outcome for some time yet.\n\n\u201cWe think the economy has a challenging few months ahead of it,\u201d said James Smith, an economist at ING.", "MOSCOW (AP) \u2014 The Russian government risks missing a deadline to allow access to the Moscow laboratory at the center of the country\u2019s doping scandals, the head of the country\u2019s anti-doping agency said Friday.\n\nA deal between the World Anti-Doping Agency and the Russian government allowed the agency, known as RUSADA, to be reinstated in September in return for data from the lab by the end of 2018.\n\n\u201cI am feeling worried about how the situation is developing regarding access to the Moscow lab,\u201d RUSADA CEO Yuri Ganus told the Tass news agency.\n\nHe added that talks on how access should be granted have so far failed to agree on who exactly should be allowed into the lab and progress is needed \u201crapidly\u201d as the WADA board prepares to meet next week. If Russia fails to uphold its promise, Ganus said, \u201cwe will lose trust, if not forever, then for many years.\u201d\n\nGanus said he offered his help to Russian law enforcement, which sealed off the lab in 2016, but didn\u2019t get an answer.\n\nIf Russia fails to give WADA the lab data on time, or provide samples requested by WADA, then RUSADA could be suspended again. Under new WADA rules, that would make it much harder for Russia to host major sports events.\n\nAccess to the lab is also a key condition for the reinstatement of Russia\u2019s banned track and field team, which was suspended in 2015 for widespread doping.

He said he wanted to visit the U.S. soon after his election so that the voices of voters would be heard.\n\nTamaki, the first person with an American parent to lead Okinawa, said his roots make him a perfect figure to relay the message to the U.S. public.\n\nAt the center of contention is a decades-old plan to move a Marine Corps air station from densely populated Futenma in the southern part of the island to less-crowded Henoko on the east coast.\n\nMany Okinawans say the presence of so many U.S. troops on the island is burdensome and they want the Futenma base moved off the island entirely.\n\nTamaki, during an earlier visit to Tokyo in mid-October, urged Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and other top officials to stop the Henoko plan and reduce Okinawa\u2019s burden. Despite his request and Okinawans\u2019 opposition, Abe\u2019s government last week resumed construction work at the disputed site at Henoko.\n\nThe construction reignited anger on the island, and Tamaki said he is determined to block its completion.\n\n\u201cOkinawa is working hard toward peace building, and based on that perspective we call on the Japanese government and the United States government to look at ways to reduce the burden of the bases and build peace. We call for deepening of their relationship and effort to achieve those goals,\u201d Tamaki said.\n\nHe said Japan\u2019s central government should negotiate with the U.S. in Okinawa\u2019s interest. \u201cAs the central government is not delivering Okinawans\u2019 voice to the U.S. side, it is now my responsibility to convey that directly to the Americans and they have a responsibility to listen to us,\u201d Tamaki said.\n\nHe has said he supports the Japan-U.S. security alliance, but that Okinawa should not be the only place forced to sacrifice.\n\nTamaki has also called for a review of the Status of Forces Agreement that gives privileges to the U.S. military, including some immunity from Japanese criminal investigation. Some experts say inequality under the agreement is greater in Japan than in nations that host U.S. forces in Europe.\n\nThe relocation of Futenma air station was planned after the 1995 rape of a schoolgirl in which three U.S. servicemen were convicted. The case ignited simmering Okinawan opposition to the U.S. bases.\n\nAbout half of the 50,000 U.S. troops based in Japan under the security pact and most of their key facilities are on Okinawa. Residents have long complained about base-related noise, pollution and crime.\n\nTamaki, the son of an American serviceman whom he has never seen, said he was bullied as a child because of his lighter skin color and reddish hair.

(AP) \u2014 At 43, Baylor coach Matt Rhule is far removed from a playing career. That doesn\u2019t mean he won\u2019t run the gauntlet with his guys to prove a point.\n\nWhen Rhule was helping turn around the program at Temple, he already had many of his players outfitted with XTECH shoulder pads, a revolutionary protective device that is gaining traction on all levels of football.\n\n\u201cI even wore the XTECH pads and went through bull-in-the-ring while I was at Temple,\u201d he recalls, \u201cand I can tell you that the next day I felt less sore than I should have felt.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the refrain from many a player, including NFL stars such as Khalil Mack, Matt Ryan, Odell Beckham Jr., and Andrew Luck \u2014 who missed an entire season because of shoulder issues.\n\n\u201cI had a unique history after being at the New York Giants where several players wore the XTECH pads ,\u201d says Rhule, who left Temple for Baylor in 2016. \u201cThen Muhammad Wilkerson, who played for me at Temple, was a proponent of the pads. I had a chance to see them work firsthand. When we went to Temple, we put them on several guys, and they all had positive reviews. Shoulder injuries went down. Upon coming to Baylor, we had a chance to implement the same thing. We\u2019ve watched our occurrence of injuries and postseason surgeries come down subsequently.\n\n\u201cThe pads have been shown to work at a high level, and we have had tremendous personal success with them. The vast majority of our players have enjoyed the pads and appreciated the commitment to their health and welfare. I\u2019ve even had other coaches reach out to me over the years to ask about them.\u201d\n\nThat seems to be the reaction from high schools \u2014 famed Mater Dei in Santa Ana, California, originally bought three sets and now the entire team is wearing XTECH \u2014 to college, where company co-founder Bob Broderick says close to 500 schools across all levels have players suiting up in the pads, with virtually the entire Washington State roster using them.\n\nDozens of players at the likes of Michigan, Penn State, Syracuse, Mississippi and Notre Dame use the pads.\n\nAs for the pros \u2014 the NFL does not survey shoulder pads as it does helmets \u2014 Patriots running back James White, in the midst of the finest season of his five-year career, says: \u201cI like that the pads are light and give me a lot of range to move my arms. But at the same time, they give me all the protection my shoulders need. I\u2019ve always given thought to my shoulder pads because as a person who runs and catches the football, I feel like you should have the right pads to help you get your job done.\u201d\n\nXTECH has been on the job for six years, though the work staff is small: 11 full-timers, seven part-timers. That could be increased as Broderick and co-founder Ted Monica break into the European market; there are distribution deals in place for January to expand in Germany, Switzerland and the UK. Also next year, XTECH will make available its first five-padded girdle; most states require all high school football players to wear a five-padded girdle.\n\nTheir Cover-2 Program works with NFL teams, current and former coaches and players to buy pads and donate them back to their high schools. Zach Ertz, Melvin Gordon and the McCourty brothers have done so, and the Giants donated equipment to the New York Police Department\u2019s football squad.\n\nMonica has worked in the football equipment world for nearly 38 years. He custom designs every pad, which Broderick says are the only pads made entirely in the United States.\n\nWhat makes those pads stand out?\n\nThe patented design features the only dual-cantilever system on the market, an adjustable three-piece body system that allows each pad to fit the player\u2019s body at the proper angle while creating a natural channel for the AC joint to sit in. On the performance side, a three-point swivel system allows for enhanced range of motion, and air flow occurs into the front and back to work in conjunction with uniforms, allowing for maximum ventilation.\n\nAdditionally, XTECH uses XRD Technology, which is well known in the military space and is the foam XTECH uses in the entire pad. XRD, a division of Rogers Corporation, has a multi-year exclusive partnership with XTECH for American football. Monica calls it \u201csmart foam,\u201d which is water resistant as well as highly protective and durable.\n\nThe majority of the shoulder pad industry uses foam from China and an \u201cair management\u201d system which was developed in the 1970s. Think of a pillow and every time you hit it air goes out the side, and it compresses down and is therefore less protective for the subsequent hit.\n\nAccording to many of the players using XTech\u2019s pads, that\u2019s never been a concern.\n\nRecent company addition Brooks Barnard is the vice president of sales and left Under Armour after 12 years overseeing its high school properties to join XTECH. He was attracted by XTech\u2019s implementing \u201can idea that was disruptive and challenged a predictable way of thinking.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs I spent time in locker rooms across the country, I noticed the XTECH brand growing in popularity with elite athletes as their choice of pads to wear on Friday nights,\u201d he says. \u201cThe design of XTECH naturally captures your attention and automatically engages any football mind. It was evident that XTECH was sought by top players at the NFL and NCAA level and a groundswell was happening at the high school level. Several of the nationally ranked programs in the country already had players in XTECH and I witnessed first-hand what top recruits were saying about the pad.\u201d\n\nIf anyone needs a reliable shoulder pad, naturally it is Luck. The first overall selection in the 2012 draft and the Colts\u2019 franchise QB since then never suited up in 2017. He\u2019s back now and having a strong season despite a general dearth of talent around him.\n\nLuck is intrigued by technology, but his reasons for switching to XTECH appear simpler.\n\n\u201cJust a little lighter,\u201d Luck says. \u201cBeen wearing the same shoulder pads and thought I\u2019d try a new one out. It didn\u2019t come from a place that I need something different, I need more protection. It was just some new technology that our equipment managers came to me about and it\u2019s worked well so far.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "Official: Woman charged in fatal crash may have fled country\n\nHENRICO, Va.

(AP Photo/Gary Cameron, File)\n\nIf all goes according to form, Ohio State would face Michigan on the last Saturday of the month, with a division title in the balance.\n\nBefore that, though, the Buckeyes have other challenges.\n\nThis week, it\u2019s Michigan State that stands in the way, and although Ohio State routed the Spartans 48-3 a season ago, there have been enough tight games in this series lately that Saturday\u2019s matchup should have the eighth-ranked Buckeyes\u2019 attention. The 24th-ranked Spartans will be at home, and they still have a lot to play for themselves.\n\n\u201cVery strong rivalry,\u201d Ohio State coach Urban Meyer said. \u201cWe have a lot of respect for that team.\u201d\n\nThe rivalry with Michigan can wait: Ohio State quarterback Dwayne Haskins Jr. was apparently willing to solicit help from Wolverines QB Shea Patterson while preparing for this matchup with Michigan State. Haskins said he and Patterson have known each other since eighth grade from football all-star games and camps, and they\u2019ve spoken about the Spartans.\n\n\u201cI hit him up asking how they played defensively, and he just gave me some tips going into this week,\u201d Haskins said.\n\nHaskins said he doesn\u2019t even root against Patterson as long as the Wolverines are playing someone else.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s doing well this year,\u201d Haskins said. \u201cLooking forward to playing them when we do play them. But right now it\u2019s Michigan State, so he\u2019s helping me out with Michigan State.\u201d\n\nPatterson led Michigan to a 21-7 win over the Spartans on Oct. 20, but Michigan State (6-3, 4-2 Big Ten, No. 18 CFP) can still position itself for a prestigious bowl with a strong finish. A win over the Buckeyes (8-1, 5-1, No. 10) would do wonders.\n\n\u201cOnce we kind of get toward the end of the season, and you start seeing the bowl predictions,\u201d Spartans quarterback Brian Lewerke said. \u201cAll that we can do now, now that we\u2019re in bowl position, is just win out and try to win as many games as we can, just keep trying to get to a better and better bowl for us.\u201d\n\nHere are a few things to know before the Spartans host the Buckeyes:\n\nHISTORY\n\nMichigan State beat Ohio State en route to Big Ten titles in 2013 and 2015, but the Buckeyes won a key matchup against the Spartans in 2014 and went on to win the national title.\n\nAs competitive as Michigan State has been with Meyer\u2019s Buckeyes, the Spartans have lost their last six home games in this series.\n\nBACKING HIS MAN\n\nLewerke has started most of the season at quarterback for Michigan State, but he\u2019s dealt with an injured shoulder recently, and Rocky Lombardi has done some good things in relief. Spartans coach Mark Dantonio tried to put some of the uncertainty to rest this week.\n\n\u201cBrian is our starting quarterback, I think you can go with that,\u201d Dantonio said. \u201cIs he 100 percent? Nobody is ever 100 percent 10 games into the season, but if he could not play, he would not play.\u201d\n\nON THE RUN\n\nMichigan State has the nation\u2019s top-ranked run defense, but Ohio State isn\u2019t likely to be intimidated. The Buckeyes ran for 335 yards in last season\u2019s blowout. J.K.

Ohio State was ranked No. 2 when it lost to Michigan State in 2013 and 2015.\n\nON A ROLL\n\nHaskins may not need much help from Patterson or anyone else.

Michigan State\u2019s offense is 116th in the country in yards per play (5.00) and has been shuffling between Brian Lewerke, who has been dealing with a shoulder injury, and redshirt freshman Rocky Lombardi.

Mayweather said he has signed to fight Nasukawa for a bout promoted by Japan's RIZIN Fighting Federation on Dec. 31 in Saitama, north of Tokyo. (Katsuya Miyagawa/Kyodo News via AP)\n\nIt looked like easy money, and there\u2019s no one more qualified to judge that then the founder and titular head of The Money Team.\n\nBut sometimes chasing a pile of cash is more difficult than it seems.\n\nFloyd Mayweather Jr. found that out when he went looking for money in Japan. The deal, or so he thought, was to perform a three-round exhibition before what he said was a small group of wealthy spectators for \u201ca very large fee.\u201d\n\nTurns out Mayweather got hoodwinked. And then he quickly got out of town.\n\nHe wanted no part of a rising young Japanese kickboxing star, even though he outweighed Tenshin Nasukawa by 30 pounds. A guy could get hurt in a real fight, especially if the rules weren\u2019t all in his favor.\n\nThe problem was, Mayweather had appeared at a press conference Monday in Tokyo in which the fight was announced. He posed for pictures with Nasukawa, and talked about how their New Year\u2019s Eve bout would be an epic event.\n\nSo he had to backpedal. And fast.\n\nMayweather said he was blindsided by promoters at the press conference and went along when they said the fight was scheduled, with the rules to be figured out later. He said he didn\u2019t even know who Nasukawa was.\n\nFair enough. But Google is available in Japan, and it didn\u2019t take Mayweather long to find out a few things about his opponent.\n\nOr maybe he just read an Instagram post from Joe Rogan, the UFC fight announcer who knew a little more about Nasukawa.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a true striking genius,\u201d Rogan said of the 20-year-old. \u201cI doubt Floyd is going to agree to any rules that allow Tenshin to kick, but if he does, it could be a terrible night for him. This kid is the truth.\u201d\n\nWhatever it was, Mayweather left Japan as fast as he could.\n\nAnd, really, who could blame Mayweather. He\u2019s made a career \u2014 and made himself immensely wealthy \u2014 out of picking just the right opponent at the right time and this wasn\u2019t the opponent or the time to get back in the ring.\n\nBut in doing so he may have damaged his brand, if just a bit. Mayweather doesn\u2019t do contrition well, but contrite he was in a lengthy post that didn\u2019t exactly cast him in a favorable light.\n\n\u201cI am a retired boxer that earns an unprecedented amount of money, globally, for appearances, speaking engagements and occasional small exhibitions,\u201d Mayweather wrote.\n\nIf that\u2019s so, then perhaps Manny Pacquiao better go looking for another opponent for his next fight. Actually, Pacquiao already has, with plans to fight Adrien Broner in January.\n\nStill there\u2019s a good chance the two could meet in May in Las Vegas in a rematch of their first fight. By then they might have made enough boxing fans forget what a snoozer the first fight was to pay big money for a rematch between two 40-something boxers.\n\nWith Mayweather, it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess. He already announced the Pacquiao fight for December, you might remember, though it will not happen then.\n\nAnd now he claims he\u2019s just an old retired boxer trying to make a little spending money by giving speeches and small exhibitions.\n\nWho\u2019s going to pay big money to see that?\n\nIt\u2019s hard to argue with what Mayweather has done in a career more spectacular for the amount of money he\u2019s made than the epic fights he\u2019s been in. He turned himself into a marketing phenomenon beginning with his 2007 fight with Oscar De La Hoya, and has made more money than even he can count.\n\nHe also conned people into believing his fight with UFC fighter Conor McGregor was a legitimate match, before easily dispatching him in his last lucrative exhibition.\n\nBut the Mayweather brand is getting old, and so is his appeal. He\u2019s reduced to being the \u201copponent\u201d in fights like the one he was planning in Japan and even his sycophants have to be getting the idea by now that they\u2019re being played.\n\nA second fight with Pacquiao holds little intrigue after the dull affair the two put on in 2015. Like the proposed fight in Japan it\u2019s strictly a money grab by the founder of The Money Team.\n\nIn the end, Mayweather couldn\u2019t run fast enough from a young opponent in Japan.\n\nWe should all think about running if his next press conference is to announce a fight with Pacquiao.\n\n____\n\nTim Dahlberg is a national sports columnist for The Associated Press.

O\u2019Ree is being inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame on Monday for his pioneering career, and yet incidents like the one Smith-Pelly went through show how much more progress needs to be made, in a league that\u2019s 97 percent white and beyond.\n\nAs Willie O\u2019Ree goes into Hall of Fame 60 years after breaking NHL color barrier, AP Hockey Writer @SWhyno reports race and hockey is still very much a work in progress https://t.co/b0YENcJe1S pic.twitter.com/k5RXY3DJI4 \u2014 AP Sports (@AP_Sports) November 9, 2018\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s come a long way, but there\u2019s still a lot of things that still need to change,\u201d Edmonton defenseman Darnell Nurse said. \u201cThat just comes through minorities as a group working together to try to eliminate those things from this game.\u201d\n\nThose things just keep happening.\n\nIn 2011, Philadelphia forward Wayne Simmonds had a banana thrown at him during a preseason game in London, Ontario.\n\nIn 2012, then-Washington forward Joel Ward was the subject of racist social media posts after he scored a game-winning playoff goal.\n\nIn 2014, then-Montreal defenseman P.K. Subban was the subject of racist social media posts after he scored a game-winning playoff goal.\n\nIn April, Detroit prospect Givani Smith was subjected to threats and racial taunts and messages after a junior game in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. His team had a police escort the next time they went to the rink.\n\n\u2033(O\u2019Ree) had to go through a lot, and the same thing has been happening now, which obviously means there\u2019s still a long way to go,\u201d Smith-Pelly said. \u201cIf you had pulled a quote from him back then and us now, they\u2019re saying the same thing, so obviously there\u2019s still a long way to go in hockey and in the world if we\u2019re being serious.\u201d\n\nThrough his work as an NHL diversity ambassador over the past 20 years, O\u2019Ree has tried to work toward more inclusion and better minority representation. He is eager to tell kids at YMCAs, Boys & Girls Clubs and schools that hockey is another sport they can play.\n\nUSA Hockey and Hockey Canada don\u2019t keep participation statistics by race, though there are fewer than two dozen black players currently on NHL rosters. The NHL celebrates \u201cHockey is for Everyone\u201d month each season and quickly condemns racist behavior.\n\n\u201cA lot of it\u2019s basically on your parents and how people raise their kids,\u201d said San Jose forward Evander Kane, who acknowledged being the subject of racist taunting as the only black player on his minor league teams in Vancouver. \u201cYou can have all the awareness that you want, but at the end of the day, it\u2019s really up to the individual and how they act and how they want to treat other people.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Ree, 83, still remembers how he was treated in the \u201950s as hockey\u2019s Jackie Robinson. He did his best to drown out the noise by listening to his brother Richard.\n\n\u201cI heard the jeers and some of the racial remarks, but it kind of went in one ear and out the other,\u201d O\u2019Ree said. \u201cHe told me, \u2018Willie, names will never hurt you unless you let them.\u2019 He said, \u2018If they can\u2019t accept you for the individual that you are, just forget about it and just go out and do what you do best and don\u2019t worry about anything else.\u2019\u201d\n\nNurse said black players still have to worry about racist jeers and remarks.\n\n\u201cI had a lot growing up and my brother had the big one too last year,\u201d said Dallas forward Gemel Smith, Givani\u2019s brother. \u201cHow we were raised, nothing really bothers me. That stuff doesn\u2019t really get to me and things like that. My dad always taught us just to try to close it out, block it out.\u201d\n\nLike Smith-Pelly, Simmonds is quick to say racism isn\u2019t an issue unique to hockey or sports in general. His solution is a zero tolerance policy, which is what happened to the four fans in Chicago who were thrown out and banned from all home games by the Blackhawks.\n\n\u201cI think what could be done to keep these types of incidents from happening would probably be to ban those people who are doing those lewd acts,\u201d Simmonds said. \u201cI think if you set a strong example right from the start, you won\u2019t have too many people acting like clowns.\u201d\n\nCommissioner Gary Bettman, who is going into the Hall of Fame with O\u2019Ree as part of the class of 2018, considers it important to make clear to fans and players what\u2019s expected and what\u2019s not tolerated and said: \u201cEven if it\u2019s only one incident, it\u2019s one too many.\u201d Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly said creating and cultivating an inclusive environment and building diversity are significant league priorities.\n\nThere has been incremental progress. In the aftermath of Smith-Pelly\u2019s incident, fans in Chicago raised $23,000 to donate to the Fort Dupont Ice Rink in Washington, helping hundreds of children.\n\n\u201cWhen you see the reaction and the way that people rally around moments like that and try to make a positive out of it, I think that\u2019s definitely a step in the right direction,\u201d Nurse said.\n\nFor some players like Seth Jones, the son of former NBA player Popeye Jones, hockey has been a safe place. The Blue Jackets defenseman said he has so far never been on the receiving end of race-based taunts or messages and said, \u201cI was just like everybody else playing hockey, which is what everyone wants.\u201d\n\nMost black players haven\u2019t been that fortunate. And while Jones is optimistic that people can change, Smith-Pelly wasn\u2019t sure exactly how that will happen.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t really know a plan to stop it.

The top teams are very exciting and there are plenty of high-scoring games,\u201d said Neal Pilson, the former president of CBS Sports who now runs his own sports television consulting company.\n\nPilson said a major ratings driver has been the emergence of young quarterbacks like the Rams\u2019 Jared Goff, the Chiefs\u2019 Patrick Mahomes and the Bears\u2019 Mitchell Trubisky. That has created a buzz not only with their teams but throughout the league.\n\nAnother factor is that player protests against social and racial injustice during the national anthem have not been a major storyline this season.

NBC has seen increases all but one week compared to last season.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to the second half of our schedule, which features many crucial divisional matchups, the Thanksgiving night game, plus the Week 17 flex game.

Pilson has been critical of scheduling for Thursday and Monday nights in past seasons, but he said the league has made improvements in those areas. ESPN will have one of the marquee games of the season on Nov. 19 when Kansas City faces the Los Angeles Rams in Mexico City.\n\n\u201cFor years I thought that they were burying those two nights but they have improved dramatically,\u201d he said.\n\nCBS\u2019s Sunday afternoon games are averaging 15.713 million viewers, which is up 1 percent from last season (15.528 million). This past Sunday\u2019s slate of five games, which was headlined by Pittsburgh at Baltimore, had a 10.0 household rating, which was up 23 percent from the same week last season.\n\nCBS Sports chairman Sean McManus, whose network has the 2019 Super Bowl, has been pleased with advertising sales for the rest of the season and the Feb. 3 championship game in Atlanta.\n\n\u201cThere are a number of very good stories. Kansas City is a team of national interest, Mahomes has become a legit star and a lot of the big teams \u2014 including New Orleans, Pittsburgh and New England \u2014 are playing very well,\u201d he said.\n\nFox\u2019s Sunday afternoon coverage is averaging more viewers than CBS at 17.299 million, but this is a decrease of less than 1 percent from last season (17.414 million).\n\nThe only package that has sharply declined is Thursday Night Football. It is averaging 12.522 million viewers in its first season on Fox, which is down from the 14.134 million on CBS last season. Fox is hopeful that the numbers can rebound over the next month, which includes Green Bay at Seattle (Nov. 15), New Orleans at Dallas (Nov. 29) and the Los Angeles Chargers at Kansas City (Dec. 13).\n\nPilson and McManus think the league\u2019s overall improvements could carry through the second half. That\u2019s even better news for McManus, as he sees a number of potential Super Bowl matchups that would bode well for CBS.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m encouraged. There are a lot of good storylines that will carry throughout the next couple months,\u201d he said. \u201cWith so much going on that is negative, people are looking for an escape and football provides that for a lot of people.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\n___\n\nFollow Joe Reedy at www.twitter.com/joereedy", "In this Oct. 31, 2018, photo, a staff members walks past a semi truck loaded with new vehicles in the parking lot for a local automaker in Qingdao in eastern China's Shandong province.

I\u2019m not a bad guy. I\u2019ve always been a good guy,\u201d Bryant said after his first practice with New Orleans on Thursday afternoon. \u201cYou can ask my teammates \u2014 my ex-teammates \u2014 how I am. I love the locker room. It\u2019s like family. Every locker room that I\u2019ve been in \u2014 from middle school, high school, college, to the pros \u2014 it\u2019s always been like a family.\u201d\n\nBryant was reticent when asked to go into detail about interest shown in him by other clubs. He is known to have met with Cleveland and Baltimore before his workout with New Orleans this week earned him a spot on a Saints offense that currently ranks seventh in the NFL and is led by the NFL\u2019s all-time leader in completions and yards passing.\n\nVideo: New #Saints WR Dez Bryant after his first practice pic.twitter.com/76K8EYKtqn \u2014 Brett Martel (@brettmartel) November 9, 2018\n\n\u201cWho wouldn\u2019t want to play with Drew Brees,\u201d said Bryant, who caught passes from Brees at practice on Thursday. \u201cNot taking away from nobody else, but you got a guy like Drew Brees, like I said, you got a guy like Michael Thomas, (Ben) Watson, Alvin Kamara, Mark Ingram. You got those types of guys.\u201d\n\nBryant spent his first eight NFL seasons with Dallas and in 2017 caught 69 passes for 838 yards and six touchdowns, including a 50-yard scoring play, for the Cowboys.\n\nHowever, his professional reputation has been marred at times by public confrontations with coaches and teammates during games and practices.\n\nLast season was Bryant\u2019s best since he caught 88 passes for 1,320 yards and 16 TDs in 2014, which at the time was his third consecutive season with at least 1,200 yards receiving. He signed his last Cowboys contract right after that, but has not approached that level of production since \u2014 a central reason Dallas released him in April with two years left on his five-year, $70 million contract.\n\nSaints players sounded eager to see how Bryant might help.\n\nThomas, who is New Orleans\u2019 leading receiver, said he has been following Bryant\u2019s career.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s definitely one of those guys you have to watch if you\u2019re playing the receiver position,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cHe\u2019s a guy who\u2019s done some great things at the position, so you just have to respect it and pick his brain. I asked him a lot of questions, and it\u2019s just cool to play with a guy like that.\u201d\n\nSaints coach Sean Payton said Thursday that Bryant would be taking the spot on the active roster vacated by receiver Cameron Meredith, a free-agent signing last offseason who is coming back from a major knee injury, and who went on injured reserve after he and the club agreed he\u2019d benefit from undergoing an arthroscopic cleanup on that same knee.\n\n\u201cHe kept having the swelling week in and week out and he really was pushing through it,\u201d Payton said.\n\nReceiver Ted Ginn Jr. also is on injured reserve and cannot come back until the final few weeks of the regular season, if he\u2019s ready by then.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how soon Bryant will have a regular role in New Orleans\u2019 offense. Payton said Bryant is perhaps five pounds heavier than his ideal playing weight, which would be common among players who did not go through a training camp.\n\nBut Payton added, \u201cwe felt like he did a number of things that we liked in the workout.\u201d\n\nThe signing sets the stage for Bryant to play in Dallas when the Saints visit the Cowboys for a Thursday night game on Nov. 29.\n\n\u201cI am going to be excited. I\u2019ll get to see all the Cowboys fans. You know I still love those guys. I love my ex-teammates. They\u2019re my family,\u201d Bryant said. \u201cBut I\u2019m here on a new chapter. It\u2019s going to be fun, but I\u2019m the opponent now.\u201d\n\nBryant said he is \u201cnot at all\u201d bitter about his departure from the Cowboys, adding, \u201cThat chapter\u2019s closed.

Nikema Williams, the Georgia director for Care In Action, which advocates for more than 2 million domestic workers and care workers nationwide.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the cradle of the civil rights movement, the home of Congressman John Lewis who literally bled on the bridge at Selma to make sure that everybody had the right to vote,\u201d she said.\n\nMarisa Franco, 27, saw a friend\u2019s Facebook post about the effort, then showed up at the warehouse to volunteer Friday morning.\n\n\u201cI think that it\u2019s really central to democracy that everybody who is eligible to vote can vote and has the least amount of barriers possible, so I\u2019m just here to make sure that every vote counts,\u201d she said.\n\nOn Friday night, a judge ordered Dougherty County to accept absentee ballots postmarked by Election Day and received by Friday.\n\nThe Abrams campaign filed a complaint in federal court asking for an injunction to direct the board of elections to count any absentee ballots received between 7 p.m. on Election Day and close of business Friday, which is consistent with the way that counting overseas military and overseas citizens\u2019 ballots is handled.\n\nRaces for governor and U.S. Senate also are tight in Florida, which Trump referred to in a tweet that said: \u201cYou mean they are just now finding votes in Florida and Georgia \u2014 but the Election was on Tuesday? Let\u2019s blame the Russians and demand an immediate apology from President Putin!\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s message refers to allegations that Russian interference helped him win in 2016, but it wasn\u2019t clear exactly what the president meant about votes being found.\n\nReturns show Kemp with 50.3 percent of almost 4 million votes, a roughly 63,000-vote lead over Abrams. That\u2019s a narrow sum, considering the near-presidential election year turnout, though sufficient for the majority required for outright victory.\n\nThe Associated Press has not declared a winner in the race for Georgia governor. The AP will reassess the race Tuesday, the deadline for counties to certify election results to the state.\n\nWith legal wrangles opening and Abrams showing no signs of conceding, the dispute is prolonging a bitter contest with historical significance and national political repercussions.\n\nAbrams\u2019 campaign manager, Lauren Groh-Wargo, said Kemp was to blame for problems because he was the secretary of state, Georgia\u2019s top election official, and tried to tamp down minority votes.\n\n\u201cThese suppressive tactics are reminiscent of the Old South, tactics that have been resurrected by Brian Kemp, who forced the state to allow him to oversee his own election, and had him be the decider on who was the winner,\u201d she said at a news conference.\n\nKemp contends he did his job properly and has argued that Abrams wants to help noncitizens vote illegally. Kemp, who has echoed Trump\u2019s immigration rhetoric, cited a speech in which Abrams said \u201cundocumented\u201d people were part of her coalition.\n\nAbrams would become the first black woman elected governor of any U.S. state. Kemp seeks to maintain Republican dominance in a growing, diversifying Deep South state positioned to become a presidential battleground.\n\nThe key question is how many uncounted ballots actually remain.\n\nKemp said Thursday that it\u2019s fewer than 21,000 \u2014 almost certainly not enough to force a runoff. Abrams\u2019 campaign argues the total could be higher, and the secretary of state\u2019s office has shared scant details as officials in Georgia\u2019s 159 counties keep counting.\n\nAbrams\u2019 campaign has reserved television advertising time and started sending vote-by-mail information to supporters in case she forces a Dec. 4 runoff with Kemp.\n\n___\n\nAP writer Errin Haines Whack contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow Barrow on Twitter at https://twitter.com/BillBarrowAP.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "FILE - In this Saturday, Nov. 3, 2018, file photo, Purdue quarterback David Blough (11) runs with the ball in the first half of an NCAA college football game against Iowa in West Lafayette, Ind. Purdue needs one more win to become bowl eligible, but the Boilermakers are chasing more than that, still with an outside chance at winning the Big Ten West Division, where Minnesota sits at the bottom thanks to a reeling defense. (AP Photo/AJ Mast, File)\n\nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 Favorable field position has meant little for Minnesota this season, as huge gains against the Gophers have piled up as if opponents are playing a video game.\n\nThis will be an especially difficult week for the defense to try to stem this tide of long touchdowns, with Purdue\u2019s offense possessing as much quick-strike ability as any team in the Big Ten.\n\n\u201cExplosive players everywhere,\u201d said Gophers coach P.J. Fleck, who fired defensive coordinator Robb Smith last weekend after a 55-31 loss at Illinois.\n\nMinnesota (4-5, 1-5) has allowed an average of 43 points per conference game, with 32 touchdowns by their foes covering a staggering mean distance of 35 yards. Thirteen of those touchdowns are plays of 40-plus yards, including eight of 60 yards or more.\n\nWith fifth-year quarterback David Blough thriving under the direction of coach Jeff Brohm and wide receiver Rondale Moore emerging as one of the nation\u2019s most impactful freshmen, Purdue (5-4, 4-2) has already produced 22 offensive plays this year that netted 40 yards. The Boilermakers are 13th in the FBS with an average of 486 yards per game.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fun when you come to the facility to work. Coach Brohm is creative. We\u2019re confident because we know we\u2019ve got the best play-caller in the country,\u201d said Blough, who\u2019s second in the Big Ten and 12th in the FBS with an average of 298 passing yards per game.\n\nPurdue\u2019s one-point loss at home to Eastern Michigan on a last-second field goal still hurts a little, despite the potentially program-elevating 29-point victory last month against Ohio State and the two-point win over Iowa last week, because the Boilermakers have not yet secured eligibility for a bowl game thanks to their 0-3 start.\n\nWith Purdue lugging a 12-game losing streak to Wisconsin when they play on Nov. 17, the Boilermakers don\u2019t want to put themselves in the precarious position of needing to win at rival Indiana on Nov. 24 to extend their season. So they\u2019ll have to be wary of a letdown against the Gophers, having opened as nine-point favorites.\n\nOf course, the Boilermakers remain in the race for the West Division title, the greatest reminder to avoid overlooking reeling Minnesota. First-place Northwestern owns the tiebreaker, having defeated Purdue in the opener, but the Wildcats play at Iowa on Saturday before finishing at Minnesota and against Illinois. Wisconsin plays at Penn State on Saturday and wraps up against Minnesota.\n\n\u201cIn our mind, we have to win to advance and stay a contender,\u201d Brohm said.\n\nHere are some other key angles to follow with the game on Saturday afternoon:\n\nWRAP UP: Minnesota allowed 659 total yards to Nebraska and 646 total yards to Illinois, which rank fourth and seventh on the all-time single-game list by opponents. The only other year with multiple entries on the top 10 list was 1983, when the Gophers went 1-10 and infamously lost 84-13 to Nebraska.\n\nRegardless of any issues with scheme or depth, all those big plays allowed by the Gophers have signified a glaring problem with the basics of pursuit angles and completing tackles. Interim defensive coordinator Joe Rossi, who was the defensive coordinator at Rutgers before joining Fleck\u2019s staff before last season, made a point to intensify the practices this week.\n\n\u201cWe just want to leave it better than we found it,\u201d Rossi said.\n\nSLOWER GOING\n\nIn addition to the potential spark the Gophers could find with the new voice directing their defense, they\u2019ll have another factor on their side: a predicted high temperature of 27 degrees.\n\n\u201cOur guys are going to have to have some toughness and be able to play strong, play through the elements and find ways to win,\u201d Brohm said.\n\nAIR IT OUT\n\nWith freshman Rashod Bateman coming off a 175-yard game against Illinois and junior Tyler Johnson leading the conference in receiving yards, one spot ahead of Moore, the Gophers can match the Boilermakers through the air. Purdue is third-to-last in the FBS with an average of 296 passing yards per game.\n\nON THE EDGE\n\nDefensive end Carter Coughlin, who leads the Big Ten with nine sacks, is Minnesota\u2019s best hope of disrupting Blough and the Boilermakers. He could be lined up some against left tackle Eric Swingler, who has stepped in for the injured Grant Hermanns for a second straight year. Coughlin described his mood after the Illinois game as \u201cbeyond angry\u201d after the latest discouraging performance by the defense. He\u2019s expecting improvement on Saturday.\n\n\u201cWithout a doubt,\u201d Coughlin said. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen anybody quit.\u201d\n\nLOOKING BACK\n\nMinnesota has a 37-33-3 edge in the all-time series, including 31-12-3 at home. Purdue has lost in each of first four trips to TCF Bank Stadium, allowing an average of 41 points per game, with the last road win over the Gophers coming at the Metrodome on Sept. 22, 2007. The Boilermakers have lost six of the last nine overall.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football coverage: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "FILE - In this Sept. 22, 2018, file photo, Army' Darnell Woolfolk (33) carries as Oklahoma linebacker Curtis Bolton (18) defends during an NCAA college football game in Norman, Okla.

(AP) \u2014 Army coach Jeff Monken scoffed at the notion his Black Knights could face a trap game.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not a good enough football team to let down against anybody,\u201d Monken said. \u201cOur guys understand what needs to be done. We\u2019ve got to continue to strive to be as close to perfect as we can.\u201d\n\nArmy (7-2) matched a school record last year with 10 wins and is on track to reach double figures again behind its triple option. The Black Knights are averaging 306.6 yards rushing a game, second nationally, as they get set to play Championship Subdivision (FCS) foe Lafayette (3-6) on Saturday at Michie Stadium.\n\n\u201cArmy presents some unique situations because of the style of their offense,\u201d Lafayette coach John Garrett said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to create a situation where you just build a wall and limit the space that they can run. That\u2019s what we\u2019ll try to do.\u201d\n\nThe Black Knights edged service academy rival Air Force 17-14 in an emotion-packed victory last week that kept the coveted Commander in Chief\u2019s Trophy at West Point for a second straight year. Army has won five in a row since an overtime loss at then-No. 5 Oklahoma and has won 11 straight at home.\n\nLafayette has struggled this season. The Leopards are averaging just 14.1 points per game and allowing more than double that at 28.7.\n\nMonken isn\u2019t taking anything for granted.\n\n\u201cThey (fans) don\u2019t realize the ability level they (the Leopards) have,\u201d Monken said. \u201cThey\u2019re the same guys we\u2019re playing with. It\u2019s a lot closer than people realize from FBS to FCS. We\u2019re going to have to play our best. That\u2019s a fact.\u201d\n\nLafayette is one of two FCS teams on this year\u2019s Army schedule, and playing teams at Division I\u2019s second level can pose problems.\n\n\u201cYou have to practice against several different defenses, and it\u2019s hard to zero in on attacking one type of front against their coverages,\u201d Monken said. \u201cThat makes it really difficult. Frankly, we have no idea what they\u2019re going to line up in on defense. We have no film of them playing against option teams.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve (also) just done so many different things offensively,\u201d Monken added. \u201cThey\u2019re very aggressive with the way they play. Often times, when teams are that multiple and you\u2019re not sure what you\u2019re going to get, it almost forces you to back off the gas a little bit and be more conservative.\u201d\n\nOther things to know when Army hosts Lafayette at Michie Stadium on Saturday:\n\nVETERANS DAY\n\nIn honor of Veterans Day, Lafayette will be wearing special decals on its helmets to honor the military. Members of the team were asked to choose someone close to them who has served or is serving in the military. Players then supplied photos, which have been incorporated into the L on the helmets.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a great atmosphere,\u201d Garrett said. \u201cIt\u2019s a great place to play.\u201d\n\nDOUBLE TROUBLE\n\nArmy QB Kelvin Hopkins Jr. and FB Darnell Woolfolk are leading the team with 671 and 665 yards rushing, respectively. Woolfolk tops the team with nine TDs, one more than his backfield mate.\n\nFEW FLAGS\n\nBoth teams have displayed discipline when it comes to penalties. The Leopards are averaging 4.2 penalties per game, fifth in the nation, for 38 yards per game, second nationally. Lafayette was not called for a penalty against Monmouth in mid-September, the first time it\u2019s been penalty-free in a game since November 2006 against Lehigh. Army has been penalized 44 times for 446 yards, an average of 49.5 yards and 4.9 penalties per game. The latter figure is tied for 20th in FBS.\n\nHELLO OLD FRIENDS\n\nLafayette defensive coordinator Luke Thompson was on the Army staff in charge of special teams under former coach Rich Ellerson. And Leopards DL Harrison Greenhill spent the 2017-18 school year at West Point before transferring to Lafayette and has started eight of nine games this season, racking up 37 tackles and six tackles for a loss. Greenhill also got involved in the offense in a loss last week to Holy Cross, converting a fourth-and-3 near midfield with a 26-yard run off a fake punt. It was the first carry of his career.\n\nRUNNING THE TABLE\n\nArmy leads the series with Lafayette 18-1 and has won 17 straight. The lone victory by the Leopards came during the 1940 season, a 19-0 triumph at Michie Stadium, site of every game in the series. Army won the first game between the schools, 36-0 in 1893.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "Florida tight end C'yontai Lewis (80) is stopped for a loss by Missouri defensive linemen Walter Palmore (99) and Chris Turner (39) after catching a pass during the second half of an NCAA college football game Saturday, Nov. 3, 2018, in Gainesville, Fla.

(AP) \u2014 Missouri had been lacking a signature win in quarterback Drew Lock\u2019s final season, losing late on the road against South Carolina and two weeks ago to Kentucky.\n\nThe moment finally came last week on the road against No. 11 Florida, when the Tigers seemed to put everything together for the first time in a 38-17 rout \u2014 coach Barry Odom\u2019s first win over a ranked team.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to be faced with adversity. You\u2019re going to be faced with hard times,\u201d Odom said afterward. \u201cThis game was decided long before the ball was kicked off.\u201d\n\nThe Tigers (5-4, 1-4 SEC) hope to take the same approach into Saturday\u2019s game against Vanderbilt. Missouri can become bowl-eligible by beating the Commodores (4-5, 1-4), then build its resume with a favorable finishing stretch. The Tigers get Tennessee and Arkansas to finish out the season.\n\nVanderbilt is fighting for bowl eligibility, too. The Commodores follow their trip to Columbia with home games against Ole Miss and Tennessee.\n\n\u201cI just want one win,\u201d Vanderbilt coach Derek Mason said. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about that. We\u2019ve got to talk about today, and that\u2019s exactly what I did with my football team.\u201d\n\nSenior center Bruno Reagan knows well what happens if Vandy wins at least two of its final three.\n\n\u201cI heavily desire to play in December,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to play postseason football. I want to do a lot of things. I want to go out of here with a bowl win. That\u2019s what these seniors deserve.\u201d\n\nAfter losing three straight, the Commodores got back on track with a 45-31 win at Arkansas as Ke\u2019Shawn Vaughn ran for 172 yards and three touchdowns. He will face a Missouri defense that ranks 25th nationally and allows just 125 yards rushing per game.\n\nThe Commodores also must contain a Tigers offense that piled up 471 yards on Florida.\n\n\u201cI think this football team coached by Barry Odom is as hot of a football team, as talented of a football team as there is out there,\u201d Mason said.\n\nVETERAN QUARTERBACKS\n\nBoth guys under center \u2014 Lock for the Tigers, Kyle Shurmur for the Commodores \u2014 have started in all four years at their respective schools. Shurmur ranks third on the Commodores\u2019 career passing list with 7,772 yards. Lock has 11,089 yards and needs just 65 more to move into fifth place on the SEC\u2019s career list.\n\n\u201cI feel like (Shurmur) and I played against each other,\u201d joked Odom, who played linebacker for the Tigers from 1996-99.\n\nHALL OF A RETURN\n\nMissouri senior wide receiver Emanuel Hall took the field last week after missing four games with a groin injury and coping with the loss of his father. He caught four passes for 77 yards and a touchdown, igniting the Tigers in their blowout win over the Gators.\n\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t write that script for a guy to have his senior year,\u201d Odom said. \u201cHe\u2019s continued to stay in there and battle every day. And he\u2019s battled some off-the-field things very admirably.\u201d\n\nTHIN AT SAFETY\n\nThe Commodores could be without a pair of safeties. LaDarius Wiley\u2019s father died late last week, and Mason said the safety will rejoin the team when possible, even as late as Saturday. Zaire Jones has been suspended indefinitely for violating the student conduct policy. Mason said Jones will miss the rest of this season. Wiley has started every game this season Commodores\u2019 second leading tackler. Jones has started once and has 13 tackles.\n\nHE\u2019S EVERYWHERE\n\nVanderbilt linebacker Jordan Griffin leads the team with 46 solo tackles and 91 total tackles. The senior\u2019s total puts Griffin second in the SEC behind Arkansas\u2019 De\u2019Jon Harris, who has 93 heading into Saturday.\n\nTURNOVER-FREE\n\nEarlier in the season, Missouri couldn\u2019t avoid its own mistakes in turning the ball over.

From a skinny high school recruit who didn\u2019t play football until the eighth grade, to one of the fiercest and most disruptive pass rushers in the country, Notre Dame junior Julian Okwara has come a long way in a short period of time. (AP Photo/Steve Helber, File)\n\nSOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) \u2014 Maybe Julian Okwara read the press clippings about his lack of sacks or perhaps the Notre Dame defensive end overheard some chatter from teammate Khalid Kareem last week.\n\nHis on-field response in a 31-21 win at Northwestern suggests he had a point to prove.\n\nWith 17 quarterback hurries, 10 more than any other Irish defender, Okwara has been a pass-rushing menace for the Irish this season. Heading into the Northwestern game, Okwara had parlayed all of those hurries into only 2.5 sacks through the first eight games. Kareem, who at the time was second on the team with 4.5 sacks, didn\u2019t miss a chance for some friendly ribbing.\n\nWhen Kareem was asked if Okwara could use those quarterback hurries for bragging rights, \u201cOh no, no, no,\u201d he said with a belly laugh, \u201cthose don\u2019t count.\u201d\n\nOkwara answered the indirect challenge with 2.5 sacks against Northwestern, moving him to second on the team this season with 5.0, one-half sack ahead of Kareem.\n\n\u201cHe harasses the quarterback,\u201d Notre Dame coach Brian Kelly said of Okwara. \u201cHe gets quarterbacks uncomfortable. They move their feet. They change their launch point. Their eyes drop.\u201d\n\nOkwara also leads Notre Dame with 9.5 tackles for loss and he has an interception and a forced fumble, too.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a great player,\u201d Kareem added of Okwara. \u201cSacks, they\u2019re nice on the stat book but pressures, him deflecting balls, we\u2019ll take whatever he gives us.\u201d\n\nAnd what Okwara has given the No. 3 Irish (9-0) as they prepare for a home game Saturday against Florida State (4-5) is pure production\n\n\u201cHis ceiling is not tapped,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cHe\u2019s a guy that with another year, puts on some weight, he\u2019s a guy that can do some great things.\u201d\n\nUndersized upon his arrival on campus in 2016, Okwara joined the Irish as a skinny, 6-foot-5, 215-pound freshman.

Romeo Okwara, who led the Irish in 2015 with nine sacks, was a heavy and strong player, a powerful edge rusher.\n\nHis younger brother takes a more finesse approach, which provides the Irish coaches the rare luxury of dropping one of their best pass rushers into pass coverage when needed.\n\n\u201cNobody throws my way anymore, so I don\u2019t know,\u201d joked Julian Okwara, who has two career interceptions, including one this season against Michigan. \u201cI think they\u2019re kind of scared.\u201d\n\nAs with most sibling rivalries, Romeo Okwara suggests anything little bro can do older bro can do better.\n\n\u201cWe were definitely competitive athletically, but not just at sports,\u201d Romeo said. \u201cThat definitely carries over to everything we do.\u201d\n\nBoth brothers insist that when they interact by phone, text or in person, the subject of football rarely comes up, and that\u2019s by design.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to get your mind off football at times,\u201d Julian Okwara said, \u201cbecause you can get too carried away with the game, and I would honestly go crazy if I couldn\u2019t step away.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP freelance writer Bob Duff contributed from Allen Park, Michigan.", "Northwestern's Bennett Skowronek (88) makes a one-handed catch during the team's NCAA college football game against Notre Dame on Saturday, Nov. 3, 2018, in Evanston, Ill. (Michael Caterina/South Bend Tribune via AP)\n\nIOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) \u2014 Despite a 5-4 record, Northwestern holds all the cards in the Big Ten West title chase.\n\nThe underdog Wildcats will look to solidify their division position at Iowa, a team looking to rebound from back-to-back road losses and finish 2018 on a high note.\n\nNorthwestern (5-4, 5-1 Big Ten) has been surprisingly dominant in conference play, holding a one-game lead and tiebreakers over Wisconsin and Purdue. If the Wildcats go 2-1 over their final three games \u2014 a stretch that includes Minnesota and Illinois \u2014 they will clinch their first West title. Northwestern hung tough against No. 3 Notre Dame last week before falling 31-21.\n\n\u201cI liked how we came back and kept fighting and kept going. We know we\u2019re going to get a good one next week in Iowa,\u201d coach Pat Fitzgerald said.\n\nNorthwestern has been known to ruin an Iowa season more than once \u2014 most notably in 2009, when the Wildcats knocked out quarterback Ricky Stanzi and then knocked the 9-0 Hawkeyes from the ranks of the unbeaten.\n\nIowa (6-3, 3-3) would like nothing more than to repay the favor.\n\nThe Hawkeyes, 10-point favorites for Saturday\u2019s game, might be the most talented team in the division. But they\u2019ll need to win out and get a ton of help to leap from fourth to first in the division.\n\n\u201cIt really gets down to your ability to focus on what\u2019s important. It\u2019s like playing a game; when it\u2019s game time, the only thing that counts is that game,\u201d Iowa coach Kirk Ferentz said. \u201cRight now I think the teams that can focus on their preparation and keep their eyes there and then go out and compete on Saturday are the ones that give themselves a chance.\u201d\n\nSKILLED HAWKS\n\nIowa\u2019s losses, to Wisconsin, Penn State and Purdue, were all potential wins until late in the fourth quarter. While the Hawkeyes might not be clutch, they have at times been dominant. Their point differential of 11.8 is currently better than the Iowa team that went 12-2 in 2015 and the one that went 11-2 and won the Orange Bowl nine years ago. Five of Iowa\u2019s wins have been by at least 17 points.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been right there. One play in both of those games,\u201d Fitzgerald said of Iowa\u2019s back-to-back losses to the Nittany Lions and Boilermakers.\n\nSCOUTING THE CATS\n\nNorthwestern, behind quarterback Clayton Thorson, is third in the Big Ten with 264.7 yards passing per game. But the Wildcats are by far the worst rushing team in the league, with an astonishingly-low 2.6 yards per carry. Northwestern is allowing 24.4 points per game, good for 49th in the country. But perhaps the most surprising stat about the Wildcats is that they\u2019ve won nine straight against West teams and six in a row on the road in the Big Ten.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at them on tape, I think one thing is very apparent. They\u2019ve got an identity, a clear identity,\u201d Ferentz said. \u201cI think that\u2019s got to do with the longevity of coach Fitzgerald there and their staff. They\u2019re very well-coached. They know who they are.\u201d\n\nIOWA\u2019S RUN GAME\n\nThe Hawkeyes have yet to have a running back reach 100 yards and they\u2019re averaging 3.9 yards per carry. Still, the Hawkeyes are averaging 30.4 points a game.\n\n\u201cOur goal is just to move the ball and try to score points, and we\u2019ll do whatever we feel we have to do to be successful at that,\u201d Ferentz said.\n\nEXTRA POINTS\n\nFitzgerald is 7-5 against Iowa. ... The Hawkeyes rank second nationally in kickoff return average at 27.6 yards, while Northwestern\u2019s 26 penalties are the fewest in the country. ... Iowa is allowing just 18.6 points a game, second only to Michigan in the Big Ten. ... Thorson\u2019s 48 career starts ranks second behind Washington\u2019s Jake Browning among active quarterbacks.\n\nHE SAID IT\n\n\u201cThe offensive line, like I\u2019ve always said, it\u2019s like watching a concert pianist.

With a wind chill expected to be in the low 20s, expect Iowa State to make standout running back David Montgomery the focal point of its attack.\n\nBREWER\u2019S STATUS\n\nBaylor sophomore Charlie Brewer came off the bench after time spent in concussion protocol to throw two touchdowns, including the game winner, last week. He is listed as a co-starter this week along with senior Jalan McLendon.\n\n\u201cI think it all centers around their quarterback, a really talented football player,\u201d Campbell said of Brewer. \u201cI thought (that was) a really gutsy performance by him last week coming back into that game.\u201d\n\nEXTRA POINTS\n\nIowa State quarterback Brock Purdy, a true freshman, has led an offense that is averaging 36.3 points during its winning streak. He\u2019s also won Big 12 Newcomer of the Week three times. ... Baylor scored 17 unanswered points and won 45-42 on a last-second field goal in 2016, its last trip to Ames. ...

Canada faces an uncertain future, despite keeping the football team together and forging a winning record amid the chaos surrounding the program.(AP Photo/Gary Cameron, File)\n\nThe glaring numbers put everything in perspective this weekend.\n\nIndiana coach Tom Allen and Maryland interim coach Matt Canada know their teams desperately need momentum heading into the season\u2019s final month and understand how crucial the outcome of Saturday\u2019s game could be.\n\nThe winner could be bowl-bound. The loser may be relegated to a longer-than-expected offseason and both coaches know it, even if they choose to downplay the significance of how everything adds up in this game.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity for us come to out here and turn things around for our season, get a whole different feel for our program,\u201d Allen said as his Hoosiers returned to work following a bye week.\n\nNeither Allen nor Canada planned on spending November crunching probabilities. But previous results left them no choice.\n\nIndiana (4-5, 1-5 Big Ten) has lost four consecutive games and still needs two wins to become bowl-eligible with a trip to No. 4 Michigan next weekend looming. The Hoosiers haven\u2019t won at Ann Arbor since 1967, meaning their most logical path to the postseason would be winning their final two home games \u2014 against Maryland (5-4, 3-3) and bitter rival Purdue (5-4, 4-2), which could be playing for the West Division title.\n\nWith No. 8 Ohio State coming to town next week and a trip to No. 21 Penn State to close out the season, Maryland\u2019s best shot of earning that crucial sixth win appears to be winning Saturday.\n\nBut the Terrapins\u2019 only road win this season came at Mid-American Conference foe Bowling Green and all four losses have come by at least 21 points.\n\nThe implications of leading Maryland to its second bowl game in four years could add up to an even bigger reward for Canada, who has held together a team grieving from the death of offensive lineman Jordan McNair, last week\u2019s firing of coach DJ Durkin and this week\u2019s dismissal of two trainers involved in treating McNair after he collapsed during a May workout.\n\nCanada never has made it about him.\n\n\u201cWe have three games in the next 18 days, so our focus is on today,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s focused on getting ready to beat Indiana and being around each other. That\u2019s all we can do right now.\u201d\n\nTURNING POINT\n\nKeep an eye on the turnovers Saturday. Maryland leads the country with 16 interceptions and the Big Ten in turnover margin (plus-9). It is the only conference team with at least one pick in every game. Indiana, meanwhile, has a league-high 20 takeaways, including a league-leading 10 fumble recoveries. The Hoosiers also are No. 24 nationally with 10 interceptions.\n\nMOVING ON UP\n\nPeyton Ramsey\u2019s season certainly looks good on paper. He heads into this weekend with a completion percentage of 68.2, which would be the best in school history. Ramsey needs 20 completions to move into the top five on Indiana\u2019s single-season list and 23 pass attempts, 135 total yards and 377 yards passing to crack the top 10. He\u2019s already in the top 10 for TD passes in a season and needs three more to pass Antwaan Randle El and Ben Chappell for No. 7.\n\nREADY TO RUN\n\nLast week, the Terrapins played without injured running backs Ty Johnson and Jake Funk. Both hope to return this weekend. Johnson hurt his calf against Illinois on Oct. 27 and ranks third in school history with 4,158 all-purpose yards and fourth all-time in yards rushing with 2,597. Canada said he would be a game-time decision. Funk hasn\u2019t played since the opener against Texas because of a broken hand. He scored five touchdowns last year \u2014 two against Indiana \u2014 and was the named the Terrapins special teams player of the year. Canada said Funk was cleared to play last week.\n\nHOOSIER TIES\n\nCanada grew up in central Indiana, earned his degree at Indiana University in 1993 and got his coaching start with the Hoosiers as a graduate assistant in 1994 and 1995 under the late Bill Mallory. He returned in 2004 as Indiana\u2019s quarterbacks coach, spent 2005 and 2006 as the passing game coordinator and then became Bill Lynch\u2019s offensive coordinator from 2007-10. It\u2019s unclear if one of Maryland\u2019s famous alums will make the drive to Memorial Stadium. Colts coach Frank Reich is best remembered for throwing six second-half TD passes in relief to lead the Terrapins back from a 31-point deficit to beat Miami 42-40 in 1984.

More than a decade before the Nazis seized power in Germany, Albert Einstein was on the run and already fearful for his country\u2019s future, according to a newly revealed handwritten letter. (AP Photo, File)\n\nJERUSALEM (AP) \u2014 More than a decade before the Nazis seized power in Germany, Albert Einstein was on the run and already fearful for his country\u2019s future, according to a newly revealed handwritten letter.\n\nHis longtime friend and fellow Jew, German Foreign Minister Walther Rathenau, had just been assassinated by right-wing extremists and police had warned the noted physicist that his life could be in danger too.\n\nSo Einstein fled Berlin and went into hiding in northern Germany. It was during this hiatus that he penned a handwritten letter to his beloved younger sister, Maja, warning of the dangers of growing nationalism and anti-Semitism years before the Nazis ultimately rose to power, forcing Einstein to flee his native Germany for good.\n\n\u201cOut here, nobody knows where I am, and I\u2019m believed to be away on a trip,\u201d he wrote in August 1922. \u201cHere are brewing economically and politically dark times, so I\u2019m happy to be able to get away from everything.\u201d\n\nThe previously unknown letter, brought forward by an anonymous collector, is set to go on auction next week in Jerusalem with an opening asking price of $12,000.\n\nAs the most influential scientist of the 20th century, Einstein\u2019s life and writings have been thoroughly researched. The Hebrew University in Jerusalem, of which Einstein was a founder, houses the world\u2019s largest collection of Einstein material. Together with the California Institute of Technology it runs the Einstein Papers Project. Individual auctions of his personal letters have brought in substantial sums in recent years.\n\nThe 1922 letter shows he was concerned about Germany\u2019s future a full year before the Nazis even attempted their first coup \u2014 the failed Munich Beer Hall Putsch to seize power in Bavaria.\n\n\u201cThis letter reveals to us the thoughts that were running through Einstein\u2019s mind and heart at a very preliminary stage of Nazi terror,\u201d said Meron Eren, co-owner of the Kedem Auction House in Jerusalem, which obtained the letter and offered The Associated Press a glimpse before the public sale. \u201cThe relationship between Albert and Maja was very special and close, which adds another dimension to Einstein the man and greater authenticity to his writings.\u201d\n\nThe letter, which bears no return address, is presumed to have been written while he was staying in the port city of Kiel before embarking on a lengthy speaking tour across Asia.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m doing pretty well, despite all the anti-Semites among the German colleagues. I\u2019m very reclusive here, without noise and without unpleasant feelings, and am earning my money mainly independent of the state, so that I\u2019m really a free man,\u201d he wrote. \u201cYou see, I am about to become some kind of itinerant preacher. That is, firstly, pleasant and, secondly, necessary.\u201d\n\nAddressing his sister\u2019s concerns, Einstein writes: \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me, I myself don\u2019t worry either, even if it\u2019s not quite kosher, people are very upset. In Italy, it seems to be at least as bad.\u201d\n\nLater in 1922, Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics.\n\nZe\u2019ev Rosenkranz, the assistant director of the Einstein Papers Project at Caltech, said the letter wasn\u2019t the first time Einstein warned about German anti-Semitism, but it captured his state of mind at this important junction after Rathenau\u2019s killing and the \u201cinternal exile\u201d he imposed on himself shortly after it.\n\n\u201cEinstein\u2019s initial reaction was one of panic and a desire to leave Germany for good. Within a week, he had changed his mind,\u201d he said. \u201cThe letter reveals a mindset rather typical of Einstein in which he claims to be impervious to external pressures. One reason may be to assuage his sister\u2019s concerns. Another is that he didn\u2019t like to admit that he was stressed about external factors.\u201d\n\nWhen the Nazis came to power and began enacting legislation against Jews, they also aimed to purge Jewish scientists. The Nazis dismissed Einstein\u2019s groundbreaking work, including his Law of Relativity, as \u201cJewish Physics.\u201d\n\nEinstein renounced his German citizenship in 1933 after Hitler became chancellor. The physicist settled in the United States, where he would remain until his death in 1955.\n\nEinstein declined an invitation to serve as the first president of the newly established state of Israel but left behind his literary estate and personal papers to the Hebrew University.\n\n___\n\nFollow Aron Heller at www.twitter.com/aronhellerap", "Carolina Panthers wide receiver Curtis Samuel (10) fumbles the ball after being hit by Pittsburgh Steelers fullback Roosevelt Nix-Jones (45) on a kickoff return during the second half of an NFL football game in Pittsburgh, Thursday, Nov. 8, 2018.

We just got outplayed today.\u201d\n\nNewton\u2019s showdown with Roethlisberger also never materialized.\n\nRoethlisberger finished 22 of 25 passes for 328 yards with five touchdowns and a perfect 158.3 passer rating. The Steelers, who punted for the first time with 9:34 to play, were 8 of 9 on third down with Roethlisberger in the game.\n\nNewton completed 23 of 29 passes for 193 yards and a pair of flips to Christian McCaffrey that the second-year running back turned into scores.\n\nThe Steelers sacked Newton five times and rarely let him get comfortable as the Panthers\u2019 offensive line struggled against the pass rush. Entering Thursday\u2019s game, Carolina allowed just 12 sacks, second-fewest through eight games in franchise history.\n\nThe biggest rush came on the 11th snap of the game when Newton threw off his back foot out of the Carolina end zone while trying to avoid getting sacked. Pittsburgh linebacker Vince Williams raced under the floater and returned it 17 yards for a touchdown to give the Steelers a 14-7 lead they never came close to relinquishing.\n\n\u201cI was just trying to throw the ball away,\u201d Newton said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re getting slung around, you can\u2019t really control the accuracy. I hit the ground, I looked up and it was an interception.\u201d\n\nThe Panthers scored 99 points in their last nine quarters entering Thursday\u2019s game. That included a franchise-record 35 first-half point outburst during a 14-point win against Tampa Bay last week.\n\nMCaffrey finished with 138 yards of total offense and accounted for all three Carolina scores, but it wasn\u2019t nearly enough.\n\n\u201cThis league is hard, this league will humble you real fast,\u201d Carolina TE Greg Olsen said. \u201cHopefully, that\u2019s the lesson we get out of tonight. We\u2019ve got a lot of work to do. We found out tonight that we have some work to do to be in that upper echelon right now.\u201d\n\nThe Steelers\u2019 52 points are tied for the most ever allowed by the Panthers in franchise history. The last time it happened came during a 52-9 loss, Dec. 24, 2000, against Oakland.\n\nThe Steelers, who scored on seven of their first eight drives, held a 17-point halftime lead and increased the advantage to 38-14 on the opening series of the second half.\n\nRoethlisberger\u2019s fourth touchdown pass came two plays after Carolina safety Eric Reid was ejected for an unnecessary hit to the head while Roethlisberger slid for a first down.\n\n\u201cIt was a bang-bang play,\u201d Reid said. \u201cHe was scrambling and I\u2019m trying to do my job and tackle the person carrying the ball. I understand the NFL is trying to protect quarterbacks, but when they\u2019re running the ball they\u2019re running backs.\u201d\n\nThe hit sparked a brief fracas with members of the Steelers\u2019 offensive line, but ended with Roethlisberger and Reid sharing a fist bump and a tap on the helmet after the play.\n\n\u201cI told him that I didn\u2019t intend to hurt him by any means,\u201d Reid said. \u201cI was just trying to do my job, and he said \u201cno hard feelings.\u201d\n\nThe Panthers plan to take the extended weekend to regroup for a road game at Detroit on Nov. 18. Carolina is 6-2 all-time against Detroit.\n\n\u201cWhen you get put behind the eight ball that kind of deters you from the given game plan,\u201d Newton said. \u201cThe guys in the locker room seem to have a grasp on what\u2019s at stake. We know we\u2019re capable of being a deep contender playoff team.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "CORRECTS FROM SEN.-ELECT TO CANDIDATE- U.S. Senate candidate Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., speaks to a supporter at the Barton Barr Central Library, Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2018, in Phoenix.

Arizona\u2019s 15 counties now have until Nov. 14 to address the issue, which state Elections Director Eric Spencer said likely affects less than 10,000 votes out of more than 2.3 million cast statewide.\n\nThe Republican lawsuit said the state\u2019s county recorders don\u2019t follow a uniform standard for allowing voters to address problems with the signatures on their mail-in ballots, and that Maricopa and Pima counties improperly allow the fixes for up to five days after Election Day.\n\nThe lawsuit settlement in a courtroom packed with more than a dozen lawyers and a host of reporters came a day after Democrat Kyrsten Sinema jumped into a slight lead over Republican Martha McSally in the midst of the slow vote count. On Friday night, she padded her lead to about 1 percentage point of the 2 million ballots tallied. More than 350,000 remain accounted.\n\nEven as the Republican attorneys pursued a deal that would let conservative-leaning counties match signatures like the two urban ones, President Donald Trump seemed to attack the way Maricopa and Pima operated on twitter. \u201cIn Arizona, SIGNATURES DON\u2019T MATCH,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cElectoral corruption - Call for a new Election?\u201d\n\nFour local Republican parties filed the lawsuit Wednesday night challenging the two large counties\u2019 practice of reaching out to voters after Election Day. If the signature on the voter registration doesn\u2019t match that on the sealed envelope, both Maricopa and Pima County allow voters to help them fix, or \u201ccure\u201d it, up to five days after Election Day.\n\nMany other counties only allow voters to cure until polls close on Election Day. Now, all will follow the standard set by Maricopa, Pima and two other rural counties that allow for post-Election Day cures.\n\nA Maricopa County official said Thursday that only about 5,600 ballots were affected in her county and the rate is similar in the 14 smaller counties. Spencer said that means less than 10,000 in all.\n\nThe bottom line for Republicans was to ensure that counties with high GOP registration had a change to balance those with high or close Democratic support.\n\n\u201cThis is a really great day for us,\u201d state GOP attorney Kory Langhofer said. \u201cThe rural counties who were not going to be counting Republican votes on the same terms as the Democratic counties, they got caught with their pants down. When they\u2019ve got to show up in court and explain to the judge what they\u2019re doing they gave us everything we were asking for.\u201d\n\nGrant Woods, a former Republican state attorney general who now backs Sinema, criticized the Republicans for \u201cmonkeying with the process\u201d now that their candidate is behind in the vote.\n\n\u201cIf they lose the race they should just take their lumps and field a better candidate next time,\u2032 he said.\n\nThe political overtones of the lawsuit were unmistakable. On Thursday, Sinema jumped into a minuscule lead of about 9,000 out of 1.9 million votes counted after trailing since Tuesday. Her lead came from the two counties singled out by Republicans in their lawsuit, Maricopa and Pima Counties.\n\nOn Friday, Republicans escalated their attacks on Democrats, claiming they were trying to disenfranchise rural voters - even though Democrats had little do with how the rural counties chose to count ballots. Those counties are predominantly run by Republicans. Democrats, in turn, said the GOP was trying to nullify cast ballots.\n\nThe race remained too close to call Friday with more than 400,000 ballots still uncounted. Maricopa County Recorder Adrian Fontes said counting may continue until Nov. 15. \u201cWe know there\u2019s urgency out there, but we want to get it right, not quick,\u201d he said.\n\nArizona is notoriously slow at tallying ballots even though about 75 percent of votes are cast by mail. Each of those ballots must go through a laborious verification process.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show there at 15 Arizona counties, not 14.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "THOUSAND OAKS, Calif.

He was part of the infantry, responsible for hauling and shooting machine guns.\n\nDuring his service, Long\u2019s marriage fell apart. He and his wife separated in June 2011, while he was deployed on a seven-month tour in Afghanistan. The couple cited irreconcilable differences in divorce papers filed in May 2013, two months after Long left the Marines.\n\nLater, he enrolled at nearby California State University, Northridge, last attending in 2016, the school said in a statement.\n\nMore recently he was living in a home where neighbors said they could hear frequent, aggressive shouting between Long and his mother, especially over the last year.\n\nAbout 18 months ago, Don and Effie MacLeod heard \u201can awful argument\u201d and what he believes was a gunshot from the Longs\u2019 property.

(AP Photo/Ted S. Warren)\n\nSEATTLE (AP) \u2014 The first bit of celebrating by the Portland Timbers was premature. The confusing MLS playoff rules created a moment of misunderstanding at the end of extra time and a wild 120 minutes.\n\nThe second celebration, after Dairon Asprilla deposited his winning penalty past Seattle Sounders goalkeeper Stefan Frei, was pure elation for the Timbers as they advanced to the Western Conference finals and ended the season for their Cascadia rivals to the north.\n\n\u201cI thought it didn\u2019t disappoint. Seattle and Portland brought the rivalry to this match and it was incredible,\u201d Timbers coach Giovanni Savarese said.\n\nAsprilla\u2019s kick sent the Timbers past Seattle 4-2 in a penalty shootout Thursday night after an emotionally exhausting second half and extra time that saw the teams combine for five goals and wild swings of elation and desperation.\n\nSeattle won the second leg of the semifinal matchup 3-2, scoring late in regulation to force extra time before both teams scored early in the extra session. Eventually, the sides decided the winner via penalties, although Portland initially believed it had won at the end of extra time after scoring a second road goal in the match.\n\nThe Timbers claimed the celebration at the end of extra time was due to pride and exhaustion for taking the match to penalties. It ultimately didn\u2019t matter because the Timbers finished the job in the shootout.\n\nAsprilla, Lucas Melano, Diego Valeri and Sebastian Blanco scored penalties for Portland. Seattle\u2019s goals came from Raul Ruidiaz and Handwalla Bwana, but Will Bruin hit the post and Osvaldo Alonso\u2019s shot was saved by Portland goalkeeper Jeff Attinella, atoning for an earlier mistake that led to Seattle\u2019s first goal.\n\n\u201cBeing a goalkeeper, you have to shake that off because you always know another one is coming,\u201d Attinella said. \u201cAll the credit to the guys \u2014 they responded so well for me. I\u2019m just very grateful for the way it turned out.\u201d\n\nPortland will face Sporting Kansas City or Real Salt Lake in the West finals. It\u2019s the Timbers\u2019 first trip to the conference finals since winning the MLS Cup in 2015.\n\n\u201cThe end result was not good. But certainly, there were moments of joy and euphoria, happiness. Thinking you had the game in control,\u201d Seattle coach Brian Schmetzer said. \u201cAnd then that gets snatched out away from you.\u201d\n\nPortland held a 2-1 lead after the first leg at home and the match reached penalties only because of a wild final 25 minutes of regulation and a beginning to extra time that was equally crazy.\n\nSeattle took a 1-0 lead in the match and pulled even at 2-2 on aggregate \u2014 with the road goal tiebreaker \u2014 when Ruidiaz scored in the 68th minute after Attinella mishandled a cross into the penalty area. Less than 10 minutes later, Blanco scored to put the Timbers ahead 3-2 on aggregate and even in the match at 1-all.\n\nIt appeared that would be enough for the Timbers to advance, but Ruidiaz had another special moment waiting. With Seattle frantically scrambling for one more goal that would take the match to extra time, Ruidiaz scored in the third minute of stoppage time. The goal was created by Blanco\u2019s mistake, sending a header to the middle of the penalty area rather than away from danger. Ruidiaz hit the volley flush and set off another wild celebration.\n\nOnce the match reached extra time, road goals were no longer a tiebreaker and the rule proved to make a difference. Portland went ahead 4-3 on aggregate when Asprilla scored in the 93rd minute on a perfect cross from Valeri. That lead lasted all of four minutes after Blanco made his second major mistake late in the match, getting called for a clear handball in the penalty area. Nicolas Lodeiro confidently beat Attinella on the penalty kick and the sides were even at 4.\n\nSeattle had a goal by Ruidiaz disallowed in the 113th minute for a clear handball that bounced past Attinella and into the net.\n\nSeattle played without standout midfielder Cristian Roldan and center back Chad Marshall. Roldan strained a hip flexor in the first leg and was considered a game-time decision but was not included among Seattle\u2019s starters or subs. Marshall tore the meniscus in his right knee and underwent surgery earlier this week.\n\n\u201cWe showed a lot of heart; just that we care. We didn\u2019t give up and that\u2019s been a trademark of this team,\u201d Frei said. \u201cSomebody has to win.

The official would not give additional details on what the 28-year-old former Marine posted on his Facebook and Instagram accounts.\n\nA second law enforcement official said that when Long was inside the bar, he apparently stopped shooting and posted to Instagram, based on the time stamps of the posts.

But a mental health specialist who assessed Long after sheriff\u2019s deputies responded to a call about his agitated behavior last spring worried he might be suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nThe incident happened in April, when yelling and loud banging noises coming from the home Long shared with his mother prompted a next-door neighbor to call authorities. The mental health specialist concluded there were no grounds to have him involuntarily committed.\n\nSeveral people who knew Long a decade ago as a high-schooler in the suburb of Thousand Oaks said in interviews that he made them uncomfortable, sometimes through aggressive behavior.\n\nAt the White House, Trump touted his efforts to fund work on PTSD among veterans. He declined to engage on questions on whether the nation needs stricter gun control laws.\n\nThe dead in the shooting rampage included sheriff\u2019s Sgt. Ron Helus, a 29-year veteran gunned down as he entered the bar, and Telemachus Orfanos, 27, who survived last year\u2019s massacre in Las Vegas, where a gunman in a high-rise hotel opened killed 58 people at an outdoor country music festival.\n\nAuthorities in Thousand Oaks described an attack of military efficiency. None of those injured was hurt by gunfire, authorities said. Instead, when Long shot, he killed.\n\n\u201cEvery Marine is trained in urban warfare and indoor gun fighting,\u201d said Marc Bender, an instructor for emergency responders in Riverside County, California. \u201cEvery Marine is a marksman.\u201d\n\nJulie Hanson, who lives next door to the Longs\u2019 ranch-style home, described him as \u201codd\u201d and \u201cdisrespectful\u201d well before he left home a decade ago, got married and enlisted in the Marines.

In another, he grabbed her rear and midsection after she refused to return a cellphone he said was his.\n\n\u201cI literally feared for myself around him,\u201d Colell said in an interview. \u201cHe was the only athlete that I was scared of.\u201d\n\nColell said she wanted to kick Long off the team but the boy\u2019s coach urged her to reconsider because that could compromise his goal of joining the Marines.

Nine people died in what quickly grew into the state\u2019s most destructive fire in at least a century.\n\nOnly a day after it began, the blaze near the town of Paradise had grown to nearly 140 square miles (362 square kilometers), had destroyed more than 6,700 structures \u2014 almost all of them homes \u2014 and was burning completely out of control.\n\n\u201cThere was really no firefight involved,\u201d Capt. Scott McLean of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said, explaining that crews gave up attacking the flames and instead helped people get out alive. \u201cThese firefighters were in the rescue mode all day yesterday.\u201d\n\nWith fires also burning in Southern California , state officials put the total number of people forced from their homes at about 250,000. Evacuation orders included the entire city of Malibu, which is home to 13,000, among them some of Hollywood\u2019s biggest stars.\n\nResidents of Paradise, California, forced to evacuate due to a wildfire are learning that many homes and businesses were destroyed. Firefighters say flames moved so fast there was nothing they could do. (Nov. 9)\n\nPresident Donald Trump issued an emergency declaration providing federal funds for Butte, Ventura and Los Angeles counties.\n\nWhen Paradise was evacuated, the order set off a desperate exodus in which many motorists got stuck in gridlocked traffic and abandoned their vehicles to flee on foot. People reported seeing much of the community go up in flames, including homes, supermarkets, businesses, restaurants, schools and a retirement center.\n\nRural areas fared little better. Many homes have propane tanks that were exploding amid the flames. \u201cThey were going off like bombs,\u201d said Karen Auday, who escaped to a nearby town.\n\nMcLean estimated that the lost buildings numbered in the thousands in Paradise, about 180 miles (290 kilometers) northeast of San Francisco.\n\n\u201cPretty much the community of Paradise is destroyed. It\u2019s that kind of devastation,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile the cause of the fire wasn\u2019t known, Pacific Gas & Electric Company told state regulators it experienced an outage on an electrical transmission line near Paradise about 15 minutes before the blaze broke out. The company said it later noticed damage to a transmission tower near the town. The utility\u2019s filing was first reported by KQED News.\n\nThe massive blaze spread north Friday, prompting officials to order the evacuation of Stirling City and Inskip, two communities north of Paradise along the Sierra Nevada foothills.\n\nThe wind-driven flames also spread to the west and reached Chico, a city of 90,000 people. Firefighters were able to stop the fire at the edge of the city, Cal Fire Cpt. Bill Murphy said.\n\nThere were no signs of life Friday on the road to Paradise except for the occasional bird chirp. A thick, yellow haze from the fire hung in the air and gave the appearance of twilight in the middle of the day.\n\nStrong winds had blown the blackened needles on some evergreens straight to one side. A scorched car with its doors open sat on the shoulder.\n\nAt one burned-out house, flames still smoldered inside what appeared to be a weight room. The rubble included a pair of dumbbells with the rubber melted off and the skeletons of a metal pullup bar and other exercise equipment. The grass and elaborate landscaping all around the brick and stucco home remained an emerald green. Red pool umbrellas were furled near lounge chairs and showed not a singe on them.\n\nEvacuees from Paradise sat in stunned silence Friday outside a Chico church where they took refuge the night before. They all had harrowing tales of a slow-motion escape from a fire so close they could feel the heat inside their vehicles as they sat stuck in a terrifying traffic jam.\n\nWhen the order came to evacuate, it was like the entire town of 27,000 residents decided to leave at once, they said. Fire surrounded the evacuation route, and drivers panicked. Some crashed and others left their vehicles by the roadside.\n\n\u201cIt was just a wall of fire on each side of us, and we could hardly see the road in front of us,\u201d police officer Mark Bass said.\n\nOfficials said all the victims were found in Paradise, including four who died inside their vehicles.\n\nA nurse called Rita Miller on Thursday morning, telling her she had to get her disabled mother, who lives a few blocks away, and flee Paradise immediately. Miller jumped in her boyfriend\u2019s rickety pickup truck, which was low on gas and equipped with a bad transmission. She instantly found herself stuck in gridlock.\n\n\u201cI was frantic,\u201d she said. After an hour of no movement, she abandoned the truck and decided to try her luck on foot. While walking, a stranger in the traffic jam rolled down her window and asked Miller if she needed help. Miller at first scoffed at the notion of getting back in a vehicle. Then she reconsidered, thinking: \u201cI\u2019m really scared. This is terrifying. I can\u2019t breathe. I can\u2019t see, and maybe I should humble myself and get in this woman\u2019s car.\u201d\n\nThe stranger helped Miller pack up her mother and took them to safety in Chico. It took three hours to travel the 14 miles.\n\nConcerned friends and family posted anxious messages on Twitter and other sites, saying they were looking for loved ones, particularly seniors who lived at retirement homes or alone.\n\nAbout 20 of the same deputies who were helping to find and rescue people lost their own homes, Sheriff Kory Honea said.\n\n\u201cThere are times when you have such rapid-moving fires ... no amount of planning is going to result in a perfect scenario, and that\u2019s what we had to deal with here,\u201d Honea told the Action News Network.\n\nKelly Lee called shelters looking for her husband\u2019s 93-year-old grandmother, Dorothy Herrera, who was last heard from Thursday morning. Herrera, who lives in Paradise with her 88-year-old husband, Lou, left a frantic voicemail around 9:30 a.m. saying they needed to get out.\n\n\u201cWe never heard from them again,\u201d Lee said. \u201cWe\u2019re worried sick. ... They do have a car, but they both are older and can be confused at times.\u201d\n\nFor one desperate day, Dawn Johnson anxiously waited for news of her father Richard Wayne Wilson and his wife, Suzanne, who lived in an RV park in Paradise that burned. The couple moved from Texas to the California foothill town about a year ago and was probably not prepared for wildfires.\n\nThey lived in an RV park in the California foothill town and were unlikely equipped to evacuate. He has late-stage cancer and she is mostly confined to her bed, she said.\n\nJohnson, of Independence, Oregon, relied on fellow members of the couple\u2019s Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses congregation to check local shelters. By Friday afternoon, she learned they had been found in nearby Chico.\n\n\u201cThey are fine,\u201d she said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Paul Elias in Paradise and Jocelyn Gecker, Janie Har, Daisy Nguyen, Olga R.

Nor must it lead to conflict,\u201d Mattis said.\n\nAlthough the rescheduling of the dialogue signaled an effort by the two sides to contain the slide in the relationship, it did not address the core dispute on trade. Trump has slapped tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese products, in a push to narrow the U.S. trade deficit and push back against what the U.S. views as predatory Chinese tactics on the high technology industry. Beijing has retaliated with tariffs on $110 million worth of U.S. goods.\n\nYun Sun, a China expert at the Stimson Center think tank, said Beijing is uncertain about what exactly Trump wants out of a trade deal, but hopes that with U.S. midterm elections out of the way, the mercurial American president may be more inclined to reach a compromise. \u201cTheir top priority is to stabilize relations,\u201d she said.\n\nOn human rights, Pompeo voiced concern over China\u2019s treatment of religious minorities, including the mass detention of minority Uighur Muslims.

It\u2019s a sign of potentially big changes for Medicare. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Medicare is experimenting with a new direction in health care. Starting next year, seniors in many states will be able to get additional services such as help with chores and respite for caregivers through private Medicare Advantage insurance plans.\n\nThere\u2019s a growing recognition that such practical help can have a meaningful impact on patients\u2019 well-being \u2014 and reduce some costs for taxpayers. A couple of hundred dollars to install grab bars in the shower can prevent a fall leading to a broken hip, a life-changing injury.\n\nThat may also help elderly people stay in their homes longer.\n\nThe newly covered services are similar to what people might need if they required long-term care, said Howard Gleckman, a senior researcher at the nonpartisan Urban Institute think tank.\n\n\u201cIt begins to break down the wall between long-term care and Medicare, which, with very few exceptions, has never paid for long-term care,\u201d Gleckman said.\n\nChange is starting slowly. Policymakers have yet to figure out how to bring similar benefits to traditional Medicare, still the choice of 2 out of 3 seniors.\n\nThe new services will be offered by some Medicare Advantage plans in more than 20 states next year, and that\u2019s expected to grow over time.\n\nThere has to be a health-related reason to qualify, and costs will vary among plans. In some plans, there\u2019s no added cost. But limits do apply. For example, a plan may cover one day per week at an adult day care center.\n\nNearly 23 million Medicare beneficiaries, or more than 1 in 3, are expected to be covered by a Medicare Advantage plan next year. The private plans generally offer lower out-of-pocket costs in exchange for limits on choice of doctors and hospitals and other restrictions such as prior authorization for services. It\u2019s a growing business for insurers.\n\nMedicare Advantage open enrollment for 2019 ends Dec. 7. But it\u2019s not easy to use Medicare\u2019s online plan finder to search for plans with expanded benefits, so beneficiaries and their families will have to rely on promotional materials that insurers mail during open enrollment.\n\nFor years, Medicare has permitted private plans to offer supplemental benefits not covered by the traditional program. Think free gym memberships, transportation to medical appointments or home-delivered meals following a hospitalization.\n\nThe new benefits take that to a higher level, with Medicare\u2019s blessing.\n\n\u201cIt is a big concept, in the sense that it is officially encouraging plans to get across the line into the many, many things that affect the health and well-being of beneficiaries,\u201d said Marc Russo, president of insurer Anthem\u2019s Medicare business. \u201cI, for one, who have been in and around Medicare for decades, believe it pays.\u201d\n\nInsurers under Anthem\u2019s corporate umbrella are offering different packages in 12 of 21 states where they operate Medicare plans. They can include alternative medicine, like acupuncture, or adult day care center visits or a personal helper at home.\n\nOther major insurers like UnitedHealthcare and Humana are participating. It\u2019s a calculated gamble for insurers, who still have to make a profit.\n\nAnd the limited new benefits are no substitute for full long-term care coverage, which many people need for at least part of their lives and remains prohibitively expensive. Seniors trying to get long-term care through Medicaid, the program for low-income people, must spend down their life savings.\n\n\u201cMedicare policy has not kept up with the times,\u201d said Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., one of the authors of bipartisan legislation seen as a catalyst for expanded services through Medicare Advantage.\n\nWyden said he\u2019s working to bring similar options to traditional Medicare.\n\n\u201cClearly this is going to have to be an effort that is going to have to be built out,\u201d he added.\n\nThe changes represent a rare consensus at a time when health care issues are among the most politically divisive. Republican and Democratic lawmakers, as well as Seema Verma, the Trump administration\u2019s Medicare chief, are pulling in the same direction.\n\nThe idea of broader services through Medicare Advantage was embodied in a bipartisan Senate Finance Committee bill to improve care for chronically ill seniors. The Trump administration issued regulations in the spring trying to accelerate the changes.\n\nAccording to Medicare, 12 insurers will be offering expanded supplemental benefits next year through 160 plans in 20 states. In four other states and Puerto Rico, such benefits may be available to seniors with certain health conditions.\n\n\u201cThe guidance came out fairly late in the annual planning process, and that\u2019s one reason why some of these benefits may start out small,\u201d said Steve Warner, head of Medicare Advantage program development for UnitedHealthcare.\n\nMedicare estimates that some 780,000 beneficiaries will have access to the new benefits next year. In-home helpers and support for caregivers are the most popular.\n\nConsumer advocates recommend that seniors carefully weigh whether Medicare Advantage is best for them. If they don\u2019t like it, they can go back to traditional Medicare, but those with a pre-existing condition may not be able to buy a Medigap policy to help cover out-of-pocket costs. They can also switch to another Medicare Advantage plan.\n\nMedicare doesn\u2019t pay the insurers more for offering added benefits. Under a complex formula, they\u2019re primarily financed out of the difference between bids submitted by insurers and Medicare\u2019s maximum payment to plans. If the companies bid below Medicare\u2019s rate, they can return some of that to beneficiaries in the form of added benefits.", "1 of 7 Golden State Warriors' Stephen Curry drives the ball past Milwaukee Bucks' Eric Bledsoe (6) during the first half of an NBA basketball game Thursday, Nov. 8, 2018, in Oakland, Calif.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Getting President Donald Trump\u2019s tax returns is high on the list of Democratic priorities now that they have won the House.\n\nBy law, the leaders of tax-writing committees in the House and Senate can obtain tax returns and related information from the Internal Revenue Service. Democrats will control the House panel next year.\n\nYet there\u2019s no guarantee that the Trump administration will provide the president\u2019s returns. That sets up the possibility of a legal battle over the request that could take years to resolve.\n\nTrump broke with political tradition in 2016 by refusing to release his income tax filings. He says he won\u2019t release them because he\u2019s under audit, and he claimed at a press conference this week that the filings are too complex for people to understand.\n\nThe Democrats tried and failed several times to obtain Trump\u2019s returns as the minority party in Congress. Now, having gained some control, they see them within their grasp.\n\nEyes are on Rep. Richard Neal of Massachusetts, who is now the senior Democrat on the powerful Ways and Means Committee and will become its chairman in January.\n\nWhen asked Wednesday whether the committee under his control would ask for the documents, Neal said, \u201cYes, I think we will.\u201d\n\nIf the Trump administration refuses and mounts a legal challenge, Neal said, \u201cThen I assume that there would be a court case that would go on for a period of time.\u201d\n\nA legal fight could potentially even stretch beyond the 2020 presidential election, suggested Andy Grewal, a professor at the University of Iowa College of Law.\n\nGrewal has maintained that a request for Trump\u2019s returns, if made for \u201cpurely political purposes,\u201d may exceed the limits of Congress\u2019 authority.\n\nStarting with the 2016 campaign, Trump broke with political tradition by repeatedly refusing to release his income tax filings. Those filings are deemed sacredly secret for citizens, but traditionally not for presidents. Trump has said he hasn\u2019t released them because his taxes are under audit by the IRS \u2014 even though experts and IRS officials say such audits don\u2019t bar taxpayers from releasing their returns.\n\nAsked about releasing his filings, Trump reaffirmed that justification during a post-election news conference Wednesday. \u201cThey\u2019re under audit. They have been for a long time,\u201d the president said. \u201cThey\u2019re extremely complex. People wouldn\u2019t understand them.\u201d\n\nGiving a slight opening, Trump said that if the audit was completed, \u201cI would have an open mind to it. I would say that.\u201d But, he added, \u201cNobody turns over a return when it\u2019s under audit.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, more than a million people signed a petition to the White House urging Trump to make the returns public.\n\nQuestions loom: Was the swaggering longtime businessman and real estate mogul really worth $10 billion when he entered the White House, as he has claimed? Are there conflicts of interest lurking? How has his global panoply of properties and other assets been valued for taxation purposes? What are the sources of his income and to whom might he be beholden as a result? Does Trump stand to gain personally from the sweeping Republican tax law enacted late last year, which he championed, and, if so, how specifically?\n\nAmong the sought-after details: Trump\u2019s charitable giving, the type of deductions he claimed, how much he earned from his assets and what strategies he deployed to reduce his tax bill.\n\nHouse Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi declined during a press conference Wednesday to specifically address the question of Trump\u2019s returns, saying only that Congress has \u201ca constitutional responsibility to have oversight\u201d and citing examples such as the government\u2019s environmental policy that would be ripe for Congress to investigate.\n\nThe high interest \u2014 Democrats would say the urgency \u2014 in lifting the veil on Trump\u2019s taxes ramped up last month when The New York Times published an extensive report suggesting that the Trump family cheated the IRS for decades, undervaluing reported assets and using dubious tax maneuvers and outright fraud in some cases.\n\nA lawyer for Trump disputed the Times\u2019 findings of possible tax fraud or evasion and said that parts of the report were \u201cextremely inaccurate.\u201d The newspaper said its report was based on more than 100,000 pages of financial documents, including confidential tax returns from Trump\u2019s father and his companies.\n\nThat could spur the Democrats on the Ways and Means Committee to ask for Trump\u2019s returns going back many years.\n\nBy law, the chairmen of the House panel, the Senate Finance Committee and the Joint Committee on Taxation can make a written request for any tax returns to the Treasury Secretary, who oversees the IRS. The law says the Treasury chief \u201cshall furnish\u201d the requested information to the members of the committee for them to examine behind closed doors.\n\nThe IRS, with custody of Trump\u2019s returns, has been headed since Oct. 1 by a commissioner who worked as a private tax attorney for nearly four decades representing individuals and companies in cases before the agency. During the 2016 campaign, the commissioner, Charles Rettig, defended Trump\u2019s refusal to release his filings. He promised at his Senate confirmation hearing to uphold the IRS\u2019 political independence from the White House.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin \u201cwill review any request with the Treasury general counsel for legality,\u201d the department said in a statement Thursday.\n\nTrump\u2019s attorney Rudy Giuliani has said the Democrats could have a hard time proving their demand was intended for pursuing legitimate congressional oversight, not a political scavenger hunt.\n\nIf the administration refuses to hand over the returns, the Democrat-led committee might punch back with subpoenas, move to hold officials in contempt of Congress or sue the administration. There\u2019s no roadmap or historical precedent for the situation.\n\nSome observers anticipate that the Trump Justice Department would file a lawsuit against the House to block release of the returns. In that case, the administration might try to prove that the Democrats\u2019 demand was politically motivated, as Giuliani indicated.\n\nThe University of Iowa\u2019s Grewal is among the experts who believe the administration may seek to make that case.\n\nBut Joe Thorndike, director of the tax history project at publisher Tax Analysts, says he doubts that argument could succeed. \u201cIt\u2019s not unreasonable for a member of Congress to be concerned about the president\u2019s tax returns,\u201d he said.\n\nGeorge Yin, a professor of law and taxation at the University of Virginia who formerly was chief of staff for the Joint Committee on Taxation, asserts that Congress has the clear right to obtain and release a president\u2019s tax returns to the public without his or her consent \u2014 provided the disclosure would be in the public interest.\n\nNot so fast, says Ken Kies, another former chief of staff for the joint tax panel, who\u2019s now a tax lobbyist. \u201cI\u2019d be really uncomfortable about that,\u201d he said.\n\nThe federal tax code authorizes the lawmakers who obtain tax returns to file a detailed report on them to the full U.S. House, which essentially would put the information into the public domain. But lawmakers and committee staff could be subject to criminal penalties, including prison sentences, for unauthorized disclosure of tax material.\n\n\u201cI would never take possession of those tax returns if I were (Neal),\u201d said Janice Mays, a former chief counsel and staff director for the Ways and Means Committee who is managing director of tax policy services at consulting firm PwC. \u201cI would visit the IRS and inspect them there.\u201d", "LAWRENCE, Kan. (AP) \u2014 When Lawrence resident Sherry Gill joined the U.S. Army in 1976, she said she was willing to kill if she needed to.\n\nBut that\u2019s not how the higher command originally saw her, or any woman, contributing to the armed forces when she was placed in the Women\u2019s Army Corps. The WAC was a military unit that placed women in \u201cgender appropriate\u201d roles, according to the National Museum of the United States Army.\n\n\u201cI had to do a lot of ironing, pressing and starching of uniforms,\u201d she said. \u201cI wanted to be a soldier. I knew I could fight and kill somebody if I had to, if that was needed.\u201d\n\nGill and other women in the WAC thought the ironing and other chores they were required to do were meaningless because they all wanted to be combat soldiers, she said. Many of those women eventually got their chance because the WAC was disbanded in 1978, and Gill joined the first group of women in the Army to move over to the combat roles.\n\nShe said the women were first tested by throwing dummy grenades.\n\n\u201cThey wanted to see if we could throw,\u201d she said. \u201cWe thought that was ridiculous because we knew we could throw, were strong and they were clueless. (The Army leaders) still hadn\u2019t wrapped their head around women being soldiers.\u201d\n\nGill, who now works for the Douglas County Sheriff\u2019s Office, served in the Army from 1976 to 1979 and then in the National Guard for four years in the late 1980s and early 1990s, she said.\n\n\u201cIn the new Army, with the National Guard, we didn\u2019t do any kind of ironing,\u201d she said. \u201cI was a real soldier, and I was respected for that.\u201d\n\nGill\u2019s experiences in the armed forces, along with the experiences of seven other local women veterans, will be reflected in a Lawrence Arts Center performance, \u201cRethink: I am a Veteran,\u201d which will run during Veteran\u2019s Day weekend, the Lawrence Journal-World reported.\n\nElizabeth Sullivan, director of the show, said local actors will be performing several vignettes based on interviews with eight local veterans. Gill and Brooklynne Mosley, another veteran whose experiences will be in the show, will also perform some of their own stories. Gill said she will read from the essay she wrote, called \u201cGrenades Beat the Hell Out of Ironing.\u201d\n\nAlthough the show will portray many of the struggles the women faced in the Armed forces \u2014 be it sexual abuse, glass ceilings, toxic masculinity and other issues \u2014 Sullivan said the show also goes into the many positive aspects of the military, such as the education and camaraderie.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s this piece of society that really opened up their minds,\u201d she said. \u201cThe through line is that all of these women all definitely gained something and they would do it all over again if they could, but there are definite challenges when it comes to being in the military as a woman.\u201d\n\nLora Rimmer, a veteran from Paola who now lives in Baldwin City, said there were some difficulties during her career in the Army, but there were plenty of great aspects, as well.\n\n\u201cThere were hard times, with mortars falling or you\u2019re being deployed when kid\u2019s 10 months old,\u201d she said. \u201cThose are all really hard times, but we\u2019re not broken. So much is in the press these days about (sexual assault), so there is some really tough moments. That\u2019s true for all soldiers.\n\n\u201cBut we\u2019re not broken. We had moments of camaraderie and support of one another and family. You know you made a difference. That\u2019s the nugget that you can hold onto.\u201d\n\nRimmer joined the military service through ROTC at the University of Kansas. She also served in the National Guard.\n\nShe served several roles throughout her 28-year career, beginning as a signal officer working with communications, and ending as a military science professor to train young officers at a university in Texas.\n\nShe said the most interesting part of the show for her has been meeting the women who served in the military before her.\n\n\u201cThese are the ladies who paved the path for me,\u201d she said, and she noted that she retired in 2016 as a lieutenant colonel. \u201cThat\u2019s a higher rank than any of these ladies had. If they hadn\u2019t done and been part of the military and performed the way they obviously did, then I would have never been able to make that rank.\u201d\n\nSince retiring, Rimmer said she\u2019s noticed other women have moved further up the ranks than she had.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really awe-inspiring being in a room with these ladies and know that they came before me,\u201d she said.\n\nNancy Hope, who served in the Navy from 1976-1980 as a line officer in Puerto Rico and Japan, said her military career gave her a new perspective on the world.\n\n\u201cIt made you feel part of America,\u201d she said of her service. \u201cGrowing up, I thought I was from New Jersey, I never thought I was from America. It made you patriotic. You couldn\u2019t help but think being American was special.\u201d\n\nAfter leaving the Navy in 1980, she continued to live in Japan working as a designer for a clothing company. She eventually returned to the United States and joined the University of Kansas in 1990, serving as the associate director for the Kansas Consortium for Teaching about Asia.\n\nShe said she\u2019s excited for the show because it reflects on a part of her life that she hadn\u2019t thought about in a long time.\n\n\u201cFor many of us, we put it on a shelf and it was finished,\u201d she said. \u201cThis way allows us to reflect and share.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Lawrence (Kan.) Journal-World, http://www.ljworld.com", "JOPLIN, Mo. (AP) \u2014 During the summer of 1961, 29-year-old Olimpia Rea, heavy with child, traveled 77 miles from her home in Arpino, Italy, to Rome. Deep within a rust-colored orphanage, not far from the Colosseum, she gave birth to a healthy baby boy.\n\nFor seven days, mother and child were inseparable. But when Rea left the orphanage to return home she did so empty-handed. Her child, christened Antonio Cinzani, would be leaving Italy for the United States, where he would fall into the loving arms of Louis and Mary Louise Sachetta, of Columbus, Kansas, who would adopt him.\n\nSoon after arriving in the United States, Antonio received a new American name: Kerry Sachetta.\n\nNow an assistant superintendent for operations for Joplin Schools, Sachetta has devoted much of his life \u2014 a 57-year hunt as he\u2019s dubbed it \u2014 to putting a name and face to the woman who gave birth to him all those years ago, the Joplin Globe reported.\n\n\u201cIt all began, in a way, since I was old enough to walk. My parents told me I was adopted . as I got older, in my late 20s, I kept thinking, \u2018I wonder if there\u2019s anyone out there who looks like me?\u2019 That\u2019s all it really was. That\u2019s when (in the 1980s) . I decided it was time to search for my biological mother,\u201d Sachetta said.\n\n\u201cI wanted to meet her just once, to say hello. I wasn\u2019t really interested in replacing my (adoptive) mother or even having a two-mother type of relationship. That wasn\u2019t my goal. I\u2019ve had a great life. I\u2019m very fortunate to have been adopted. I just wanted to meet my mother. And I wanted to tell her, \u2018Thank you.\u2019\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, through an unlikely coalition of DNA and social media connections, and faded stories passed down from people he would meet, Sachetta managed, against overwhelming odds, to solve his lifelong mystery.\n\nSachetta knew nothing about his biological mother when his search began. Because his adoption had been organized by a Catholic relief agency, some paperwork supplied to the adoptive family was all he had to go on. It did not contain his mother\u2019s name, her birth date or where in Italy she was from \u2014 any one of which, Sachetta said, would have greatly helped him in his search. What he did have from that document was a sparse physical description of his biological mother: She was of medium height, in good health, with chestnut brown-colored hair and grey eyes. And that was it.\n\n\u201cI always thought that was a bit strange,\u201d Sachetta said of the lack of detailed information. There also seemed to be very few similarities between the two of them, though he noted his hair was a similar chestnut brown.\n\nNewly married in 1990, Sachetta and his wife, Amber, visited Italy during their honeymoon in March. They found themselves touring one of the most beautiful countries in Europe, he said, but he also was there to actively begin the search for his biological mother.\n\nIt was an English-speaking hotel concierge, of all people, who helped him connect with an 89-year-old woman, Jolanda Vesely Torraca, who had arranged for thousands of adoptions overseas after World War II.\n\n\u201cIn a matter of a couple hours he\u2019d called Jolanda ... for us to visit, and he plotted the rest of the destinations on a map for us \u2014 the address of the church of my baptism, the address of the orphanage, my original birth certificate in a ledger-type book at City Hall offices,\u201d Sachetta said.\n\nTorraca, he discovered during his talk with her, was a well-known and respected philanthropist who had helped women and refugee children during and after the war. She also had started the orphanage where his biological mother had left him after those seven days. Torraca had even studied the American adoption system and built a strong relationship with Catholic Social Services, which aided in the transportation of Italian orphans across the Atlantic. Despite not finding his mother, Sachetta said, \u201cI felt good about it. I felt like I\u2019d made a lot of headway.\u201d\n\nBut then life intervened. Professional jobs and two growing sons occupied his time. The search slowed, though Sachetta said his Italian-born biological mother was never far from mind.\n\nFor as long as he lives, Sachetta will never forget the name \u2014 John Campitelli. He was another of those strangers who out of nowhere aided his search.\n\n\u201cThis guy is awesome,\u201d Sachetta said of his friend. \u201cHe is just an unbelievable guy.\u201d\n\nCampitelli, much like Sachetta, was born in Italy and adopted out to American parents. He also yearned to find his biological mother. Campitelli took the search one step further, however, by moving back to Italy. There, he succeeded in finding, and befriending his own biological mother. The results were so rewarding he decided to help other Americans connect with long-lost Italian family members. Sachetta, in 2013, was put in touch with Campitelli through a friend, and Sachetta\u2019s search would be one of many Campitelli personally took under his wing.\n\nCampitelli told Sachetta to start with a DNA test with a genetic genealogy website, and Sachetta chose Ancestry.com.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know what I was doing,\u201d Sachetta said, chuckling at the memory. \u201cI spat in a tube and sent it off.\u201d\n\nThe results, when they were posted on the website, were discouraging.\n\n\u201cThere were no matches,\u201d Sachetta said. \u201cJust nobody. Like no first cousins, no close relatives. The closest relative that I was matched to was something like a fourth cousin, and that\u2019s way down the line.\u201d\n\nCampitelli suggested he use another genealogy website, GEDMatch.com.\n\nWhen those results were posted, Sachetta\u2019s top match was a woman by the name of Cassandra VanAmburg. The website pegged her as Sachetta\u2019s third cousin.\n\n\u201cI had to look up to see what a third cousin was,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what that meant. I knew about first and second cousins, but what the heck was a third cousin?\u201d\n\nA very distant relative, it turns out. Sachetta and the woman shared a centimorgan count of between 80 and 90, which was less than 1 percent shared DNA between the two of them. In genetics, a centimorgan is a unit for measuring genetic linkage. To put that number in perspective, the centimorgan count shared by Sachetta and his own son, Gabe, is 3,439.\n\nAfter some hesitation, Sachetta reached out to VanAmburg, emailing her about his search for his biological mother.\n\nAnd then, Sachetta said, a \u201cmiracle\u201d happened. VanAmburg quickly responded, telling him about how her father had told her a story, long ago, about \u201csomeone in the family\u201d possibly going to Rome to give up an infant child. She said that woman had been from Arpino, Italy. Reading this, Sachetta said he got excited.\n\nCould it be?\n\nSachetta next connected with VanAmburg\u2019s father, and after comparing notes, they discovered they were one generation off. The woman they\u2019d been discussing was not Sachetta\u2019s mother.\n\nSachetta had done all he could up to this point. He would now need others \u2014 complete strangers \u2014 to take their own DNA tests in order to create more useful matches that he could follow. The waiting was the worst part, he admitted, \u201cbecause somebody has to take DNA tests and you\u2019re just hoping they do that.\u201d\n\nHe and his wife checked Ancestry.com and other sites daily.\n\nIn the summer of 2017, he discovered a new name at the top of his DNA list \u2014 Tina Hudson (92 centimorgans), another third cousin.\n\nAgain, he fired off a greeting and information about his search. Her reply? \u201cI think my mom may know something about this story.\u201d\n\nAfter speaking to Hudson\u2019s mother, Susan Rea-Iafrate, he discovered both Hudson and VanAmburg were first cousins.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re kidding me,\u201d Sachetta remembers saying, his jaw dropping. The two women\u2019s fathers were brothers.\n\n\u201cSo I had contacted two third cousins that were related to one another and a year apart,\u201d he said with a shake of his head. \u201cAt this point I felt like I was getting close. I was getting there. Somehow, I\u2019m in the ballpark.\u201d\n\nDuring ongoing discussions with Rea-Iafrate, he was put in touch with another relative, Franco Paolozzi, who lived in Pennsylvania. Simultaneously, Paolozzi was calling his relatives in Italy, telling his aunts and uncles about this strange man from Missouri who was wondering if he was a long lost family member. The more they talked, the more some of the aunts and uncles recalled long-ago details about a sister \u2014 Antonia Rea \u2014 heading off to Rome in the early 1960s to have a child. Could all of this be true, they asked themselves. Could this American be Antonia\u2019s lost son? Paolozzi decided to take a DNA test to find out.\n\n\u201cHis willingness to take a DNA test ... was critical,\u201d Sachetta said of Paolozzi. \u201cOnce his DNA verified the closeness of our relationship (cousins), we knew I was in the right family.\u201d\n\nIt also happened that Antonia\u2019s son, Nunzio Magliocco, was living in Ireland.\n\nOn Christmas Eve 2017, Sachetta picked up the phone and called Magliocco.\n\n\u201cHey, I think you may be my brother,\u201d he told the man.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Magliocco immediately answered. \u201cI heard this story from one of my aunts one time that maybe my mother had a child after me. But I thought they were messing around with me.\u201d\n\nA pause.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Magliocco said. \u201cThis could be true.\u201d\n\nHe would have to take a DNA test to prove it.\n\n\u201cBy this time everything is going great guns,\u201d Sachetta said. \u201cNunzio and I had become Facebook friends ... treating each other like brothers. My kids became friends with his kids, everybody was talking.\u201d\n\nTwo months later, Sachetta was watching television upstairs when Amber excitedly called his name. On his Ancestry.com page, Magliocco\u2019s DNA results had been posted, listing him third \u2014 right beneath Sachetta\u2019s two sons, Gabe and Luke \u2014 with a centimorgan count that had risen to the low thousands.\n\nBut Sachetta\u2019s heart sank. Ancestry.com listed Magliocco as a first cousin, not a brother. Soon after, he discovered the woman he thought might be his biological mother, Antonia, was actually his aunt, and that the woman had died three years earlier.\n\n\u201cThat is when I knew we just had to keep getting cousins to take DNA tests to narrow it down,\u201d Sachetta said, adding, \u201cI never thought about stopping. I couldn\u2019t stop. I was so far in.\u201d\n\nIn March, Sachetta received phone calls from two men, Roberto and Santino Rea, half brothers, both claiming to be Sachetta\u2019s first cousins. Both lived in Ireland, like Magliocco, having immigrated there from Italy decades earlier.\n\nSachetta couldn\u2019t quite believe his luck. He\u2019d launched his search with little to go on, but now he\u2019d befriended two third cousins and three first cousins, and a slew of aunts and uncles.\n\n\u201cIt was just wonderful,\u201d he said.\n\nThe two half brothers got right to the point: They wanted to help Sachetta track down his mother. To help him do that, they and another cousin, Fabio, would each take DNA tests with Ancestry.com. By doing this, they could whittle down the 11 aunts to determine if one might be Sachetta\u2019s biological mother. They also emailed him birth dates of these aunts and uncles.\n\nMeanwhile, Campitelli was hard at work trying to track down any additional documentation that might list Sachetta\u2019s biological mother\u2019s birth date. At one point, Sachetta had appealed to the Juvenile Court in Rome as well as the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops for records. He\u2019d also filed a Freedom of Information Act with the U.S. government to obtain his Alien File, which he received, though it contained nothing he didn\u2019t already have in hand.\n\n\u201cWhen I sent my records to an advocate in Rome to appeal to the Juvenile Court on my behalf, my case took almost two years to get any traction, because the judge, Vanessa Carocci, looked in Italy for my records and could not find anything,\u201d Sachetta said. \u201cUpon prompting from John Campitelli, the juvenile judge decided to write to the Italian ambassador in Washington, D.C. At that point the Italian embassy intervened in my case with the USCCB. The USCCB then indicated the local Catholic Social Services Agency should release the entire file. John\u2019s persistence paid off.\u201d\n\nBecause of that USCCB decision, Sachetta also received a phone call from the Rev. Mike Simone, a Catholic priest from Wichita, Kansas, and family friend \u2014 the two had grown up near each other. He told Sachetta that his records in Wichita would be released to him.\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean, my records?\u201d Sachetta asked him. \u201cI thought I had all of my records.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh no,\u201d Simone told him. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more.\u201d\n\nTwo days later, 150 PDF pages found their way into Sachetta\u2019s email. Filing through the pages, he came across a date: April 7, 1931.\n\n\u201cIt just shined like a diamond at me,\u201d he said of the date. \u201cIt was the day my mother was born.\u201d\n\nRifling through the birth dates of the various aunts Santino Rea had emailed him, he found a Rea woman with the identical birth date \u2014 Olimpia Rea, the oldest of the 11 Rea siblings.\n\nSachetta turned to his wife, and said: \u201cAmber, my mother\u2019s Olimpia Rea.\u201d\n\nHe immediately got on Facebook and asked Santino if that date meant anything to him.\n\n\u201cSure,\u201d Santino responded. \u201cThat\u2019s my mother\u2019s birthday.\u201d\n\nA pause.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re my brother,\u201d Santino replied.\n\nHe would later find out that he was a half brother. Olimpia Rea had had four children \u2014 Santino, Kerry Sachetta, Luciano and Roberto \u2014 from three different men. Santino and Sachetta had different fathers. Luciano and Roberto shared a third man as their father.\n\nLuciano, he learned, had been killed in an automobile accident in 1986.\n\nOlimpia died two years later, most likely of complications from diabetes. Sachetta wonders if she was distraught over the death of her son, Luciano.\n\n\u201cSo when Amber and I went to Italy in 1990 (on their honeymoon), my mother had already been deceased for two years,\u201d Sachetta said.\n\n\u201cI have no ill feelings about why Olimpia gave me up for adoption,\u201d Sachetta said. \u201cOf course I wondered why, but I have not, nor do I dwell on it. She made a decision that was best for both of us at the time. She already had another child (Santino). Obviously my biological father was not present and life was very hard for her \u2014 she could not read or write because schooling for her was nonexistent during the war years.\n\n\u201cAnd the great thing is, I was so fortunate to (have been) adopted and cared for by the great parents I have.\u201d\n\nSachetta likened his search to finding a needle in a sprawling haystack.\n\n\u201cIt really was like that, because when you start out with a third cousin, you really don\u2019t have much to run on. In a way, it\u2019s like solving a mystery. It just takes a lot of patience. And without DNA, of course, none of this would have happened. That, and stories passed down through generations. Those stories were so important.\u201d\n\nNot only had Sachetta found his mother\u2019s identity, but along the way he\u2019d also discovered two half brothers and a first cousin \u2014 Nunzio Magliocco \u2014 that he said he now treats like a third brother.\n\nOver the summer, the Sachetta family booked a trip that took them to Ireland, France and Italy. He met more than 120 relatives during four celebrations that he said felt like family homecomings \u2014 one joyous occasion after another.\n\n\u201cThey just treated us way better than we deserved to be,\u201d he said of his extended family. \u201cI was just happy to meet them when I did and to have the time we have left to spend together.\u201d\n\nSachetta is working now to get his original birth certificate in Italy changed from Antonio Cinzani to Kerry Sachetta, so he can apply for Italian citizenship.\n\n\u201cNow the pressure is on me to learn Italian,\u201d he added with a grin.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Joplin (Mo.) Globe, http://www.joplinglobe.com", "KANSAS CITY, Kan. (AP) \u2014 Two years ago, 38 percent of the residents at a southwest Kansas nursing home were on anti-psychotic drugs \u2014 one of the highest medication rates in Kansas, a state with one of the highest rates in the nation.\n\nThe sedatives are intended only for people with serious mental illness, but are sometimes used to calm people with Alzheimer\u2019s and dementia, even though the drugs increase the risk of falls, heart attacks and other deadly events.\n\nAfter learning how far out of the norm their facility was, administrators at High Plains Retirement Village at Kearny County Hospital reduced their anti-psychotic rate to almost zero in 18 months, by training their staff to control misbehavior in other ways, the Kansas City Star reported.\n\n\u201cWe definitely knew we needed to do something different,\u201d said Mary Chipley, the retirement home\u2019s director of nursing.\n\nAnd other nursing homes are following their lead.\n\nAfter years as one of the worst states when it comes to using dangerous medications to sedate people, Kansas showed marked improvement in the latest federal data released last month by the National Partnership to Improve Dementia Care in Nursing Homes.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2018, the percentage of long-term nursing home residents on anti-psychotics in Kansas was 17.4 percent \u2014 the state\u2019s lowest rate since the partnership started tracking it in 2011 and down from a high of 26 percent.\n\nImprovements at the end of 2017 and beginning of 2018 pushed Kansas to 38th in the country, after being tied at the bottom with Oklahoma and Mississippi as recently as 2016.\n\n\u201cI have to say I\u2019m pleased but also left wondering \u2014 what is different now that for the past two reporting quarters Kansas is showing reductions after climbing steadily worse in national rankings for years,\u201d said Mitzi McFatrich, executive director of Kansas Advocates for Better Care.\n\nGreater public awareness might be playing a role.\n\nMcFatrich\u2019s group launched a campaign last year for stronger informed consent rules for nursing home residents and their families before anti-psychotic drugs can be dispensed. It resulted in a bill that didn\u2019t become law, but got a hearing in the Kansas Legislature.\n\nThe Star also reported extensively on the issue last year, compiling a public database that listed anti-psychotic use rates for individual nursing homes in Kansas. And the national nonprofit Human Rights Watch published a report in February on improper use of the drugs that spotlighted Kansas and five other states.\n\nNursing home trade associations and administrators have also launched their own education efforts.\n\nDeb Zehr, the president and CEO of LeadingAge Kansas, said 34 of the nonprofit nursing homes her organization represents are now under 10 percent for anti-psychotic use.\n\n\u201cIn my experience Maya Angelou was right: Good people do better when they know better,\u201d Zehr said.\n\nLeadingAge Kansas and Washburn University have applied for state funding to launch a comprehensive training program with on-site assistance for nursing home staff.\n\nZehr said doctors are also becoming more cognizant of the federal guidelines on anti-psychotic use for people with dementia.\n\nNursing home groups have long said that\u2019s a key part of the equation, as many residents come into their facilities already on the drugs. An AARP report published earlier this year found that improper prescribing of anti-psychotic drugs is growing for seniors with dementia who live outside of nursing homes, even as it dips for those inside facilities.\n\nMissouri\u2019s nursing homes have not seen the same improvement over the last two years and were worse than Kansas\u2019 in the latest data.\n\nMissouri\u2019s anti-psychotic use rate declined steadily from 26.1 percent in 2011 to 18.5 percent in mid-2016. But it has remained there or even higher since, and at 18.6 percent it\u2019s now fifth worst in the nation, ahead of only Oklahoma (19.5 percent), Alabama (19.4 percent), Illinois (19.3 percent) and Mississippi (18.8 percent).\n\nLorraine Phillips, a University of Missouri Sinclair School of Nursing professor, has studied the issue in that state. She and four colleagues published a research paper earlier this year that found that the fewer nurses available per patient, the more likely anti-psychotics are to be improperly prescribed.\n\n\u201cThere are other major factors that are associated with receipt of anti-psychotics in persons who don\u2019t have a qualified diagnosis, but staffing is one of them, for sure,\u201d Phillips said in a phone interview. \u201cAnd staffing is something that can be changed.\u201d\n\nBenjamin Anderson, the CEO of Kearny County Hospital, said it wasn\u2019t a change in staffing that drove his home\u2019s reduction, but a change in culture.\n\nHe said when the nursing home staff found out during an inspection that it had one of the highest anti-psychotic use rates in the state, it prompted some soul searching.\n\n\u201cWhen it was brought to our attention, then we had to ask the crucial question: \u2018Are we OK with this?\u2019\u201d Anderson said. \u201cWe concluded as a team we were not OK with it.\u201d\n\nSo the facility launched a multi-part plan to fix it. Nurses were required to get permission from Chipley before asking a physician for anti-psychotic medications for a resident.\n\nConsultants were brought in to train staff on how to handle difficult behaviors without medication, by getting to know residents\u2019 histories and personalities and what kinds of food or music they find comforting.\n\nAnderson said the change wasn\u2019t easy, but it was worth it.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, these are our family, these residents,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cThese are our friends and neighbors. They\u2019re the most vulnerable among us and we have a responsibility to avoid harm if at all possible.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Kansas City Star, http://www.kcstar.com", "FULTON, Mo. (AP) \u2014 Last summer, 56-year-old Scott Ward discovered a lump on the right side of his neck. His primary care physician told him to give it some time. After a month, Ward got a scan. And then a biopsy. It was throat cancer.\n\nHuman papillomavirus was determined to be the primary cause.\n\nCancer of the middle part of the throat, like the one Ward had, is now the most common HPV-related cancer, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2015, there were 15,479 cases among men and 3,438 among women in the U.S. The virus is also associated with more than 90 percent of cervical and anal cancers, 70 percent of vaginal and vulvar cancers and more than 60 percent of penile cancers.\n\nTo help prevent HPV-related diseases in a broader age range, the Food and Drug Administration expanded its approval for the HPV vaccine for people ages 27 to 45 early last month. The expansion was based on studies of women and men ages 27 to 45 that showed the original Gardasil was highly effective in preventing malignancies related to virus strains covered by the vaccine. The latest version of the vaccine, Gardasil 9, protects people against nine strains of the virus that cause genital warts and the majority of HPV-related cancer and other diseases.\n\nThe vaccine was previously approved for preteens and young adults between the ages of 9 and 26, and the CDC has recommended vaccination for preteens and young adults since 2007.\n\nBy high school, many people have already been exposed to HPV. More than 60 percent of students will have been exposed by the end of their four years of college, said Mark Hunter, a gynecologic oncologist at Ellis Fischel Cancer Center. An estimated one in two American adults is currently infected with HPV.\n\nMissouri\u2019s HPV vaccination rate has been one of the lowest in the country. Health care professionals and advocates like Ward are sharing their experiences to combat the misperceptions and misinformation on the internet, including the myth that the vaccine causes serious side effects (it doesn\u2019t).\n\nWard, who lives in Fulton and worked in construction, doesn\u2019t know when he was infected with the virus, but he has probably carried it for decades. What he did know was that he would try everything to improve his chance of survival.\n\nA couple of weeks after the diagnosis, he underwent six hours of surgery for removal of a malignant tonsil. Then, the doctor conducted a neck dissection and removed 22 lymph nodes, 14 of which were malignant. The operation left a scar from his chin through the right side of his neck, almost to his right ear.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t even the hardest part. In the seven weeks after the surgery, he endured 32 rounds of radiation and three rounds of chemotherapy.\n\n\u201cThey basically want to get you as close to death as they can to kill all your cells,\u201d Ward said.\n\nFighting cancer became his new occupation. Every morning, he got dressed, got cleaned up and forced himself to eat through the pain. He got to know all the health care technicians who gave him chemo because he saw them every day.\n\nBy the end of January, the course of treatments had ended. Ward is now in his ninth month of remission. But the thin red line through half of his neck and the swelling under his chin are not the only reminders of his battle with cancer.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got neuropathy in my fingers and my feet,\u201d Ward said. \u201cI\u2019ve got dry mouth. I still only have partial taste. And if you ever lose your taste, it\u2019s no fun and everything tastes terrible.\u201d\n\nIf he could, he would get the HPV vaccine.\n\n\u201cMy nurse told me there\u2019s other strains of the HPV,\u201d he said. \u201cEven though you\u2019ve gone through this, you\u2019ve had treatment, then you\u2019re good with this one, you could still get one of the others. So it would still help me if I was under the age of 45.\u201d\n\nHunter, the gynecologic oncologist, said a lot of patients, nurses and staff are paying out of their own pocket to get the vaccine. He hopes insurance companies will soon cover the costs for people 27 to 45.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re an insurance company, and then you\u2019ve prevented them from all the abnormal pap smears, from the biopsies, from the loop electrosurgical excision procedures that we do after the biopsy... If they can prevent all of that, it\u2019s definitely a cost savings,\u201d Hunter said.\n\nMeanwhile, vaccination for adolescents in Missouri, which is covered by most insurance policies, isn\u2019t happening in large numbers. In 2017, about 57 percent of 13- to 17-year-olds in Missouri had been given the first dose. Only about 40 percent of them are considered up to date.\n\nOne big reason for the low rate of complete vaccinations is a lack of awareness of the cancers HPV causes, said Sharon Humiston, a pediatrician affiliated with Children\u2019s Mercy Kansas City. Because the HPV vaccine is not yet required for enrollment in Missouri schools, parents tend to think the vaccine isn\u2019t important.\n\n\u201cParents ask: \u2018Is this really necessary? What are my kid\u2019s chances of getting this disease, and if he gets it, is it really such a big deal?\u2019\u201d Humiston said.\n\nPeople tend to undervalue prevention because they don\u2019t see the outcome of vaccination, which is no disease, she said.\n\n\u201cFor example, once there is not a lot of measles circulating in the community, it\u2019s easy to think we don\u2019t need the measles vaccine anymore,\u201d Humiston said. \u201cWe forget that measles didn\u2019t go extinct like a dinosaur; it\u2019s only under control because of vaccination of almost everyone in the community.\u201d\n\nBoys and girls need to be vaccinated before exposure because the vaccine does not clear an HPV infection that is already established, Humiston said.\n\n\u201cMy adolescent patient is more likely to have a serious health problem due to HPV than due to almost any other virus I\u2019m trying to prevent with vaccination,\u201d she said. \u201cI cannot present this as an \u2018optional\u2019 vaccine \u2014 it\u2019s a necessary vaccine if what I\u2019m concerned about is health.\u201d\n\nAnother reason some patients haven\u2019t received the vaccine is because the pediatrician or family physician doesn\u2019t bring it up, Humiston said.\n\n\u201cThere are so many things that need to be covered in an adolescent visit, and the doctor may have figured, \u2018Oh, this can wait until the next visit.\u2019 But then there was no \u2018next visit,\u2019\u201d Humiston said. \u201cAs adolescents get older, they are less and less likely to be seen in a primary care setting.\u201d\n\nTo make matters worse, misinformation on the internet needlessly frightens parents. Some of the \u201cinformation\u201d that pops up is anecdotal and emotional, affecting people unconsciously.\n\n\u201cFear is like purple ink \u2014 even a little bit stains everything in the laundry,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a lasting stain.\u201d\n\nPediatrician John Wilson tries to keep up with the misinformation circulating in the anti-vaccine community, so he can deal with patients\u2019 questions and doubts. What he sees is a few people making a lot of money via clickbait, books, films and speaking tours that stoke fear.\n\n\u201cA large part of it is selling supplements,\u201d Wilson said, \u201cThey convince parents that if you\u2019re not going to vaccinate, then you need to boost children\u2019s immune systems in other ways, and that is through buying their supplements.\u201d\n\nStarting from Andrew Wakefield\u2019s fraudulent study linking vaccines and autism in 1998, conspiracy theories about vaccine safety have been produced and rebutted, but they keep coming back, Wilson said. That\u2019s in spite of the voluminous research that shows vaccines are safe and effective.\n\n\u201cWe know more certainly what the risks from vaccines are than we know about the antibiotics that we use on a daily basis in kids,\u201d Wilson said.\n\nBefore the three HPV vaccines were licensed by the FDA, each of them underwent years of testing through clinical trials, according to the CDC. Combined, the vaccines were studied in more than 74,000 men and women. The findings of the trials and subsequent studies show that the vaccine is safe and effective. The most common side effects include pain and redness in the area where the shot was given, and sometimes fever, dizziness, and nausea, which are usually mild and go away quickly.\n\nAnd yet the facts aren\u2019t enough to persuade a scared parent.\n\nVictoria Shaffer, an MU associate professor at the psychological science department, studies how narratives affect health communication. She found that after reading stories about what other people perceive to be the negative outcomes associated with vaccines, people\u2019s decision-making was affected \u2014 but they were unaware of it.\n\nIn one study, researchers gave participants data from the Vaccine Adverse Event Recording System, including some stories about bad things that happened to people who received vaccines. Although the participants said the stories weren\u2019t convincing, they were affected by them, Shaffer said.\n\n\u201cThe very act of hearing the stories changed their attitudes and made them more negative toward HPV vaccines. So even if you hear untrue stories, you can be influenced by them,\u201d Shaffer said.\n\nThe use of narratives causes what decision psychologists refer to as \u201cbase rate neglect,\u201d where people are more influenced by the vividness of the event than its likelihood of occurrence, Shaffer explained.\n\n\u201cWe are storytellers and we collect our worldview based on the story we\u2019ve experienced, and the stories that we\u2019ve heard from others,\u201d Shaffer said.\n\nShaffer said she and other researchers found it challenging to tell a positive story about vaccination, which is usually a nonevent.\n\n\u201cThe hard part about that story is that HPV and the consequences of it are so far removed from the time window of vaccination,\u201d Shaffer said. \u201cThere don\u2019t exist a lot of stories about people who are like, \u2018I love vaccines, I\u2019ve never gotten sick.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe current low vaccination rate is shocking to Hunter, who treats women of all ages with HPV-related cancers on a daily basis. He sees women in their 30s or 40s come in with stage three or four cervical cancer, and most of them won\u2019t survive the disease, he said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to leave behind young children,\u201d Hunter said, \u201cAnd these are diseases that could have been entirely prevented.\u201d\n\nAnywhere he has an audience, he usually gives a plug for vaccinating children with what is the first successful vaccination against cancer, Hunter said.\n\nHunter also served in an advisory capacity to the HPV vaccination program launched by the Ellis Fischel Cancer Center last year. University Hospital partnered with the Texas-based MD Anderson Cancer Center on the Moon Shots program, which aims to improve cancer prevention, early detection and treatment across the country.\n\nWard said he was very fortunate because the doctors caught his cancer early enough. He now tells his story to his family and friends. One of the misconceptions he has confronted is that a lot of people still don\u2019t know that males need to be vaccinated.\n\n\u201cI talked to my neighbors,\u201d Ward said, \u201cShe says \u2018Boys? HPV?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI said, you have got to talk to your doctor,\u201d Ward said. \u201cAll I can do is tell you what I know, and the experience that I\u2019m going through. This is what caused this, and I can tell you firsthand.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou get it, you know, you\u2019re done. You don\u2019t get it, you run the chance,\u201d he said.\n\nHe won\u2019t know for another five years whether he\u2019s cured. Looking back, Ward wishes there had been an HPV vaccine for him when he was a kid.\n\n\u201cIf there was a vaccine, I would (get it),\u201d he said. \u201cI myself would hope my parents would have wanted me to get it.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Columbia Missourian, http://www.columbiamissourian.com", "In this Tuesday, March 21, 2017 file photo, UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin addresses the media at a news conference in Prague, Czech Republic.

The military is expected to have the vast majority of the more than 7,000 troops planned for the mission along the border deployed by Monday, and that number could grow. (AP Photo/Gregory Bull)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump issued a proclamation Friday to deny asylum to migrants who enter the country illegally, tightening the border as caravans of Central Americans slowly approach the United States. The plan was immediately challenged in court.\n\nTrump invoked the same powers he used last year to impose a travel ban that was upheld by the Supreme Court. The new regulations are intended to circumvent laws stating that anyone is eligible for asylum no matter how he or she enters the country. About 70,000 people per year who enter the country illegally claim asylum, officials said.\n\n\u201cWe need people in our country, but they have to come in legally,\u201d Trump said Friday as he departed for Paris.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union and other legal groups swiftly sued in federal court in Northern California to block the regulations, arguing the measures were illegal.\n\n\u201cThe president is simply trying to run roughshod over Congress\u2019s decision to provide asylum to those in danger regardless of the manner of one\u2019s entry,\u201d said ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt.\n\nThe litigation also seeks to put the new rules on hold while the case progresses.\n\nThe regulations go into effect Saturday. They would be in place for at least three months but could be extended, and don\u2019t affect people already in the country. The Justice Department said in a statement the regulations were lawful.\n\nTrump\u2019s announcement was the latest push to enforce a hard-line stance on immigration through regulatory changes and presidential orders, bypassing Congress, which has not passed any immigration law reform. But those efforts have been largely thwarted by legal challenges and, in the case of family separations this year, stymied by a global outcry that prompted Trump to retreat.\n\nOfficials said the asylum law changes are meant to funnel migrants through official border crossings for speedy rulings instead of having them try to circumvent such crossings on the nearly 2,000-mile (3,200-kilometer) border. The U.S. Border Patrol says it apprehended more than 50,000 people crossing illegally in October, setting a new high this year, though illegal crossings are well below historical highs from previous decades.\n\nBut the busy ports of entry already have long lines and waits, forcing immigration officials to tell some migrants to turn around and come back to make their claims. Backlogs have become especially bad in recent months at crossings in California, Arizona and Texas, with some people waiting five weeks to try to claim asylum at San Diego\u2019s main crossing.\n\n\u201cThe arrival of large numbers ... will contribute to the overloading of our immigration and asylum system and to the release of thousands ... into the interior of the United States,\u201d Trump said in the proclamation, calling it a crisis.\n\nAdministration officials said those denied asylum under the proclamation may be eligible for similar forms of protection if they fear returning to their countries, though they would be subject to a tougher threshold. Those forms of protection include \u201cwithholding of removal\u201d \u2014 which is similar to asylum, but doesn\u2019t allow for green cards or bringing families \u2014 or protection under the United Nations Convention Against Torture.\n\nHomeland Security officials said they were adding staffing at the border crossings to manage the expected crush, but it\u2019s not clear how migrants, specifically families, would be held as their cases are adjudicated. Family detention centers are largely at capacity. Trump has said he wanted to erect \u201ctent cities,\u201d but nothing has been funded.\n\nThe U.S. is also working with Mexico in an effort to send some migrants back across the border. Right now, laws allow only Mexican nationals to be swiftly returned and increasingly those claiming asylum are from Central America.\n\nTrump pushed immigration issues hard in the days leading up to Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections, railing against the caravans that are still hundreds of miles from the border.\n\nHe has made little mention of the issue since the election, but has sent troops to the border in response. As of Thursday, there were more than 5,600 U.S. troops deployed to the border mission, with about 550 actually working on the border in Texas.\n\nTrump also suggested he\u2019d revoke the right to citizenship for babies born to non-U.S. citizens on American soil and erect massive \u201ctent cities\u201d to detain migrants. Those issues were not addressed by the regulations. But Trump insisted the citizenship issue would be pushed through.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re signing it. We\u2019re doing it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe administration has long said immigration officials are drowning in asylum cases partly because people falsely claim asylum and then live in the U.S. with work permits. In 2017, the U.S. fielded more than 330,000 asylum claims, nearly double the number two years earlier and surpassing Germany as highest in the world.\n\nMigrants who cross illegally are generally arrested and often seek asylum or some other form of protection. Claims have spiked in recent years and the immigration court backlog has more than doubled to 1.1 million cases in about two years, Syracuse University\u2019s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse reported this week. Generally, only about 20 percent of applicants are approved.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how many people en route to the U.S. will even make it to the border. Roughly 5,000 migrants \u2014 more than 1,700 under the age of 18 \u2014 sheltered in a Mexico City sports complex decided to depart Friday for the northern city of Tijuana, opting for the longer but likely safer route to the U.S. border.\n\nSimilar caravans have gathered regularly over the years and have generally dwindled by the time they reach the southern border, particularly to Tijuana. Most have passed largely unnoticed.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Elliot Spagat in San Diego, Nomaan Merchant in Houston and Jill Colvin and Zeke Miller in Washington contributed to this report.", "Portland Trail Blazers guard Damian Lillard, left, passes the ball as he runs into Los Angeles Clippers forward Danilo Gallinari during the second half of an NBA basketball game in Portland, Ore., Thursday, Nov. 8, 2018.

(AP) \u2014 New Mexico\u2019s Democratic governor-elect signaled a new approach to border security and immigration that emphasizes humanitarian concerns and skepticism of the White House, as the reins of state government pass from one Latina governor to another.\n\nU.S. Congresswoman and Gov.-elect Michelle Lujan Grisham said Friday that she is worried about the well-being of women and children in migrant caravans approaching the U.S. from Mexico and may reconsider the state\u2019s decision to deploy local National Guard troops to the border.\n\n\u201cI worry about the women and children in that caravan,\u201d said Lujan Grisham, who won Tuesday\u2019s election in a landslide against GOP U.S. Rep. Steve Pearce.\n\nRepublican Gov. Susana Martinez in April deployed fewer than 200 troops to the state\u2019s border with Mexico at President Donald Trump\u2019s request. That was before concerns about the migrant caravan prompted a new federal deployment of more than 5,000 troops.\n\nThe Trump administration is warning that the caravans will further overwhelm asylum systems. On Friday, the president ordered that anyone who enters the U.S. illegally from Mexico by going around official border crossings is ineligible for asylum.\n\nLujan Grisham, who will become one of four border governors come Jan. 1, suggested the U.S. should be prepared to offer humanitarian support and asylum application services for migrants, regardless of where they arrive.\n\nShe expressed skepticism of the Trump administration\u2019s portrayal of immigration and border security situations.\n\n\u201cI have not been confident about the president\u2019s or Homeland Security\u2019s information, I haven\u2019t found it credible \u2014 in many details, in many ways,\u201d Lujan Grisham said. \u201cIf I can\u2019t get information in January that shifts my thinking, particularly with assignment of troops on the border, I would likely reconsider the National Guard being on the border.\u201d\n\nThe comments were made at a news conference in the state Capitol as Martinez, who leaves office at the end of the year based on term limitations, and Lujan Grisham discussed details of the transition of power.\n\nIn a Friday morning television interview, Lujan Grisham attributed her election victory to her campaign\u2019s focus on a much different subject: a proposed overhaul of the state\u2019s troubled public education system, including higher pay for teachers and funding for universal access to preschool.\n\nNew Mexico, a former Spanish colony with an uninterrupted history of Hispanics in politics, is marking an unprecedented transition between two Latina governors \u2014 with divergent political ideologies on major issues.\n\nMartinez won office in 2010 and re-election in 2014 as the nation\u2019s only Latina governor and took issue with Trump\u2019s characterization of Mexican immigrants as criminals and rapists when he was running for president. She and the president have since reconciled.\n\nLujan Grisham is a staunch critic of Trump\u2019s approach to immigration, including his expansion of the border wall, and has promised to pursue major changes from Martinez\u2019s approach to teacher evaluations, state investments, renewable energy, gun control, marijuana regulation and more.", "FILE - In this Sept. 2, 2014, file photo, Rep. Collin Peterson, D-Minn., listens to a question in Hot Springs, Ark. Prospects for Congress passing a new five-year farm bill before the end of the year have improved in the wake of this week's midterm elections because Republicans have lost their leverage for imposing stricter work requirements on food stamp recipients, a key lawmaker and other experts said Thursday, Nov. 8, 2018. \"There isn't any reason why this thing can't get done,\" said Rep. Collin Peterson, of Minnesota, the ranking Democrat on the House Agriculture Committee, who's expected to regain the chairmanship next year.(AP Photo/Danny Johnston, File)\n\nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 Prospects have improved for Congress to pass a bipartisan farm bill before the end of the year after Democrats secured the House majority during the midterm elections, key lawmakers and other experts said.\n\nWork requirements for food stamps, known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, had been the biggest stumbling block holding up an agreement. The version that narrowly passed the House with no Democratic votes includes the tougher rules. The bipartisan version that won easy Senate approval does not, and few Senate Republicans want them.\n\nObservers say it\u2019s likely that House Republicans will now be ready to pass a compromise in the upcoming lame duck session rather than starting over in a Democratic-controlled House and risking a result they would like even less.\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t any reason why this thing can\u2019t get done,\u201d said Rep. Collin Peterson, of Minnesota, the ranking Democrat on the House Agriculture Committee and the likely chairman next year. \u201cThe only thing I care about between now and the end of the year is getting this farm bill done.\u201d\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said a news conference Friday in Frankfort, Kentucky, that passing a farm bill is one of his top priorities for the lame duck session, too. McConnell, who like Peterson is on the conference committee that\u2019s trying to work out a final deal, said compromise on work requirements is needed.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the part that is a little tricky, but we\u2019ll get there,\u201d McConnell said.\n\nFarm bills traditionally set federal agricultural and food policy for five years. While they include safety net programs for farmers, nutrition programs including SNAP are most of the spending. The current law expires at the end of the year. While Peterson might have even more influence on shaping the legislation as chairman, he told The Associated Press that he doesn\u2019t want to wait, given how hard farmers have been hit by low prices and trade disputes.\n\n\u201cThe farmers need certainty,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re facing some of the toughest times we\u2019ve had for a long time. The last thing they need is not knowing what the farm bill is going to be.\u201d\n\nRepublicans would have kept pushing hard for the work requirements if they\u2019d retained control of the House, said Marin Bozic, a professor of applied economics and agricultural policy expert at the University of Minnesota. But the impending Democratic takeover, including Peterson\u2019s expected rise to the chairmanship, have changed the dynamics, Bozic said.\n\nPeterson said he spoke this week with Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue and the current House Agriculture Committee chairman, Michael Conaway, as well as key senators, and those conversations left him optimistic about getting their remaining differences resolved.\n\nConaway, a Texas Republican, has said little publicly, and his spokeswoman said he was not available for an interview Thursday. But he put out a statement Wednesday that said: \u201cThis week\u2019s election results don\u2019t change the circumstances in farm country. I remain 100 percent committed to completing the farm bill this year.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump said at a news conference Wednesday that he still wants the stricter work requirements.\n\n\u201cEverybody wants it, the farmers want it, but the Democrats are not approving the farm bill with work rules,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe could have it very fast without the work rules, but we want the work rules in and the Democrats just don\u2019t want to vote for that. So at some point, they\u2019ll have to pay maybe a price.\u201d\n\nBut Peterson said Perdue did not say during their conversation Tuesday night that Trump would veto a version that lacked stricter work requirements. He said SNAP already has work requirements, but many states have been granted waivers, and a compromise could include tightening the waiver rules.\n\nMajor farm groups made fresh calls this week for lawmakers to finish the job this year. Paul Bleiberg, vice president of government relations for the National Milk Producers Federation, said the tone from all the key players and everything else he\u2019s hearing is that \u201cthey\u2019re pretty intent on getting it done by the end of the year. ... I don\u2019t think anyone wants it to linger in the coming year.\u201d\n\nThe prevailing attitude on Capitol Hill and among farm groups, Bleiberg said, is: \u201cYou\u2019ve gotten this far. Who wants to hit the reset button now?\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press reporter Bruce Schreiner contributed to this story from Frankfort, Kentucky.", "Protestors gather in front of the White House in Washington, Thursday, Nov. 8, 2018, as part of a nationwide \"Protect Mueller\" campaign demanding that acting U.S. Attorney General Matthew Whitaker recuse himself from overseeing the ongoing special counsel investigation. (AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The White House is bracing for the probe of Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign to fire up again. Trump\u2019s advisers are privately expressing worries that the special counsel, who\u2019s been out of the news for the past month, has been stealthily compiling information and could soon issue new indictments or a damning final report.\n\nTrump abruptly altered the chain of command above Mueller on Wednesday, putting his work under the supervision of a Republican loyalist who has been openly skeptical of the special counsel\u2019s authority and has mused about ways to curtail his power. But Trump and his aides are concerned about Mueller\u2019s next move with the work that is complete, according to a White House official and a Republican with close ties to the administration.\n\nThey insisted on anonymity to comment on conversations they were not authorized to describe.\n\nMueller kept a low profile for the past month as voters were mulling their choices for this week\u2019s elections.\n\nBut a flurry of activity during his quiet period, including weeks of grand jury testimony about Trump confidant Roger Stone and negotiations over an interview with the president, hinted at public developments ahead as investigators move closer to addressing key questions underpinning the special counsel inquiry: Did Trump illegally obstruct the investigation? And did his campaign have advance knowledge of illegally hacked Democratic emails?\n\nTrump has told confidants he remains deeply annoyed by the 18-month-old Mueller probe, believing it is not just a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d but an expensive and lengthy negative distraction. The latest indication of the fury came Wednesday when he forced out his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, whose recusal opened the door to Mueller\u2019s appointment.\n\nTo this point, Trump has heeded advice not to directly interfere, though a new chapter in the relationship with the probe may have begun with the appointment of Matthew Whitaker as new acting attorney general. Even if Whitaker, Sessions\u2019 former chief of staff, does not curtail the investigation, Trump could direct him to take a more aggressive stance in declassifying documents that could further undermine or muddle the probe, the White House aide and Republican official said.\n\nThe investigation until now has been overseen by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who appointed Mueller last year and granted him fairly broad authority.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very significant because Whitaker\u2019s position on indictments or future indictments may be different than Rosenstein\u2019s, and Rosenstein had given Mueller a broad mandate to pursue various crimes,\u201d said Washington criminal defense lawyer Jeffrey Jacobovitz.\n\nOn Friday, Trump moved to distance himself from Whitaker, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know Matt Whitaker.\u201d But he also called him \u201csmart\u201d and \u201crespected.\u201d\n\nThe Mueller investigation has so far produced 32 criminal charges and four guilty pleas from Trump associates. But the work is not done.\n\nA clear focus concerns Stone, a longtime political dirty trickster. The special counsel\u2019s team has been investigating Stone\u2019s connection to WikiLeaks during the 2016 campaign and whether he had advance knowledge of the group\u2019s plans to release hacked material damaging to Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\nStone has said he did not, but emails, Twitter messages and his own public statements show he portrayed himself as plugged into the WikiLeaks orbit. That includes implying he had inside knowledge in separate email exchanges with a Breitbart editor and Steve Bannon, the former Trump campaign chief executive, just days before WikiLeaks began releasing thousands of emails stolen from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta.\n\nBannon and other Stone associates have been questioned, and multiple witnesses have appeared before the grand jury. One associate, Jerome Corsi, said in a video recording Monday that he\u2019s \u201cbeen involved in a really constant basis\u201d for two months with Mueller\u2019s investigation.\n\nOn Thursday, a federal appeals court heard a challenge to Mueller\u2019s authority brought by Stone aide Andrew Miller, who defied a grand jury subpoena last summer and was held in contempt by a judge.\n\nIn the president\u2019s orbit, there remains some concern about his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., though there are no outward indications that charges are imminent, according to a Republican close to the White House not authorized to speak publicly about private conversations.\n\nBeyond Mueller, but also within the Justice Department\u2019s oversight, is a federal investigation into Trump\u2019s longtime legal fixer, Michael Cohen, who admitted as part of a guilty plea in August to coordinating with Trump on a hush-money scheme to silence a porn actress and an ex-Playboy model who say they had affairs with Trump.\n\nThe president hasn\u2019t been charged with any wrongdoing, but federal prosecutors have said that a grand jury investigation is ongoing and it targets unspecified \u201cothers.\u201d Court papers show Trump\u2019s conduct and that of top executives at the Trump Organization, some of whom have received immunity, have been scrutinized.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what additional charges prosecutors are pursuing and how much of it pertains to the president personally. Federal prosecutors have said in court papers that the case involves numerous \u201cuncharged\u201d third parties and have argued against disclosing search warrants and other documents that would \u201ccertainly result in a very public guessing game\u201d about their identities.\n\nOverseeing it all is Whitaker, a former college football player and U.S. attorney from Iowa who was brought into the Justice Department last year to serve as Sessions\u2019 chief of staff. In the months before, Whitaker was a familiar presence on CNN, where he questioned Mueller\u2019s scope and reach.\n\nIn one appearance, he defended a June 2016 Trump Tower meeting between Trump Jr. and a Kremlin-connected Russian lawyer, saying, \u201cYou would always take that meeting.\u201d\n\nHe also once tweeted an ex-prosecutor\u2019s opinion piece that described the Mueller team as a \u201clynch mob,\u201d and wrote his own op-ed saying Mueller would be outside his authority if he investigated Trump\u2019s family finances.\n\nTrump had enjoyed Whitaker\u2019s cable TV appearances \u2014 including one on CNN in which he suggested that the Mueller probe be starved of resources \u2014 and the two men soon struck a bond. Trump told associates that he felt that Whitaker would be \u201cloyal\u201d and would not have recused himself from the Russia probe as Sessions had done, according to two Republicans close to the White House not authorized to speak publicly about private conversations.\n\nDespite demands from Democrats that he recuse because of his past comments, Whitaker showed no signs Thursday that he intended to do so. And not everyone is convinced he needs to.\n\n\u201cBased on my experience with Matt,\u201d said John Richter, a former U.S. Attorney in Oklahoma and high-ranking Bush administration Justice Department official, \u201cI think he will act consistently with the best traditions of the department and call things as he sees them.\u201d\n\nTrump, speaking to reporters Friday, stressed that Whitaker was serving as attorney general in an acting capacity.

When told it was in a town about 20 miles (30 kilometers) away, he carefully wrote the name of the town on his hand with a pen to remember where he was going.\n\nDeported for driving without a license after a decade working in Connecticut, Castanaza was desperate to get back to his two U.S.-born children. \u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to get back for more than a year, but I couldn\u2019t until the caravan came through,\u201d said Castanaza. \u201cThat\u2019s why I joined the caravan.\u201d\n\nThe advanced group hoped to reach the north-central city of Queretaro, about 105 miles (170 kilometers) to the northwest, by nightfall.\n\nMeanwhile, at least 4,000 migrants milled around the massive shelter improvised at a Mexico City sports complex, impatient to leave.\n\nNinety percent of the remaining migrants will depart the stadium early Saturday on their long trek to Tijuana, first taking the subway to the northern exit from Mexico\u2019s capital, according to Nashieli Ramirez, director of Mexico\u2019s Human Rights Commission.\n\nFrom there, they will pass through the Mexican cities of Queretaro, Guadalajara, Culiacan and Hermosillo on their way to the U.S. border, Ramirez said, adding that 400 Mexicans had chosen to stay in Mexico City.\n\nThe governor of Queretaro state, Francisco Dominguez, said the migrants would stay at Corregidora stadium in the state\u2019s capital and that authorities were ready to host 4,000 people.\n\nMeanwhile, migrants in the stadium in southern Mexico City were getting impatient.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go, let\u2019s go!\u201d shouted Eddy Rivera, 37, a rail-thin migrant from Honduras who said he couldn\u2019t take staying in the camp any longer. \u201cWe are all sick, from the humidity and the cold,\u201d said Rivera, who left behind four children and a wife in Honduras. \u201cWe have to get going, we have to get to Tijuana.\u201d\n\nThough he was unsure how an unskilled farmworker like himself would be allowed in the United States, he had a simple dream: earn enough money to build a little house for his family back in Puerto Cortes, Honduras.\n\nThousands of migrants have spent the past few days resting, receiving medical attention and debating how to proceed with their arduous trek through Central America and Mexico which began in mid-October. On Thursday, caravan representatives met with officials from the local United Nations office and demanded buses to take them to the border, saying the trek would be too hard and dangerous for walking and hitchhiking.\n\nCaravan coordinator Milton Benitez said officials had offered them buses for women and children but organizers demanded that they be for everyone. By Friday, the migrants said they were so angry at the U.N.\u2019s lack of help that they no longer wanted U.N. observers with the caravan.\n\nThe United Nations on Friday denied the offer, releasing a statement saying its agencies \u201care unable to provide the transportation demanded by some members of the caravan.\u201d\n\nThe migrants made a big point of sticking together, their only form of self-protection.\n\nFelix Rodriguez, 35, of Choluteca, Honduras had been at the Mexico City sports complex for more than a week.\n\n\u201cWe all want to get moving,\u201d he said. But he was waiting for the main group to leave Saturday, noting \u201cit is better to leave in a group, because leaving in small bunches is dangerous.\u201d\n\nMexico City is more than 600 miles from the nearest U.S. border crossing at McAllen, Texas, but the area around the Mexican border cities of Reynosa, Matamoros and Nuevo Laredo is so rife with drug gangs that the migrants consider it too dangerous to risk.\n\nA previous caravan in the spring opted for the longer route to Tijuana in the far northwest, across from San Diego. That caravan steadily dwindled to only about 200 people by the time it reached the border.\n\n\u201cCalifornia is the longest route but is the best border, while Texas is the closest but the worst\u201d border, said Jose Luis Fuentes of the National Lawyers Guild.\n\nMexico has offered refuge, asylum or work visas to the migrants, and its government said 2,697 temporary visas had been issued to individuals and families to cover them while they wait for the 45-day application process for a more permanent status. On Wednesday, a bus left from Mexico City to return 37 people to their countries of origin.\n\nBut many want to continue on toward the United States.\n\nAuthorities say most have refused offers to stay in Mexico, and only a small number have agreed to return to their home countries.

And no angry mobs in suits \u2014 at least not yet.\n\nThe deeply purple state will learn Saturday whether recounts will be held in the bitter, tight U.S. Senate race between Republican Gov. Rick Scott and incumbent Democrat Bill Nelson; and in the governor\u2019s race between former Republican U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis and the Democratic mayor of Tallahassee, Andrew Gillum.\n\nThe state\u2019s recount procedures have been revised since Florida held the country hostage for a month 18 years ago, when George W. Bush edged Al Gore for the presidency. Among other things, the infamous punch-card ballots are no longer.\n\nYet, Scott and President Donald Trump on Friday alleged fraud without evidence, even as the often-laborious process of reviewing ballots in a close race continued ahead of the Saturday noon deadline. Both Scott and Nelson sought to get the courts to intervene.\n\nScott said \u201cunethical liberals\u201d were trying to steal the election in Democratic strongholds of Broward and Palm Beach counties. He suggested something was awry because vote-counters were taking longer there than in other jurisdictions, and his thin lead has kept narrowing since election night. Late Friday, he led by 0.18 percentage points, low enough to require a recount.\n\nFlorida Governor and Senate candidate Rick Scott says he is asking the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to investigate elections offices in Palm Beach and Broward counties, questioning whether they were trying to inflate the Democratic vote. (Nov. 9)\n\nA recount is mandatory if the winning candidate\u2019s margin is less than 0.5 percentage points when the first unofficial count is verified Saturday by Florida\u2019s secretary of state. If the margin is less than 0.25 percent, the recount must be done by hand.\n\nIn Washington, Trump took Scott\u2019s side, telling reporters that the federal government could get involved and adding: \u201cAll of the sudden, they are finding votes out of nowhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on in Florida is a disgrace,\u201d he said.\n\nScott asked the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to investigate the counties\u2019 election departments. However, a spokeswoman for the agency said there were no credible allegations of fraud; therefore, no active investigation.\n\nThe governor, meanwhile, filed lawsuits in both counties seeking more information on how their ballots were being tallied. Nelson filed his own federal lawsuit Friday, seeking to postpone the Saturday deadline to submit unofficial election results.\n\nA judge Friday sided with Scott and ordered Broward County\u2019s election supervisor to release the voter information sought by the governor.\n\nThe ruling came as the Broward Canvassing Board met to review ballots that had been initially deemed ineligible. Lawyers from the campaigns, journalists and citizens crowded into a room to observe.\n\nThe county has not answered questions about its process and how many votes it has left to count.\n\nRepublican U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio suggested that Brenda Snipes, the Broward supervisor of elections, should be removed from office once the dust settles on the race. Rubio said Snipes\u2019 failure to count all ballots in a more timely manner violates state law.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s certainly a candidate for removal. ... This is not one bad cycle, this is a pattern,\u201d Rubio said in a conference call with reporters.\n\nNelson issued barbs of his own.\n\n\u201cNo one should stand in the way of the people of our state exercising their right to vote and to have their voice heard,\u201d the senator said in a statement. \u201cClearly, Rick Scott is trying to stop all the votes from being counted and he\u2019s impeding the democratic process.\u201d\n\nIn the undecided race for governor, DeSantis was leading by 0.43 percentage points late Friday. That margin, if it holds, would require a recount, but DeSantis has mostly stayed out of the fray, saying he was working on plans for taking office in January.\n\nGillum conceded on election night, but as the vote margin began to narrow, he said he wanted to see every vote counted, strongly indicating he would not stand in the way of a recount.\n\nA third statewide race that could go to a recount \u2014 the agriculture commissioner race between Democrat Nikki Fried and Republican Matt Caldwell \u2014 is the tightest of all, with Fried holding a 3,120-vote lead \u2014 a margin of 0.039 percent.\n\nIn 2000, Broward and Palm Beach each played central roles in the Bush-Gore race.\n\nAt the time, both counties used punch card ballots \u2014 voters poked out chads, leaving tiny holes in their ballots representing their candidates. Some didn\u2019t press hard enough, leaving hanging or dimpled chads that had to be examined by hand, a long and tiresome process.\n\nPalm Beach also was home to the infamous \u201cbutterfly ballot\u201d that many Democrats believe cost Gore the election. An election official\u2019s attempt to make the candidate\u2019s names bigger and easier to read for senior citizens resulted in them being listed in two columns instead of one. Analysts later said the new redesign may have confused voters and probably cost Gore votes.\n\nAs for the angry mobs in suits: In late November 2000, Republican operatives in suits stormed the Miami-Dade canvassing board\u2019s meeting, causing the members to permanently stop their recount, even after police officers restored order. The melee became known as \u201cThe Brooks Brothers Riot.\u201d\n\n___\n\nBrendan Farrington in Tallahassee, Josh Replogle in Riviera Beach and Curt Anderson in Miami contributed.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "PHOENIX (AP) \u2014 The longtime head of Arizona\u2019s Medicaid program is retiring next year after 27 years of state service.\n\nTom Betlach (BET\u2019-lack) will step down as director of the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System in January.

Scott Applewhite)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Newly ascendant Democrats are promising congressional action on gun control amid a rash of mass shootings, including a late-night assault at a California bar that killed 12 people.\n\nMeasures including expanded background checks and a ban on assault-style weapons are likely to reach the House floor when Democrats retake control after eight years of Republican rule.\n\n\u201cThe American people deserve real action to end the daily epidemic of gun violence that is stealing the lives of our children on campuses, in places of worship and on our streets,\u201d said Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader who is running for a second stint as House speaker.\n\nPelosi vowed to push for a range of actions to stem gun violence, including restrictions on high-capacity magazines and a measure allowing temporary removal of guns from people deemed an imminent risk to themselves or others.\n\nThe measures could win approval in the Democratic-controlled House next year but will face opposition from the Republican-controlled Senate and the White House, where President Donald Trump has promised to \u201cprotect the Second Amendment.\u201d\n\nStill, gun control advocates believe they have the political momentum to make guns a central issue next year.\n\nThe political calculus on guns is changing, said Democratic Rep. Ted Deutch, whose Florida district includes the Parkland high school where 17 people were killed in February.\n\n\u201cWe saw it start on Tuesday and we\u2019re going to see it accelerate in January,\u201d he said.\n\nGun control was a major issue even before the most recent shootings. Lawmakers debated action following the Parkland attack and a 2017 shooting in Las Vegas that left 58 dead, and ultimately took modest steps to boost school safety funds and improve compliance with the federal background check system for gun purchases.\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 new majority includes dozens of candidates who support gun control, including Lucy McBath in Georgia, whose 17-year-old son was fatally shot in 2012 and who made gun violence the centerpiece of her campaign\n\nAt least 17 newly elected House Democrats back stricter gun laws, including Jennifer Wexton, Abigail Spanberger and Elaine Luria in Virginia, who defeated incumbents backed by the National Rifle Association. In Colorado, Democrat Jason Crow beat GOP Rep. Mike Coffman, who received an A rating from the NRA and more than $37,000 in campaign contributions from the group.\n\n\u201cI do think there\u2019s new energy\u201d on gun issues, even before the California assault late Wednesday night and an Oct. 27 shooting that killed 11 people at a Pittsburgh synagogue, said Kris Brown, co-president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence.\n\n\u201cOur base is worked up, and people are reacting in a positive way at the ballot box,\u201d said Brown, who campaigned with the three Virginia Democrats in the final week alongside a stream of volunteers. \u201cA large number of folks showed up and knocked on doors and said they finally have a candidate who will do something about gun violence,\u201d she said.\n\nWexton, Spanberger and Luria all made gun violence a central issue in their campaigns \u2014 disproving the notion that gun control is a \u201cthird rail\u201d of politics that Democrats should not talk about, Brown said. \u201cWe\u2019re finding candidates who aren\u2019t afraid to talk about this issue,\u201d she said.\n\nSpending to support candidates backing tougher gun control surged this year, even as campaign spending by the NRA declined. Everytown for Gun Safety, a group founded by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, pledged $30 million for this year\u2019s elections and continued to put new money into competitive races in the final days. A political action committee formed by Gabby Giffords, the former Arizona congresswoman wounded in a shooting, spent nearly $5 million.\n\nSixty-one percent of voters who responded to VoteCast, a survey of the electorate conducted by The Associated Press, said they support stricter gun laws, compared with 8 percent who said they should be loosened. Eighty-six percent of those supporting Democratic candidates backed stricter gun laws, along with 34 percent of those who supported Republicans.\n\nMcBath said her victory over Republican Rep. Karen Handel sent a strong message to the country. \u201cAbsolutely nothing \u2014 no politician & no special interest \u2014 is more powerful than a mother on a mission,\u201d she said in a tweet.\n\nMcBath, an African-American, became a spokeswoman for Everytown for Gun Safety after her son was slain at a Florida gas station by a white man angry over the loud music the black teenager and his friends had been playing in their car.\n\nWhile encouraged by the election results, gun control advocates know that getting any kind of weapons or ammunition ban signed into law will be difficult if not impossible in the next Congress.\n\nRepublicans expanded their Senate majority Tuesday and Trump remains a favored ally of the NRA.\n\nBut if the House votes to approve gun control and a bill is pending in the Senate, \u201cit\u2019s harder to ignore,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWe can keep the pressure on.\u201d\n\nDeutch said gun control opponents would be wise to heed Tuesday\u2019s results.\n\nFor years, GOP lawmakers thought they could avoid talking about gun control while accepting campaign contributions from the NRA and promoting an A rating from the group, he said. \u201cThey learned this week that just won\u2019t work anymore,\u201d Deutch said.", "FILE--In this May 22, 2018, file photo, former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio speaks during a campaign event in Phoenix.

(AP Photo/Matt York, File)\n\nPHOENIX (AP) \u2014 Maricopa County is opposing a request to give Latinos six more months to apply for taxpayer-funded compensation after they were illegally detained when then-Sheriff Joe Arpaio defied a 2011 court order.\n\nThe one-year period for filing claims is scheduled to end Dec. 3, but immigrant rights advocates say more time is needed to locate those who were illegally detained when Arpaio defied the order to stop his traffic patrols that targeted immigrants. Two years ago, a judge presiding over a racial profiling lawsuit targeting Arpaio\u2019s immigration patrols had ordered the county to create a $500,000 compensation fund as a remedy for the sheriff\u2019s acknowledged disobedience.\n\nEarlier this week, the county said in court records that the attorneys who filed the profiling case had originally suggested the one-year application period and are now trying to rewrite the terms of the compensating plan. The county\u2019s lawyers said it\u2019s unclear whether more people will file claims even if the judge agrees to a six-month extension. \u201cA deal is a deal,\u201d wrote Richard Walker, an attorney representing the county.\n\nIn the past, lawyers who filed the profiling lawsuit had said at least 190 people were detained in violation of the order. But with three weeks left in the application period, far fewer people than expected are filing claims, because of the difficulty of locating victims.\n\nOf the 93 people who filed applications, only one claim totaling $1,095 has been paid. Twelves other claims are considered payable, but are awaiting a rebuttal from the sheriff\u2019s office, according to county records.\n\nLawyers for Arpaio\u2019s successor, Sheriff Paul Penzone, said in court records that their client takes no position on extending the application period.\n\nArpaio, who was accused of prolonging the patrols to boost his successful 2012 re-election campaign, was later convicted of criminal contempt of court for violating the 2011 order. A pardon by President Donald Trump spared Arpaio, who lost the 2016 sheriff\u2019s race, a possible jail sentence.\n\nWhile the pardon led to the dismissal of Arpaio\u2019s criminal case, taxpayers in metro Phoenix remain on the hook for compensation for the illegal detentions in the patrols between late December 2011 and May 2013.\n\nUnder the compensation fund, Maricopa County will pay $500 for the first hour of a person\u2019s illegal detention and $35 for each additional 20-minute increment.\n\nA $10,000 cap was imposed on such compensation, but victims can also seek money for other injuries resulting from the illegal detentions such as lost wages and emotional distress.\n\n___\n\nFollow Jacques Billeaud at www.twitter.com/jacquesbilleaud", "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Matthew Whitaker has warned that Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation risks \u201cgoing too far\u201d and supported limits on the prosecutor\u2019s power. President Donald Trump couldn\u2019t agree more.\n\nSo the loyalty-loving Trump on Wednesday dumped Jeff Sessions from the helm of the Justice Department and replaced him, for now, with the onetime college football player and federal prosecutor. Unlike Sessions, who recused himself from the Russia investigation to Trump\u2019s everlasting fury, Whitaker will oversee it.\n\nTrump and the country already know much about Whitaker\u2019s perspective on the probe.\n\nA look at the investigation and what Whitaker has said about it:\n\n___\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nAfter months of bitter attacks on Sessions, Trump on Wednesday announced via Twitter that the former Alabama senator was being replaced. He named Whitaker, 49, who had served as Sessions\u2019 chief of staff, as acting attorney general, overseeing the Justice Department.\n\nThat job gives Whitaker the power to oversee the Russia probe. And though Democrats have called for him to recuse himself because of his past comments, the case is less clear-cut than it was for Sessions \u2014 who stepped aside because of his prominent role in Trump\u2019s campaign.\n\nThat\u2019s raising questions about the fate of Mueller\u2019s investigation. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein has been overseeing it because of Sessions\u2019 recusal. It includes questions about a 2016 Trump Tower meeting involving the president\u2019s son Donald Trump, Jr., and a Kremlin-connected lawyer offering damaging information about Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe ongoing investigation has produced guilty pleas from four former Trump aides.\n\nWhitaker is a former U.S. attorney from Iowa who founded a law firm with other Republican Party activists.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP TOWER, NO BIG DEAL?\n\nIn a July 10, 2017, appearance on CNN, Whitaker shrugged off the idea that the Trump Tower meeting could be part of a criminal conspiracy. He said \u201cthere was so much smoke\u201d surrounding Clinton that it made perfect sense for Trump Jr. to take a meeting at which he expected to receive dirt on her.\n\n\u201cYou would always take that meeting. You would have somebody from your campaign take the meeting to try to get the information,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you have somebody that you trust that is saying you need to meet with this individual because they have information about her, you would take that meeting.\u201d\n\n___\n\nRECOMMENDED READING\n\nOn Aug. 6, 2017, Whitaker tweeted an op-ed newspaper piece from a former Philadelphia prosecutor carrying the headline: \u201cNote to Trump\u2019s Lawyer: Do not cooperate with Mueller lynch mob.\u201d Whitaker accompanied the tweet with his own comment to his followers: \u201cWorth a Read.\u201d\n\n___\n\nBLEED IT DRY\n\nWhitaker laid out in a July 26, 2017, CNN appearance a hypothetical scenario in which Mueller\u2019s investigation could be stifled without him being fired.\n\nNoting that the special counsel\u2019s budget falls within the attorney general\u2019s purview, Whitaker said he could envision a situation in which Sessions was replaced as attorney general and replaced by a new boss who doesn\u2019t fire Mueller but \u201cjust reduces his budget to so low that his investigation grinds to almost a halt.\u201d\n\n__\n\nNO COLLUSION\n\nIn an interview with a conservative talk radio host, Whitaker said there was \u201cno collusion\u201d between Trump\u2019s presidential campaign and Russia, a key question being examined by the special counsel\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cThere was interference by the Russians into the election, but that was not collusion with the campaign,\u201d Whitaker said on \u201cThe Wilkow Majority.\u201d \u2033That\u2019s where the left seems to be combining those two issues.\u201d\n\n__\n\nREIN IT IN\n\nIn an Aug. 6, 2017, online opinion piece for CNN, Whitaker said Trump is \u201cabsolutely correct\u201d to say that Mueller would be going too far if he were to investigate the president\u2019s family finances. He said it did not take a lawyer or former federal prosecutor to recognize that any inquiry into Trump\u2019s finances \u201cfalls completely outside of the realm of his 2016 campaign and allegations that the campaign coordinated with the Russian government or anyone else.\u201d\n\n\u201cMueller has come up to a red line in the Russia 2016 election-meddling investigation that he is dangerously close to crossing,\u201d Whitaker wrote.\n\nThe headline on the op-ed: \u201cMueller\u2019s investigation of Trump is going too far.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Kellman and Tucker on Twitter at: http://www.twitter.com/APLaurieKellman and http://www.twitter.com/ETuckerAP", "YUMA, Ariz.

McCarthy burned up the phone lines Thursday shoring up his support. And down ballot, the GOP will add a familiar name to the leadership lineup \u2014 Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, a daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney who announced her bid for the No. 3 GOP leadership spot.\n\nBut the bigger battle continues to play out on the other side, where Democrats hold a slim majority, now at 225 seats. That leaves Pelosi little room for error as she rounds up the 218 votes needed to become the first woman to reclaim the speaker\u2019s gavel.\n\nPelosi\u2019s opponents said they were mobilizing Thursday and discussing writing a letter to show there are enough votes to block her from becoming speaker. Foes have tried to oust Pelosi before. But this time, they say their effort could show some two dozen new and returning House Democrats who won\u2019t give her their vote. On the campaign trail, several candidates said they\u2019d oppose her.\n\n\u201cWe have enough,\u201d said Rep. Kurt Schrader, D-Ore., one of those who described the effort.\n\nThe group was still deciding whether to draft the letter or state their case in person to Pelosi when House Democrats meet privately in the days ahead, he said. \u201cIf you add in all the recently elected members who have said they\u2019re not voting for Pelosi in our opening salvo, the math isn\u2019t there. She doesn\u2019t have the votes,\u201d Schrader said.\n\nPelosi\u2019s allies quickly swatted back the claim as exaggerated. She said this week she\u2019s confident she\u2019ll be speaker, and even got a boost from President Donald Trump, who said he\u2019d like to work with her. Several House races remain undecided, and her hold on the majority could grow if other Democrats are elected.\n\n\u201cLeader Pelosi is confident in her support,\u201d said spokesman Drew Hammill.\n\nAllies point out her opponents actually lost ground Thursday in a separate effort to challenge her leadership by revising the caucus rules for House Democrats.\n\nCongress returns next week to begin sorting out new leadership after eight years of Republican power. Closed-door sessions of voting for leadership positions will set the stage for the speaker\u2019s election in January, when the new members of Congress take their first votes.\n\nOn the GOP side, McCarthy, the House majority leader who is close to Trump, is favored for the top spot in the minority, but he has struggled to shore up support from the GOP\u2019s right flank of lawmakers. They have been skeptical of the California Republican and questioned his conservative bonafides. Some would prefer to elect a street fighter who will confront Pelosi\u2019s Democrats in the new House majority.\n\nTrump signaled he\u2019d be happy with McCarthy, but he\u2019s also promoted Jordan, the Ohio Republican, who is a regular on Fox News and popular with conservative groups beyond Washington.\n\nOn Thursday, McCarthy was calling colleagues, pledging to fight Democrats and win back the majority.\n\nMcCarthy promised \u201cto use every tool at our disposal to deliberately challenge House Democrats\u201d and protect Trump\u2019s agenda. In a letter to colleagues, he acknowledged losing the majority was \u201cdifficult\u201d and said the road ahead would be hard. \u201cI expect us to win back the House.\u201d\n\nTo become minority leader, McCarthy would need support from half the Republicans in the House. Their tally now stands at 197, but some races remain undecided. Jordan is expected to pick up support from dozens of members.\n\nJordan\u2019s bid remains a longshot, but he\u2019s making inroads into leadership for the Freedom Caucus, whose members want a seat at the table. His supporters outside the Capitol are revving up to support him.\n\n\u201cAre you going to elect the same people who lost the election, or are you going to elect someone new?\u201d asked Adam Brandon, president of the conservative group FreedomWorks, which announced its support Thursday for Jordan.\n\nIf McCarthy and Jordan both fall short, Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the GOP whip who was seriously wounded in last year\u2019s shooting at a congressional baseball team practice, could swoop in. For now, he\u2019s running to keep his position as vote counter.\n\nWhile Jordan, a former college wrestling champ, is seen as the brawler needed, his bid may be complicated by allegations this summer that, as an assistant wrestling coach at Ohio State University years ago, he did not do enough to counter claims of sexual abuse by the team doctor, who has since died. Jordan has denied knowing of any allegations of wrongdoing.\n\nHe\u2019s not the only Republican leader with baggage. Scalise has had to distance himself from an appearance in Lousiana by a group with ties to David Duke, a former leader of the Ku Klux Klan.

(AP) \u2014 Democrats did what was once unthinkable when they flipped two suburban Chicago congressional districts that had been held by Republicans pretty much since World War II.\n\nIt was territory that produced GOP stalwarts such as Henry Hyde and Dennis Hastert and where, until Tuesday, incumbents had regularly won re-election by 20 percentage points or more. But the Democratic successes didn\u2019t extend south to the farms and small towns of central and southern Illinois, where GOP congressmen held on to two other seats Democrats had targeted, including one in a blue-collar district that was reliably Democratic until just a few years ago.\n\nThe same pattern emerged across the U.S.: Democrats captured control of the House by winning in suburban areas such as northern Virginia and communities outside Los Angeles, Detroit and Minneapolis. Republicans fared better in the country\u2019s smaller towns and rural areas.\n\nThe depth of the divide emerged during 2016, when President Donald Trump was elected. It\u2019s clear he was also the driving factor this year.\n\n\u201cNationally, I want a check on Trump,\u201d said Nick Molino, a 33-year-old engineer who voted in his hometown of Wheaton, Illinois, west of Chicago. The new dad considers himself an independent and chose a mix of Democrats and Republicans on his ballot. He was sure to vote for Democrat Sean Casten, a former clean energy entrepreneur and first-time candidate, over six-term Republican Rep. Peter Roskam.\n\nCasten defeated Roskam by more than 5 percentage points in an affluent district west and northwest of Chicago that was high on Democrats\u2019 list of targets since voters there backed Hillary Clinton over Trump in 2016.\n\nNationally, urban and suburban voters preferred Democratic over Republican candidates, while voters in small towns and rural places favored Republicans, based on results from AP VoteCast, a nationwide survey of more than 115,000 voters and 20,000 nonvoters conducted for The Associated Press by NORC at the University of Chicago.\n\nTrump loomed large. Six in 10 Illinois voters considered him a factor in their choices, like voters nationally. About 4 in 10 voted to express opposition to the president, compared with about 2 in 10 who said it was to support Trump. Another 4 in 10 said Trump was not a factor, the survey found.\n\nAbout a third of small town and rural Illinois voters said they voted to support Trump, compared with about a quarter who voted against him. Another 44 percent said Trump was not a factor. More voters in urban and suburban areas voted in opposition to the president than in support of him.\n\nWhile Trump didn\u2019t campaign in the Chicago area, he was more engaged in holding off Democratic challenges in the two other Illinois districts, where voters favored him by larger numbers in 2016 and Republican Reps. Mike Bost and Rodney Davis won re-election on Tuesday.\n\nTrump campaigned with Bost in far southern Illinois just days before the election, holding a rally at a small airport in Bost\u2019s hometown. He also was in the district in August to tout his trade policies at a steel mill.\n\nBost defeated Democratic prosecutor Brendan Kelly by more than 6 percentage points, but that margin of victory was about half of what he achieved in his last two elections, a sign that gives Democrats hope for 2020. Davis\u2019 race, in a central Illinois district that includes two major universities, was even tighter. He topped Democrat Betsy Dirksen Londrigan by just 1 point.\n\nBack in the Chicago area, in a district neighboring Roskam\u2019s that includes rural spots along with suburbs, Democrat Lauren Underwood unseated four-term Rep. Randy Hultgren. The 32-year-old nurse, who\u2019s African-American, became the first woman and first minority to hold the seat that once belonged to Hastert, the longtime GOP House speaker who was later convicted in a hush-money case that revealed he had sexually abused high school students.\n\nThe district was redrawn after the 2010 census to make it an even safer Republican seat. That made Underwood\u2019s victory even more \u201cunbelievable,\u201d said former Illinois Republican Party Chairman Pat Brady, who opposed Trump\u2019s presidential bid and has been a vocal critic.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s never a district a Republican should lose,\u201d said Brady, who knocked on doors for both Roskam and Hultgren and said he heard from countless voters who dislike Trump. \u201cThat\u2019s squarely on the president.\u201d\n\nUnderwood, who worked in President Barack Obama\u2019s administration helping to implement the Affordable Care Act, focused heavily on health care and ensuring coverage of pre-existing conditions \u2014 an issue she stressed was important to voters of all political backgrounds. She spoke often of her own heart condition, which she manages through medication.\n\nShe said she won by spending time in every community, talking to and listening to voters who said they hadn\u2019t heard from a political candidate in years. Republicans had taken their vote for granted, while Democrats hadn\u2019t bothered to try winning them over. Trump won the district by 4 points over Clinton.\n\n\u201cI think that our race proves that what people have previously written off can\u2019t be written off anymore,\u201d Underwood said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Hannah Fingerhut in Washington and Martha Irvine in Wheaton, Illinois, contributed.", "", "", "SEATTLE (AP) \u2014 Myles Carter scored 25 points and grabbed 12 rebounds and Seattle coasted to a 95-67 win over Division II Puget Sound on Thursday night.\n\nCarter, a transfer from Seton Hall who sat out last year, was 11-of-15 shooting.

Whitaker, who on Wednesday became the nation\u2019s top law enforcement official after President Donald Trump named him acting attorney general.\n\nThe case against McCoy fell apart in court amid allegations of political bias and prosecutorial misconduct. A jury quickly acquitted McCoy of the criminal charge, deciding that he had not attempted to extort money from a former business partner.\n\nIn an interview Thursday, McCoy said he was shocked by Whitaker\u2019s elevation to lead the Justice Department . He said his case should serve as a warning that Whitaker will not hesitate to pursue Democrats and Trump\u2019s desire to curtail special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation.\n\nWhitaker said in a statement on Wednesday that he is \u201ccommitted to leading a fair Department with the highest ethical standards, that upholds the rule of law, and seeks justice for all Americans.\u201d Trump said on Twitter that Whitaker \u201cwill serve our Country well.\u201d\n\nMcCoy faced prosecution when Whitaker was a George W. Bush appointee serving as the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Iowa based in Des Moines. Democrats have alleged that it was one of several prosecutions of local officials brought during the Bush years that were tainted by political considerations \u2014 an allegation that Whitaker has denied.\n\nWhitaker announced at a news conference in March 2007 that a grand jury had charged McCoy with attempted extortion by an elected official, an offense that carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. He alleged that McCoy demanded and accepted $2,000 in payments from a businessman seeking to obtain a waiver to sell home security products for the elderly to Iowa\u2019s Medicaid program, threatening to block state business if he wasn\u2019t paid.\n\nWhitaker\u2019s office and the FBI spent months building a case against McCoy after Thomas Vasquez, a salesman with a history of financial, domestic and substance abuse problems, alleged that McCoy was trying to shake him down. Vasquez later agreed to be a paid informant, recording several conversations with McCoy and making what prosecutors called \u201cbribe payments\u201d to McCoy with money supplied by the FBI.\n\nMcCoy argued the indictment was based on out-of-context snippets of 12 hours of recorded conversations, and that his actions had an innocent explanation that his legal team shared with Whitaker early on.\n\nIn addition to being a senator, McCoy operated a consulting business. He said Vasquez, an acquaintance he met through Alcoholics Anonymous, had asked him to help market the security products as a consultant and he agreed. They signed a contract in which McCoy would be paid $100 for each unit sold. Vasquez went to the FBI after their relationship soured. McCoy said that he later accepted payments from Vasquez because he believed that he was following through with their deal.\n\nHis lawyers argued that Whitaker\u2019s office committed prosecutorial misconduct by not playing for the grand jury parts of the recordings that were exculpatory \u2014 such as declining one payment from Vasquez and directing him to write checks to his company. Whitaker\u2019s office denied any wrongdoing. But it did acknowledge that one of its prosecutors made a mistake in withholding information that showed the FBI repeatedly paid Vasquez cash for his cooperation \u2014 information that came out weeks before trial and stunned the defense. Vasquez, who had filed for bankruptcy in 2001, testified at a pretrial hearing that he likely used some of the FBI money to buy drugs.\n\nA federal judge declined to dismiss the case, ruling that any problems with the prosecution didn\u2019t rise to the high bar needed to grant that remedy.\n\nAfter a nine-day trial, jurors returned their acquittal within two hours \u2014 including a long lunch break. McCoy\u2019s supporters cheered outside the courthouse. But by then, McCoy had exhausted all of his liquid assets paying for his defense.\n\nOne of his former attorneys, Marc Beltrame, recalled that some jurors felt so bad for McCoy\u2019s ordeal that they privately apologized afterward.\n\nThe case struck Iowa Democrats and some media observers as an abuse of power.\n\n\u201cWhy would the federal government contact, wire and pay an informant without checking him out \u2014 or, worse, despite knowing he was disreputable? It has all the earmarks of a politically motivated witch hunt,\u201d Des Moines Register columnist Rekha Basu wrote after the acquittal.\n\nWhitaker said in a statement later that he respected the outcome, saying: \u201cAll of the evidence was heard by the jury in open court and they have rendered their decision.\u201d\n\nMcCoy said that he continues to suffer from the reputational damage and is still paying off the $100,000 in legal fees he incurred fighting the charge. When he was considering a run for Congress last year in a seat a Democrat captured in Tuesday\u2019s election, a national publication brought his indictment back up in what he called a damaging story. He opted not to run for Congress and campaigned for the Polk County Board of Supervisors instead, ousting its longtime chairman in the Democratic primary earlier this year.\n\nMcCoy said he believes Whitaker pursued him in part because of his openly gay lifestyle. He noted that Whitaker was a keynote speaker while he was U.S. attorney at an event for the Christian Coalition, which opposes gay rights.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still carrying this around my neck \u2014 both the financial burdens as well as the emotional scars,\u201d he said. \u201cThis all happened so that Whitaker could have a political trophy on the wall and I was it.\u201d", "ALBANY, N.Y.

Burns\u2019 pass went to Kane at the edge of the right faceoff circle. Kane half-whiffed on the shot, but it went behind defenseman Julius Honka and slid past a screened Khudobin.\n\nThe Sharks tied it 1-all in the first period on Meier\u2019s 12th goal of the season.\n\nShore opened the scoring at 8:57 when Seguin passed to him in the left faceoff circle, and he lifted a wrist shot into the upper left corner.\n\nShore said it has helped him to play on a line with Seguin.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredible. He\u2019s a world-class talent and a big part of our team. When you get thrown on a line with a player like that, you try to play the same game and do what makes you a good player to complement him,\u201d Shore said.\n\nSeguin and Smith scored 45 seconds apart in the second period. Seguin intercepted a pass in the slot and fired a wrist shot past Jones at 6:57. On the next possession, passes by Miro Heiskanen and Jason Dickinson created an easy tip-in for Smith.\n\n\u201cThat was a strange game,\u201d San Jose coach Peter De Boer said. \u201cI liked our first period. Then I looked up, and we\u2019re down 3-1. We made some soft plays with the puck or poor decisions, and they\u2019re a team that can stick them in the back of the net. I liked our push, but if you score three you should be getting points.\u201d\n\nPavelski redirected a shot by Burns to get the Sharks to 3-2.\n\nNOTES: Meier moved into a tie for the NHL lead with his 12th goal. He has scored in 11 of 13 games (11 goals, five assists). ... Stars D John Klingberg left in the third period with an upper-body injury from blocking a shot.

(AP Photo/David Banks)\n\nCHICAGO (AP) \u2014 Jeremy Colliton\u2019s NHL coaching debut got off to a shaky start before the Chicago Blackhawks began skating with confidence and made it respectable.\n\nGoals by Andrei Svechnikov, Jaccob Slavin, Phillip Di Giuseppe and Calvin de Haan gave Carolina a four-goal lead early in the second period and the Hurricanes held on for a 4-3 victory over the Blackhawks on Thursday night.\n\nColliton became the 38th coach of the Blackhawks on Tuesday after Joel Quenneville was fired after 10 seasons with Chicago. Quenneville ranked second in NHL history with 890 regular-season victories.\n\nDespite the coaching switch, Chicago suffered through a sluggish, mistake-filled opening 25 minutes. The Blackhawks\u2019 winless streak reached six straight (0-5-1) after Colliton was promoted from Chicago\u2019s American Hockey League affiliate in Rockford, Illinois, to become the NHL\u2019s youngest head coach at 33\n\n\u201cWe looked like we were a bit tentative, especially in our own end, early on,\u201d Colliton said. \u201cI think there were some self-inflicted wounds.\n\n\u201cWe had things totally under control, no pressure and we turned it into a situation where they can come at us. These are things we can fix very quickly.\u201d\n\nPatrick Kane, David Kampf and Nick Schmaltz scored for the Blackhawks after they fell behind 4-0 in a quiet United Center, but the team\u2019s comeback came up just short.\n\nSchmaltz said he and his teammates were just thinking too much with a new coach behind the bench. So with Chicago trailing 3-0 after one period, Colliton\u2019s message was simple.\n\n\u201cHe just said, \u2018Don\u2019t think out there. Just play hockey. We know how to play hockey.

(AP) \u2014 Northwestern turned to its most seasoned players in an 82-52 win over New Orleans on Thursday night.\n\nVictor Law had 18 points, six rebounds and five assists. The redshirt senior, who was a key part of Northwestern\u2019s run to the NCAA tournament in 2017, passed 1,000 career points early in the game, becoming the 36th player in program history to top the plateau.\n\nRyan Taylor, a graduate transfer from Evansville, added 20 points, including six 3-pointers.\n\nLaw\u2019s known for his defensive prowess, but he showed off his versatility against the Privateers.\n\n\u201cHis whole career, since we recruited Vic, I\u2019ve always saw him as a jack-of-all-trades guy,\u201d said Northwestern coach Chris Collins. \u201cWhen he\u2019s at his best, he\u2019s impacting the game in every way, with defense, with rebounding, with playmaking, with shooting, with activity. I thought he showed that tonight.\u201d\n\nLaw acknowledged after the game he knew he was close to the milestone as his final season as a Wildcat started.\n\n\u201cDo you want me to lie to you or do you want me to tell you the truth?\u201d Law asked reporters. \u201cI knew! I wasn\u2019t going for it. I knew I was close. I knew if I played my normal game, if I played aggressive, everything would work itself out.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe team was unselfish. They figured out he had a hot hand, and I think what will make them a good team in this rugged Big Ten is that they were smart enough in game one to figure out he had a hot hand and get him the ball,\u201d said New Orleans coach Mark Slessinger.\n\nTaylor is one of two transfers on Northwestern\u2019s team. With four freshmen on the roster, the Wildcats (1-0) are still trying to figure some things out.\n\n\u201cIt took a while to get used to the offense. There\u2019s still things I struggle with.

The Wildcats have now christened the new court with a win in its season opener after spending a season playing at Allstate Arena, 14 miles away from campus.\n\nHE SAID IT: \u201cAll my guys have green lights. I\u2019m a fun guy to play for when it comes to that. You\u2019re not going to get yelled at for shooting the ball. I might get on you for lack of effort or not being a good teammate, or not being locked in to some of our game plan stuff, but I was a gunslinger when I played, and I want our guys to shoot freely. I want them to take their shots and be cocky, and all of them have a green light in that regard,\u201d Northwestern coach Chris Collins.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nNorthwestern started the season unranked, but with its highest-ranked recruiting class in school history.

And in between the Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback and his red-hot team put together systematic 52-21 dismantling of Carolina on Thursday night that left little doubt about their depth and their talent regardless of whether Le\u2019Veon Bell ever shows up for work or not.\n\nTen different Steelers touched the ball on offense. Six of them scored. None of them were named Bell. While the three-time Pro Bowl running back tweeted his thoughts from home while waiting \u2014 and waiting \u2014 to sign his one-year franchise tender, Pittsburgh ripped off its fifth straight victory with stunning ease.\n\n\u201cReally big performance against a really good team on a short week so there is a lot to be proud of,\u201d Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin said. \u201cBut we are probably not that good.\u201d\n\nMaybe not, but Pittsburgh (6-2-1) looked every bit the part of legitimate contender in the AFC, perhaps for the first time this season.\n\nRoethlisberger completed 22 of 25 passes for 328 yards and five touchdowns while posting a perfect quarterback rating of 158.3. James Conner, who has filled in capably during Bell\u2019s self-imposed sabbatical, ran for 65 yards and a score before being evaluated for a concussion late.\n\nAntonio Brown added eight receptions for 96 yards \u2014 including a 53-yard touchdown in the second quarter \u2014 to cap an eventful day that began with the star wide receiver being cited for reckless driving after police clocked Brown\u2019s Porsche driving over 100 mph down a busy highway in the northern city suburbs.\n\n\u201cThis is what we expected,\u201d Roethlisberger said. \u201cWe knew we were going to have to put up a lot of points. We did that. The defense, they were playing like their hair was on fire.\u201d\n\nBell has until next Tuesday to sign a contract if he wants to play this season. His teammates have long since tired of talking about Bell\u2019s status and at this point.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to comment on someone who\u2019s not in the locker room right now,\u201d Roethlisberger said.\n\nAnd why bother? For three hours on Thursday night Pittsburgh looked every bit as potent without Bell as it did with him. If he returns, they insist they\u2019ll welcome him with open arms. If he doesn\u2019t, they are intent on keeping the train rolling.\n\nThe Panthers (6-3) saw their three-game winning streak come to an abrupt halt in a city where they\u2019ve never won. Carolina fell to 0-4 all-time in Pittsburgh and was never really in it after the Steelers scored 21 points in the game\u2019s first 11 minutes.\n\nCam Newton completed 23 of 29 for 193 yards and a pair of flips to Christian McCaffrey that the second-year running back turned into scores, but Newton\u2019s showdown with Roethlisberger never materialized. The Steelers sacked Newton five times and rarely let him get comfortable. McCaffrey finished with 138 yards total offense (77 yards rushing, 61 yards receiving) and accounted for all three Panther touchdowns but it wasn\u2019t nearly enough.\n\n\u201cWe had a lot of our noses bleeding early on,\u201d Newton said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to stop it and keep things going in our favor. We just got outplayed today.\u201d\n\nNewton didn\u2019t help matters when he threw off his back foot out of the Carolina end zone while trying to avoid getting sacked in the first quarter. Pittsburgh linebacker Vince Williams raced under the floater and returned it 17 yards for a touchdown to give the Steelers a 14-7 lead they never came close to relinquishing.\n\nRoethlisberger\u2019s rainbow to Brown put Pittsburgh up 31-14 at the half and when Roethlisberger found Vance McDonald in the back on the end zone on the Steelers\u2019 first drive of the second half, the competitive portion of the evening was over. Pittsburgh\u2019s 52 points matched the most ever surrendered by the Panthers in franchise history. Carolina allowed the same total in a 52-9 loss to Oakland on Dec. 24, 2000.\n\n\u201cThey did some good things against us,\u201d Panthers head coach Ron Rivera said. \u201cWe made too many mistakes early on to give ourselves an opportunity to win a football game.\u201d\n\nREID TARGETS ROETHLISBERGER\n\nCarolina safety Eric Reid was ejected in the third quarter after being called for targeting when he dived at Roethlisberger\u2019s head as the Pittsburgh quarterback was sliding at the end of an 18-yard scramble.\n\n\u201c@Panthers Eric Reid was ejected for unnecessary roughness for forcible contact to the head and neck area of a sliding quarterback in #CARvsPIT.\u201d \u2013 AL pic.twitter.com/1MbDzjkrLK \u2014 NFL Officiating (@NFLOfficiating) November 9, 2018\n\nSeveral Steelers, most of them offensive linemen, took exception with the hit and a brief scrum ensued. Pittsburgh center Maurkice Pouncey said Roethlisberger offered to pay any fines the linemen may accrue for sticking up for him.\n\nReed, signed by Carolina in September, walked over to Roethlisberger and apologized before being escorted to the locker room.\n\n\u201cI understand the NFL is trying to protect quarterbacks but when they\u2019re running the ball they\u2019re running backs,\u201d Reid said. \u201cI\u2019m not thinking that \u2018It\u2019s Ben, don\u2019t tackle him.\u2019 There\u2019s a guy running with the ball so I\u2019m doing my job.\u201d\n\nPAYING TRIBUTE\n\nRoethlisberger and Newton both wore cleats during the pregame that paid tribute to the 11 members of the Tree of Life synagogue that were killed in a mass shooting last month. Roethlisberger\u2019s cleats featured the names of all 11 victims while Newton\u2019s cleats read \u201cHatred Can\u2019t Weaken a City of Steel.\u201d\n\nUP NEXT\n\nPanthers: Travel to Detroit on Nov. 18 to take on the Lions.

And don\u2019t ask which group first came up with its catchy phrase and odd rendering of the English language.\n\n\u201cWho Dey? I don\u2019t understand. I\u2019m baffled,\u201d says Saints running back Mark Ingram. \u201cIt\u2019s like, did they copy us? Or not? I don\u2019t know. Who Dat! Who Dat! Who Dat! ...\u201d\n\nWhat anyone might ask is whether the Saints (7-1), coming off three huge victories, including handing the Rams their first loss, are ripe for a letdown. Drew Brees and company face Philadelphia next week.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to be hungry coming off the bye week,\u201d Ingram says of the Bengals. \u201cThey have playoff aspirations. They have aspirations of winning their division. So every game is important to them just like it is to us. So we\u2019re going up there in foreign territory, hostile territory, and we\u2019ve got to go make it happen. We\u2019re a good team. We respect them but we\u2019re always worried about this building, this team, what we need to do to put ourselves in position to have success.\u201d\n\nIt might be difficult for New Orleans to find a way to lose this one, though. In the past three games, the Bengals (5-3) have given up 481 yards to Pittsburgh, then 551 to Kansas City and 576 to Tampa Bay.\n\nGranted, those are three of the NFL\u2019s top attacks. The Saints are up there, too, so if Cincinnati gives up 500 yards Sunday, it will become the first team to allow 500 in three consecutive games.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re underachieving right now,\u201d defensive end Carlos Dunlap admits. \u201cWe\u2019re playing well enough to win some games, which is why we\u2019re 5-3. If we work on the negatives, we can be that elite defense and that elite team.\u201d\n\nRight now, the eliteness is in the Big Easy\n\n\u201cThey go as Brees goes,\u201d Dunlap adds. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to find a way to slow down that future Hall of Famer.\u201d\n\nThe weekend began Thursday night with Pittsburgh\u2019s 52-21 home victory over Carolina. Ben Roethlisberger threw for 328 yards and five touchdowns to help the Steelers (6-2-1) win their fifth straight. The Panthers (6-3) had won three in a row.\n\nOff this week are Minnesota (5-3-1), Denver (3-6), Baltimore (4-5) and Houston (6-3).\n\nDallas (3-5) at Philadelphia (4-4)\n\nFor the Cowboys to stay real in the NFC East, they need a quick reversal of fortune. With four of those five losses coming on the road, a visit to the Linc isn\u2019t all that enticing.\n\nThese teams meet on \u201cSunday Night Football\u201d for the 10th consecutive season and 12th time overall. Dallas must find a passing game somewhere, and spring Ezekiel Elliott for some big plays, but the blocking unit has declined significantly.\n\nThe defending Super Bowl champion Eagles are 17-5 at home under coach Doug Pederson. Carson Wentz has thrown at least one TD with no more than one interception in 21 straight games, tied with Matt Ryan for the longest streak in NFL history. He has a new target in Golden Tate. The wideout was obtained from Detroit, for which he had eight catches for 132 yards and two TDs vs. the Cowboys on Sept. 30.\n\nSeattle (4-4) at Los Angeles Rams (8-1)\n\nComing off their first defeat, the Rams will remember they struggled to win 33-31 at Seattle last month. A victory would give LA a 4\u00bd-game edge in the NFC West and pretty much shut it down.\n\nBoth teams boast potent ground games, with the big star being LA\u2019s Todd Gurley. The Rams are No. 1 in the NFL with Gurley at 868 yards rushing; he also has 12 TD runs; he has scored in 12 consecutive games, the longest regular-season streak in team history.\n\nThe Seahawks are tops in rushing since Week 3 with 159.8 yards per game after concentrating more on the ground game following an 0-2 start.\n\nArizona (2-6) at Kansas City (8-1)\n\nThe Cardinals are 0-4-1 at Kansas City, and this isn\u2019t exactly the best time to be visiting. Arizona has the NFL\u2019s worst offense and ranks 31st in pass defense. All the Chiefs do, with Patrick Mahomes, Kareem Hunt, Travis Kelce and Tyreek Hill, is score, score and score some more.\n\nBut Cardinals star receiver Larry Fitzgerald could make some history. Fitzgerald needs 33 yards receiving to pass Terrell Owens (15,934) for second in NFL history. Fitz needs 14 receptions to pass Jerry Rice (San Francisco, 1,281) for the NFL record for receptions with one team.\n\nDetroit (3-5) at Chicago (5-3)\n\nA very lopsided series recently in favor of Detroit, which has won nine of 10. Indeed, Chicago hasn\u2019t won an NFC North game in its past 10 attempts.\n\nBut the Lions allowed 10 sacks \u2014 yes, 10 \u2014 to Minnesota last week, and Chicago has an even better defense than the Vikings.\n\nThe Bears also are decently balanced and rank fifth in scoring. Still, their calling card is on D, and they scored twice that way against Buffalo: Eddie Jackson\u2019s 65-yard fumble recovery and Leonard Floyd\u2019s 19-yard interception return.\n\nWashington (5-3) at Tampa Bay (3-5)\n\nThe Redskins were routed at home by Atlanta last weekend and lost three key players, including both starting guards. Adrian Peterson has three consecutive 100-yard rushing games against Tampa Bay, including last year with the Cardinals. Can he find room to roam behind a makeshift offensive line?\n\nTampa sure can pass and sure can score, but it often falls so far behind that it can\u2019t catch up. The Bucs have been outscored 103-27 in the first half of Ryan Fitzpatrick\u2019s past three starts, all losses.\n\nStill, Fitzpatrick has three games with four or more TD passes, the most in the NFC this season, and has been much better than erstwhile starter Jameis Winston.\n\nNew England (7-2) at Tennessee (4-4)\n\nHere we go again: New England is on a roll as Tom Brady makes everyone around him better.\n\nThe Patriots have won six straight (seven in a row overall against Tennessee). Brady will play in his 300th game, including postseason, and will join Brett Favre (326) as the only NFL quarterbacks to appear in 300 games. Brady needs three TD passes to tie Peyton Manning (579) for the most in NFL history, also including playoffs.\n\nTennessee comes off a solid victory at Dallas and coach Mike Vrabel had his biggest playing days in New England, where he won three titles.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just gotten ourselves to the surface where there\u2019s a little bit of air, a little bit of water,\u201d Vrabel says. \u201cYou\u2019re kind of taking a little bit of both in and you can\u2019t survive there for long. But you can survive there for a few minutes. And so we got to make the next decision to see if we can get our heads completely above water.\u201d\n\nAtlanta (4-4) at Cleveland (2-6-1)\n\nInjuries seemed to ruin the Falcons\u2019 season, yet here they are at .500 and with six games upcoming against teams currently owning losing records. Matt Ryan is having an outstanding year, even while overshadowed in the NFC South by Brees and Cam Newton.\n\nWith 13 yards receiving Sunday, Julio Jones will reach 10,000 in his career and become the fastest player to reach that milestone (104 games).\n\nThe Browns have dropped four straight, and are 0-1 under interim coach Gregg Williams. But their .786 winning percentage (11-3) against the Falcons is the team\u2019s highest against any opponent.\n\nLos Angeles Chargers (6-2) at Oakland (1-7)\n\nAnother guy not getting enough recognition for a superb passing season is Philip Rivers while Patrick Mahomes grabs the AFC West headlines. Playing the woeful Raiders shouldn\u2019t hurt Rivers\u2019 resume: He has completed 75 of 100 passes for 994 yards, six TDs and no INTs in his past three outings vs. Oakland for a 126.0 rating.\n\nPlus, the Chargers have won five straight for their best record at the season\u2019s midpoint since 2006.\n\nMeanwhile, the Raiders are such a mess that they have been outscored 55-3 over the past five quarters and are allowing a 113.9 passer rating, on pace for the worst in franchise history.\n\nMiami (5-4) at Green Bay (3-4-1)\n\nSomehow, the Dolphins are a wild-card contender despite being outgained by 704 yards and outscored by 38 points. Much of that can be attributed to the past three road games, in which they were outscored 107-47.\n\nOn the bright side, Miami ranks first with 15 interceptions, including four last week against the Jets.\n\nAaron Rodgers, of course, doesn\u2019t throw picks. Rodgers has thrown 15 touchdowns to one interception, leading the league with a 0.3 percent interception percentage. And RB Aaron Jones leads the NFL at 6.03 yards per carry.\n\nJacksonville (3-5) at Indianapolis (3-5)\n\nTwo 3-5 marks that look much different. Jacksonville has dropped four in a row and is among the most disappointing clubs in football. Indy is giving a decent accounting of itself despite a lack of talent.\n\nThere\u2019s plenty of skill at quarterback, however. Andrew Luck, who missed 2017 with a shoulder injury, is back in fine form and has not been sacked in his past 154 pass attempts dating to the second offensive play against New England on Oct. 4. It\u2019s the longest stretch of his pro career.\n\nColts K Adam Vinatieri will be honored for breaking the NFL\u2019s career scoring record two weeks ago at Oakland. Vinatieri needs one win to tie George Blanda (209) for most regular-season wins in league history.\n\nBuffalo (2-6) at New York Jets (3-6)\n\nWith all that record scoring throughout the league, this could be an 8-5 snoozer.\n\nSam Darnold has regressed behind center for the Jets and now has a foot injury. But let\u2019s be fair: Darnold has very little help, especially with versatile RB Bilal Powell on IR. Last year\u2019s starter, veteran QB Josh McCown, steps in.\n\nAs for Buffalo, well, maybe getting rid of Tyrod Taylor wasn\u2019t such a wise move.\n\nNew York Giants (1-7) at San Francisco (2-7), Monday night\n\nThis isn\u2019t likely to be as much of a sleep-inducer as Bills-Jets. At least a national TV audience gets to watch Saquon Barkley, the most dynamic rookie to hit New York since Odell Beckham Jr. \u2014 and without all the baggage.\n\nSan Francisco has its own intriguing story after rookie QB Nick Mullens tore up Bay Area rival Oakland last week. Mullens joined Hall of Famers Jim Kelly and Fran Tarkenton as the only players with at least 250 yards passing, three TDs and no INTs in his career debut.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Joe Kay and Brett Martel contributed to this report.\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "SALT LAKE CITY (AP) \u2014 Blending in tons of newcomers isn\u2019t going to happen without Utah experiencing some growing pains.\n\nThat much was evident during the Utes\u2019 75-61 victory over Maine on Thursday night. Utah showed moments of brilliance in its season opener. It also made plenty of mistakes characteristic of a young and inexperienced basketball team.\n\n\u201cGot to be better defensively. Got to stick to the game plan. Got to take better care of the ball,\u201d senior guard Sedrick Barefield said, checking off the areas where he feels like the Utes need to improve.\n\nUtah seemed ready to cruise to an easy win after the Utes opened the game by connecting on their first seven field-goal attempts and started 9 of 10 from the field. That run of baskets included six 3-pointers.\n\nThen Utah got a taste of the other end of that spectrum in the second half when it endured a scoring drought lasting more than nine minutes. The Utes weren\u2019t as successful in getting stops and Maine threw out a 1-1-3 zone that helped the Black Bears hang around.\n\n\u201cTypically, in an overall sense, if (we) get stops, we\u2019re a pretty good team,\u201d Utah coach Larry Krystkowiak said. \u201cNot just because we didn\u2019t let the other team score, but because we have some guys that can get out and run and do some things in transition and the offensive end isn\u2019t such a grind.\u201d\n\nBarefield scored 18 points and Donnie Tillman added 15 to lead Utah. The Utes (1-0) prevailed after shooting 49 percent from the field and finishing with a 42-26 advantage on the glass.\n\nIsaiah White scored 24 points and Terion Moss added 13 to lead the Black Bears (0-2). Maine trailed wire-to-wire after shooting just 40 percent.\n\nHot shooting out of the gate resulted in a quick double-digit lead for the Utes.\n\nAfter White turned a steal into a fastbreak dunk to cut Utah\u2019s lead to 14-8, Barefield responded with back-to-back 3-pointers to push the advantage back to double digits. Vante Hendrix followed with two more baskets on consecutive possessions a minute later. Hendrix\u2019s second basket \u2014 a 3-pointer he set up with a steal \u2014 put Utah up 25-10 with 12:16 left in the first half.\n\nMaine cut the deficit to 10 twice before halftime.\n\nTimmy Allen made a layup and fed Riley Batten to set up another to give Utah a 45-28 halftime lead.\n\nThe aforementioned nine-minute cold spell for Utah\u2019s offense prevented the Utes from building on the lead after halftime. It allowed Maine to pull within 60-51 on a 3-pointer from Moss with 6:09 left.\n\n\u201cI was extremely pleased with our toughness, in terms of how we continued to fight, even when we made some mistakes mentally, we moved onto the next play really well,\u201d Maine coach Richard Barron said.\n\nBarefield finally ended the drought with a jumper. Utah then ran off four straight baskets, culminating in a Parker Van Dyke 3-pointer to take a 71-57 lead with 2:44 remaining.\n\nWHITE SHINES\n\nAfter averaging 11.1 points a year ago, White may be on the cusp of playing a bigger part in Maine\u2019s offense this season. The redshirt junior scored a career-high 24 points while also matching a career-high with nine field goals. White is the leading scorer for the Black Bears through two games, averaging 16.5 points on 43 percent shooting.\n\nNEW FACES\n\nNine new players joined Utah during the offseason and six of them made their debut with the Utes on Thursday. The top performers among the newcomers were graduate transfer Novak Topalovic and true freshman Allen. Topalovic totaled nine points and nine rebounds. Allen had six points, six boards, and six assists.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nMaine: The Black Bears should get a boost of confidence from hanging around with Utah in the second half. Their shooting was a bit too erratic in the first half to truly give them an upset chance, but they could put a scare into other opponents during their six-game road trip with improvement.\n\nUtah: Inconsistency gripped a Utah team filled with newcomers. The Utes were solid on defense as usual, but endured long cold spells on offense. There could be some growing pains for Utah as the schedule gets tougher, but the Utes do have enough length, speed, and athleticism to be a dangerous team once they have enough experience.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nMaine: The Black Bears continue a season-opening six-game road trip at San Francisco on Saturday.\n\nUtah: The Utes will hit the road for the first time when they play at Minnesota on Monday.\n\n____\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "", "Carolina Hurricanes right wing Andrei Svechnikov (37) scores a goal on Chicago Blackhawks goaltender Corey Crawford (50) during the first period of an NHL hockey game Thursday, Nov. 8, 2018, in Chicago.

(AP Photo/Bullit Marquez, File)\n\nMANILA, Philippines (AP) \u2014 A Philippine court found former first lady Imelda Marcos guilty of graft and ordered her arrest Friday in a rare conviction among many corruption cases that she plans to appeal to avoid jail and losing her seat in Congress.\n\nThe special anti-graft Sandiganbayan court sentenced Marcos, 89, to serve 6 to 11 years in prison for each of the seven counts of violating an anti-corruption law when she illegally funneled about $200 million to Swiss foundations in the 1970s as Metropolitan Manila governor.\n\nNeither Marcos nor anyone representing her attended Friday\u2019s court hearing.\n\nMarcos said in a statement that the decision was being studied by one of her lawyers who notified the Marcos family that he intends to appeal the decision. Anti-Marcos activists and human rights victims welcomed the conviction as long overdue.\n\nThe court disqualified Marcos from holding public office, but she can remain a member of the powerful House of Representatives while appealing the decision. Her congressional term will end next year but she has registered to run to replace her daughter as governor of northern Ilocos Norte province.\n\n\u201cI was jumping up and down in joy in disbelief,\u201d said former Commission on Human Rights chairwoman Loretta Ann Rosales, who was among many activists locked up after Imelda\u2019s husband, former President Ferdinand Marcos, declared martial law in the Philippines in 1972.\n\nRosales said the decision was a huge setback to efforts by the Marcos family to revise history by denying many of the atrocities under the dictatorship, and urged Filipinos to fight all threats against democracy and civil liberties.\n\nFormer Sen. Aquilino Pimentel Jr., who was also jailed during the Marcos dictatorship, said it was up to voters in next year\u2019s May 13 local elections, where Marcos is a candidate, if they want \u201csomebody who has a bad name representing them, that\u2019s your call.\u201d\n\nImelda Marcos\u2019 husband was ousted by an army-backed \u201cpeople power\u201d revolt in 1986. He died in self-exile in Hawaii in 1989 but his widow and children returned to the Philippines. Most have been elected to public offices in an impressive political comeback.\n\nGovernment prosecutor Ryan Quilala told reporters that Marcos and her husband opened and managed Swiss foundations in violation of the Philippine Constitution, using aliases in a bid to hide stolen funds. The Marcoses have been accused of plundering the government\u2019s coffers amid crushing poverty. They have denied any wrongdoing and have successfully fought many other corruption cases.\n\nImelda Marcos was acquitted Friday in three other cases, which were filed in 1991 and took nearly three decades of trial by several judges and prosecutors. She was once convicted of a graft case in 1993, but the Supreme Court later cleared her of any wrongdoing.\n\nPresident Rodrigo Duterte, an ally of the Marcoses, said last year the Marcos family had indicated a willingness to return a still-unspecified amount of money and \u201ca few gold bars\u201d to help ease budget deficits. He indicated the family still denied that the assets had been stolen as alleged by political opponents.\n\nFerdinand Marcos had placed the Philippines under martial rule a year before his term was to expire. He padlocked Congress, ordered the arrest of political rivals and left-wing activists and ruled by decree. His family is said to have amassed an estimated $5 billion to $10 billion while he was in power.\n\nA Hawaii court found Marcos liable for human rights violations and awarded $2 billion from his estate to compensate more than 9,000 Filipinos who filed a lawsuit against him for torture, incarceration, extrajudicial killings and disappearances.\n\nDuterte has acknowledged that Imee Marcos, the couple\u2019s daughter and a provincial governor, backed his presidential candidacy.", "Wake Forest's Ja'Cquez Williams (30) celebrates with his team after defeating North Carolina State in an NCAA college football game in Raleigh, N.C., Thursday, Nov. 8, 2018.

(AP) \u2014 Everything seemed aligned against Wake Forest: The Demon Deacons had a quarterback making his first start, an injury-depleted defense facing an offense peppered with future NFL players, and trailed by 10 points in the fourth quarter in a stadium where they almost never win,\n\nYet No. 22 North Carolina State couldn\u2019t seal the victory, so Wake Forest snatched it away.\n\nJamie Newman threw a 32-yard touchdown pass to Jack Freudenthal with 30 seconds left to give Wake Forest a 27-23 upset victory Thursday night.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just about staying poised, honestly,\u201d Newman said. \u201cStaying poised and being smart, not letting the moment get too big for you.\u201d\n\nMaking his first career start, Newman was 22 of 33 for 297 yards with three touchdown passes in the second half to help the Demon Deacons (5-5, 2-4 Atlantic Coast Conference) rally from a 10-point deficit in the fourth quarter. The 19 1/2-point underdogs earned their first road victory over a Top 25 team in a decade.\n\n\ud83c\udfe0 CALL!!@WakeFB comes up CLUTCH against #NCState in the final moments for the 2nd-straight year!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJack Freudenthal with the game-winning TD!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(@J_Freudenthal) #GoDeacs \ud83c\udfa9 pic.twitter.com/ps879SFbQn \u2014 ACC Digital Network (@theACCDN) November 9, 2018\n\n\u201cThis was going to be a game that we just have to grind, and grind, and grind, and somehow find a way to win,\u201d coach Dave Clawson said. \u201cAnd to our kids\u2019 credit, they did it. Every time that that thing was on the brink of getting away from us, we just did one thing to stay in it.\u201d\n\nNewman threw a 38-yard scoring pass to Alex Bachman before his 19-yard TD to Greg Dortch pulled Wake Forest to 23-20 with 6:07 left.\n\nN.C. State bled nearly 4 1/2 minutes off the clock before its drive stalled at the Wake Forest 20 with 1:39 left. Newman completed 5 of 8 passes on the possession that followed, taking a hit as he connected with Freudenthal \u2014 who was wide-open after Bachman blocked two defenders \u2014 over the middle for the go-ahead score.\n\n\u201cWe were in the huddle, and we said, \u2018We\u2019ve just got to go,\u2019\u201d Freudenthal said.\n\nThe Wolfpack advanced to their own 49 before Ryan Finley\u2019s final pass for the end zone was intercepted by receiver Scottie Washington \u2014 playing defensive back on the last play \u2014 to end it.\n\nFinley finished 35 of 52 for 374 yards with a 35-yard touchdown pass to Emeka Emezie and a 2-yard touchdown run for the Wolfpack (6-3, 3-3, No. 14 CFP). The pass to Emezie put them up 23-13 one play into the fourth quarter.\n\nAfter losing three of four to fall out of contention in the Atlantic Division, they\u2019ll only reach their goal of the school\u2019s first 10-win season since 2002 if they win out and win their bowl game.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nWake Forest: Maybe a third straight bowl berth isn\u2019t out of the question for the Demon Deacons, who hadn\u2019t beaten a nationally ranked opponent on its home field since knocking off No. 24 Florida State in 2008 and had won in Raleigh only once in their previous 16 tries. This didn\u2019t look at all like the same Wake Forest team that was routed by No. 3 Notre Dame and No. 2 Clemson.\n\nN.C. State: This one is going to sting the Wolfpack, who settled for three short field goals after drives stalled deep inside the red zone \u2014 twice at the 6-yard line, once at the 12. They also finished with a season-worst 47 yards rushing against the ACC\u2019s worst run defense, and on a drive that was supposed to bleed the clock, they rushed for minus-6 yards on three carries while relying heavily on Finley\u2019s throwing.\n\n\u201cI take responsibility any time my team doesn\u2019t play the way that it can, and I do,\u201d coach Dave Doeren said. \u201cWe had a lot of opportunities, and there (are) a lot of things that happened throughout the course of the game that led to the result.\u201d\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\n\nThe Wolfpack\u2019s return to the AP Top 25 figures to be short-lived. N.C. State dropped out of the poll after losing two weeks ago at Syracuse, climbed back in following their rout of Florida State and seems likely to drop right back out.\n\nKEY STATS\n\nThe Wolfpack averaged just 1.7 yards per carry \u2014 also a season worst \u2014 while Wake Forest had 11 tackles for losses, including four sacks. N.C. State fell to 1-3 when it averages fewer than 3.5 yards per carry.\n\nSTRATEGY SHIFT\n\nThe Demon Deacons are usually one of the fastest-playing teams in the country, averaging more than 85 plays per game. But the quarterback change and the lack of depth on defense forced Clawson to slow things down. They ran only 71 plays in this one. \u201cIf we do what we normally do ... there\u2019s no way we hold them to 23 points,\u201d Clawson said.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nWake Forest: Returns home to play host to Coastal Division leader Pittsburgh on Nov. 17.\n\nN.C.

The new plaque and wreath help explain the meaning of the dog tags and acknowledge Britain's contribution and sacrifice. (AP Photo/Steven Senne)\n\nBOSTON (AP) \u2014 The British are coming again \u2014 this time in friendship.\n\nA memorial honoring fallen soldiers from the U.S. and Britain is being dedicated this month, and the venue couldn\u2019t be more ironic: Boston\u2019s historic Old North Church, where the American Revolution pitting rebellious colonists against English troops basically began.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the one place in Boston where you wouldn\u2019t expect this to happen,\u201d said Simon Boyd, a British-born real estate executive and Royal Air Force veteran leading the initiative.\n\nOn April 18, 1775, two lanterns were displayed from the steeple of the church \u2014 a prearranged signal from Paul Revere that the British were heading to Lexington and Concord by sea across the Charles River rather than by land. That event, immortalized in Henry Wadsworth Longfellow\u2019s epic poem, \u201cPaul Revere\u2019s Ride,\u201d ignited the war of independence from Britain.\n\nBut Old North Church, Boston\u2019s oldest surviving house of worship and the city\u2019s most-visited historical site, since has become a symbol of Anglo-American affection.\n\nEvery year on the Sunday closest to Nov. 11 \u2014 the date World War I ended in 1918 \u2014 the church built in 1723 has held a special remembrance service for Britons living in or near Boston, complete with bagpipes and poppies. This year\u2019s commemoration will fall precisely on the 100th anniversary of the bloody Great War\u2019s end.\n\nSince 2005, Old North Church also has hosted a touching tribute to American troops killed in Iraq and Afghanistan. In the courtyard of the church, jingling like wind chimes, hang nearly 7,000 blank military dog tags \u2014 one set of tags for every U.S. life lost.\n\nThe new memorial, a bronze wreath, will honor British and other Commonwealth forces who perished alongside U.S. forces in both campaigns. And a bronze plaque will explain the meaning of the dog tags to the hundreds of thousands of visitors who pause to pay homage each year while walking Boston\u2019s Freedom Trail \u2014 a 2.5-mile (4-kilometer) route that takes visitors past the church, Revere\u2019s house and other historic landmarks.\n\n\u201cWe once were enemies, but we\u2019ve long since gotten over that,\u201d said the Rev. Stephen Ayres, vicar of Old North Church. \u201cWe\u2019re now a go-to church for the British community in Boston. That\u2019s part of the improbability and wonder of Old North.\u201d\n\nBruce Brooksbank, the Iraq-Afghanistan memorial\u2019s volunteer caretaker, remembers how soldiers in the 1960s and \u201970s were disrespected when they returned home from Vietnam.\n\n\u201cThis is my own little chance to make amends,\u201d he said.\n\nFittingly, two top soldiers from both countries will join forces on Nov. 17 to unveil the wreath and plaque, both paid for by The Soldiers Fund, a Boston-based nonprofit that supports U.S. and British soldiers, veterans and their families.\n\nRetired Gen. Martin Dempsey, a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff under President Barack Obama who now oversees USA Basketball, and retired Gen. Sir Mike Jackson, who held the highest post in the British Army from 2003-2006 and now is president of Britain\u2019s Army Benevolent Fund, will preside over the unveiling. Both will speak at a Soldiers Fund dinner in Boston that evening.\n\nThere\u2019s another tie that binds, said Boyd, who chairs the board of the Soldiers Fund: In 1917, Massachusetts sent one of the largest U.S. regiments to fight in WWI, naively dubbed \u201cthe war to end all wars.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re commemorating British and American lives lost, at a church where Paul Revere said with his lanterns that the British were coming,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s really all kind of come full circle.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Bill Kole on Twitter at https://twitter.com/billkole.", "WACO, Texas (AP) \u2014 Kalani Brown scored 23 points, freshman NaLyssa Smith had her first double-double with 21 points and 10 rebounds and No. 4 Baylor trailed briefly in the middle of the first quarter before rolling to a 116-58 victory over Saint Francis of Pennsylvania on Thursday night.\n\nChloe Jackson had 17 points, six assists and four steals for the Lady Bears (2-0), who won a second straight game against an overmatched opponent that reached the NCAA Tournament last season before losing to a No. 1 seed.\n\nJess Kovatch scored 15 points for the Red Flash (0-2), whose 12th NCAA appearance ended in the first round against UConn last season.

(Fred Chartrand/The Canadian Press via AP)\n\nOTTAWA, Ontario (AP) \u2014 In the midst of a so-so sophomore season, the Golden Knights finally scored in bunches.\n\nWilliam Carrier put Vegas ahead for good after Ottawa rallied from a three-goal deficit, and the Golden Knights beat the Senators 5-3 on Thursday night.\n\nVegas, which reached the Stanley Cup final in its inaugural season but has hovered around .500 so far in this campaign, scored more than three goals in regulation for the first time since Oct. 16, a span of nine games.\n\n\u201cWe played a real good game,\u201d coach Gerald Gallant said. \u201cThe puck finally went in the net for us so that was a real key for us to get five goals. We\u2019re happy with that.\u201d\n\nJonathan Marchessault, Shea Theodore, Nick Holden and Pierre-Edouard Bellemare also scored for the Golden Knights. Marc-Andre Fleury made 27 saves.\n\nMatt Duchene, Ryan Dzingel and Thomas Chabot scored for the Senators, who fell behind 3-0 late in the second period before coming back to tie it in the third. Craig Anderson stopped 37 shots.\n\nTrailing 3-1 to start the third, Ottawa scored twice in just over a minute to make it 3-3. Dzingel scored at 6:57, and Chabot converted into a wide-open net as Fleury was caught sprawling.\n\nVegas regained the lead about a minute later as Carrier won a battle along the boards, stepped around Mark Borowiecki and beat Anderson stick side.\n\nBellemare got the final goal into a wide-open net after Anderson got tangled with Carrier. The Senators challenged unsuccessfully for goaltender interference, a call that infuriated coach Guy Boucher, who said he isn\u2019t sure what constitutes interference anymore.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know anymore,\u201d Boucher said. \u201cAll of us together, we just don\u2019t know anymore.

If it\u2019s one goal, it might have been different.\u201d\n\nVegas dominated much of the second period and took a 3-0 lead late when Holden jumped into the play and lifted the puck over Anderson\u2019s right shoulder. It was the well-traveled defenseman\u2019s first goal for Vegas.\n\nOttawa finally solved Fleury 29 seconds later when the goalie poke-checked Chabot and the puck went right to Duchene. Mike Stone picked up an assist, extending his point streak to five games.\n\n\u201cI thought we did some really good things,\u201d Duchene said. \u201cObviously when you tie it 3-3 in the third, it can go either way. We had the momentum, so tough way to lose.\u201d\n\nDuchene\u2019s goal came after Borowiecki accepted a challenge from Ryan Reaves to drop the gloves.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a couple high hits on our team the last couple weeks,\u201d Reaves said. \u201cEverybody knows that if you\u2019re going to do that, you\u2019re going to have to answer the bell. Good on him for answering the bell, not a lot of guys will do that, but good on him.\u201d\n\nThe Knights got two power-play goals in the first period. Marchessault opened the scoring 15 minutes in, and with 20 seconds remaining, Theodore fired a puck from just inside the blue line through traffic and past Anderson.\n\nNOTES: Senators rookie Brady Tkachuk returned after missing the previous nine games with a torn ligament in his left leg.

He plays at both ends of the floor, and played really good defense tonight. He\u2019s tough. I\u2019m just really thrilled for him and satisfied presently for what he\u2019s done. You can tell he\u2019s going to be special.\n\n\u201cIn the first half he was the only one hitting.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Wieskamp wasn\u2019t surprised by his debut, having been with the team since June and working out daily to get his game college-ready.\n\nThe former Mr. Basketball for the state of Iowa preached confidence as the reason for his steadiness in the opener.\n\n\u201cAny time you make your first shot, you know it\u2019s going to be a good game,\u201d Wieskamp said. \u201cMy teammates and coaches have the utmost confidence in me, and so that confidence carries over. I know I can score the ball and do a lot of things to help this team win, and that\u2019s what I tried to do.\u201d\n\nThe Hawkeyes got 12 points from Jordan Bohannon, as well as 12 points, eight rebounds and five assists from Tyler Cook.\n\nIowa had a 34-26 lead at halftime after shooting just 32 percent from the field and 29.4 percent from 3-point range against a UMKC squad that lost 76-45 to Loyola-Chicago in its opener. McCaffery said it was shot selection in particular that frustrated him as far as his team\u2019s offense. Despite a definite size advantage, the Hawkeyes took more 3-pointers than 2-pointers.\n\n\u201cIn the first half we took 17 3s and eight 2-point shots,\u201d McCaffery said. \u201cI was really disappointed in that aspect.

Their opener came against Loyola-Chicago (a Final Four team last season) and next up is UConn.\n\nTHE FEELING IS MUTUAL\n\nOn Jack Nunge\u2019s decision to redshirt, McCaffery said he tries as a head coach to never force a player into a redshirt situation, and was happy with how Nunge came to his choice this season.\n\nWith a clogged rotation and an ability to improve greatly over the next year, McCaffery said he\u2019s excited about what the possibilities are with this buffer season.\n\n\u201cI support him,\u201d McCaffery said. \u201cI think it makes a lot of sense. We tried last year to squeeze six guys into four spots and it didn\u2019t work. I think Jack saw that. I think Jack Nunge has a chance to be special \u2014 really special.\n\n\u201cHe struggled at times (last year), and you\u2019re going to see a guy come back next year probably in the 245 (pound) range. He\u2019s going to go to work right now.\u201d\n\nNO DOUBT\n\nWieskamp\u2019s debut wasn\u2019t a surprise to him, and it wasn\u2019t a surprise to his teammates either. When asked about the freshman\u2019s game, Dailey gave a laugh before being succinct in his assessment.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been doing that since he got on campus, so it was nothing new for us,\u201d Dailey said.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nIowa hosts Green Bay on Sunday at Carver-Hawkeye Arena in the Hawkeyes\u2019 second preliminary game for the 2K Empire Classic.\n\nUMKC heads to Storrs, Connecticut, to face UConn on Sunday, marking the Kangaroos\u2019 third consecutive road game to start the season.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "NACOGDOCHES, Texas (AP) \u2014 Freshman Oddyst Walker made a free throw in the final two seconds as Stephen F.

Osaka is headed for big money with both Japanese and global appeal. Among companies vying to cash in on her stardom is Tokyo-based Citizen Watch Co. Its 80,000 yen ($700) Naomi Osaka watch is selling out after it got a lot of exposure on her wrist at the U.S. Open, where she beat Williams. (AP Photo/Andres Kudacki, File)\n\nTOKYO (AP) \u2014 Naomi Osaka used a powerful forehand and a matching serve to win the U.S. Open against Serena Williams. Off the court \u2014 on the marketing front \u2014 experts say she could have the same potential as Williams, and maybe more.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very, very rare to find a Japanese-born female athlete who appeals to an international audience,\u201d said Bob Dorfman, a sports marketing expert and creative director at Baker Street Advertising in San Francisco, California.\n\nSerena Williams topped the Forbes list of the highest-earning female athletes this year at $18 million, almost all endorsements.\n\nExperts say Osaka could be the right woman in the right sport at the right time with the draw to overtake her.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s more, tennis, especially women\u2019s tennis, is a sport that lends itself to a broad variety of sponsors: sporting goods, health and beauty, fashion, lifestyle, travel, personal care, you name it,\u201d Dorfman said. \u201cAnd the sport\u2019s international following brings with it a large, loyal and affluent fan base. All the more reason why so many companies are lining up to sign her up.\u201d\n\nThe big question is: Can she keep this up?\n\nMuch has happened very quickly for her, notes former tennis star Chris Evert.\n\n\u201cYou know, it\u2019s going to be life-changing for her and very, very important,\u201d Evert said. \u201cFrom what I see, she is very humble and from what I see, her parents are very humble people. Hopefully they won\u2019t go Hollywood on us. We don\u2019t want that to happen.\u201d\n\nOsaka\u2019s multicultural background \u2014 Japan-born but raised in the U.S. by a Haitian-American father and a Japanese mother \u2014 adds to her wide appeal, endearing her to fans in Japan and elsewhere.\n\nHer disarming charm, off and on the court, including how she handled the turmoil surrounding her win over Williams, is also winning people over.\n\n\u201cShe appeals to the young and old, men and women, everyone,\u201d said Shigeru Tanaka, advertising manager at Citizen, her sponsor since August.\n\nTokyo-based Citizen Watch Co.\u2019s 80,000 yen ($700) Naomi Osaka watch is selling out at stores in Japan, thanks to the exposure it got on her wrist at the U.S. Open.\n\nCitizen was quick to take advantage of her Grand Slam win, taking out a one-third page ad in the Yomiuri newspaper\u2019s extra edition report of her win.\n\nCompanies won\u2019t say how much her contracts are worth, but they tend to be written so that if she keeps winning, her earnings will keep going up. If one company won\u2019t pay, another will just snatch her up, marketing experts say.\n\nAlthough Japanese baseball players like Ichiro and Shohei Ohtani are superstars, that sport doesn\u2019t have the global appeal of tennis. There are Olympians, but their appeal tends to come and go every four years.\n\nJapan is \u201cjust starving for a star,\u201d Evert said.\n\nOsaka has been wearing various Citizen watches in matches and in photo ops and has told reporters the first watch she got from her mom was a Citizen. She has also said her father drove a Nissan while she was growing up \u2014 another in a growing line of sponsors.\n\nBesides Citizen, Osaka has deals with instant noodle-maker Nissin Foods Group, Japanese badminton and tennis racket maker Yonex Co., and athletic-wear and sneaker giant Adidas.\n\nNissan Motor Co. signed Osaka as its three-year \u201cbrand ambassador\u201d in September. The deal was in the works for a while, but the timing couldn\u2019t have been better, coming right after the U.S. Open.\n\nThe Yokohama-based automaker is mulling a \u201cNaomi Osaka model\u201d car. She is also getting keys to a silver GT-R sports car. Investing in Osaka enhances brand image for the long-term, said Masao Tsutsumi, general manager in charge of Osaka-related marketing at Nissan.\n\nHe said her transformation from \u201cevery girl\u201d to superstar parallels the automaker\u2019s commitment to technological innovation. \u201cShe also is such a nice person while being utterly professional,\u201d he added.\n\nYonex has been supplying rackets to Osaka since she was 10, after receiving a letter from her mother. The Osaka effect is evident in the growing popularity of Yonex rackets among younger Americans, the company says.\n\nAppearing before Yonex employees in Tokyo, Osaka drew affectionate laughter by insisting on addressing the crowd in Japanese, though she managed only a few words, including \u201conaji,\u201d or \u201cthe same,\u201d says Nori Shimojo, the company\u2019s official in charge of tennis player service.\n\nAt just 21, Osaka\u2019s got plenty of time to learn the language of her birthplace if she wants to.\n\nAs for her sponsorship windfall, she is shrugging it all off.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t really know because I have never been in this territory,\u201d she said during a recent tournament in Singapore. \u201cFor me, I just focus on my matches, and, I mean, like I\u2019m a tennis player, so I just play tennis.\u201d\n\n___\n\nSandra Harwitt in Singapore contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nYuri Kageyama is on Twitter at https://twitter.com/yurikageyama\n\nOn Instagram at https://www.instagram.com/yurikageyama/?hl=en", "Boston Bruins left wing Jake DeBrusk (74) celebrates his goal as Vancouver Canucks defenseman Michael Del Zotto (4) reacts during the second period of an NHL hockey game Thursday, Nov. 8, 2018, in Boston.

(Hong Hae-in/Yonhap via AP)\n\nSEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 A fire that likely blocked a crucial exit at a low-cost dormitory-style housing facility in central Seoul killed at least seven people and injured 11 others on Friday, according to fire authorities who were investigating possible safety lapses in the building.\n\nThe blaze has been extinguished, but it\u2019s possible that the death toll could rise, officials at the Seoul Metropolitan Fire and Disaster Headquarters said.\n\nThe fire probably started near an exit door on the building\u2019s third floor, Kwon Hyeok-min, chief of Seoul\u2019s Jongno District Fire Station, told reporters. The facility\u2019s residents were mostly manual laborers who made their living on day-to-day jobs, he said.\n\n\u201cIt was dawn and the exit door was likely blocked, so it would have been difficult (for the residents) to escape,\u201d Kwon said.\n\nAnother official from the Jongno station said the facility, which was built in 1983, did not have sprinklers because current safety regulations can\u2019t be retroactively applied to older structures. The official, who didn\u2019t want to be named, citing office rules, said it was unclear whether the building\u2019s smoke detector worked.\n\nThe facility, called \u201cgoshiwon\u201d in Korean, is where poor workers relying on construction jobs or student preparing for bar exams or civil service exams stay in individual rooms with tiny sleep and study spaces. Budget travelers also often stay in such facilities.\n\nSouth Korean media reported that most of the victims were manual laborers in their 40s to 60s. The fire agency couldn\u2019t immediately confirm the reports. It wasn\u2019t known whether any young students or travelers were staying there.\n\nThe facility was located on the second and third floors of a three-story building, where the fire agency said all the victims were found. Its first floor has restaurants.\n\nSouth Korea, one of Asia\u2019s richest economies, has struggled for decades to improve safety standards and change widespread attitudes that treat safety as subservient to economic progress and convenience.\n\nForty-six people died in January when a fire ripped through a small hospital with no sprinkler systems in the southern city of Miryang. It was the country\u2019s worst fire since 2008, when 40 people died at a refrigerated warehouse in Icheon, near Seoul. Twenty-nine people were killed in a building fire in Jecheon in December of last year.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Kim Tong-hyung contributed to this report.", "FILE - In this Sept. 24, 2018, file photo, members of the Korean K-Pop group BTS attend a meeting at the U.N. high level event regarding youth during the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly, at U.N. headquarters.

Whitaker, who on Wednesday became the nation\u2019s top law enforcement official after President Donald Trump named him acting attorney general.\n\nThe case against McCoy fell apart in court amid allegations of political bias and prosecutorial misconduct. A jury quickly acquitted McCoy of the criminal charge, deciding that he had not attempted to extort money from a former business partner.\n\nIn an interview Thursday, McCoy said he was shocked by Whitaker\u2019s elevation to lead the Justice Department. He said his case should serve as a warning that Whitaker will not hesitate to pursue Democrats and Trump\u2019s desire to curtail special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation.\n\nWhitaker said in a statement on Wednesday that he is \u201ccommitted to leading a fair Department with the highest ethical standards, that upholds the rule of law, and seeks justice for all Americans.\u201d Trump said on Twitter that Whitaker \u201cwill serve our Country well.\u201d\n\nMcCoy faced prosecution when Whitaker was a George W. Bush appointee serving as the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Iowa based in Des Moines. Democrats have alleged that it was one of several prosecutions of local officials brought during the Bush years that were tainted by political considerations \u2014 an allegation that Whitaker has denied.\n\nWhitaker announced at a news conference in March 2007 that a grand jury had charged McCoy with attempted extortion by an elected official, an offense that carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. He alleged that McCoy demanded and accepted $2,000 in payments from a businessman seeking to obtain a waiver to sell home security products for the elderly to Iowa\u2019s Medicaid program, threatening to block state business if he wasn\u2019t paid.\n\nWhitaker\u2019s office and the FBI spent months building a case against McCoy after Thomas Vasquez, a salesman with a history of financial, domestic and substance abuse problems, alleged that McCoy was trying to shake him down. Vasquez later agreed to be a paid informant, recording several conversations with McCoy and making what prosecutors called \u201cbribe payments\u201d to McCoy with money supplied by the FBI.\n\nMcCoy argued the indictment was based on out-of-context snippets of 12 hours of recorded conversations, and that his actions had an innocent explanation that his legal team shared with Whitaker early on.\n\nIn addition to being a senator, McCoy operated a consulting business. He said Vasquez, an acquaintance he met through Alcoholics Anonymous, had asked him to help market the security products as a consultant and he agreed. They signed a contract in which McCoy would be paid $100 for each unit sold. Vasquez went to the FBI after their relationship soured. McCoy said that he later accepted payments from Vasquez because he believed that he was following through with their deal.\n\nHis lawyers argued that Whitaker\u2019s office committed prosecutorial misconduct by not playing for the grand jury parts of the recordings that were exculpatory \u2014 such as declining one payment from Vasquez and directing him to write checks to his company. Whitaker\u2019s office denied any wrongdoing. But it did acknowledge that one of its prosecutors made a mistake in withholding information that showed the FBI repeatedly paid Vasquez cash for his cooperation \u2014 information that came out weeks before trial and stunned the defense. Vasquez, who had filed for bankruptcy in 2001, testified at a pretrial hearing that he likely used some of the FBI money to buy drugs.\n\nA federal judge declined to dismiss the case, ruling that any problems with the prosecution didn\u2019t rise to the high bar needed to grant that remedy.\n\nAfter a nine-day trial, jurors returned their acquittal within two hours \u2014 including a long lunch break.

But by then, McCoy had exhausted all of his liquid assets paying for his defense.\n\nOne of his former attorneys, Marc Beltrame, recalled that some jurors felt so bad for McCoy\u2019s ordeal that they privately apologized afterward.\n\nThe case struck Iowa Democrats and some media observers as an abuse of power.\n\n\u201cWhy would the federal government contact, wire and pay an informant without checking him out \u2014 or, worse, despite knowing he was disreputable? It has all the earmarks of a politically motivated witch hunt,\u201d Des Moines Register columnist Rekha Basu wrote after the acquittal.\n\nWhitaker said in a statement afterward that he respected the outcome, saying: \u201cAll of the evidence was heard by the jury in open court and they have rendered their decision.\u201d\n\nMcCoy said that he continues to suffer from the reputational damage and is still paying off the $100,000 in legal fees he incurred fighting the charge. When he was considering a run for Congress last year in a seat a Democrat captured in Tuesday\u2019s election, a national publication brought his indictment back up in what he called a damaging story. He opted not to run for Congress and campaigned for the Polk County Board of Supervisors instead, ousting its longtime chairman in the Democratic primary earlier this year.\n\nMcCoy said he believes Whitaker pursued him in part because of his openly gay lifestyle. He noted that Whitaker was a keynote speaker while he was U.S. attorney at an event for the Christian Coalition, which opposes gay rights.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still carrying this around my neck \u2014 both the financial burdens as well as the emotional scars,\u201d he said. \u201cThis all happened so that Whitaker could have a political trophy on the wall and I was it.\u201d", "Brendan Kelly speaks with reporters outside his home, as he shows his Route 91 tattoo, Thursday, Nov. 8, 2018, in Thousand Oaks, Calif.

Two of his friends were among those killed.\n\nChandler Gunn, 23, told The Los Angeles Times that a friend who survived the Vegas shooting works at the bar. When Gunn learned about the shooting, he rushed to Borderline.\n\nGunn said his friend, whose name he didn\u2019t provide, escaped safely out the back.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s people that live a whole lifetime without seeing this, and then there\u2019s people that have seen it twice,\u201d he said.\n\nIn social media posts, Molly Mauer said she was at Borderline and also survived Vegas.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m saying this again. I\u2019m alive and home safe,\u201d she said on Facebook.\n\nIn Las Vegas and Thousand Oaks, country music fans were the victims. Borderline features country music, and Wednesday was \u201ccollege night\u201d that drew many young people to the bar. The Last Vegas shooter targeted a crowd of country music fans gathered for the Route 91 Harvest Festival.\n\nKelly has a large tattoo on his left arm memorializing the Las Vegas shooting, which killed 58 people. On his other arm Thursday, he still had his wristband from the California bar.\n\nWhen the Las Vegas gunman opened fire from a 32nd-floor hotel room, Kelly said he threw a friend to the ground before helping get her out of the area and into a room. Armed with a knife in case an attacker came in, he hunkered down and waited with 40 other people for four hours.\n\nHe said living through Vegas changed his life. He doesn\u2019t know how a second mass shooting will affect him down the road.\n\n\u201cEverywhere I go, everything I do is affected,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t sit in a room with my back to the door.

(AP Photo/Rich Pedroncelli, File)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 As Nancy Pelosi wrangles votes in her bid for House speaker, another leadership battle is playing out on the Republican side, where Kevin McCarthy faces a challenge from conservative Freedom Caucus co-founder Jim Jordan to lead the new GOP minority.\n\nRepublicans lost the House majority in this week\u2019s midterm elections, and conservatives are blaming the GOP establishment and angling for changes. McCarthy burned up the phone lines Thursday shoring up his support. And down ballot, the GOP will add a familiar name to the leadership lineup \u2014 Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, a daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney who announced her bid for the No. 3 GOP leadership spot.\n\nBut the bigger battle continues to play out on the other side, where Democrats hold a slim majority, now at 225 seats. That leaves Pelosi little room for error as she rounds up the 218 votes needed to become the first woman to reclaim the speaker\u2019s gavel.\n\nPelosi\u2019s opponents said they were mobilizing Thursday and discussing writing a letter to show there are enough votes to block her from becoming speaker. Foes have tried to oust Pelosi before. But this time, they say their effort could show some two dozen new and returning House Democrats who won\u2019t give her their vote. On the campaign trail, several candidates said they\u2019d oppose her.\n\n\u201cWe have enough,\u201d said Rep. Kurt Schrader, D-Ore., one of those who described the effort.\n\nThe group was still deciding whether to draft the letter or state their case in person to Pelosi when House Democrats meet privately in the days ahead, he said. \u201cIf you add in all the recently elected members who have said they\u2019re not voting for Pelosi in our opening salvo, the math isn\u2019t there. She doesn\u2019t have the votes,\u201d Schrader said.\n\nPelosi\u2019s allies quickly swatted back the claim as exaggerated. She said this week she\u2019s confident she\u2019ll be speaker, and even got a boost from President Donald Trump, who said he\u2019d like to work with her. Several House races remain undecided, and her hold on the majority could grow if other Democrats are elected.\n\n\u201cLeader Pelosi is confident in her support,\u201d said spokesman Drew Hammill.\n\nAllies point out her opponents actually lost ground Thursday in a separate effort to challenge her leadership by revising the caucus rules for House Democrats.\n\nCongress returns next week to begin sorting out new leadership after eight years of Republican power. Closed-door sessions of voting for leadership positions will set the stage for the speaker\u2019s election in January, when the new members of Congress take their first votes.\n\nOn the GOP side, McCarthy, the House majority leader who is close to Trump, is favored for the top spot in the minority, but he has struggled to shore up support from the GOP\u2019s right flank of lawmakers. They have been skeptical of the California Republican and questioned his conservative bonafides. Some would prefer to elect a street fighter who will confront Pelosi\u2019s Democrats in the new House majority.\n\nTrump signaled he\u2019d be happy with McCarthy, but he\u2019s also promoted Jordan, the Ohio Republican, who is a regular on Fox News and popular with conservative groups beyond Washington.\n\nOn Thursday, McCarthy was calling colleagues, pledging to fight Democrats and win back the majority.\n\nMcCarthy promised \u201cto use every tool at our disposal to deliberately challenge House Democrats\u201d and protect Trump\u2019s agenda. In a letter to colleagues, he acknowledged losing the majority was \u201cdifficult\u201d and said the road ahead would be hard. \u201cI expect us to win back the House.\u201d\n\nTo become minority leader, McCarthy would need support from half the Republicans in the House. Their tally now stands at 197, but some races remain undecided. Jordan is expected to pick up support from dozens of members.\n\nJordan\u2019s bid remains a longshot, but he\u2019s making inroads into leadership for the Freedom Caucus, whose members want a seat at the table. His supporters outside the Capitol are revving up to support him.\n\n\u201cAre you going to elect the same people who lost the election, or are you going to elect someone new?\u201d asked Adam Brandon, president of the conservative group FreedomWorks, which announced its support Thursday for Jordan.\n\nIf McCarthy and Jordan both fall short, Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the GOP whip who was seriously wounded in last year\u2019s shooting at a congressional baseball team practice, could swoop in. For now, he\u2019s running to keep his position as vote counter.\n\nWhile Jordan, a former college wrestling champ, is seen as the brawler needed, his bid may be complicated by allegations this summer that, as an assistant wrestling coach at Ohio State University years ago, he did not do enough to counter claims of sexual abuse by the team doctor, who has since died. Jordan has denied knowing of any allegations of wrongdoing.\n\nHe\u2019s not the only Republican leader with baggage. Scalise has had to distance himself from an appearance in Lousiana by a group with ties to David Duke, a former leader of the Ku Klux Klan. Scalise has said he was unaware of the link.\n\nCheney, meanwhile, will run for conference chair, now held by Washington GOP Rep.

(AP Photo/John Raoux, File)\n\nCLEVELAND (AP) \u2014 The Cavaliers are losing games and players at an alarming rate.\n\nStarting point guard George Hill could miss two weeks with a sprained right shoulder, the latest setback for the Cavs, who have won just one game and are expected to be without All-Star forward Kevin Love for at least another five weeks following foot surgery.\n\nCleveland is also missing forward Sam Dekker, who sprained his ankle and is out for a month.\n\nHill was a late scratch before Wednesday night\u2019s loss to Oklahoma City. The 32-year-old, who hurt his shoulder on the final possession of Monday\u2019s loss in Orlando, went through his usual pregame workout, but was experiencing pain in his shoulder and couldn\u2019t play against the Thunder. Further medical tests performed Thursday revealed the sprain.\n\nHill\u2019s setback is yet another obstacle for the Cavs, who are an NBA-worst 1-10 and recently fired coach Tyronn Lue.

But the 65-year-old cashed out this year, driven away by plunging prices, insider trading scandals, a cooling economy and a tariff war with Washington.\n\n\u201cInvestors should get out,\u201d said Lu, watching flickering prices on a wall-mounted display at a Beijing brokerage. \u201cI am here just for fun and not to make money.\u201d\n\nPresident Xi Jinping\u2019s government is struggling, with limited success, to dispel such gloom and talk stock prices back up with promises of tax cuts, more bank lending and a media campaign led by its economy czar.\n\nThe benchmark Shanghai Composite Index sank 30 percent from January through mid-October. Prices fell so far that China gave up its status as the No. 2 market by share value after the United States and dropped to third place behind Japan. The index has gained 5 percent since late October but is the world\u2019s worst performer this year.\n\nThe slump adds to challenges for communist leaders as they try to shore up economic growth and carry on a tariff war with U.S. President Donald Trump over Beijing\u2019s technology policy.\n\nIt also puts a kink in plans for state industry to use share sales to pay down a multibillion-dollar mountain of debt and modernize.\n\nChina\u2019s markets are unusual among large countries. Created to raise money for state industry, they have a growing number of private firms but still are dominated by government companies such as oil giant PetroChina Ltd. and China Mobile Ltd., the world\u2019s biggest phone carrier.\n\nPrices react to policy changes instead of economic performance. Conditions abroad have little influence because Chinese markets are kept walled off from global financial flows. A handful of U.S. and European financial firms have been granted the status of domestic investors since 2002 but the main class of \u201cA\u2033 shares is off-limits to most foreign investors.\n\nThe latest price slide began in January after Beijing clamped down on bank lending to rein in surging debt.\n\nShares in real estate and other companies that thrive on credit were hit hard. Aluminum Corp. of China, a major building materials supplier, tumbled 52 percent. China Vanke Co., a developer, is off 40 percent.\n\nThe economic downturn brought on by credit controls was more abrupt than Chinese leaders wanted, prompting them to reverse course and tell banks to lend more. They promised tax cuts and other help after economic growth slumped to a post-global crisis low of 6.5 percent over a year earlier in the three months ending in September.\n\nBut the impact of those measures has yet to show up in economic data.\n\n\u201cMarket sentiment has remained very weak,\u201d UBS economists said in a report.\n\nThe slump drove university student Shao Xinyu to the sidelines less than a year after he started buying stocks.\n\nShao, from the central city of Zhengzhou, invested 30,000 yuan ($5,000) from his savings and gifts from his parents. The market plunge slashed the value of that stake by one-third.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t invest more,\u201d said Shao, 21. \u201cI need to wait to see how the economy and the market develop.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s stock markets have ridden a boom-and-bust roller coaster since 1990, when the first exchange since the 1949 communist revolution opened in Shanghai. A second exchange followed the next year in Shenzhen, near Hong Kong.\n\nPrices soared and slumped in 2001, 2008 and again in 2015.\n\nDespite that, small investors piled into stocks.\n\nThe number of individual Chinese trading accounts nearly quintupled between 2006 and 2017, hitting 192 million, according to the Shanghai Stock Exchange\u2019s annual report.\n\nBrokerages opened trading rooms where small investors with jars of tea and bundles of financial newspapers perched on plastic seats in front of wall-mounted price monitors. Today, most of those have closed as trading shifted online.\n\nThree-quarters of Chinese trading accounts are worth less than 500,000 yuan ($71,000), according to the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, and most traders have a few thousand dollars invested, buying shares directly instead of using mutual funds.\n\nLu, the retired salesman, said he started out 15 years ago with 10,000 yuan ($1,500) and turned that into 100,000 yuan ($15,000) before selling most of his shares.\n\nIndividual investors owned about 21 percent of the market as of the end of 2017, or shares worth 5.9 trillion yuan ($842 billion), according to the Shanghai exchange. Galaxy Securities, a brokerage, says about 30 percent of that, or 1.9 trillion yuan ($271 billion), was in mutual funds.\n\nInvestors already were skittish after the 2015 price collapse. Then, Beijing plowed billions of dollars into stopping the slide and suspended plans for stock offerings by state-owned companies.\n\nConfidence took another hit after a wave of arrests of brokerage executives, a star Chinese trader and a former market regulator on charges of insider trading and manipulating prices.\n\nLi Jun, a retired hotel chief executive in the eastern city of Nanjing, said his nest egg of 300,000-400,000 yuan ($40-$60,000) in stocks was cut in half by the market routs in 2008 and 2015.\n\n\u201cI avoid putting in more money, because what is the use of doing that?\u201d said Li, 81.\n\nRegulators have tried in vain to encourage investors to shift from rapid-fire trading to holding for the long term. The Shanghai exchange said individual investors accounted for 82 percent of its daily trading volume in 2017, little changed from previous years.\n\nInstead, regulators are gradually allowing in more foreign buyers in hopes they will provide ballast as long-term investors.\n\nSince 2014, foreigners have been able to buy some \u201cA\u2033 shares through Hong Kong. In July, regulators announced foreigners working in China would be given access to the whole market.\n\nNow, investors worry about a possible new downward spiral if prices of shares pledged as collateral by companies for loans fall far enough that banks and brokerages might seize and sell them to recover their money.\n\nThe government tried to allay those fears by announcing on Oct. 19 that Chinese insurers would be allowed to create units to buy such shares temporarily to keep them from flooding the market.\n\nThe same day, officials led by Vice Premier Liu He, Xi\u2019s top economic adviser, launched a media campaign to talk prices back up. The central bank governor, Yi Gang, was quoted as saying \u201ceconomic fundamentals are good.\u201d Liu said cheaper stocks created \u201cgood investment opportunities.\u201d\n\n\u201cI welcome the government\u2019s efforts to support the markets,\u201d said Li, the retired hotel executive. \u201cBut as for whether that is effective, I really don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nThe Shanghai index gained 4 percent after the ruling party leadership promised Oct. 31 to \u201cintensify reform.\u201d That prompted expectations of further easing in lending controls.\n\nXi followed with a Nov. 1 speech that promised tax cuts and other help to entrepreneurs that generate new jobs and wealth. Private sector analysts saw that as an affirmation of the importance of private business amid complaints state industry is a drag on the economy.\n\nThe latest measures helped to reassure Liu Fei, a manager at a Shanghai real estate company. She stuck with the market after losing 40 percent of her money in the 2015 crash but said her faith was waning.\n\n\u201cA week ago, I panicked and felt the Chinese stock market was finished,\u201d said Liu, 28. \u201cBut I gained confidence after the government issued supporting policies.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP researcher Yu Bing contributed to this report.", "", "MEDFORD, Ore.

I\u2019m on to (the Rams).\u2019\u201d\n\nThe incompletion was the most difficult moment the second-year wide receiver has faced since becoming part of Seattle\u2019s wide receiver rotation. The Seahawks had an untimed down from the 6-yard line needing a touchdown and a 2-point conversion to force overtime.\n\nQuarterback Russell Wilson stepped up away from the pass rush and Moore had flashed open running across the back of the end zone.\n\nWilson zipped his pass in Moore\u2019s direction, but just a couple of yards away from finding the receiver\u2019s hands, the ball was tipped by the Chargers\u2019 Jahleel Addae. The tip slightly changed the trajectory of the pass and it started severely wobbling offline. Moore was unable to adjust his hands in time and the ball thudded off his shoulder pads and to the turf.\n\n\u201cI (saw) it get tipped. I saw the dude come across and I tried to adjust to it but it was a little bit too late,\u201d Moore said. \u201cIt was a fastball coming in hot, getting touched, it\u2019s kind of hard to get your hands where it needs to be after that.\u201d\n\nMoore said he spent time Sunday night wondering if there are even drills to mimic having a pass change as that one did so close to the receiver.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really tough catch. He\u2019s tracking the ball, he sees it coming and all of a sudden the ball takes kind of a strange turn,\u201d Seattle offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer said. \u201cHe was really dejected, really upset. Got a chance to talk to him after the game, said a lot of things still had to happen. That wasn\u2019t the reason we won or lost that game, but it was a very difficult play.\u201d\n\nMoore\u2019s development has been one of the big stories of the season for Seattle. His progression from an unknown seventh-round pick in 2017 to becoming the Seahawks\u2019 No. 3 receiver was so rapid Seattle felt comfortable releasing veteran Brandon Marshall last week to open a roster spot.\n\nWhile it wasn\u2019t a dropped pass, the final play is the first major adversity Moore has faced this season. He was emotional after the game, but said the moment was quickly put in perspective.\n\n\u201cAt first I took it kind of hard, but then I had Doug (Baldwin) and Tyler (Lockett) and all the brothers and stuff, and all the coaches tell me stuff like this happens all the time,\u201d Moore said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "FILE - In this July 18, 2018, file photo, lawyers and youth plaintiffs lineup behind a banner after a hearing before Federal District Court Judge Ann Aiken between lawyers for the Trump Administration and the so called Climate Kids in Federal Court in Eugene, Ore.

(Aaron Lavinsky/Star Tribune via AP, File)\n\nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 Minnesota has a first team all-conference player coming back with Kenisha Bell, along with Big Ten Freshman of the Year award winner Destiny Pitts and four of the top five scorers from a team that finished 24-9 last season and won an NCAA Tournament game.\n\nWhen the Gophers start their schedule Friday night in front of a packed house, though, the fans will be most excited to see the head coach.\n\nLindsay Whalen will take the court with her new team in the opener against New Hampshire, one of the most-anticipated debuts in women\u2019s college basketball this year. Three months after announcing her retirement from the WNBA, Whalen has begun her full-time focus on the program she once helped build .\n\n\u201cI always hoped at some point I would work my way back here. You just don\u2019t know in what timing or in what capacity, so I\u2019m just really thankful and really appreciative of the opportunity and the timing for it all to work out,\u201d Whalen said before practice Thursday afternoon.\n\nThe Gophers, who were the first team to miss the cut in the preseason Associated Press Top 25 poll, have naturally been looking forward to this lid-lifter with more eagerness than usual.\n\nThe game on the elevated floor at 90-year-old Williams Arena was declared a sellout more than two weeks ago, with an expected crowd around 14,000. Though demand was boosted by steeply discounted tickets offered by the university to help spur sales, the heart of the buzz undoubtedly revolves around the beloved Whalen who first began putting fans in the seats 18 years ago as a freshman point guard who played with as much ferocity as flash.\n\nFour of the five largest crowds in program history came during Whalen\u2019s senior season, including the all-time record of 14,363 to see Penn State on Feb. 8, 2004.\n\n\u201cIt always felt full, but to have that true sellout, it was just such a good memory and such an unbelievable feeling as a player that I\u2019m just so excited that they get to experience that and they get to experience what it\u2019s like to play in this arena with all of its history,\u201d Whalen said. \u201cThis is a place that, as a kid growing up in Minnesota, I just wanted to come and watch games here. I never dreamt that I would play here. So for me to have them get to experience this is really special.\u201d\n\nWith a Big Ten Player of the Year Award, a trip to the NCAA Final Four, four WNBA titles and two Olympic gold medals with the U.S. national team, Whalen has plenty of accomplishments with which to command respect from the players. There\u2019s no better way to build their trust, though, than with relatability.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to talk to her for her to understand the things that we\u2019re going through as players,\u201d Bell said.\n\nFor some fun at the end of a recent practice, each player tried a half-court shot. They all missed. So Whalen stepped in.\n\n\u201cShe was like, \u2019All right, let me just do it for you,\u201d Bell said. \u201cSo she grabbed the ball and went to half court. Her first try, she made it.\u201d\n\nAlways the natural, that Whalen.\n\n\u201cWhen I played I was never going to be the fastest one or have the best jump shot, but I knew I was always going to be one of the toughest players in the gym no matter what,\u201d she said. \u201cI was going to do everything for my team to win. So I want us to have that edge and toughness where we\u2019re all in this together and are going to figure out a way to get this done.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball coverage: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "", "CARLSBAD, Calif. (AP) \u2014 Major League Baseball and its players\u2019 union likely will not decide until the eve of spring training whether to change rules in an effort to increase action on the field next year.\n\nDeputy Commissioner Dan Halem said Thursday as the annual general managers\u2019 meetings ended that there was no consensus for change yet. More discussions will take place when owners gather next week in Atlanta, the union\u2019s executive board convenes in late November and major league executives go to Las Vegas for the winter meetings in mid-December.\n\nTopics being discussed include the increased use of defensive shifts, the decrease in innings thrown by starting pitchers and technology that aids sign stealing. A possible 20-second pitch clock and alterations to rules for waivers, trade deadlines and disabled lists also are being talked about by a tradition-bound sport resistant to change.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re an entertainment product. Certainly, we want to play the game in a way that\u2019s compelling for our audience, including the younger audience,\u201d Halem said. \u201cWe\u2019re constantly looking at the way the game is changing organically and trying to balance the competitive issues with our clubs and our GMs doing everything possible to win versus what those decisions result in in terms of the product on the field. And it\u2019s not an easy balance, but we work very hard at it.\u201d\n\nAgreement with the union is necessary for playing rules changes, but management has the right to unilaterally implement a new playing rule with one year advance notice. Commissioner Rob Manfred had the right to mandate pitch clocks for 2018 but backed off when the union refused to agree, and he retains the ability to order clocks for 2019.\n\nMLB did initiate limits on mound trips without pitching changes in 2018, and the average time of a nine-inning game dropped to 3 hours, 44 seconds during the regular season from 3:05:11 in 2017 \u2014 although it rose to 3:34:50 this postseason from 3:29:28 in 2017.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going in the right direction,\u201d Halem said.\n\nNon-playing rules changes require agreement with players. Halem called the situation fluid, said he isn\u2019t certain when management and the union will meet and set spring training as the deadline to determine any actions.\n\nManfred has said the sport is examining whether it should attempt to manage the evolution of on-field play in an era when strikeouts topped hits for the first time in 2018 and the big league batting average dropped to its lowest level since 1972, the last season before the American League adopted the designated hitter. Strikeouts have set records for 11 straight years as more pitchers throw harder and teams more frequently bring in relievers.\n\n\u201cI think the commissioner has said we\u2019d probably like to see more balls in the play,\u201d Halem said.\n\nThere was just one trade announced during the four-day session: Seattle acquired speedy outfielder Mallex Smith from Tampa Bay as part of a five-player trade that sent catcher Mike Zunino and outfielder Guillermo Heredia to the Rays.\n\nMost general managers said their focus is winning under the current rules.\n\n\u201cI just react to whatever\u2019s happening and do everything I can to try to put our team in position to score more runs than the other team,\u201d Los Angeles Dodgers president of baseball operations Andrew Friedman said. \u201cI can understand from a fan perspective the increase in strikeouts obviously then decreases the action in a game and how that can be something that\u2019s not landing well right now \u2014 and I totally appreciate that.\u201d\n\nAgent Scott Boras on Wednesday attributed the 4 percent attendance drop this year to the decisions by several teams to jettison veterans in favor of rebuilding \u2014 which cuts the money spent on contracts for players, including his clients.\n\n\u201cI certainly don\u2019t agree with that characterization,\u201d Halem said. \u201cI don\u2019t and our owners don\u2019t believe that there\u2019s any connection between the rebuilding process and overall attendance. There are a variety of reasons for our attendance numbers. We had poor weather,\u201d\n\nThere were 54 postponements, the most since 1989, and 26 were higher-drawing weekend games. Manfred said 35 games in April had a temperature of 40 degrees or less.\n\n\u201cA lot of people like the way the game is being played right now. Other people would like to see more balls in play,\u201d Halem said. \u201cSo on any of these issues I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a right answer. And some of these trends may be cyclical, too, and will reverse themselves, because our clubs are very competitive, and as soon as one club starts doing something that\u2019s successful, reducing their strikeout rate as a team, for example, then other clubs follow.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "", "", "PHOENIX (AP) \u2014 Paul Goydos and Tim Petrovic shot 8-under 63 on Thursday to share the lead in the Charles Schwab Cup Championship, leaving points leader Bernhard Langer seven strokes back in the PGA Tour Champions\u2019 season finale.\n\nIn sunny, 80-degree conditions at Phoenix Country Club, Langer parred the final nine holes for a 70.

Daniels is still working hard to become the elite passer many expected to see in his freshman season.

Daniels is determined to have a big finish that could still get USC back to the Pac-12 title game. (AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill, File)\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 J.T. Daniels is mentally and physically weary as he heads into the home stretch of his freshman season, which he realizes hasn\u2019t been the smashing success many Southern California fans anticipated.\n\nThe 18-year-old quarterback won\u2019t stop until he becomes the passer he knows he can be. He\u2019s still grinding and learning every day, from the practice field to the film room and back.\n\nWhen asked why he puts in so many hours of video study, Daniels shines a frank light on his skills and his determination to improve them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not as good as someone like Sam Darnold, just to be straight-up,\u201d Daniels said this week after practice for the Trojans\u2019 (5-4, 4-3 Pac-12) visit from California (5-4, 2-4) on Saturday night.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t do what a guy like Sam can do,\u201d Daniels added. \u201cFor me, if I\u2019m going to succeed, I know that I have to be the most prepared to know what\u2019s going to happen. I\u2019m also not the tallest guy, so I can\u2019t see everything that\u2019s happening at all times. I just have to know, based off preparation and film study, who\u2019s going to be where, and I have to know where I\u2019ve got to put the ball.\u201d\n\nDaniels arrived at USC several months ago amid fanfare and excitement for the next great quarterback in the Trojans\u2019 enviable lineage. After a phenomenal high school career in Orange County, he graduated a full year early to compete for Darnold\u2019s job, and he won it in training camp.\n\nWith three games left in the regular season, Daniels is eighth in the Pac-12 with 1,788 yards passing, and he has just nine touchdown passes against seven interceptions. His 125.2 passer rating is below every Pac-12 team\u2019s top passer except UCLA\u2019s Dorian Thompson-Robinson, and his 56.6 completion percentage is 13th in the league.\n\nDaniels\u2019 numbers are inextricable from the USC offense\u2019s struggles as a whole. Quarterbacks coach Bryan Ellis still sees every bit of Daniels\u2019 vast potential, even if the offense\u2019s performance hasn\u2019t reflected it yet.\n\n\u201cI think what he\u2019s learned is college football is a little faster and a little harder than he thought it was going to be,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cHe learned that he\u2019s still a freshman, that we are still making freshman mistakes. We\u2019ve learned we\u2019ve got a long way to go. We\u2019ve got a lot of work to do.\u201d\n\nDaniels was sidelined by a concussion last month at Utah, missing the rest of that defeat and a loss to Arizona State the following week. He returned for last week\u2019s win at Oregon State, and he didn\u2019t allow the injury to slow his weekly quest for constant improvement.\n\nHe hasn\u2019t cut down on his voracious film study, either.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the hardest-working quarterback in the film room I\u2019ve ever been around, and that\u2019s as an 18-year-old kid, which is really, really impressive,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cI think he just enjoys it. He\u2019s a football junkie. He knows that he\u2019s got some things to learn, some things to get better at, but he\u2019s doing it every day to get ready to be a really good quarterback.\u201d\n\nDaniels is far from the only USC offensive player with work to do. Last week, head coach Clay Helton took over the Trojans\u2019 play-calling and fired his offensive line coach, shaking up an underachieving unit that sits ninth in the Pac-12 in yards passing and 10th in yards rushing.\n\nDaniels is likely to be without key receiver Michael Pittman Jr. against the Golden Bears, adding another degree of difficulty to the Trojans\u2019 fall slate. After their crosstown showdown with UCLA at the Rose Bowl next week, USC finishes the regular season against No. 3 Notre Dame.\n\nThe Trojans could still reach the Pac-12 title game, or they could miss a bowl entirely with an 0-3 slump. Daniels\u2019 performances will have a big influence on that finish, and he is determined to play beyond his years.\n\n\u201cI guess I\u2019m just so into it right now,\u201d Daniels said. \u201cYou\u2019re coming into the home stretch and your body is tired, your mind is tired. You could really use a break, but you\u2019re not going to get a break. ... It\u2019s a big stage, but I\u2019m doing my best.

(AP Photo/Nell Redmond)\n\nTAMPA, Fla. (AP) \u2014 DeSean Jackson\u2019s frustration grows by the loss.\n\nThe Tampa Bay Buccaneers have dropped five of six games following a 2-0 start, and the veteran receiver doesn\u2019t want anyone to buy the notion that all it\u2019ll take to make him happy is to catch more passes Sunday against the Washington Redskins.\n\nThe Bucs (3-5) haven\u2019t made the playoffs since 2007, and the only way to change that trend is to start winning.\n\nJackson, who signed with Tampa Bay as a free agent in 2017 after spending the previous three seasons with the Redskins, thinks he can make a difference. He fielded questions this week for the first time since he reportedly asked to be traded last month.\n\n\u201cWhatever them conversations were, they were between us,\u201d Jackson, when asked if he approached general manager Jason Licht before the Oct. 30 NFL trade deadline.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s over and done with now, and I\u2019m looking forward,\u201d the five-time 1,000-yard receiver added. \u201cWe\u2019ve got eight games left to continue to try our best to get in the playoffs and win here.\u201d\n\nThe 11th-year pro has rebounded from a subpar debut with Tampa Bay a year ago to average 22.4 yards per reception in 2018.\n\nBut since beginning the season with consecutive 100-yard performances, that included TD catches of 58 and 75 yards in victories over New Orleans and Philadelphia, the 31-year-old\u2019s production has curtailed.\n\nThrough eight games, Jackson has 28 catches for 626 yards and four touchdowns, including a 60-yard scoring reception against Cincinnati that gave him the most TDs of 60-plus yards (24) in NFL history.\n\nAt the risk of sounding selfish, Jackson concedes he would like to be more involved in the offense. He began his career in Philadelphia, where he had three 1,000-yard seasons in six years. He had two in three seasons with the Redskins.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just knowing what\u2019s in this locker room, knowing the players we have all across the board. ... That\u2019s been more of the frustration for me,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cIt\u2019s not individual. It\u2019s more (about) accomplishing what we all want to accomplish.\u201d\n\nThe NFC East-leading Redskins (5-3) are coming off a lopsided loss to Atlanta that snapped a three-game winning streak.\n\nBouncing back on the road doesn\u2019t figure to be easy after losing three starters \u2014 receiver Paul Richardson and guards Brandon Scherff and Shawn Lauvao \u2014 to season-ending injuries against the Falcons.\n\nAlex Smith is coming off throwing for a season-best 306 yards last week, and coach Jay Gruden is counting on leading rusher Adrian Peterson\u2019s skill and experience to help him to adjust to changes of the offensive line and continue to be productive.\n\n\u201cHe just goes through his reads like he normally would. It doesn\u2019t matter who\u2019s blocking for him \u2014 at guard, center, tackle, tight end, fullback ... or receiver,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cHe\u2019s just going to go through his progressions and make his cuts and do what he does.\u201d\n\nSome things to know about the Redskins and Buccaneers:\n\nNICE TO MEET YOU\n\nAfter placing Scherff and Lauvao on injured reserve Monday because they need season-ending surgeries, and with left tackle Trent Williams recovering from an operation on his right thumb, the Redskins are putting together a makeshift offensive line. They signed three unemployed linemen \u2014 tackle Austin Howard, along with guards Jonathan Cooper and Luke Bowanko \u2014 and at least one is expected to start Sunday.\n\n\u201cThe big thing, I think, is on the road, crowd noise, against a good D-line,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI think those things, all the calls, all the communication that has to take place \u2014 run, pass, third down \u2014 all the different looks, the thousands and thousands of reps that we\u2019ve had \u2014 you try to condense into a few days to get ready.\u201d\n\nFITZMAGIC\n\nRyan Fitzpatrick will make his sixth start of the season at quarterback for the Bucs, who benched Jameis Winston after a road loss to Cincinnati two weeks ago. Tampa Bay has been outscored 103-27 in the first half of Fitzpatrick\u2019s past three starts \u2014 all losses.\n\nLike Smith, Fitzpatrick is in his 14th season. Smith was the first pick in the 2005 draft. Fitzpatrick was a seventh-round pick, No. 250 overall.\n\n\u201cHe was 249 picks before I was,\u201d Fitzpatrick said, \u201cbut we\u2019re both still here.\u201d\n\nCAN PETERSON BOUNCE BACK?\n\nPeterson entered this week fifth in the league in rushing with 604 yards at age 33, but he is coming off a poor game: He only ran nine times for 17 yards in the loss to Atlanta. Things might not be easy with a reconstructed O-line.\n\n\u201cI always say: The play looked great in practice when you draw it up and you run through it at practice. But when you\u2019ve got guys coming at 100 mph, things change,\u201d Peterson said.\n\nNO COMEBACKS YET\n\nThe Redskins have not managed to win a game in which they\u2019ve trailed this season. And during Gruden\u2019s 4\u00bd years in Washington, the team only has 15 come-from-behind victories; only five clubs have fewer in that span.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s something that we have got to do a better job of,\u201d Gruden said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "EAST LANSING, Mich.

(AP) \u2014 Larry Fitzgerald is closing in on another milestone, and it\u2019s an impressive one.\n\nThe 35-year-old receiver needs to catch just 33 yards worth of passes Sunday at Kansas City to move past Hall of Famer Terrell Owens into second place on the NFL\u2019s all-time yards receiving list.\n\nAs usual, Fitzgerald brushed aside talk of the milestone in his weekly meeting with the media Thursday.\n\n\u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t really think about it,\u201d he said.\n\nModesty aside, there\u2019s no doubt that Fitzgerald is very aware of his place among the greats in the game.\n\nHalfway through his 15th season, Fitzgerald has 15,902 yards receiving, behind Owens\u2019 15,934 and Jerry Rice\u2019s phenomenal 22,895.\n\nFitzgerald needs 58 catches to pass Tony Gonzalez for second on the NFL career receptions list. Fitzgerald has 1,268 catches to Gonzalez\u2019s 1,325 and Rice\u2019s 1,549.\n\nFitzgerald also is closing in on Rice\u2019s record for receptions with one team. Fitzgerald, who has spent his entire career with the Cardinals, needs 14 receptions to pass the 1,281 catches Rice had with the San Francisco 49ers.\n\nThere are numbers that Fitzgerald will talk about with pride, and that\u2019s what he\u2019s accomplished in the postseason.\n\nHe has 942 yards receiving in nine postseason games, most of any player in his first nine playoff contests. His three 150-yard playoff receiving games are most in NFL history. His five 100-yard games are tied for third all-time, behind Michael Irvin and Rice. Fitzgerald is tied for third in postseason TD receptions (10), behind John Stallworth and Rice. And Fitzgerald did it in only nine games.\n\nFitzgerald\u2019s performance in Arizona\u2019s surprise run to the Super Bowl in the 2008 season shattered NFL records for yards receiving (546), receptions (30) and touchdowns (7).\n\nIn Arizona\u2019s divisional game against Green Bay in 2015, Fitzgerald caught eight passes for 176 yards, including the two biggest plays of overtime. He is the only player in NFL history to average at least 100 yards receiving and a touchdown in every postseason game.\n\n\u201cI think every player wants to be at their best in the biggest moments,\u201d Fitzgerald said. \u201cI think my numbers in the playoffs say that I\u2019m a guy who steps up in the bigger moments. I think that\u2019s something you look at the greats in history, the Jerry Rices and the Michael Jordans and the Kobe Bryants, the Reggie Jacksons of the world, those guys , when their teams needed them the most, they were able to find something to make a difference in the games.\u201d\n\nBut Fitzgerald may never appear in the playoffs again.\n\nThe Cardinals limp into Kansas City at 2-6 and Fitzgerald repeated Thursday that he hasn\u2019t decided whether this is his last season. It\u2019s hard to imagine him ever playing for another team.\n\nFitzgerald has been conspicuously absent from the statistics as the Arizona offense sputtered through seven games, leading to the firing of offensive coordinator Mike McCoy. With Byron Leftwich as the new coordinator, Fitzgerald had his best game of the year in the team\u2019s 18-15 victory over San Francisco two weekends ago, catching eight passes for 102 yards and a touchdown, just his second of the season.\n\nNotes: S Budda Baker, a critical component of Arizona\u2019s defense, did not practice Thursday due to a foot injury. He was not on the injury report Wednesday. He was the only player who did not practice on Thursday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "INDIANAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 The Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicle says all of its license branches will be closed Saturday in observance of the Veterans Day holiday.\n\nThe BMV also says branches with a regular Monday schedule will be closed Monday in observance of the holiday.\n\nIt says all branches will resume regularly scheduled business hours on Tuesday.\n\nMore information is available online at www.in.gov/BMV/ .", "FILE - In this Oct. 28, 2018, file photo, New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning (10) runs off the field at the end of the first half of the team's NFL football game against the Washington Redskins in East Rutherford, N.J.

(AP Photo/Bill Kostroun, File)\n\nSANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) \u2014 Nick Mullens remembers getting the phone call from Archie Manning inviting him to the prestigious Manning Passing Academy two summers ago.\n\nMullens savored the chance to take part in the four-day clinic run by Archie and his two NFL quarterback sons, Eli and Peyton. Mullens especially relished the opportunity to watch Eli Manning take part in some of the drills.\n\n\u201cTo see how he moves in the pocket, he has very quick feet and is just very smooth,\u201d Mullens said. \u201cI definitely remember just sitting there and watching him throw. I took that all in.\u201d\n\nMullens now will get another chance to see Manning up close when he makes his second career start for the San Francisco 49ers (2-7) on Monday night against Manning and the New York Giants (1-7).\n\nMullens is coming off a scintillating debut, completing 16 of 22 passes for 262 yards, three touchdowns and no interceptions for a 151.9 passer rating in a 34-3 victory over the Oakland Raiders. That\u2019s the highest rating since the merger for a player in his debut with at least 20 attempts.\n\nThings might not be as easy now that the Giants have an idea of what Mullens can do.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019re going to be like, \u2018Oh crap. This guy is good,\u2019\u201d running back Matt Breida said. \u201cI think they\u2019ll put more people back there to cover because of the throws he made and can do.\u201d\n\nWhile Mullens is just getting started, Manning is nearing the end of his career as he plays his 15th season for a team that is struggling mightily. New York has lost five straight games and the questions are mounting about how much longer the two-time Super Bowl MVP Manning has as quarterback.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s urgency to get things going, for sure,\u201d Manning said. \u201cWe got to get some wins. We got to get going, and everybody wants it. The team needs it, for the morale and for just the hard work and everything we put in. Just need to reap the benefits of the work, and feel good about what we\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nHere are some other things to watch:\n\nSPLENDID SAQUON\n\nRookie Saquon Barkley has been a rare bright spot for the struggling Giants, topping 100 yards from scrimmage in seven of his first eight games. Barkley has been a bit hit and miss with 16 runs for negative yards, tied for fifth worst in the league, and 11 plays that gained at least 20, which is tied for second most among running backs. Barkley is just the ninth player to gain at least 1,000 yards from scrimmage in the first eight games of his rookie season.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not one of those guys that says, let me see my stats, let me see how much I ran for this or that. I just play,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to stand here and lie, I am very active on social media, so there\u2019s fan pages of me and I can go on Instagram or even on my explore page and they just happen to pop up. I\u2019ve seen predictions of what I\u2019m capable of doing, but it means nothing to me.\u201d\n\nPRESSURE POINT\n\nThe struggling pass rush for the 49ers broke through in a big way last week with eight sacks against Oakland. Cassius Marsh led the way with a career-best 2 \u00bd, and Dekoda Watson had 1 1/2 in his first game after coming off IR. San Francisco had eight sacks in a game only once in the previous two decades, doing it against the Rams in 2009.\n\nKITTLE\u2019S CATCHES\n\nSan Francisco tight end George Kittle has been a big-play threat all season. He had a 71-yard catch and run last week against the Raiders, making him the first tight end since Rich Caster in 1972 to have two 70-yard catches in the same season. Kittle ranks second among all tight ends with 692 yards receiving and is second to Barkley among all players with 496 yards after the catch.\n\nSTRUGGLING FRANCHISES\n\nTwenty-eight years after these franchises met in the best matchup in \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d history, they now play in one of the worst. Back in 1990, the 49ers beat the Giants 7-3 in a matchup of 10-1 teams that provided the highest winning percentage ever for a Monday night game played after Halloween. The teams come into this meeting with a combined winning percentage of .176, the second lowest for a Monday night game played Nov. 1 or later. The lowest combined winning percentage is .167 for a matchup of the New York Jets (3-9) and the Chargers (1-11) in 1975 that featured Hall of Fame QBs Joe Namath and Dan Fouts.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "PITTSBURGH (AP) \u2014 Pittsburgh Steelers right tackle Marcus Gilbert will miss his third straight game while dealing with a knee injury.\n\nThe Steelers made Gilbert inactive for Thursday night\u2019s game against Carolina.

Mullens said coach Kyle Shanahan told him Tuesday, NOv. 6, 2018, that he will remain the starter for the upcoming game against the New York Giants. (AP Photo/Ben Margot, File)\n\nSANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) \u2014 Nick Mullens knows how to make a good first impression.\n\nWhether it was wearing a suit to his pre-draft interview with the San Francisco 49ers or setting records in his NFL debut, Mullens has proven that he can get off on the right foot in a new situation.\n\nNow the key for Mullens heading into his second start for the 49ers (2-7) on Monday night against the New York Giants will be building on the big performance he had last week against the Oakland Raiders to earn that second chance.\n\nInstead of getting rushed into action on a short week with no real practice, Mullens gets the benefit of a full week of work with his teammates as he tries to match the three-touchdown performance in a 34-3 win over the Raiders last Thursday night.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have to cram everything in in a day and a half,\u201d coach Kyle Shanahan said Thursday. \u201cHe\u2019s got the whole week to kind of let it saturate, learn the play calls, spit them out easier, gets to throw some full-speed balls to all our players where last week there wasn\u2019t one full-speed rep. I think it helps prepare him more and makes him more comfortable going into the game.\u201d\n\nMullens has felt comfortable ever since joining the Niners. He impressed people by dressing up for the interview and even though he went undrafted out of Southern Mississippi, he showed enough to stick around last year on the practice squad.\n\nMullens kept working hard, knowing the offense as well as anyone and improving at working under center after spending so much time in college in the shotgun that he had to watch YouTube videos to teach himself how to drop back properly.\n\n\u201cHe worked as hard as anyone last year and he played scout team safety all last year,\u201d Shanahan said. \u201cWe spent most of last year this time messing with him on how bad his backpedal looked and things like that, on tape. But, he was a guy who just, he knew he had to do that, that\u2019s how the league works. You don\u2019t have enough guys to practice and he didn\u2019t just sit there and mope about it because I get how people could because it isn\u2019t a fair situation. But, he found ways to work on his own, to grab guys after, to go out late at night and do stuff. He\u2019s obsessed with getting better and he\u2019s needed the time to do it and it helped him get ready for last week.\u201d\n\nThat hard work paid off when Mullens got his first chance to play in a game when C.J. Beathard was hampered by a sore right wrist.\n\nMullens completed 16 of 22 passes for 262 yards, three touchdowns and no interceptions for a 151.9 passer rating last week. That\u2019s the highest since the merger for a player in his debut with at least 20 attempts.\n\nMullens also joined Hall of Famers Jim Kelly (1986) and Fran Tarkenton (1961) as the only QBs to throw for at least 250 yards and three touchdowns without throwing an interception in their NFL debuts.\n\nThat made it an easy call to give Mullens a second start this week, although Shanahan said he will evaluate the quarterbacks on a week-to-week basis.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it was too tough of a decision,\u201d Shanahan said. \u201cOur team played really well and he played well. It was going to be hard to not give him the opportunity.\u201d\n\nAbout the only time Mullens got flustered was when Shanahan kept talking after relaying the play call into Mullens\u2019 helmet. Mullens got frustrated enough that teammates said he told Shanahan to quiet down even though the helmet offers only one-way communication.\n\nThat ended up amusing his teammates and lightening the mood in the huddle.\n\n\u201cSometimes in the huddle, you hear the play call and you\u2019re ready to repeat it ...,\u201d Mullens said. \u201cI was just ready to call the play.\u201d\n\nShanahan joked that Mullens will have to yell at him louder if he wants his coach to hear him on the sideline but he understands the frustration.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s always the dilemma for coaches and quarterbacks. It\u2019s funny because I know if I was a quarterback and someone was yelling in my ears, I would handle it much worse than those guys would,\u201d Shanahan said. \u201cI struggle. I\u2019ve almost gotten in trouble with head coaches for saying the wrong thing when you\u2019re trying to think and make a play call and someone\u2019s yelling in your ear, it\u2019s hard to think.\u201d\n\nNOTES: LB Reuben Foster (hamstring) and S Jaquiski Tartt (shoulder) didn\u2019t practice and will be questionable this week. ...
