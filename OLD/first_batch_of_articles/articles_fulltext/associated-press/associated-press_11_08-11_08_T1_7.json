This dominant wide receiver duo is a major reason why the Vikings remain in the mix with the NFC's top contenders despite some rough spots in the first half of the season. (AP Photo/Bruce Kluckhohn, File)\n\nEAGAN, Minn. (AP) \u2014 Thanks to Adam Thielen, Minnesota\u2019s record book has already needed several revisions this year.\n\nJust past the midpoint of the schedule for the Vikings, Thielen leads the NFL in receptions (78) at a pace that would fall four short of the all-time single-season mark (143). He leads the league with 947 yards. Kirk Cousins, the new prize quarterback with the annual $28 million salary cap hit, without prompting recently called Thielen the best player on this standout-laden team.\n\nThe accolades of this magnitude might not exist for Thielen, though, without Stefon Diggs.\n\nThielen and Diggs are the only teammates currently in the top 10 in the league in catches, on pace for a combined 242. That would break the record for receptions by a pair of teammates, set in 1995 by Herman Moore and Brett Perriman for Detroit with 231.\n\nOpposing defenses are naturally less likely to apply double coverage on Thielen when Diggs is in a pattern at the same time, as evidenced by contrast in a victory over the Lions last week . With Diggs sidelined by a rib injury, Thielen didn\u2019t have much space. He used one of his textbook double moves to beat cornerback Nevin Lawson for a short touchdown , his seventh of the year, but he finished with only 22 yards for his lowest total since the 2016 season.\n\nThe mutual benefit of this dominant wide receiver duo, though, began on the practice field years ago.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re always competing, we\u2019re always having fun, and we\u2019re always giving each a hard time if we\u2019re not performing at the level we know we can,\u201d Thielen said.\n\nIf Thielen makes a catch in practice, Diggs will often make it a point to create even more separation from the defender the next time he\u2019s assigned to run the same route. That, in turn, frequently triggers playful yet spirited banter between the two.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s my brother. He\u2019s a guy I love messing with, love having fun with,\u201d Thielen said. \u201cHe\u2019s even one of my best friends.\u201d\n\nAt a position that has long produced some of the NFL\u2019s biggest personalities, in some cases breeding a disruptive brand of selfish and boorish behavior, Thielen and Diggs are the anti-divas. Part of that is a product of their route, no pun intended, to the league.\n\nThielen was the NCAA Division II player who went undrafted and needed a rookie tryout camp to make the team five years ago. He didn\u2019t become a full-time starter until 2016. Diggs was the fifth-round draft pick who was a healthy scratch for his first three NFL games in 2015.\n\n\u201cAll the cute stuff, like records being broken and stuff like that, you like it and it\u2019s good to hear, but we always want to win,\u201d Diggs said. \u201cWe worry about the win column more than anything. So to see good things happen? Yes, it\u2019s exciting. Yes, you congratulate your guys, because guys work extremely hard, you know? So it\u2019s always good stuff, and it\u2019s good stuff moving in the right direction, but we want to win.\u201d\n\nThe Vikings (5-3-1) have been doing that more lately after a rough first quarter of the season, entering their bye week a step behind Chicago (5-3) in the NFC North, with a prime-time matchup with the Bears up next on Nov. 18.\n\nCousins has been as advertised, ranking in the top 10 in the league in most of the passing categories, including third in completion percentage despite being prone to a costly turnover here and there. The offensive line has again shown vulnerabilities, though, and the Vikings have averaged the fourth-fewest rushing yards in the league.\n\nThielen and Diggs have been all the more valuable to the Vikings this fall, with an assist by new offensive coordinator John DeFilippo for aggressive and creative play calling that has helped spring them open so much.\n\n\u201cHe uses his playmakers, and he just lets them play. So I admire that, and I appreciate that,\u201d Diggs said. \u201cAs a player you just want to do the best that you can, and it\u2019s good that he plays to your strengths.\u201d\n\nThe defense, which led the NFL in fewest yards and points allowed last year, was surprisingly one of the biggest problems in September. After that humbling loss in Los Angeles to the Rams dropped the Vikings to 1-2-1, though, coach Mike Zimmer has helped steer the group back into dominant form.\n\nWith daunting road trips to Chicago, New England and Seattle looming over three of the next four games, the pressure will be on the offense to do its part.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at it glass half-full, I\u2019m thrilled about our locker room, the chemistry we have on this team, the quality of teammates, the quality of leadership we have in this organization. I think all that has probably even exceeded expectations from me,\u201d Cousins said. \u201cCertainly would have loved to be better than 5-3-1, but I\u2019m grateful we\u2019re not 3-5-1. You can look at it both ways. The point is, we keep saying, everything is in front of us.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "HARTFORD, Conn.

(AP) \u2014 The Chicago Bears have a rare opportunity to beat the Detroit Lions and pick up a victory over an NFC North opponent.\n\nAs accomplishments go, those seem rather modest. Then again, consider their recent history.\n\nThe division-leading Bears have a chance to check off two more boxes when they host the struggling Lions on Sunday.\n\nThey have lost nine of the past 10 games against Detroit and have dropped 10 in a row to division opponents heading into their matchup at Soldier Field.\n\nSince the start of the 2014 season, Chicago is 4-21 against the NFC North. But these Bears aren\u2019t those Bears.\n\nChicago (5-3) hit the halfway mark with its best record in five years and sole possession of the NFC North lead for the first time since 2013.

When you win, you figure out why and how you can always improve and be better. I like where we\u2019re at, but we understand we have a ways to go.\u201d\n\nChicago is coming off back-to-back wins over two struggling teams, with a 41-9 blowout at Buffalo after beating the New York Jets at home.\n\nDetroit (3-5) has dropped two in a row and last week\u2019s 24-9 loss at Minnesota was particularly ugly. Matthew Stafford got sacked 10 times, and the Lions were held to single digits in points for the first time since a 17-6 loss to the New York Giants on Dec. 18, 2016.\n\nThey also traded wide receiver Golden Tate to Philadelphia prior to the Vikings game, and they fired special teams coordinator Joe Marciano on Monday night.\n\n\u201cDefinitely have to learn from some of those things that we\u2019ve done in the past that haven\u2019t been up to par or haven\u2019t been good enough, and try to minimize those or eliminate them as we go forward,\u201d coach Matt Patricia said. \u201cThat\u2019s the most important thing.\u201d\n\nHere are some things to know about the matchup:\n\nON THE MEND\n\nThe Bears might get star outside linebacker Khalil Mack (ankle) and top receiver Allen Robinson (groin) back from injuries.\n\nBoth players missed the past two games. But they went through full practices on Wednesday. Tight end Adam Shaheen might also return from a foot injury he suffered in the preseason.\n\nANSAH BACK\n\nThe Lions got a boost last week with the return of defensive end Ziggy Ansah.\n\nHe had a sack in the second quarter that forced the Vikings to settle for a field goal, after missing six games because of a shoulder injury. Having Ansah back means more pressure on the quarterback and maybe better luck stopping the run. The Lions rank 30th in that area.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just got to set an edge and whoever has got a gap to be in, they\u2019ve just got to be in there,\u201d Ansah said. \u201cJust play fundamental and be able to execute.\u201d\n\nFAMILIAR FOES\n\nThe Bears are about to meet the Lions twice in a 12-day span, with a Thanksgiving matchup at Ford Field and a primetime Sunday game against Minnesota at home in between.\n\nThis three-game run facing the NFC North comes after four in row against the AFC East. Chicago hasn\u2019t played a division team since a 24-23 season-opening loss at Green Bay, when it blew a 20-point lead against an injured Aaron Rodgers.\n\nSTRUGGLING STAFFORD\n\nAfter a solid stretch, Stafford has struggled a bit the past two weeks with 13 sacks and a 90.3 rating. He had ratings above 100 in each of the previous five games.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been with the Lions for all of his career and he has a great group of receivers, and for some reason they\u2019re not putting games together,\u201d Bears cornerback Prince Amukamara said. \u201cBut they\u2019re still a great team and I know for a fact we won\u2019t take them lightly.\u201d\n\nGETTING OFFENSIVE\n\nWhile a defense that ranks fifth overall has gotten much of the credit, the Bears insist their offense is doing its part.\n\nThough Trubisky has been wild at times, his rating (96.1) is similar to Stafford\u2019s (96.5).

With Democrats headed toward control of both houses of the Legislature, he could have a clear path to enact environment-friendly policies and laws.\n\nThe outdoor retail show\u2019s move from Utah to Colorado was part of the industry\u2019s newfound political activism.\n\nThe Outdoor Industry Association, a trade group affiliated with the show, endorsed a slate of candidates for U.S. Senate, U.S. House and governor for the first time in this year\u2019s midterm elections, and the results were promising, said Alex Boian (BOY\u2019-an), the group\u2019s political director.\n\nThe association endorsed 23 candidates and 20 won, he said.\n\nThe group also made campaign contributions through its political action committee, but the amounts weren\u2019t immediately available.\n\nAsked what impact the endorsements and contributions had, Boian said, \u201cI think in many cases it was significant.\u201d\n\nFifteen of the candidates the group endorsed were Democrats and eight were Republicans.\n\nBoian said the Trump administration\u2019s decision to shrink Bears Ears helped push the association into politics.\n\nOutdoor retailers are also concerned about the escalating U.S. trade war with China, where much outdoor gear is manufactured \u2014 more than 90 percent in some categories, said Rich Harper, the association\u2019s manager for international trade.\n\nHarper said tariffs the U.S. imposed on Chinese-made goods are relatively new and the outdoor industry is still compiling the cost, but he estimated it will be hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nCongress has shown no willingness to challenge the tariffs, so the industry does not expect much help from lawmakers, Harper said. A breakthrough is possible in U.S.-Chinese trade talks, but that could take time, he said.\n\n\u201cThis could be a long trade dispute,\u201d Harper said.", "FILE - In this Oct. 11, 2018, file photo, Michelle Obama participates in the International Day of the Girl on NBC's \"Today\" show in New York.

She also reflects on early struggles in her marriage to Barack Obama as he began his political career and was often away. She writes that they met with a counselor \u201ca handful of times,\u201d and she came to realize that she was more \u201cin charge\u201d of her happiness than she had realized. \u201cThis was my pivot point,\u201d Obama explains. \u201cMy moment of self-arrest.\u201d\n\nObama writes that she assumed Trump was \u201cgrandstanding\u201d when he announced his presidential run in 2015. She expresses disbelief over how so many women would choose a \u201cmisogynist\u201d over Hillary Clinton, \u201can exceptionally qualified female candidate.\u201d She remembers how her body \u201cbuzzed with fury\u201d after seeing the infamous \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape, in which Trump brags about sexually assaulting women.\n\nShe also accuses Trump of using body language to \u201cstalk\u201d Clinton during an election debate.

Obama is admired worldwide and has offered few extensive comments on her White House years. And memoirs by former first ladies, including Clinton and Laura Bush, are usually best-sellers.\n\nObama launches her promotional tour Tuesday not at a bookstore, but at Chicago\u2019s United Center, where tens of thousands of people have purchased tickets \u2014 from just under $30 to thousands of dollars \u2014 to attend the event moderated by Oprah Winfrey. Other stops on a tour scaled to rock star dimensions are planned at large arenas from New York City\u2019s Barclays Center to the Los Angeles Forum, with guests including Reese Witherspoon and Sarah Jessica Parker. While some fans have criticized the price as too high, 10 percent of tickets at each event are being donated to local charities, schools and community groups.\n\nIn \u201cBecoming,\u201d Obama shares both pain and joy. She writes lovingly of her family and gives a detailed account of her courtship with her future husband, whom she met when both were at the Chicago law firm Sidley Austin LLP; she was initially his adviser. Secretaries claimed he was both brilliant and \u201ccute,\u201d although Michelle Obama was skeptical, writing that white people went \u201cbonkers\u201d any time you \u201cput a suit\u201d on a \u201chalf-intelligent black man.\u201d She also thought his picture had a \u201cwhiff of geekiness.\u201d\n\nBut she was more than impressed after meeting him, by his \u201crich, even sexy baritone\u201d and by his \u201cstrange, stirring combination\u201d of serenity and power. \u201cThis strange mix-of-everything-man,\u201d when she finally let him kiss her, set off a \u201ctoppling blast of lust, gratitude, fulfillment, wonder.\u201d\n\nBut throughout her husband\u2019s life in politics, she fought to balance public and private needs, and to maintain her self-esteem. She agonized over what she feared was a cartoonish, racist image. She remembered being labeled \u201cangry\u201d and, by the Fox network, \u201cObama\u2019s Baby Mama.\u201d At times, she feared she was damaging her husband\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign, especially after conservatives seized on a line from one of her speeches \u2014 taken out of context, she notes \u2014 that for the first time as an adult she was \u201creally proud\u201d of her country.\n\nThe remarks faded from the news, but she sensed lasting damage, a \u201cpernicious seed,\u201d a \u201cperception\u201d that she was \u201cdisgruntled and vaguely hostile.\u201d\n\nAs the first black first lady, she knew she would be labeled \u201cother\u201d and would have to earn the aura of \u201cgrace\u201d given freely to her white predecessors. She found confidence in repeating to herself a favorite chant: \u201cAm I good enough? Yes I am.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecoming\u201d is part of a joint book deal with former President Barack Obama, whose memoir is expected next year, that is believed worth tens of millions of dollars.

Joining her was her lieutenant governor-elect Lynn Rogers. (Thad Allton/The Topeka Capital-Journal via AP)\n\nTOPEKA, Kan. (AP) \u2014 Kansas\u2019 new Democratic governor-elect said Thursday that she will look to block enforcement of a new adoption law that she and LGBT-rights activists consider discriminatory, a sharp break with the state\u2019s two previous conservative Republican governors.\n\nGov.-elect Laura Kelly said she will have her staff review how far the state can go to avoid enforcing the law. It was designed to provide legal protections to adoption agencies that cite faith-based reasons for refusing to place children in homes that violate their religious beliefs.\n\nThe debate over the law centered on agencies that won\u2019t place children in LGBT foster homes. The agencies handle those adoptions of abused and neglected children for the state Department for Children and Families. Supporters saw it as a religious liberties measure.\n\nKelly, a veteran state senator from Topeka, voted against what she called \u201cthe adoption discrimination\u201d measure when the Republican-controlled Legislature approved it in May. In the governor\u2019s race, she defeated conservative Republican Kris Kobach, the Kansas secretary of state, and was endorsed by Equality Kansas, the state\u2019s most influential LGBT-rights group.\n\n\u201cIf there is way to direct the agency to not implement that, then I will do that,\u201d Kelly said during a Statehouse news conference, her first since winning the election.\n\nChuck Weber, the Catholic Conference\u2019s executive director, said supporters of the law will fight to see that it\u2019s fully enforced.\n\n\u201cThis is not a surprise, that Gov.-elect Kelly would try to circumvent the will of the people of Kansas to advance her own radical agenda,\u201d said Weber, a former Kansas House member.\n\nThe law says the state can\u2019t force an adoption agency to make placements in homes that violate its religious beliefs. An adoption agency cannot be denied a license or state reimbursement for a placement, or blocked from participating in DCF programs, solely because of its beliefs.\n\nTom Witt, Equality Kansas\u2019 executive director, said the law so clearly allows adoption agencies to engage in discrimination while receiving tax dollars that the state shouldn\u2019t enforce it.\n\n\u201cThere are a number of unconstitutional laws on the books that aren\u2019t being enforced,\u201d Witt said. \u201cThe (state\u2019s same-sex) marriage ban comes to mind.\u201d\n\nBut Weber said: \u201cWe were very careful in drafting that bill, in dotting i\u2019s and crossing t\u2019s and making sure that this would pass constitutional muster.\u201d\n\nDeparting Republican Gov. Jeff Colyer signed the measure, and his DCF secretary backed it as a way to encourage more groups to do adoptions.\n\nColyer took office in January when GOP Gov. Sam Brownback resigned to become U.S. ambassador at large for international religious freedom. In 2015, Brownback rescinded a previous executive order from Democratic Gov. Kathleen Sebelius barring anti-LGBT bias in state hiring and employment decisions, saying such a policy should be set by the Legislature.\n\nKelly told reporters Thursday that she will have a new order reinstating such protections drafted before she takes office so that it can be issued as quickly as possible.\n\n______\n\nFollow John Hanna on Twitter: https://twitter.com/apjdhanna\n\n.", "Oklahoma City Thunder guard Russell Westbrook (0) puts up a shot over New Orleans Pelicans forward E'Twaun Moore (55) in the second half of an NBA basketball game in Oklahoma City, Monday, Nov. 5, 2018.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 A video distributed by the Trump administration to support its argument for banning CNN reporter Jim Acosta from the White House appears to have been doctored to make Acosta look more aggressive than he was during an exchange with a White House intern, an independent expert said Thursday.\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Sanders tweeted the video, which shows Acosta asking President Donald Trump a question on Wednesday as the intern tries to take his microphone away. But a frame-by-frame comparison with an Associated Press video of the same incident shows that the one tweeted by Sanders appears to have been altered to speed up Acosta\u2019s arm movement as he touches the intern\u2019s arm, according to Abba Shapiro, an independent video producer who examined the footage at AP\u2019s request.\n\nEarlier, Shapiro noticed that frames in the tweeted video were frozen to slow down the action, allowing it to run the same length as the AP one.\n\nThe tweeted video also does not have any audio, which Shapiro said would make it easier to alter. It\u2019s also unlikely the differences could be explained by technical glitches or by video compression \u2014 a reduction in a video\u2019s size to enable it to play more smoothly on some sites \u2014 because the slowing of the video and the acceleration that followed are \u201ctoo precise to be an accident,\u201d said Shapiro, who trains instructors to use video editing software.\n\nAn independent video production trainer tells the AP a video tweeted by the White House on an interaction between CNN reporter Jim Acosta and an intern appears to have been manipulated to make the reporter's actions look more aggressive. (Nov. 8)\n\nSanders, who hasn\u2019t said where the tweeted video came from, noted that it clearly shows Acosta made contact with the intern.

Its position has been supported by witnesses including Reuters White House correspondent Jeff Mason, who was next to Acosta during the news conference and tweeted that he did not see Acosta place his hands on the White House employee. Rather, he said he saw him holding on to the microphone as she reached for it.\n\n\u201cThe irony of this White House video involving Jim Acosta is that if it is found to be doctored, it will show the administration to be doing what it accuses the news media of doing \u2014 engaging in fake information,\u201d said Aly Colon, a professor in journalism ethics at Washington & Lee University.\n\nSeveral journalists and organizations \u2014 including the American Society of News Editors, the Associated Press Media Editors and the Online News Association \u2014 demanded Acosta\u2019s press pass be reinstated.\n\n\u201cIt is the essential function of a free press in every democracy to independently gather and report information in the public interest, a right that is enshrined in the First Amendment,\u201d said Julie Pace, AP\u2019s Washington bureau chief. \u201cWe strongly reject the idea that any administration would block a journalist\u2019s access to the White House.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times editorialized in favor of restoring Acosta\u2019s pass, saying it signaled Trump\u2019s view that asking hard questions disqualifies reporters from attending briefings. The newspaper said that if Sanders was so offended by physical contact, \u201cwhat did she have to say when her boss praised as \u2018my kind of guy\u2019 Rep. Greg Gianforte of Montana, who was sentenced to anger management classes and community service for body-slamming a Guardian reporter last spring?\u201d\n\nCNN has been a frequent target of the president, who has characterized journalists as enemies of the people and who routinely accuses the mainstream media of spreading \u201cfake news.\u201d And Acosta has been one of the more visible thorns in the side of the White House. During their verbal altercation on Wednesday, Trump called Acosta a \u201cterrible person.\u201d\n\nStill, it\u2019s rare for the White House to pull the so-called hard passes from journalists.\n\nDuring Lyndon Johnson\u2019s presidency, the Secret Service denied clearance to Robert Sherrill, a reporter for The Nation who had gotten into physical fights with government officials.

Trump\u2019s advisers are privately expressing worries that the special counsel, who\u2019s been out of the news for the past month, has been stealthily compiling information and could soon issue new indictments or a damning final report.\n\nTrump abruptly altered the chain of command above Mueller on Wednesday, putting his work under the supervision of a Republican loyalist who has been openly skeptical of the special counsel\u2019s authority and has mused about ways to curtail his power. But Trump and his aides are concerned about Mueller\u2019s next move with the work that is complete, according to a White House official and a Republican with close ties to the administration.\n\nThey insisted on anonymity to comment on conversations they were not authorized to describe.\n\nMueller kept a low profile for the past month as voters were mulling their choices for this week\u2019s elections.\n\nBut a flurry of activity during his quiet period, including weeks of grand jury testimony about Trump confidant Roger Stone and negotiations over an interview with the president, hinted at public developments ahead as investigators move closer to addressing key questions underpinning the special counsel inquiry: Did Trump illegally obstruct the investigation? And did his campaign have advance knowledge of illegally hacked Democratic emails?\n\nTrump has told confidants he remains deeply annoyed by the 18-month-old Mueller probe, believing it is not just a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d but an expensive and lengthy negative distraction. The latest indication of the fury came Wednesday when he forced out his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, whose recusal opened the door to Mueller\u2019s appointment.\n\nTo this point, Trump has heeded advice not to directly interfere, though a new chapter in the relationship with the probe may have begun with the appointment of Matthew Whitaker as new acting attorney general. Even if Whitaker, Sessions\u2019 former chief of staff, does not curtail the investigation, Trump could direct him to take a more aggressive stance in declassifying documents that could further undermine or muddle the probe, the White House aide and Republican official said.\n\nThe investigation until now has been overseen by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who appointed Mueller last year and granted him fairly broad authority.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very significant because Whitaker\u2019s position on indictments or future indictments may be different than Rosenstein\u2019s, and Rosenstein had given Mueller a broad mandate to pursue various crimes,\u201d said Washington criminal defense lawyer Jeffrey Jacobovitz.\n\nThe Mueller investigation has so far produced 32 criminal charges and four guilty pleas from Trump associates. But the work is not done.\n\nA clear focus concerns Stone, a longtime political dirty trickster. The special counsel\u2019s team has been investigating Stone\u2019s connection to WikiLeaks during the 2016 campaign and whether he had advance knowledge of the group\u2019s plans to release hacked material damaging to Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\nStone has said he did not, but emails, Twitter messages and his own public statements show he portrayed himself as plugged into the WikiLeaks orbit.

Trump\u2019s advisers are privately expressing worries that the special counsel, who\u2019s been out of the news for the past month, has been stealthily compiling information and could soon issue new indictments or a damning final report.\n\nTrump abruptly altered the chain of command above Mueller on Wednesday, putting his work under the supervision of a Republican loyalist who has been openly skeptical of the special counsel\u2019s authority and has mused about ways to curtail his power. But Trump and his aides are concerned about Mueller\u2019s next move with the work that is complete, according to a White House official and a Republican with close ties to the administration.\n\nThey insisted on anonymity to comment on conversations they were not authorized to describe.\n\nMueller kept a low profile for the past month as voters were mulling their choices for this week\u2019s elections.\n\nBut a flurry of activity during his quiet period, including weeks of grand jury testimony about Trump confidant Roger Stone and negotiations over an interview with the president, hinted at public developments ahead as investigators move closer to addressing key questions underpinning the special counsel inquiry: Did Trump illegally obstruct the investigation? And did his campaign have advance knowledge of illegally hacked Democratic emails?\n\nTrump has told confidants he remains deeply annoyed by the 18-month-old Mueller probe, believing it is not just a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d but an expensive and lengthy negative distraction. The latest indication of the fury came Wednesday when he forced out his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, whose recusal opened the door to Mueller\u2019s appointment.\n\nTo this point, Trump has heeded advice not to directly interfere, though a new chapter in the relationship with the probe may have begun with the appointment of Matthew Whitaker as new acting attorney general. Even if Whitaker, Sessions\u2019 former chief of staff, does not curtail the investigation, Trump could direct him to take a more aggressive stance in declassifying documents that could further undermine or muddle the probe, the White House aide and Republican official said.\n\nThe investigation until now has been overseen by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who appointed Mueller last year and granted him fairly broad authority.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very significant because Whitaker\u2019s position on indictments or future indictments may be different than Rosenstein\u2019s, and Rosenstein had given Mueller a broad mandate to pursue various crimes,\u201d said Washington criminal defense lawyer Jeffrey Jacobovitz.\n\nThe Mueller investigation has so far produced 32 criminal charges and four guilty pleas from Trump associates. But the work is not done.\n\nA clear focus concerns Stone, a longtime political dirty trickster. The special counsel\u2019s team has been investigating Stone\u2019s connection to WikiLeaks during the 2016 campaign and whether he had advance knowledge of the group\u2019s plans to release hacked material damaging to Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\nStone has said he did not, but emails, Twitter messages and his own public statements show he portrayed himself as plugged into the WikiLeaks orbit.

(AP) \u2014 Mississippi\u2019s state Board of Education on Thursday approved A-to-F school ratings for a school district, plus four schools that teach special populations, despite complaints that the rating system treats them unfairly.\n\nOfficials told the board Thursday that under their interpretation of state and federal laws, the state must rate those schools using the same tests and standards as other schools. The board had delayed action on those schools in October when it approved grades for others.\n\nCorinth got a C overall and its high school was rated F. However, other measures, such as ACT scores and graduation rates, suggest the district performs like higher-rated districts.\n\n\u201cWe do not believe it is an accurate reflection of the achievement and growth of our schools,\u201d said Superintendent Lee Childress. His district focuses on preparing students for the international Cambridge exams and not Mississippi\u2019s state tests.\n\nThe state also gave failing marks to the Mississippi School for the Blind, Mississippi School for the Deaf, and schools in the Harrison County and Pascagoula-Gautier districts that serve only special education students.\n\nNone of those special schools had ever been rated before, and the state had once agreed to develop an alternative rating system for Corinth, which uses a special curriculum and tests. However, state Chief Accountability Officer Paula Vanderford said the state determined in April that it would be illegal for the state to continue with either policy.\n\n\u201cThere are no exclusions in state or federal law for assigning grades to schools that have special populations,\u201d she said.\n\nState school board member Johnny Franklin of Bolton, the only board member who voted against the decision, said it\u2019s punitive both to schools that seek to be innovative and that are already challenged with students who are blind, deaf or have severe disabilities.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got enough challenges as it is without us going and handing another thing around their neck, and that\u2019s an F,\u201d Franklin said.\n\nChildress disputes the state\u2019s legal interpretation. He notes that the waiver granted to Corinth to allow it to adopt a different curriculum, a modified year-round schedule and other changes is the same law the state cited in refusing to develop an alternative assessment. And in some other states under the current Every Student Succeeds Act, individual school districts are choosing among different types of tests.\n\nCorinth has earlier gone to court to try to block the grade, but Childress said it was likely the local school board would choose to appeal to the state Commission on School Accreditation. Turning first to such administrative remedies could give Corinth better grounds in a later court appeal.\n\nChildress said he hoped the district and state could resume work on getting the Cambridge exams approved, but said the district is taking measures to better prepare students for state tests. He said the low grades won\u2019t undermine Cornith\u2019s efforts to \u201cdo school differently.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe do not think it will undermine it in any way,\u201d he said. \u201cOur commitment to Cambridge remains strong.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Jeff Amy on Twitter at http://twitter.com/jeffamy .", "", "Graphic shows voter turnout figures for U.S. national elections since 1992.\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 In a story Nov. 8 about Election Day turnout, The Associated Press misidentified the source of an analysis of youth voters. It is the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement at Tufts University, not \u201cCivil Learning.\u201d\n\nA corrected version of the story is below:\n\nTrump triggers massive midterm turnout\n\nNot on the ballot, but Trump triggers massive midterm turnout\n\nBy STEVE PEOPLES and THOMAS BEAUMONT\n\nAssociated Press\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump has inspired outrage, love, fear and every emotion in between. He has also inspired record-breaking turnout at the ballot box.\n\nWith votes still being counted, an estimated 113 million Americans cast ballots in the first nationwide election of the Trump presidency, according to data compiled by The Associated Press. That\u2019s 30 million more people who participated in the 2014 midterms, representing the highest raw vote total for a non-presidential election in U.S. history and the highest overall voter participation rate in a midterm election in a half century.\n\nDemocrats\u2019 blue wave was real. But so was a corresponding surge in Republican enthusiasm that allowed the president\u2019s party to counter the Democrats\u2019 new House majority with big wins in top contests for the Senate and governorships this week.\n\n\u201cThis election was about both Democrats and Republicans showing up,\u201d said Michael McDonald, a University of Florida political science professor who tracks voter turnout the United States Elections Project.\n\nIndeed, voter participation rates approached presidential levels in some states as even the most optimistic voting experts and political operatives underestimated Trump\u2019s ability to drive voter turnout on both sides.\n\nDemocrats seized the House majority by flipping at least 28 seats nationwide. They could claim as many as 35 new seats once all the votes are counted, which could take weeks in some cases.\n\nAnalyzing 417 House races that featured at least two candidates on the ballot, The AP has determined that Democrats earned more than 51.4 million votes in competitive House races nationwide, or 52 percent, compared to 47.2 million votes cast, or 48 percent, for Republicans.\n\nBut both parties exceeded turnout expectations.\n\nVoting experts noted that turnout exploded in states with big-ticket elections such as Florida, which featured high-profile races for Senate and governor, and those states with lower-profile contests such as North Carolina, which featured only judicial races on the statewide ballot. Voter participation rates jumped by around 10 points in both states.\n\nIn battleground Ohio, voting was up 42 percent compared to the 2014 midterm election. In Hamilton County, which includes Cincinnati, turnout exceeded any midterm election over the last 30 years.\n\nThe trend was similar in battleground Florida, where voting increased 33 percent over 2014. And in Texas, where Democratic superstar Beto O\u2019Rourke narrowly lost his bid to unseat Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, voting was up an astounding 92 percent as roughly 8.2 million people voted in 2018 compared to 4.7 million four years earlier.\n\nEven with the surge, Republicans won the highest-profile races in all three states. The losses in governors races in Ohio and Florida were particularly concerning to Democrats given those states\u2019 significance in presidential elections.\n\nStill, both parties claimed partial victory.\n\n\u201cI thought It was very close to complete victory,\u201d Trump said in a testy press conference Wednesday, suggesting that losing the House would improve his political fate.\n\nDemocrats seized on their overall advantage in the popular vote, which showed their candidates across the nation earning millions more votes than the GOP.\n\n\u201cBottom line, Donald Trump lost the popular vote by 2 points in 2016 and he\u2019s on track to lose it by 9 in 2018,\u201d said Jesse Ferguson, former executive director of the Democrats House campaign arm. \u201cWe saw an uptick in Democratic enthusiasm and turnout, an uptick in first-time voters, an uptick in new registrants, and this electorate was more diverse and a little younger than typical midterm elections.\u201d\n\nIndeed, outside groups that pumped hundreds of millions of dollars into the midterm season to engage young people and minorities cited evidence that their strategy worked, even while admitting disappointment about losing big races \u2014 none bigger than the Florida governorship.\n\nYouth turnout, as defined by voters between 18 and 29, surged to a number not seen in a midterm election in a quarter century. Overall, 31 percent of eligible young people cast ballots, according to an analysis by the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement at Tufts University.\n\nIn 2014, only an estimated 21 percent of young voters turned out.\n\nBut because of a surge in turnout among other demographics, it\u2019s unclear whether young people had outsized impact.\n\nFlorida voters between the ages of 18 and 29 made up 12 percent of those who cast ballots, according to VoteCast, a wide-ranging survey of the electorate conducted by The Associated Press. Sixty percent of those young voters backed losing candidate Andrew Gillum, who would have been the state\u2019s first African American governor.\n\nYoung voters nationwide also made up 12 percent of the electorate, with 6 in 10 backing Democrats.\n\nTufts found evidence that young voters played a significant role in defeating Nevada Sen. Dean Heller and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, both Republicans.\n\nThe data left little doubt as to what caused the surge in enthusiasm. Nearly two-thirds of voters said Trump was a reason for their vote, according to VoteCast.\n\n\u201cTrump drove turnout on both sides,\u201d said Howard Wolfson, a chief aide to former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who spent more than $110 million to help Democrats this year.\n\n\u201cThere were Democrats who would have crawled over broken glass to vote against Republicans because of Trump,\u201d Wolfson added. \u201cAnd in the last week, he certainly motivated some base Trump voters to come out enthusiastically themselves.\u201d\n\nTurnout broke records for midterm elections in Midwestern battlegrounds such as Wisconsin and Iowa, though with conflicting results.\n\nRoughly 2.7 million voted in Wisconsin, the state\u2019s highest midterm turnout on record, though short of the state\u2019s 3.1 million-voter turnout in the 2016 presidential election. Iowa also posted its highest-ever midterm turnout, with 1.3 million voters casting ballots, nearly matching its 1.5 million turnout in 2016.\n\n\u201cThere were big disappointments clearly, but there were lots of great wins,\u201d said Page Gardner, founder and president of the Voter Participation Center, which works to boost turnout among underrepresented groups. \u201cThese people helped create finally a divided government \u2014 and a check on the president.\u201d", "", "HARTINGTON, Neb.

Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., watches election returns in her race for the U.S. Senate with former Gov. Phil Bredesen Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2018, in Franklin, Tenn. (AP Photo/Mark Humphrey)\n\nNASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 Women voters were split on electing Republican Marsha Blackburn as Tennessee\u2019s first female U.S. senator, and their age often shaped their preference, according to a wide-ranging survey of voters in Tennessee.\n\nThe congresswoman\u2019s performance among women came out a wash because those 45 and older favored Blackburn by 9 percentage points, while women younger than that backed Democratic former Gov. Phil Bredesen by 10 points, according to data gathered by AP VoteCast, a nationwide survey of 115,000 voters and 22,000 nonvoters.\n\nBlackburn, a fiery supporter of President Donald Trump, was elected Tuesday to replace frequent Trump critic Bob Corker, who is retiring.\n\nPre-election polls suggested it was an open question whether female voters would back Blackburn, who firmly endorsed Trump\u2019s choice of Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court when the nominee faced a woman\u2019s sexual assault allegations dating from high school.\n\nWhile Kavanaugh denied the allegations and was confirmed last month, the nomination fight brought gender to the forefront of Tennessee\u2019s $85 million Senate contest. Bredesen broke with Democrats in ultimately saying he would have voted for Kavanaugh, but he tempered that by calling Kavanaugh\u2019s accuser a \u201cheroine.\u201d\n\nSome polls suggested Blackburn would struggle, while others suggested female voters were more divided.\n\nAge overall represented a big breaking point for Blackburn, with both male and female voters 45 and older favoring her by 18 percentage points, and those younger leaning toward Bredesen, 51 percent to 46 percent. Men, meanwhile, preferred Blackburn over Bredesen by 20 points.\n\nBredesen got a campaign boost from Taylor Swift. The pop star endorsed him on Instagram and criticized several of Blackburn\u2019s votes on LGBT and women\u2019s issues, saying her voting record \u201cappalls and terrifies\u201d her.\n\nBut immigration was the issue foremost on voters\u2019 minds, the survey showed.\n\nRegardless of gender, voters who supported Blackburn, like voters who supported Republicans nationally, focused on immigration: Nearly 4 in 10 Blackburn voters named immigration as the most important issue confronting the nation. About the same share of Bredesen voters identified health care as the key issue.\n\nBlackburn, a Fox news regular with tea party credentials, followed Trump\u2019s lead on immigration in touting his proposed U.S.-Mexico border wall and echoing Trump\u2019s fear-instilling rhetoric about thousands of Central American migrants headed north across Mexico.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of agreement on issues and I think that that\u2019s why women moved toward us,\u201d Blackburn told The Associated Press in a phone interview.\n\nAmong women 45 and older, 55 percent described themselves as Republican or leaning that way, with 35 percent saying they lean or are Democratic. For women up to 44 years old, 47 percent said they lean or are Republican and 43 percent said they lean or are Democratic.\n\nBlackburn made a point of stressing she wasn\u2019t running for office on her gender. But she picked moments to bring gender into focus.\n\nShe preferred to be called congressman, not congresswoman. And in her victory speech Tuesday, she happily said people could now just call her senator.\n\nHer campaign also highlighted her moves to break the glass ceiling: She was the first woman hired by a major Nashville-based marketing and publishing company that sells educational materials \u2014 and the only Republican woman in the Tennessee Senate in 1998.\n\nIn February, when some Republicans worried about losing a Senate seat encouraged Corker to reconsider, Blackburn\u2019s spokesman said anyone who thought she couldn\u2019t win the general election was a \u201cplain sexist pig.\u201d\n\nStill, the historic significance of becoming Tennessee\u2019s first female senator wasn\u2019t lost on her on election night. She specifically noted a moment when a group of jubilant college-aged women came up to her at her victory party.\n\n\u201cThey were just so excited that there was a female that they identified with who was breaking a barrier and opening more doors for them,\u201d Blackburn said. \u201cAnd I appreciate having that opportunity.\u201d\n\nAs for Swift, Blackburn said, she doesn\u2019t think her interjection made any difference one way or another.\n\nAP VoteCast found that among Blackburn voters, 55 percent said they have an unfavorable view of Taylor Swift and just 16 percent have a favorable one. Among Bredesen voters, 51 percent have a favorable opinion of Swift and just 10 percent have an unfavorable one. The remainder of both groups of voters did not give an opinion.\n\n\u201cI hope (Swift) and her colleagues could kind of shake it off and realize that I always like to have a conversation with people who want to improve the quality of lives for Tennesseans,\u201d Blackburn said, throwing in a reference to Swift\u2019s \u2018Shake it Off.\u2019", "The Top 20 Global Concert Tours ranks artists by average box office gross per city and includes the average ticket price for shows Worldwide.

(AP) \u2014 Two-time All-Pro pass rusher Khalil Mack and top receiver Allen Robinson look as if they\u2019re just about ready to return after missing the Chicago Bears\u2019 past two games because of injuries.\n\nBoth players practiced without limitations Thursday for the second consecutive day.\n\nThe NFC North-leading Bears hope to have them back in the lineup against the Detroit Lions at Soldier Field on Sunday.\n\n\u201cThese are strange deals because, literally, as you\u2019re going through it (you\u2019re) trying to figure out where they\u2019re at on a day-to-day basis,\u201d coach Matt Nagy said Thursday. \u201cWhere are you at? Can you go 100 percent? Can you not? How do you feel? And we need to take that into consideration and discuss that, which leads up to game time and then how much, if so.\u201d\n\nRobinson sent strong signals that he intends to play, saying he\u2019s \u201c100 percent\u201d after a groin injury kept him from playing in victories over the struggling New York Jets and Buffalo Bills. He has 25 catches for 285 and two touchdowns in six games after signing a three-year contract with Chicago in March.\n\nRobinson missed just about all of last season with Jacksonville after tearing the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee early in the opener. He was brought along slowly in the preseason as he worked his way back while trying to learn a new system and develop a rapport with quarterback Mitchell Trubisky.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m feeling great, and I\u2019m definitely anxious to get back out there,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a tough couple weeks, just having to watch the game from the sideline, so I\u2019m excited.\u201d\n\nMack, who did not make himself available for comment, got off to a huge start with the Bears following a trade from Oakland just before the opener. He had five sacks and four forced fumbles through the first four games. But he suffered an ankle injury early in an overtime loss at Miami on Oct. 14 and was largely a nonfactor the following week when New England beat Chicago at Soldier Field.\n\nMack had not missed a game since Oakland drafted him with the fifth overall pick in 2014, before sitting out the past two. And he still was adjusting to defensive coordinator Vic Fangio\u2019s system even though he sure looked dominant before he got hurt.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t practice much the two weeks he\u2019s missed ... so he\u2019s not where he needs to be or where we want him to be,\u201d Fangio said. \u201cBut he\u2019s certainly prepared enough to go out there and play if his ankle will let him.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "Sen.

Successful fantasy owners shouldn\u2019t go into victory formation yet, as one bad week or unfortunate injury can change the complexion of the whole season.\n\nThose still pushing for a postseason berth should pull out all the stops without fear. Week 10 brings opportunity for players who have otherwise been disappointments along with a rookie or two who should be used to exploit favorable matchups.\n\nSTART: Jordan Howard, RB, Bears: With four touchdowns in his last three games, Howard is showing signs of finally breaking out of his season-long funk. Howard is no longer a component in the Chicago passing game, but he\u2019s averaged 19 touches per game over the past three weeks. Now he faces a Lions run defense that gives up 5.1 yards per carry and is ranked 27th in stopping the run. He\u2019s still a long way from the RB1 many envisioned he\u2019d be on draft day, but Howard will fit in most fantasy lineups as a solid RB2 this Sunday.\n\nSIT: Rob Gronkowski, TE, Patriots: Yes, him. Gronkowski hasn\u2019t scored a touchdown since Week 1 and has exceeded better than 70 receiving yards just twice after tagging the Texans for 123 yards in the regular season opener. He missed last Sunday\u2019s win against the Packers and is questionable for Sunday\u2019s game versus the Titans. There are good streaming options available at tight end (Chris Herndon of the Jets, for example) but the days of Gronkowski as a must-start fantasy beast appear to be reaching their end.\n\nSTART: Marquez Valdes-Scantling, WR, Packers: Since joining the starting lineup, Valdes-Scantling is averaging just over nine targets per game and has a pair of 100-yard outings to go along with two touchdowns. Green Bay\u2019s pass, pass and pass again mindset makes the rookie a strong WR2 who continues to gain the trust of Aaron Rodgers. He\u2019ll keep building his rapport with Rodgers at the expense of a Miami defense that is 25th in receiving yards allowed and 29th in yards per catch allowed. Valdes-Scantling has averaged 21.1 yards per catch, as seven of his 17 receptions have been for 20 yards or longer.\n\nSIT: Derek Carr, QB, Raiders: The optimism about Carr following a strong performance against the Colts was critically shattered after a near-lifeless effort against the 49ers. Things will not get better for Carr, who must contend with a Chargers defense that is a solid 12th in net passing yards allowed and is tied for sixth with 10 interceptions. While Carr has 10 touchdown passes this season, keep in mind that seven of those came in two games. Los Angeles held him to just 14 fantasy points when the two teams met in Week 5.\n\nSTART: Michael Gallup, WR, Cowboys: Dak Prescott has gotten the rookie wideout more involved over the past two games, with 11 of his 28 targets this season coming in that span. He\u2019s responded well, catching six passes for 132 yards and a touchdown and will continue his upward trend going against a suspect Eagles pass defense that is 20th in net passing yards allowed. Gallup has shown he doesn\u2019t need a lot of targets to make an impact, which makes him an intriguing WR3/flex option.\n\nSIT: Kenny Golladay, WR, Lions: Even with Golden Tate no longer in the lineup, Golladay was a non-factor in last week\u2019s loss to the Vikings, catching just three passes for 46 yards on four targets. Things don\u2019t get easier for Golladay, who faces a Bears defense that is ninth in fewest net passing yards and is second only to the Dolphins with 14 interceptions. Golladay should see more targets after having a mere seven in his last three games combined, but there\u2019s little to feel good about playing him, especially in a PPR format.\n\nSTART: Marcus Mariota, QB, Titans: He\u2019s starting to round into shape and comes off his second game of better than 20 fantasy points with a great chance at a third against the Patriots. New England is 28th in net passing yards allowed and have given up 19 touchdown passes and must deal with Mariota\u2019s running ability. While he\u2019d be a gamble in standard leagues, Mariota is a good play in deeper leagues. There\u2019s a good chance he steps his game up and turns this contest into a high-scoring affair.\n\nSIT: Matthew Stafford, QB, Lions: Stafford hasn\u2019t recorded a game of better than 20 fantasy points since Week 4 and after being sacked 10 times by the Vikings last week, his body will go through another brutal afternoon against the Bears, who have 24 sacks along with 14 interceptions. Chicago is ninth in fewest net passing yards, and if the Lions fall behind early, Stafford had better brace for a long afternoon of uncomfortable meetings with Chicago\u2019s withering pass rush.\n\nSTART: Aaron Jones, RB, Packers: Sooner or later, the Packers will catch on to giving Jones more than 12-14 carries per game. Sunday would be a good time to do so, as Green Bay gets a Miami defense ranked 31st against the run and allows a healthy 4.6 yards per carry, which bodes well for Jones\u2019 six yards per attempt. Yes, there is some disappointment in Jones after his fumble against the Patriots, but there\u2019s a great rebound opportunity awaiting any fantasy owner willing to use him as an RB2.\n\nSIT: Wendell Smallwood, RB, Eagles: In fact, avoiding Eagles running backs altogether is a sound move. The backfield by committee style is a fantasy killer, one whose level of pain is increased by facing a Cowboys run defense that is seventh in fewest yards allowed and gives up a mere 3.6 yards per carry.\n\n___\n\nFor more Week 10 fantasy insight and tips, visit RotoExperts: https://rotoexperts.com", "", "FILE - In this Sept. 15, 2018, file photo, Georgia running back Elijah Holyfield (13) breaks through the Middle Tennessee defense for a big gain in the first half of an NCAA college football game in Athens, Ga.

(AP Photo/John Bazemore, File)\n\nATHENS, Ga. (AP) \u2014 When Elijah Holyfield was pondering where he wanted to go to college, he certainly took an interest in history.\n\nSpecifically, Georgia\u2019s long lineage of great running backs.\n\n\u201cIt was a very big deal to me. I\u2019ve watched Georgia football for a long time and I\u2019ve really loved all the Georgia backs,\u201d said Holyfield, son of former heavyweight champion Evander Holyfield . \u201cIt had a lot to do with my decision.\u201d\n\nFrom Herschel Walker through the 1-2 punch of Nick Chubb and Sony Michel, the No. 5 Bulldogs might as well be known as Running Back U.\n\nThey\u2019re living up to reputation again with the current backfield duo of Holyfield and D\u2019Andre Swift.\n\nIn last week\u2019s pulverizing 34-17 victory over Kentucky , which locked up Georgia\u2019s spot in the Southeastern Conference championship game, Swift rushed for 156 yards and two touchdowns, Holyfield tacked on a career-best 115 yards and a score, and the Bulldogs finished with a season-high 331 yards on the ground against one of the nation\u2019s top-ranked defenses.\n\nGeorgia (8-1, 6-1, No. 5 CFP) leads the SEC in rushing (233.8 yards per game), carrying on a tradition that goes back as far as 1942 Heisman Trophy winner Frank Sinkwich but really picked up steam with the arrival of Herschel Walker.\n\nWalker, who capped his brilliant career by capturing the Heisman in 1982, is still recognized as the greatest back in school history. But he\u2019s had plenty of challengers over past 3\u00bd decades.\n\nSince Walker left school a year early to play in the ill-fated United States Football League, seven Georgia running backs have been picked in the first round of the NFL draft \u2014 an esteemed list that doesn\u2019t even include Terrell Davis, who was only a sixth-rounder but went on to a Hall of Fame career with the Denver Broncos.\n\nMore recently, Georgia\u2019s pipeline has grown to include Todd Gurley, Sony Michel and Nick Chubb \u2014 who actually were on the same team in 2014 and are all now thriving in the NFL. Gurley stars for the Los Angeles Rams , earning All-Pro honors in 2017 and leading the league in rushing this season. Michel is starting for the New England Patriots as a rookie, while Chubb is getting significant playing time with the Cleveland Browns .\n\nCoach Kirby Smart certainly relies on that heritage when he\u2019s trying to persuade a high school running back to sign with the Bulldogs.\n\n\u201cI think it helps tremendously to have the guys, the history of Robert Edwards, Garrison Hearst, Terrell Davis, I mean Herschel, just back after back after back after back,\u201d Smart said. \u201cNow it\u2019s probably more prominent than it\u2019s ever been because of the stage that Todd is on and what he\u2019s been able to do, and Nick and Sony\u2019s exposure last year through the national championship game.\n\nWhat does the coach tell prospective backs who are considering Georgia?\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a premier back in the country and you say, \u2018I want to go somewhere that I can learn to play in a pro style, catch the ball in the backfield, and I also want to be able to protect so that I can increase my value, and I also want to have durability where I\u2019m not going to be beat up when I come out of there,\u2019 there\u2019s nowhere better to go,\u201d Smart replied.\n\nIndeed, Georgia has relied on an abundance of talented running backs the last few seasons.\n\nPrevious coach Mark Richt was able to land Gurley and Keith Marshall in the same recruiting class \u2014 they were dubbed \u201cGurshall\u201d in a nod to Walker \u2014 though Marshall never realized his full potential because of injuries. Richt pulled off another double-coup when he landed Chubb and Michel.\n\nHolyfield, a junior, signed with the Bulldogs even though he knew he\u2019d spend at least one season playing behind Chubb and Michel (and it wound up being two when both stayed through their full eligibility). Swift came aboard last season, even with all those talented backs on the roster. Zamir White, touted as the nation\u2019s top prospects, signed with Georgia coming into this season but was sidelined by a knee injury .\n\nHolyfield said the competition for playing time makes everyone better. He leads the Bulldogs with 674 yards rushing, but Swift, who has battled injuries and finally seems to be at full strength, has gained 622 yards. Swift has also been an effective weapon in the passing game with 17 receptions for 161 yards.\n\n\u201cWhen you have somebody who\u2019s just as good as you playing next to you, it pushes you every single day,\u201d Holyfield said. \u201cI know I can\u2019t take a day off because he\u2019s not going to take a day off.\u201d\n\nGeorgia faces Auburn (6-3, 3-3) on Saturday in the 123rd renewal of the Deep South\u2019s oldest rivalry.\n\nThe Tigers certainly know what they\u2019re up against.\n\n\u201cSwift and Holyfield kind of resemble the backs they\u2019ve had in the past,\u201d defensive tackle Dontavius Russell said. \u201cIt\u2019s always a challenge.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Paul Newberry on Twitter at www.twitter.com/pnewberry1963 .

So as they continue to try to enforce the same rule, I think the consistency will grow. But right now, that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing some confusion.\u201d\n\nOn Oct. 21 at Tampa Bay, Mayfield slid after a 35-yard run and was drilled from the side by Buccaneers safety Jordan Whitehead, who wasn\u2019t flagged but was fined $26,739 fine by the NFL, which acknowledged days after the hit that it should have been a penalty.\n\nLast week, Kansas City safety Ron Parker delivered a glancing blow with his helmet to Mayfield while the quarterback was being wrapped up by defensive tackle Chris Jones. Again, no penalty was called, but Mayfield was forced to leave the game after an independent medical observer called the officials and requested the QB undergo a concussion evaluation.\n\nMayfield passed the test and was allowed to return three plays later. He fought to stay in the game.\n\n\u201cYeah. I guess that is the new rule,\u201d he said. \u201cI have to come off the field for a checkup.\u201d\n\nParker could be fined by the league, which announces its weekly punishments on Saturday.\n\nMayfield, the No. 1 overall pick in this year\u2019s draft, joked that Parker\u2019s hit fortunately didn\u2019t do any damage.\n\n\u201cIt would be more frustrating if it hurt,\u201d Mayfield said. \u201cI was more frustrated they took me out of the game, to be honest with you.

In Laredo, the city\u2019s mayor released a statement referring to the deployment as \u201cfalse efforts\u201d that will \u201charm morale and damage the economy of our region.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven though our communities are all very different and diverse, we all experience the same thing, which are the effects of militarization at the border,\u201d said Juan, who was one of several speakers at a news conference in Phoenix on Thursday. \u201cHaving an increased presence of military is scary, you know. It\u2019s scary.\u201d\n\nJuan is a member of the Tohono O\u2019odham Nation, which sits on about 75 miles along the international border. Residents of the reservation have long had a complicated relationship with the U.S. Border Patrol, and its leadership has been vocal about its opposition to the president\u2019s plans for a border wall.\n\n\u201cI find the fact that the military is being deployed absolutely terrifying. The amount of militarization that we already experience on a daily basis and that we are currently living under is like living in a waking nightmare,\u201d said Eva Lewis, a resident of the small town of Arivaca just north of the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nMany residents of Arivaca have spent years battling the Border Patrol\u2019s checkpoints, which require everyone who cross them to stop and declare whether they are citizens. Trips to school or the grocery store require passing through checkpoints, and many residents say that agents discriminate against Latinos in the area, a claim the agency denies.\n\nIn Nogales, Arizona, which shares a name with its neighbor to the south, residents said they were distressed, confused and shocked when the military showed up on election day to install barbed wire on a border fence, according to the Nogales International newspaper.\n\nAs of Thursday, there are over 5,600 troops deployed at the border. There are 2,800 in Texas, while 1,500 are in Arizona and another 1,300 are in California.\n\nThe military expects to have most of the over 7,000 troops planned for the mission deployed by Monday. A spokesperson for the Department of Defense could not be reached Thursday.\n\nBut not everyone opposes the military presence.\n\nJim Chilton, an Arizona border rancher and staunch Trump supporter, said in a news release to the AP this week that he looks forward to the arrival of more troops. Chilton said the 25 miles of international border in Arivaca is poorly secured and actively sees drug smuggling and human trafficking.\n\n\u201cThe lack of access and infrastructure, cartel scout presence, and rough terrain and inefficient \u2018defense in depth\u2019 strategy creates a de facto \u2018no man\u2019s land\u2019 in which border ranchers live and work,\u201d Chilton said.\n\nDespite rhetoric about the Central American migrant caravan, illegal immigration to the U.S. is at historic lows, with only a fraction of arrests made by the Border Patrol \u2014 and twice the number of agents \u2014 made this year compared with 2000, at the height of illegal activity.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press reporter Lolita Baldor in Washington contributed to this report.", "FILE - In this Saturday, Nov. 3, 2018, file photo, West Virginia quarterback Will Grier (7) scores the game-winning, two-point conversion during an NCAA college football game against Texas in Austin, Texas.

(Nick Wagner/Austin American-Statesman via AP, File)\n\nThere are four legitimate contenders, three weekends of games and two big head-to-head matchups that should go a long way in determining the Big 12 championship game rematch.\n\nBig 12 co-leaders No. 6 Oklahoma (8-1, 5-1 Big 12, No. 6 CFP) and No. 7 West Virginia (7-1, 5-1, No. 9 CFP) still have to play each other in the regular season finale. No. 15 Texas (6-3, 4-2, No. 9 CFP) and No. 23 Iowa State (5-3, 4-2, No. 22 CFP), currently tied for third place, will play next week in Ames.\n\nThat leaves two other games for each of those teams, and chances for things to go awry while trying to reach the Dec. 1 title game in Arlington, Texas \u2014 and for the Sooners and Mountaineers maybe even a shot at the College Football Playoff.\n\nGoing into the final stretch of the Big 12 round-robin schedule \u2014 six conference games down, three to go for all 10 teams \u2014 here are some of the scenarios to get into the championship game:\n\nDIRECT PATH\n\nOklahoma, led by quarterback Kyler Murray , gets to play for its record-extending 12th Big 12 title with a sweep of the next three games. The Sooners, trying to be the first team ever to win four Big 12 championships in a row, will be heavy favorites against Oklahoma State and Kansas before the anticipated showdown in Morgantown.\n\nWill Grier, another Heisman Trophy contender, and West Virginia are in the same situation in being able to lock in a championship game berth with three more wins. The Mountaineers host TCU and go to Oklahoma State before hosting Oklahoma the day after Thanksgiving.\n\nIf the Sooners or Mountaineers can win out, including the title game \u2014 which could mean beating the same top 10 team in consecutive weeks \u2014 the Big 12 champion could be a viable one-loss option when the CFP selection committee meets to determine the national semifinal matchups.\n\nMIXED-UP RESULTS\n\nWith either Oklahoma or West Virginia guaranteed to have a second conference loss, and Texas or Iowa State (but not both) still able to finish with two losses, a tiebreaker could come into play to determine the second team going to play in the home stadium of the NFL\u2019s Dallas Cowboys. Texas would have the head-to-head tiebreaker over Oklahoma after beating the Sooners at the State Fair of Texas in early October. But the Longhorns lost at home to the Mountaineers when Grier ran for a game-winning 2-point conversion last week.\n\nThe Cyclones, who have a four-game winning streak with freshman quarterback Brock Purdy, lost to Oklahoma in their league opener Sept. 15. But they beat WVU 30-14, the only time the Mountaineers have scored fewer than 35 points. Texas plays at Texas Tech, and Iowa State is home against Baylor this Saturday. The Longhorns finish at Kansas, and the Cyclones against K-State.\n\nALL TIED UP\n\nWhile it would take an upset, or two or three, along with a certain combination of outcomes, the current top four teams could all finish 6-3 in conference play. That would send the Big 12 tiebreaker system into overdrive to figure out who would play for the league title without a CFP shot but a guaranteed New Year\u2019s Six Bowl slot. There was an even more far-fetched possibility last season, when six teams could have wound up 6-3. But that didn\u2019t happen, and no tiebreaker was needed to set up the title game matchup between 8-1 Oklahoma and 7-2 TCU.\n\nNEED A LOT OF CHAOS\n\nOnly Kansas and Kansas State (both 3-6, 1-5) have been mathematically eliminated from Big 12 title contention. Baylor and Texas Tech (5-4, 3-3) are guaranteed to play at the site of the championship game \u2014 they play each other at AT&T Stadium on Nov. 24. Either would need a lot of help to return there the following week. Both play Saturday against teams ahead of them in the standings. The Bears go to Iowa State, and the Red Raiders are home to play Texas.\n\nOklahoma State (5-4, 2-4) has a much better chance of playing spoiler \u2014 with games against Oklahoma and West Virginia \u2014 than getting to Arlington. The Cowboys, like TCU (4-5, 2-4), would have to win out \u2014 they play each other the last weekend \u2014 and need a lot of unlikely outcomes to be in the title mix.\n\nLET\u2019S GO BOWLING\n\nThe Big 12 has seven guaranteed bowl spots, and nine teams still could get to the six overall wins for bowl eligibility. There is a bowl elimination game Saturday in the Sunflower State. The Jayhawks-Wildcats loser will be the first Big 12 team with seven losses this season.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "FILE- In this Oct. 7, 2018, file photo, Oakland Raiders defensive end Bruce Irvin, center, reacts after sacking Los Angeles Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers during the first half of an NFL football game in Carson, Calif.

(AP) \u2014 Bruce Irvin has wanted to play for the Atlanta Falcons since he was a kid.\n\nNow that the seventh-year pass rusher is back home and about to make his Falcons debut, Irvin said he won\u2019t take this opportunity for granted.\n\nIt\u2019s a rebirth for a 31-year-old who acknowledges he made bad decisions as an Atlanta teenager and now gets a chance to rewrite his local legacy.\n\n\u201cYesterday it hit me a little bit,\u201d Irvin said Thursday. \u201cI know that I look scared but I really was crying yesterday, this is a childhood dream for me. Growing up, watching Michael Vick, and guys like Terance Mathis ... this was always my dream so for me to be able to come and live it out it was a surreal moment and I\u2019m just very fortunate to be an Atlanta Falcon right now.\u201d\n\nIrvin was cut last Saturday by Oakland, part of a housecleaning with the rebuilding Raiders. He cleared waivers and was a free agent with offers from several teams.\n\nHe never doubted where he wanted to land.\n\n\u201cMy agent said, \u2018You know everybody thinks you\u2019re going to Atlanta,\u2019 and I said under my breath, \u2018Well, they\u2019re right,\u2019\u201d Irvin said. \u201cSo it was no comparison, man. My family is here. My wife is from here. It was a childhood dream.\u201d\n\nIrvin said life passed him by growing up in nearby Stone Mountain. He watched friends from Stephenson High School \u2014 Perry Riley, Kelvin Sheppard and Jermaine Cunningham \u2014 focus on their football careers while he was getting having run-ins with law enforcement and constantly putting himself in danger.\n\n\u201cI was out in the streets doing stuff, and those guys were getting four-year scholarships to Florida and LSU and it hurt me,\u201d Irvin said. \u201cIt hurt me seeing those guys go off, and I was just around here doing God knows what. It was a motivating factor. Look at me now. I outlasted Perry and Jermaine (in the NFL). Sheppard just got on so, but it was a motivating factor. I\u2019m glad that I figured it out and got my head on straight.\u201d\n\nIrvin returned recently to Stephenson to meet with current students and offer some advice.\n\n\u201cLike I said, I never played at Stephenson,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t play football since the ninth grade and I didn\u2019t play for six years. Going back there and letting those young guys know that anything is possible. You can be in the worst situation and if you surround yourself by the right people and not around a bunch of yes-men, you can make it around anything. So that was the biggest thing.\u201d\n\nNow Irvin gets to show what he can do on the field. Before his first practice with the Falcons on Thursday, Irvin wanted to show his new teammates he can still be a force in disrupting the quarterback.\n\nIrvin will wear jersey No. 52 when the Falcons (4-4) take a three-game winning streak to (2-6-1). He intends to help Atlanta improve a pass rush that ranks 27th in sacks.\n\n\u201cI think I bring a lot of swagger, a lot of attitude,\u201d Irvin said. \u201cI speak my mind. I talk a lot of mess. Just running around having fun, man. That\u2019s the biggest thing in this league. If you\u2019re not having fun, it doesn\u2019t take you a long way. Me just bringing energy and knowledge to these guys. Just being the best Bruce Irvin I can be every day.\u201d\n\nThe 6-foot-3, 250-pound Irvin was a first-round draft pick for Seattle out of West Virginia in 2012. He played four seasons with the Seahawks and two-plus with the Raiders, and had 40 sacks. His 15 forced fumbles over that span lead the NFL.\n\n\u201cMe and DQ can\u2019t dwell on what we did in Seattle, going to the Super Bowl and things like that,\u201d Irvin said. \u201cIt\u2019s more about right now and I feel like they needed me. I wanted to be here. I did what I had to do.

(AP Photo/Mark Tenally, File)\n\nCLEVELAND (AP) \u2014 Quietly, steadily and with little fanfare, the Atlanta Falcons have gotten off the ground.\n\nThey\u2019re flying again \u2014 under the radar.\n\nDespite numerous injuries at vital positions, the Falcons have shaken off a 1-4 start and carry a three-game winning streak into Sunday\u2019s matchup with the Browns (2-6-1). Cleveland has changed coaches, dropped four in a row and is trying not to let another season spiral completely out of control.\n\nThe Falcons (4-4) are coming off their best performance this season, a well-rounded 38-14 thrashing of the Washington Redskins that has pushed them back into contention in the wild-card race. Atlanta coach Dan Quinn said the key to the team\u2019s turnaround has been persistence.\n\n\u201cThe main thing for us was the message to be real consistent, to stay the course,\u201d Quinn said this week. \u201cAlthough we got knocked down, defensively especially from the communication standpoint, we had to work hard to increase on that. There might be some new voices leading the way. We just tried to stay consistent with the guys. Make sure that we knew what we were doing was right and we had to do what we did better.\u201d\n\nNobody\u2019s doing it better than Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan, who is playing like he did as the league\u2019s MVP in 2016. Ryan has thrown 19 touchdown passes, only three interceptions, and is completing 71 percent of his passes. The 33-year-old leads the NFL with 335.6 yards passing per game, and he recently went 213 attempts between interceptions.\n\nMatty Ice is on fire.\n\n\u201cHe really is playing well. He is executing very well,\u201d said Browns interim coach and defensive coordinator Gregg Williams. \u201cYou can see the comfort zone that he has with (Falcons offensive coordinator) Steve (Sarkisian) in Year 2. That usually is the way that it is in our league.\u201d\n\nLast week, Ryan passed for 350 yards and four touchdowns, one to star receiver Julio Jones, who ended a 12-game scoreless drought and finished with seven catches for 121 yards.\n\nCleveland\u2019s defense will get another stiff test one week after dealing with Kansas City\u2019s high-flying aerial circus. Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs scored 34 in three quarters before coasting through the final 15 minutes.\n\nWilliams knows Ryan\u2019s capabilities after facing him twice a season while he was defensive coordinator in New Orleans. Back then, Williams could take chances and blitz a young Ryan. Those tricks don\u2019t work as well on a savvy veteran.\n\n\u201cI look at it as an older quarterback \u2014 you start to get into the double-digit years, plus years and stuff \u2014 the influence of whoever is coordinating him and whoever is coaching him, he is having some say in some things and doing some really, really good things,\u201d Williams said. \u201cHe is very accurate. Our work is going to be cut out for us. You can\u2019t fool those kinds of guys that many times.\u201d\n\nBROWNS DOWN\n\nCleveland\u2019s task of stopping Ryan, Jones and Co. got harder when starting linebacker Christian Kirksey and cornerback E.J. Gaines were lost to season-ending injuries.\n\nThe Browns should have rookie cornerback Denzel Ward and safety/corner Damarious Randall back from injuries. Randall may draw the assignment of covering Jones, who presents problems with his size and speed.\n\n\u201cBig, fast, strong. I mean, you name it,\u201d Randall said when asked to describe Jones. \u201cHe\u2019s pretty much what you want in your typical receiver nowadays. He\u2019s the guy that if you had to pick a receiver No. 1 in the league, I\u2019m pretty sure probably all 32 teams would pick Julio Jones.\u201d\n\nNEW RUNNING BACK TANDEM\n\nWith Devonta Freeman on injured reserve for at least six more weeks, Atlanta\u2019s distribution of carries has been unexpectedly balanced. Tevin Coleman is starting, but rookie Ito Smith\u2019s role is expanding. Proof came in last week\u2019s win when Coleman had 13 carries for 88 yards, and Smith added 10 for 60 yards and a touchdown.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s gotten better for us every week,\u201d Ryan said of Smith. \u201cI\u2019ve been really impressed with his growth from game to game. It\u2019s really cool to see that from young players, particularly rookies.\u201d\n\nGO, BAKER, GO\n\nThe Browns want rookie quarterback Baker Mayfield to cut it loose.\n\nMayfield was tough on himself after some missed throws last week, but Williams\u2019 said his message to the No. 1 pick this week was to only look forward.\n\n\u201cWe have his back. Now, let\u2019s go,\u201d Williams said. \u201cYou\u2019re a smart enough quarterback, instinctive enough quarterback. We understand that mistakes are going to be made. Don\u2019t be afraid of making mistakes. Just cut it loose and play, and make faster and faster decisions.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the No. 1 thing that I\u2019ve tried to convey to him.\u201d\n\nPERFECT FIT\n\nNewly signed defensive end Bruce Irvin is expected to make his Falcons debut. Quinn said Irvin will play as a pass-rush specialist in the nickel package.\n\nQuinn was Seattle\u2019s defensive coordinator for two seasons when Irvin played for the Seahawks. That familiarity, along with Irvin\u2019s desire to return to his hometown, helped the Falcons reach a deal when Irvin said he was offered more money elsewhere.\n\n\u201cI know Bruce,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cI\u2019ve known him for a long time. He\u2019ll fit in really well with this group.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Charles Odum contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "ALAMEDA, Calif.

That\u2019s probably going to happen 100 times a game.\u201d\n\nGuenther\u2019s statement echoed comments made earlier this week by Gruden, who joked that the two have bigger disagreements on the golf course.\n\nThe recent sideline exchanges between the coach and his hand-picked defensive coordinator have gotten more attention, however, as the Raiders have struggled through a 1-7 start.\n\nBoth Gruden and Guenther have come under fire from fans and the media.\n\nGruden has been targeted for the team\u2019s inconsistent offense and the radical roster changes being made, while Guenther\u2019s defense has been bad all season. The Raiders are on pace to give up 6,514 yards and are allowing opponents to gain a league-high 6.8 yards per play.\n\nWhile acknowledging frustration over the situation, Guenther \u2014 who spent the past 13 seasons in Cincinnati and was the Bengals\u2019 coordinator from 2014-17 \u2014 downplayed any suggestion of problems between him and Gruden.\n\n\u201cI love Jon, he\u2019s great to work with,\u201d Guenther said. \u201cWe\u2019re really trying to build this thing the right way and we have a vision for it.

Oakland\u2019s best run defender, Justin Ellis, was lost to injured reserve with a foot injury he suffered in Week 1.

Northwestern can clinch the Big Ten West championship and its first appearance in the conference title game by winning two of its final three games. (AP Photo/Jim Young)\n\nEVANSTON, Ill. (AP) \u2014 Northwestern came into the season with its star quarterback limited, lost its top running back early on, dropped three straight games and went winless in nonconference play.\n\nSounds like a recipe for one long season, except take a look at the Big Ten West standings. That\u2019s right, the Wildcats lead the lead the division.\n\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s been a really unique year,\u201d coach Pat Fitzgerald said.\n\nThe Wildcats (5-4, 5-1 Big Ten) can clinch the division title and their first appearance in the Big Ten championship simply by winning two of their final three games. They would also secure a spot Saturday with a victory at Iowa plus losses by Wisconsin at Penn State and Purdue at Minnesota.\n\nIt\u2019s quite a position for a team that wasn\u2019t widely considered a favorite to win its division, though Northwestern is hardly the only surprise in the Big Ten.\n\nWhether it\u2019s teams exceeding expectations or traditional powers not quite meeting them, it has been a wild season around the conference.\n\nNo. 8 Ohio State (8-1, 5-1) came into the season as a favorite to reach the playoffs, only to get blown out by Purdue two weeks ago. The Buckeyes also had to rally in the second half and then hang on for a five-point win at Nebraska this past Saturday.\n\nNo. 21 Penn State (6-3, 3-3) also had high expectations. But back-to-back tight losses to Ohio State and Michigan State and a blowout by Michigan last week doused their playoff hopes.\n\n\u201cOverall, we\u2019re disappointed with what happened last week and before that we\u2019d had two other challenging losses by a very, very narrow margin,\u201d coach James Franklin said. \u201cObviously, our team is disappointed whenever we\u2019re not successful. ... I think when we look back at the things we\u2019ve been able to accomplish in our short time here after walking into some challenging circumstances, I think overall I\u2019m excited about the direction.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s No. 4 Michigan (8-1, 6-0), picked by some to finish fourth in the Big Ten East behind the Buckeyes, Michigan State and Penn State. The Wolverines instead are a playoff contender and leading their division, with Ohio State second, Michigan State third and Penn State tied with Maryland for fourth place.\n\nIn the West, Wisconsin (6-3, 4-2) and Iowa (6-3, 3-3) haven\u2019t performed the way they hoped.\n\nPurdue (5-4, 4-2), looking to build on a bowl victory last season, looked like it was going in the tank with an 0-3 start. But the Boilermakers have won five of six to play their way into the running for the Big Ten West championship. They beat three ranked teams along the way for the first time in 15 years, including that stunning 29-point win over Ohio State.\n\nBuckle up for these next few weeks.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still three weeks away from really knowing how it\u2019s gonna end,\u201d Iowa coach Kirk Ferentz said. \u201cWe\u2019re still three weeks away from knowing how it\u2019s really gonna end. And there\u2019s gonna be a lot of twists and turns, just like the national (race). ... Things are gonna change dramatically between now and the finish line. But that\u2019s part of the intrigue of college football.\u201d\n\nIowa was looking like the most skilled team in the Big Ten West just a few weeks ago with a lengthy list of future pros. But back-to-back losses road losses to Penn State and Purdue have all but knocked the Hawkeyes out of the division race. A loss to Northwestern at home on Saturday would eliminate them.\n\nFor the Wildcats, Iowa would appear to be the final major hurdle.\n\nNorthwestern already has victories over Wisconsin and Purdue, and the final two games on the schedule are against struggling teams \u2014 at Minnesota and home against Illinois. Assuming they don\u2019t face-plant in the next few weeks, the Wildcats appear to have a clear path to Indianapolis for the Big Ten title game.\n\nThey\u2019re in that spot even though quarterback Clayton Thorson was limited the first few weeks because of a knee injury he suffered at the end of last season. No. 1 running back Jeremy Larkin had to stop playing football after the third game because of a spinal issue.\n\nNorthwestern also dropped three straight home games after the opener, including matchups with Duke and Akron before losing to Michigan. The Wildcats were also beaten by Notre Dame at Ryan Field last week, making them 0-3 in nonconference play.\n\nHad someone told Fitzgerald before the season that Northwestern would be in position to win its division despite all that?\n\n\u201cI would say that our guys would be pretty resilient, that they battled through adversity and there\u2019s no way in the world I could have predicted that,\u201d he said, laughing.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) \u2014 Kentucky\u2019s protracted legal fight over abortion is entering a new round involving the same combatants, but this time they\u2019ll be arguing over a second-trimester procedure to end pregnancies.\n\nLawyers for Kentucky\u2019s only abortion clinic will argue in federal court next week that a new state law amounts to an unconstitutional ban on a procedure they term the \u201csafest and most common method\u201d of second-trimester abortions. Critics called the procedure a form of dismemberment of a live fetus.\n\nSince assuming complete control of Kentucky\u2019s legislature in 2017, Republicans have pushed through measures putting limits and conditions on abortion. Two abortion-related laws, including one on the books for two decades, have been struck down in court since, but Republican Gov. Matt Bevin\u2019s administration has appealed both cases.\n\nBevin\u2019s administration sees the second-trimester procedure as a \u201cparticularly gruesome form of abortion,\u201d and the governor signed a restriction on that in April after the measure passed the state\u2019s GOP-dominated legislature. Though it took effect immediately, the measure spurred a quick legal challenge from the state\u2019s only remaining legal abortion clinic, EMW Women\u2019s Surgical Center in Louisville.\n\nWithin days, a federal judge suspended enforcement of the law pending the outcome of a trial that opens Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Louisville.\n\nIt\u2019s the latest in a series of abortion-related fights pitting Bevin\u2019s legal team against lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nPreviewing the upcoming trial, an attorney for the clinic said Thursday that the Kentucky law is an example of politicians inserting themselves into decisions that should be left to doctors and patients. The goal was to chip away at access to abortion, the attorney said.\n\n\u201cIn Kentucky, the impact of this law is that abortion would not be available after about 15 weeks in pregnancy if it were allowed to take effect,\u201d said Andrew Beck, senior staff attorney for the ACLU\u2019s Reproductive Freedom Project.\n\nBeck told reporters some women can\u2019t obtain abortions soon after making up their minds because of cost or difficulties of traveling to see a doctor.\n\nThe two sides are fighting over an abortion procedure known as \u201cdilation and evacuation.\u201d The procedure was used in 537 of 3,312 abortions done in Kentucky in 2016, according to state statistics.\n\nIn defending the new law, the state\u2019s legal team has focused in part on the nature of the procedure. In pre-trial briefs, they described it as the dismemberment of a fetus removed from the womb \u201cpiece by piece.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt should go without saying that the brutality of a D&E abortion performed on a still-living unborn human being runs contrary to the values of modern civilized society, where the strong are supposed to protect the weak,\u201d the state\u2019s lawyers said in a pre-trial brief.\n\nSteve Pitt, who leads the state\u2019s legal team, said in an interview Thursday that the state has a \u201clegitimate interest in protecting the rights and the dignity of unborn children. That\u2019s what this case is about.\u201d\n\nBeck predicted the state\u2019s lawyers will present a case built on \u201can intentional shock campaign of inflammatory rhetoric, provocative images and made-up terms.\u201d Without elaborating on the procedure, Beck said bans on D&E procedures are opposed by national medical groups and that the abortion method is considered safe.\n\nHe also noted that similar laws in a handful of other states were struck down by federal judges, though some cases are being appealed.\n\nAsked about those decisions, Pitt said: \u201cWe\u2019ll present a very strong case.\u201d\n\nThe state\u2019s lawyers say the law would allow use of the D&E procedure, but only after doctors employ a \u201cmore humane way\u201d to induce fetal death through another procedure. The clinic\u2019s lawyers question the safety and reliability of such pre-D&E methods.\n\n\u201cEven were there techniques that guaranteed demise, forcing plaintiffs to perform unnecessary ... procedures that their patients do not want and that carry increased risks while providing no medical benefits would violate their ethical duties as physicians,\u201d the clinic\u2019s lawyers said in a brief.\n\nOf two abortion-related laws struck down by the courts in the Bevin era, one would require doctors to perform ultrasounds and show fetal images to patients prior to abortions. The other, passed two decades ago, required a Kentucky abortion clinic to have written agreements with a hospital and ambulance service in case of medical emergencies. Bevin\u2019s administration cited that law in a fight that threatened the state\u2019s last abortion clinic.", "FILE - In this Nov. 4, 2018, file photo, Miami Dolphins coach Adam Gase, left, talks to defensive coordinator Matt Burke before the team's NFL football game against the New York Jets in Miami Gardens, Fla.

(AP) \u2014 Miami Dolphins defensive coordinator Matt Burke has spent the week patching up things, and not just because his unit is on pace to allow more yards than any team in franchise history.\n\nTwo-time Pro Bowl safety Reshad Jones mysteriously took himself out of last week\u2019s win over the New York Jets and watched the second half from the sideline. In the aftermath, coach Adam Gase said communication problems between Burke and players needed to be addressed.\n\n\u201cObviously there was some sort of disconnect,\u201d Burke said Thursday. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of conversations \u2014 the whole defense and myself, Reshad and myself, Adam and myself. I think we\u2019re all on the same page.\u201d\n\nJones declined to say why he became a spectator, but he apparently was unhappy with Burke\u2019s plan to rotate safeties against the Jets. Burke said he\u2019s confident that if the decision is for Jones to share playing time Sunday at Green Bay, the veteran will accept that.\n\nGase, who seemed to side with Jones in the aftermath of last week\u2019s standoff, agreed the issue has been resolved.\n\n\u201cWe did everything we need to get straightened out and moved on,\u201d Gase said. \u201cSometimes you have to go through all of this kind of stuff during a season. Sometimes it gets aired out publicly. That\u2019s the hardest thing about the NFL sometimes. You have to bounce back. We got what we needed fixed, and we\u2019re moving on to the next game.\u201d\n\nJones has been a starter for Miami since 2011 and a defensive leader. Burke said he doesn\u2019t believe Jones\u2019 standing within the team has been harmed.\n\n\u201cI know he has had conversations with his teammates on how he\u2019s going to move forward,\u201d Burke said. \u201cI don\u2019t see an issue with that.\u201d\n\nEven if the matter is now in the rearview mirror, Burke has plenty of other problems. The Dolphins held the woeful Jets without a touchdown , but before that their defense had been awful for several weeks in a row.\n\nThey rank 26th in league overall, 28th in run defense and 22nd in pass defense. They\u2019re allowing 394 yards per game, more than the team\u2019s record-high average of 383 in 2016, the year before Burke became coordinator.\n\nThe Dolphins have allowed 107 points in their past three road games, and now they visit Aaron Rodgers and the Packers , who are ranked sixth in offense.\n\nRodgers, ever the pro, managed to find nice things to say about Miami\u2019s defensive, specifically Jones\u2019 secondary.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve made a lot of plays on the ball,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cThey do a nice disguise package. They play some different coverages behind some of their pressures.\u201d\n\nThe saving grace for the Dolphins\u2019 defense is that they have 15 interceptions, including four last week. They\u2019re on pace to the lead the league for the first time in franchise history.\n\nBurke believes that for his defense, the best is yet to come.\n\n\u201cI hope so,\u201d he said. \u201cHope is not a strategy, but you hope the trend from last week is where we\u2019re heading more than weeks prior. If we execute and perform the way we performed last week, we\u2019ll have a chance to put a decent showing together.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Genaro Armas contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\n___\n\nFollow Steven Wine on Twitter: http://twitter.com/Steve_Wine.", "FILE - In this Sunday, Nov. 4, 2018, file photo, Kevin Harvick's pit crew services his car during the NASCAR Cup auto race at Texas Motor Speedway in Fort Worth, Texas. Harvick's bid for a second NASCAR title suffered a massive setback when he was stripped of his berth in the championship race after series inspectors found his winning car from Texas Motor Speedway had been deliberately altered to give him a performance advantage. (AP Photo/Larry Papke, File)\n\nAVONDALE, Ariz. (AP) \u2014 The credo in NASCAR has always been \u201cIf you ain\u2019t cheatin\u2019, you ain\u2019t tryin\u2019,\u201d and that has never changed despite series effort to keep things on the up-and-up.\n\nNow that culture has resurfaced again and at a most inopportune time for the beleaguered series.\n\nThere is one race to go to set the championship field, Sunday in Phoenix, and star driver Kevin Harvick has been snared in the latest scandal. NASCAR found Harvick had an illegal race-winning car \u2014 his second of the season \u2014 after his victory at Texas Motor Speedway earned him an automatic berth in the Nov. 18 title race in Florida.\n\nThe issue was with a spoiler that had been modified to give Harvick an aerodynamic advantage as he dominated and won for a Cup Series-high eighth time this season. Just how much of an advantage Harvick had is irrelevant: The levels of deceit NASCAR believes Stewart-Haas Racing went to were so devious the intent can\u2019t be questioned.\n\nOnce NASCAR had the car back from Texas and in its Research and Development Center, the spoiler was removed and determined not to be the part supplied by the vendor. Instead, NASCAR believes SHR made its own spoiler, passed it off as one from the mandatory vendor and used it to help Harvick win.\n\nThe details were unveiled late Wednesday, 10 hours after Harvick\u2019s spot in the finale was revoked. NASCAR has for several years refused to give specifics about infractions \u2014 keeping secret ideas on how to game the system \u2014 but reversed course on the Harvick penalty because of mounting criticism about the severity of his punishment. Not only did Harvick lose his spot in the final four at Homestead-Miami Speedway, but he must race the final two weeks of the season without his crew chief and car chief.\n\nScott Miller, NASCAR\u2019s senior vice president of competition, said he felt SHR took the notion of pushing boundaries and exploring technology \u201cinto borderline ridiculous territory.\u201d\n\nWith the stakes so high this weekend at Phoenix, where seven drivers will by vying for three open spots in the championship race, NASCAR will check spoilers at the track.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that now we\u2019ll be pulling spoilers off and having to do another inspection when the teams should really be bringing legal cars to the race track,\u201d Miller said.\n\nSHR has not challenged NASCAR\u2019s cheating allegation. The team said it would not appeal the penalty and vice president of competition Greg Zipadelli said in a statement \u201cNASCAR determined we ventured into an area not accommodated by its rule book.\u201d The team has not made any members available for comment, and Harvick is not scheduled to speak to the media at Phoenix, where he is a nine-time winner. One of his victories came in the spring, part of a three-race winning streak marred by an illegal car at Las Vegas one week earlier.\n\nThe latest infraction raises questions about whether SHR has \u201cventured into an area not accommodated\u201d by NASCAR\u2019s rulebook with its other drivers. Its entire four-car lineup \u2014 Harvick, Kurt Busch, Clint Bowyer and Aric Almirola \u2014 is still eligible for the title race.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just SHR last weekend, either. NASCAR took three cars back to its R&D Center after Texas and all three failed teardown inspections. Ryan Blaney\u2019s team was punished and so was the team for Erik Jones.\n\nIf the only three cars inspected failed, what about the other 37 cars in Sunday\u2019s field?\n\n\u201cWe certainly can\u2019t bring the 40-car field back to R&D,\u201d Miller said, elaborating on how issues get missed at the track. \u201cWe\u2019re under time constraints at the race track to do these inspections. We have small windows and tight windows to get the inspections done, and we might spend in the neighborhood of five minutes with each of the 40 cars for the three-hour window that we have for inspection. To think that we can scrutinize a car as good in five minutes and we can in three hours at the R&D Center is a bit unrealistic.\u201d\n\nThe last big scandal in NASCAR was in 2013, when Michael Waltrip Racing manipulated the finish of a race at Richmond to try to get Martin Truex Jr. into the playoffs. It led to a larger NASCAR investigation that uncovered at least one other case of race manipulation.\n\nThe latest scandal may be the tipping point for a revamped penalty system next season. Miller said the sanctioning body will look during the offseason at tougher penalties if a team that can\u2019t even pass the first round of inspection.\n\n\u201cWe realize that we kind of probably need to ramp up the severity of what goes on at the race track, and we\u2019re hoping that we can change the culture to where we don\u2019t have to play this cat-and-mouse game with the teams all the time,\u201d Miller said.\n\nWhat happens if a car fails inspection after winning the title? It wasn\u2019t until Wednesday morning, long after Sunday\u2019s race, that NASCAR revealed Harvick\u2019s car had failed inspection.\n\nMiller vowed intense scrutiny on the four championship-contending cars at Homestead, and said the post-race procedure is similar to the Daytona 500, where engines are examined at the track after the race.\n\n\u201cKnowing that so much is on the line, we can concentrate on those cars a little bit more than we can the 40-car field during the regular season,\u201d Miller said. \u201cSo we\u2019ll just ramp up the intensity of keeping people with eyes on those cars throughout the weekend and scrutinize those cars heavily, both before and after the race.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP Auto Racing: https://apnews.com/apf-AutoRacing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) \u2014 Police in Des Moines say they have arrested a suspected driver of a cement truck who ran from the scene after plowing into a van and then a house, seriously injuring one person.\n\nThe Des Moines Register reports that the crash happened Thursday morning when the cement truck ran two stop lights and hit the van.

His 64 was his lowest opening round on tour since a 64 in the 2017 Phoenix Open.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an amazing resort, Mayakoba.

That made Ancer the first Mexican golfer to crack the top 100 in the world ranking, and he carried that to his native soil and kept moving in the right direction.\n\nAlso at 65 were Bud Cauley as he returns from a car accident at the Memorial in early June, and defending champion Patton Kizzire, who made back-to-back eagles on the par-5 fifth hole and by holing out on the par-4 sixth.\n\nRickie Fowler was among those at 66.\n\nKuchar has slipped to No. 40 in the world, failed to reach the third round of the FedEx Cup playoffs for the first time in a decade and did not play in the Ryder Cup for the first time in 10 years. He still keeps upbeat on and off the golf course, and decided while in Las Vegas (a tie for 57th) to play Mayakoba.\n\nHis caddie already had other plans, so Kuchar hired a local caddie from El Camaleon.\n\nHis wife, Sybi, also got in on the act. Kuchar was playing with Zach Johnson, whose caddie (Damon Green) became ill from the heat with four holes to play.

Kyrsten Sinema\u2019s bid for a U.S. Senate seat in Arizona and Gina Ortiz Jones\u2019 race for a U.S. House seat in Texas.\n\nHill, Davids and Craig were among a batch of Democratic winners who flipped control of GOP-held House seats, overcoming initial skepticism that LGBT candidates were not best-suited for that challenge.\n\n\u201cWe saw LGBTQ candidates talk openly about their lives to a degree unseen in past elections \u2014 and it resonated with voters,\u201d Parker said.\n\nIn Minnesota, Craig featured her wife and their sons in TV ads en route to winning a rematch against GOP Rep. Jason Lewis in the Twin Cities\u2019 suburban 2nd District.\n\n\u201cWhat I say is my wife and I have four sons, just like any other politician would,\u201d Craig said during the campaign. \u201cIt\u2019d be cool to be the first openly gay member of Congress from Minnesota, but that\u2019s not why I\u2019m running.\u201d\n\nIn Kansas\u2019 3rd District, near Kansas City, Davids unseated four-term GOP incumbent Kevin Yoder. Being lesbian was only one aspect of an eye-catching biography \u2014 she\u2019s also Native American, a lawyer, a former White House fellow, and a past competitor in mixed martial arts.\n\n\u201cFrom the beginning, this campaign has been built on bringing new leaders to the table, and new voices to the table,\u201d she said in her victory speech.\n\nIn New Hampshire, Pappas did not stress his LGBT status during the campaign, but reacted with passion during a debate when his GOP rival, Eddie Edwards, questioned why Pappas had been photographed wearing a \u201cResist\u201d T-shirt.\n\n\u201cThe photo you are referring to is a rainbow shirt I wore at a gay pride event,\u201d Pappas said. \u201cI am proud of who I am and I am proud to stand up against hate, bigotry and intolerance.\u201d\n\nIn Colorado, which was beset by gay-rights controversies in the past, Polis\u2019 successful campaign for governor was striking in that his LGBT status never became a campaign issue.\n\n\u201cWe went from a state where our elected officials struggled to provide even basic rights to same-sex couples to a state where a gay man ran for governor and his sexual orientation wasn\u2019t discussed as a political liability,\u201d The Denver Post wrote in an editorial.\n\nKayla DeShon, an independent voter from the Denver suburb of Highlands Ranch, said she voted for Polis because of his stance on health care.\n\n\u201cI did not know he is gay. I found out afterward \u2014 it was an added bonus,\u201d said DeShon, 29. \u201cAnd I do think that it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nPolis will join Oregon\u2019s Kate Brown as the only LGBT governors. Brown, who identifies as bisexual, narrowly won re-election over Republican Knute Buehler.\n\nIn state legislative races, the Victory Fund projects that about 130 LGBT candidates will win seats \u2014 all but two of them Democrats. That would be up from 121 LGBT legislators heading into the election, according to the fund.\n\nWinning a state Senate seat in Utah was Derek Kitchen, a city councilor in Salt Lake City who rose to prominence when his lawsuit overturned Utah\u2019s ban on gay marriage several years ago. Voters in Omaha elected an openly bisexual candidate, Megan Hunt, to the Nebraska Senate.\n\nIn New Hampshire, two transgender women, Gerri Cannon and Lisa Bunker, won seats in the state House of Representatives.\n\nA third transgender woman, Brianna Titone, was locked in a too-close-to-call race for the Colorado House. Unofficial near-complete returns showed Titone with a 12-vote lead after more than 47,000 votes were cast.\n\nAmong LGBT victors elsewhere was Dana Nessel, elected as Michigan\u2019s attorney general. Nessel made headlines as co-counsel in the historic lawsuit that led to same-sex marriage in Michigan.\n\nShe said the outgoing GOP attorney general, Bill Schuette, \u201cmade a mockery of state government\u201d by bringing social scientists to court to denigrate the parenting skills of same-sex couples.\n\n\u201cThere are LGBTQ people clamoring for representation and tired of the office of attorney general using them as a punching bag,\u201d Nessel said during the campaign.\n\nIn Massachusetts, voters soundly defeated an attempted repeal of a 2016 state law extending nondiscrimination protections to transgender people in the use of restrooms and other public accommodations.\n\nThe outcome was hailed by Parker, who was mayor of Houston in 2015 when a trans-inclusive civil-rights ordinance was repealed in a referendum. Opponents of the ordinance played upon public fears with the slogan, \u201cNo Men in Women\u2019s Bathrooms.\u201d\n\nParker said Massachusetts voters, having lived with the state law for two years, didn\u2019t buy such rhetoric.\n\n\u201cThey realized it was completely inane fear,\u201d she said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer James Anderson in Denver contributed to this report.\n\n__\n\nFollow David Crary at https://twitter.com/CraryAP", "STILLWATER, Okla.

(AP Photo/John Locher)\n\nEven during the years that Fresno State has been a power program in the West, it\u2019s never found a way to get the best of Boise State on the blue turf. The only time the Bulldogs have ever beaten the Broncos in Boise, the field was still green.\n\nThis may be the best opportunity for the 16th-ranked Bulldogs to finally end their skid when they face Boise State on Friday night. Fresno State has joined Central Florida and Utah State among the best of the Group of Five teams and the most likely to land in one of the New Year\u2019s Six bowl games.\n\n\u201cI think their team is really good and it\u2019s very loud there and it\u2019s a hostile environment but the color of the turf, I hope we\u2019re not looking down at the turf,\u201d Fresno State coach Jeff Tedford said.\n\nTaking down the Broncos would provide Fresno State (8-1, 5-0 MWC) with a little bit of redemption for last year\u2019s 17-14 loss to Boise State in the Mountain West championship game. More importantly, it would keep the Bulldogs in line for a possible conference title game clash with No. 14 Utah State with the winner potentially landing a big-money bowl opportunity should UCF stumble in the final month.\n\nFresno State has thumped its opponents by an average margin of victory of 32.5 points, but it hasn\u2019t faced the best competition yet. The Bulldogs\u2019 nine opponents have a combined record of 35-49.\n\nWhile most of the bigger implications involve the Bulldogs, a win by Boise State (7-2, 4-1) would keep the Broncos in line for a matchup with Utah State in the regular-season finale \u2014 also in Boise \u2014 and that could land the Broncos back in the conference title game for the second straight year and third time overall.\n\n\u201cJust a very good team. Very solid in what they do. And they\u2019ve been very consistent in what they do week in and week out,\u201d Boise State coach Bryan Harsin said.\n\nHere are other things to know about the 21st matchup between the schools:\n\nSOMETHING ABOUT MCMARYION: Fresno State QB Marcus McMaryion is quietly having one of the best seasons of any quarterback in the country. McMaryion is ninth in the country in passer rating at 165.4. He\u2019s thrown 20 touchdowns against just three interceptions and has added another seven touchdowns running. He struggled last year in the Mountain West title game against Boise State, completing just 16 of 34 passes and throwing an interception in the 17-14 loss.\n\nRYP IT: Boise State quarterback Brett Rypien will likely place himself at the top of the Mountain West all-time passing records against the Bulldogs. Rypien needs 36 yards passing to become the conference\u2019s career passing leader. Rypien has 12,655 yards, trailing only San Diego State\u2019s Ryan Lindley on the conference all-time list. Rypien also needs just five completions to pass Lindley for the most completed passes in conference history. Rypien has 957 in his career.\n\nSTRENGTH VS. STRENGTH: The Bulldogs bring the No. 1 scoring defense, passing defense and third-down defense to the blue turf to face a Boise State passing attack that is tops in the conference and ranks 11th nationally. The Bulldogs have built their resume stopping the pass against some of the weaker passing teams in the Mountain West. The Broncos will provide a major test for Fresno State\u2019s pass defense, which ranks 15th nationally.\n\nINJURY WORRIES: Boise State lost leading tackler Riley Whimpey to a torn ACL suffered in last week\u2019s win over BYU. He\u2019s the third defensive starter to be lost for the season, joining defensive tackle David Moa and safety DeAndre Pierce.\n\nHOME DOG: Ever since Boise State\u2019s run of dominance started in the early 2000s, the Broncos have been overwhelming favorites anytime they\u2019re playing at home. It makes Fresno State being a 3-point favorite this week notable. According to Oddsshark.com, the last time Boise State was an underdog at home for a regular-season conference game was Oct. 23, 1999 against Nevada. The Broncos were 2-point underdogs. They beat Nevada 52-17. The Broncos were home underdogs three times in the 1999 season and won all three games.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., speaks in during a news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington, Wednesday, Nov. 7, 2018.

Scott Applewhite)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Newly ascendant Democrats are promising congressional action on gun control amid a rash of mass shootings, including a late-night assault at a California bar that killed 12 people.\n\nMeasures including expanded background checks and a ban on assault-style weapons are likely to reach the House floor when Democrats retake control after eight years of Republican rule.\n\n\u201cThe American people deserve real action to end the daily epidemic of gun violence that is stealing the lives of our children on campuses, in places of worship and on our streets,\u201d said Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader who is running for a second stint as House speaker.\n\nPelosi vowed to push for a range of actions to stem gun violence, including restrictions on high-capacity magazines and a measure allowing temporary removal of guns from people deemed an imminent risk to themselves or others.\n\nThe measures could win approval in the Democratic-controlled House next year but will face opposition from the Republican-controlled Senate and the White House, where President Donald Trump has promised to \u201cprotect the Second Amendment.\u201d\n\nStill, gun control advocates believe they have the political momentum to make guns a central issue next year.\n\nThe political calculus on guns is changing, said Democratic Rep. Ted Deutch, whose Florida district includes the Parkland high school where 17 people were killed in February.\n\n\u201cWe saw it start on Tuesday and we\u2019re going to see it accelerate in January,\u201d he said.\n\nGun control was a major issue even before the most recent shootings. Lawmakers debated action following the Parkland attack and a 2017 shooting in Las Vegas that left 58 dead, and ultimately took modest steps to boost school safety funds and improve compliance with the federal background check system for gun purchases.\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 new majority includes dozens of candidates who support gun control, including Lucy McBath in Georgia, whose 17-year-old son was fatally shot in 2012 and who made gun violence the centerpiece of her campaign\n\nAt least 17 newly elected House Democrats back stricter gun laws, including Jennifer Wexton, Abigail Spanberger and Elaine Luria in Virginia, who defeated incumbents backed by the National Rifle Association. In Colorado, Democrat Jason Crow beat GOP Rep. Mike Coffman, who received an A rating from the NRA and more than $37,000 in campaign contributions from the group.\n\n\u201cI do think there\u2019s new energy\u201d on gun issues, even before the California assault late Wednesday night and an Oct. 27 shooting that killed 11 people at a Pittsburgh synagogue, said Kris Brown, co-president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence.\n\n\u201cOur base is worked up, and people are reacting in a positive way at the ballot box,\u201d said Brown, who campaigned with the three Virginia Democrats in the final week alongside a stream of volunteers. \u201cA large number of folks showed up and knocked on doors and said they finally have a candidate who will do something about gun violence,\u201d she said.\n\nWexton, Spanberger and Luria all made gun violence a central issue in their campaigns \u2014 disproving the notion that gun control is a \u201cthird rail\u201d of politics that Democrats should not talk about, Brown said. \u201cWe\u2019re finding candidates who aren\u2019t afraid to talk about this issue,\u201d she said.\n\nSpending to support candidates backing tougher gun control surged this year, even as campaign spending by the NRA declined. Everytown for Gun Safety, a group founded by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, pledged $30 million for this year\u2019s elections and continued to put new money into competitive races in the final days. A political action committee formed by Gabby Giffords, the former Arizona congresswoman wounded in a shooting, spent nearly $5 million.\n\nSixty-one percent of voters who responded to VoteCast, a survey of the electorate conducted by The Associated Press, said they support stricter gun laws, compared with 8 percent who said they should be loosened. Eighty-six percent of those supporting Democratic candidates backed stricter gun laws, along with 34 percent of those who supported Republicans.\n\nMcBath said her victory over Republican Rep. Karen Handel sent a strong message to the country. \u201cAbsolutely nothing \u2014 no politician & no special interest \u2014 is more powerful than a mother on a mission,\u201d she said in a tweet.\n\nMcBath, an African-American, became a spokeswoman for Everytown for Gun Safety after her son was slain at a Florida gas station by a white man angry over the loud music the black teenager and his friends had been playing in their car.\n\nWhile encouraged by the election results, gun control advocates know that getting any kind of weapons or ammunition ban signed into law will be difficult if not impossible in the next Congress.\n\nRepublicans expanded their Senate majority Tuesday and Trump remains a favored ally of the NRA.\n\nBut if the House votes to approve gun control and a bill is pending in the Senate, \u201cit\u2019s harder to ignore,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWe can keep the pressure on.\u201d\n\nDeutch said gun control opponents would be wise to heed Tuesday\u2019s results.\n\nFor years, GOP lawmakers thought they could avoid talking about gun control while accepting campaign contributions from the NRA and promoting an A rating from the group, he said. \u201cThey learned this week that just won\u2019t work anymore,\u201d Deutch said.", "PHILADELPHIA (AP) \u2014 The Philadelphia Orchestra has announced it received $4.7 million from a retired teacher and longtime supporter of the orchestra \u2014 a gift an orchestra official called \u201ca godsend.\u201d\n\nRetired Abington-area music teacher Jane Kesson died at age 90 last year and friends said they expected her to leave something in her will to the orchestra \u2014 but not a multimillion-dollar donation.

The Packers are hoping to bounce back from losses to the Rams and Patriots when they host the Miami Dolphins on Sunday(AP Photo/Charles Krupa, File)\n\nGREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) \u2014 One team is starting a backup at quarterback but still above .500. The other boasts one of the NFL\u2019s best quarterbacks, yet has a losing record.\n\nIt\u2019s a topsy-turvy matchup when the Miami Dolphins visit the Green Bay Packers on Sunday.\n\nBrock Osweiler will make a fifth straight start at quarterback for the Dolphins with Ryan Tannehill nursing a shoulder injury . Two-time NFL MVP Aaron Rodgers seems to be getting healthier after hurting his left knee in the Packers\u2019 season opener against the Chicago Bears.\n\nAdvantage Packers on offense, at least on paper.\n\nYet for whatever reasons, what should be a prolific unit isn\u2019t clicking consistently for the Packers (3-4-1), especially in the fourth quarters of their last two losses.\n\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s definitely frustrating, especially when you\u2019ve got the talent we do,\u201d receiver Davante Adams said. \u201cWe just need a little bit of flow and consistency, and I think that\u2019s what\u2019s going to get this offense moving in the right direction.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s little consolation that the losses have come against two of the league\u2019s best teams, the Rams and Patriots . Miscues on special teams, offense and defense have caught up to the Packers to contribute to the stinging defeats.\n\nGreen Bay may need a \u201crun the table\u201d type of streak to get into the postseason. That phrase uttered by Rodgers turned into a catchword in 2016 when the Packers won eight straight games to go from 4-6 to the NFC title game.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re focused on winning No. 4. That\u2019s all we\u2019re talking about right now,\u201d coach Mike McCarthy said. \u201cWe improved as a football team the last two weeks, but you have to play your best football coming down the stretch, and that\u2019s clearly been evident the last two weeks.\u201d\n\nThe Dolphins (5-4) relied on a resilient defense to beat the struggling New York Jets 13-6. Miami had four interceptions and four sacks while holding the Jets to 2 of 15 on third and fourth downs.\n\nIt\u2019s a nice cushion with Osweiler making another start. The Dolphins are 2-2 with Osweiler behind center, averaging 22 points a game.\n\n\u201cAny time you play a quarterback that\u2019s as special as Aaron is, you want to limit the amount of possessions that he\u2019s able to have,\u201d Osweiler said. \u201cWe know offensively this week it\u2019s very important for us to sustain drives, get first downs and try to be in control of that clock.\u201d\n\nOther notes and things to watch:\n\nRUN THE DRAKE?\n\nKenyan Drake had only three carries for the Dolphins last week, while starter Frank Gore carried 20 times.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to be that far apart,\u201d coach Adam Gase said. \u201cThere were a few opportunities where we were trying to do certain things with Kenyan that didn\u2019t work out the way we wanted to where we were trying to get him the ball.\u201d\n\nDrake is averaging 4.8 yards per carry, but he has had six or fewer in five of Miami\u2019s nine games. For the season he has 73 carries to 104 for the 35-year-old Gore.\n\nROOKIE RECEIVER\n\nA groin injury to Geronimo Allison means more opportunities for Marquez Valdes-Scantling. The fifth-round draft pick out of South Florida has shown potential to be a stretch-the-field threat with his speed and 6-foot-4 frame. Valdes-Scantling is averaging a team-best 21.1 yards per catch. He could be a beneficiary of more targets if the Dolphins decide to double Adams, the Packers\u2019 top wideout.\n\nSAFETY SHUFFLE\n\nReshad Jones will be back in the lineup for the Dolphins after the two-time Pro Bowl safety took himself out of last week\u2019s win over the Jets. Gase said that communication problems between defensive coordinator Matt Burke and players need to be addressed. Still, the defense last week was better after three straight poor games.\n\nSAFETY SHUFFLE, PART 2\n\nThe Packers have done a midseason shuffle at safety. The moves began with the trade of Ha Ha Clinton-Dix to Washington last week.\n\nKentrell Brice was limited at midweek with a knee injury, while Jermaine Whitehead was released this week. Veteran cornerback Tramon Williams was moved to safety against the Rams, but could be needed back at cornerback against Miami because of Kevin King\u2019s hamstring injury. Green Bay picked up safety Ibraheim Campbell off waivers from the New York Jets this week, while second-year player Josh Jones figures to see more snaps after being slowed by injury earlier this year.\n\nTURNOVER TIME\n\nThe four picks of Jets rookie Sam Darnold last week gave Miami a league-high 15 interceptions. Now the Dolphins face Rodgers, who has thrown one pick this season.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve made a lot of plays on the ball. They do a nice disguise package,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cGuys with vision to the football, which means you always have to be smart about your eye discipline.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Steven Wine contributed.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "LAS CRUCES, N.M.

(AP) \u2014 A woman\u2019s testimony describing graphic details of what she says was sexual harassment at the hands of Kentucky\u2019s former House speaker will remain hidden from the public \u2014 at least for a while.\n\nThursday, Franklin Circuit Judge Phillip Shepherd temporarily sealed portions of the woman\u2019s testimony that he says describes \u201callegations of boorish behavior and inappropriate physical contact\u201d between the woman and Republican state Rep. Jeff Hoover, the former House speaker.\n\nShepherd ruled it wasn\u2019t fair for the woman to make the allegations in a publicly available deposition without giving an attorney for Hoover and others the chance to also question her. But it\u2019s unclear if Hoover\u2019s attorney, Leslie Vose, even wants to question the woman, a former employee of the House Republican Caucus who has asked not to be identified.\n\nLast year, the woman signed a confidential settlement with four Republican lawmakers and another caucus employee. They agreed to pay her $110,000 in return for her not speaking publicly about the allegations. But the settlement was revealed by the Courier Journal, and it was eventually released to the public earlier this year as part of proceedings before the Legislative Ethics Commission.\n\nAfter the settlement became known, two state employees \u2014 House Republican Caucus Communications Director Daisy Olivo and former House Clerk Brad Metcalf \u2014 filed lawsuits alleging GOP lawmakers punished them for reporting the harassment.\n\nLast month, as part of those lawsuits, the woman who originally made the accusations testified in a lengthy deposition where attorneys say she detailed multiple instances of inappropriate behavior, including \u201cunwanted touching.\u201d Hoover and the other Republican lawmakers are not part of that lawsuit, so their lawyer was not present to ask questions. Once the deposition was completed, attorneys for Olivo and Metcalf attempted to file it with the court, making it a public document.\n\nThat\u2019s when an attorney for three of the Republican lawmakers asked the judge to redact about 400 lines from the 269-page transcript. Vose argued those details must be hidden from the public because the woman is bound by the confidential legal settlement she signed last year.\n\nThursday, Shepherd ruled the confidential settlement \u201cdoes not \u2014 and in the Court\u2019s judgment, cannot \u2014 bar her testimony under oath as a witness under subpoena in this related lawsuit.\u201d He also noted court rules allow for depositions to be sealed if someone can show \u201cgood cause\u201d to \u201cprevent annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense.\u201d\n\nBut instead of deciding whether portions of the transcript should be sealed, Shepherd said an attorney for the Republican lawmakers should ask the woman questions under oath sometime in the next 30 days. Shepherd ruled the deposition would automatically become public 10 days after that happens, unless the court rules otherwise.\n\nGail Langendorf, an attorney who represents the woman who made the accusations, said they have not decided how to respond. But, she said testifying a second time would be an \u201cundue burden\u201d for her client.\n\n\u201cIf they wanted to challenge the allegations, they could have litigated the case. But they settled,\u201d Langendorf said. \u201cShe wants to move on with her life.\u201d\n\nVose, the attorney who represents the three Republican lawmakers, did not return a phone call seeking comment.\n\nShane Sidebottom, an attorney who represents Olivo and Metcalf, said he would wait until Vose and her clients decide about whether to question the woman.\n\nAlthough Hoover resigned as House speaker, he kept his seat in the state House of Representatives. He was re-elected on Tuesday without opposition. He has denied sexually harassing the woman, but said he did send her inappropriate but consensual text messages.\n\nThe other Republican lawmakers named in the settlement \u2014 Michael Meredith, Jim DeCesare and Brian Linder \u2014 also are still in the legislature.

So far, they\u2019ve aced it.\n\nNow they face their biggest challenge: Jacksonville\u2019s daunting defense.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need any incentive. It\u2019s the NFL, we go out there, it\u2019s our job to protect the quarterback,\u201d longtime left tackle Anthony Castonzo said. \u201cThe past is the past, we\u2019re going to try the best we can.\u201d\n\nJust about anything would be an upgrade over what\u2019s happened lately against the Jaguars.\n\nWhen these teams previously met, late last season, the Jaguars finished with four sacks \u2014 a significant improvement over the 10 sacks Indy allowed six weeks earlier last season.\n\nThose 14 sacks accounted for more than one-fourth of Indy\u2019s season total, showing general manager Chris Ballard where the Colts needed to focus their attention to get back into the division race.\n\nBallard found two starters in the draft, left guard Quenton Nelson in the first round and right tackle Braden Smith in the second. He added right guard Matt Slauson in free agency. Center Ryan Kelly returned to form following an injury-filled 2017 season, and even after Slauson went down with a back injury the Colts have managed to find solid replacements.\n\nAs a result, Andrew Luck has been sacked just 10 times all season, none in his past 154 attempts \u2014 the longest stretch of his pro career.\n\nThe improvement can\u2019t be measured by pass protection alone. Marlon Mack rushed for career highs each of the past two weeks and has given Indy (3-5) its first back-to-back 100-yard rushing games since 2007.\n\nStill, the Colts know they are far from perfect and careful study of last year\u2019s two game tapes reveal just how quickly Jacksonville\u2019s defense can expose their lingering flaws.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you what our weaknesses are but this is going to be a big week coming off the bye,\u201d Castonzo said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be tightening the screws on the things that we can.\u201d\n\nBut this Jacksonville team doesn\u2019t resemble the one that reached last year\u2019s AFC championship game, either.\n\nDespite being ranked No. 1 against the pass and No. 2 in total defense, only seven teams have fewer sacks than the Jags (19) and only three teams have produced fewer turnovers (seven).\n\nIt explains why the Jags (3-5) have lost four straight and, like the Colts, are 2\u00bd games behind division leader Houston.\n\nCoach Doug Marrone doesn\u2019t expect this week\u2019s challenge to get any easier, especially against an opponent hoping to ace its biggest test of the season.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really, really good group and honestly right now collectively, I would have to say when you look at them on film they\u2019re probably the best offensive line that we have seen this year,\u201d Marrone said.\n\nWELCOME BACK\n\nJaguars running back Leonard Fournette is expected to return after missing six of the past seven games because of a strained right hamstring.\n\nHe practiced in full for the first time in more than a month Monday and did the same Wednesday. Marrone says the coaching staff won\u2019t limit Fournette\u2019s touches against the Colts.\n\n\u201cWe are full-boring everybody,\u201d Marrone said. \u201cOnce a guy is ready to play, that has to be our expectation.\u201d\n\nPAYING TRIBUTE\n\nAdam Vinatieri became the NFL\u2019s career scoring leader at Oakland.\n\nOn Sunday, the Colts will celebrate the record-breaking moment during a pregame ceremony at Lucas Oil Stadium. Details are being kept under wraps.\n\nNot surprisingly, the 45-year-old Vinatieri doesn\u2019t want to make too big a deal out of it.\n\n\u201cI want to keep it fairly low key,\u201d Vinatieri said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be a distraction. It\u2019s a fun accomplishment, it\u2019s a big accomplishment not only for me but for the guys I\u2019ve played with. But at the end of the day the only thing I want to get out of this weekend is a win.\u201d\n\nGOING BACK\n\nJaguars receiver Donte Moncrief, who spent the first four years of his career in Indianapolis, is looking forward to going back for the weekend.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a lot of emotions,\u201d Moncrief said. \u201cI\u2019ve still got to go out there and play and make plays like I\u2019ve been doing. Don\u2019t try to make it too big. Just go out there and do what you usually do.\u201d\n\nMoncrief has 29 receptions for 379 yards and two touchdowns this season. He signed a one-year, $9.6 million contract with the Jaguars in March, betting on himself to stay healthy and prove he\u2019s worthy of a more lucrative, long-term deal in the league.\n\nMR. 3,000\n\nWith seven passing attempts Sunday, Luck will hit No. 3,000.\n\nHe needs one TD pass to tie Eli Manning (156) for the 10th-highest total in league history over a player\u2019s first seven seasons and three to match Cam Newton (158) for No. 9.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "SHERIDAN, Wyo.

Infantino has asked the emir of Qatar to consider co-hosting the next World Cup with several nations that are attempting to isolate the tiny desert country in a bitter diplomatic dispute. Qatar has just eight stadiums to host 64 games over an already-congested 28-day window in 2022. Expanding the field to 48 teams would mean 80 games, requiring more stadiums.

Members of the caravan which has stopped in Mexico City demanded buses Thursday to take them to the U.S. border, saying it tis too cold and dangerous to continue walking and hitchhiking.(AP Photo/Rebecca Blackwell)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Trump administration said Thursday it will deny asylum to migrants who enter the country illegally, invoking extraordinary presidential national security powers to tighten the border as caravans of Central Americans slowly approach the United States.\n\nThe measures are meant to funnel asylum seekers through official border crossings for speedy rulings, officials said, instead of having them try to circumvent such crossings on the nearly 2,000-mile (3,200-kilometer) border. But the busy ports of entry already have long lines and waits, forcing immigration officials to tell some migrants to come back to make their claims.\n\nThe move was spurred in part by caravans of Central American migrants slowly moving north on foot, but will apply to anyone caught crossing illegally, officials said. It\u2019s unknown whether those in the caravan, many fleeing violence in their homeland, plan to cross illegally.\n\nThe regulations will be incorporated in a proclamation expected to be issued Friday by President Donald Trump. He will invoke the same powers he used to push through a version of the travel ban that was upheld by the Supreme Court, according to senior administration officials. The officials were not authorized to speak publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. The regulations would circumvent laws stating that anyone is eligible for asylum no matter how he or she enters the country,\n\nAdministration officials said those denied asylum under the proclamation may be eligible for similar forms of protection if they fear returning to their countries, though they would be subject to a tougher threshold. Those forms of protection include \u201cwithholding of removal\u201d \u2014 which is similar to asylum, but doesn\u2019t allow for green cards or bringing families \u2014 or asylum under the United Nations Convention Against Torture.\n\nThe announcement was the latest push to enforce Trump\u2019s hard-line stance on immigration through regulatory changes and presidential orders, bypassing Congress. But those efforts have been largely thwarted by legal challenges and, in the case of family separations this year, stymied by a global outcry that prompted Trump to scrap them.\n\nThe new changes were likely to be met with legal challenges, too. Omar Jadwat, director of the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project, said they were clearly illegal.\n\n\u201cU.S. law specifically allows individuals to apply for asylum whether or not they are at a port of entry. It is illegal to circumvent that by agency or presidential decree,\u201d he said.\n\nCurbing immigration has been a signature issue for Trump, who pushed it hard in the days leading up to Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections, railing against the caravans that are still hundreds of miles from the border.\n\nHe has made little mention of the issue since the election but has sent troops to the border in response. As of Thursday, there are more than 5,600 U.S. troops deployed to the border mission, with about 550 actually working on the border in Texas. The military is expected to have the vast majority of the more than 7,000 troops planned for the mission deployed by Monday, and that number could grow.\n\nTrump also suggested he\u2019d revoke the right to citizenship for babies born to non-U.S. citizens on American soil and erect massive \u201ctent cities\u201d to detain migrants. Those issues were not addressed by the regulations Thursday.\n\nThe administration has long said immigration officials are drowning in asylum cases partly because people falsely claim asylum and then live in the U.S. with work permits.\n\nThe asylum section of the Immigration and Nationality Act says a migrant is allowed to make a claim up to a year after arriving in the U.S., and it doesn\u2019t matter how they arrive \u2014 illegally or through a border crossing.\n\nMigrants who cross illegally are generally arrested and often seek asylum or some other form of protection. Claims have spiked in recent years, and there is a backlog of more than 800,000 cases pending in immigration court. Generally, only about 20 percent of applicants are approved.\n\nTrump has long said those seeking asylum should come through legal ports of entry. But many migrants are unaware of that guidance, and official border crossings have grown clogged.\n\nOfficials have turned away asylum seekers at border crossings because of overcrowding, telling them to return later. Backlogs have become especially bad in recent months at crossings in California, Arizona and Texas, with some people waiting five weeks to try to claim asylum at San Diego\u2019s main crossing.\n\nIn 2017, the U.S. fielded more than 330,000 asylum claims, nearly double the number two years earlier and surpassing Germany as highest in the world.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how many people en route to the U.S. will even make it to the border. About 4,800 migrants are sheltered in a sports complex in Mexico City, some 600 miles (965 kilometers) from the U.S. border. Several smaller groups were trailing hundreds of miles to the south; officials estimated about 7,000 in all were in the country in the caravans. The migrants are largely poor people and many say they\u2019re fleeing violence; more than 1,700 were children under 18, and more than 300 were children under age 5.\n\nSimilar caravans have gathered regularly over the years and have generally dwindled by the time they reach the southern border. Most have passed largely unnoticed.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Elliot Spagat in San Diego and Jill Colvin in Washington contributed to this report.", "Man who barricaded himself in Cottonwood home is found dead\n\nCOTTONWOOD, Ariz.

For the former, it\u2019s a warm hand of friendship in an otherwise unfamiliar environment; for the latter, it\u2019s a chance to broaden their boundaries as they extend their hospitality.\n\nIt\u2019s a win-win for everyone.\n\nAnd, indeed, it actually feels good, considering some of the aforementioned political rhetoric that dominated the news in the waning days of the midterm campaigns.\n\nMore than that, it\u2019s a good move for Mount Marty, which is gradually expanding its reach on a global scale. Earlier this semester, the school announced an arrangement with the University of Southern Bohemia in the Czech Republic that can see both students and faculty involved in exchange ventures. Also, the influx of foreign students opens up new pipelines of potential recruitment for the school in other countries. As such, MMC is starting to think in broader terms while it also works to cultivate stronger recruitment closer to home.\n\nThe program does indeed serve as a reminder that we can welcome the world, find connections and commonalities with those who are different from us, and see that we can be stronger together than apart.\n\nMMC\u2019s global outreach and welcome-family program help do just that.\n\n___\n\nAmerican News, Aberdeen, Nov. 8\n\nLovrien was the epitome of a public servant\n\nIn South Dakota we expect plenty from our public servants.\n\nWe expect them to be involved, intelligent and impartial.\n\nLarry Lovrien met each of those thresholds.

They typically only last 15 to 30 minutes and often cause flash freezing of road surfaces in addition to the whiteout conditions.\u201d\n\nNormally, only predictions of longer periods of snow or blizzards have been issued by the weather service.\n\nA warning of this type of weather event is particularly useful for those of us in the northern Plains. We drive longer distances between cities, and there are fewer highway lights that would help in visibility. We\u2019ve all been in white-out conditions when we can\u2019t see cars or objects in any direction, and we worry about a reckless driver coming up behind us.\n\nSnowfall rates can range between one to three inches per hour during in a snow squall. Visibility less than a quarter of a mile is also common within such winter storms.\n\nThe key use for us will be not to drive. A squall wouldn\u2019t pose any particular risk for homeowners, and it typically wouldn\u2019t cause ice buildup on power lines that might cause an outage.\n\nThe new warning went into effect at the start of the month after successful testing last winter. Warnings will be issued 10 to 20WateroW minutes ahead of an approaching squall.\n\nWe\u2019ll watch and see how many warnings are issued this winter. It will be hard to estimate how many accidents are avoided by such warnings, but we\u2019re eager to see if they are considered effective by winter\u2019s end.", "FILE - In this Nov. 4, 2018, file photo, Los Angeles Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers celebrates as he leaves the field after the team's NFL football game against the Seattle Seahawks in Seattle.

Warren, File)\n\nOAKLAND, Calif. (AP) \u2014 Derek Carr had appeared to pass Philip Rivers in the pecking order of AFC West quarterbacks two years ago. He put together a season worthy of MVP consideration while Rivers led the NFL in interceptions on the way to a last-place finish.\n\nCarr looked like one of the NFL\u2019s up-and-coming stars, while Rivers seemed to be on the downside of a career that started in 2004.\n\nThe script has flipped heading into Sunday\u2019s meeting between Rivers\u2019 Los Angeles Chargers (6-2) and Carr\u2019s Oakland Raiders (1-7). Rivers is playing as well as he has at any point in his 15-year career, while Carr is struggling to find his way in coach Jon Gruden\u2019s offense.\n\n\u201cObviously quarterbacks get way too much credit and way too much blame already, but I think we don\u2019t give enough credit to guys who have played that long,\u201d Carr said. \u201cI\u2019ll say it this way, the hardest part mentally going through a season is the days leading up to the game. Sunday is fun, man. You cut it loose and you give it everything you have. Having to recover, ice tub, wake up early to get treatment, the lift, to lift heavy when everything hurts, that\u2019s when those guys don\u2019t get enough credit.\n\n\u201cHere I am at five years, I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m good. I\u2019ll keep doing this and I\u2019m good. But, those guys that are in their 15th, 20th season, we don\u2019t give them enough credit to mentally be that strong. It\u2019s awesome.\u201d\n\nRivers has career highs in yards per attempt (9.1) and passer rating (116.5), and is on pace for a career-high 38 touchdown passes while leading the Chargers to five straight wins.\n\nThe Chargers have strengthened their offensive line, have a potent running threat in Melvin Gordon, have plenty of outside targets with Keenan Allen, Tyrell Williams and Mike Williams, and a strong defense.\n\nThat has all taken pressure off Rivers to carry too much of the load.\n\n\u201cThese last almost 20 games or so, we\u2019ve had good balance,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cLeaning on one another offensively and defensively taking care of the ball \u2014 all of those things are important. So we\u2019ve done a nice job of it so far.\u201d\n\nHere are some other things to watch:\n\nGORDON\u2019S RUN\n\nMelvin Gordon has rushed for 407 yards and scored five touchdowns in his last four games. He also has three 100-yard games in three of his past four, the first time that has happened in his career. The only game when Gordon did not go over the century mark was Week 5 against the Raiders; he had just 58 yards on 19 carries. The Raiders are last in the league in rushing defense, but Gordon knows he has a tough test ahead.\n\n\u201cThey played me pretty tough last time we went up against them. It is never easy since they are a rival. As a group the offensive line is hitting on all cylinders. We hope to keep getting stronger.\u201d\n\nPRESSURE POINT\n\nThe Raiders have struggled to generate any sort of pass pressure all season after trading away Khalil Mack. Oakland ranks last in the NFL with seven sacks and last with 35 QB pressures, according to SportRadar, 28 fewer pressures than the next-lowest team. Fixing that will only get harder after the team released top pass rusher Bruce Irvin last week. That puts more pressure on a trio of rookies \u2014 P.J. Hall, Arden Key and Maurice Hurst \u2014 that has three sacks this season.\n\n\u201cWe put a lot on their plate and that\u2019s because they\u2019re the future of this team,\u201d teammate Frostee Rucker said. \u201cThey have to come along and play.\u201d\n\nKINGS OF PICKS\n\nThe Chargers have seven interceptions during their five-game winning streak and have 189 yards in returns, which leads the league. Second-year cornerback Desmond King has three of the interceptions and returned one 42 yards for a touchdown last week at Seattle to put the Chargers up by two scores.\n\nMISSING WIDEOUTS\n\nOakland has struggled to get any production from wideouts in recent weeks. Since the start of Week 5, Oakland ranks last in the NFL with 37 catches and 428 yards receiving from wide receivers. Amari Cooper had one catch for 10 yards in two games in that span before being traded to Dallas. Seth Roberts leads Oakland\u2019s pass catchers with 12 receptions over those four games, while Martavis Bryant has the most yards with 138.\n\nNEW KICKER (AGAIN)\n\nThe Chargers have become the Bermuda Triangle for placekickers. Michael Badgley is the team\u2019s sixth since the start of last season and moved into the role fulltime this week after Caleb Sturgis was released on Monday. Badgley made all three of his field goals and seven extra points in the two games he kicked when Sturgis had a quadriceps injury.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Joe Reedy contributed to this report\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "WOODSTOCK, Ill.

After declaring the race for governor over, Republican Brian Kemp met with Gov. Nathan Deal on Thursday to start the work of transitioning his executive team. But Stacey Abrams is not conceding anything yet, hopeful that a trove of provisional ballots could be enough to swing the race into a runoff. Her campaign unveiled a litigation team poised to take the fight to the legal system, and says an additional 25,632 Abrams votes will push this race into runoff territory. (Bob Andres/Atlanta Journal-Constitution via AP)\n\nATLANTA (AP) \u2014 With Democrat Stacey Abrams insisting there are enough votes to keep her in Georgia\u2019s fiercely contested governor\u2019s race, a key focus will be an estimated 21,300 provisional ballots and whether those will help her make enough of a dent in Republican Brian Kemp\u2019s lead to trigger a December runoff.\n\nFederal law requires provisional ballots to be offered to voters whose eligibility cannot be immediately determined, but there is no guarantee that such a ballot will ultimately be counted.\n\nHere is a closer look at provisional ballots and how they work:\n\nWHAT ARE PROVISIONAL BALLOTS?\n\nProvisional ballots are similar to regular ballots, but they are kept separate and not counted unless the voter\u2019s eligibility is confirmed.\n\nThe process for issuing them and determining which ones are eligible is left to state and local election officials.\n\nIn Georgia, for instance, if a voter forgets a photo ID, he or she will receive a provisional ballot. In these cases, the voter must present their identification at their local election office within a few business days to have their vote count.\n\nIf a voter\u2019s name does not appear on the list of registered voters in a precinct, he or she will also receive a provisional ballot. Later, election officials will determine if that voter was eligible to vote but voted in the wrong precinct. In that case, only the votes in races he or she was eligible to vote in will be counted.\n\nFederal law requires election officials to provide a way for voters to check on their provisional ballot, typically by using a toll-free phone number or a website. If a provisional ballot was not counted, a reason should be provided.\n\n__\n\nHOW COMMON ARE THEY?\n\nDuring the 2016 presidential election, 16,739 provisional ballots were cast in Georgia, according to the U.S. Election Assistance Commission.\n\nThat means the 21,300 provisional ballots cast in this year\u2019s election is greater than 2016, when a slightly larger electorate in Georgia voted for president.\n\nNearly 60 percent of the 21,300 provisional ballots in this year\u2019s election were clustered in the state\u2019s most populous counties \u2014 Fulton, Gwinnett, Cobb, DeKalb, Chatham and Clayton. Those also happen to be counties with large numbers of Democratic voters, something Abrams is banking on.\n\nWhile DeKalb County saw a 160 percent jump in provisional ballots over 2016, Gwinnett County only saw a 3 percent increase. Abrams won 83.4 percent of the vote in DeKalb County compared to 56.5 percent in Gwinnett County.\n\nThe 21,300 provisional ballots alone wouldn\u2019t be enough for Abrams to erase Kemp\u2019s lead or to force a runoff. With all precincts reporting, Kemp holds a lead of 62,722 votes. Kemp has 50.3 percent of the votes so far, while Abrams has 48.7 percent.\n\nAbrams\u2019 campaign is convinced that provisional ballots combined with other ballots, such as absentee votes, haven\u2019t been counted and could trigger a recount or runoff. Kemp needs to stay above 50 percent to avoid a runoff.\n\n__\n\nWHY MIGHT THERE BE MORE PROVISIONAL BALLOTS THIS YEAR?\n\nIt\u2019s tough to say at this point. Voting rights experts say provisional ballots are an important tool to ensure that a voter is not disenfranchised due to an administrative error. They also create a paper trail for identifying potential areas of concern, such as overly aggressive efforts to remove eligible voters from the rolls.\n\nExperts caution against provisional ballots being overused because there is no guarantee they will be counted.\n\nIn Georgia, there have been lawsuits over efforts by Kemp\u2019s Secretary of State\u2019s Office to implement the state\u2019s \u201cexact-match\u201d law, which flagged some 53,000 voter registration applications this year. The law requires information on the forms to match certain state and federal records, with civil rights groups saying the policy disproportionately affects black, Latino and Asian-American applicants.\n\nKemp has said the concerns are overblown because those on the list can vote if they bring a valid photo ID that substantially matches the information on file, something already required under the state\u2019s voter ID law.\n\nBut if the election worker decides it doesn\u2019t, the voter could be directed to cast a provisional ballot.\n\n__\n\nARE PROVISIONAL BALLOTS ALWAYS COUNTED?\n\nNo. If a voter is determined to be ineligible, the provisional ballot is rejected and will not be counted.\n\nIn Georgia in 2016, 55 percent of provisional ballots were rejected. That means 9,147 people did not have their votes counted.\n\nNationally, of the 2.4 million provisional ballots cast in the 2016 presidential election, 25 percent were rejected. California had the most provisional ballots of any state, with 1.3 million cast and roughly 15 percent rejected.\n\nNationally, election officials reported the most common reason for rejecting a provisional ballot was a voter not being registered in the state. Other reasons included provisional ballots being cast in the wrong county or wrong precinct and problems with a voter\u2019s identification or signature.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press data journalist Meghan Hoyer contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow Christina Almeida Cassidy on Twitter at http://twitter.com/AP_Christina .", "HUNTINGTON, W.Va.

(AP Photo/Rick Scuteri, File)\n\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) \u2014 The Patrick Mahomes Reunion Tour rolls on Sunday when the young, record-setting quarterback leads the high-flying Kansas City Chiefs against the Arizona Cardinals at Arrowhead Stadium.\n\nLast week, Mahomes shredded the Cleveland Browns while outplaying their rookie quarterback, Baker Mayfield. The two met when Mahomes was being recruited to Texas Tech and Mayfield helped to serve as his host, and their relationship continued even when Mayfield transferred to Oklahoma.\n\nThis week, Mahomes gets to reminiscence about his time working at Peyton Manning\u2019s football camp with his old roommate, Josh Rosen \u2014 now the quarterback on whom the Cardinals are pinning their future.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve met him a couple times, been out to California and met him,\u201d Mahomes said. \u201cHe throws a beautiful ball. It\u2019s always a really tight spiral. I know he\u2019ll have a lot of success.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s going to be tough to top the success Mahomes is having.\n\nThe Chiefs\u2019 first-year starter is setting benchmarks just about every time he steps on the field, and the next one might be consecutive 300-yard passing games. Mahomes has eight straight to match Andrew Luck from the 2014 season, and he\u2019s shown no signs of slowing down.\n\n\u201cI thought he was pretty good,\u201d Rosen said, reflecting on those days working camp together. \u201cWe weren\u2019t really throwing, we were mostly just coaching the kids. So we didn\u2019t get to really throw too much, but I liked him as a dude. We got along really well.\u201d\n\nRosen hasn\u2019t seen a whole lot of Mahomes with the Chiefs (8-1) this week, either, because he\u2019s spent all his time focusing on the defense. But Cardinals coach Steve Wilks has seen enough to know that stopping him may be impossible, and slowing him down is nearly as difficult.\n\nThat goes for the entirety of the Kansas City offense.\n\n\u201cOne thing we talked about all week is really trying to limit those big plays, understanding exactly who they\u2019re trying to target,\u201d Wilks said. \u201cThis is a very explosive offense. Going against Andy Reid for several years in different places, going all the way back to the Eagles, this is part of his M.O. So, we\u2019ve got to try to limit the big plays as much as possible.\u201d\n\nThe Cardinals (2-6) have struggled much of the season, particularly on offense. But they\u2019re coming off an uplifting, fourth-quarter comeback victory over San Francisco that was capped by Rosen\u2019s touchdown strike to Christian Kirk in the final minute.\n\n\u201cYou can let point spreads and all these things \u2014 \u2018trap game\u2019 \u2014 and all these terms that pop up and things that happen come into it,\u201d Reid said of perhaps the biggest challenge facing the Chiefs this week. \u201cBut if you can honestly focus on the process and discipline yourself to do that, that normally takes care of things. ... You\u2019re not going to let distractions get in the way.\u201d\n\nAs the Chiefs and Cardinals prepare to meet Sunday, here are some interesting notes:\n\nGETTING HEALTHIER\n\nChiefs safety Daniel Sorensen is expected to play after returning from injured reserve, where he\u2019d been since breaking his leg in training camp. The Chiefs also could have top pass rusher Justin Houston back from a hamstring injury that has sidelined him the past four games.\n\nROSEN AND REID\n\nRosen\u2019s father, noted physician Dr. Charles Rosen, graduated from the University of Pennsylvania, and the youngster was an avid fan of Reid and the Philadelphia Eagles growing up.\n\n\u201cI used to have an Eagles shirt when I was a kid that said, \u2018Our coach will eat yours.\u2019 I was a huge Andy Reid fan,\u201d Rosen said. \u201cHim and Mike Vick and the DeSean Jackson days were very fun to watch.\n\nFITZGERALD\u2019S NUMBERS\n\nCardinals wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald has been climbing into the upper reaches of the NFL\u2019s career receiving marks, and he is closing in on a couple very high rungs.\n\nFitzgerald has 15,902 yards receiving, and he needs 33 more to pass Terrell Owens for second place behind Jerry Rice on the career list. Fitzgerald also needs 58 catches to pass former Chiefs tight end Tony Gonzalez for second behind Rice in career receptions.\n\nFitzgerald had eight catches for 102 yards and a TD in last week\u2019s 18-15 win over San Francisco.\n\nPERFECTION, ALMOST\n\nReid was asked this week how often his creative plays are executed properly \u2014 when all 11 guys do exactly what they are supposed to do. And his answer was quite candid.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d probably give you 85 percent of the time,\u201d Reid said. \u201cNow, they can get beat and that would bring it down a little bit, but mostly guys will attempt to do the right thing. It amazes me how they can digest all this and in a split-second know \u2014 there\u2019s 200 plays on that sheet, and you have to figure it out like that, and these guys do it.\u201d\n\nMAKE WAY, LEN\n\nMahomes already has thrown 29 touchdown passes, which means he needs just two more to pass Len Dawson\u2019s franchise record. The Hall of Famer set one of the Chiefs\u2019 longest-standing records in 1964, an era in which passing generally took a back seat to running the ball.\n\n\u201cIt would be awesome,\u201d Mahomes said, \u201cbecause Len had a lot of success in the NFL and was kind of ahead of his time, throwing all those touchdowns. It would be awesome to pass that.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "MONTREAL (AP) \u2014 Canadian plane and train maker Bombardier Inc. said Thursday it will shed 5,000 jobs and sell off two units as part of a five-year plan to rein in costs, focus on rail and business jets, and reduce debt.\n\nAbout 2,500 Bombardier workers will be laid off in Quebec and 500 in Ontario while about 2,000 cuts will be overseas.\n\nThe Montreal-based company said will sell its Q400 turboprop aircraft program to a subsidiary of Longview Aviation Capital Corp. for about US$300 million.

(AP Photo/Efrem Lukatsky, File)\n\nIn Oleksandr Usyk, boxing has a rising, unbeaten star ready to further shake up a revitalized heavyweight division.\n\nThe Ukrainian fighter just has one last job to finish off at cruiserweight level.\n\nUsyk makes the first defense of his four cruiserweight titles when he takes on Tony Bellew in Manchester on Saturday. It will be Usyk\u2019s 16th professional fight, and likely his last in a division he unified in July.\n\nThe 31-year-old Usyk is planning to make the step up to heavyweight \u2014 the division in which he won Olympic gold at the 2012 London Games \u2014 and there\u2019s already talk of a fight against Anthony Joshua, the IBF, WBO and WBA titleholder.\n\nThis all sounds familiar to Bellew.\n\nLast year, Bellew climbed up from cruiserweight to heavyweight to fight David Haye, another boxer who intended to use Bellew as a way to get a lucrative fight with Joshua.\n\nBellew upset the odds by knocking out Haye in the 11th round and then, in a rematch in May, stopped the former heavyweight champion in the fifth round.\n\nThe 35-year-old Liverpool native has already been world cruiserweight champion and has a 30-2-1 record. The fight against Usyk is set to be his last before retirement.\n\n\u201cOne more night to survive through,\u201d Bellew said, \u201cand then I go on to live the dream life with my family.\u201d\n\nIt could be the biggest night of his boxing career \u2014 and possibly the toughest.\n\nUsyk, a southpaw, has risen virtually untouched through the professional ranks since leaving his amateur days behind him after the London Olympics. Eleven of his 15 wins have come inside the distance. As an amateur, he was also a world and European champion.\n\n\u201cThe only chance I have is a puncher\u2019s chance \u2014 I cannot outbox this man,\u201d Bellew said. \u201cHe is a formidable opponent. He has everything any boxer could possibly want and he is a horrible southpaw.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019ve shown what I can do at heavyweight and, believe you me, I will show even more what I can do at cruiserweight. I am faster, sharper and possibly even stronger at cruiserweight. As good as he is, as great as he is, he is meeting someone with something inside him.\u201d\n\nGiven Bellew\u2019s improved standing in recent years and the fact the fight is being held in Britain, Usyk\u2019s profile is set to be bigger than ever if he wins.\n\n\u201cTony is my best opponent ever, definitely,\u201d he said Thursday.\n\nUsyk was born in Crimea and has said he was forced to leave the peninsula after Russia annexed it from Ukraine in 2014.\n\nHe became undisputed cruiserweight champion after fighting three times in 10 months in the World Boxing Super Series, in which he beat Marco Huck, the then-WBC champion Mairis Briedis, and most recently Murat Gassiev in July.\n\nWhat stood out, in particular, during those wins was his remarkable footwork and movement that the aging Bellew could struggle with.\n\nComparing the two fighters, Bellew \u2014 the underdog \u2014 appears to have one major advantage: Experience.\n\nAnd potentially another.\n\n\u201cTony\u2019s left hook is the equalizer,\u201d the now-retired Haye said in the build-up. \u201cIf Tony can land that left hook to the head, that left hook to the body, he can really get a foothold in this fight and turn the tide.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nSteve Douglas is at www.twitter.com/sdouglas80", "Pittsburgh Police Officer Mike Smidga, Pittsburgh Police Chief Scott Schubert and Officer Anthony Burke take part in a ceremonial puck drop with Pittsburgh Penguins center Sidney Crosby (87) and New York Islanders left wing Anders Lee (27) before an NHL hockey game in Pittsburgh, Tuesday, Oct. 30, 2018.

(AP) \u2014 Andrew Whitworth and most of his Los Angeles Rams teammates live within a few miles of their team\u2019s training complex in Thousand Oaks.

Whitworth addressed the players and began the process of coming up with a way to honor the victims.\n\nThe team will hold a moment of silence before its home game against Seattle on Sunday, and the Rams may organize additional tributes to the victims, McVay said.\n\n\u201cIt was very heartfelt throughout the entire team,\u201d offensive guard Rodger Saffold said. \u201cWe work here, and we spend most of our time out here. When we heard about it, it was very shocking. ... It just hurt a lot. There\u2019s way too many mass shootings, and this one hit really close to home.\u201d\n\nPhillips described the shooting as a \u201chorrible tragedy.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a sad, sad deal, and we feel for the people it happened to,\u201d Phillips added. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t just affect those people.

Recent graduate Justin Meek was killed, according to the school.\n\nClasses were canceled at CLU on Thursday.\n\nQuarterback Jared Goff , punter Johnny Hekker , receiver Cooper Kupp and others tweeted about the tragedy before practice. After McVay and Whitworth spoke to the team, Saffold said the players discussed putting together a relief fund or other mechanisms of help for the victims.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that makes you step back and gives you a perspective,\u201d McVay said. \u201cI know me personally, I\u2019m very guilty of losing perspective, because you\u2019re just in your own little world and it\u2019s all football, all the time, and then you have things like this that occur and re-gather your priorities and your perspective on what\u2019s really important, and (serve as a reminder to) not to get bent out of shape on some of the things that maybe I tend to do, just being in the role that I\u2019m in.\u201d\n\nAlthough the Rams are playing their games downtown in the Coliseum before their new stadium opens in Inglewood in 2020, the team chose the western Los Angeles suburbs for its semi-permanent weekday home when it returned to Southern California from St. Louis in 2016.\n\nThe Rams\u2019 separate corporate offices also are in nearby Agoura Hills, a short drive from Thousand Oaks. Most of the team\u2019s employees also live in the suburban Ventura County suburbs one hour northwest of downtown Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cTo wake up to something like that, it was just sad to hear it,\u201d cornerback Marcus Peters said. \u201cWe talked about it as a team, because it\u2019s right down the street from us.

(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A federal appeals court heard arguments Thursday about whether special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s appointment to lead the Russia investigation was constitutional.\n\nThe case was brought by Andrew Miller, a former aide to longtime Trump confidant Roger Stone, because he doesn\u2019t want to testify before a grand jury as part of the investigation into whether the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia in 2016.\n\nAt issue is whether Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein had the authority to appoint Mueller. The special counsel\u2019s office says yes. But lawyers for Miller say no.\n\nThe three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia is now weighing that question but the latest shake up at the Justice Department hangs over the case.\n\nOn Wednesday, President Donald Trump appointed a Mueller critic, Matthew Whitaker, as acting Attorney General, putting him in place to oversee the Russia probe instead of Rosenstein. On Thursday, Judge Karen Henderson told attorneys for Mueller and for Miller to argue the case as if \u201cthe events of yesterday didn\u2019t happen\u201d but noted that the judges may want the parties to file additional briefs in response to Trump\u2019s move.\n\nThe court fight comes as Mueller\u2019s team is scrutinizing Stone\u2019s connection to WikiLeaks. American intelligence agencies have concluded that Russian agents were the source of damaging information on Hillary Clinton that WikiLeaks released during the 2016 campaign. Mueller\u2019s team has been probing whether Stone had any advance knowledge of WikiLeaks plans, a contention he has denied.\n\nFour separate federal judges have upheld Mueller\u2019s appointment but Miller\u2019s case is the first to reach oral arguments at the appellate level. And his attorney, Paul Kamenar, says that regardless of the panel\u2019s decision, the case is bound to be decided by the Supreme Court.\n\nDuring oral arguments before Henderson, Judge Sri Srinivasan and Judge Judith Rogers, Kamenar cast the special counsel as an unchecked prosecutorial power.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s like a U.S. Attorney-at-large,\u201d he told the judges. Kamenar argued that Congress hasn\u2019t passed a law specifically authorizing the appointment of a private attorney as a special counsel. And even if the legal authority existed, only Sessions could have appointed Mueller and not Rosenstein, who issued the order after Sessions recused himself from oversight of the Russia investigation, Kamenar said.\n\nBut special counsel attorney Michael Dreeben rejected Kamenar\u2019s arguments, saying Rosenstein has closely supervised the probe.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the case that the special counsel is out wandering in a free-floating environment,\u201d Dreeben said. He argued that there was ample case law and statutory authority for Mueller\u2019s appointment, noting that special counsels have been used for decades to ensure the American people that an investigation can be carried out independently, especially in cases involving the president.\n\nThe case of Miller, the former aide to Stone, is backed by the right-leaning nonprofit group, National Legal and Policy Center, which hopes to use the case as a vehicle to invalidate every action Mueller has taken to date. That would include the six guilty pleas, one trial conviction and multiple pending indictments including one against a Russian company accused of taking part in a vast social media effort to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. That company, Concord Management and Consulting, joined Miller\u2019s case as an amicus.\n\nKamenar told reporters Thursday that he doesn\u2019t know the details of the special counsel\u2019s interest in Stone or whether Miller is a key witness. He said he expects a ruling in later November but it could come sooner since it involves an active grand jury investigation.\n\n___\n\nFollow Chad Day on Twitter: https://twitter.com/ChadSDay", "MONTGOMERY, Ala.

It allows drivers to use video cameras, dash cameras and other recording devices for security purposes \u2014 but not to broadcast them.\n\n\u201cBroadcasting a person\u2019s image, audio, or video recording is a violation of these terms and may result in loss of account access,\u201d the guideline states.\n\nUber said the guideline was in place when a Phoenix driver posted video from Oct. 29 of Ottawa Senators players insulting the team and an assistant coach. The players apologized to their coach and said in a statement that their \u201cprivate conversation was recorded without our knowledge or consent.\u201d\n\nUber said the driver\u2019s access was removed.\n\nIn July, both Uber and its rival, Lyft, cut ties with driver Jason Gargac , who recorded about 700 St. Louis-area passengers without their permission and most were streamed to his channel on the live video website Twitch. Passengers who were unwittingly recorded and broadcast included children, intoxicated college students and public figures, including Alice in Chains lead guitarist Jerry Cantrell, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported.\n\nThe newspaper said the posted videos sometimes included names and showed passengers vomiting, kissing, and trash-talking relatives, friends and employers.

The bridge authority would assume ownership after completion and lease the tunnel back to Enbridge for 99 years.\n\nIt would replace an underwater segment of Enbridge\u2019s Line 5, which carries about 23 million gallons of oil and natural gas liquids daily. Environmentalists are pushing to decommission the twin lines, which have been in place since 1953, while the company says they\u2019re in good condition.\n\nA crucial part of Snyder\u2019s plan is putting the bridge authority in charge of the tunnel, even though the authority\u2019s only responsibility since its founding has been managing the 5-mile-long bridge linking Michigan\u2019s Upper and Lower Peninsulas.\n\nMichael Mooney, a Colorado School of Mines expert on tunnel design and consultant for the state, said the tunnel proposal is sound and would provide extra protection by encasing the new pipeline in concrete.\n\n\u201cThere is virtually no way for product to leak out of this tunnel,\u201d Mooney said.\n\nThe seven-member bridge authority, which has four members recently appointed by Snyder, is scheduled to meet again in February.

(AP Photo/Jack Dempsey, File)\n\nDENVER (AP) \u2014 Vance Joseph keeps losing games but not his locker room.\n\nThat\u2019s why Denver Broncos general manager John Elway didn\u2019t fire his coach at the bye like so many fans were suggesting.\n\nDespite Joseph\u2019s 8-17 mark in Denver and a 3-6 start for the second straight season, Elway is encouraged by the growth he sees in the coach he contemplated firing last year and in the fight he sees in his scrappy team this year.\n\n\u201cAt this point in time, we\u2019re going to stay the course. I think there\u2019s enough good things that are going on ... and the way that we\u2019re playing,\u201d Elway told Broncos broadcasting partner 760-AM in Denver. \u201cI\u2019m much more encouraged this year than I was last year.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, the Broncos lost eight games by double digits on their way to a 5-11 mark.\n\nAlthough they\u2019re flirting with back-to-back losing seasons for the first time in 46 years, the Broncos have gone toe to toe with some of the league\u2019s heavyweights.\n\nThey\u2019ve lost by a combined dozen points to the Chiefs (8-1) twice, the Rams (8-1) and the Texans (6-3).\n\nElway hit the motherlode in 2018 by drafting Bradley Chubb, Courtland Sutton, Royce Freeman and Josey Jewell and signing undrafted free agent Phillip Lindsay.\n\nThese baffling Broncos, though, lack depth at key positions because of his deficient drafts in recent years that include first-rounders Bradley Roby, Shane Ray, Paxton Lynch and Garett Bolles.\n\nWith the immediate impact of so many rookies and the strong, steady play of veterans Von Miller , Chris Harris Jr. , and Emmanuel Sanders , the Broncos have enough star power to compete with the league\u2019s top teams.\n\nThey also have a razor-thin margin for error as they\u2019re repeatedly encumbered by bad play-calling, penalties and poor performances, especially by Bolles at left tackle and Roby at cornerback.\n\nBolles\u2019 NFL-high 17 holding calls in his 1\u00bd seasons has earned him the nickname \u201cGarett Holds\u201d on Denver\u2019s airwaves.\n\nAfter excelling as a nickel back for years, Roby\u2019s promotion to starter in a contract year following Aqib Talib\u2019s trade to the Rams has been a perplexing failure.\n\nYet, Joseph has had to let both Bolles and Roby fix their flaws in the glare of games because of a lack of depth at their positions. Last month, Joseph told The Associated Press he didn\u2019t fear losing his players over sticking with Bolles and Roby: \u201cThey understand we\u2019re playing the best players.\u201d\n\nDespite their holes, the Broncos could be 6-3 and surrounded by an entirely different narrative were it not for three slip-ups, all at home:\n\n\u2014They lost 27-23 to the Chiefs when offensive coordinator Bill Musgrave inexplicably went to three-wide sets on a crucial fourth-quarter three-and-out, giving the ball back right away to Patrick Mahomes for what turned into the game-winning drive. With Denver\u2019s defense exhausted \u2014 Harris was taken off for IVs \u2014 what was needed instead was for the Broncos to run both the football and time off the clock.\n\n\u2014They lost 23-20 to the Rams when Sanders\u2019 taunting foul resulted in a field goal instead of a touchdown, a four-point swing that proved to be the difference.\n\n\u2014They lost 19-17 to the Texans when Brandon McManus missed a 51-yard field goal as time expired after Joseph decided he was close enough after reaching the Houston 32 with 38 seconds left. The Broncos ran down the clock to 13 seconds before snapping it again and Lindsay lost a yard.\n\nMcManus, who missed a 62-yarder in the closing seconds of the first half, allowing the Texans to go down and kick a field goal for a six-point swing, had never missed consecutive kicks as a pro but was again wide right.\n\nJoseph accepted the blame for the 62-yarder, saying he got greedy because of Denver\u2019s offensive struggles.\n\n\u201cPut that on me,\u201d Joseph said. \u201cI was chasing points. That\u2019s wrong.\u201d\n\nJoseph, however, staunchly defended his decision-making on the second one when he decided not to risk Case Keenum getting sacked again after the Broncos got inside the Houston 35-yard line.\n\nHowever, McManus is much more accurate from inside of 50 yards than outside. He\u2019s successful 77 percent of the time between 40 and 49 yards, but just 52 percent of the time on field goals of 50 yards and longer.\n\nSo, Joseph basically settled for a coin flip and paid the price with his 17th loss in 25 games as Broncos coach, leading furious fans to call for his ouster as they filed out of Mile High Stadium on Sunday night.\n\nNot so fast, said Elway.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d love to have the magic wand and throw the fairy dust on this thing and have some good things happen and get us over the hump,\u201d Elway said on 760-AM. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in six one-score games, so I\u2019m much more encouraged this year than I was last year because I think that guys are still playing hard and we\u2019re in games.\u201d\n\nAlthough the Broncos have the 49ers, Browns and Raiders left to play, they also face the Chargers (6-2) twice, the Steelers (5-2-1) and the Bengals (5-3).\n\nJoseph said the Broncos need to start and finish better and somehow \u201cfind six more points a game.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe do that,\u201d Joseph said, \u201cwe can win a lot of games.\u201d\n\nAnd maybe save his job again come January.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\n___\n\nFollow Arnie Melendrez Stapleton on Twitter: http://twitter.com/arniestapleton", "Democratic gubernatorial challenger Christine Hallquist addresses supporters as she delivers her concession speech during an election night rally party in Burlington, Vt., Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2018.

(AP Photo/Desmond Boylan)\n\nHAVANA (AP) \u2014 Representatives from the United States\u2019 agricultural sector arrived in Cuba on Thursday for a conference aimed at promoting sales, one of the few U.S. business areas allowed to deal with the island under a half-century-old trade embargo that Cuban leaders blame for most of its economic troubles.\n\nThe U.S.-Cuba Agriculture Coalition will explore potential opportunities for American agriculture producers seeking a market on the island. Cuba imports most of its food products from abroad, a multibillion-dollar market that has flourished despite U.S. sanctions.\n\nRelations between both countries normalized somewhat after former U.S. President Barack Obama loosened the trade embargo while in office. But President Donald Trump has intensified sanctions, making it harder for Americans to travel to Cuba and conduct business.\n\nIn 2017, the United States sold $260 million of food to the Cuba, but the figure was one of the lowest in this decade and paled in comparison to the $450 million of U.S. food sold in 2012.\n\nThe island still cannot sell its own products in the U.S. and is not given credit to help pay for imports as a result of the embargo.\n\nCuba spends about $2 billion a year to import food for its 11 million citizens, who are given almost free rations each month of products such as chicken, rice and milk.\n\nPhil Peters, a trip organizer, said U.S. agribusiness is interested in exporting more products to Cuba and improving regulatory conditions, and in \u201cbuilding a broader and more normal relationship in which there is investment and shared business.\u201d\n\nAbout 30 participants were meeting with officials at the conference and visiting farms and cooperatives in the Caribbean nation. The group is scheduled to stay until Saturday.\n\n\u201cOur country finds itself fully updating its economic model,\u201d Cuban deputy agriculture minister Jose Miguel Rodriguez de Armas said at the opening of the conference. \u201cThe concerns of the agriculture sector are very important for the development of our country.\u201d", "MOBILE, Ala. (AP) \u2014 There won\u2019t be an oyster season on the Alabama coast in the coming year, an unusual move caused by what officials say is a lack of oysters in state waters.\n\nAl.com reported Thursday that an official with the state conservation agency announced the decision during a meeting with seafood harvesters and dealers in southern Mobile County.\n\nOyster seasons have been closed in past years because of disasters including hurricanes or the BP oil spill in 2010, and the number of oyster boats working the area has been in decline. But Scott Bannon, director of the Marine Resources Division, said this year marked the first time there won\u2019t be a season because of a lack of oysters.\n\nA weeklong season last year produced only 136 sacks of oysters, down from 7,000 sacks in 2013, he said.\n\nThe move means wild oysters won\u2019t be harvested from state waters until at least the fall of 2019. The decision doesn\u2019t affect oyster-farming operations.\n\nConservation officials make exploratory dives to determine how many young oysters are present on reefs, and a check this year showed only 112 3-inch oysters per acre in Heron Bay, less than half the number from 2017.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what has caused a decline. Jason Herrmann, a Marine Resources biologist, said 2017 brought extended periods of low oxygen and low salinity in coastal waters, making last year disastrous for young oysters called spat. A spat wipeout in one year means few growing oysters in the next.\n\nAmong oyster harvesters, theories vary about what has caused the decline. Some point at development along the rivers that feed Mobile Bay, some at agricultural runoff, some at the disposal of dredge material from work to deepen Mobile\u2019s ship channel.\n\n\u201cTo me it\u2019s a culmination of a lot of things that happened,\u201d said Mayor Terry Downey of Bayou La Batre, a seafood processing hub.\n\nTed Gillespie, 60, has been harvesting oysters since he was 20. He said he will have to do something else since there won\u2019t be an oyster season this year.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to have to figure out some kind of fish to catch this winter,\u201d he said.", "CHARLESTON, S.C.

(AP) \u2014 Evan Engram understands that he has all the tools to be a top tight end in the NFL.\n\nThe New York Giants\u2019 second-year player, the team\u2019s first-round selection in 2017, has the size, speed and the drive to be a star.\n\nThere\u2019s only one problem. Engram has a propensity of dropping passes, especially in clutch situations.\n\nEngram caught 64 passes for 722 yards and six touchdowns last season. Engram also dropped 11 passes and vowed in the offseason to work on rectifying that problem.\n\nNow, in his second season, Engram has caught 17 passes for 145 yards and two touchdowns, but he has also dropped three passes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty tough,\u201d Engram said Thursday before the team practiced in preparation for facing the San Francisco 49ers on Monday night.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not where I want to be. I have to put some of these plays behind me and keep working on getting better and staying positive.\u201d\n\nEngram\u2019s problems are also magnified because the Giants have a 1-7 record for the second straight season.\n\n\u201cWe just have to go out and get a win,\u201d Engram said. \u201cWe have to get some of the bad tastes out of our mouths. It\u2019s going to feel good to get out there on the big stage Monday night.\u201d\n\nThe Giants are coming off their bye week, which should make the beleaguered team feel a little better.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important to put the bad things behind me,\u201d Engram said. \u201cA couple of those drops are catches that I can make in my sleep. I just want to go out there and give us enough an opportunity to win the game Monday night.\u201d\n\nEngram was the first rookie tight end to lead the Giants in receptions. His six touchdown catches were a franchise record for a rookie tight end in 2017.\n\nSo the potential is there. He just has to make sure to hold on to the ball, something that coach Pat Shurmur also realizes.\n\n\u201cEvan is a pass-catching tight end,\u201d Shurmur said. \u201cI think we all realize that. But it\u2019s important that he catches the ball. He\u2019s had a couple of drops. But he works at it. He has worked all along at catching the ball. He does a lot of drills, a lot of extra work. He works hard at catching the ball. He always puts the drop behind him and continues to work hard at trying to catch the ball.\u201d\n\nQuarterback Eli Manning recognizes Engram\u2019s passion for improving.\n\n\u201cEvan works hard and wants to do everything right,\u201d said Manning, who will remain the team\u2019s starter for the time being. \u201cHe puts in a lot of work. He\u2019s too good of a player and an athlete to let the little things bother him.\u201d\n\nManning knows that the Giants have had their difficulties scoring touchdowns this season.\n\n\u201cI feel like we\u2019re moving the ball well,\u201d Manning said. \u201cWe\u2019re getting yards and moving the ball down the field. We just need that to translate into scoring touchdowns. It always comes down to execution. We have to avoid the negative plays. We just have to execute better in the red zone.\u201d\n\nManning did not want to talk about whether Monday night\u2019s game against the Niners might be his last as a starter this season.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m worried about this week,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a job to do right now. We\u2019re just going to try to go out there and get the win this time. Sure, there\u2019s a sense of urgency. We all need to get going. We need to improve. We need to score some points. I feel like we\u2019re close. We just have to get back on track, keep improving and play some football.\u201d\n\nThe improvement might have to begin with the second-year tight end.\n\n\u201cI watch film of other tight ends,\u201d Engram said. \u201cThere are a lot of athletic tight ends in the league, so I try to pick up plays that can make me more effective. I love watching (Kansas City TE) Travis Kelce. He\u2019s so polished and smooth as a tight end. It\u2019s fun watching him. I always try to steal things from him.\u201d\n\nSo Engram took the practice field Thursday with the idea that the dropped passes, 14 over his first 1\u00bd seasons, are a thing of the past.\n\n\u201cI think we all strive for perfection,\u201d Engram said. \u201cI just have to put it (the dropped passes) behind me. I understand that it\u2019s part of the game and it\u2019s something that makes you work harder.\u201d\n\nNOTES: Shurmur continued to hint that newly acquired OG Jamon Brown might start Monday night, just a week after being claimed on waivers from the Los Angeles Rams. \u201cWe\u2019re putting him in there and getting him ready like he\u2019s going to start,\u201d Shurmur said of Brown. \u201cHe\u2019s a big man, a really big man (6-foot-4 and 340 pounds). He was a starter on a team that won more than 10 games last year. He\u2019s a really fast learner.\u201d ... Standout safety Landon Collins did not want to comment on a report that said the Giants were either going to place the franchise tag on him for next season or work on a long-term contract. \u201cThere has been no talk about that,\u201d Collins said. \u201cWhen we get to that, we get to that. If something happens, I\u2019ll let you know.\u201d ... Manning said that he spoke with QB Kyle Lauletta about his arrest last week for motor vehicle violations in Weehawken, N.J. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough situation for him,\u201d Manning said. \u201cI\u2019m trying to support him.

It also argues the provision creates an undue burden to abortion access.\n\nIf the ban takes effect Jan. 1 as scheduled, doctors would have to be physically present when a woman takes medication to end her pregnancy, the group contends.\n\nThe Center for Reproductive Rights filed its lawsuit on behalf of Trust Women Wichita, which has operated a clinic offering reproductive health care, including abortions, since 2013.\n\n\u201cThis ban hurts Kansas women by mandating that they must travel farther and pay more in gas, child care, lost wages and lodging to access necessary medical care,\u201d Julie Burkhart, chief executive officer of Trust Women, said in a news release. \u201cMedication abortion is safe whether provided in-person or by telemedicine.\u201d\n\nThe Kansas attorney general\u2019s office, which represents the state in lawsuits, did not immediately respond to phone and email messages seeking comment.\n\nThe complaint filed in Shawnee County District Court argues that 97 percent of Kansas counties in 2014 were without a single clinic that provides abortions, and more than half of Kansas women live in those counties. The five clinics in Kansas that offer abortion services are all in Wichita or suburban Kansas City.\n\nTrust Women recently began providing medication abortion via telemedicine to expand access to the clinic\u2019s services, according to the lawsuit. Before Trust Women introduced telemedicine, the clinic was able to provide abortion care two days a week because its physicians had to travel to Wichita. Telemedicine allowed it to offer the service on additional weekdays and Saturdays.\n\nThe Kansas Telemedicine Act requires insurances companies in Kansas to cover health care services provided through telemedicine if insurance already covers the services during personal visits to a doctor. The law aims to improve access to health care in underserved communities and rural areas.\n\nAbortion opponents insisted the telemedicine bill include language forbidding abortion by telemedicine.

Two struggling AFC East rivals with uncertain quarterback situations square off when the Buffalo Bills and New York Jets meet on Sunday. (AP Photo/Phelan M. Ebenhack, File)\n\nEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) \u2014 Even the most die-hard of Bills and Jets fans might have a tough time getting fired up about this one.\n\nStruggling offenses, quarterback questions and losing streaks are the ugly story lines marking the latest matchup of AFC East rivals, the first of their two meetings this season.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the NFL and anybody can be beat in this league,\u201d Jets safety Jamal Adams said. \u201cYou\u2019ve definitely got to show up each and every Sunday. It doesn\u2019t matter what the numbers are.\u201d\n\nWell, they aren\u2019t very good \u2014 for either side \u2014 when it comes to offense.\n\nThe Bills (2-7) have the 31st-ranked overall unit and have been dealing with a quarterback carousel all season, and were trying to figure out late in the week where it would stop this time.\n\nRookie Josh Allen has missed three games with a sprained right throwing elbow , veteran Derek Anderson was in concussion protocol, and turnover-prone Nathan Peterman has been healthy but ineffective, to put it mildly. He completed a career-high 31 passes last week against Chicago, but also had three interceptions in the 41-9 rout by the Bears.\n\nIt has been a problem all season no matter who has been under center for the Bills, who have lost four straight. They have scored two touchdowns in their last four games, and been outscored 103-20 in its last three.\n\n\u201cWell, you know, the result, obviously, is not what we want it to be on the offensive side,\u201d coach Sean McDermott said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to continue to find ways to create things, to create separation, to create wins in the 1-on-1 game, whether it\u2019s the run game or the pass game. You always look at yourself first. I expect myself and our coaches to look at ourselves first, and I expect the players to look at themselves first.\n\n\u201cCollectively, though, we have to do a better job.\u201d\n\nThe Jets (3-6) know the feeling.\n\nTodd Bowles\u2019 bunch has echoed those sentiments during the team\u2019s second three-game skid of the season.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re kind of realizing that it\u2019s a time to come closer together as a team, as a family and as a brotherhood,\u201d defensive lineman Leonard Williams said. \u201cWhen times are starting to get hard, that\u2019s when we\u2019ve got to face adversity arm in arm and face it as a team.\u201d\n\nIt appears they\u2019ll have to do it without rookie Sam Darnold, who is dealing with a foot strain that could sideline him a few weeks. Darnold leads the league with 14 interceptions, so 39-year-old Josh McCown might be what the Jets need to get things back on track for the league\u2019s 29th-ranked offense.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll go out and expect to play to my standard and to the standard of this football team,\u201d McCown said, \u201cand win a football game.\u201d\n\nHere are other things to know about the Bills-Jets matchup at MetLife Stadium:\n\nTHE REAL McCOY?\n\nBills running back LeSean McCoy is off to the worst start of his career with just 267 yards rushing and has yet to score.\n\nHe had 10 yards on 10 carries against the Bears, and hasn\u2019t been anything close to the dynamic player he has been throughout his career. McCoy was mentioned as a possible piece in a trade leading up to last week\u2019s deadline, but remains with Buffalo.\n\nOH, SNAP!\n\nThe struggles of Jets center Spencer Long have epitomized the New York\u2019s problems on offense.\n\nLong has been trying to play through an injured right middle finger on his snapping hand, and things really came to a head last week when he had several wayward snaps out of the shotgun. Bowles finally pulled him for Jonotthan Harrison late in the game, and Long could find himself on the sideline again this week.\n\nFAMILIAR FACE\n\nThe Bills were so desperate for receiver help they thrust Terrelle Pryor on the field five days after signing him. That came two weeks after the Jets cut him with an injury settlement because of an ailing groin.\n\nNew York thought he\u2019d be sidelined a while, but Pryor was back on the field last Sunday and had two catches for 19 yards. He\u2019ll have a chance to show the Jets how healthy he is Sunday.\n\nELI RETURNS\n\nSecond-year running back Elijah McGuire had 30 yards on seven carries and three catches for 37 yards for the Jets in his season debut after spending the first eight games on injured reserve with a broken foot.\n\nMcGuire has stepped into the dual-threat role usually held Bilal Powell, who\u2019s out for the season with a neck injury.\n\n\u201cReally nice,\u201d offensive coordinator Jeremy Bates said of McGuire\u2019s play. \u201cI was really fired up about him last year. A true pro, reminds me of Kevin Faulk. I thought he played very well.\u201d\n\nBRIGHT SPOT\n\nBuffalo\u2019s defense ranks third overall in the NFL, including third against the pass and 11th against the run.\n\nThe Bills were done in by offensive turnovers last week against the Bears, but they allowed only 190 yards of offense by Chicago. It was the fewest allowed since 103 in a 19-0 win vs. Miami in 2013. It was also the fewest in a Bills loss since a 20-6 defeat at Baltimore in 2004.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer John Wawrow contributed.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "TAMAQUA, Pa.

The Buffaloes are in the bottom half of the league for pass defense, allowing 237 yards a game, which means Minshew may get a chance to up his Heisman profile with a big day. Minshew has thrown for at least 300 yards in every game this season and leads the nation in completions per game (36.36), passing yards per game (390.8) and total offense per game (397.4). Minshew is a must-watch this season.\n\nNUMBERS GAME: The Pac-12 has four of the top seven running backs at the FBS level: Arizona State\u2019s Eno Benjamin (fifth, 123.7 yards per game), Arizona\u2019s J.J.

Must win.\u201d\n\nHere are some things to know about the Cowboys-Eagles prime-time matchup:\n\nDAK & CARSON\n\nWhen Dak Prescott led the Cowboys to a 13-3 record in 2016 while fellow rookie Carson Wentz was 7-9 with the Eagles, some thought Dallas got the better franchise quarterback \u2014 and in the fourth round. The Eagles traded a slew of draft picks to move up and select Wentz at No. 2 overall.\n\nBut Prescott is 12-12 since with 32 TDs, 18 interceptions and an 87.4 passer rating. There are even questions whether he\u2019s going to be the long-term answer in Dallas.\n\nMeanwhile, Wentz is 14-5 with 46 TDs, only nine picks, and a 104.5 rating in the past two seasons, though he missed last year\u2019s playoffs after tearing his ACL. He\u2019s undoubtedly the present and future in Philadelphia despite having to watch Nick Foles lead the team to its first NFL title since 1960.\n\nO-LINE WOES\n\nThe difficulties continue for Dallas\u2019 once-vaunted offensive line, which has surrendered 28 sacks of Prescott, just four shy of his career high halfway through the season. Rookie left guard Connor Williams had arthroscopic knee surgery after getting hurt in the loss to Tennessee and will miss at least one game.\n\nThe Cowboys appear set to leave Joe Looney at center. He\u2019s been there all season in place of four-time Pro Bowler Travis Frederick, out with a nerve disorder. If Looney stays put, left guard will be filled by either Adam Redmond or Xavier Su\u2019a-Filo.\n\nDALLAS VS. DALLAS\n\nEagles rookie tight end Dallas Goedert will face the team he was named after for the first time.\n\nPhiladelphia traded up in the second round and moved ahead of the Cowboys to select Goedert, who would\u2019ve helped replace retired Jason Witten in Dallas. Goedert has 18 receptions for 188 yards and three TDs while teammate Zach Ertz ranks first among tight ends with 61 catches.\n\nGoedert will hear plenty of \u201cDallas stinks!\u201d chants and worse. He knows fans won\u2019t be referring to him.\n\nPASS RUSH PUZZLE\n\nThe Cowboys are awaiting the return of defensive end Randy Gregory, who had knee surgery similar to Williams before the bye week and missed the last game. He was listed as limited in practice early in the week. Taco Charlton injured a shoulder against Tennessee and didn\u2019t practice to start the week. Defensive tackle David Irving, out the first four games on a substance-abuse suspension, is likely to miss a second straight game with a sprained ankle.\n\nDeMarcus Lawrence, who tied for second with 14\u00bd sacks last season, stopped a three-game sackless streak against the Titans. Daniel Ross and Tyrone Crawford had a sack apiece, while Caraun Reid and rookie Dorance Armstrong shared one.\n\nNEW PUNT RETURNER\n\nThe Eagles released DeAndre Carter, who was returning punts during Darren Sproles\u2019 absence. Sproles is expected to play after missing seven games with a hamstring injury. He has seven career TDs on punt returns. Tate also could be used in that role, though he hasn\u2019t done it much recently.\n\n___\n\nAP Pro Football Writer Schuyler Dixon contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "FILE - In this Oct. 17, 2007, file photo, wild mustangs from the Kiger Management Area near Diamond, Ore., are shown.

He had a profound effect on me and the team when he visited in 2015 and shared valuable lessons from his life story and ability to overcome.\u201d\n\nTriplett was inducted into the Cotton Bowl Hall of Fame this year, and his appearance in that game is part of Penn State lore.

He played in 18 games for Detroit from 1949-50.

(AP) \u2014 Josh McCown is going from mentor to starter this week for the New York Jets.\n\nThe 39-year-old quarterback will be under center Sunday against the Buffalo Bills in place of injured rookie Sam Darnold, who\u2019s sidelined with a strained right foot.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m ready to rule him out as a starter for this week,\u201d coach Todd Bowles said of Darnold on Thursday. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll rule him out yet for the game.\u201d\n\nThat means Darnold still could potentially be the No. 2 quarterback on Sunday. If not, Davis Webb would be promoted from the practice squad to serve as McCown\u2019s backup.\n\nEither way, the starting job is McCown\u2019s \u2014 at least for this week.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m extremely comfortable with him,\u201d Bowles said. \u201cWe talk all the time. He understands the game and the team, and we see things the same way. So I\u2019m comfortable.\u201d\n\nMcCown has not taken a snap in a regular-season game this season as the Jets have focused on developing Darnold. The No. 3 overall pick won the job out of training camp, but was injured during New York\u2019s 13-6 loss at Miami last Sunday.\n\nMcCown was the Jets\u2019 starter last season and had a career year before being sidelined the last three games with a broken left hand. Since the summer, McCown has spoken highly of Darnold and expressed excitement about being able to have a hand in the youngster\u2019s development.\n\nDarnold has received lots of advice and tips from McCown on the sideline and practice field. Now, he\u2019ll have no choice but to watch.\n\n\u201cI say it all the time: That\u2019s why we do this, to play,\u201d McCown said Wednesday when Darnold\u2019s injury was announced. \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, you\u2019re torn because your friend and a teammate, it means he can\u2019t go. In that regard, I don\u2019t wish that on anybody, but at the same time as a professional, as a backup quarterback you have to serve your team in that role and go in and play winning football.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s fun, that\u2019s what you look forward to and that\u2019s why you play this game. And, we\u2019ll go out and compete.\u201d\n\nThe Jets are ranked 29th in overall offense, including 28th in the passing game. Some of the struggles can be attributed to the inexperience of Darnold, who has an NFL-leading 14 interceptions. During New York\u2019s current three-game losing streak, the rookie has thrown two touchdown passes and seven INTs.\n\nSo, some might consider the injury a blessing in disguise. It allows Darnold to take a breather and give McCown a chance to perhaps get the offense back on track.\n\n\u201cObviously, Josh has played a long time in this league,\u201d wide receiver Jermaine Kearse said. \u201cSo throughout the weeks, he sees things a lot quicker. Just the mental aspects, he\u2019s a lot further, just with his experience and being in the league. So, him just being able to see things a lot quicker, you know, the tempo kind of picked up a little bit.\u201d\n\nBowles made it clear, however, that this is no long-term solution. When Darnold is healthy, he\u2019ll step right back into the starting role.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Bowles said, \u201che\u2019s our quarterback.\u201d\n\nEven if McCown is playing well when Darnold is fully healthy?\n\n\u201cSam is our quarterback,\u201d Bowles answered.\n\nBowles was then asked why that would automatically be the case with Darnold.\n\n\u201cBecause he\u2019s our starter and he won the job,\u201d the coach said. \u201cI feel comfortable with him in there and I feel comfortable with Josh in there.\u201d\n\nWhile Darnold is the easy target and he has shouldered the blame for the struggles on offense, the Jets have several other culprits. Center Spencer Long has dealt with a finger injury that has led to several wayward snaps out of the shotgun, disrupting the timing of plays. Wide receivers Quincy Enunwa and Robby Anderson have been dealing with ankle injuries, and there have been blown plays and dropped passes by several players.\n\n\u201cLike I\u2019ve said, we didn\u2019t play well as an offense,\u201d Bowles said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t play well last game, but there\u2019s a couple people that have had bad games here and there, so we go from there.\u201d\n\nOffensive coordinator Jeremy Bates has taken some heat, as well. The Jets are 18th in points with 198 and have scored just 17 touchdowns on offense. They also rank 30th in the league in first-down success (15.8 percent) and third-down conversions (30.8 percent).\n\n\u201cWe have to score more points and that\u2019s on me,\u201d Bates said. \u201cI need to put our players in better positions to be successful, need to put our players in better position to score touchdowns and that\u2019s my responsibility. We have to score points in this league to win football games.\u201d\n\nNOTES: CB Trumaine Johnson was a full participant at practice for the first time in more than a month after being sidelined with an injured right quadriceps.

Kobach rode his national reputation as an activist fighting illegal immigration and illegal voting to a spot leading President Donald Trump's short-lived voter fraud commission and the GOP nomination for Kansas governor as Trump's chosen candidate. That approach may have been rejected by Kansas voters, but it's likely to help him land his next high-profile role, and many fellow Republicans assume it will be a job in Trump's administration. (AP Photo/Orlin Wagner, File)\n\nTOPEKA, Kan. (AP) \u2014 Kris Kobach rode his national reputation as an advocate for tough immigration and voting rules to a job atop President Donald Trump\u2019s short-lived election-fraud commission. But Kansas voters rejected his no-apologies conservatism in this week\u2019s election for governor.\n\nNow the Republican\u2019s hard-line, in-your-face approach could help him land his next political position, possibly in the Trump administration.\n\nKobach\u2019s name immediately popped up Wednesday, after Attorney General Jeff Sessions was forced to resign. If Trump picks someone else to replace Sessions, Kobach\u2019s name is almost certain to surface again when Trump has another big post to fill.\n\n\u201cI guarantee you that if there is a place that he can find, he\u2019ll find a home for Kris,\u201d said state Rep. John Whitmer, a conservative Wichita Republican and a Kobach ally.\n\nKobach, whose term as Kansas secretary of state ends in January, did not immediately return cellphone messages Thursday seeking comment. Whitmer said Kobach had planned to go hunting. Kobach spokeswoman Danedri Herbert texted, \u201cNo comment,\u201d in response to a question about the speculation that Kobach was being considered for U.S. attorney general.\n\nIn his concession speech late Tuesday, the 52-year-old Ivy League graduate dropped no hints about his future. He told supporters at a Topeka hotel, \u201cThis one just wasn\u2019t God\u2019s will.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Republicans are going to be fighting for the values we hold dear, regardless of which offices we Republicans hold,\u201d he said.\n\nIn nearly eight years as secretary of state of state, Kobach turned what had been a backwater of state politics into a high-profile office by successfully pushing for laws to require all voters to show a photo ID at the polls and new voters to provide papers documenting their U.S. citizenship when registering.\n\nKansas went further than any other state in enforcing a proof-of-citizenship requirement in voter registration until a federal judge struck down that law in June as an unconstitutional violation of voting rights. The state has appealed, and the case is likely to outlast Kobach\u2019s tenure.\n\nBefore becoming vice chairman of the president\u2019s voter fraud commission, Kobach was a source behind Trump\u2019s unsubstantiated claim that millions of votes were cast illegally in the 2016 presidential race for Democrat Hillary Clinton, who won the popular vote.\n\nAn early supporter of Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, Kobach advised the campaign and later the White House on homeland security issues.\n\nThe day before the August primary, Trump tweeted his \u201cfull & total Endorsement!\u201d of Kobach, which helped him narrowly defeat GOP Gov. Jeff Colyer. Trump had a rally in Topeka in October partly to boost Kobach\u2019s campaign, telling the crowd he would have liked to put Kobach in his administration.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump is very supportive of Kris Kobach,\u201d state GOP Chairman Kelly Arnold said. \u201cAnd I expect a place will be found for him.\u201d\n\nRepublicans expanded their narrow 51-49 majority in the U.S Senate, potentially making a Kobach confirmation easier.\n\nThe narrow GOP majority had presented a possible obstacle. In July 2017, Trump nominated then-Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback as U.S. ambassador at large for international freedom. But the Senate did not vote to confirm the appointment until January. Vice President Mike Pence had to break a tie.\n\nKobach has been more of a lightning rod than Brownback and lost the governor\u2019s race because he alienated moderate GOP and independent voters. Frank Sharry, the executive director of the pro-immigration group America\u2019s Voice, celebrated Kobach\u2019s loss with a statement calling him \u201cone of the leading anti-immigrant voices in American politics.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf Trump wants to nominate him, it\u2019s going to be a fight,\u201d said Zachary Mueller, a member of the group\u2019s digital communications team. \u201cWhat was made very loud and clear on Tuesday was that Kansans said that he wasn\u2019t fit to lead the state of Kansas.\u201d\n\nIn a May 2017 interview with The Associated Press, Kobach said he had been offered an undersecretary\u2019s position in the Department of Homeland Security and a White House position coordinating immigration enforcement. The interview was after Trump named him to the election fraud commission but before Kobach formally launched his campaign for governor.\n\nHe said he faced \u201ca tough, tough decision\u201d on both. One factor in not taking the jobs, he said, was the likely inability to \u201cunilaterally make a decision and then say, \u2018OK, we\u2019re going to carry this out.\u2019\u201d\n\nKobach, who has five young daughters, also had misgivings about leaving Kansas.

Todd Young has launched a bid to become chairman of Senate Republicans\u2019 campaign committee during the 2020 campaign, a cycle where the GOP will face a tougher electoral map that could undermine their recent gains in the chamber.\n\nA formal election for the position won\u2019t be held until next Wednesday, but Young says his bid to lead the National Republican Senate Committee is supported by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. So far, he has not drawn an opponent.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really excited about the opportunity to be of service to my colleagues,\u201d Young said in an interview. \u201cThe committee did a lot to help my campaign back in 2016, and I think I can do a lot to make sure we defend and strengthen the Republican majority.\u201d\n\nA representative for McConnell didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nWhile Republicans expanded their slim 51-49 majority in the chamber during Tuesday\u2019s election, thanks largely to about a dozen Democrats running in red states that President Donald Trump won, the near opposite will be true in the coming cycle, which offers fewer pickup opportunities and more seats where Democrats are poised to be strong contenders.\n\nThat includes swing states like North Carolina, Maine and Colorado, as well as red states that are showing signs of trending toward Democrats, such as Georgia and Arizona.\n\nDespite the greater odds, Young says the map won\u2019t be as bad for them as it was for Democrats this year.\n\nStill to be seen, however, is what impact Trump will have as he seeks re-election. Trump hypercharged this year\u2019s midterm campaign, which was already viewed as a referendum on his presidency, by railing against migrants and the \u201cDemocrat mob\u201d in what was widely seen as coded appeals to white voters.\n\nRaces where Republicans won by greater margins on Tuesday were largely in pro-Trump states that skew rural.\n\nThey faced tighter outcomes, however, in places like Florida and Georgia with larger urban populations. Democrats, meanwhile, retook the House, a shift largely fueled by anti-Trump sentiment in suburban districts that previously voted for the GOP.\n\n\u201cI certainly acknowledge that the map has changed considerably when we look to the next cycle,\u201d Young said. \u201cWe are likely defending 22 incumbents.\u201d\n\nTwo states, in particular, are destined to be at the top of Democrats\u2019 list. Colorado, where outgoing NRSC head Gardner will be on the ballot, has increasingly trended away from Republicans in recent years. And in Maine, moderate Sen. Susan Collins is sure to face stiff opposition after infuriating the left with her vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court justice.\n\nYoung said Gardner has bipartisan credibility and has acted as an independent voice. Collins, he said, will have adequate support.\n\n\u201cSusan Collins is a tough campaigner. She has an exceptional record of achievement,\u201d Young said. \u201cShe will receive national support, and she is an incredibly strong fit for the state of Maine.\u201d\n\nWhile Young has not drawn an opponent for the NRSC job, Mitt Romney, who won a Utah Senate seat Tuesday, has been floated as a possibility.\n\nAs the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, Romney is a prolific fundraiser.

His speed has helped make him the second-leading rusher for the sixth-ranked Sooners.

Lamb is a superior playmaker who has a knack for the spectacular grab. He has 38 catches for 725 yards and a team-best nine scores.\n\nMorris, a former walk-on, has 16 catches for 353 yards, a team-best 22.1 yards per catch and eight touchdowns. He caught four passes for 101 yards and two scores against Texas Tech.

For him to play one year on varsity and do what he did, and come here and develop into how he\u2019s playing, that says a lot about his work ethic and his mindset and want-to.\u201d\n\nCalcaterra, a preseason all-conference pick at tight end, has 17 catches for 272 yards and two scores. He had some issues with drops earlier in the season, but he made some tough catches in traffic against Texas Tech.\n\n\u201cFor him, I think it\u2019s all in the head,\u201d Murray said. \u201cConfidence and just playing more. That\u2019s all it is. He\u2019s obviously got the ability to do it and do what he does. He\u2019s here for a reason. I think for him, it\u2019s just all playing more and getting confidence out there on the field.\u201d\n\nAfter he threw interceptions on Oklahoma\u2019s first two possessions, Murray came back to throw three touchdown passes \u2014 two to Morris and one to Meier. His 20 completions went to seven receivers, something Riley emphasizes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important,\u201d Riley said. \u201cThere\u2019s an art to that because you have to know who your guys are, too.

With the second-place Seahawks visiting the Coliseum on Sunday for a rematch, the Rams have a chance to essentially end the division race with seven weeks to go. (AP Photo/Scott Eklund, File)\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Although the Los Angeles Rams hadn\u2019t lost a game until last week, their spectacular season has featured several close calls.\n\nNot many were closer than their 33-31 victory just five weeks ago in Seattle, where the Seahawks racked up 190 yards rushing, intercepted two passes by Jared Goff and came agonizingly close to a huge NFC West win.\n\nWith the second-place Seahawks (4-4) visiting the Coliseum on Sunday for the rematch, the Rams (8-1) have a chance to essentially end the division race with seven weeks to go. The Rams aren\u2019t looking that far ahead, but Aaron Donald hopes Los Angeles will learn from that narrow win in Seattle \u2014 and a 45-35 loss at New Orleans last week.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a good place, and we\u2019re locked in,\u201d said the Rams\u2019 superstar defensive tackle, second in the NFL with 10 sacks. \u201cWe play these guys twice a year, so we\u2019ve got respect for them. We\u2019ve just got to get after them.\u201d\n\nThe Rams have never lost back-to-back regular-season games in their 1\u00bd seasons under Sean McVay, but they\u2019ve thrived primarily on the strength of an offense that has been able to outscore nearly every opponent, including the Seahawks. NFL scoring leader Todd Gurley rushed for three TDs in Seattle, and the Rams kept the ball out of Russell Wilson\u2019s hands in the final 3:38 by running out the clock.\n\nThe Seahawks also are coming off a loss after the Chargers won in Seattle last week, but the Seahawks know they can beat the Rams because they did it last season at the Coliseum.\n\nEven if the division race might already be out of hand, they\u2019ve got a chance to begin their playoff rally with a statement victory.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t allow them to score as many points as they put up,\u201d Seattle linebacker Bobby Wagner said. \u201cWe feel like we did a really good job against the run for the most part. We have to find a way to do that, make them one-dimensional, make sure Todd doesn\u2019t get into the end zone as many times as he did.\u201d\n\nMore things to watch in this NFC West showdown:\n\nTOUGH CHECK\n\nDonald has sacked Wilson eight times in their careers, more than any other quarterback. But Donald and the Rams didn\u2019t manage to sack Drew Brees last week, and they still have something to prove to the Seahawks \u2014 particularly to guard D.J. Fluker, who wasn\u2019t impressed by the toughness of the Los Angeles defense in the clubs\u2019 previous meeting.\n\nThe Seattle offensive lineman said the Rams \u201cwant to be pass rushers,\u201d but hadn\u2019t \u201cseen a team go out there and actually take it to them.\u201d Donald had no interest in starting a public discussion this week: \u201cWe\u2019re just going to go out there and play a game and let our play speak for us.\u201d\n\nRUN AROUND\n\nSeattle\u2019s impressive rushing performance in their first meeting with the Rams included 116 yards from Chris Carson, but he is in question for the rematch because of a hip injury that caused him to sit the final 2\u00bd quarters last week against the Chargers. Mike Davis and seldom-used Rashaad Penny probably would replace Carson.\n\nBut Seattle also has offensive line concerns after Fluker injured his calf late in the loss to the Chargers. Fluker\u2019s addition to the offensive line helped spark Seattle\u2019s turnaround in the run game starting in late September.\n\nGURLEY GOES\n\nGurley has scored a touchdown in a franchise-record 12 straight games, and his 868 yards rushing are the NFL\u2019s most by a whopping 162 yards over Pittsburgh\u2019s James Connor.\n\nGurley\u2019s 16 TDs this season are the most in the league and the second-most in NFL history through nine games, trailing only Jim Brown\u2019s 17 in 1958. That\u2019s the challenge facing Seattle\u2019s run defense, which is giving up 4.8 yards per attempt \u2014 tied for fourth-worst in the league \u2014 but has been effective in stretches.\n\nGET MARCUS\n\nFormer Washington Huskies defensive back Marcus Peters was targeted repeatedly by the Saints, and the Rams\u2019 top corner took the blame for much of Brees\u2019 success. The Seahawks undoubtedly saw the former Pro Bowl cover man\u2019s struggles on video, but Rams defensive coordinator Wade Phillips has limited options in the continued injury absence of cornerback Aqib Talib. The Rams\u2019 best solution might be increased pressure on Wilson, who has been sacked 25 times already this season.\n\nSAFETY PLAN\n\nBradley McDougald has been one of Seattle\u2019s defensive standouts, but with a quick turnaround to facing Aaron Rodgers and the Green Bay Packers next Thursday, McDougald may end up sitting out against the Rams because of a bothersome knee injury. If McDougald can\u2019t play, the Seahawks would turn to second-year safety Delano Hill, which could create an extremely young secondary. If Hill starts, he would play alongside second-year free safety Tedric Thompson, second-year cornerback Shaquill Griffin and rookie cornerback Tre Flowers. Nickel cornerback Justin Coleman, in his fourth season, would be the veteran of the group.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Tim Booth in Seattle contributed.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: www.apnews.com/NFL and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL", "", "Some of the deadliest mass shootings in modern US history\n\nSix of the 10 deadliest mass shootings in modern U.S. history have occurred since 2012.\n\nA list of some of the deadliest mass shootings:\n\n\u2014 Oct. 1, 2017: Stephen Paddock opened fire on an outdoor music festival on the Las Vegas Strip from the 32nd floor of a hotel-casino, killing 58 people and wounding more than 500.

They have been fired and a criminal investigation into their actions is coming to an end.\n\nNeither woman was violent, their advocates said during a Senate subcommittee hearing. Newton was only seeking medicine for her fear and anxiety the day she died, the attorney said, while Green\u2019s family said she was committed at a regular mental health appointment by a councilor she had never seen before.\n\nA system in South Carolina that treats nonviolent mental health patients more like criminals also contributed greatly to the women\u2019s deaths, Brittain told a state Senate panel Thursday.\n\n\u201cThey did wrong, serious wrong,\u201d Brittain said of the deputies. \u201cBut if she had never been in that cage, she\u2019d be out of that van, she\u2019d be alive today. The people who made those decisions with indifference to her rights are also responsible for her death.\u201d\n\nSheriff\u2019s offices don\u2019t like the system either because it too often pulls deputies off the street to take people who are safe enough to be transported by ambulances or other means, South Carolina Sheriff\u2019s Association Executive Director Jarrod Bruder said.\n\nA survey of about a third of the state\u2019s counties showed 4,200 mental patients have been transported by officers so far this year. Hospitals and doctors often demand deputies to take patients even though the law allows family members or friends to take responsibility for patients who aren\u2019t immediate threats to themselves or the community.\n\nThe hospitals are trying to avoid legal responsibility, said psychiatrist Christina Lynn.\n\n\u201cThen I spend my first day with them telling them they didn\u2019t get arrested,\u201d Lynn said.\n\nThe Senate subcommittee plans to keep hearing testimony as the General Assembly\u2019s session approaches in January. The three members agreed the law needs to be changed, and the Department of Mental Health may need more funds.\n\nDemocratic state Sen. Marlon Kimpson said he wanted to call the hearings as soon as possible after the September deaths because they were so horrible.\n\nA criminal investigation into the deputies is coming to an end and a report will be given to prosecutors, State Law Enforcement Division Chief Mark Keel said.\n\nKeel refused to give details on the conversation between the deputies and the National Guard troops blocking the highway, the depth of the water the officers were trying to drive through and what the deputies did to try to rescue the women, saying it was part of his agency\u2019s investigation.\n\nBut Brittain and Green\u2019s sister, Donnela Green-Johnson, filled in some of the details Thursday.\n\nBrittain told how what should have been a less than two-hour drive for the women inside the \u201ctiny cage\u201d from Horry County to Darlington had already been delayed by \u201ccoffee breaks and detours\u201d when the van drove around a barricade and a manned checkpoint and into a hole in the highway covered with water.\n\nThe van rolled to its side, blocking one door. The deputies didn\u2019t have the key to open the other, Brittain said.\n\n\u201cNo key, no combination, no bolt cutters. No nothing,\u201d Brittain said. \u201cHe climbed on top to save himself and the other officer and listened as water engulfed the van moment, after moment after moment as each woman saw her death rise in the water.\u201d\n\nGreen\u2019s daughter was with her that day and didn\u2019t forcefully request she be allowed to take her mother. Now she feels like she sent her mom to die, Green-Johnson said.\n\n\u201cIt was a horrible way for those two women to die. They knew.

Two ranchers in eastern Oregon are working with state wildlife officials to test a new strategy for preventing wolf attacks on livestock. (Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife via AP, File)\n\nSALEM, Ore. (AP) \u2014 Two ranchers in eastern Oregon are working with the state to test a new strategy for preventing livestock attacks by wolves with the hope of breaking an impasse between conservationists and ranchers on how to manage the predators.\n\nRodger Huffman, president of the Union County Cattlemen\u2019s Association, and Cynthia Warnock, president of the Wallowa County Stockgrowers Association, will develop plans that emphasize non-lethal methods such as range riders, alarm boxes and electrified fencing to keep wolves away from their livestock, the Capital Press reported Thursday.\n\nIf wolves continue to attack, then ranchers could ask the state to kill them \u2014 a more streamlined approach than currently exists, the newspaper reported.\n\nThe ranchers agreed to test the idea, but it\u2019s still unclear who would pay for the non-lethal tools and whether or not the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife has the staff and resources to monitor individual wolf plans for all farmers and ranchers affected by the predators.\n\nThe proposal was outlined by stakeholders who are trying to find common ground on a five-year update of the state\u2019s wolf conservation and management plan, which is now three years overdue.\n\nParticipants in the work group include a mix of farming, ranching, hunting and environmental interests, led by Deb Nudelman, a professional mediator hired from Portland.\n\nODFW staff wrote a draft seven-step strategy, which they presented back to the group during a conference call Nov. 5. It essentially calls for wildlife biologists to meet with farmers and ranchers on the ground and help them select non-lethal wolf deterrents based on individual operations and geography.\n\nProducers would not be eligible for a kill order if they do not have a conflict deterrence plan in place, though they could still apply for state compensation for lost or dead animals.\n\nWolf advocates say the site-specific plans will prioritize and make the best use of non-lethal tools, while ranchers hope the proposal gives them a quicker and clearer path to dealing with problem wolves.\n\n\u201cI think we all want to make sure that whatever end product we have is as clear and transparent as possible for everybody,\u201d said Amaroq Weiss, West Coast wolf advocate at the Center for Biological Diversity.\n\nHuffman, who ranches in Union, Oregon, where wolves from the Catherine pack are active, said it remains to be seen if ranchers themselves would bear the added cost of the non-lethal deterrants.\n\nBefore wolves returned to Oregon, Huffman said he checked on cattle once every few weeks. Now, he checks on cattle at least three times per week, and sometimes even that is not enough.\n\nState wildlife officials have investigated one dead calf on his property, in 2016, though by the time they found the animal after five days it was too late to confirm it as a wolf kill.\n\n\u201cThere really wasn\u2019t much left of it,\u201d Huffman said.\n\nWarnock\u2019s ranch near Imnaha, Oregon, is also frequented by wolves in far northeast Wallowa County.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Capital Press, http://www.capitalpress.com/washington", "The Latest: New Colorado governor vows to defend public land\n\nDENVER (AP) \u2014 The Latest on the 2018 election\u2019s impact on the outdoor industry (all times local):\n\n1 p.m.\n\nColorado Gov.-elect Jared Polis is pledging to protect the state\u2019s public lands and promote its outdoor recreation industry.\n\nPolis, a Democrat, spoke Thursday at the Outdoor Retailer Winter Market in Denver, a trade show of outdoor goods.\n\nPolis said outdoor recreation provides 229,000 jobs and $2 billion a year in state and local tax revenue in Colorado, and he promised to be an \u201cevangelist\u201d for the industry.\n\nPolis is currently a U.S. representative.

In the early to mid-1800s, Americans of means collected what they saw as exotica in Egypt, where the ceremonially preserved bodies were plentiful.\n\nMendes I. Cohen, A War of 1812 veteran, acquired a mummy in Egypt in 1834, brought it back to Baltimore, and left it to the university when he died in 1879. John F. Goucher, a local minister, missionary and educator, acquired a mummy in 1895 and brought it to Baltimore, where he donated it to the school he\u2019d founded, the Baltimore Woman\u2019s College, later renamed Goucher College. It ended up at the Baltimore Museum of Art.\n\n\u201cThey were often seen as curiosities that belonged in sideshows, freak shows and dime museums,\u201d said Meg Swaney, a doctoral student in Near Eastern Studies at Hopkins and co-curator of the exhibit. \u201cPeople weren\u2019t sure whether to display them in natural history museums, or in art museums for the artifacts they came with. But there was so much curiosity, every museum wanted one.\u201d\n\nBalachandran\u2019s team, a group that included Swaney and six undergraduates, worked with Caroline Wilkinson, the director of Face Lab, a research group at Liverpool John Moores University in England that carries out forensic and archaeological research. Dr. Elliot K. Fishman, a professor of radiology and the director of diagnostic imaging at Johns Hopkins Hospital, performed a CT scan on the bodies, and those images provided information for three-dimensional representations.\n\nResearchers contributed other details including pelvic marks that showed both were female and tooth conditions that suggested ages of about 45 or 50. Face Lab built its illustrations out over two years.\n\nThe team faced a range of ethical questions along the way, voting for two-dimensional portraits over three-dimensional busts.\n\n\u201cEveryone felt it would risk being too macabre or creating too much of a spectacle,\u201d said Swaney, who specializes in the ethics involved in displaying Egyptian remains. They also agreed to render the portraits in grays since no reliable evidence exists regarding skin tone.\n\nFor Balachandran, the exhibit is a new way of looking into the ancient past.\n\n\u201cThese women look at you the moment you walk in the door; you\u2019re looking at them, and they\u2019re looking at you,\u201d she said. \u201cIt feels as though they\u2019re right here with us.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Baltimore Sun, http://www.baltimoresun.com", "No. 7 West Virginia tries to stay in 1st in Big 12 vs. TCU\n\nTCU (4-5, 2-4 Big 12) at No. 7 West Virginia (7-1, 5-1, No. 9 CFP), noon EST (FS1)\n\nLine: West Virginia by 11\u00bd.\n\nSeries record: TCU leads 4-3.\n\nWHAT\u2019S AT STAKE?\n\nWest Virginia is tied for first place with Oklahoma and can move a step closer to a berth in the Big 12 championship game.

He outlined his intentions to pursue legislation to halt the flow of illegal guns into New Jersey from other states, as well as legislation on smart guns, or weapons that can be fired only by an authorized user. But he has not so far detailed those proposals.\n\nIt is already unlawful to make a handgun, rifle or shotgun without a license, and manufacturing a machine gun, sawed-off shotgun, or assault firearm is also illegal.\n\nThe new law bars the purchase of separate parts or kits that could be used to manufacture a firearm not traceable by law enforcement.

Baylor, ranked 91st nationally in passing defense, will need to find a way to neutralize Butler if it hopes to spring the upset.\n\nPLAYERS TO WATCH\n\nBaylor: QB Charlie Brewer. The sophomore starter came off the bench after dealing with concussion-like symptoms to lead last week\u2019s comeback over Oklahoma State. Brewer is completing 68 percent of his passes this season.\n\nIowa State: RB David Montgomery. Only nine teams in the country are allowing more yards per carry than the 5.5 Baylor gives up. Iowa State will likely hand it off to Montgomery, who has rushed for at least 100 yards in four of his last five games, as often as possible.\n\nFACTS & FIGURES\n\nBaylor has blocked five kicks this season, the second most in America. ...Throw out the four non-offensive touchdowns Iowa State has allowed in conference play, and the Cyclones\u2019 defense is giving up just 19.3 points in league games. ...The Bears lead the Big 12 in time of possession average at 32:29. ...Iowa State has held half of its opponents below 300 yards of offense. ... Baylor LB Clay Johnston had 14 solo tackles in last week\u2019s 35-31 win over Oklahoma State. ...

In order to avoid the ignominy, the Bengals (5-3) are going to have to stop an offense that\u2019s been lighting it up.\n\nHello, Drew Brees.\n\nThe Saints (7-1) have won seven straight and are coming off a 45-35 win that sent the Rams to their first loss. New Orleans piled up 487 yards behind Brees, who leads the NFL in completion rate (76.3 percent) and passer rating (120.6). He\u2019s been sacked a league-low nine times.\n\nIf the Bengals fail to get a hand on him, it could be history .\n\n\u201cThey go as Brees goes,\u201d defensive end Carlos Dunlap said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to find a way to slow down that future Hall of Famer.\u201d\n\nThe biggest challenge for the Saints will be keeping the momentum in their only road game during a four-week span. They return home to play the Eagles and Falcons the next two weeks.\n\nAlthough the Bengals have given up the most yards in the NFL, the defense has scored four touchdowns on interception and fumble returns, playing a big factor in three of their wins.\n\nThe Saints can\u2019t afford to get off to a bad start that gives the Bengals the advantage. Also, it would help if the Saints tidied up their defense a bit.\n\nWhile the Bengals are historically bad \u2014 on pace to give up more than 7,000 yards \u2014 the Saints are also struggling on defense. They rank 25th overall, including second-worst in pass defense. They\u2019ve been among the worst at stopping opponents inside the 20-yard line. The Rams overcame an 18-point halftime deficit and tied it 35-35 in the fourth quarter.\n\nNew Orleans would like fewer shootouts in the second half of the season.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a ton of things we have to improve on and we need to improve on, or it\u2019s going to hurt us later,\u201d coach Sean Payton said.\n\nSome things to watch Sunday at Paul Brown Stadium:\n\nTHE NEW GUY\n\nNew Orleans signed former Cowboys receiver Dez Bryant on Wednesday . It\u2019s unclear what role \u2014 if any \u2014 he\u2019ll play this week as he tries to learn the offense. Deep threat Ted Ginn Jr. is hurt, and the Saints hope Bryant can add another dimension to the offense once he gets acclimated.\n\n\u201cI look forward to building a rapport with him,\u201d Brees said. \u201cI look forward to getting him involved in this offense and just become a complement to all the guys that we already have.\u201d\n\nTHOMAS\u2019 TIME\n\nWhile Bryant\u2019s arrival gets attention, Michael Thomas remains the Saints\u2019 biggest threat. He set a franchise record last week with 211 yards receiving, including his 72-yard touchdown late in the fourth quarter. With half the season still remaining, Thomas has 70 catches for 880 yards and five TDs.\n\nBIGGEST BLEMISH\n\nThe Saints\u2019 most glaring problems on defense have come near the goal line. New Orleans\u2019 opponents have scored touchdowns on 20 of 28 drives (71.4 percent). That ranks 28th out of 32 teams in defensive red zone efficiency.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t find any team having success later in the season with the numbers that we currently have,\u201d Payton said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to find a way to improve that.\u201d\n\nThe Bengals lead the league in scoring touchdowns once they get inside the 20-yard line, reaching the end zone on 20 of their 26 such possessions. They\u2019ve scored touchdowns on eight of their past nine trips inside the 20.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had some really good schemes,\u201d Andy Dalton said. \u201cAt the end of the day, our guys have made the plays.\u201d\n\nOH THAT HISTORY\n\nNo NFL team has given up three straight 500-yard games. The 1963 Jets gave up three 500-yard games within a four-game span \u2014 510 to the Chargers, 505 to the Raiders, 317 to the Broncos and 528 to the Chargers again. In its past three games, Cincinnati has allowed 481 to the Steelers, 551 to the Chiefs and 576 to the Buccaneers.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re underachieving right now,\u201d Dunlap said. \u201cWe\u2019re playing well enough to win some games, which is why we\u2019re 5-3. If we work on the negatives, we can be that elite defense and that elite team.\u201d\n\nMISSING GREEN\n\nA.J. Green caught a 13-yard touchdown pass with 7 seconds left for a win in Atlanta. He had two catches that moved the Bengals into range for their winning field goal against Tampa Bay before they headed into their bye last week. He also hurt a toe on his right foot on the final catch and is sidelined indefinitely, costing Cincinnati its most dependable receiver.\n\n\u201cIt is a huge impact,\u201d Payton said. \u201cHe is someone that commands a ton of coverage respect.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writers Brett Martel in Metairie, Louisiana, and Joe Reedy in Los Angeles contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) \u2014 Arkansas voters approved an amendment to the state\u2019s constitution allowing licenses for four casinos: two existing gambling facilities and two others that will be built.\n\nAbout 54 percent of voters approved of the amendment Tuesday. Retired Little Rock resident Robert Bradley said he voted for casinos to keep gambling money in Arkansas.\n\n\u201cPeople take the money out of their hometown,\u201d Bradley said. \u201cIt\u2019s better for the city, for the people. There\u2019s more jobs.\u201d\n\nNow questions remain about where and when gambling will happen, and about how much revenue the casinos will generate.\n\nWhere will the casinos be?\n\nThe amendment provides for four casino licenses. Two of those licenses will be given to already existing electronic gaming facilities at racetracks: Southland Park Gaming and Racing, a greyhound track in West Memphis, and Oaklawn Racing and Gaming, a thoroughbred racetrack in Hot Springs. The other two licenses will be awarded to casinos after an application process and will be constructed in Jefferson and Pope counties.\n\nNotably, the amendment passed in all but 11 counties, and of those that did not support the amendment, Pope County residents had the strongest opposition. About 60 percent of voters in Pope County opposed it. In Jefferson County, by comparison, nearly 65 percent were in favor.\n\nState Sen. Breanne Davis said that Pope County residents were concerned that they were being written into the constitution without having a say. The county voted 68 percent in favor of a local ordinance which mandates a local election before the county judge can write a letter of support for a casino, an amendment-mandated part of a casino group\u2019s application.\n\nJohn Berrey, chairman of the Quapaw Tribe, said they intend to apply for a license to build a casino in Pine Bluff. It\u2019s not clear who else intends to apply, but along with the Cherokee Nation, the two Oklahoma tribes donated more than $5.8 million to the campaign in favor of the amendment.\n\nWhen will the casinos open?\n\nBefore casinos can be officially opened, licenses must be awarded. The deadline for awarding licenses to Oaklawn and Southland is June 30, 2019 \u2014 but if everything runs smoothly, licenses could be issued earlier.\n\nAccording to a spokesman, table games at Southland should be running \u201cas soon as is feasible,\u201d while a spokeswoman for Oaklawn said they do not have date yet.\n\nIf the Quapaw Tribe is awarded a license for a Pine Bluff casino, a spokesman for the tribe said they hope to have a casino running by early 2020.\n\nHow much money will this generate?\n\nThe state Department of Finance and Administration estimates that by giving Oaklawn and Southland full casino licenses, the state will lose around $36 million in general revenue over two years. That\u2019s because right now the facilities are taxed as electronic games of skill, which is a higher tax rate than casino gaming.\n\nBut the state is using projections based on the money the casinos made solely as electronic gaming facilities.\n\nSupporters say the casinos will generate far more income with additional gambling games and sports wagering. A previous study commissioned by a group advocating for the casinos found the casinos could generate $39 million in annual state and local revenue.\n\nAnd the state does believe the casinos eventually will be profitable.\n\n\u201cAs the casinos operate, we do anticipate it\u2019ll get closer to the numbers that the electronic gaming is generating and will ultimately result in additional revenue for the state,\u201d Hardin said.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear right now how the state intends to make up the projected deficit.

(AP) \u2014 In a story Nov. 7 about Kentucky House races, The Associated Press reported erroneously that the GOP edge in the Kentucky House is 58-36. Republicans won 59 seats on Tuesday while Democrats won 35.\n\nA corrected version of the story is below:\n\nGOP supermajority in Kentucky hinges on outcome of 6 races\n\nRepublican hopes of maintaining a supermajority in the state House of Representatives hinge on the results of six races that are still too close to call\n\nBy ADAM BEAM\n\nAssociated Press\n\nFRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) \u2014 Republican hopes of maintaining the party\u2019s supermajority in the state House of Representatives hinge on the results of six races that are still too close to call, including an agonizingly close race in western Kentucky where the candidates are separated by just one vote.\n\nRepublicans entered the 2018 election with a 62-47 majority in the 100-seat House of Representatives, with one vacancy. Republicans won 59 seats on Tuesday while Democrats won 35. A supermajority requires 60 votes, making it easier for the political party in power to pass its agenda without getting help from the other side. The House requires at least 60 votes to send proposed constitutional amendments to the voters or to raise revenue or spend money in odd-numbered years.\n\nCumulatively, fewer than 100 votes separate the candidates in the six outstanding House races. Candidates have until Tuesday at 4 p.m. to ask for a recanvass, a process through which election officials double-check vote totals to make sure there are no mistakes. Recanvasses rarely change the outcome of elections. After that, candidates could ask for a recount, but they would have to pay for it themselves.\n\nOf the six House races in dispute, Democrats are leading in four of them. If the results hold, it would give Republicans exactly 60 votes when the legislature reconvenes in January.\n\nThree incumbents were in danger of losing their seats. In Daviess County, Democrat Jim Glenn leads Republican DJ Johnson by just one vote out of the 12,637 votes cast. Glenn, a college professor, held the seat for five terms before losing to Johnson in 2016. Johnson said he plans to ask for a recanvass.\n\n\u201cWe absolutely owe it to all the voters to make sure everything is 100 percent accurate,\u201d he said.\n\nIn Hardin and Meade counties, six-term incumbent Democrat Jeff Greer was losing to Republican Nancy Tate by just six votes. Greer said he will likely ask for a recanvass and pay for a recount.\n\n\u201cSix votes is a hard pill to swallow. But, I don\u2019t want to portray myself as a sore loser or one untrusting of the system. But I\u2019ve got to explore my options,\u201d Greer said. \u201cI\u2019ve got to pay for the recount, but I\u2019ll go out and pick up aluminum cans and come up with the money somehow.\u201d\n\nFive-term Republican incumbent Jill York said she would ask for a recanvass after unofficial results showed her trailing Democrat Kathy Hinkle by five votes in district 96. In district 91, Democrat Cluster Howard was leading Republican Rep. Toby Herald by just seven votes. Herald ousted Howard from the seat in 2016.\n\nIn district 81, Republicans hope to hang on to a seat held by GOP Rep. Wesley Morgan, who lost in the May primary. Republican Deanna Frazier was leading Morgan Eaves by 24 votes. Democrats are in position to pick up the seat held by retiring GOP Rep. Robert Benvenuti in district 81, where Democrat Cherlynn Stevenson leads Republican Bill Farmer by 48 votes. Farmer said he would ask for a recanvass.\n\nIn the state Senate, Democrat Dorsey Ridley was the only incumbent to be defeated, losing to Republican state Rep. Robby Mills. The loss means Democrats will have just 10 out of 38 Senate seats. But Democrats were able to pick up Mills\u2019 House seat when Democrat Rob Wiederstein defeated Republican James Buckmaster in a district that covers parts of Daviess and Henderson counties.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected.

The state\u2019s overall score for the 2017-2018 school year was 76.1. It\u2019s down from previous years. But officials note that\u2019s because there is a new scoring formula as the state adopts increasingly higher standards. It would have been a 93 \u2014 an increase over previous years \u2014 under the old formula.\n\nFour of Louisiana\u2019s 70 school districts received an A in the figures released Thursday; 35 districts earned a B; 25 a C. Four districts had a D and two, an F.\n\nIn a telephone news conference Superintendent of Education John White said the rollout reflects changes the state has made to comply with the federal Every Student Succeeds Act. Changes include the requirement, being phased in, that the average student at a school demonstrate mastery of content before the school can receive an A. Parents and others can find out how a school fared by using a new online tool dubbed the Louisiana School Finder. The school finder also includes information on each school\u2019s course offerings and extracurricular activities.\n\nWhite pointed to signs of continued progress in Louisiana public education, some of which had been reported earlier. A four-year state graduation rate of 78.2 percent in 2017 was the highest in the state\u2019s history. Forty-eight percent of 2017 graduates earned college credit or career credentials valued in high-wage industries, up from 43 percent the year before. And ACT scores indicating college readiness are up 40 percent since 2012.\n\nWhite said student performance in English and math was steady last year, but the percentage demonstrating mastery in social studies increased.\n\nSchool performance scores are based on student performance on standardized tests and on student improvement over a year. Other elements of the scores include dropout and on-time graduation rates, ACT scores, and whether students are taking college-level classes, according to the department.\n\nEvaluation of government funded early childhood education \u2014 in early childhood centers, Head Start programs and pre-kindergarten sites \u2014 was based on 14,000 observations at nearly 5,300 classrooms, according to an Education Department release. Factors in early childhood education evaluation included a classroom\u2019s emotional environment, classroom organization and instructional support. While improvement was measurable, the department said many children are still not getting proper preparation for kindergarten. And access is uneven.

He wants the league\u2019s 425 players to remain amateurs and not become employees regulated by labor legislation.\n\nMichael Tibollo, minister of Tourism, Culture and Sport, replied: \u201cI want you to know that our government is behind you.\u201d\n\nBranch is also president of the Canadian Hockey League, of which the OHL is part along with the Western Hockey League and Quebec Major Junior Hockey League. He considers major junior players \u2014 typically from 16 to 20 years old \u2014 student-athletes.\n\nPlayers are eligible for post-secondary school scholarships. Each season in the league is worth one year of tuition, books and fees. Players also get money for out-of-pocket expenses, equipment and travel costs.\n\n\u201cTo us it\u2019s the best scholarship program in North America,\u201d Branch said.\n\nNot everyone agrees. A $180 million lawsuit was filed in 2014 against the Canadian Hockey League on behalf of all current and many former players for outstanding wages and other pay. If the Ontario court rules for the players, Branch says some teams could fold.\n\nIf players were paid the $14 hourly minimum wage for a 40-hour work week over an eight-month season, it would cost the OHL about $8 million a year.\n\nBranch\u2019s letter to the Ontario government also cited the involvement of player agents.

Spikula said officials in northern Nevada\u2019s most populous county had planned for 60 percent turnout.\n\nAuthorities didn\u2019t field reports of fraud or illegal activity during midterm elections, said Wayne Thorley, deputy Nevada secretary of state.\n\nThe state last year replaced aging voting machines in 16 counties with upgraded machines that print and store a paper copy of the electronic vote, Thorley said. Carson City uses a different electronic system that prints a ballot that the voter hands to a poll worker.\n\nThere was no immediate indication the changeover was responsible for the lengthy delays, Thorley said.\n\nStatewide, 62 percent of the Nevada\u2019s eligible voters chose a new U.S. senator and governor, as well as decided other races including for the U.S. House, six ballot questions and seats in the Legislature.\n\nBut the outcomes on all those races were delayed more than three hours as election officials waited for the last vote to be cast before releasing any results.\n\nIn Las Vegas, where the longest lines stretched more than two hours, one Republican Party poll observer attributed delays to the sharp reduction in the number of polling places since 2016, an underestimation of voter turnout and a policy change that let people in four of the state\u2019s most populous areas \u2014 Clark, Washoe and Douglas counties and Carson City \u2014 vote anywhere they wanted.\n\nPreviously voters had to cast election day ballots at designated precinct polling places.\n\nClark County, home to three of the state\u2019s largest cities and seven in 10 of the state\u2019s voters, went from 272 polling places in 2016 to 172 at-large vote centers on Tuesday. More than 223,000 voters cast Election Day ballots in the Las Vegas area.\n\nKulin said voter volume caused the delays, and Thorley called it premature to conclude that a reduction in polling sites in Clark County caused long lines.\n\nHowever, \u201cThis was the first time where you could vote anywhere in the county instead of your own precinct,\u201d said Erven Nelson, a lawyer and former Nevada state Assemblyman who monitored polling stations in Las Vegas.\n\n\u201cI think it was a combination of people waiting until after work to go to the polls and equipment malfunctions like running out of paper,\u201d said Nelson, who watched voting continue until nearly 8 p.m. at an elementary school that provided 10 voting machines for most of the day.\n\nIn the evening, vote machine printers ran out of paper, and the site only had six backup printers, Nelson said. Four machines were idled during the hour it took for the line of voters to cast their ballots.\n\nA similar problem occurred at a Las Vegas high school where voters waited in line for two hours. Election officials had to deliver more printers, Kulin said.\n\nThe 17 counties are due to submit reports about their elections to the state by Jan. 7, Thorley said. \u201cAs we go through the postelection processes, we will work cooperatively with the counties to identify areas to improve,\u201d he said.\n\nSpikula, in Reno, said two sites with long lines after 9 p.m. were in Cold Springs and Sun Valley, two fast-growing areas north of Reno. In the end, everybody who wanted to vote did, she said.\n\n\u201cCan we do better in the future?\u201d Spikula said. \u201cYes, we can.\u201d\n\n____\n\nSonner reported from Reno.", "San Jose State (1-8, 1-4 Mountain West) at No. 14 Utah State (8-1, 5-0), 4 p.m. EST (Facebook)\n\nLine: Utah State by 31.\n\nSeries record: San Jose State 20-17-1\n\nWHAT\u2019S AT STAKE?\n\nUtah State has rolled to eight straight wins and has a one-game lead over Boise State atop the Mountain Division in the Mountain West Conference.

(AP) \u2014 Rhode Island Democrats on Thursday endorsed Democratic House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello to remain in his powerful leadership post despite female lawmakers\u2019 calls for a change.\n\nTheir caucus was Thursday night in Cranston. Mattiello received 44 votes; he needed 38.\n\nMost of the 21 Democrats who didn\u2019t back Mattiello are women. Several said they felt that the legislative process isn\u2019t transparent and that Mattiello is dismissive of women\u2019s issues.\n\nThe Rhode Island National Organization for Women and the Rhode Island Coalition Against Gun Violence had asked lawmakers to oust Mattiello as speaker. Mattiello has also recently faced criticism over his handling of sexual harassment claims at the State House.\n\nThe speaker is officially elected by all 75 House members in January. With enough votes from Democrats, Mattiello is guaranteed the job because there are few Republican representatives.\n\nProtesters who gathered outside the caucus at the Chapel Grille restaurant were dispersed by police for being on private property.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Charlene Lima said she supported Mattiello because he has \u201cmoved this state in the right direction as far as jobs, the economy and making it easier for businesses.\u201d She was chosen as part of his leadership team Thursday.\n\nNo one ran against Mattiello for speaker.\n\nMattiello said the vote shows that moderate and conservative Democrats are \u201csolidly behind\u201d him. He said he\u2019ll reach out to \u201cprogressives.\u201d He has called his opponents \u201cextreme progressives.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe story is, I\u2019ve got enough votes to be speaker even with a coordinated attack on me,\u201d he said after the vote. \u201cIt was coordinated before my election and designed to effect the election.\u201d\n\nMattiello was narrowly re-elected in his Cranston district Tuesday.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Teresa Tanzi said it isn\u2019t about ideology, it\u2019s about leadership. The legislative process should be more open and transparent, she said, and the speaker shouldn\u2019t single-handedly control which bills come to the floor.\n\n\u201cEven if a majority of the members wanted something passed or a majority of committee members wanted it, he alone chose what lived and died. And that\u2019s impacting the entire state,\u201d she said. \u201cOne person should not be the sole gatekeeper, especially one person who was barely re-elected in his district.\u201d\n\nDemocratic Rep. Kathleen Fogarty read a statement outside the Chapel Grille on behalf of the dissenters. She said they are conservative, moderate and progressive Democrats, and they talked during the caucus about the \u201cmockery of the committee process, the lack of transparency, the lack of trust and certainly the lack of respect.\u201d She said they\u2019ve received no assurances anything will change.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very telling that a lot of us here are women,\u201d added Democratic Rep. Moira Walsh. \u201cBecause as a general rule, the speaker of the House does not listen to the women vote.\u201d\n\nWalsh talked about how Democratic Rep. Edie Ajello, a longtime abortion rights advocate, hasn\u2019t been able to get legislation passed to protect reproductive rights. Ajello also voted against Mattiello.\n\nHouse Republicans are also looking for reforms to the way the House operates, said Republican Rep. Blake Filippi, the new House minority leader.\n\nMattiello said he\u2019s always willing to see if there\u2019s a way to do things better.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to have an open door and work with people,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll put together as good of a process as we can.\u201d\n\nDemocrats in the Senate met for their caucus Thursday at the State House.

Shawn McKnight released a complete list of the names that followed an internal investigation begun in February. The list includes 25 priests from the diocese, three priests from other areas who previously served in the Jefferson City diocese, and five members of a religious order.\n\nFourteen of the 33 men named are dead. Many of them are elderly. The diocese said the most recent case of physical sexual abuse found in the investigation occurred in 1997. He said only one man on the list was criminally convicted.\n\n\u201cAlthough the incidents are in the past, the pain caused is still a present reality for the survivors of abuse and their loved ones,\u201d McKnight said in a statement. He apologized for the actions of the priests and brothers, \u201cand the incomplete transparency we have lived under by not making all their names public.\u201d\n\nMcKnight said another 18 allegations have been made since August, and internal investigations into some of those claims are ongoing. He encouraged any additional victims to come forward.\n\nMcKnight said the diocese has spent $2.3 million on survivors of abuse since July 2003 and $2.1 million on the care of \u201ccredibly accused diocesan priests.\u201d\n\nDavid Clohessy, St. Louis director of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, or SNAP, called the list \u201cirresponsibly and painfully short on details.\u201d\n\nMcKnight \u201cshould reveal where each of these men worked, when they were accused, when those allegations were deemed credible, why the years of secrecy, and where the men are now,\u201d Clohessy said in a statement.\n\nMcKnight told reporters that he was not \u201ctrying to hide something\u201d by declining to say where the men had served. He said many of them had served in a variety of places. He said it would be misleading to report only where allegations were made and also said some victims asked him not to reveal that kind of information.\n\nThe internal investigation is unrelated to an investigation announced in August by Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley, in which the Diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph, the Diocese of Jefferson City, the Diocese of Springfield-Cape Girardeau and the Archdiocese of St. Louis all agreed to open their records.\n\nHawley\u2019s announcement came amid renewed concern about sexual abuse by priests that followed the release of a scathing report in Pennsylvania citing abuse of more than 1,000 children by hundreds of priests since the 1940s, along with cover-up by church leaders.\n\nMary Compton, a spokeswoman for Hawley, said that investigation is \u201cactive and ongoing,\u201d but offered no timetable for when it will be completed.\n\n\u201cWe are working as quickly as possible to carefully and thoroughly review all evidence obtained by our office,\u201d Compton said in a statement. \u201cThe Pennsylvania Grand Jury completed its work in two years.

This week we\u2019re competitors.\u201d\n\nIn his first season as an NFL head coach with Tennessee, Vrabel gets his first crack at both his old coach and former team Sunday when the Titans (4-4) host the Patriots (7-2).\n\nThe men share some of the same philosophies about football, though not personalities.\n\nTitans cornerback Logan Ryan, who spent his first four seasons in New England, says Vrabel\u2019s also younger and taller than Belichick. Vrabel may dress a bit better too during games, and Ryan sees some other similarities.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re hard-nosed. They care about the fundamentals,\u201d Ryan said.\n\nFor his part, Belichick says Vrabel will be a great coach with his passion and football knowledge as a player easily carrying over. Belichick also believes Vrabel deserves to be recognized in the Patriots Hall of Fame and yes, the Nashville native cheers for Vrabel and the Titans every game except this one.\n\n\u201cIt will be the Patriots against the Titans,\u201d Belichick said. \u201cThat\u2019s what it will be.\u201d\n\nThe Patriots have won six straight after beating Green Bay 31-17 last week. They also have won the past seven against the Titans, including playoffs, with the most recent a 35-14 romp in the divisional round last January. The Titans snapped a three-game skid Monday night with a 28-14 win in Dallas.\n\nSome things to know about the Patriots and Titans:\n\nLAST THREE\n\nOnly a trio remains of those who played alongside Vrabel during his tenure in New England: Brady, kicker Stephen Gostkowski and special teams captain Matt Slater. Brady spent eight seasons with Vrabel from 2001 to 2008. Gostkowski arrived in 2006, and Slater was a rookie during Vrabel\u2019s final season in 2008 before being traded.\n\n\u201cHis body can do it longer than mine could at the position that he plays,\u201d Vrabel said of Brady.\n\nNEW ENGLAND TIES\n\nPatriots cornerback Jason McCourty spent his first eight seasons with the Titans and now plays alongside twin brother, Devin, in New England. Trying to rebuild, Tennessee has stocked up on former Patriots including general manager Jon Robinson, Vrabel, Ryan, right guard Josh Kline. Robinson signed cornerback Malcolm Butler and running back Dion Lewis this offseason. Also, Titans defensive coordinator Dean Pees was an assistant and coordinator with the Patriots. He was the linebackers coach in 2004-05 and defensive coordinator in New England from 2006-2009.\n\nPatriots wide receiver Julian Edelman called Lewis a fiery jitterbug.\n\n\u201cHe meant a lot to me when he was here. Now I hate him,\u201d Edelman said with a smile.\n\nDEFENDING BRADY: Brady enters this game having won five straight against the Titans. His lone loss came in 2002 in a 24-7 setback during Brady\u2019s third year in the league. That also was his only meeting with the Titans in which he didn\u2019t have a touchdown pass and the only time he threw an interception.\n\nIn six regular-season meetings with Tennessee, Brady has thrown for 1,561 yards, 12 touchdowns and the one interception, while completing 66 percent of his passes.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s seen every look in the book, and even ones that haven\u2019t been in the book,\u201d Vrabel said of Brady. \u201cAnytime that somebody\u2019s open, they get the football. Anytime you make a mistake, he\u2019s always going to find the guy that you make a mistake on and get them ball really quickly.\u201d\n\nMORE BRADY\n\nThe three-time MVP will play his 300th game, including the postseason, Sunday. Brady will join Brett Favre as the only quarterbacks to reach that mark, and the Patriots quarterback needs four TD passes to pass Peyton Manning (579) for most TD passes in NFL history for regular season and postseason combined. The Titans, the NFL\u2019s top scoring defense and also best in the red zone, are allowing only 17.6 points per game and have allowed three TDs in a game only twice this season.\n\nMERRY-GO-ROUND\n\nTennessee has to be ready for an unconventional look in the Patriots\u2019 backfield. With rookie Sony Michel nursing a knee injury the past two weeks, receiver Cordarrelle Patterson has emerged as New England\u2019s go-to threat at running back. Patterson led the Patriots in rushing each of the past two games, including 61 yards and a 5-yard touchdown last week.\n\nBoth Michel (knee) and Patterson (neck) started this week limited in practice.

(AP) \u2014 Conservationists and outdoors enthusiasts hope Democratic Gov.-elect Tony Evers will re-energize Wisconsin\u2019s Department of Natural Resources after years of cuts under Republican Scott Walker, counting on him to return the agency to a science-based footing and get tougher on polluters and chronic wasting disease.\n\nEvers will have broad authority to make sweeping changes at the department after he takes office in January, starting with appointing a new secretary and replacing the executive staff. He\u2019ll be able to propose even more substantive changes in his 2019-21 executive budget, including more money for the agency and restoring axed positions.\n\n\u2033(An Evers administration) will significantly change how the current conservation and environmental laws are implemented and enforced,\u201d George Meyer, executive director of the Wisconsin Wildlife Federation and a former DNR secretary under Gov. Tommy Thompson. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see morale immediately go up among staff that were uncomfortable with some of the positions taken by DNR over the last eight years. DNR staff right now just keep their heads down.\u201d\n\nRepublicans have long vilified the department as an impediment to business expansion. Walker and GOP lawmakers transformed the agency over his eight years in office.\n\nWalker\u2019s four budgets drained nearly $90 million from the department, cut nearly 250 positions, including half of the agency\u2019s science researchers, scaled back land purchases and cut support for state parks, leaving them to survive on user fees.\n\nUnder Walker\u2019s leadership, the agency scrubbed language from its website stating human activities are causing climate change. State auditors in 2016 discovered the department wasn\u2019t following its own policies for policing pollution from factory farms.\n\nWalker signed bills easing regulations for iron and allowing sulfide mining, sending environmentalists into an outrage. DNR officials also have decided to follow Republican Attorney General Brad Schimel\u2019s legal opinion that they lack the authority to consider high-capacity wells impact on nearby waters, leading to criticism that the wells are sucking lakes and streams dry.\n\nWalker also took a hands-off approach to chronic wasting disease, bowing to deer hunters upset with the DNR\u2019s goal of thinning the state herd to slow the disease\u2019s spread.\n\nEvers\u2019 agenda for the department is unclear. Campaign spokesman Sam Lau didn\u2019t immediately reply to an email seeking details. Evers said during the campaign that he wants to re-inject science into the agency and review air permits for Foxconn Technology Group\u2019s massive flat-screen plant under construction in Mount Pleasant, but he didn\u2019t emphasize environmental and outdoor issues.\n\nHis website talks vaguely about plans to replace lead pipes, creating new outdoor opportunities and supporting the Paris climate change accords but offers few details.\n\nNick Novak, a spokesman for Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce, the state\u2019s largest business group and a powerful advocate for business expansion, declined to comment on the ramifications of an Evers administration. A message left with the Wisconsin Farm Bureau Federation, which advocates for factory farms, wasn\u2019t immediately returned.\n\nConservationists have their wish lists, though.\n\nLarry Bonde, chairman of the Conservation Congress, a group of sportsmen who advise the DNR on policy, said he hopes Evers\u2019 DNR will consider raising hunting and fishing fees, which haven\u2019t increased in years even though the agency needs more revenue. He\u2019d also like to see Evers ban baiting and feeding deer in hopes of slowing CWD and allow department experts to testify about bills after largely remaining silent during Walker\u2019s tenure.\n\nClean Wisconsin lobbyist Amber Meyer Smith said she wants Evers to focus on reducing groundwater contamination, address climate change and promote clean energy sources.\n\nMeyers predicted Evers will appoint DNR executives with natural resource management experience, ramp up education about CWD and call for testing more deer for the disease.\n\nThe new governor also will likely renew the DNR\u2019s land stewardship program and push the department to stiffen pollution permit requirements, Meyers said. He also expects Evers will block any Republican bills relaxing environmental regulations while clamping down on polluters, especially with Democrat Josh Kaul backing him up as the state\u2019s new attorney general.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to see the science of air, water, environmental quality come back to the agency,\u201d former Democratic Gov.

(AP) \u2014 A Senate committee on Thursday approved a bipartisan recommendation for an outside investigation into a rape allegation made against state Sen. Joe Fain.\n\nThe chamber\u2019s Facilities and Operations Committee unanimously approved the decision, which imposed a report deadline of Dec. 31, though officials said they would like it by Dec. 14 if possible.\n\nSenate leaders said they may re-evaluate their decision if the Auburn Republican loses his election in the coming days. After vote tallies in King County were updated Thursday afternoon, Fain was trailing his Democratic opponent, Mona Das, by 206 votes. More votes will be posted Friday afternoon. A recount in the race will be triggered if the final tally is less than one half of one percent and also less than 2,000 votes.\n\nIn September, Seattle resident Candace Faber tweeted that Fain raped her in 2007, on the night she graduated from Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. Fain, who has denied the allegation, was not in office at the time at the time of the alleged assault. Faber said she was inspired to publicly speak out as she watched the televised allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nIn an email, Faber said she was glad to hear that the Senate was taking steps to investigate, but she said that regardless of whether or not Fain is re-elected, \u201cthis experience has made it clear that we do not have an adequate process for dealing with sexual abusers of any form outside of a criminal or workplace situation.\u201d\n\nIn a joint statement issued after the vote, Democratic Majority Leader Sharon Nelson and Senate Republican Leader Mark Schoesler said the chamber struggled with how to respond, since the allegation pre-dated Fain\u2019s time in the Legislature.\n\n\u201cWe feel that the hiring of an independent third party provides the most potential for a fair, non-partisan and comprehensive outcome that is satisfactory to everyone involved,\u201d they wrote.\n\nFain, 37, was first elected to the Washington state Senate in 2010, three years after the alleged incident. He is currently the state Senate minority floor leader.\n\n\u201cWhile this episode has caused incredible stress and pain for my family, I have repeatedly sought a fair and respectful process that will allow me to clear my name and move on,\u201d Fain said in a text message Thursday.\n\nTwo other lawmakers seeking re-election this year have also had to address sexual misconduct charges. Democratic Rep. David Sawyer lost his August primary less than two months after an outside investigation found that he violated the chamber\u2019s policies on harassment, decorum and ethics. Among the findings in the investigation were that Sawyer sent a House employee \u201cinappropriate and offensive\u201d text messages over a period of three months.\n\nRepublican leaders in the House called for Rep. Matt Manweller to resign after The Northwest News Network reported in September that a former Idaho high school student of Manweller\u2019s said she had a sexual relationship with him in the 1990s, when she was 17. Manweller, who was fired from his professor position at Central Washington University in August following an outside investigation into alleged inappropriate conduct, has denied the allegations but has said he will finish his term but not serve another if re-elected. Manweller comfortably won his district with 64 percent of the vote, and confirmed in a text message Thursday that he will serve out the reminder of his term, which ends Jan. 13.

(AP) \u2014 The mayor of New Jersey\u2019s largest city denounced comparisons Thursday between high lead levels affecting as many as 18,000 residences and the recent crisis in Flint, Michigan, as the city faces a long and costly cleanup and replacement effort.\n\nNewark Mayor Ras Baraka said his administration is taking multiple steps to address the high levels caused by aging lead service lines that serve private residences, some of which are more than 100 years old.\n\nBetween 15,000 and 18,000 homes are estimated to have the lead lines. Newark has about 280,000 residents.\n\nNewark\u2019s current plight dates back to a 2016 finding that lead had tainted water in city schools. Since then, the city has been found on three separate occasions to have elevated lead levels in its residential water supply.\n\nBaraka said the city has complied with directives from the state Department of Environmental Protection and the federal Environmental Protection Agency at each step and has taken additional steps, including giving out 20,000 free water filters to residents this summer.\n\nThe problems drew additional attention in June when the National Resources Defense Council and an association of city educators claimed in a federal lawsuit that the city hadn\u2019t been adequately monitoring and testing a water system that contained what it termed \u201cdangerously high\u201d lead levels.\n\nThe publicity generated by the suit spurred comparisons to Flint, where water was found to have elevated lead levels in 2014 and 2015 despite officials\u2019 insistence the water was safe.\n\nSome state health officials in Michigan have been charged criminally in connection with an outbreak of Legionnaires\u2019 disease in the Flint area that some experts believe resulted from poorly treated water.\n\nBaraka called the comparisons \u201cB.S.\u201d and \u201ca lie.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know it sounds sexy and it\u2019s something you can put on the front page, but that\u2019s not what happened here,\u201d he said Thursday. \u201cIn Flint they purposely did not put a corrosion control inhibitor in their water. Ours stopped working. That\u2019s a marked and clear difference.\n\n\u201cWhat they did was purposeful and deliberate, to save money,\u201d he added. \u201cOur corrosion control inhibitor stopped working; we found out it stopped working and we did something about it.\u201d\n\nReplacing the lead service lines is expected to cost roughly $70 million and take several years, and is complicated by questions over how much, if anything, residents should be forced to pay since the lines are the property of the homeowners. Baraka estimated the total cost at roughly several thousand dollars per home.\n\nThat prospect wasn\u2019t sitting well with homeowner Deborah Stokes, who called the water quality in her home \u201cdisgusting,\u201d\n\n\u201cWe pay taxes here,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy should we have to pay more?

Also pictured, from left, are quarterback Lamar Jackson, quarterbacks coach James Urban and quarterback Josh Woodrum.

(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky, File)\n\nBALTIMORE (AP) \u2014 Having worked in unison for 11 seasons with the Baltimore Ravens, John Harbaugh and Joe Flacco are under pressure to extend their extraordinary bond to an even dozen years.\n\nThe emergence of first-round draft pick Lamar Jackson and a three-game losing streak have raised questions about the future of a coach and quarterback who reached the postseason in each of their first five seasons together and capped the run with a Super Bowl victory.\n\nRecently, however, the Ravens have stumbled. They\u2019ve missed the postseason for three consecutive years and entered their bye week with a 4-5 record.\n\nGeneral manager Ozzie Newsome will step down after this season, and Baltimore\u2019s performance over the last seven games could go a long way toward determining if the transition will extend to a change at head coach and/or quarterback.\n\nFollowing a lackluster 2017 season that could be attributed in part to a slow-healing back injury, Flacco has been solid this year. He\u2019s thrown for 2,465 yards and has 12 touchdown passes with only six interceptions.\n\nThough Harbaugh has allowed the fleet-footed and elusive Jackson to receive several snaps each game, he\u2019s not about to make a quarterback change at this pivotal point in the season.\n\n\u201cJoe has played well, so I don\u2019t want to get into all of that,\u201d Harbaugh said. \u201cWe\u2019re rolling right now with what we have.\u201d\n\nHarbaugh took the job as Ravens coach in 2008 with Flacco as a rookie quarterback. Flacco started the opener, the first of his 163 regular-season games under Harbaugh \u2014 second-most in NFL history by a quarterback who\u2019s spent his entire career with the same head coach. Only Tom Brady and Bill Belichick have more (260).\n\nBut the Ravens didn\u2019t trade up to get Jackson just to keep the 2016 Heisman Trophy winner on the sideline. The former Louisville star ranks second on the team with 139 yards rushing and has completed seven of 12 passes, most of them during mop-up duty.\n\nThe challenge for Harbaugh is to determine when, and how often, to use the rookie. It\u2019s a tricky problem, in part because the Ravens often keep Flacco in the game when Jackson enters so the defense won\u2019t know who will take the snap when the huddle breaks. If Jackson is the quarterback, then Flacco lines up as a receiver who almost certainly won\u2019t be a target.\n\n\u201cI sure hope not,\u201d Flacco said with a grin.\n\nJackson ran for 4,132 yards and 50 touchdowns at Louisville. He\u2019s far more of a threat with his legs than the 33-year-old Flacco, leaving the opposition to guess whether Jackson will keep the ball, hand it off or pass.\n\n\u201cThe stats say we\u2019re over twice as effective running the ball with Lamar on the field. That\u2019s even with the 10-man football that people say we\u2019re playing,\u201d Harbaugh said. \u201cThe numbers don\u2019t lie there. That\u2019s probably why I say I\u2019d like to get him on the field more, because you always want to do things that are effective more.\u201d\n\nThough unyieldingly loyal to Flacco, Harbaugh didn\u2019t dismiss the possibility of using Jackson for an entire series.\n\n\u201cI would say that\u2019s an option, yes,\u201d Harbaugh said.\n\nThe strange thing about all this is that the Ravens have not made use of another quarterback who has started in 41 NFL games, including the playoffs. Retained as part of the 53-man roster in case Flacco or Jackson gets hurt, Robert Griffin III has been inactive every game this season.\n\nWhether Griffin gets to play remains to be seen. For now, the Ravens are focused on finding the right mix between Flacco and Jackson.\n\nJackson enjoys contributing, though he would prefer better results.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very cool, but I feel like I need to do more,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to score more points. I\u2019ve got to help my team move the ball.\u201d\n\nThe Ravens planned to use the bye week to rest and get healthy. Starting tackles James Hurst (back) and Ronnie Stanley (ankle) missed a 23-16 loss to Pittsburgh last Sunday, and it\u2019s essential that Baltimore have a full offensive line against Cincinnati at home next week.\n\nThe defense has to get better, too. After getting 11 sacks in a 21-0 rout of Tennessee on Oct. 14, the Ravens have yielded 83 points during a skid that has put their postseason chances in jeopardy.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not eliminated yet. We\u2019re in a hole, and now we have to dig ourselves out,\u201d safety Eric Weddle said. \u201cWe just have to get our minds refreshed and refocused, then come back and get after it.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "1 of 3 Clemson quarterback Trevor Lawrence scrambles out of the pocket during the first half of an NCAA college football game against Louisville, Saturday, Nov. 3, 2018, in Clemson, S.C.

Eccles Federal Reserve Board Building in Washington. On Thursday, Nov. 8, the Federal Reserve releases its latest monetary policy statement after a two-day meeting. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin, File)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Federal Reserve has left its key policy rate unchanged but signaled that it plans to keep responding to the strong U.S. economy with more interest rate hikes. The next rate increase is expected in December.\n\nThe Fed kept its benchmark rate in a range of 2 percent to 2.25 percent. A statement it issued Thursday after its latest policy meeting portrayed the economy as robust, with healthy job growth, low unemployment, solid consumer spending and inflation near the Fed\u2019s 2 percent target.\n\nDespite a U.S. trade war with key nations, weaker corporate investment and a sluggish housing market, the Fed is showing confidence in the economy\u2019s resilience. To help control inflation, it has projected three rate increases in 2019 after an expected fourth hike of the year next month.\n\nAnalysts saw the central bank\u2019s decision to highlight the economy\u2019s strength and to make few changes in its policy statement as a sign that it remains on track to raise rates next month.\n\n\u201cThe Fed\u2019s economic assessment remains very upbeat, noting declining unemployment and continued strong growth,\u201d said Greg McBride, Bankrate.com\u2019s chief financial analyst. \u201cAll signs point to a rate hike at the December meeting.\u201d\n\nThe Fed\u2019s decision Thursday was approved 9-0 by its voting policymakers. Its brief statement was nearly identical to the one the Fed issued in September. It said the job market has continued to strengthen and noted that economic activity has been rising \u201cat a strong rate.\u201d\n\nIn one of its few changes, the Fed downgraded its assessment of business investment spending, observing that it had slowed from its pace earlier in the year.\n\nThe Fed did not specify any risks to the economy it perceives. Analysts will be studying the minutes of this week\u2019s meeting, to be released in three weeks, for any insight into economic threats Fed policymakers may see, such as the trade war between the United States and China.\n\nIn deciding how fast or slowly to keep raising rates, the Fed will be monitoring the pace of growth, the job market\u2019s strength and gauges of inflation for clues to how the economy may evolve in the coming months. The brisk pace of economic growth \u2014 a 3.5 percent annual rate in the July-September quarter, after a 4.2 percent rate in the previous quarter \u2014 has raised the risk that inflation could begin accelerating.\n\nSome economists foresee only two Fed rate hikes next year. Others expect that economic growth will remain solid and the job market strong and that the Fed will decide that four rate increases will be justified next year to guard against high inflation. At 3.7 percent, the unemployment rate is already at its lowest level since 1969.\n\nLast week, the government reported that the economy added a sizable 250,000 jobs in October and that average pay rose 3.1 percent over the previous 12 months \u2014 the sharpest year-over-year gain in nearly a decade. That\u2019s welcome news for workers. But it\u2019s a trend that may raise concern that accelerating wages will help fuel undesirably high inflation.\n\nChairman Jerome Powell has stressed that the Fed is determined to follow a middle-of-the-road approach: Keep gradually nudging up rates to control inflation but avoid tightening too aggressively and perhaps triggering a recession.\n\nEven after three increases this year, the Fed\u2019s benchmark rate is still low by historical standards. The central bank\u2019s policymakers have stressed, and most economists agree, that these small quarter-point increases amount to a gradual pace of credit tightening.\n\nStill, the Fed\u2019s benchmark rate affects many consumer and business loans, including mortgages and credit cards, and when it raises it, borrowing can become more expensive for many. Savers, though, typically earn more on their cash deposits as interest rates rise.\n\nSince the stock market started tumbling last month, President Donald Trump has attacked the Fed\u2019s rate hikes as well as Powell\u2019s leadership. Trump\u2019s public criticism has aroused concern that he is intruding on the central bank\u2019s long-respected political independence and its need to operate free of outside pressure.\n\nAt the same time, the nervousness among stock investors reflects the reality that the Fed\u2019s steady march toward higher rates is removing a key factor that has underpinned the bull market in stocks: The richer returns that investors could achieve in stocks than in bonds or savings accounts.\n\nFed critics had charged that the central bank was creating a bubble in stocks that would eventually pop with disastrous results. Trump, who has often invoked high stock prices as evidence that his economic policies are succeeding, has made clear his disagreement. He has called the Fed, with its string of rate increases, \u201cmy biggest threat.\u201d\n\nPowell, who was Trump\u2019s hand-picked choice to lead the Fed, has avoided responding directly. The chairman has instead expressed determination to pursue the Fed\u2019s mandate of maximizing employment and stabilizing prices without regard to political considerations.\n\nThe Fed is edging closer to what it sees as the \u201cneutral\u201d level. This is the point at which the Fed\u2019s key rate is thought to neither stimulate the economy nor restrain it.\n\nThe median assessment of Fed officials has pegged the neutral rate at 3 percent. One more rate increase this year and two more in 2019 would leave the Fed\u2019s benchmark rate at a range of 2.75 percent to 3 percent.", "California bar gunman went from a Marine to living with mom\n\nTHOUSAND OAKS, Calif. (AP) \u2014 Ian David Long began his adult life by enlisting in the Marines and getting married. Years after a divorce and a discharge and months after shouting brought a mental health expert to his door, Long killed 12 people at a country music bar outside Los Angeles.\n\nLong, 28, was a former military machine gunner who apparently killed himself after the Wednesday night attack in Thousand Oaks, the quiet suburb where he lived with his mother.\n\nNeighbors said Thursday they would hear loud, aggressive fights between the two. Authorities said they visited that ranch-style house only once, in April, after a neighbor reported yelling and crashing sounds.\n\nDeputies found Long \u201cwas somewhat irate, acting a little irrationally\u201d and called in a mental health specialist, Ventura County Sheriff Geoff Dean said. That specialist assessed Long but concluded he couldn\u2019t be involuntarily committed for psychiatric observation.\n\n\u201cThe mental health experts out there cleared him that day,\u201d Dean told reporters Thursday, though they were concerned he might be suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder because of his military service.\n\n\u201cObviously he had something going on in his head that would cause him to do something like this,\u201d Dean said.\n\nAuthorities hope a search of a gunman's home will provide information about the motive for a shooting that killed 12 people at a Southern California bar. (Nov. 8)\n\nA next-door neighbor said he called authorities about six months ago when he heard loud banging and shouting at Long\u2019s home.\n\n\u201cI was concerned because I knew he had been in the military,\u201d neighbor Tom Hanson said Thursday, as federal and local law enforcement officers searched Long\u2019s house, where an American flag flew over the garage.\n\nHanson described Long as an introvert and said he was \u201cdumbfounded\u201d by the massacre.\n\nLong\u2019s only other contact with authorities came after a traffic collision and after he alleged he was the victim of a violent encounter in 2015 at another bar in Thousand Oaks, the sheriff said.\n\nLong enlisted in the Marines at 18 and was married as a 19-year-old in Honolulu in June 2009, according to military and court records.\n\nHis military service lasted nearly five years, and he was honorably discharged with the rank of corporal in 2013, the Pentagon said. He was part of the infantry, responsible for hauling and shooting machine guns.\n\nDuring his service, Long\u2019s marriage fell apart. He and his wife separated in June 2011, while he was deployed on a seven-month tour in Afghanistan. The couple cited irreconcilable differences in divorce papers filed in May 2013, two months after Long left the Marines.\n\nLater, he enrolled at nearby California State University, Northridge, last attending in 2016, the school said in a statement.\n\nMore recently he was living in a home where neighbors said they could hear frequent, aggressive shouting between Long and his mother, especially over the last year.\n\nAbout 18 months ago, Don and Effie MacLeod heard \u201can awful argument\u201d and what he believes was a gunshot from the Longs\u2019 property. Don MacLeod said he did not call police but avoided speaking with Ian Long.\n\n\u201cI told my wife, \u2018Just be polite to him. If he talks, just acknowledge him, don\u2019t go into conversation with him,\u2019\u201d Don MacLeod said Thursday.\n\nSparse pictures on social media showed a happy Long family. His mother, Colleen, posted Facebook photos of her son in his military uniform in 2010 and 2011.\n\n\u201cMy Son is home, well sort of, back in Hawaii, soon to be in Cali come January, hooray!\u201d she wrote on Dec. 14, 2012.\n\nAnother photo from 2014 shows Ian Long with his arm draped around his mother in front of Dodger Stadium. The two were wearing Dodgers T-shirts and smiles.\n\nAuthorities haven\u2019t identified what motivated Long to open fire during college night at Borderline Bar & Grill in Thousand Oaks, around 40 miles (64 kilometers) from downtown Los Angeles. The city of about 130,000 people is consistently near the top of lists ranking the safest places in California.\n\nThe dead included 11 people inside the bar and a veteran sheriff\u2019s sergeant who was the first officer through the door.\n\nThe Marine Corps said Long earned several awards, including a Combat Action Ribbon and a Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal. He was assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment, Third Marine Division in Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii.\n\n___\n\nPritchard reported from Los Angeles.

Meng became the organization\u2019s president in November 2016.\n\nChinese authorities said they detained Meng, 64, on bribery charges, though his wife has described him as a victim of political persecution. He was China\u2019s vice minister of public security and appears to be the latest ranking Chinese official to have been caught in a sweeping purge under President Xi Jinping.\n\nStock said his organization learned of Meng\u2019s disappearance on Oct. 5 via media reports that came out after Meng\u2019s wife said she had not heard from him since the end of September and reported him missing.\n\nInterpol contacted Beijing, asking for clarification, according to Stock. A high-level Chinese delegation arrived at Interpol\u2019s Lyon headquarters on Oct. 7, reported that Meng had written a resignation letter and advised that he was no longer a delegate from China to Interpol \u2014 meaning he could no longer serve as president.\n\nChina\u2019s Interpol office transmitted the resignation letter to Interpol headquarters later that day.

Interpol databases are queried 200 times each second by police around the world, he said.\n\n\u201cWe are a rules-based organization. That is very important to understand,\u201d Stock said, adding that the role of Interpol is \u201cnot to govern over member states.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are not an investigative body,\u201d he said.\n\nStock said he is in \u201cconstant\u201d contact with the national central bureau in Beijing that serves as Interpol\u2019s point of contact in China. As secretary general, Stock manages Interpol\u2019s day-to-day activities, while the agency\u2019s elected president has a less hands-on, more symbolic role.\n\n\u201cWe are strongly encouraging China\u201d to come forth with details of Meng\u2019s case, Stock said.

(AP Photo/Ron Schwane)\n\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) \u2014 Patrick Mahomes had been shredding the Patriots defense all night with his incredible arm strength and downfield precision in a back-and-forth shootout last month when it looked as if the Chiefs quarterback might be finally corralled by a well-timed blitz.\n\nWith a deft flip of his wrist, Mahomes instead tossed a soft screen pass to Kareem Hunt out of the backfield, and he raced up the field as the Patriots were forced to chase him.\n\nThe timing was perfect. The execution was spot-on.\n\nIt was just one of dozens of examples through the first nine games this season of coach Andy Reid using the screen pass to impressive effect.\n\nWhether it\u2019s Hunt out of the backfield, Tyreek Hill or Sammy Watkins on a bubble screen or even tight end Travis Kelce catching a short pass behind the defense, the Chiefs may use their myriad variations of the screen better than any other team.\n\n\u201cYou are really just taking a blocking scheme and moving it out into space,\u201d Reid explained. \u201cOur backs are good with it, quarterback gives them an opportunity and the big guys get out and run.\u201d\n\nThe intricate timing plays are fun for just about everybody.\n\nMahomes likes them because the throws are fairly easy and often lead to big gains. Hunt and fellow running back Spencer Ware like them because they can use their talent in space. And even the offensive linemen like them because they often get to plow through smaller defensive backs, rather than tangle with big defensive tackles as they would do on a traditional running play.\n\nOh, and the Chiefs\u2019 fans like them for obvious reasons.\n\nScreen passes are hardly new in the NFL, and indeed, they have been part of Reid\u2019s basic West Coast offense since he was learning the scheme from its originator, Bill Walsh.\n\nBut with so many playmakers at his disposal, and a quarterback who is finally capable of executing the variety of plays, Reid has taken the old-school notion of screen passes to another level.\n\nThey might incorporate elements of the run-pass option, a relatively new development that has swept through the NFL.\n\nOr they might call for guys to line up in unique spots, such as running backs split wide or a wide receiver in the backfield. Or they might call for exotic blocking schemes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a timing thing. We have to be in sync with our offensive line,\u201d Ware said. \u201cOur releases are a big part of it \u2014 how we escape. The downfield ball with Tyreek, Sammy, Travis and Mahomes throwing it opens it up for us. Then when you have Kareem running how he\u2019s running, they come up and play the run and it\u2019s like, \u2018No, it\u2019s not a run, it\u2019s a pass. You\u2019d better get back.\u2019 That gives us some cushion.\u201d\n\nSuch screen plays often look simple, but are in fact quite difficult to execute.\n\nMahomes has to read the defense correctly in the seconds before a snap. The designated target needs to be on the same page. And as Hunt explained, \u201cthere\u2019s just a lot of timing involved.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Mahomes added, \u201cbut with how well Coach Reid explains it, everything goes off each other. I think we had a screen and it went off a shovel pass to Kareem the week before, things like that, where we build on top of each other every single week. We are never set in our ways.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s another reason the Chiefs\u2019 screen passes are so difficult to defend: They may run a play to one target one week, giving the next opponent film to review, then run the play to a different target out of the exact same formation the following week.\n\nGood luck trying to stop that.\n\n\u201cAsking these guys to go against faster players, for your offensive linemen to go against these defensive backs and block them in space, that\u2019s tough to do,\u201d Reid said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re fortunate our backs do a nice job of this. They help set up the defense so you can run fast. There\u2019s nothing worse than watching a screen, you get out there and the offensive linemen are out there trying to dance a little bit.\n\n\u201cA back can take care of you with that,\u201d Reid concluded. \u201cAs long as you know where he\u2019s at, he\u2019s going to kind of force the issue downhill, good things can happen.\u201d\n\nNotes: Strong safety Eric Berry (heel), OL Cam Erving (illness), LB Anthony Hitchens (ribs), WR Sammy Watkins (foot) and C Mitch Morse (concussion) remained out of practice Thursday. ... Special teams coach Dave Toub dismissed a couple of recent missed PATs, saying Thursday that \u201cnobody is harder on himself\u201d than PK Harrison Butker.

(AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes, File)\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 A U.S. appeals court blocked President Donald Trump on Thursday from immediately ending an Obama-era program shielding young immigrants from deportation, saying the administration\u2019s decision was based on a flawed legal theory.\n\nA three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously kept a preliminary injunction in place against Trump\u2019s decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.\n\nLawsuits by California and others challenging the administration\u2019s decision will continue in federal court while the injunction stands.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court could eventually decide the fate of DACA, which has protected about 700,000 people who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children or came with families that overstayed visas. Earlier this week, the Trump administration took the unusual step of asking the Supreme Court to take up the case even before any federal appeals courts had weighed in. It was the second time the administration sought review of its DACA decision by the Supreme Court.\n\nIn Thursday\u2019s ruling, 9th Circuit Judge Kim Wardlaw said California and other plaintiffs were likely to succeed with their claim that the decision to end DACA was arbitrary and capricious.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security moved to end the program last year on the advice of just-fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who determined DACA to be unlawful because, he said, President Barack Obama did not have the authority to adopt it in the first place.\n\nThat was incorrect, Wardlaw wrote, noting that the federal government has a long and well-established history of using its discretion not to enforce immigration law against certain categories of people. Examples include President Dwight D. Eisenhower\u2019s decision in 1956 to extend \u201cimmigration parole\u201d to 30,000 Hungarian refugees otherwise unable to remain in the U.S. and President Ronald Reagan\u2019s \u201cFamily Fairness\u201d program, which allowed certain relatives of illegal immigrants who had been granted amnesty to likewise remain in the country.\n\nWhile the federal government might be able to end DACA for policy reasons under its own discretion, it can\u2019t do so based on Sessions\u2019 faulty belief that the program exceeds federal authority, the court held.\n\n\u201cWe hold only that here, where the Executive did not make a discretionary choice to end DACA \u2014 but rather acted based on an erroneous view of what the law required \u2014 the rescission was arbitrary and capricious,\u201d Wardlaw wrote. \u201cThe government is, as always, free to reexamine its policy choices, so long as doing so does not violate an injunction or any freestanding statutory or constitutional protection.\u201d\n\nThat said, the judges also declined to dismiss claims that the government\u2019s action might violate the constitutional rights of DACA recipients. The disproportionate effect the decision would have on Latinos might be unconstitutionally discriminatory, the court said, and the plaintiffs had also made a credible claim that it would violate due process for the government to turn around and use information they provided when they enrolled in DACA in deportation proceedings.\n\nThe Trump administration has said it moved to end the program last year because Texas and other states threatened to sue, raising the prospect of a chaotic end to DACA. The administration cited a 2015 ruling by another U.S. appeals court that blocked a separate immigration policy implemented by Obama.\n\nThe 9th Circuit disagreed with the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and said one of its conclusions did not apply to DACA.\n\nAn email to the U.S. Department of Justice was not immediately returned.\n\nTrump\u2019s decision to end DACA prompted lawsuits across the nation, including one by California. A judge overseeing that lawsuit and four others ruled against the administration and reinstated the program in January.\n\nU.S. District Judge William Alsup rejected the argument that Obama had exceeded his power in creating DACA and said the Trump administration failed to consider the disruption that ending the program would cause.\n\nThe administration then asked the 9th Circuit to throw out Alsup\u2019s ruling.\n\nDuring a hearing in May, Deputy Assistant Attorney General Hashim Mooppan argued that the courts could not review the administration\u2019s decision to end DACA. The 9th Circuit rejected that notion.\n\nThe administration has been critical of the 9th Circuit and took the unusual step of trying to sidestep it and have the California DACA cases heard directly by the U.S. Supreme Court. The high court in February declined to do so. It again asked the Supreme Court on Monday to take up the case after warning that it would seek review by the high court if the 9th Circuit did not issue a ruling by Oct. 31.\n\nFederal judges in New York and Washington also have ruled against Trump on DACA.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Gene Johnson contributed from Seattle.", "FILE - In this Sunday, Nov. 4, 2018, file photo, Seattle Seahawks' Bobby Wagner (54) reacts after breaking up a pass intended for Los Angeles Chargers' Virgil Green during the second half of an NFL football game in Seattle.

But the Chiefs\u2019 guards and center got a few yards downfield several times, causing Denver\u2019s linebackers to instinctively commit to the run \u2014 only to see quarterback Patrick Mahomes pull the ball back from running back Kareem Hunt\u2019s belly and zip it to wide-open tight end Travis Kelce.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the league we\u2019re in,\u201d Joseph said. \u201cThose guys blocking up front don\u2019t know the ball is being thrown. They\u2019re blocking zone, so absolutely it\u2019s an issue. We have to fix this issue in this league, unless it\u2019s going to be college football.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough for the linebackers to play both, and you see it on tape. Todd Davis is having hell trying to fit his gap and chase the guy in the flat. When you see Kelce in the flat over there with no one around him, (Davis is) playing his run gap because the guard and center are four and five yards down the field.\u201d\n\nJoseph added, \u201cThat\u2019s an issue. It\u2019s a leaguewide issue and it\u2019s a Chiefs issue.

I add that on to what I already did in the weight room and running and conditioning. But now I have to be ready for everything in the pass game, as well.\u201d\n\nThe linebackers who are modifying their bodies and games are embracing the challenge.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the NFL,\u201d Titans linebacker Wesley Woodyard said. \u201cThere\u2019s great players at every position.\u201d\n\nIncluding linebacker.\n\n\u201cI love it,\u201d Davis said. \u201cIt\u2019s on us to play well and it\u2019s on us to set the tempo and be great for our team. I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\u201d\n\nMarshall said linebackers ultimately benefit from the ever-increasing challenges brought on by the RPO trend, faster rushers, bigger tight ends and plucky receivers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s made me a better player,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cIt\u2019s also made me more valuable.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s why teams put a premium on athletic \u2019backers,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cBecause we have to be out there to cover the Kelces and the Gronks and the Dion Lewises and the James Whites of the world. And then we\u2019ve got to be able to tackle (Todd) Gurley. That\u2019s just how it is.\u201d\n\nDefenses are employing more defensive backs, as many as seven, to combat the RPO trend.\n\n\u201cI think schematically we have to adjust as far as personnel and put faster athletes, better athletes at cover linebacker positions to nullify some of this stuff,\u201d Joseph said. \u201cBecause right now it\u2019s almost impossible physically.\u201d\n\nJoseph thinks he has an antidote in Su\u2019a Cravens, and the 6-foot-1, 220-pound safety from USC who\u2019s used as a dime linebacker certainly agrees.\n\n\u201cThe way the rules are, they handicap defenses. We\u2019re basically on the field to get in the way, we\u2019re not supposed to stop the offense,\u201d Cravens said. \u201cDefense is already hard enough. They\u2019re making it harder.\n\n\u201cSo, with guys like me, I think it\u2019s an opportunity for us to showcase what we can do because they\u2019re making it hard for traditional linebackers who are heavy-handed, heavy-footed. They\u2019re ready to be physical at the line of scrimmage and they can\u2019t do that anymore.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP Pro Football Writers Teresa M.

(AP) \u2014 This wasn\u2019t what North Carolina coach Larry Fedora had envisioned for his seventh season.\n\nThings started badly with 13 players facing suspensions for selling team-issued shoes , which followed Fedora\u2019s much-criticized comments on football\u2019s ties to the degenerative brain disease CTE. Now the one-win Tar Heels are hurtling toward a second straight bowl-less finish and finding ways to lose close games, a stark turn in the program\u2019s direction since winning an Atlantic Coast Conference division championship in 2015.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a fan that sits in the seats or on a message board or anything out there that wants it worse than these kids want it or that are working harder than these kids to make it happen,\u201d Fedora said. \u201cMy job is to put them in a position so that they can do that, and I haven\u2019t done that yet.\u201d\n\nUNC tied a program record with 11 wins in 2015, won the Coastal Division and reached No. 8 in the Top 25. But after an 18-5 stretch with a 13-2 record against league teams, the Tar Heels (1-7, 1-5) have lost 19 of 24 overall and 14 of 16 in the ACC since November 2016 entering Saturday\u2019s trip to rival Duke.\n\nThe list includes a mistake-filled home loss to Virginia Tech after surrendering the winning touchdown with 19 seconds left on a 98-yard drive. There was a double-overtime loss at No. 13 Syracuse. And the Tar Heels rallied from 18 down in the third quarter to tie Georgia Tech in the fourth, only to commit two turnovers that propelled the Yellow Jackets to the win .\n\nThat\u2019s all in the past month, too.\n\nThe problems include shaky quarterback play for the second straight year. There\u2019s another growing list of injuries, including season-ending wrist surgery for sophomore quarterback Chazz Surratt and two freshman QBs who went down during gameday auditions to replace seven-game starter Nathan Elliott. The Tar Heels also rank among the Bowl Subdivision\u2019s worst in turnover margin.\n\nThat\u2019s hampered the staple of Fedora\u2019s tenure: a high-powered offense that provided plenty of cover for mistakes. The Tar Heels averaged 35.9 points and 453.4 yards through his first five seasons, but have slid to 25.1 points and 384 yards over 2017 and 2018.\n\n\u201cOur margin for error is so small right now that every mistake that\u2019s made is magnified in everything we do,\u201d Fedora said.\n\nAt least effort hasn\u2019t been a problem, with Fedora noting: \u201cI\u2019ve told them I can\u2019t ask them to work any harder.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think our team has done actually a good job of just moving on to the next week, not losing hope \u2014 just coming out and grinding every single day,\u201d offensive tackle Charlie Heck said.\n\nDuke coach David Cutcliffe said his team knows to expect a tough game regardless of UNC\u2019s record.\n\n\u201cWatching tape of this team and previous North Carolina teams, this is a well, well-coached football team, a talented football team that\u2019s had some misfortune,\u201d Cutcliffe said. \u201cBut on tape they\u2019re a good football team.\u201d\n\nIt was in this game two years ago that UNC\u2019s slide began, even if then it seemed like merely one bad night.\n\nLed by No. 2 overall NFL draft pick Mitch Trubisky at quarterback, the 15th-ranked Tar Heels went to Durham to face the winless-in-the-ACC Blue Devils. Yet UNC\u2019s offense sputtered after halftime \u2014 foreshadowing current problems \u2014 in the 28-27 loss .\n\nFedora has pointed to turnovers as the slide\u2019s top cause, though there are several factors.\n\nThere has been significant coaching turnover, notably with the departures of strong coordinators when Seth Littrell (offense) left in December 2015 to become North Texas\u2019 head coach and Gene Chizik (defense) leaving coaching in early 2017. Trubisky left a year early after his rapid ascent as a pro prospect, leaving QB questions the Tar Heels have yet to reliably answer.\n\nFedora agreed to a new contract after the 2015 division title. That deal runs through the 2022 season, and a coaching change could cost UNC more than $12 million.\n\nFor now, Fedora is consumed with helping his players find the winning play or two that has eluded them.\n\n\u201cThey know it\u2019s coming \u2014 they do,\u201d Fedora said. \u201cTheir effort has been unbelievable. Their fight, their will to win, all of those things are there. You can see it in their eyes.

Neal cited changes to the top individual rate as an example of what would help the bill pass.\n\nThough Democrats will have a majority in the House, Neal said he was mindful of the reality that Republicans still control the Senate and Trump has a presidential veto.\n\nDuring his own Wednesday press conference, Trump said if Democrats offered an idea for middle-income tax cuts he would work with them, and said, \u201cI would certainly be willing to do a little bit,\u201d when asked if he might consider adjustments to other tax rates.\n\nThe House Ways and Means Committee also has oversight of trade and tariffs, and Neal said his party was prepared to reset the trade agenda by aggressively scrutinizing the renegotiated North American trade deal and back trade talks with the United Kingdom and European Union.\n\nNeal said he expected Trump\u2019s trade deal with Mexico and Canada to come before his committee soon and Democrats, who traditionally support labor unions, will want to ensure that international trade benefits American workers. He said he\u2019s had conversations with United States Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, who he said shares many of his views on how to enforce the treaty.\n\nThe European Union\u2019s stated objective for negotiating a trade deal with the U.S. was also an important consideration, Neal added, as was the potential for a bilateral agreement with the United Kingdom after it leaves the European Union at the end of the process known as Brexit.\n\nNeal said an agreement with the UK should also permanently eliminate the border in Northern Ireland.

Nationwide, the industry says it generates $887 billion a year and is responsible for 7.6 million jobs.\n\nPolis said President Donald Trump is often hostile to protecting public lands and vowed to stand up against what he called bad federal policy.\n\nUtah is suffering because its leaders didn\u2019t resist Trump\u2019s public lands policy, Polis said, an apparent reference to the administration\u2019s decision to shrink Bears Ears National Monument there.\n\nThe outdoor retailers\u2019 summer and winter trade shows moved to Denver from Salt Lake City because of unhappiness with Utah leaders\u2019 position on public lands.\n\nPolis did not discuss any specifics of his plans and left without taking questions. With Democrats headed toward control of both houses of the Legislature, he could have a clear path to enact environment-friendly policies and laws.\n\nThe outdoor retail show\u2019s move from Utah to Colorado was part of the industry\u2019s newfound political activism.\n\nThe Outdoor Industry Association, a trade group affiliated with the show, endorsed a slate of candidates for U.S. Senate, U.S. House and governor for the first time in this year\u2019s midterm elections, and the results were promising, said Alex Boian (BOY\u2019-an), the group\u2019s political director.\n\nThe association endorsed 23 candidates and 20 won, he said.\n\nThe group also made campaign contributions through its political action committee, but the amounts weren\u2019t immediately available.\n\nAsked what impact the endorsements and contributions had, Boian said, \u201cI think in many cases it was significant.\u201d\n\nFifteen of the candidates the group endorsed were Democrats and eight were Republicans.\n\nBoian said the Trump administration\u2019s decision to shrink Bears Ears helped push the association into politics.\n\nOutdoor retailers are also concerned about the escalating U.S. trade war with China, where much outdoor gear is manufactured \u2014 more than 90 percent in some categories, said Rich Harper, the association\u2019s manager for international trade.\n\nHarper said tariffs the U.S. imposed on Chinese-made goods are relatively new and the outdoor industry is still compiling the cost, but he estimated it will be hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nCongress has shown no willingness to challenge the tariffs, so the industry does not expect much help from lawmakers, Harper said.

(AP) \u2014 Sioux Falls officials are grappling with well shutdowns as the extent of the city\u2019s water contamination from decades of firefighting foam use remains unclear.\n\nSioux Falls currently has 19 municipal wells sitting dormant in the aftermath of innumerable gallons of toxic firefighting foam that contaminated the grounds of the city airport nearly 50 years ago, the Rapid City Journal reported. Chemicals linked to cancer and other health issues were found to have contaminated 15 municipal wells, including 10 that have concentrations above what the Environmental Protection Agency deems safe.\n\nAbout 28 percent of the city\u2019s water production from the Big Sioux aquifer is shut down.\n\nThe South Dakota Air National Guard and the Sioux Falls Fire Department both used the toxic firefighting foam for many years near the airport, which led to the contamination of the city\u2019s drinking water. But the scope of the issue is still unknown.\n\n\u201cWe really haven\u2019t determined the extent of release yet,\u201d said Capt. Jessica Bak, a public affairs officer with the Air Guard at the Sioux Falls Regional Airport.\n\nIn 2013, the city\u2019s water purification plant found chemicals from firefighting foam, known as per and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), at levels below the EPA\u2019s health advisory level. The level of exposure beneath the EPA\u2019s threshold means there aren\u2019t expected adverse health risks.\n\nThe city responded to the findings by testing all municipal wells to identify the source and shutting down every well where the chemicals were found.\n\nCity engineer Tim Stefanich, who oversees the water system, acknowledged that \u201cthere was a little bit of time between\u201d finding the contamination, determining its source and deciding to shut off wells. But he said that there was minimal fear of an immediate health risk with the low levels of exposure.\n\nThe city tested for PFAS again in 2014 as part of an EPA-mandated water sampling program, but didn\u2019t detect any of the chemicals. The city tested again in 2016, when some low levels were found.\n\nThe city shut off more wells, leading to the 19 wells offline today. Water leaving the city\u2019s purification plant is now sampled monthly, and no water samples have contained the chemicals since 2016.\n\nStefanich and Trent Lubbers, the city\u2019s utilities operation administrator, believe the contaminated water situation is under control.\n\nThe city has been purchasing water from the Lewis and Clark Regional Water system, a nonprofit, wholesale provider of treated water. But Sioux Falls will likely need a more sustainable option.\n\n\u201cThey have the short term kind of covered,\u201d said Mark Meyer, drinking water program administrator for the state\u2019s Department of Environment & Natural Resources. \u201cBut as we march into the future, having 28 percent of their well capacity offline . the future is going to come sooner than later.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Rapid City Journal, http://www.rapidcityjournal.com", "MADISON, Wis.

Tabaddor says the Trump administration\u2019s new pilot program to hold video court hearings for migrant teens instead of having them appear before a judge in person, has been riddled with glitches. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh, File)\n\nThe Trump administration says it is trying to speed up legal proceedings for some of the record 13,000 migrant children in federal custody by using video hearings to stream testimony from detained youths into courtrooms, The Associated Press has learned.\n\nThe problem, some attorneys and judges say, is that technical glitches \u2014 including bad audio, weak connections and pixelated screens \u2014 are actually making it much harder for the teens in shelters to have a fair hearing. It can be challenging for judges to assess children\u2019s credibility without eye-to-eye contact, they say. And it further obscures the cases, which legally are supposed to be public.\n\nBut the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which has custody of the teens, says its unannounced pilot program will save money and allows youths, some of whom are being housed at a cost of more than $775 a night, to appear before a judge more quickly.\n\nThe program for teens, piloted in conjunction with the Justice Department\u2019s Executive Office for Immigration Review, launched several weeks ago. Video teleconferencing already has been widely used in a variety of adult legal proceedings.\n\nSo far, about 30 youths have appeared via videoconferencing before immigration judges in Phoenix and Harlingen, Texas, said Lydia Holt, an ORR spokeswoman. Similar hearings have been conducted in immigration courts in Miami and New York City, said Kathryn Mattingly, an EOIR spokeswoman. The AP learned they also have been scheduled in Los Angeles, Philadelphia, El Paso, Seattle, Tucson and San Francisco.\n\nThis summer, the optics of children in court became an embarrassment to the administration, with critics seizing on the fact that the immigration system requires children \u2014 some still in diapers \u2014 to appear before judges for legal proceedings.\n\nHolt said the administration has recommended 75 more unaccompanied children for video hearings, typically migrants between the ages of 15 and 17 who have been in custody for a longer period of time and want their immigration cases heard swiftly.\n\n\u201cIf at all possible, ORR does not want children to stay longer than necessary in our facilities while waiting for their immigration case to be heard,\u201d she said.\n\nORR shelters are nearly full, mostly with children who immigrated without their parents and have family or friends in the U.S. willing to take them in. But the children can spend months in detention as the government arranges their deportation or release to parents or other sponsors, who are now facing stricter guidelines for vetting in the U.S.\n\nAlmost 60 percent of all migrant children who had their first court date in fiscal year 2017 still did not have lawyers by this August, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse.\n\nIn states where children have been appearing before judges via video, attorneys say the new process hasn\u2019t worked well thus far and risks rolling back due process. Much of the legal representation is pro bono, and organizations can\u2019t afford to have two attorneys at each appearance \u2014 one in the courtroom and another in the shelter.\n\nIn one case, there was no way to transmit court documents remotely, so someone had to drive to the shelter to serve the detained teen with paperwork. Another teen stopped talking and started looking around the room when the video feed coming from the court went blank, confusing the judge trying to evaluate the teen\u2019s credibility.\n\nThe government is asking shelter workers to set up mock hearing rooms, complete with a table for the child and empty tables for the judge and the government attorney.\n\nJudge Ashley Tabaddor, president of the National Association of Immigration Judges, called the video teleconference equipment \u201cvery, very difficult to work with.\u201d\n\nShe said she recently oversaw a video hearing in her Los Angeles courtroom: It took a half-hour to set up the connection, for a proceeding that would have taken five minutes in person.\n\nPhone lines drop, screens get fuzzy and participants have difficulty hearing each other, an issue exacerbated by language interpreters, who often aren\u2019t at both locations.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing that can substitute for an in-person hearing,\u201d Tabaddor said.\n\nIngrid Eagly, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, who has analyzed thousands of cases of detained adult immigrants, found that those who saw judges on a monitor were more likely to be deported than those who appeared in court.\n\nThe reason: During in-person hearings, detainees often better understood their options and sought legal counsel and other relief. Inside the detention centers, immigrants were frustrated with technical problems and felt the proceedings were unfair, so tended to give up, she found.\n\nImmigration courts began using video hearings for adults 25 years ago, a process the federal government considers a \u201cforce multiplier\u201d by saving time and money. It gives the government greater scheduling flexibility and allows judges in other regions to help clear dockets. And they have ramped up dramatically in the past decade.\n\nArchi Pyati, a New York-based attorney for the Tahirih Justice Center, which represents migrant children, said the government\u2019s growing effort to move immigrant children into remote, locked facilities is making it tougher to provide them their legal recourse.\n\nSometimes, clients need to talk about deeply personal trauma, abuse and fear, Pyati said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to talk about that to a screen and not to a human being,\u201d she said.", "Tim Garrison, right, United States Attorney for the Western District of Missouri, speaks during a press conference on Thursday, Nov. 8, 2018 in Springfield, Mo., about the indictments against Kenneth Scott McKee, the captain of a duck boat that sank on Table Rock Lake in July, killing 17 people.

She had sued over the JCN ad, which she claimed was defamatory.\n\nA federal judge last week rejected a request by Goodson to block similar ads and mailers by another group, the Republican State Leadership Committee.", "A vintage car rests among debris as the Camp Fire tears through Paradise, Calif., on Thursday, Nov. 8, 2018.

(AP Photo/Bob Christie)\n\nPHOENIX (AP) \u2014 A judge on Thursday rejected Republican demands to immediately limit vote counts in the razor-close U.S. Senate race in Arizona and has set a hearing on the challenge affecting about 5,600 votes in the state\u2019s most populous county.\n\nJudge Margaret R. Mahoney said it was too soon to require Maricopa and other counties to stop contacting voters to verify signatures on mail ballots. She also declined to order the counties to temporarily separate mail ballots that have been verified by that process after Election Day.\n\nCounty registrars said that would cause chaos and slow the long vote-counting process even more.\n\nMahoney scheduled a hearing Friday and indicated she would rule then.\n\nThe lawsuit came hours before Democrat Kyrsten Sinema jumped into a slight lead over Republican Martha McSally in the midst of the slow vote count. Sinema is ahead by about 9,000 votes out of 1.9 million counted so far. About 400,000 remain to be counted in the race to replace retiring Republican Sen. Jeff Flake.\n\nThe suit alleges that the state\u2019s county recorders don\u2019t follow a uniform standard for allowing voters to address problems with their mail-in ballots, and that Maricopa and Pima counties improperly allow the fixes for up to five days after Election Day. Sinema has gained votes recently from Maricopa, and Pima is a Democratic bastion.\n\nLawyers who filed the suit say they\u2019d be happy if Mahoney decided to order the state\u2019s more rural counties to follow the same procedures, which would have the effect of expanding the vote count.\n\nCurrently, several other counties that lean Republican destroy mail ballots if voters don\u2019t help verify their signatures before polls close on Election Day.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, each vote should be treated the same way,\u201d attorney Bret Johnson said in an interview.\n\nRecorder Adrian Fontes, the official in charge of counting ballots in Maricopa County, home to 60 percent of Arizona voters, said his office would not finish tallying votes for another week.\n\n\u201cWe know there\u2019s urgency out there, but we want to get it right, not quick,\u201d he said.\n\nArizona is notoriously slow at tallying ballots even though about 75 percent of votes are cast by mail. Those ballots must go through a laborious verification process.\n\nIf the signature on the envelope does not match the signature on the voter file, elections officials can contact the voter to try to resolve the discrepancy. Such situations arise, for example, when voters have Parkinson\u2019s disease and can no longer sign as they did in the past.\n\nAt Thursday\u2019s hearing, officials from the state\u2019s 15 counties suggested the lawsuit only involves a fraction of votes. Colleen Connor, deputy Maricopa County attorney, said there were only 5,600 votes in Maricopa that would fall under the lawsuit and that the rates elsewhere also appeared low.\n\nFontes said part of the logjam is due to his office\u2019s computer system dating from the 1980s, when Maricopa was far smaller and only a handful of its residents voted by mail.\n\nHe said the system only allows his office to tally about 75,000 votes a day.\n\nThe two Senate campaigns have long braced for a slow vote count.

(AP Photo/Chris O'Meara)\n\nTALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Florida faced the prospect of recounts in the razor-thin races for governor and U.S. Senate, potentially prolonging the battle over two of this year\u2019s most-closely watched campaigns.\n\nIn the governor\u2019s race, Democrat Andrew Gillum\u2019s campaign said Thursday it\u2019s prepared for a possible recount. He conceded to Republican Ron DeSantis on Tuesday night, though the margin of the race has since tightened. As of Thursday afternoon, DeSantis led Gillum by 0.47 percentage point.\n\nMeanwhile, Democratic incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson has already begun preparing for a potential recount in a race still too close to call against Republican Gov. Rick Scott. Nelson\u2019s lawyer called that race a \u201cjump ball\u201d \u2014 though Scott\u2019s campaign urged Nelson to concede. Scott held a 0.21 percentage lead over Nelson on Thursday afternoon.\n\nThe tight races underscored Florida\u2019s status as a perennial swing state where elections are often decided by the thinnest of margins. Since 2000, when Florida decided the presidency by 537 votes in a contest that took more than five weeks to sort out, the state has seen many close elections, but never so many dead heats in one year.\n\nAnd like 2000, the counting process is becoming contentious.\n\nScott, as outgoing governor, said at a news conference Thursday night that he was asking the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to investigate elections offices in the Democratic strongholds of Palm Beach and Broward counties, questioning whether they were trying to inflate the Democratic vote. Scott\u2019s campaign filed a lawsuit demanding that the Broward County supervisor of elections be ordered to turn over several records detailing the counting and collection of ballots cast.\n\nGretl Plessinger, a spokeswoman for the FDLE, said by phone that the agency would follow up on the governor\u2019s request.\n\nNelson\u2019s campaign released a statement saying Scott\u2019s action appears to be politically motivated and borne out of desperation as he tries to win the Senate contest.\n\nOn Thursday evening, President Donald Trump weighed in with a tweet on the Senate race. Trump tweeted: \u201cLaw Enforcement is looking into another big corruption scandal having to do with Election Fraud in #Broward and Palm Beach. Florida voted for Rick Scott!\u201d\n\nSarah Revell, a spokeswoman for the Florida Department of State, said she didn\u2019t know of any other recount in a governor or Senate race in state history. She was researching the subject Thursday.\n\nUnder Florida law, a recount is mandatory if the winning candidate\u2019s margin is less than 0.5 percentage points when the first unofficial count is verified Saturday by Florida\u2019s secretary of state.\n\nThe Associated Press has called the governor\u2019s race for DeSantis. If Saturday\u2019s count shows DeSantis with a margin narrow enough to trigger a recount, AP will retract its call for DeSantis. It is AP policy not to call a race that is facing a recount.\n\nThe AP has not called a winner in the Senate race.\n\nIn yet a third statewide seat \u2014 the Cabinet position of agriculture commissioner \u2014 the candidates were separated by 483 votes out of more than 8 million cast \u2014 a margin of 0.006 percent.\n\nGillum\u2019s campaign said it\u2019s monitoring the situation with an elections lawyer and readying for a possible state-mandated recount. He hired attorney Barry Richard, who represented President George W. Bush in the 2000 recount.\n\n\u201cOn Tuesday night, the Gillum for Governor campaign operated with the best information available about the number of outstanding ballots left to count. Since that time, it has become clear there are many more uncounted ballots than was originally reported,\u201d the campaign said. \u201cWe are committed to ensuring every single vote in Florida is counted.\u201d\n\nAt an event in Hialeah Gardens, DeSantis declined to discuss prospects for a recount, telling reporters he was \u201cvery proud to be elected.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great honor,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re working really hard on the transition. We\u2019ll let the lawyers do what they got to do. But, we\u2019re good and look forward to serving.\u201d\n\nFlorida was mocked for the way it handled the infamous 2000 recount, especially since there was no uniform process then on how to proceed. That has changed, with the Legislature passing a clear procedure on how a recount should be conducted.\n\n\u201cThis is not like it was in 2000. There\u2019s not a lot of room for strategy,\u201d Richard said.\n\nElections officials in Broward County, where Democrats have a large advantage, were still reviewing ballots Thursday.\n\nBroward Elections Supervisor Brenda Snipes said she didn\u2019t know how many ballots remain to be counted, but all were being processed. She also did not know how many provisional, military and mismarked ballots need to be counted. Her department\u2019s website said ballots cast on Election Day have been counted.\n\nMarc Elias, a lawyer hired by Nelson, said he expects the margin to narrow further.\n\n\u201cThe results of the 2018 Senate election are unknown and I think that you and the elections officials should treat it as such,\u201d Elias told reporters on a conference call. \u201cWe believe that at the end of this process that Senator Nelson is going to be declared the winner.\u201d\n\nScott\u2019s campaign has said Nelson should concede the race rather than push for a recount.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s be clear: When Elias says \u2018win,\u2019 he means \u2018steal.\u2019\u201d The campaign said in a statement. \u201cIt is sad and embarrassing that Bill Nelson would resort to these low tactics after the voters have clearly spoken.\u201d\n\nWhile the Senate and governor races drew national attention, a Florida Cabinet seat also will likely have a statewide recount.\n\nIn the agriculture commissioner race, Democrat Nikki Fried had a 483-vote lead over Republican state Rep. Rep. Matt Caldwell, or a difference of 0.006 percentage points \u2014 well within range of a hand recount.\n\nFlorida counties have until noon Saturday to submit unofficial election results to the Department of State.

The state voted 69 to 31 percent Tuesday, Nov. 6, to pass Amendment 13, which bans the sport beginning on Jan. 1, 2021. (AP Photo/Brynn Anderson, File)\n\nFORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Florida voters decided to phase out greyhound racing in the state by 2021, meaning thousands of dogs will soon need new homes.\n\nThe state voted 69 to 31 percent Tuesday to pass Amendment 13, which bans the sport beginning on Jan. 1, 2021. It is an overwhelming defeat for an industry already in decline, with 50 tracks closing nationally over the past 30 years because of shrinking crowds and accusations that dogs are mistreated.\n\nAdvocates for the ban say many of Florida\u2019s 8,000 racing dogs will now likely be adopted, as usually happens when they leave the sport, though some may be transferred to other states where the sport will remain legal.\n\nFlorida\u2019s 11 dog tracks constitute almost two-thirds of those remaining nationally. When they close, the sport may be too small to survive long term. Two tracks remain in West Virginia and one each in Alabama, Arkansas and Iowa. In Texas, three tracks rotate an annual meet.\n\nCarey Theil, executive director of Grey2K USA, one of the groups pushing for a nationwide ban, called the margin \u201castounding\u201d and said it was one of the largest ever nationally for any animal rights measure. Amendment 13 even got majorities in 10 of the 11 counties where racing is held \u2014 in five of those, support exceeded 70 percent.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a powerful endorsement of our humane values, and a repudiation of an industry that is cruel and inhumane,\u201d Theil said Wednesday. He said the state should provide resources for any workers who lose jobs because of the ban, including retraining.\n\nJim Gartland, executive director of the National Greyhound Association, said he was surprised by the amendment\u2019s passage \u2014 it needed 60 percent, under Florida law. He said hundreds of greyhound breeders and their employees nationally will be hurt by the Florida decision, and accused the amendment\u2019s backers of \u201clying\u201d and giving \u201cmisleading facts and figures\u201d when they said dogs are abused. State records show that, on average, two of the state\u2019s racing dogs die of injury or illness weekly.\n\n\u201cIt makes no sense that people who make their livelihoods from dogs would abuse them,\u201d Gartland said. Abused dogs are slow dogs, he said, and trainers make their living by producing winners. He said it is unclear how many Florida tracks will keep live racing through 2020 and how many will drop the sport sooner.\n\nJack Cory, spokesman for the Florida Greyhound Association, said tracks and trainers will go to the Legislature and, if necessary, to the courts to be compensated for the revenue they will lose.\n\nBackers spent more than $3 million getting the measure adopted \u2014 10 times the amount spent by racing supporters. Almost half the backers\u2019 funding came from a $1.5 million donation by the Doris Day Animal League, a national group founded by the 96-year-old actress.\n\nThe anti-racing movement had support from across the political spectrum, from animal rights groups like People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals to Republican Gov. Rick Scott.\n\nAmendment 13\u2032s opponents included the National Rifle Association\u2019s state affiliate, which thinks the measure\u2019s language saying \u201cthe humane treatment of animals is a fundamental value\u201d of Floridians could be a backdoor way to eventually ban hunting and fishing. The state Supreme Court rejected that argument during the opponents\u2019 failed effort to remove the amendment from the ballot.\n\nFor some tracks, losing live racing might actually increase profits. Under current Florida law, greyhound tracks must offer live racing to operate poker rooms and accept wagers on simulcast horse racing from tracks across the country. Amendment 13 allows them to keep those side businesses without live racing, even if they drop it immediately.\n\nThe amount wagered on greyhound racing in Florida decreased from $1.5 billion in 1992, adjusted for inflation, to just over $200 million in 2017, state records show. After paying bettors, purses and taxes, five tracks reported losses on live greyhound racing last year and the then-12 tracks combined net revenue on live racing was $20 million. That\u2019s about a fifth their poker net.\n\nJim O\u2019Brien, president and CEO of Melbourne Greyhound Park, said his small track near the Kennedy Space Center loses about $250,000 annually on live racing, but he feels loyalty to the trainers who run dogs there. So he said he wants to take a few days to decide whether to run the track\u2019s upcoming meet. The track made $5 million last year on poker.\n\n\u201cWe are probably going to run, but we will see,\u201d he said.", "Syracuse head coach Dino Babers watches the action in the first half of an NCAA college football game against Wake Forest in Charlotte, N.C., Saturday, Nov. 3, 2018. (AP Photo/Chuck Burton)\n\nSyracuse quarterback Eric Dungey has never played in the final home game of a season. At long last he has that chance.\n\nAnd rest assured that when the No. 13 Orange (7-2, 4-2 Atlantic Coast Conference, No. 13 CFP) take the Carrier Dome field on Friday night to face struggling Louisville (2-7, 0-6) the senior star will appreciate the moment.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s going to be an emotional night, definitely, with all that I\u2019ve been through here,\u201d said Dungey, who missed the final three games of each of his first three seasons with injuries. \u201cI\u2019m just thankful for everything. It\u2019s going to be overwhelming with the emotions.\u201d\n\nThe home finale will be emotional for the senior class that helped third-year coach Dino Babers turn the team into a contender similar to the time Donovan McNabb was working his magic in the late 1990s. The Orange are 5-0 in the Carrier Dome this fall and are seeking just their fourth perfect season inside since the facility that opened in 1980.\n\n\u201cI really do hope the fans understand how emotional this game is,\u201d Babers said. \u201cIt\u2019s just one of those things that you\u2019re going to always remember. If they can put that in their hearts and minds, just come out to say goodbye to this senior class that has really put us back on the right road, given us an opportunity to change this program, I mean, my heart would go out to them. I think those young men deserve it.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the final road game of the year for Louisville and embattled coach Bobby Petrino, whose squad has lost six straight and is coming off a 77-16 beat-down at No. 2 Clemson . The Tigers racked up 661 yards offensively, 492 of it on the ground. Now the Cardinals face a team that\u2019s won three straight, is averaging 43 points a game, and is nationally on the rise.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t had a season like this before,\u201d Petrino said. \u201cIt\u2019s a challenge to everybody. It\u2019s difficult to prepare, go out and play hard, not win. It\u2019s hard on our players, hard on our coaches, hard on our families.\u201d\n\nAfter Friday night, the Orange will play No. 3 Notre Dame at Yankee Stadium and No. 17 Boston College on the road, two more opportunities to keep rising and put those tough road losses to Clemson and Pittsburgh behind them.\n\n\u201cThe sky\u2019s the limit to me. There\u2019s no telling what we can accomplish,\u201d senior linebacker Ryan Guthrie said. \u201cThere\u2019s always the what-if conversations, but we\u2019re looking forward. We\u2019ve got a lot to look forward to.\u201d\n\nOther things to know when Louisville visits Syracuse on Friday night:\n\nWARY ORANGE\n\nThe Cardinals are winless on the road, rank 117th in the nation in scoring (21.6), 112th in total offense (344.7 ypg), and 115th in total defense (462.8). They also have won all four meetings against the Orange since joining the ACC.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not taking Louisville lightly,\u201d Dungey said. \u201cPeople are talking about, \u2018Oh, Louisville\u2019s not that great this year.\u2019 I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true at all. They\u2019ve got a lot of great athletes, a lot of experience as well, and I think they\u2019re hungry for a win. We were that team once, where nobody respected us.\u201d\n\nWALK THIS WAY\n\nBabers is feting his seniors with a treat for the second year in a row. After the game, he will take the team into the locker room and five minutes later will bring the seniors back out to mingle with the fans one last time. Babers was hopeful senior DB Tyrone Perkins would make the trip. Perkins has been recovering in North Carolina from a serious leg injury suffered in last week\u2019s win at Wake Forest .\n\nRETURN SPECIALIST\n\nLouisville freshman Hassan Hall has shown flashes of potential at running back but clearly has carved a place returning kicks. He had a 93-yard touchdown at Clemson \u2014 the Cardinals\u2019 first in three years \u2014 and established a school record with 247 return yards and 273 all-purpose. He leads the team with 999 all-purpose yards.\n\nLATE BLOOMER\n\nLouisville sophomore WR Dez Fitzpatrick has 22 receptions for 290 yards and a pair of touchdowns in the past six games. That\u2019s a 13.2-yard average, and he\u2019s second on the team in receiving with 27 catches for 351 yards.\n\nLIKE OLD TIMES\n\nSyracuse\u2019s No. 13 ranking is its highest in the AP poll since the Orange were No. 11 on Sept. 28, 1998. That was McNabb\u2019s final season, and he went out in style in his last home game, rushing for three TDs and throwing for two more in a 66-13 triumph over Miami. McNabb and Dungey are the only QBs in school history to pass for over 8,000 yards and rush for more than 1,000.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Gary Graves in Louisville, Kentucky, contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "In this Tuesday, March 21, 2017 file photo, UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin addresses the media at a news conference in Prague, Czech Republic.

(AP Photo/Andre Penner)\n\nSAO PAULO (AP) \u2014 Two-time Formula 1 champion Fernando Alonso is almost in retirement mode, but doesn\u2019t think it is time to relax just yet.\n\nThe Spanish driver said on Thursday he can score the last points of his 17-year career at the Brazilian Grand Prix on Sunday. The 37-year-old believes the Interlagos circuit is more suited to his McLaren than Abu Dhabi, where the season ends on Nov. 25.\n\nOccupying 10th position in the drivers\u2019 championship with 50 points, Alonso said the expectation of rain on Saturday and Sunday could help him pick up points at the track where he won his titles in 2005 and 2006. He has never won in Sao Paulo, but finished second on three occasions.\n\n\u201cIf we want to score points, this is the chance for us,\u201d said Alonso, who will quit F1 at the end of the campaign. \u201cWe have some uncertain weather for Saturday and Sunday. Maybe that gives us more possibilities.\u201d\n\nAlonso last scored points in September when he finished seventh at the Singapore Grand Prix. That is the only time he has been among the top 10 in the last seven races.\n\nThe McLaren driver scored points in the first five races, but he then had six abandonments and also produced some lackluster performances.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t even have a chance to fight in the last races,\u201d he said.\n\nAlonso added that Interlagos had given him some good memories, and what he called \u201cseveral media moments.\u201d\n\nIn 2015, at the end of a poor season for McLaren, the Spaniard decided to relax after his car broke down during qualifying in Sao Paulo, sitting on a chair at the side of the track and sun-bathing.\n\nOn Thursday, a similar chair filled with signatures was placed next to the paddock area where Alonso spoke to journalists.\n\n\u201cKeep the best F1 moments in mind!,\u201d said a message from \u2018Sebastian\u2019, although it was unclear if it came from Ferrari\u2019s Vettel.\n\n\u201cEnjoy your retirement watching Disney videos,\u201d another message read.\n\nAt the end of that same 2015 Brazil race, Alonso and his then teammate Jenson Button climbed onto the podium.

Boca has won the title six times since the tournament began in 1960, one behind Argentine club Independiente\u2019s South American record of seven titles. River has won it three times.\n\n\u201cBoca and River have raised Argentine soccer where it has never been before,\u201d Boca Juniors coach Guillermo Barros Schelotto said. \u201cRegardless of the outcome in these finals, we\u2019ve put Argentine soccer at the highest level. Today, the whole world is talking about this final.\u201d\n\nThe first leg will be played Saturday at Boca Juniors\u2019 home stadium, an intimidating ground known as \u201cLa Bombonera\u201d or \u201cThe Chocolate Box\u201d for its tightly enclosed shape that looks like boxes stacked on top of each other. The second leg will be on Nov. 24 at River\u2019s Monumental de Nunez Stadium, where Argentina won its first World Cup in 1978.\n\nAs is usual in recent years, visiting fans will not be allowed at either match because of the fear of violence. It\u2019s been that way since 2013 and not even a plea from Argentine President Mauricio Macri, a former Boca president, could change that.\n\nArgentina\u2019s most successful teams originated in the docks of the southern working-class Buenos Aires neighborhood of La Boca and their rivalry dates back to the early 20th century.\n\nBoca was founded by a group of Italian immigrants who chose the blue and yellow club colors after the flag of a Swedish ship that arrived in port. River, with its white shirt and diagonal red stripe, moved to a northern affluent neighborhood during the league\u2019s beginnings. The derby\u2019s gritty play, passionate fans and colorful celebrations was once ranked by British newspaper The Observer in its top spot of the 50 sporting things you must do before you die.\n\nSome of history\u2019s best players have come from Boca and River. Diego Maradona, who captained Argentina to the 1986 World Cup title, spent two stints at Boca and has his VIP seat reserved at the stadium. Playmaker Juan Roman Riquelme and prolific goal scorer Martin Palermo were part of a golden era when the club even beat all-mighty Real Madrid for the Intercontinental Cup in 2000.\n\nRiver Plate takes pride in having produced world-class players like Alfredo Di Stefano, who began his career at the club and went on to win five European Cup titles with Real Madrid. Or Enzo Francescoli, an inspiration for France great Zinedine Zidane, who named one of his children after the Uruguayan forward.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s the first time Boca and River will play each other for the Copa Libertadores title, the teams have met in the South American competition three times previously. Boca won in the 2000 quarterfinals 4-2 on aggregate and in the 2004 semifinals on a penalty shootout. River won the 2015 round-of-16 match in 1-0 after tournament organizers eliminated Boca because of pepper spray spread by its fans in the second leg.\n\n\u201cNo one can erase what has been done,\u201d River coach Marcelo Gallardo said recently. \u201cBut now, it\u2019s a whole new story, one more page in this book. It will be up to us to continue being part of this history.\u201d\n\nRiver is looking for its second Copa Liberatdores title in the last three years, a huge achievement considering the team was relegated to the second division in 2011 \u2014 a painful blow that triggered riots between police and fans.\n\nGallardo, a former River player, has restored River\u2019s pride since taking over in 2014, winning several championships and last year\u2019s Argentine Super Cup against Boca.\n\nOf course, none of that matters to Boca Juniors.\n\n\u201cThis is not one more game in the league. This is a final,\u201d Barros Schelotto said. \u201cThe only thing in my mind is to try to win these two games.\u201d\n\nBoth coaches have plenty to play for. Besides gaining iconic status among the legions of fans for each team, the winning coach also would improve his prospects of taking over Argentina\u2019s national team.\n\nGallardo will be at a bit of a disadvantage, though. He will miss the first match after being sanctioned by South American soccer\u2019s governing body for failing to follow a previous suspension that banned him from contacting his players during the semifinals.\n\nOn the field, Boca\u2019s best-known player is forward Carlos Tevez, who appeared in two World Cups for Argentina and previously played for clubs including Juventus, Manchester United and Manchester City. But these days, the team depends on striker Dario Benedetto, whose goals helped the club reach the final.\n\nRiver striker Gonzalo \u201cPity\u201d Martinez could be the one to watch on the other side. He scored in the last two matches against Boca and is expected to return after recovering from the flu. Other key players include midfielder Juan Quintero and Franco Armani, who is considered one of the best goalkeepers in Latin America.\n\n\u201cThe pressure is very high because the public is following closely and the result will matter to them. It will be remembered for many years because it is a unique final,\u201d said Oscar Mangione, a sports psychologist who has worked with Boca but is a devoted River fan. \u201cIt now depends on the players, on the coaches and how they deal with that pressure.\u201d\n\nThe pressure, the history, the animosity: No one in Argentina seems to be talking about anything else.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re living a unique moment,\u201d Boca captain Pablo Perez said, \u201cfirst because it\u2019s a final, and second because it\u2019s against River.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Debora Rey contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) \u2014 The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals, in two separate cases, has upheld a murder conviction and rejected a request to withdraw a no-contest plea to manslaughter charges in the deaths of a woman and her 14-month-old granddaughter.\n\nThe court on Thursday upheld the conviction and life with parole sentence of Kendell Sparrow in the stabbing death of William Rivers in Stillwater.\n\nSparrow argued there was insufficient evidence to convict him and that improper testimony was allowed at his trial.\n\nThe court also turned down Auntra Edmonds\u2019 request to withdraw his no-contest plea or reduce his two life with parole sentences for first-degree manslaughter in the deaths of Wanda Perry and her granddaughter.\n\nProsecutors say Edmonds was driving while intoxicated when his vehicle struck the victims in a yard in Mangum.", "LAS VEGAS (AP) \u2014 Democratic state Sen.

(AP) \u2014 Tennessee safety Todd Kelly Jr. always believed he\u2019d play for his hometown school again and end his college career on his own terms, no matter how much his knee problems threatened to derail those plans.\n\nNow the fifth-year senior is getting that chance.\n\nKelly was Tennessee\u2019s leading tackler two years ago , but a knee injury limited him to two games in 2017 and sidelined him for the start of this season. After working his way back, Kelly has started Tennessee\u2019s last two games to boost an injury-riddled secondary.\n\n\u201cI never had a doubt in my mind that I was going to play the game of football again,\u201d Kelly said.\n\nKelly might not ever recapture the form he showed in 2016, when he recorded 71 tackles for a team that went 9-4 and finished in the Top 25. But the fact he\u2019s playing at all shows the tenacity of this Knoxville resident.\n\n\u201cTodd will be the first to tell you he\u2019s probably not the same player that he was two or three years ago because of his leg, but it\u2019s kind of a testament to his character about working hard to get back to give himself an opportunity,\u201d Tennessee coach Jeremy Pruitt said. \u201cHe\u2019s a smart guy who\u2019s got a toughness. We\u2019re glad that he has got himself able to play.\u201d\n\nKelly\u2019s knee injury caused him to play just two games last year during a 4-8 season that included the firing of Butch Jones , the coach who recruited him to Tennessee. Kelly graduated in May with a degree in biological sciences, so he had no real need to return for a fifth year and try to impress a new coaching staff.\n\nHe came back anyway and said it wasn\u2019t a tough decision at all.\n\n\u201cMy blood runs orange,\u201d said Kelly, the son of former Tennessee defensive end and first-round draft pick Todd Kelly Sr. \u201cI grew up here, a Knoxville native. So when I had a decision to come back again, why would I not try to extend my career for this ball team and for this community and this city? I wanted to play for Coach Pruitt. He\u2019s a great coach, a great defensive mind.\u201d\n\nEven when he hurt himself again during an offseason incident in which he fell from a 30-foot wall and required a trip to the hospital, Kelly remained steadfast in his desire to return. The fall occurred during an argument with his girlfriend that didn\u2019t result in any charges.\n\nHis comeback wouldn\u2019t be easy.\n\nKelly sat out Tennessee\u2019s first four games as he worked his way back. His first appearance of the season was in special-teams duty Sept. 29 against Georgia. He accepted this lesser role and devoted himself to helping out his younger teammates.\n\n\u201cHe had a significant injury,\u201d Pruitt said. \u201cHe worked really hard to give himself a chance to come back. It was late in the summer before he was actually kind of running around and participating a little bit, and as long as he\u2019d been off, it takes a while to get your body back in shape.\u201d\n\nHis responsibilities expanded as Tennessee (4-5, 1-4 SEC) dealt with injuries to safeties Micah Abernathy and Trevon Flowers, who have each missed the Vols\u2019 last four games. Pruitt says the availability of Flowers and Abernathy for Saturday\u2019s matchup with No. 12 Kentucky (7-2, 5-2, No. 11 College Football Playoff) will be a game-time decision.\n\nKelly made six tackles in a 27-24 loss at South Carolina two weeks ago. He followed that up by getting seven tackles in a 14-3 victory over Charlotte last week.\n\n\u201cHe just kept his head down and kept grinding,\u201d safety Nigel Warrior said. \u201cHe wanted to get back on the field, and that\u2019s what he\u2019s doing now. He\u2019s doing a great job. He\u2019s fighting. Every day, he\u2019s fighting.\u201d\n\nAfter growing up in Knoxville as the son of a former Tennessee star, Kelly has a special appreciation for this opportunity.\n\nHe\u2019s savoring this final chance and wants to make the most of it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve learned so much about the game of football and about this program that I didn\u2019t even know when I was younger, coming to every home game in the stands in Section YY, looking down on the Tennessee Volunteers running through the \u2018T,\u2019 \u201d Kelly said. \u201cWhen I think about how I have only two more opportunities to do that, it\u2019s a blessing.

Venter dropkicked three extra points in the game. (David Pennock/Shepherd University Athletics via AP)\n\nRuan Venter learned how to dropkick playing rugby in his native South Africa and sometimes would do it for fun during football practices at NCAA Division II Shepherd University in West Virginia.\n\nUntil a couple weeks ago, he wouldn\u2019t have fathomed dropkicking in a game.\n\nIn scenes harkening to a bygone era, Venter successfully dropkicked three extra points to the delight of teammates, fans, game officials and even opposing West Virginia Wesleyan on Oct. 27. Venter, whose first name is pronounced Roo-On, hopes to get another opportunity in his senior day game against Virginia-Wise on Saturday.\n\nA standout punter who has drawn the attention of NFL scouts, Venter is the first player known to have scored on a dropkick since Matt Newman of Division III Illinois College did it against Grinnell in September 2013.\n\n\u201cI had no idea about the history of it,\u201d Venter said. \u201cI did dropkicks my whole life, and by doing them again I thought about back home, being outside and doing the dropkicks with friends in my home country. Maybe I miss it a little bit. But it also made me excited I could bring that kind of kicking back into the game and, with that, making the people happy and making some history for them as well.\u201d\n\nThe dropkick was a staple of football back in the days of leather helmets. The kicker takes the snap, holds the ball waist high and drops it straight down as he strides with his non-kicking leg. He strikes the ball as it touches the ground or just as it bounces up.\n\nThe popularity of the forward pass led to the evolution of the ball in the 1930s, from more rounded to sleeker and pointed on the ends. That made it easier to throw but more difficult to dropkick because bounces off the drop became unpredictable. Thus, the dropkick became a novelty.\n\nShepherd coach Ernie McCook knew about Venter\u2019s special talent and had the team practice extra points and field goals with Venter dropkicking in case an emergency came up.\n\nVenter\u2019s time came after the team\u2019s regular kicker, who had struggled with back tightness for a week, missed two straight extra points. McCook wanted to preserve the freshman backup kicker\u2019s redshirt year, so Venter was the next option.\n\nVenter is a capable place-kicker, but he is the team\u2019s regular holder, and McCook wasn\u2019t comfortable with anyone else doing the holding.\n\n\u201cAt that point,\u201d McCook said, \u201cthe dropkick was the best option for us.\u201d\n\nMcCook had given the officials a heads-up a dropkick might be coming. Venter split the uprights to give Shepherd a 32-7 lead in what would be a 58-35 win.\n\n\u201cAs the officials were jogging up the field to set the ball for the kickoff,\u201d McCook said, \u201cthey said, \u2018Hey, Coach, thanks for that one, man. That\u2019s off my bucket list. I always wanted to see one.\u2019\u201d\n\nWVW coach Del Smith said that first dropkick came as a big surprise. He and his team saw four more, and blocked one. Venter pushed another one wide right.\n\n\u201cKudos to them for having that in their back pocket,\u201d Smith said. \u201cIn general, when I see guys get creative schematically, when you\u2019re in this business, of course you enjoy it. You just hope it\u2019s not at your expense.\u201d\n\nVenter said he planned to ask McCook to give him another chance if Shepherd (7-2) gets a comfortable lead against Virginia-Wise (3-6).\n\n\u201cI would always entertain it,\u201d McCook said. \u201cI love it when our kids get a chance to have a lot of fun. He\u2019s been a great player and a great person in our program. I won\u2019t tell you it\u2019s out of the question. It\u2019s something we would consider.

(Bruce Newman/The Oxford Eagle via AP)\n\nCOLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) \u2014 South Carolina has finally won consecutive games this year, something the Gamecocks believe has given them a jolt of confidence that will help them the rest of the season.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all a confidence thing,\u201d quarterback Jake Bentley said. \u201cConfidence in the game plan, confidence in what we\u2019re starting off with. You can definitely see that.\u201d\n\nSouth Carolina (5-3, 4-3 Southeastern Conference) hopes to have a similarly strong performance against No. 19 Florida (6-3, 4-3).\n\nSomething had been missing the first half of the season for South Carolina as it literally went back-and-forth between winning and losing.\n\nBut since a midseason break last month, the Gamecocks have found ways to pull out games.\n\nThey were down 21-9 in the third quarter against Tennessee before rallying for a 27-24 victory. A week later, South Carolina trailed Ole Miss 44-34 early in the fourth quarter before scoring a pair of rushing touchdowns, the last on Bentley\u2019s 4-yard run, for a 48-44 victory.\n\nSouth Carolina entered the season looking to compete in the SEC Eastern Division after winning nine games a year ago. But losses to three ranked programs in Georgia, Kentucky and Texas A&M knocked the Gamecocks out of contention and struggling to find a winning formula.\n\nGamecocks coach Will Muschamp has been around his share of programs where when things went wrong, the effort waned, concentration lagged and players started thinking about next year.\n\nThat was never the case at South Carolina, he said.\n\nMuschamp said the team\u2019s older leaders have led the way the past few weeks, forgetting the problems of the past and getting younger teammates to focus on what\u2019s next.\n\n\u201cWe talk in terms of winning downs and that wins possessions and that wins games, so regardless of the circumstance or situation, we just keep playing,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Gamecocks recent success coincided with a more effective run game. South Carolina has 100-yard rushers in Rico Dowdle (140 yards against Tennessee) and Mond Denson (102 yards against Mississippi) in consecutive games for the first time all season.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still not where we want to be,\u201d said right guard Sadarius Hutcherson, a sophomore. \u201cWe\u2019ve still got flaws we need to work on. But I\u2019m very proud of how far we\u2019ve come.\u201d\n\nHutcherson said there was no panic or finger pointing during the team\u2019s bye week, which followed a disappointing loss to Texas A&M where the Gamecocks fell behind 16-0 and fell 26-23 despite a second-half rally.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t need to do any of that,\u201d Hutcherson said. \u201cJust go back to work.\u201d\n\nBentley\u2019s play has picked up, too, the past few weeks. He was bothered by a knee injury sustained at Kentucky in September and missed a win over Missouri a week later.\n\nHis first halves against the Aggies and Vols were awful: Bentley combined to go 9 for 25 passing for 67 yards, two interceptions and zero TDs.\n\nLike the Gamecocks, Bentley rallied in the second half each time, completing 19 of 26 passes for 308 yards, four touchdowns and no picks.\n\nBentley had a more complete showing at Ole Miss, finishing with 323 yards and two TDs passing, including a highlight reel reception by Bryan Edwards on a 75-yard score. Bentley says part of that is his knee feeling better and part is the team\u2019s resolve not to throw away the season because some things went wrong early.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t ever let yourself get down,\u201d Bentley said. \u201cNo one on this team is going to let that happen.\u201d\n\nMuschamp believes that, too.

(AP) \u2014 There\u2019s some irony to what Cooper Rothe is doing.\n\nGrowing up in Longmont, Colorado, Rothe never thought he\u2019d be a kicker. In fact, he rarely passed up the opportunity to rib those who seemed to have the simplest task in football.\n\n\u201cEven in high school, I couldn\u2019t imagine myself being a kicker,\u201d Rothe said. \u201cI was always the kid that made fun of those kickers. Like, \u2018Dang, that\u2019s probably the easiest job. Why can\u2019t you just make everything?\u2019\u201d\n\nBut that\u2019s exactly what he became during his prep career, splitting his time at Longmont High as a kicker and defensive back. Three years later, Wyoming\u2019s placekicker is one of the best in college football.\n\nRothe has connected on 94 percent of his field goals this season, putting himself on pace for one of the best seasons ever for a Wyoming placekicker. He\u2019s six shy of setting a single-season school record for made field goals with at least two games left starting with the Cowboys\u2019 Nov. 17 matchup against Air Force.\n\nThe 5-foot-11, 174-pound junior made his first 15 field goals this season and hit on 18 straight dating back to last year\u2019s Famous Idaho Potato Bowl \u2014 the longest streak in the nation \u2014 before missing on a 43-yard attempt midway through the first quarter of a chilly, gusty win over San Jose State last week. Winds inside War Memorial Stadium reached more than 30 miles per hour at times, though Rothe said they were worse during warmups.\n\nHe realized he\u2019d overcompensated for the wind once the ball left his foot. The kick went wide right.\n\n\u201cI think I tried placing it a certain way and I think it didn\u2019t move it as much, so I think I should\u2019ve just trusted it a little bit more with my normal swing,\u201d Rothe told the Casper Star-Tribune. \u201cBut it was moving a little bit.\n\n\u201cI guess it was fun to have a little streak going there, but to start another one is the goal, I think. I guess the goal every game is to make every field goal, and obviously that didn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nRegardless of the distance, it\u2019s happened far more often than not. Rothe has converted at an 80-percent clip for his career with five of his field goals this season covering at least 40 yards, including a career-long 51-yarder at Missouri on Sept. 8.\n\n\u201cA lot of those points have added up,\u201d Wyoming coach Craig Bohl said. \u201cHe\u2019s been really consistent. He\u2019s owned his work. He spends a lot of time watching himself. We videotape a lot of his kicks, so he\u2019s been a real student of the game.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been a gradual progression the last three years for Rothe, who made just 65 percent (13 of 20) of his kicks as a freshman. The misses ate at him so much that Rothe said he got to where he was attempting more than 50 field goals during practice, which left bruises on his foot. It served as a lesson in preparation that\u2019s ultimately helped preserve his stamina.\n\n\u201cI knew I had things to work on, but I thought it was just things I had to fix right away, so I\u2019d just be kicking 24-7 instead of watching film and learning that way,\u201d Rothe said. \u201cI think learning that way and learning there\u2019s a certain amount of balls you can kick in practice and the rest is just mental.\n\n\u201cNow it\u2019s down between 20 and 30 (during practice). I think that\u2019s helped my leg a lot.\u201d\n\nRothe improved drastically on his consistency last season, connecting on 83 percent (15 of 18) of his field goals that included a career-long 49-yarder at the time. Now he\u2019s the national leader in field-goal percentage amid a breakout season in which he\u2019s a semifinalist for the Lou Groza Award, which is annually awarded to the nation\u2019s top collegiate placekicker.\n\n\u201cNo matter how far the kick or what situation it is in the game, just keep the same mindset to do one job \u2014 make a field goal,\u201d Rothe said. \u201cEven on kickoffs, just do your job, trust your teammates and try to reward the offense for the field position and get them points.\u201d\n\nRothe can\u2019t help but get a kick out of it all in more ways than one.\n\n\u201cI definitely couldn\u2019t imagine this, so it\u2019s a blessing to be here,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Casper (Wyo.)

(AP Photo/Jae C. Hong, File)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Hardcore fans of the Beatles like to pore over every detail of the band and endlessly dissect their songs. Then there\u2019s Giles Martin, who manages to time travel to meet the Fab Four.\n\nMartin is the son of legendary Beatles producer George Martin, and he\u2019s lately been returning to the treasure trove of original recording sessions to remix key albums by John, Paul, George and Ringo.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really nerve-wracking because it\u2019s a legacy of music which is really important,\u201d the soft-spoken Martin said. \u201cWhat I do is make sure I provide the fans \u2014 and people who don\u2019t even know the Beatles \u2014 with music that\u2019s worth listening to and is interesting.\u201d\n\nMartin last year remixed \u201cSgt. Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band\u201d and this year resurfaces with a fascinating and exhaustive look at \u201cThe Beatles,\u201d better known as the \u201cWhite Album,\u201d which contains such classics as \u201cBack in the U.S.S.R.,\u201d \u2033Blackbird\u201d and \u201cOb-La-Di, Ob-La-Da.\u201d It coincides with celebrations for the album\u2019s 50th birthday.\n\nBesides punchier, remixed versions of the 30 songs on the original double album, the anniversary package includes 27 acoustic demos of material the Beatles made at Harrison\u2019s house before going into the studio and 50 studio outtakes, including the unreleased \u201cNot Guilty,\u201d a studio jam of \u201cBlue Moon\u201d and early versions of \u201cLet It Be,\u201d \u2033Lady Madonna\u201d and \u201cAcross the Universe,\u201d which would appear on other albums.\n\nGiles Martin, the son of legendary Beatles producer George Martin, has returned to the original recording sessions for the \"White Album\" for a box set that includes demos, 50 studio outtakes and remixes. The new set coincides with the album's 50th birthday. (Nov. 7)\n\nMartin was tapped by the surviving Beatles and the wives of Harrison and Lennon to rummage around in Abbey Road Studios in London and re-listen to everything, including abandoned songs and rehearsals.\n\nThat meant going through 107 takes of \u201cSexy Sadie,\u201d dozens of versions of both \u201cI\u2019m So Tired\u201d and \u201cLong, Long, Long\u201d and a 13-minute \u201cHelter Skelter.\u201d It meant hearing the Beatles discuss songs, joke and even order lunch. (You can hear Harrison at one point from the studio order a \u201ccheese, lettuce, Marmite sandwich.\u201d)\n\nMartin couldn\u2019t help using a Beatles reference to explain what his goals are: \u201cI\u2019m sort of trying to peel back the layers \u2014 the glass onion, if you like. I peel back the layers so you get to hear what I can hear at Abbey Road.\u201d\n\nAmong the gems in the box set is an unrecorded Lennon song called \u201cChild of Nature\u201d that will later morph into his solo hit \u201cJealous Guy\u201d and also a very cool \u201cGood Night\u201d stripped of the orchestrations it got on the \u201cWhite Album.\u201d You can hear \u201cHappiness Is a Warm Gun\u201d start out life as quite gentle before ending up on the \u201cWhite Album\u201d like a template for Frank Zappa.\n\nThe Beatles worked through the summer of 1968, often in exhausting all-night sessions. Martin says the multiple takes for many songs may be because the band had largely stopped performing live.\n\n\u201cI think the most revealing thing for me working on the \u2018White Album\u2019 is just how creative they were, all of the time,\u201d said Martin. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like the studio couldn\u2019t handle the level of demand that they wanted to do and the amount of songs they wanted to record.\u201d\n\nMartin\u2019s father was heavily involved in the Beatles\u2019 prior album, \u201cSgt. Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band,\u201d and was even lauded as the architect of their sound. But the Fab Four came together for the recording of the \u201cWhite Album\u201d in the summer of 1968 with a different goal in mind.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t want an architect. They wanted to build an album from the bricks up and without any real idea about what it was going to be,\u201d said Martin. \u201cThey indulged themselves because they knew that each member of the band would make the song better.\u201d\n\nWilliam Moylan, a professor of music and sound recording technology at the University of Massachusetts at Lowell, said the recording of the \u201cWhite Album\u201d found the members of the Beatles at a crossroads.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really where the Beatles are exploring their own individuality and they\u2019re still working off the collective. They\u2019re coming out of \u2018Sgt. Pepper\u2019s\u2019 and they\u2019re coming out of \u2018Magical Mystery Tour\u2019 and they\u2019re coming out of the psychedelia,\u201d Moylan said. \u201cThey\u2019re branching out, into popular music, into musical theater, back to rock, even Tin Pan Alley-type pieces.\u201d\n\nThe accepted wisdom when it comes to the \u201cWhite Album\u201d is that it was a rocky time for the band, which was disintegrating. Starr quit and walked out for an 11-day period. Critics have called the record a mess \u2014 a brilliant mess, of course \u2014 with each member often delivering solo songs.\n\nBut, like a polite Moses coming down from the mountain with the original tablets, Martin disagrees. He believes some of those interpretations to be exaggerated. He hears the Fab Four working together even on songs long considered to be done by only one Beatle.\n\n\u201cThe revealing thing for me is you go back and listen to the tapes and what we have on the tapes is a cohesive unit playing together and working on songs together,\u201d says Martin, who was born a year after the \u201cWhite Album\u201d was released.\n\n\u201cListen to the sessions \u2014 they were very warm. And that\u2019s the surprising thing. I think we thought the \u2018White Album\u2019 was this disparate, angry record \u2014 and it has certainly elements of that \u2014 but, in essence, the four of them made an album together they wanted to make.\u201d\n\nThat sounds about right said Moylan, who has been a record producer, engineer, composer and teacher for 25 years: \u201cI\u2019ve really always had a sense that the Beatles were professional musicians as well as being friends. When they were performing, any personal friction evaporated because it was all about the music.\u201d\n\n___\n\nOnline: https://www.thebeatles.com\n\n___\n\nMark Kennedy is at http://twitter.com/KennedyTwits", "CHAPEL HILL, N.C.

(AP Photo/Steve Nesius, File)\n\nSEATTLE (AP) \u2014 Mallex Smith was made a promise by Seattle general manager Jerry Dipoto when he was acquired for a second time by the Mariners after an initial tenure that lasted less than two hours.\n\n\u201cDipoto didn\u2019t guarantee anything, but he said I at least have 78 minutes,\u201d Smith joked. \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nSmith is back with the Mariners as part of a five-player deal between Seattle and Tampa Bay on Thursday that landed the Rays catcher Mike Zunino and outfielder Guillermo Heredia.\n\nThe swap continued a lengthy trade history between the teams and came as a surprise to Zunino, who said he had recent conversations with Seattle manager Scott Servais looking ahead to 2019.\n\n\u201cI was shocked. To see your name in trade talks, let alone this early in the offseason, was beyond my expectations,\u201d Zunino said.\n\nSmith, 25, stole a career-best 40 bases this year and was caught 12 times. He hit .296, tied for the major league lead with 10 triples and had 40 RBIs. He is not eligible for free agency until after the 2022 season. He signed with San Diego in 2012, was traded to Atlanta in December 2014 and was dealt to the Mariners in January 2017, then sent to the Rays on the same day in a trade that shipped left-hander Drew Smyly to Seattle.\n\nHis previous Seattle stint lasted all of 77 minutes before he was sent to the Rays.\n\n\u201cBringing Mallex back home to Seattle is exciting for us all,\u201d Dipoto said in a statement. \u201cHis combination of speed, base running impact, defense and on-base abilities are unique in today\u2019s game. We believe his breakout 2018 performance reflects the many ways his skills will positively impact the Mariners for years to come.\u201d\n\nSmith said he\u2019s going in with the idea of playing in center field, which would allow Seattle to move Dee Gordon to his natural position of second base. But the move for Smith could just be the start of a hectic offseason overhaul for the Mariners.\n\n\u201cI feel like it\u2019s a good fit. I feel like the team wants me,\u201d Smith said. \u201cIt\u2019s very comfortable when you know the team wants you. Jerry has traded for me twice, so I feel like I\u2019ll fit in well here.\u201d\n\nHeredia, who turns 28 in January, hit .236 with five homers and 19 RBIs in 337 plate appearances as a fourth outfielder for the Mariners this year. He is not eligible for free agency until after the 2022 season.\n\nZunino, 27, was taken by Seattle with the third overall pick in the 2012 amateur draft and signed for a $4 million bonus. He hit just .201 this year but had 20 homers with 44 RBIs, down from a .251 average, 25 homers and 64 RBIs in 2017. While well-regarded for his defense, he has struck out 310 times in 760 at-bats during the past two seasons.\n\nZunino said an oblique injury just before the start of the regular season caused him to struggle at the plate and led to his drop from the progress he had shown as a hitter in 2017.\n\n\u201cIt really took me longer than I\u2019d like. I came back and it took me longer than I would have liked to get comfortable,\u201d Zunino said. \u201cOnce that happened, I ended up giving away too many at-bats ... tried to chase too much. I think getting back to that, trying to take care of my body, getting back to 100 percent is the main goal. I feel great now.\u201d\n\nZunino grew up in Cape Coral, Florida, and played for the University of Florida.

(Alisha Jucevic/The Columbian via AP)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 More Latinos will serve in Congress next year than ever before \u2014 at least 42, with one House race to be decided.\n\nWith Latinos reaching an unprecedented level of representation on Capitol Hill, The Associated Press was able to document that 34 percent of Hispanics voters approve of how Donald Trump is handling his job as president, and other factors that mobilized the vote among the nation\u2019s largest ethnic or racial minority.\n\nThe latest Latino winner was GOP Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler of Washington state, who claimed victory Wednesday for a fifth term over Democrat Carolyn Long.\n\nIn the race for an open seat in a GOP-held district that includes part of Orange County, California, Democrat Gil Cisneros trails Republican Young Kim, who\u2019s trying to become the first Korean-American immigrant woman elected to the House. Cisneros is a first-time candidate who won a $266 million lottery jackpot.\n\nThirty-three of 44 Latino Democratic candidates and seven of 15 Latino Republican candidates won their races.\n\nTwo Latino senators weren\u2019t on Tuesday\u2019s ballot: Florida Republican Marco Rubio and Nevada Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto.\n\nAccording to AP VoteCast, a new tool that replaced the in-person exit poll as a source of detailed information about the American electorate, almost one-third of Hispanics voters approve of how Trump is handling the presidency, while 66 percent said they disapprove.\n\nThe rate of approval may surprise some, given the harsh rhetoric Trump has used about Hispanics. He called Mexican immigrants \u201crapists\u201d and \u201ccriminals\u201d when he first announced his bid for the White House in the summer of 2015.\n\nMore than 4 in 10 Hispanic voters said they approve of how Trump is handling the economy, and about 4 in 10 said he\u2019s a strong leader.\n\nThe unemployment rate for Americans of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity fell to 4.4 percent in October, the lowest recorded level for this group since 1973.\n\nAsked whether Trump was a factor in their votes, 19 percent said they voted to support him, 49 percent voted to oppose him and 31 percent said Trump was not a factor in their votes.\n\nAbout 64 percent of Latinos voted for Democratic congressional candidates and 33 percent voted for Republicans.\n\nLatino women were more likely to vote for Democrats than Latino men, 68 percent to 59 percent. Younger Latinos were even more Democratic than their older counterparts, with 68 percent of those under age 45 voting for Democrats compared with 59 percent of those age 45 and over.\n\nAP VoteCast is an innovative nationwide survey of voters nationwide, including 7,738 Latino voters.\n\nThe survey showed 26 percent of Latino voters said immigration was the most important issue facing the country, 23 percent said health care and 18 percent said the economy. That\u2019s comparable to the breakdown among voters overall.\n\nThree-quarters of Latinos said they think immigrants do more to help the country than to hurt it, and 8 in 10 said they think immigrants living in the U.S. illegally should be offered a chance to apply for legal status. Two-thirds said they oppose building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nIn Florida\u2019s Senate race, Hispanics were somewhat more likely to say they voted for the Republican candidate than Hispanics nationwide, with 45 percent overall voting for Republican Rick Scott, including 59 percent of Cubans.\n\nAP VoteCast is a survey of the American electorate conducted in all 50 states by NORC at the University of Chicago for the AP and Fox News.\n\nThe survey of 116,792 voters and 22,137 nonvoters was conducted Oct. 31 to Nov. 6, concluding as polls closed on Election Day.\n\nIt combined interviews in English and Spanish with a random sample of registered voters drawn from state voter files; with self-identified registered voters conducted using NORC\u2019s probability-based AmeriSpeak panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population; and with self-identified registered voters selected from nonprobability online panels.\n\nParticipants selected from state voter files were contacted by phone and mail, and had the opportunity to take the survey by phone or online.

Houston is the second team in NFL history to win six in a row after opening 0-3 and the first since the Giants did it in 1970. (AP Photo/Eric Christian Smith, File)\n\nHOUSTON (AP) \u2014 Ask Jadeveon Clowney how the Houston Texans turned around their season by winning six straight games after an 0-3 start and the hulking defensive end breaks into song.\n\n\u201cStarted from the bottom now we\u2019re here,\u201d he bellows. \u201cStarted from the bottom now the whole team here.\u201d\n\nWhile the 2013 Drake tune is a little old to be the team\u2019s anthem, the sentiment of the song couldn\u2019t be more fitting for these Texans.\n\nThey occupied the basement of the AFC South after opening the season with losses to New England, Tennessee and the New York Giants by a combined 13 points. After falling into such a big hole early, the Texans were written off by many as headed to a lost season.\n\nEveryone insists that such a defeatist sentiment never took hold within the team, with the struggles galvanizing them to get on track and prove the doubters wrong.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t quit. Everyone keeps fighting. Everyone keeps believing,\u201d quarterback Deshaun Watson said. \u201cEveryone keeps fighting to the very, very end. That is what we do. Regardless of the situation or the adversity, we are always going to keep fighting. That is how we feel.\u201d\n\nHouston is the second team in NFL history to win six in a row after opening 0-3, the first since the Giants in 1970. The winning streak has the Texans in first place in their division and in good position to compete for their third AFC South title in the last four seasons.\n\nA big reason for Houston\u2019s turnaround has been the play of Watson and defensive end J.J. Watt. Both have started each game this year after having their 2017 seasons cut short by major injuries. Watson tore a knee ligament in practice after appearing in seven games in 2017. Watt played just eight games in the previous two years because of back surgeries and a broken leg.\n\nWatt is tied for third in the NFL with nine sacks and his four forced fumbles are tied for most in the league.\n\n\u201cI know he probably doesn\u2019t want to talk about it too much, but I\u2019ve never seen anything like it,\u201d coach Bill O\u2019Brien said. \u201cTo come back from what he\u2019s been able to come back from, some really serious injuries, and to be able to play at the level that he\u2019s playing at, it just says all you need to know about him and how much he cares about the team and how much he wants to help this organization win.\u201d\n\nWatson, the 12th overall pick in last year\u2019s draft, has thrown for 2,389 yards with 17 touchdowns and seven interceptions despite being slowed by lung and rib injuries. O\u2019Brien said his diligence in coming to the facility every day after his injury last season to study film and talk to coaches has helped Watson take a step forward this year.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s grown a lot,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cHe\u2019s just an awesome guy to work with. He cares about studying, he cares about putting time in to prepare for each game. I think he\u2019s learned a lot about NFL defenses. He\u2019s had a lot thrown at him defensively this year, whether it\u2019s third-down defenses, red-area defenses. He\u2019s improved every week.\u201d\n\nWatson has been helped by the stellar play of receiver DeAndre Hopkins, who is No. 3 in the NFL with 894 yards receiving and whose seven touchdowns are tied for second. The Texans hope that new addition Demaryius Thomas, acquired in a trade with Denver last Tuesday, will make more of an impact after the break with some time to learn the offense.\n\nHopkins, who has five touchdowns in the last four games, said despite this strong stretch the Texans are approaching things the same way they did when they were desperate for a victory.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got the same mentality, and that\u2019s win,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we go to practice and that\u2019s why we wake up every day. It\u2019s the same mentality we had when we were 0-3. Nothing\u2019s changed.\u201d\n\nThey know that if they let up, their season will end prematurely, just as it did when they went 4-12 in 2017.\n\nO\u2019Brien let out a slight chuckle when asked if 0-3 feels like forever ago.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a really long time ago,\u201d he said. \u201cI think our players understand that, and I think the difference between 0-3 and where we are now is not a big difference. We\u2019re just making some more plays, we\u2019re coaching some things better. I think our guys have to \u2014 and they do \u2014 understand that every week is going to be difficult.\u201d\n\nFirst up is a trip to Washington on Nov. 18 before a Monday night matchup with Tennessee on Nov. 26 in the first of three straight home games when a win would be key in moving closer to taking their division.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just important to note that we haven\u2019t been blowing anybody out,\u201d safety Tyrann Mathieu said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we are a complacent group of guys. We\u2019ve been in some fist fights, some real close ballgames, so it\u2019s not like everything is cookie cutter and everything is going all good for us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe still have things we can improve on and work on, so I think that\u2019s what\u2019s going to keep us pushing forward.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) \u2014 For the second straight year following President Donald Trump\u2019s election, voters in Philadelphia\u2019s politically moderate suburbs flexed their muscles to help Democrats.\n\nBucks, Chester and Montgomery counties recorded the highest turnout rates in the state, according to an Associated Press analysis of preliminary results from Tuesday\u2019s election. Montgomery County led the way, with nearly 67 percent turnout, and party officials there credited a groundswell of activism in response to Trump.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of energy, and that energy started after November 2016 and grew and grew and grew, and there were a lot of motivated people canvassing for months and it just built up until November, and all that hard work paid off,\u201d said Rep. Tim Briggs, D-Montgomery.\n\nPhiladelphia\u2019s four suburban counties, including Delaware County, accounted for a larger share of the statewide vote than they usually do, exceeding 23 percent. In past statewide elections, that percentage has topped out at just above 22 percent.\n\nVoters there flipped at least 12 state House seats and four state Senate seats from red to blue, the biggest single pickups by Democrats in decades. Democrats could expand their catch: five House and two Senate districts, all but one most recently in Republican hands, remained too close to call Thursday.\n\nSuburban voters gave Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf a staggering 320,000-vote margin over Republican challenger Scott Wagner, the biggest margin since 2006 when then-Gov. Ed Rendell blew out Republican challenger Lynn Swann in the four counties by 374,000 votes.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Bob Casey also won by 283,000, beating Republican U.S. Rep. Lou Barletta on Tuesday.\n\nWinning the suburbs has almost always been necessary to win the rest of Pennsylvania. But in 2016, Trump lost the suburbs by 188,000 votes to Democrat Hillary Clinton on his way to becoming the first Republican presidential candidate since 1988 to claim Pennsylvania\u2019s electoral votes.\n\nNow, Trump\u2019s performance as president is helping drive strong turnout and stronger election performances for Democrats in the four heavily populated counties, officials from both political parties said Thursday.\n\nIn last year\u2019s municipal election, Democrats inflamed by Trump scored big victories in county and municipal races across Philadelphia\u2019s suburbs, advancing a decades-long shift in those one-time Republican bastions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be even more problematic for many of these folks two years from now that are running on the Republican ticket,\u201d said John Cordisco, Bucks County\u2019s Democratic Party chairman.\n\nDemocrats have long sought deeper inroads into suburban Philadelphia\u2019s bloc of eight state Senate seats. Currently, Democrats hold one. After January\u2019s swearing in of new senators, Democrats will hold a majority of those eight Senate seats.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Jay Costa, D-Allegheny, credited good candidates, a couple open seats and an outpouring of voters.\n\nIn the House, Democrats now control a majority of the roughly 40 seats that sprawl across the four suburban counties.\n\nStill, the news wasn\u2019t all bad for Republicans in the suburbs: U.S. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick narrowly won a second term in his closely divided district in Bucks County.\n\nAround the rest of the state, Republicans held on to their majorities in the state House and state Senate, and two other Republican congressmen from around the state narrowly survived stiff challenges. Turnout was relatively poor in several counties where it could have helped Democrats.\n\nFor instance, in the northwestern Pennsylvania congressional seat defended by four-term Republican Rep. Mike Kelly, turnout in heavily Democratic Erie County barely broke 50 percent. Meanwhile, turnout broke 55 percent in the four counties won by Kelly, helping him to a 4 percentage point win over Democrat Ron DiNicola.\n\nIn Lancaster County, one of the most populous Republican-majority counties, turnout broke 60 percent, as it did in several other less-populous Republican-majority counties. Republicans said Thursday that Trump is motivating their voters, as well as Democrats.\n\n\u201cI have found that much more of the voters are awakening to what\u2019s going on,\u201d said Pat Poprik, the GOP chairwoman in Bucks County. \u201cWe were trying to get more Republicans out in the election and we were successful, and so were the Democrats.\u201d\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to note Donald Trump was first Republican to win Pennsylvania since 1988, not simply the first.", "This undated product image provided by Amphastar shows Primatene Mist.

(AP) \u2014 A new version of the once-popular asthma inhaler Primatene Mist will soon return to U.S. stores.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration approved the over-the-counter aerosol inhaler late Wednesday. It\u2019s for temporary relief of mild, intermittent asthma symptoms in people ages 12 and up.\n\nThe original Primatene Mist was discontinued seven years ago because the inhaler\u2019s ozone-depleting propellant had been banned. That version had been marketed for half a century, including in memorable TV ads.\n\nThe new product developed by Amphastar Pharmaceuticals uses a safer propellant. The inhaler will cost about $25 and contain 160 doses. It should be available by the end of the year.\n\n\u201cRescue inhalers\u201d are meant to quickly relieve asthma symptoms such as wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath and chest tightness, which can be triggered by pollen, mold, dust mites, pet dander, stress or exercising in the cold.\n\nPrimatene Mist\u2019s active ingredient, the hormone epinephrine, relaxes muscles in the lungs to increase airflow. The product is the only FDA-approved over-the-counter inhaler. Numerous prescription rescue inhalers, containing the medicine albuterol or levalbuterol, are available.\n\nIn a statement Thursday, FDA officials noted concerns that some people may inappropriately use or overuse the new inhaler. The agency said it should not be substituted for prescription treatments or used by people with severe asthma.\n\nPrimatene Mist was pulled from stores in 2011, but it still has many fans, including tens of thousands who have liked Facebook pages advocating its return. TV ads for the old version touted its speedy relief with endorsements from athletes such as Bob Gibson and Jackie Joyner-Kersee, or by showing a gasping person getting relief as a stopwatch ticked off 15 seconds.\n\nAn Amphastar subsidiary bought rights to the product\u2019s name and spent several years improving it.\n\nThe new version contains less alcohol and epinephrine, which can increase heart rate, especially if the inhaler is used too much.

He drew on access to U.S. intelligence to help unmask a cartel informant, who was later tortured and killed, according to filings by prosecutors.\n\nArzate turned himself over to American officials in 2017 and changed his plea in May from not guilty to no contest to obstruction and conspiracy to obstruct justice.\n\nSergio \u201cEl Grande\u201d Villarreal Barragan, a longtime confidant to the head of the Beltran Leyva cartel, testified at Thursday\u2019s hearing. He described to U.S. District Judge Harry Leinenweber how Mexican syndicates rely heavily on corrupt police, like Arzate, to expand their illegal operations and vanquish rivals.\n\nGovernment attorneys called Barragan and the U.S. agent to testify during a five-hour sentencing hearing in a bid to buttress their argument that Arzate deserved a tougher 10-year prison term. Prosecutor Katherine Sawyer told the court the sentence the defense wanted, 17 months , would amount to a \u201cslap on the wrist.\u201d\n\nIn a statement to the judge, Arzate gave a forthright defense of his police work. Leinenweber interrupted Arzate at one point, asking: \u201cIs it your position you did absolutely nothing wrong?\u201d While Arzate said that wasn\u2019t his position, he then went on to concede no wrongdoing. He also offered no apologies during his 10-minute statement.\n\nArzate\u2019s Chicago lawyer, Joseph Lopez, has portrayed police meetings with cartel figures in cash-for-intel deals as standard in Mexico. He echoed that before the judge Thursday.\n\n\u201cWhatever your sentence is is not going to stop corruption in Mexico,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cIt\u2019s how they do law enforcement in Mexico... It\u2019s not going to change.\u201d\n\nThe judge said he found parts of Arzate\u2019s statement \u201ctroubling.\u201d But he also said the government\u2019s recommended sentence of 10 years behind bars was \u201ctoo high.\u201d With time served since his arrest, Arzate could be eligible for release in just over a year.\n\nDEA agent Matthew Sandberg, who had worked with Arzate in Mexico, testified in a dry, matter-of-fact tone for most of his time one the stand. But his voice broke when he began to describe how leaks by Arzate \u2014 who he had once considered a friend \u2014 put the lives of agents like him and even their families in jeopardy.\n\n\u201cThat stuff can\u2019t happen unless there are corrupt officials,\u201d Sandberg said.\n\nLeaks to cartel kingpins by Arzate forced Americans to freeze their cooperation with Mexicans in some cases and to cut off relationships with some Mexican police officials as a precaution, as they scrambled to find the mole who turned out to be Arzate. Sandberg said about the ripple effects, including the distrust the incident fostered: \u201cIt was a real tragedy.\u201d\n\nBarragan, who is also known as \u201cKing Kong,\u201d told the court he had personally witnessed several murders, including that of an alleged turncoat executed in front of him by a cartel hitman.\n\nBarragan is serving a federal trafficking sentence after agreeing in a plea deal to cooperate with U.S. agents. He testified for nearly two hours Thursday in gray, pin-striped jail clothes.\n\nHe said it was common for cartels to have Mexican federal police on their illegal payrolls, often bribing them to steer police operations against competing cartels. Defense attorney Lopez asked him at one point if such payments went \u201call the way up the chain almost to the (Mexican) president.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Barragan answered. \u201cThat is how they do it.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Michael Tarm on Twitter at https://twitter.com/mtarm", "CONCORD, N.H.

(Andrew Jansen/The Springfield News-Leader via AP)\n\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) \u2014 The captain of a tourist boat that sank in southwest Missouri and killed 17 people, including nine members of an Indiana family, didn\u2019t tell passengers to put on flotation devices or prepare them to abandon ship even after waves crashed into the boat during a severe storm, according to an indictment released Thursday.\n\nThe federal indictment shows Kenneth Scott McKee faces 17 counts of misconduct, negligence or inattention to duty by a ship\u2019s officer resulting in death. The deaths occurred after the duck boat, a refurbished amphibious vessel originally used by the military during World War II, sank during a storm in July .\n\nU.S. Attorney Tim Garrison said the 51-year-old McKee also is accused of failing to properly assess the weather before and after the boat went into Table Rock Lake near Branson, a Midwestern tourist town known for country music shows and entertainment venues.\n\n\u201cThis is the beginning, not the end, of our efforts in this matter,\u201d Garrison said during a news conference in Springfield, adding that he couldn\u2019t release specifics about the investigation.\n\nA prosecutor says the indictment of the captain of a Missouri tourist boat that sank and killed 17 people marks \"the beginning but not the end\" of a federal prosecution in the case. (Nov. 11)\n\nRipley Entertainment, the company that operated the boats and suspended the operation following the accident, didn\u2019t respond to messages from The Associated Press. McKee\u2019s attorney declined comment.\n\nIf convicted, McKee could face up to 10 years in prison for each count and a fine of $250,000. Garrison said he expects McKee to surrender.\n\nTia Coleman \u2014 whose husband, three young children and five other family members died in the sinking \u2014 released a statement Thursday saying she was pleased an indictment had been filed. Coleman was among 14 people who survived the sinking.\n\n\u201cWhile nothing can ever ease the grief in my heart, I am grateful that the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office is fighting for justice for my family, and the other victims, and is committed to holding fully accountable all those responsible for this tragedy,\u201d Coleman said.\n\nThe other people killed included two couples from Missouri, an Illinois woman who died while saving her granddaughter\u2019s life, an Arkansas father and son, and a retired pastor who was the boat\u2019s operator on land.\n\nSeveral lawsuits have been filed on behalf of victims and survivors against Ripley Entertainment and other companies involved with the manufacture and operation of the boats. Robert Mongeluzzi, an attorney representing Coleman and several others, said he\u2019s confident the federal investigation will go beyond McKee.\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard had found probable cause that the accident resulted from McKee\u2019s \u201cmisconduct, negligence, or inattention to the duties,\u201d according to an August court filing. The U.S. attorney\u2019s office said the captain of a second duck boat that safely made it to shore during the storm acted in a \u201cgrossly negligent manner,\u201d though the court filing didn\u2019t elaborate on those findings.\n\nA spokeswoman for Ripley Entertainment has repeatedly declined to comment on the investigation but has said the company has cooperated with authorities.\n\nOn Thursday, Garrison said McKee violated conditions specified in the boat\u2019s certificate of inspection by failing to tell passengers to put on personal floatation devices and not immediately increasing speed and driving to the nearest shore, according to the indictment.\n\nThe indictment also alleges McKee allowed the boat\u2019s plastic side curtains to be lowered, which blocked the exits, and didn\u2019t instruct passengers to put on flotation devices or prepare them to abandon ship even after the bilge alarm sounded twice.\n\nThe vessel first took tourists on a trip through Branson, which is about 170 miles (274 kilometers) northwest of Little Rock, Arkansas. The amphibious vehicle then traveled to Table Rock Lake for a short excursion on water.\n\nWeather was calm when the vessel known as a Stretch Duck 7 began its trip on July 19, but investigators have contended that operators had ample warning that a strong storm was approaching.\n\nThe vessel\u2019s certificate of inspection issued by the Coast Guard in 2017 established rules and limitations on when it could be on the water. It states the boat \u201cshall not be operated waterborne\u201d when winds exceed 35 mph and/or wave heights exceed 2 feet.\n\nGarrison said McKee violated those limitations when he put the boat into the lake.\n\nVideo and audio from the boat, recovered by divers, showed that the lake was calm when the boat entered the water. But the weather suddenly turned violent. Within minutes, the boat sank.\n\nThe wind speed at the time of the accident was more than 70 mph, just short of hurricane force, according to the National Transportation Safety Board. Weather forecasts had warned of an impending storm with winds possibly exceeding 60 mph.\n\nThe wave height wasn\u2019t known, but cellphone video shot by passengers on a nearby excursion boat showed waves that appeared to be far greater than 2 feet (0.61 meters) high.\n\nIn addition to the weather, the Coast Guard has said it was looking into regulatory compliance of the boat and crew member duties and qualifications.\n\nBranson is among several places around the country where the amphibious vehicles offer excursions. Since 1999, 42 deaths have been associated with duck boat accidents .\n\nOn May 1, 1999, 13 people died when the Miss Majestic duck boat sank on Lake Hamilton near Hot Springs, Arkansas. In 2015, five college students died and more than 70 people were hurt when a duck boat veered into a charter bus on a bridge in Seattle. Two Hungarian tourists died in 2010 when a stalled duck boat was struck by a tugboat-guided barge on the Delaware River in Philadelphia.\n\nThe following message will be displayed to users with unsupported browsers: Your browser does not support the iframe HTML tag.

(AP Photo/Peter Dejong)\n\nUTRECHT, Netherlands (AP) \u2014 Self-styled positivity guru Emile Ratelband thinks age is just a number. And his is a number the Dutchman wants changed.\n\nThe 69-year-old TV personality has asked a court in the Netherlands to approve his request for a new birthday that officially would make him 49.\n\nRatelband says his legal appeal is consistent with other forms of personal transformation that are gaining acceptance and government recognition in the Netherlands and around the world.\n\n\u201cWith this free(dom) of choice, choice of name, freeness of gender, I want to have my own age.

He has also written and told journalists that he thinks of himself as black.\n\nHe says he was racially abused as a teenager because of his appearance, and when he started an acting career, he found it easier to pursue non-white parts. He also took an African middle name.\n\nNow some black artists are complaining because Lennon was recently given a paid traineeship in a program designed to give more black people a chance for careers in the arts.\n\nHis case resembles in some ways that of Rachel Dolezal, a white woman in the United States who identified herself as black after she was raised by religious parents who had adopted four black children.

Cindy Hyde-Smith will take part.\n\nDemocrat Mike Espy\u2019s campaign was reviewing \u201cterms and conditions\u201d before deciding whether to accept the group\u2019s invitation, campaign spokesman Danny Blanton said.\n\nEspy sent Hyde-Smith a letter Wednesday challenging her to three debates, although he did not mention specific dates, places or sponsors.\n\n\u201cThese debates should be moderated by a nonpartisan institution that can broadcast this information to the entire state,\u201d wrote Espy, a former congressman and former U.S. agriculture secretary.\n\nHyde-Smith was state agriculture commissioner when longtime Sen.

Stock says that the international police organization's rules forbid him from probing the fate of the man who served as Interpol president until two months ago when he vanished on a trip to China, his homeland. (AP Photo/Laurent Cipriani)\n\nLYON, France (AP) \u2014 Interpol\u2019s secretary general said Thursday that the international police organization\u2019s rules forbid him from probing into the fate of the Chinese government official who served as Interpol president for almost two years before he vanished during a trip to China.\n\nIn his first public remarks about the disappearance of Meng Hongwei, Interpol Secretary General Juergen Stock said he \u201cencouraged\u201d Chinese authorities to provide information about Meng\u2019s location and legal status but can do no more.\n\nStock spoke to journalists as Interpol member prepare to elect a new president to replace Meng during a general assembly in Dubai on Nov. 18-21. Meng became the organization\u2019s president in November 2016.\n\nChinese authorities said they detained Meng, 64, on bribery charges, though his wife has described him as a victim of political persecution. He was China\u2019s vice minister of public security and appears to be the latest ranking Chinese official to have been caught in a sweeping purge under President Xi Jinping.\n\nStock said his organization learned of Meng\u2019s disappearance on Oct. 5 via media reports that came out after Meng\u2019s wife said she had not heard from him since the end of September and reported him missing.\n\nInterpol contacted Beijing, asking for clarification, according to Stock. A high-level Chinese delegation arrived at Interpol\u2019s Lyon headquarters on Oct. 7, reported that Meng had written a resignation letter and advised that he was no longer a delegate from China to Interpol \u2014 meaning he could no longer serve as president.\n\nChina\u2019s Interpol office transmitted the resignation letter to Interpol headquarters later that day. Pressed on whether Interpol had assurances Meng actually wrote it or did so without duress, Stock hedged.\n\n\u201cThere was no reason for me to (suspect) that anything was forced or wrong,\u201d he said.\n\nInterpol appeared to accept the Chinese delegation\u2019s explanation at face value and publicly announced that night that Meng had stepped down, without commenting on why or what happened.\n\nStock cited the structure and nature of the 192-member organization, which provides a platform for member nations to share information on criminal activities, and the vast needs it fulfills in trying to contain ballooning transnational crime. Interpol databases are queried 200 times each second by police around the world, he said.\n\n\u201cWe are a rules-based organization. That is very important to understand,\u201d Stock said, adding that the role of Interpol is \u201cnot to govern over member states.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are not an investigative body,\u201d he said.\n\nStock said he is in \u201cconstant\u201d contact with the national central bureau in Beijing that serves as Interpol\u2019s point of contact in China. As secretary general, Stock manages Interpol\u2019s day-to-day activities, while the agency\u2019s elected president has a less hands-on, more symbolic role.\n\n\u201cWe are strongly encouraging China\u201d to come forth with details of Meng\u2019s case, Stock said. He suggested Chinese officials would \u201cwhen the right moment comes.\u201d\n\nMeng\u2019s wife, Grace Meng, told The Associated Press last month that she received threats after her husband disappeared. She and their two children are under police protection in Lyon.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt this is a very regrettable situation,\u201d Stock said. \u201cBut on the other hand, we have to ensure day-to-day operations ... continue.\u201d\n\nHe also conceded that Interpol must \u201cmitigate negative impact\u201d springing from Meng\u2019s disappearance.\n\nInterpol acts as a clearinghouse for national police services that want to hunt down suspects outside their borders. Governments have repeatedly tried to use Interpol to find political enemies, even though its charter explicitly proclaims its neutrality and prohibits use of police notices for political reasons.\n\nStock said that ensuring the notices are not misused has been one of his priorities.", "NASHVILLE, Tenn.

A wind-whipped fire north of Los Angeles in Ventura County burned up to 15 square miles and at least one home in a matter of hours.

SafeSport has an 800-case backlog and an average of 85 complaints each month. @epells: https://t.co/NyAzCrYQPr pic.twitter.com/vzVyy0q8nC \u2014 AP Sports (@AP_Sports) November 8, 2018\n\nSafeSport\u2019s mission is to investigate cases and serve as an independent clearinghouse for educating about abuse, with the authority to ban athletes and coaches across organizations that run Olympic sports in the United States. It is backed by the U.S. Olympic Committee, which took steps to decertify USA Gymnastics this week for botching an organizational rebuild following the sexual abuse scandal involving now-imprisoned team doctor Larry Nassar.\n\nTo be sure, the money \u2014 SafeSport will use $1 million in the first year, $875,000 in Year 2 and $378,000 in Year 3 \u2014 represents a significant infusion for an office operating on $6.4 million in 2018. But according to the rules of the Justice Department grant awarded last month, it must all be directed toward prevention and education programs, and for auditing national governing bodies\u2019 work in sex-abuse prevention \u2014 not the most acute needs for an operation that has struggled to hire investigators to look into the 1,622 complaints, an average of 85 a month, that have come its way.\n\nThe backlog is growing steadily, with spikes coming whenever sex-abuse and assault cases make big headlines.\n\nNot long after opening, when the #MeToo movement and Nassar allegations were in the headlines, the number of reports coming into the center rose from 20 to 30 a month to that same number each week. Over the two weeks that Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation topped the news because of sexual assault allegations that he denies, the center received 135 calls.\n\nThe center has 14 employees on its response and resolution team, including six full-time investigators and another dozen who work on a contract basis. According to numbers provided by the center, full-time investigators handle an average of 10 active cases at any given time and the contractors handle between three and six. That means no more than 132 of the 800-plus cases are being investigated at any given time.\n\nThe $2.2 million grant won\u2019t help resolve any of those manpower issues.\n\nText of SafeSport\u2019s grant from the Justice Department.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at all kinds of strategies of knocking down that backlog,\u201d Pfohl said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just throwing bodies at the workload. It\u2019s also being very strategic about the type of people we\u2019re hiring who can help folks from the time they call us to submit a report.\u201d\n\nThe Senate subcommittee hearings being chaired by Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kansas, may lead to revisiting the law that formed the USOC, potentially reshaping the relationship between the USOC and the 50 national governing bodies it oversees. More stringent language about handling sex-abuse cases could be added.\n\nA spokeswoman for Moran said the panel is reviewing whether the center needs additional resources but could not explain the reason the grant was written the way it was.\n\n\u201cSenator Moran ... is uniquely positioned to address resource-related concerns as appropriate,\u201d said spokeswoman Morgan Said. Lawmakers are looking for other ways to fund the center, she said.\n\nThe U.S. Olympic Committee provides $3.1 million a year for SafeSport. Earlier this year, the organizations that run Olympic sports in America (national governing bodies) doubled their contributions to $2 million total per year in 2019, which at the time increased SafeSport\u2019s overall budget by about 25 percent.\n\nWhen the USOC pushed to open the center amid growing outrage over slow responses to scandals in swimming, taekwondo and other sports, it searched for funding across the sports landscape \u2014 from pro leagues to the NCAA and elsewhere \u2014 but found few backers. The relative dearth of cash flow has slowed the center\u2019s mission.\n\nSince its opening, SafeSport investigations have led to 381 disciplinary actions, including 222 cases that led to permanent ineligibility.\n\nThe discipline is similar to what the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency does on the drug front.\n\nBy comparison, USADA, which also must fund a robust testing system, reported $21 million in revenue in 2017, $9.5 million of which came from a grant from the federal Office of National Drug Control Policy and another $5.1 million of which came from the USOC. There were no significant strings attached to USADA\u2019s government grant.\n\n(The USOC, chastened by critics for not reacting strongly enough to the Russian doping scandal, increased USADA funding by about 35 percent from 2016. Under similar criticism, it has doubled its outlay to the SafeSport Center since the opening.)\n\nEarlier this year, Congress passed a bill requiring that the USOC and sports federations under its umbrella report abuse allegations to law enforcement.

(AP) \u2014 Five Arkansas residents have filed a lawsuit to challenge whether a large part of funding can be spent on a $630 million project to improve the Interstate 30 corridor through Little Rock and North Little Rock.\n\nThe lawsuit filed Wednesday contends that Connecting Arkansas Program money can\u2019t be spent on Interstate 30 because it\u2019s a six-lane highway, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported. The lawsuit argues that Amendment 91, which governs the money spent under Connecting Arkansas, limits the program to only fund improvements to four-lane highways or two-lane highways that are widened to four lanes.\n\nVoters in 2012 approved Amendment 91, which increased the state sales tax by half a percent for 10 years to help fund the Connecting Arkansas Program. The program funds regionally significant highway projects and is contributing about $448 million for the I-30 project.\n\nBut the lawsuit contends that the I-30 project, which widens a six-lane highway to 10 lanes, doesn\u2019t meet the amendment standards to receive the program\u2019s sales-tax proceeds.\n\n\u201cAs the 30 Crossing is proposed right now, I\u2019m not saying the Highway Department can\u2019t get funds from somewhere else, but they can\u2019t use the funds they are currently using through the Connecting Arkansas Program,\u201d said attorney Justin Zachary, who filed the lawsuit on behalf of the five residents. The lead plaintiff, Richard Mason, is a geologist, developer and a former president of the Arkansas Wildlife Federation.\n\nThe lawsuit also claims that Amendment 91 prohibits the proceeds from being spent on an ongoing project to widen part of Interstate 630 in Little Rock from six lanes to eight lanes. The Connecting Arkansas Program is contributing about $58 million to the I-630 project, according to court documents.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks a judgment that spending the sales-tax proceeds on the projects is unconstitutional, and requests any money spent on the projects to be returned.\n\nThe lawsuit names as defendants five members of the Arkansas Highway Commission; Arkansas Transportation Department Director Scott Bennett; state Treasurer Dennis Milligan; state Auditor Andrea Lee; Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration Director Larry Walther; and Gov.

That will now be optional, so workers can choose to sue in court and present their case in front of a jury. It mirrors a change made by ride-hailing service Uber after complaints from its female employees prompted an internal investigation. The probe concluded that its rank had been poisoned by rampant sexual harassment.\n\n\u201cGoogle\u2019s leaders and I have heard your feedback and have been moved by the stories you\u2019ve shared,\u201d CEO Sundar Pichai said in an email to Google employees. \u201cWe recognize that we have not always gotten everything right in the past and we are sincerely sorry for that. It\u2019s clear we need to make some changes.\u201d Thursday\u2019s email was obtained by The Associated Press.\n\nLast week, the tech giant\u2019s workers left their cubicles in dozens of offices around the world to protest what they consider management\u2019s lax treatment of top executives and other male workers accused of sexual harassment and other misconduct. The protest\u2019s organizers estimated that about 20,000 workers participated.\n\nThe reforms are the latest fallout from a broader societal backlash against men\u2019s exploitation of their female subordinates in business, entertainment and politics \u2014 a movement that has spawned the \u201cMeToo\u201d hashtag as a sign of unity and a call for change.\n\nGoogle will provide more details about sexual misconduct cases in internal reports available to all employees. The breakdowns will include the number of cases that were substantiated within various company departments and list the types of punishment imposed, including firings, pay cuts and mandated counseling.\n\nThe company is also stepping up its training aimed at preventing misconduct. It\u2019s requiring all employees to go through the process annually instead of every other year. Those who fall behind in their training, including top executives, will be dinged in annual performance reviews, leaving a blemish that could lower their pay and make it more difficult to get promoted.\n\nBut Google didn\u2019t address protesters\u2019 demand for a commitment to pay women the same as men doing similar work. When previously confronted with accusations that it shortchanges women \u2014 made by the U.S. Labor Department and in lawsuits filed by female employees \u2014Google has maintained that its compensation system doesn\u2019t discriminate between men and women.\n\nThe changes didn\u2019t go far enough to satisfy Vicki Tardif Holland, a Google employee who helped organize and spoke at the protests near the company\u2019s Cambridge, Massachusetts, office last week.\n\n\u201cWhile Sundar\u2019s message was encouraging, important points around discrimination, inequity and representation were not addressed,\u201d Holland wrote in an email responding to an AP inquiry.\n\nNevertheless, employment experts predicted the generally positive outcome of Google\u2019s mass uprising is bound to have ripple effects across Silicon Valley and perhaps the rest of corporate America.\n\n\u201cThese things can be contagious,\u201d said Thomas Kochan, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology management professor specializing in employment issues. \u201cI would expect to see other professionals taking action when they see something wrong.\u201d\n\nSome employers might even pre-emptively adopt some of Google\u2019s new policies, given its prestige, said Stephanie Creary, who specializes in workplace and diversity issues at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School. \u201cWhen Google does something, other employers tend to copy it,\u201d she said.\n\nGoogle got caught in the crosshairs two weeks ago after The New York Times detailed allegations of sexual misconduct against the creator of Google\u2019s Android software, Andy Rubin. The newspaper said Rubin received a $90 million severance package in 2014 after Google concluded the accusations were credible. Rubin has denied the allegations.\n\nLike its Silicon Valley peers, Google has already acknowledged that its workforce is too heavily concentrated with white and Asian men, especially in the highest-paying executive and computer-programming jobs. Women account for 31 percent of Google\u2019s employees worldwide, and it\u2019s lower for leadership roles.\n\nCritics believe that gender imbalance has created a \u201cbrogammer\u201d culture akin to a college fraternity house that treats women as sex objects. As part of its ongoing efforts, Google will now require at least one woman or a non-Asian ethnic minority to be included on the list of candidates for executive jobs.\n\n___\n\nAP Technology Writer Frank Bajak in Boston contributed to this story.", "Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev attends the Moscow premier of a film made by Werner Herzog and British filmmaker Andre Singer based on their conversations, in Moscow, Russia, Thursday, Nov. 8, 2018.

Hackers are impersonating reporters in a bid to intercept the communications of the prominent Saudi opposition figure in Washington. An Associated Press review of malicious emails sent to AlAhmed shows he was approached by hackers masquerading as a BBC reporter and as Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, who was killed last month at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. The emails were attempts to break into AlAhmed\u2019s inbox. AlAhmed blames the Saudi government for the hacking campaign, although the AP has yet to find any forensic evidence to back that.(AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Hackers impersonating journalists tried to intercept the communications of a prominent Saudi opposition figure in Washington, The Associated Press has found.\n\nOne attempt involved the fabrication of a fake BBC secretary and an elaborate television interview request; the other involved the impersonation of slain Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi to deliver a malicious link.\n\nMedia rights defenders denounced the hacking effort, which they said would make it harder for genuine reporters to do their jobs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly dangerous to employ this kind of tactic,\u201d said Elodie Vialle, who heads the technology desk at Paris-based Reporters Without Borders. \u201cThe chilling effect is that people are deterred from speaking to journalists. In the end, it undermines the freedom of information.\u201d\n\nThe most involved masquerade took place in February of this year, when someone posing as a BBC journalist called \u201cTanya Stalin\u201d emailed Washington-based Saudi dissident Ali AlAhmed inviting him to a live broadcast about Saudi Arabia. Stalin engaged with AlAhmed over several days, sending him a list of proposed topics and talking him through the logistics of his purported television appearance.\n\nAlAhmed said he knew from the beginning that something was up.\n\nFor starters, Stalin said her position was \u201cSecretary to the Editor In Chief,\u201d a title that didn\u2019t correspond to a job typically done by producers or bookers. Odder still, the message came over Gmail rather than from an official BBC address.\n\nAnd then there was her eyebrow-raising last name.\n\n\u201cThe Stalin business threw me off,\u201d AlAhmed said in a recent interview. \u201cI asked my wife, who is Russian, and she said: \u2018No one has this name.\u2019\u201d\n\nAlAhmed was right. The BBC said it wasn\u2019t aware of anyone called \u201cTanya Stalin\u201d working for the broadcaster and that the title she claimed to hold did not formally exist. An Associated Press analysis of her messages suggests the interview request was a sloppily executed trap, an attempt to get AlAhmed to click a malicious link and break into his inbox.\n\nAlAhmed believes Saudi Arabia is behind Stalin\u2019s emails, as well as dozens of other suspicious messages he has received over the past year. One November 2017 missive purportedly came from Khashoggi, whose killing last month on the grounds of the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul has refocused international attention on the brutality of the Arab kingdom\u2019s leadership.\n\nThe Saudi Embassy in Washington did not return written questions from the AP.\n\nWashington Post Executive Editor Marty Baron said the hackers\u2019 theft of Khashoggi\u2019s identity was \u201ccontemptible.\u201d\n\nA researcher with internet watchdog Citizen Lab recently reviewed AlAhmed\u2019s emails and confirmed they were malicious \u2014 although he stopped short of drawing a link between the different messages or blaming anyone for the hacking campaign.\n\n\u201cThis was a targeted operation designed to gain access to his accounts and private communications,\u201d said John Scott-Railton, whose group is based at the University of Toronto\u2019s Munk School of Global Affairs. \u201cThis does appear to be closely linked to his political activities.\u201d\n\nSome of the messages \u2014 like a prompt to install a \u201cfree security update\u201d called \u201cNinja security\u201d \u2014 were generic phishing messages of the type used by criminals and spies the world over. But many of the 40-odd malicious messages recovered from AlAhmed\u2019s inbox were closely attuned to current events in the Gulf.\n\nMost troubling was a May 31 message dressed up to look like it came from an event photography service, complete with pictures of AlAhmed holding a microphone during a question and answer session featuring the Qatari foreign minister at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington.\n\nThe photos, which appear to have been pulled off a publicly available video of the event, suggest that the hackers or someone working with them had been tracking AlAhmed\u2019s whereabouts closely.\n\n\u201cThat email was really when I felt fear,\u201d said AlAhmed, who says his work is largely self-funded. \u201cThey are actually physically here. They\u2019re looking at me.\u201d\n\nScott-Railton said the persistence of the hackers \u2014 and the variety of different tactics they employed to try to pry open AlAhmed\u2019s inbox \u2014 pointed to a manpower-intensive effort to compromise the Saudi gadfly.\n\n\u201cOver an extended period of time, humans were tasked with getting into his computer and getting into his head,\u201d Scott-Railton said.\n\nAs a critic of Saudi Arabia\u2019s ruling family, AlAhmed has been a regular on Arabic and English-language cable news for more than a decade. He has long served Washington journalists as a source about the kingdom\u2019s problems, especially in relation to extremist propaganda in the country\u2019s school textbooks.\n\nSaudi Arabia is a known practitioner of cyberespionage. The country was exposed as a customer of notorious Italian surveillance firm Hacking Team in 2015 and a mysterious Saudi investor has since taken a minority stake in the company, according to a Motherboard report published this year.\n\nRecent reports by Citizen Lab and human rights group Amnesty International have also documented the use of Israeli-made spy software to break into the smartphones of Saudi human rights activists, including Canada-based Omar Abdulaziz, who was working with Khashoggi on several confidential projects before the columnist was killed.\n\nWhoever is behind the bogus Tanya Stalin persona or the fake Jamal Khashoggi emails, the messages give an idea of how the always-fraught overlap between espionage and journalism has evolved in the internet age, with government-backed hackers routinely impersonating journalists or news organizations to hunt their prey. Even the FBI has impersonated reporters to hack its targets, at one point pretending to be an AP journalist to locate a bomb threat hoaxer\u2019s computer.\n\nScott-Railton explained that masquerading as a journalist was a perfect way of getting someone to lower their guard and click a link or open an attachment.\n\n\u201cIt ticks all kinds of boxes,\u201d he said. \u201cIt explains messages out of the blue and as part of communications with journalists you\u2019d expect to receive documents, like questions in advance.\u201d\n\nThe attempt to hack AlAhmed under Khashoggi\u2019s name involved a simple link sent by email , but the Tanya Stalin ruse was unusually involved.\n\nThe hackers created a fake LinkedIn profile with more than 500 connections to corroborate her identity and pass her off as a graduate of journalism schools at Columbia and Berkeley. The profile\u2019s picture consisted of a headshot of Souad Mekhennet, a real Washington Post journalist who writes about national security and the Middle East and has covered the aftermath of Khashoggi\u2019s death.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear why the hackers used Mekhennet\u2019s photo in the sham profile or whether they even tried particularly hard to make the \u201cTanya Stalin\u201d persona credible. Stalin did not immediately return messages seeking comment. Neither did whoever was behind the fake Khashoggi email.\n\nBaron, the Washington Post\u2019s top editor, said in his statement Wednesday that he condemned the use of Mekhennet\u2019s image and Khashoggi\u2019s name.\n\n\u201cTo be clear, neither of these distinguished journalists had any involvement whatsoever in these despicable schemes,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nOnline:\n\nRaphael Satter can be reached at: http://raphaelsatter.com\n\n___\n\nA selection of the phishing emails sent to Ali AlAhmed: https://www.documentcloud.org/search/projectid:41381-Fake-Journalist-Hackers", "FILE - In this Sept. 15, 2018, file photo, Notre Dame quarterback Brandon Wimbush looks to throw against Vanderbilt during the first half of an NCAA college football game in South Bend, Ind.

He is completing 74.5 percent of his passes, tops in the FBS, for 1,824 yards, with 15 touchdowns and four interceptions. With Book starting, the Fighting Irish have averaged 38 points per game. They averaged 23.3 in Wimbush\u2019s three starts. Notre Dame is 12-3 in games Wimbush has started the past two seasons.\n\n\u201cTo have a guy like that who, first of all, our players just really respect and are excited if he has the opportunity to play.

We\u2019ve got a pretty good defense.\u201d\n\nWimbush, a senior, was the starter last season for the Irish, but his inconsistent and inaccurate passing led to Kelly switch to Book. Wimbush has completed 50.8 percent for his career, with 17 touchdowns and 10 interceptions.

(AP) \u2014 Seven Roman Catholic dioceses in Pennsylvania said Thursday that they have taken steps to set up victim compensation funds, nearly three months after a chilling grand jury report documented decades of child sexual abuse by priests in the state.\n\nThe Philadelphia, Harrisburg, Scranton and Allentown dioceses issued public announcements, and a lawyer for the Greensburg Diocese said it is also involved. The Erie and Pittsburgh dioceses said they were setting up funds but were not ready to disclose details. Altoona-Johnstown said it set up a victim fund in 1999.\n\nThe announcements did not mention a total dollar amount for the funds or their maximum potential individual payouts.\n\nFive of the dioceses have hired veteran compensation fund coordinator Ken Feinberg to design and operate their programs. The Philadelphia fund will begin taking applications next week, setting a filing deadline for claims at the end of next September, said Camille Biros, Feinberg\u2019s co-administrator. Harrisburg, Erie, Greensburg and Scranton are expected to begin their programs in January, she said.\n\nIn statements, the dioceses described sources for the money, including borrowing, property sales, investments and insurers.\n\n\u201cFor the most part, they\u2019re telling us, \u2018We want to get this done, so whatever it takes to get these resolved,\u2019\u201d Biros said.\n\nPayouts and total fund amounts will not be disclosed by the dioceses, and church officials will have no say in decisions about eligibility or payout amounts, she said.\n\nA legislative effort to change state law to allow a two-year window for people to sue in abuse cases that are otherwise too old to pursue passed the state House, but it was blocked by Republican state senators last month. Opponents, including Catholic bishops and the insurance industry, expressed concerns about the cost and argued that a retroactive change would violate the state constitution.\n\nRep. Mark Rozzi, a Berks County Democrat and leading advocate for the lawsuit window, said negotiations have continued and he sees a possibility of a deal by year\u2019s end.\n\n\u201cAnd if not, we\u2019re going to be back at it next year,\u201d Rozzi said.\n\nThe landmark grand jury report released in August estimated hundreds of priests in Pennsylvania molested more than 1,000 children since the 1940s.\n\nState Attorney General Josh Shapiro, whose office oversaw the investigation, said lawmakers should enact the window along with other changes to state law that the jury recommended \u2014 eliminating time limits on criminal prosecutions for sexual abuse of children, clarify penalties for failing to report child abuse and banning confidentiality agreements that prevent victims from speaking with law enforcement.\n\nShapiro said the grand jury \u201crecommended that victims deserve their day in court \u2014 not that the church should be the arbiter of its own punishment. These undefined compensation funds do not give a pass to lawmakers \u2014 the Legislature should return to Harrisburg, do their jobs and pass the grand jury\u2019s four reforms.\u201d\n\nThe announcements come as the chief federal prosecutor in Philadelphia has begun investigating whether Pennsylvania diocese officials broke any federal child exploitation laws.\n\nBen Andreozzi, a lawyer who represents dozens of people in each of Pennsylvania\u2019s eight dioceses who claim to have been abused by priests, said such funds can be helpful. But, he said, they can also avoid full disclosure of what occurred, do not help victims whose abuse had nothing to do with the Catholic Church and typically deliver less money to a victim than a lawsuit.\n\n\u201cThe biggest drawback in a fund like this is that it does not force the institution to come clean with all the information that it has regarding the abuse,\u201d Andreozzi said. \u201cAnd oftentimes the victims don\u2019t get fair market value for their claims.\u201d\n\nFeinberg and Biros ran victims\u2019 compensation funds set up by five New York dioceses in recent years. They put no cap on payouts, but $500,000 is the most paid out to one individual, Biros said. Factors to determine the size of the payouts included the severity of the abuse, the age of the victim and the long-term effect on the victim\u2019s life.\n\n\u201cI think that the programs in New York have been very well received, and we\u2019re hoping the same will be true for the Pennsylvania dioceses,\u201d Biros said.\n\nThe Philadelphia Archdiocese said its program would be overseen by a three-person committee, including former U.S. Sen. George Mitchell of Maine, former interim Philadelphia District Attorney Kelley Hodge and Lawrence Stengel, a retired federal judge. It plans to sell properties but will not dip into money for charities, seminaries, donor-designated gifts or donations to parishes, ministries or schools.\n\nAllentown, which has not hired Feinberg, said an independent board will oversee an administrator\u2019s decision about compensation. It plans to announce a timetable and other details shortly. Erie said its fund parameters were being finalized.\n\nHarrisburg said its program will be funded by its reserve, unrestricted accounts, investments and its insurers. Scranton said its fund will be paid with reserves and it will sell assets and borrow money. A lawyer for Greensburg said it planned to release details.\n\nPittsburgh said it will outline its program by the end of the year, and Bishop David Zubik recently scheduled \u201clistening sessions\u201d around the diocese to help determine how the program will operate. Biros said the Feinberg team has been in talks with the Pittsburgh diocese about possibly operating its program.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press reporter Marc Levy in Harrisburg contributed to this report.", "LANSING, Mich. (AP) \u2014 Outgoing Gov. Rick Snyder said Thursday that his top remaining legislative priorities include pushing through trash and water fee increases to pay for environmental cleanup, infrastructure and recycling needs \u2014 proposals that a top lawmaker said continue to concern many Republicans.\n\nThe term-limited governor, who met with GOP lawmakers who control the Legislature, said he expects a \u201cbusy\u201d lame-duck session \u2014 the post-election period before new lawmakers and, in this case, a Democratic governor takes over in January. Republican Senate Majority Leader Arlan Meekhof, meanwhile, signaled his plans to scale back recently enacted laws that will raise the minimum wage and require employers to provide earned sick leave \u2014 moves that Democrats said would thwart the intent of voters.\n\nAt the top of Snyder\u2019s list is raising the landfill dumping fee and imposing a new state fee on water customers. Two key business groups got behind the proposals in the summer, but they could be difficult to pass in the Legislature.\n\n\u201cA lot of folks in my caucus that were opposed are still opposed,\u201d Meekhof said. \u201cIt looks not very likely, but it is lame duck.\u201d\n\nHe listed as a priority Senate-passed auto insurance bills that would make changes such as letting older drivers avoid paying most of a mandatory fee that covers unlimited medical benefits. And he said he wants to make the minimum wage and sick time laws, which began as ballot initiatives and were adopted by lawmakers in September to make it easier to change them, \u201cmore acceptable to the business community.\u201d\n\nHe cited concerns that workers will be able to use a sick day without giving enough warning to their employer. The restaurant lobby is opposed to a provision in the wage measure that will increase the minimum for tipped employees until it reaches the minimum for all other workers in 2024.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Jim Ananich said Democrats will oppose any \u201cshenanigans\u201d to water down the laws, saying the public supports a higher minimum wage and mandatory sick days. He pointed to this week\u2019s election, when Gretchen Whitmer was elected governor and Democrats took other top offices while cutting into GOP legislative majorities.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hopeful that they sort of read the tea leaves and realize that that\u2019s a mistake to do, and we\u2019ll hold them accountable for it if they do,\u201d Ananich said.\n\nIf Snyder\u2019s fee proposals are approved, the additional revenue would be used to clean up contaminated sites, address perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances \u2014 known as PFAS \u2014 that have tainted drinking water supplies, boost asbestos removal and provide recycling grants. The \u201ctipping\u201d fee would replace the Clean Michigan Initiative, a 20-year-old voter-approved bond issue that is drying up.\n\nSnyder has said the landfill fee would cost households no more than about $4 a year, while the water fee would be capped at no more than $20 annually per household and $400 per business.\n\nHe said he also wants to enact a supplemental spending bill, declining to elaborate except to say he could seek to spend more on the PFAS contamination. He did not mention recently enacted laws to raise the minimum wage and require earned sick leave, which business organizations want to scale back.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always had a list,\u201d Snyder said. \u201cSo at this point, I\u2019m waiting to see what their priorities are, and let\u2019s merge them together to see what we can accomplish.\u201d\n\nAnother legislative issue that could come up before year\u2019s end might be the implementation of an agreement between Snyder\u2019s administration and Canadian pipeline giant Enbridge to replace twin 65-year-old crude oil pipes that critics have long described as an environmental disaster waiting to happen in a crucial Great Lakes channel. The plan calls for decommissioning the pipes after installing a new line in a tunnel to be drilled beneath the Straits of Mackinac.\n\n___\n\nFollow David Eggert on Twitter at https://twitter.com/DavidEggert00 .

(AP Photo/Martha Bellisle, File)\n\nSEATTLE (AP) \u2014 A nurse at Washington state\u2019s troubled psychiatric hospital who lost part of her ear when she was assaulted by a patient is suing the state for $5 million, claiming officials are to blame for failing to adequately staff shifts and by placing violent patients on less-secure wards.\n\n\u201cShe was exposed to egregious work environment,\u201d Tacoma lawyer James Beck said Thursday of nurse Bernia Garner. \u201d\u201cShe had a spinal fracture from the attack. Her mobilization is seriously impacted by all of this.\u201d\n\nAt the time of the Sept. 30 attack, Garner was the only registered nurse on duty, despite Western State Hospital\u2019s policy that requires three RNs per shift, Beck said. The patient, Christopher Adams Jones, had a history of assaulting and being sexually aggressive with female staff, but the hospital failed to implement measures to protect workers from his violent behavior, Beck said.\n\nJones was arrested and charged with assaulting Garner. His court-appointed lawyer, Laura Carnell, said she is unable to comment on the case \u201cas it is an ongoing criminal case.\u201d\n\nDepartment of Social and Health Services spokeswoman Kelly Stowe said the agency doesn\u2019t comment on pending litigation.\n\nThe attack on Garner was one of several in recent months, including two separate incidents where patients knocked staff down and stomped on their heads.\n\nThe hospital has been plagued by problems for years and was repeatedly cited for health and safety violations, including escapes by violent patients. One man sent to the hospital after he was found incompetent to stand trial on a murder charge for tying up a woman with electrical cords, stabbing her 24 times and slashing her throat, slipped out of a window in 2016. He was caught two days later, 300 miles away in Spokane. An Associated Press investigation discovered 185 instances of patients who went missing over a three-year period.\n\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services finally cut the hospital\u2019s certification and $53 million federal funds earlier this year due to continued failed inspections.\n\nGarner, 63, was working behind the nurse\u2019s station when the patient jumped over the counter, knocked her to the ground and bit her ear lobe off.\n\nPrior to being moved to Ward S-7, the patient had attacked other female employees, Beck said.\n\n\u201cThere was a mental health technician, Eloisa Panza, who was assaulted by the patient when he knocked her hard to the ground and tried to bite her thigh,\u201d the lawsuit said. Panza had to take three weeks off due to injuries suffered in the July 23 attack, but the hospital didn\u2019t make needed changes to protect other workers from the patient, the suit said.\n\n\u201cTo my knowledge, Western State Hospital did not file any police report with regard to my attack by the same individual that later assaulted Bernia Garner,\u201d Panza said in a statement filed in support of Garner\u2019s claim.\n\nAfter returning to work, Panza said the patient continued his inappropriate behavior and on one occasion before the ear-biting incident, grabbed Garner\u2019s arm.\n\n\u201cBernia Garner was able to get away, but this was very distrustful for me to see occur and brought back the fear I had from my prior July attack,\u201d she said.\n\nNursing supervisor Willie Saw also wrote a statement supporting the claim.\n\n\u201cI am very concerned about the violence happening at the hospital right now,\u201d he said, \u201cand while I feel vulnerable as well, I am especially concerned for my female coworkers.\u201d", "Jailed mayoral candidate gets less than 13 percent of votes\n\nHOLDREGE, Neb.

(Greene County Sheriff Office via AP)\n\nSPRINGFIELD, Mo. (AP) \u2014 A man who federal authorities believe is in the U.S. illegally has been charged in the fatal shooting of two former roommates and a woman whose home he moved into after his first victims threw him out, police in southwestern Missouri said. A second man has been charged as an accomplice.\n\nPolice said in charging documents that Luis Perez opened fire on Steven Marler, 38, and Aaron Hampton, 23, at their home in Springfield on Nov. 1. Two other people were wounded but survived. Perez then shot and killed Sabrina Starr, 21, a day later at her house, the documents say. The 23-year-old suspect faces eight other felony counts in the shootings.\n\nAaron Anderson, 19, told investigators that he was waiting with Starr in an SUV outside Hampton and Marler\u2019s home when Perez shot them. Anderson said he was on the phone with Perez at the time and that he could hear the victims \u201cbegging for their lives.\u201d\n\nAnderson was charged as an accomplice with two counts of first-degree murder in those killings and three other felonies.\n\nAfter the first shootings, Anderson, Perez and Starr drove to Starr\u2019s home, and police said she was shot six times there on Friday. A relative found her body the following day. No other details of that killing have been revealed.\n\nThe probable cause statement doesn\u2019t list a motive in any of the shootings, although Perez and Anderson had recently been kicked out of Hampton and Marler\u2019s home. A witness identified by the initials K.M. told police Perez said after the shootings that \u201cthey had to go\u201d because \u201cthey knew too much,\u201d court documents say.\n\nSpringfield police homicide detective Scott Hill said in charging documents that Perez had recently arrived in Springfield from New Jersey, and that his immigration status was in question.\n\n\u201cI checked Luis Perez criminal history and it showed he had active warrants out of the state of New Jersey. The criminal history also showed Perez was not a U.S. citizen. Contact was made with federal authorities who confirmed they would detain Perez if contacted due to him being illegal,\u201d Hill said.\n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesman Shawn Neudauer said in an email that the agency is reviewing its records and plans to issue a statement once that review is complete.\n\nPolice obtained a warrant to search several Facebook accounts and found messages from Perez after the killings indicating he was trying to trade a handgun. Perez called it a \u201cdirty\u201d handgun because it \u201cGot bodies,\u201d the charging documents said.\n\nAnderson told police a stolen gun was used in the killings. Charging documents say Starr had recently given Perez a stolen gun in exchange for a tattoo, but police haven\u2019t said that gun was used in any of the killings.\n\nTwo Glock 9mm magazines were found in a detached garage of the home where Starr\u2019s body was found. Shell casings at her home matched the 9mm shell casings from the home where the men were killed.\n\nPerez and Anderson are jailed without bond in Greene County. No attorneys are listed for them in online court records.\n\nPolice also said Perez\u2019s girlfriend, Dalia Garcia, arrived on a bus from New Jersey on Friday and helped to burn evidence. She was charged with tampering with evidence and jailed on $75,000 bond.", "COLUMBIA, Mo.

The jury ruled that Aetna recklessly disregarded its duty to deal fairly and in good faith with Cunningham, who had nasopharyngeal cancer.\n\nAetna is considering whether to appeal the ruling, which was issued this week.

Two other in-house doctors reviewed and upheld the decision.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration had approved proton beam therapy, which is also a treatment covered by Medicare, according to Doug Terry, the family\u2019s attorney. He alleged that Aetna denied coverage for financial reasons and that its doctors were unqualified, overworked and biased when making decisions. Court records show that one doctor complained to the insurer about having to review more than 80 cases a day.\n\nAfter she was denied coverage, Cunningham and her husband decided to mortgage their home in Meeker, about 35 miles (56 kilometers) east of Oklahoma City, to pay for the therapy in Texas. She died in May 2015 at age 54.\n\n\u201cMy wife, her goal, was to make this fight,\u201d Ron Cunningham said. \u201cHer comment was, \u2018If we can save one person and stop Aetna from doing what they traditionally do on every claim, it was worth the battle.\u2019\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Oklahoman, http://www.newsok.com", "Click to copy\n\nClick to copy https://apnews.com/ceac6e75f67d4c74ad5bac649cb7ec09", "This photo provided by the FBI shows Hania Noelia Aguilar.

Schneiderman said in a statement he didn't consider the decision an exoneration. He also apologized \"for any and all pain that I have caused.\" (AP Photo/Mary Altaffer, File)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The special prosecutor investigating former New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said Thursday that she couldn\u2019t bring criminal charges over allegations he physically abused women he dated, in part, because current state law doesn\u2019t explicitly outlaw such behavior.\n\nIn closing the six-month investigation, Nassau County District Attorney Madeline Singas implored lawmakers to pass legislation to criminalize slapping, shoving and other violence committed for sexual gratification.\n\nSingas, who was appointed to conduct the investigation by Gov. Andrew Cuomo in May, said investigators conducted an \u201cexhaustive review\u201d and that she personally interviewed each woman who had accused Schneiderman of assault. Investigators also spoke with members of Schneiderman\u2019s security detail and people who worked for him in the attorney general\u2019s office, she said.\n\n\u201cI believe the women who shared their experiences with our investigation team, however legal impediments, including statutes of limitations, preclude criminal prosecution,\u201d Singas said in a statement announcing her decision.\n\nShe said she found no misconduct by attorney general\u2019s office staff.\n\nSchneiderman, 63, said he recognizes that Singas\u2019 decision \u201cdoes not mean I have done nothing wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cI accept full responsibility for my conduct in my relationships with my accusers, and for the impact it had on them,\u201d Schneiderman said through a publicist. \u201cAfter spending time in a rehab facility, I am committed to a lifelong path of recovery and making amends to those I have harmed. I apologize for any and all pain that I have caused, and I apologize to the people of the State of New York for disappointing them after they put their trust in me.\u201d\n\nSchneiderman, a Democrat, announced his resignation in May, hours after The New Yorker published an expose saying that four women had accused him of slapping or choking them.\n\nSome of the women said Schneiderman was a heavy drinker.\n\nSchneiderman at the time didn\u2019t deny the allegations, but implied in an initial statement his conduct was either welcomed or was not as the women described.\n\nMichelle Manning Barish, a Democratic activist and writer, said Schneiderman became controlling and abusive \u2014 slapping her hard across the face and choking her \u2014 soon after they started dating in mid-2013.\n\nManning Barish said Thursday she felt \u201ccompletely vindicated\u201d by Schneiderman\u2019s acknowledgement he had abused women, and said she would work to ensure that legislation outlawing such behavior is passed into law.\n\nTanya Selvaratnam, an author and film producer who dated Schneiderman in 2016 and 2017 and described similar abuse, thanked Singas \u201cfor the care she gave to the investigation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis experience underscores the need for legislation addressing intimate violence so all of those who experience it can come forward knowing they have protection under the law,\u201d Selvaratnam said in a statement.\n\nUnder current New York law, a slap, shove, or kick that doesn\u2019t cause physical injury can be charged as a non-criminal violation, but only if the offender\u2019s intent is to \u201calarm, harass, or annoy\u201d the victim.\n\nCharges can\u2019t be brought if the offender\u2019s intent is sexual arousal or gratification, unless the victim proves the violence caused substantial pain or injuries that go beyond bumps, bruises and cuts.\n\nSingas\u2019 proposal calls for classifying sexually motivated violence as a misdemeanor, which would carry punishment of up to one year in jail, along with a two-year statute of limitations.\n\nManning Barish\u2019s lawyer, Debra Katz, said closing the gap in the law is \u201ccrucial to protect victims of sexual abuse and violence from the deeply emotionally scarring injuries they experience in their intimate relationships.\u201d\n\n\u201cWithout it, abusers can get off scot-free \u2014 even when they later admit to the behavior, as Mr. Schneiderman did today,\u201d Katz said.\n\nIn the meantime, Manning Barish is calling on Schneiderman to donate millions of dollars left in his campaign coffers to women\u2019s shelters and domestic abuse programs in the state, and that she wished him well in his recovery.\n\n\u201cThis is a victory for all women but we need more than words,\u201d she said.\n\nSchneiderman\u2019s campaign fund had about $7.4 million as of July, according to a campaign finance report filed with the state. He had even more money stockpiled, but his campaign refunded about $1 million in donations in the two months after he quit.\n\nSchneiderman\u2019s publicist didn\u2019t immediately respond to a question about his plans for the money.\n\nCuomo appointed Singas as a special prosecutor, bypassing Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. because of a potential conflict of interest. At the time, the attorney general\u2019s office was investigating how Vance\u2019s office had handled a sexual misconduct allegation against movie mogul Harvey Weinstein.\n\nThe allegations tarnished Schneiderman\u2019s reputation as a defender of women at the forefront of the #MeToo movement. Schneiderman launched an investigation last year into movie producer Harvey Weinstein\u2019s studio, and in February filed a lawsuit aimed at securing better compensation for his sexual misconduct accusers.\n\nAfter The New Yorker story was published, Manning Barish wrote on Twitter: \u201cAfter the most difficult month of my life-I spoke up. For my daughter and for all women. I could not remain silent and encourage other women to be brave for me. I could not.\u201d\n\n___\n\nBalsamo reported from Washington.

(Photo by Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP)\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 As an adoring-but-anxious crowd wondered if she\u2019d appear at an all-star concert celebration on her 75th birthday, Joni Mitchell was stuck in traffic.\n\nIt was only fitting for a singer and songwriter whose music helped define the experience of modern Southern California.\n\nGlen Hansard could have been describing the guest of honor when he sang of \u201ca prisoner of the white lines on the freeway\u201d in his rendition of Mitchell\u2019s \u201cCoyote\u201d soon after the show finally began, nearly an hour late.\n\nJames Taylor, Chaka Khan, Kris Kristofferson, Rufus Wainwright and Seal were also among those serenading Mitchell with her own songs Wednesday night at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles.\n\nMitchell didn\u2019t speak or say a word all night, but just showing up was a triumph. For 3 1/2 years, she has been almost completely absent from public life after an aneurysm left her debilitated and unable to speak, and little has been revealed of her condition since.\n\n\u201cYou know, Joni has had a long and arduous recovery from a really major event,\u201d Taylor, one of Mitchell\u2019s oldest friends, told The Associated Press before the show. \u201cBut she\u2019s doing so much better.\u201d\n\nMitchell needed help walking in and getting to her seat in a front corner. The audience greeted her with a standing ovation and spontaneous chorus of \u201cHappy Birthday.\u201d\n\nThe crowd\u2019s love for Mitchell was matched by the artists themselves, especially the women, many of whom said Mitchell was much more than a musical influence.\n\n\u201cI want you to know how many times you have saved my life,\u201d Khan said to Mitchell from the stage before ripping into a sizzling take on Mitchell\u2019s \u201cHelp Me,\u201d with backing from Wainwright and Seal, who like other performers spent much of the night sitting on couches on a stage that looked like a living room.\n\n\u201cJoni Mitchell is an inspiration to every girl who ever picked up a guitar,\u201d Emmylou Harris said after singing Mitchell\u2019s \u201cCold Blue Steel and Sweet Fire.\u201d That inspiration apparently has its limits. Harris didn\u2019t play guitar on the song, saying with a laugh that the \u201cchords are too hard for me.\u201d\n\nThe songs were interspersed with photos of Mitchell and audio clips of her speaking throughout her career, allowing her to serve as the evening\u2019s narrator even as she remained silent.\n\nLater in the evening, film director and Mitchell mega-fan Cameron Crowe presented her with the Music Center\u2019s Excellence in the Performing Arts Award at a dinner gala whose guests included David Geffen, Lily Tomlin, Anjelica Huston and Tom Hanks.\n\nThe concert brought four decades of songs that showed the twisting career path of the onetime Canadian folkie who became the quintessential California singer-songwriter behind albums like \u201cBlue\u201d and \u201cCourt and Spark\u201d and then took her music to places her soft-rock contemporaries would never dare go.\n\nDiana Krall showed the depth of Mitchell\u2019s jazz influence as she sat at the piano and sang \u201cAmelia\u201d from 1976. Kristofferson and Brandi Carlile showed that Mitchell could be a little bit country with their version of 1971\u2032s \u201cA Case of You\u201d and its memorable chorus, \u201cI could drink a case of you darling. Still I\u2019d be on my feet.\u201d\n\nMitchell\u2019s \u201cDreamland\u201d sounded like it was always meant to be a Latin tune when Los Lobos with La Marisoul played it. And James Taylor\u2019s solo acoustic \u201cWoodstock\u201d gave a necessary nod to Mitchell\u2019s simple hippie roots.\n\nThe only song not written by Mitchell was written for her. Graham Nash sang \u201cOur House,\u201d his 1970 song about life with Mitchell when the two were dating in their 20s.\n\nAs the show approached its end, the curtain fell and the crowd chanted for an encore. They went wild when it rose to show Mitchell standing at the front of the stage in a long red coat, black hat and cane.\n\nShe blew out candles on a birthday cake and swayed to the rhythm as all of the night\u2019s musicians combined for 1970\u2032s \u201cBig Yellow Taxi.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey paved paradise, put up a parking lot,\u201d they all sang, in a building that was surrounded on all sides by parking lots.

He ended the day in a tie for 21st.\n\nLi Haotong, who can also win the Race to Dubai at next week\u2019s Tour Championship, carded a 71.\n\nA third player capable of ending the year as Europe\u2019s No. 1, Lucas Bjerregaard, was 3-over.\n\nRace to Dubai leader Francesco Molinari and second-placed Tommy Fleetwood aren\u2019t playing in Sun City.\n\nGarcia\u2019s two Nedbank titles came in 2001 and 2003, and his 64 was his lowest round at the tournament for 17 years. He began with a birdie on Thursday and twice reeled off three in a row.\n\n\u201cI felt great,\u201d he said. \u201cI rolled the ball nicely. I made some good putts here and there. I probably wasn\u2019t swinging unbelievably, but I kept it under control. I kept the ball in play all the time, which is difficult to do here.\u201d\n\nThe 38-year-old Garcia is seeking a second straight victory after winning last month\u2019s Andalucia Valderrama Masters, which his foundation sponsors.\n\nMcIlroy, without a European Tour win this season, needs at least one victory in the next two weeks to have a chance of being crowned Europe\u2019s No. 1 for a fourth time.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "", "", "", "", "MIAMI (5-4) at GREEN BAY (3-4-1)\n\nSunday, 4:25 p.m. ET, CBS\n\nOPENING LINE - Packers by 7\n\nRECORD VS.

It\u2019s also used in about a dozen municipalities around the country.\n\nThe use of the new system, which has some opponents, to determine a congressman has given rise to speculation of a lawsuit, but no one has committed to filing one yet.

Investors have flocked to ETFs because they trade like individual stocks, but offer the diversification benefits of mutual funds \u2014 all at a low cost.\n\nBut not all funds attract investors, and ETFs are dying off at a near-record rate this year. Fund closures can create a costly hassle for investors. Here\u2019s what to do if you face an ETF closure \u2014 and how to avoid one in the future.\n\nWHY ARE ETFS CLOSING?\n\nThe industry\u2019s rapid growth resulted in some funds that proved to be too niche and failed to attract investors. Through September, 132 ETFs have permanently stopped trading this year, only six less than the record of 138 in 2017, according to data from ETF.com. Even so, the number of new funds launched year-to-date, 189, still outpaces closures.\n\nIf you stick with the largest ETFs that track broad market gauges (like the S&P 500) or major asset classes (like bonds), you may never encounter a fund closure. But, if you get more creative when shopping for ETFs , you could get burned.\n\nHOW ETF CLOSURES WORK\n\nIf the company overseeing an ETF in your portfolio decides to close it, you\u2019re a soon-to-be former shareholder. Perhaps the fund is liquidating because it didn\u2019t generate investor interest or attract sufficient assets to cover administrative costs; regardless, the manager no longer sees a viable business case for the ETF.\n\nThe ETF provider generally will announce the fund\u2019s closure by sending notice to shareholders, listing dates when it will stop trading and when its assets will be liquidated.\n\nYou have two options:\n\n\u2014 SELL. Until the ETF stops trading, you can sell shares like normal. The fund will continue to track its underlying index, which helps ensure its price won\u2019t plummet to zero just because of the closure announcement. While you may wish to execute a limit order specifying a minimum selling price, there\u2019s a finite window to execute the trade, so you may not get your desired price.\n\n\u2014 AWAIT LIQUIDATION. You can also simply wait for the fund to be liquidated after its final trading day. The managers will sell all holdings in the fund, settle other obligations and divvy up the balance among remaining shareholders. The price per share from liquidation could differ from the fund\u2019s last trading price, so be aware of this risk.\n\nUNEXPECTED TAXES\n\nThe biggest hassle of an ETF closure is it upends your investment timeline, and there\u2019s nothing you can do about it. You\u2019re forced to sell or take liquidation proceeds, which can create a tax burden or lock in investment losses.\n\nYou may incur a capital gains tax on profits if the ETF\u2019s in a taxable account, that is, a non-retirement account. If you owned the fund less than a year, the profit will be taxed at your normal tax rate. If you owned it for longer than a year, you\u2019ll pay a lower long-term capital gains rate. On the other hand, if you sell for less than you bought, your loss on this investment can offset gains on others. Ask your tax preparer or a financial adviser for advice.\n\nHOW TO AVOID AN ETF CLOSURE\n\nYou have plenty of options for ETFs that have very little risk of closing among the top 100 largest ETFs .\n\nThese funds have a proven track record, encompassing options that track broad market gauges, different geographies, specific industries or even other assets, like bonds. Among them, assets under management range from $259 billion to $7 billion, with average trading volumes ranging from 70 million-plus shares a day to less than 100,000.\n\nLooking at an ETF that\u2019s not on that list of the top ones? Pay attention to:\n\n\u2014 TOTAL ASSETS, the amount of money the ETF has attracted in investment.\n\n\u2014 AVERAGE VOLUME, the average number of shares that trade each day.\n\n\u2014 INCEPTION DATE, the date this ETF began trading.\n\n\u2014 ETF PROVIDER, the company name associated with the fund.\n\nWhile there\u2019s no way to predict which funds will close, when researching an ETF on an online broker, look for red flags, including: ETFs that haven\u2019t attracted much money in assets, have low average trading volume, haven\u2019t gained much traction in the time they\u2019ve been trading or those from providers that don\u2019t oversee many other funds. Compare ETFs that compete with one you\u2019re considering to answer these questions.\n\nThis article was provided to The Associated Press by the personal finance website NerdWallet.

That process is now complete, leading to the artificial mesa being leveled by earthmovers.\n\nOnce that\u2019s done, SpaceX will install a 95,000-gallon liquid oxygen tank and an 80,000-gallon methane tank that the company has taken delivery on in recent months. The tanks, stored for now at the SpaceX control center area a couple of miles west of the launch site, will be used to support propellant-loading operations during space vehicle tests beginning sometime in 2019.\n\nIn February, SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk said tests at Boca Chica would entail \u201cshort hopper flights with the spaceship part of BFR.\u201d\n\nBFR stands for Big Falcon Rocket, a fully reusable, two-stage vehicle consisting of a booster and a spaceship. \u201cHopper flights\u201d refer to SpaceX\u2019s Grasshopper program of low-altitude launch and landing tests of its Falcon 9 rocket at the company\u2019s McGregor test facility.\n\nMusk had been banking on its biggest rocket, the Falcon Heavy, to get humans to Mars, though the focus has shifted to development of the larger, more powerful BFR for Mars flights \u2014 an ambitious goal Musk touched on at the Boca Chica groundbreaking ceremony in September 2014.\n\n\u201cIt could very well be that the first person that departs for another planet could depart from this location,\u201d he said.\n\nOver the last two years SpaceX, based in suburban Los Angeles, has installed two giant ground-station antennas it acquired from Cape Canaveral in Florida and more than 600 kilowatts of solar arrays to power them. The antennas will be used to track manned Crew Dragon missions to and from the International Space Station as well as flights blasting off from Boca Chica.\n\n\u201cThe ongoing construction of our launch pad in South Texas is proceeding well,\u201d said company spokesman Sean Pitt. \u201cSpaceX has now received the final major ground-system tank needed to support initial test flights of the Big Falcon Spaceship.\u201d\n\nMusk estimated initially that the first Boca Chica launch could happen by late 2016. The need for soil surcharging created delays, however, then in September 2016 a Falcon 9 rocket exploded during a fueling test at Cape Canaveral, destroying the launch pad, which SpaceX had to rebuild.\n\nThe company made its first launch from the rebuilt Launch Pad Complex 40 on Dec. 15, 2017, a resupply mission to the ISS using a Falcon 9 rocket and unmanned Dragon capsule. On Feb. 6, SpaceX conducted the maiden launch of the Falcon Heavy rocket from Launch Pad 39a at Cape Canaveral\u2019s Kennedy Space Center.\n\nThat\u2019s the same pad from which Apollo 11 departed for the moon on July 16, 1969, four days before Neil Armstrong became the first human to walk on the lunar surface. Last August, SpaceX affixed a walkway to Launch Pad 39a that NASA astronauts will use to board the Crew Dragon capsule for missions to the ISS.\n\nNASA awarded SpaceX and Boeing contracts in 2014 to ferry its astronauts to and from the space station. Four astronauts have been chosen for SpaceX\u2019s inaugural Crew Dragon mission, tentatively scheduled for April 2019. They will be the first humans sent into space from U.S. soil since the Space Shuttle program was discontinued in 2011.\n\nPropelling the first Crew Dragon mission into space will be the Falcon 9 rocket, 230 feet tall with a payload of 25 tons in Low Earth Orbit. The Falcon Heavy is the same height but much more powerful, with an LEO payload of 70 tons. At a press conference following February\u2019s Falcon Heavy launch, Musk said the mission\u2019s success convinced him of the feasibility of developing the BFR.\n\nThe BFR would stand 387 feet tall, the spaceship portion 180 feet in length, with a payload of more than 110 tons. That\u2019s the rocket SpaceX plans eventually to launch from Boca Chica, where hopper tests of the BFR spaceship are slated to begin next year.\n\nGil Salinas, a member of the governor\u2019s Aerospace and Aviation Advisory Committee and former executive with the Brownsville Economic Development Council who worked closely with SpaceX during negotiations to bring the company here, admitted his initial meeting with Musk in 2011 was mind-blowing \u2014 especially the part about Mars, which Musk says needs to be colonized in order to save humanity.\n\n\u201cWhen he provided us his vision back in 2011 it was just so out there \u2014 where do we begin?\u201d he said.\n\nNow, with SpaceX coming up on 70 launches completed and 35 more planned, every eye in the aerospace sector is on what the company is doing in Cameron County, Salinas said.\n\n\u201cYou can see they are on a path to change the world, and a lot of it is going to be done from here,\u201d Salinas said.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Brownsville Herald, http://www.brownsvilleherald.com", "SYRACUSE, N.Y.

The Rev. Stanley Rother, who was gunned down during the Guatemalan conflict in 1981, was beatified as a martyr in his native Oklahoma last year.\n\nThe Vatican said Thursday that Francis approved a decree recognizing that Miller, from Stevens Point, Wisconsin, died as a martyr on Feb. 13, 1982, in Huehuetenango, Guatemala. The 37-year-old Miller had been working with indigenous youths as a member of the De La Salle Christian Brothers when he was killed by three masked men.\n\nNo one was ever arrested in the slaying. Miller\u2019s fellow brothers reported receiving warnings that Guatemala\u2019s armed forces intelligence unit, the G-2 death squad, was looking for them.\n\nA U.N. truth commission determined that some 245,000 people were killed or disappeared during Guatemala\u2019s 1960-1996 civil war, which pitted right-wing, U.S.-backed governments against leftist guerrillas and indigenous peoples. The vast majority of the killings were attributed to the army or to pro-government paramilitary groups.\n\nBeing declared a martyr exempts Miller from the usual beatification requirement of having a miracle attributed to his intercession confirmed. However, such a miracle would be required for him to be declared a saint.

We didn\u2019t have sufficient elements in hand to fire him three years ago.

(AP Photo/Steven Senne)\n\nNORTHAMPTON, Mass. (AP) \u2014 With its youthful vibe and eclectic mix of culture, a small Massachusetts city seems a logical site for the nation\u2019s first legal recreational marijuana sales east of Colorado.\n\nAn existing medical marijuana dispensary in Northampton \u2014 nestled in Massachusetts\u2019 scenic Pioneer Valley \u2014 plans to open its doors within days to anyone 21 or older looking for products ranging from pre-rolled joints to cannabis-infused edibles, creams, lotions and cooking oils. A second store in the small town of Leicester could also open at or around the same time, while dozens of other retail applicants await final licensing approval from state regulators.\n\nThe initial openings come two full years after Massachusetts residents backed legalization, a vote hailed by a burgeoning cannabis industry eager to expand its geographic base beyond the several western U.S. states where recreational marijuana is sold.\n\nMassachusetts is projected to see sales of at least $1.8 billion and as high as $5 billion annually, industry leaders predict.\n\nBut the road to legal sales has been a long and tedious one. The original target date of Jan. 1, 2018, was almost immediately pushed back six months by the Legislature, Then the July 1 date came, and went and still no stores were cleared to open. Frustration grew among would-be businesses and consumers alike.\n\nOfficials in many communities, including some where a majority of voters had approved legal recreational marijuana, kept pot shops away through moratoriums or zoning restrictions, or by demanding a steep price from cannabis businesses in exchange for signing host community agreements.\n\nNot Northampton, which appeared to roll out the welcome mat. While about 54 percent of all Massachusetts voters supported the 2016 referendum, 73 percent in Northampton gave their blessing, one of the widest margins anywhere in the state.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s already counter-culture. It\u2019s like their customers are already here,\u201d said Steve Morin, a 68-year-old retired delivery truck driver and Air Force veteran who lives in Springfield, Massachusetts. He visits Northampton frequently and described himself as an occasional marijuana user who may shop in the store when it opens.\n\n\u201cIt will be good for tourism,\u201d he added.\n\nThe city\u2019s bustling downtown sports trendy restaurants and coffee shops, bookstores, galleries and a performing arts center. Northampton is home to Smith College, an elite liberal arts school for women and one of several colleges and universities \u2014 including the 30,000-student University of Massachusetts flagship campus \u2014 within a 10-mile radius of the city. Most undergrads, however, aren\u2019t old enough to buy marijuana legally.\n\nNew England Treatment Access, which operates the dispensary, is hoping for the distinction of being the first commercial pot shop to open east of the Mississippi.\n\n\u201cThere exists a marketplace for marijuana right now in Massachusetts and it\u2019s our job as a regulated industry to over time displace the current illegal, untaxed and untested industry with one that is controlled, regulated, taxed and tested,\u201d said Norton Albaraez, the company\u2019s director of government affairs.\n\nAnticipating long lines forming when the store first opens, NETA has worked closely with police and city officials on traffic and parking issues, and retained former Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis \u2014 who became a national figure in the aftermath of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings \u2014 as a security consultant, Albaraez said.\n\nPublic safety isn\u2019t a major concern for Northampton residents like Anthony Bernardo.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in plain view now so I\u2019m happy about that,\u201d said Bernardo, a 36-year-old professional musician, as he pushed his young son in a stroller through a city park. \u201cFor years, I\u2019ve been feeling that marijuana is no more of a danger to society than alcohol.\u201d\n\nMassachusetts hopes to sidestep supply problems and other early pitfalls experienced in legal states, and most recently in Canada, where consumers endured rampant shortages after sales began last month.\n\nCalifornia, which kicked off recreational sales on Jan. 1, remains in a challenging transition period as it attempts to transform what was once a largely vast, illegal market into a multibillion-dollar, regulated economy.\n\nLike Massachusetts, many areas of California have banned commercial pot activity. Initial tax collections have been well below projections and a shaky supply chain has customers looking at barren shelves in some shops.\n\nWashington state launched legal marijuana sales in mid-2014, shortly after Colorado, following a lengthy scramble to license growers, processors and stores, all of whom had to contest a gantlet of regulations ranging from what pesticides they could use to local zoning rules. Only four stores opened on the first day of sales, with customers waiting in long lines to pay exorbitant prices for marijuana also in short supply.\n\nAmong the concerns as recreational sales begin in Massachusetts are those of medical marijuana patients, who fear they\u2019ll be pushed to the back of the line as dispensaries cater to their new and more lucrative customer base.\n\n\u201cOur immediate concern is to have rules in place to make sure patients can access these facilities,\u201d said Michael Latulippe, development director for the Massachusetts Patient Advocacy Alliance who sits on the state\u2019s cannabis advisory board.\n\nA separate area inside the Northampton store will be reserved for customers registered in the state\u2019s medical marijuana program, and they will not be forced to wait in the same lines with recreational customers to enter the building, Albaraez said.\n\nMedical marijuana users are also exempt from paying the combined 20 percent state and local tax on pot.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press reporters Gene Johnson in Seattle and Michael Blood in Los Angeles contributed to this report.", "This undated booking photo provided by the Tarrant County Sheriff's Office shows Clinton Don Simpson.

(Steve Apps/Wisconsin State Journal via AP)\n\nMADISON, Wis. (AP) \u2014 Wisconsin Republican lawmakers on Thursday privately discussed ways they could limit the incoming Democratic governor before he takes office, which the governor-elect described as a \u201cdesperate attempt to cling to power.\u201d\n\nTony Evers, who narrowly defeated Republican Gov. Scott Walker, said GOP legislative leaders should \u201cstop any and all attempts to play politics and weaken the powers of the governor\u2019s office.\u201d Evers said in a statement that making those moves before he takes office Jan. 7 would be a \u201ccomplete violation of the separation of powers in our system.\u201d\n\nSenate Republicans met privately Thursday to discuss ways to reduce Evers\u2019 powers, a day after Assembly Speaker Robin Vos said he, too, would be open to doing that. Republicans have been vague about their specific plans.\n\nWalker hasn\u2019t said whether he would sign any such bills into law. His spokeswoman, Amy Hasenberg, didn\u2019t immediately reply to a message seeking comment. Such a move has precedent: Republicans in North Carolina two years ago limited the number of appointments that the Democratic governor-elect, Roy Cooper, could make once he took office.\n\nGOP Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald downplayed what Republicans were considering, saying they were primarily focused on making sure the rules for how some laws are enforced wouldn\u2019t be changed, including the state\u2019s voter photo ID requirement.\n\nHe said Republicans are also looking at reconstituting boards to make sure they have equal representation, but didn\u2019t specify which ones.\n\nFitzgerald also said Republicans would look to limit the governor\u2019s authority over the process of enacting rules designed to carry out laws the Legislature passes. The Legislature increased Walker\u2019s authority over that process shortly after he took office in 2011. Republicans have been in complete control of the Legislature and governor\u2019s office since that year.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure why there\u2019s all this discussion we\u2019re trying to somehow undermine the new governor,\u201d Fitzgerald told reporters. \u201cThat\u2019s not the case at all. I think there\u2019s some stuff that\u2019s going to be reasonable.\u201d\n\nFormer Democratic Wisconsin Gov. Jim Doyle told The Associated Press on Thursday that he hopes Walker will protect the powers of the office for his successor, Evers.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s some obligation on a governor in that situation to not just be a partisan player anymore and be a protector of the office, and I hope the governor does that,\u201d Doyle said. \u201cI think that\u2019s how many governors would see it. You\u2019re no longer just a party operative, you\u2019re somebody who has to look at the bigger picture.\u201d\n\nThe lame duck session, which legislative leaders called at Walker\u2019s request during the campaign, was supposed to be exclusively about approving a $100 million tax break bill for paper products giant Kimberly-Clark Corp. The incentive package is designed to save a Fox Crossing plant that employs about 500 people. Republicans still don\u2019t have the votes to pass it and its future is uncertain.\n\nWhile that measure is in limbo, Republicans are talking about doing much more, including kneecapping Evers before he takes office. But Fitzgerald said that because of the governor\u2019s substantial veto power, Evers will be able to keep the Legislature \u201cin check.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s equal, balanced government,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll respect Tony Evers like we have any other governor and we\u2019ll work with him.\u201d\n\nRepublicans have an 18-15 majority in the state Senate for the lame duck session, giving them little margin to lose votes. But starting in January, their majority will increase to 19-14.\n\nEvers said in his statement that he wants to work with Republicans and Democrats on issues, including health care, education and infrastructure.\n\nDoyle was in office the last time there was divided government, in 2007 and 2008, when Republicans controlled the Assembly and Democrats had the majority in the Senate. Doyle said he anticipates that Evers will \u201cmake every effort to reach across the aisle\u201d and work with Republicans.\n\n\u201cHe should approach them in good faith with an open hand,\u201d Doyle said.\n\nRepublican Sen. Luther Olsen is chairman of the Senate\u2019s Education Committee and has worked closely over the years with Evers, the state superintendent since 2009. Olsen said he\u2019d be open to scaling back the powers of the governor but acknowledged it would not look good for Republicans to undermine Evers before he takes office.\n\n\u201cThe problem is it just looks like you\u2019re trying to tie the hands of the new governor,\u201d Olsen said. \u201cThe optics problem looks bad.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Scott Bauer on Twitter: https://twitter.com/sbauerAP\n\n___\n\nSign up for \u201cPolitics in Focus,\u201d a weekly newsletter showcasing the AP\u2019s best political reporting from around the country leading up to the midterm elections: https://bit.ly/2ICEr3D", "Real coach Santiago Solari gives instructions from the side line during the Champions League group G soccer match between Real Madrid and Viktoria Plzen at the Doosan arena in Pilsen, Czech Republic, Wednesday, Nov. 7, 2018. (AP Photo/Petr David Josek)\n\nBARCELONA, Spain (AP) \u2014 When Real Madrid visits Celta Vigo on Sunday, interim coach Santiago Solari may have his last chance to convince the club that he should stay on the job.\n\nSolari has steered Madrid to three wins since he was promoted from reserve team last week to replace Julen Lopetegui with the team in slump and coming off a 5-1 rout by Barcelona.\n\nBy indicating Solari was taking over \u201cprovisionally\u201d, Madrid made it clear that it was still searching for a permanent replacement. Media speculation placed Antonio Conte, Roberto Martinez, Mauricio Pochettino, and even former Madrid coach Jose Mourinho on the list of high-profile candidates for the coveted job.\n\nNext week\u2019s international break could offer a new coach a window to adjust to the job. Madrid will have 12 days between matches. It returns with a game at Eibar before it visits Roma in a match that will likely decide who wins their Champions League group.\n\nIf Solari gets a win at Celta, the former Madrid midfielder would present a strong case that the right move is for the club is to do nothing at all.\n\n\u201cThe only thing I can do is focus on our next game and that\u2019s fine with me. I can only see as far as the next link in the chain,\u201d Solari said after Wednesday\u2019s 5-0 win at Viktoria Plzen. \u201cSoccer is all about the here and now and the most important thing is your next game. We\u2019ve come through this one with flying colors and we now have to think about our next match and focus all of our efforts and energy on it.\u201d\n\nSome of Madrid\u2019s most important players have backed him.\n\n\u201cWe are doing well with him, he should stay until the end of the season,\u201d Madrid striker Karim Benzema said. \u201cHe is a great coach. We are playing with more confidence.\u201d\n\nCasemiro added: \u201cPeople can talk about what he is, if someone else is coming, but we are treating him with a lot of respect, like the coach of Madrid. If things go well, why not give him the chance?\u201d\n\nAt a glance, it seems Solari has completely turned around a team that when he inherited it had won only one of its previous seven matches. With the Argentine directing the team, Madrid has outscored its three adversaries 11-0.\n\nBut a closer look shows that Solari may still have work to do to win the trust of club president Florentino Perez.\n\nA 4-0 win at third-division club Melilla is nothing to brag about considering the abyss separating the clubs in terms of talent.\n\nThe final score of a 2-0 home victory over Valladolid is deceptive since Valladolid twice hit the crossbar with the score 0-0 before Madrid finally broke through with less than 10 minutes to play.\n\nAnd the rout of Czech side Viktoria Plzen comes against the only team Madrid was able to beat in its final agonizing weeks under Lopetegui.\n\nSo on Sunday, Solari needs his team to avoid a repeat of its shaky performance against Valladolid and get a convincing win against a quality opponent. If not, the progress the team has made under him will be seriously questioned and the pressure will again be on the club to bring in an experienced coach.\n\nMadrid heads to northwestern Spain to face Celta in sixth place in the Spanish league standings, seven points behind leader Barcelona.\n\nCelta has had an irregular campaign and sits in 11th place, three points behind Madrid.\n\nHowever, Celta has only lost three times in 11 matches and is led by Iago Aspas. The Spain striker has scored eight goals this season, second only to Barcelona forward Luis Suarez with nine.\n\nCelta also recovered striker Maxi Gomez from injury in time for him to score twice in a 3-3 draw with Real Betis last week.\n\nLast year, Celta held Madrid to a 2-2 draw at Balaidos Stadium.\n\n\u201cIt will be a difficult match,\u201d Aspas said. \u201cThey have gone through several changes ... but they are still Real Madrid and have the best players in the world.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "Danish national Britta Nielsen appears in the Randburg Magistrates Court in Johannesburg, Thursday, Nov. 8 2018.

The court won\u2019t hear arguments again until Nov. 26.\n\nRib fractures are common among older adults, particularly after falls.

Broken ribs typically heal on their own in six weeks to a month, and patients are advised to limit strenuous activity. But they can be very painful and controlling pain is key. A chief complication is pneumonia, when patients don\u2019t breathe deeply enough or cough enough because of the rib pain.\n\nAppointed by President Bill Clinton in 1993, Ginsburg rebuffed suggestions from some liberals that she should step down in the first two years of President Barack Obama\u2019s second term, when Democrats also controlled the Senate and would have been likely to confirm her successor.\n\nShe already has hired clerks for the term that extends into 2020, indicating she has no plans to retire.\n\nGinsburg leads the court\u2019s liberal wing.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Lauran Neergaard contributed to this report.", "RUSSELLVILLE, Ala.

(SANA via AP)\n\nDAMASCUS, Syria (AP) \u2014 Syrian troops have liberated 19 women and children hostages held by the Islamic State group since July in a military operation in the country\u2019s center, ending a months-long crisis that has stunned Syria\u2019s Druze religious minority, state media reported Thursday. An opposition war monitor said the release was part of an exchange.\n\nSANA news agency said in its report that the operation occurred in the Hamima area east of the historic town of Palmyra. It said all IS fighters in the area where the hostages were held have been killed.\n\nThe Suwayda 24 activist collective quoted local officials as saying the women and children held by IS have all been freed.\n\n\u201cMy happiness is huge,\u201d Nashaat Abu Ammar, whose wife, two sons and daughter are among those freed, told The Associated Press by telephone.\n\nThe 19 women and children were among 30 people kidnapped by IS in the southern province of Sweida on July 25 when militants of the extremist group ambushed residents and went on a killing spree that left at least 216 people dead.\n\nThe rare attacks in Sweida province, populated mainly by Syria\u2019s minority Druze, came amid a government offensive elsewhere in the country\u2019s south. The coordinated attacks across the province, which included several suicide bombings, shattered the calm of a region that had been largely spared from the worst of the violence of Syria\u2019s seven-year long civil war.\n\nA Syrian opposition war monitor contradicted the reports on state media, saying IS set free the hostages in return for the government\u2019s release of women related to IS fighters and commanders who were held by Syrian authorities as well as a monetary payment.\n\nThe Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said it was not immediately clear how much money the government paid for the release of the hostages.\n\nState TV aired footage of the women, children and teenagers in a desert area standing with soldiers who gave them bread and water.

Negotiations were expected to free the remaining hostages but after the talks failed, Syrian troops launched a broad offensive against IS in southern Syria.\n\nThe July 25 attack on the southern city of Sweida and nearby villages was one of the deadliest by the extremists since they lost most of the land they once held in Syria and Iraq.\n\n\u201cI am so happy they have been freed and I thank the Syrian army for that,\u201d Abu Ammar said.

But late Thursday a police union announced it was ending the protest after agreeing upon a deal with the Interior Ministry.\n\nThe Warsaw court ruling follows a similar ruling in Wroclaw on a city ban on a nationalist march there for Sunday.\n\nCity authorities still have the right to appeal the rulings.\n\nWarsaw city spokesman Bartosz Milczarczyk said \u201cwe respect the court\u2019s verdict.\u201d He said town hall officials were studying it before deciding whether to appeal.\n\nEarlier in the day, before the ruling, Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said authorities would do everything in their power to crack down on any expressions of extremism at the march.\n\n\u201cWe want the march to be peaceful and not provoke tensions,\u201d Morawiecki told reporters.\n\nHis comments come amid other signs that Poland\u2019s conservative ruling Law and Justice party is now seeking to take a firmer stance against ultra-nationalists after a period in which they seemed to be trying to appease them.\n\nExtremists from Hungary and elsewhere have in past years joined Poland\u2019s Nov. 11 march, which is meant to mark Poland\u2019s regaining of its independence at the end of World War I.\n\nSaying he expected up to 200,000 participants Sunday at the inclusive Warsaw march, Morawiecki acknowledged it could be hard to control them all, but said \u201cwe will try to eliminate all banners which are extremist.\u201d\n\nHe also said there will be no tolerance for foreign neo-fascists or other agitators.\n\nMany other World War I centennial events are expected across the country on Sunday, with the most emotional expected to be the public singing of the national hymn at noon in hundreds of places.", "Wife says she, not her son, fatally shot Missouri KKK leader\n\nThis photo provided by the St. Francois County Sheriff's Department in Farmington, Mo., shows Malissa Ancona, who faces first-degree murder charges in the February 2017 death of Frank Ancona, who called himself an \"imperial wizard\" of the Ku Klux Klan.

Multiple people were shot and killed late Wednesday by a gunman who opened fire at the Borderline Bar & Grill, which was holding a weekly country music dance night for college students. (AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez)\n\nTHOUSAND OAKS, Calif. (AP) \u2014 Terrified patrons hurled barstools through windows to escape or threw their bodies protectively on top of friends as a Marine combat veteran killed 12 people at a country music bar in an attack that added Thousand Oaks to the tragic roster of American cities traumatized by mass shootings.\n\nDressed all in black with his hood pulled up, the gunman apparently took his own life as scores of police converged on the Borderline Bar and Grill in Southern California.\n\nThe motive for the rampage late Wednesday night was under investigation.\n\nThe killer , Ian David Long, 28, was a former machine gunner and Afghanistan war veteran who was interviewed by police at his home last spring after an episode of agitated behavior that authorities were told might be post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nOpening fire with a handgun with an illegal, extra-capacity magazine, Long shot a security guard outside the bar and then went in and took aim at employees and customers, authorities said. He also used a smoke bomb, according to a law enforcement official who was not authorized to discuss the investigation publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe dead included a man who had survived last year\u2019s massacre in Las Vegas, a veteran sheriff\u2019s deputy who rushed in to confront the gunman, a 22-year-old man who planned to join the Army, a freshman at nearby Pepperdine University and a recent Cal Lutheran graduate.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a horrific scene in there,\u201d Ventura County Sheriff Geoff Dean said in the parking lot. \u201cThere\u2019s blood everywhere.\u201d\n\nSurvivors of the rampage \u2014 mostly young people who had gone out for college night at the Borderline, a hangout popular with students from nearby California Lutheran University and other schools \u2014 seemed to know what to do, having come of age in an era of active-shooter drills and deadly rampages happening with terrifying frequency.\n\nFor some it was not a new experience. Survivors and their relatives said several people who were at the bar Thursday had been at the outdoor country music festival in Las Vegas last year where a gunman in a high-rise hotel killed 58 people.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want prayers. I don\u2019t want thoughts,\u201d said Susan Schmidt-Orfanos, whose son Telemachus Orfanos survived the Vegas shooting only to die less than 10 minutes from his home. \u201cI want those bastards in Congress \u2014 they need to pass gun control so no one else has a child that doesn\u2019t come home.\u201d\n\nMany of the estimated 150 patrons at the Borderline dived under tables, ran for exits, broke through windows or hid in the attic and bathrooms, authorities and witnesses said.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately our young people, people at nightclubs, have learned that this may happen, and they think about that,\u201d the sheriff said. \u201cFortunately it helped save a lot of lives that they fled the scene so rapidly.\u201d\n\nMatt Wennerstrom said he instinctively pulled people behind a pool table, and he and friends shielded women with their bodies after hearing the shots. When the gunman paused to reload, Wennerstrom said, he and others shattered windows with barstools and helped about 30 people escape. He heard another volley of shots once he was safely outside.\n\n\u201cAll I wanted to do was get as many people out of there as possible,\u201d he told KABC-TV. \u201cI know where I\u2019m going if I die, so I was not worried.\u201d\n\nA video posted on Instagram after the shooting by one of the patrons shows an empty dance floor with the sound of windows shattering in the background. As a silhouetted figure comes through a doorway, the camera turns erratically and 10 gunshots ring out.\n\n\u201cI looked him in his eyes while he killed my friends,\u201d Dallas Knapp wrote on his post. \u201cI hope he rots in hell for eternity.\u201d\n\nThe tragedy left a community that is annually listed as one of the safest cities in America reeling. Shootings of any kind are extremely rare in Thousand Oaks, a city of about 130,000 people about 40 miles (64 kilometers) from Los Angeles, just across the county line.\n\nMourners gathered for a vigil on Wednesday evening as smoke from a fast-moving, nearby wildfire billowed over them.\n\nEarlier, people stood in line for hours to give blood. All morning, people looking for missing friends and relatives arrived at a community center where authorities and counselors were informing the next-of-kin of those who died. Many people walked past TV cameras with blank stares or tears in their eyes. In the parking lot, some comforted each other with hugs or a pat on the back.\n\nJason Coffman received the news that his son Cody, 22, who was about to join the Army, was dead. Coffman broke down as he told reporters how his last words to his son as he went out that night were not to drink and drive and that he loved him.\n\n\u201cOh, Cody, I love you, son,\u201d Coffman sobbed.\n\nIt was the nation\u2019s deadliest such attack since 17 students and teachers were killed at a Parkland, Florida, high school nine months ago. It also came less than two weeks after a gunman massacred 11 people at a synagogue in Pittsburgh.\n\nDemocratic Gov.-elect Gavin Newsom, in his first public appearance since winning office on Tuesday, lamented the violence that has returned to California.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a gun culture,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t go to a bar or nightclub? You can\u2019t go to church or synagogue? It\u2019s insane is the only way to describe it. The normalization, that\u2019s the only way I can describe it. It\u2019s become normalized.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump praised police for their \u201cgreat bravery\u201d in the attack and ordered flags flown at half-staff in honor of the victims.\n\nAuthorities searched Long\u2019s home in Newbury Park, about 5 miles from the Borderline bar, for clues to what set him off.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no indication that he targeted the employees. We haven\u2019t found any correlation,\u201d the sheriff said. \u201cMaybe there was a motive for this particular night, but we have no information leading to that at all.\u201d\n\nLong was in the Marines from 2008 to 2013, rose to the rank of corporal and served in Afghanistan in 2010-11 before he was honorably discharged, the military said. Court records show he married in 2009 and was divorced in 2013.\n\nAuthorities said he had no criminal record, but in April officers were called to his home, where deputies found him angry and acting irrationally. The sheriff said officers were told he might have PTSD because of his military service. A mental health specialist met with him and didn\u2019t feel he needed to be hospitalized.\n\nTom Hanson, 70, who lives next door to Long and his mother, said he called the police about six months ago when he heard \u201cheavy-duty banging\u201d and shouting coming from the Longs\u2019 home.\n\n\u201cSomebody has missed something here,\u201d his wife, Julie Hanson, said. \u201cThis woman has to know that this child needed help.\u201d\n\nLong was armed with a Glock 21, a .45-caliber pistol designed to hold 10 rounds plus one in the chamber, according to the sheriff. But it had an extended magazine \u2014 one capable of holding more ammunition \u2014 that is illegal in California, Dean said.\n\nSheriff\u2019s Sgt. Ron Helus and a passing highway patrolman arrived at the club around 11:20 p.m. in response to several 911 calls, heard gunfire and went inside, the sheriff said. Helus was shot immediately, Dean said.\n\nThe highway patrolman pulled Helus out, then waited as a SWAT team and other officers arrived. Helus died at a hospital.\n\nBy the time officers entered the bar again \u2014 about 15 to 20 minutes later, according to the sheriff\u2019s office \u2014 the gunfire had stopped. They found 12 people dead inside, including the gunman, who was discovered in an office, the sheriff said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that they saved lives by going in there and engaging with the suspect,\u201d said Dean, who was set to retire Friday. He praised the slain officer \u2014 a close friend \u2014 as a hero: \u201cHe went in there to save people and paid the ultimate price.\u201d\n\nOne other person was wounded by gunfire, and as many as 15 others suffered minor injuries from jumping out windows or diving under tables, authorities said.\n\nFive off-duty police officers who were at the bar also helped people escape, authorities said.\n\nFor several hours after the violence, survivors gathered in the dark, some sobbing and hugging as they awaited word on the fate of friends as ambulances idled nearby. Several men were bare-chested after using their shirts to plug wounds and tie tourniquets.\n\nAround midday, the body of the slain sheriff\u2019s officer was taken by motorcade from the hospital to the coroner\u2019s office. Thousands of people stood along the route or pulled over in their vehicles to watch the hearse pass.\n\nHelus was a 29-year veteran of the force with a wife and son and planned to retire in the coming year, said the sheriff, choking back tears.\n\n___\n\nAP journalists Andrew Dalton, Amanda Lee Myers, John Antczak and Brian Melley in Los Angeles, Michelle A.

Tesla has announced that Robyn Denholm of Australia's Telstra will become its new board chair. Musk agreed to vacate his post as board chairman as part of a settlement with U.S. regulators of a lawsuit alleging he duped investors with misleading statements about a proposed buyout of the company. (AP Photo/Kiichiro Sato, File)\n\nDETROIT (AP) \u2014 Australian telecommunications executive Robyn Denholm brings much-needed financial and auto industry expertise to her new role as Tesla\u2019s board chairwoman, but her biggest challenge is whether she can rein in a CEO with a proclivity for misbehavior.\n\nDenholm, who has been a Tesla board member for nearly five years, was named to the post late Wednesday, replacing Elon Musk as part of a securities fraud settlement with U.S. government regulators.\n\nCorporate governance experts say they would have preferred an outsider with manufacturing expertise be appointed to lead the board, now dominated by people with personal and financial ties to Musk, including his brother.\n\nThey aren\u2019t sure if Denholm was hired just to placate the Securities and Exchange Commission to comply with the settlement or whether she\u2019ll actually be able to corral the visionary but erratic Musk, who remains CEO.\n\n\u201cWith all the crazy stuff going on, she was there,\u201d said Rohan Williamson, a finance professor who studies corporate governance at Georgetown University\u2019s McDonough School of Business. \u201cShe couldn\u2019t control him before. Is anything going to change?\u201d\n\nDenholm, 55, is chief financial officer and strategy head at Telstra Corp. Ltd., Australia\u2019s largest telecommunications company. Her new role at Tesla came largely because of the board\u2019s failure to control Musk, especially when he made a surprise announcement over Twitter in August that funding was secured to take Tesla private at $420 per share.\n\nThat drove up Tesla\u2019s stock price and hurt short-sellers, investors who bet against the company\u2019s success. Eventually it drew a lawsuit from the SEC alleging that Musk misled investors.\n\nDenholm will step down from Telstra after a six-month notice period. Then she\u2019ll work full-time at Tesla, where she has served on the board since 2014. Under the SEC settlement, Musk can\u2019t return as chairman for three years, and only with a shareholder vote.\n\nThe move vaults Denholm from relative obscurity into a high-profile position of trying to muzzle Musk and manage a company that is struggling to produce vehicles and make money.\n\nCharles Elson, director of the corporate governance center at the University of Delaware, said Tesla should have brought in someone from outside. No matter how talented Denholm may be, and even though she appears to have fewer ties to Musk than other directors, she has a shadow over her of being on the board that did little as Musk misbehaved. \u201cYou really have got to wonder,\u201d he said. \u201cNo other CEO of any other public company would have survived this.\u201d\n\nMaking Denholm a full-time chair also creates governance problems because she could become a Tesla executive, blurring her role as an independent check on management, Elson said.\n\nEmail messages sent to Denholm Thursday were not immediately returned and Tesla declined comment beyond its statement announcing Denholm as chair.\n\nDenholm brings financial experience and other positives to the table for Tesla, said Michael Cusumano, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s Sloan School of Management.\n\nBefore Telstra, she worked in Silicon Valley as chief financial officer at Juniper Networks and head of corporate strategic planning at Sun Microsystems. She also was national finance manager at Toyota Motor Corp.\u2019s operations in Australia, and she\u2019s a member of the board at Swiss robotics and industrial machinery maker ABB.\n\n\u201cShe could bring some more financial discipline to Tesla,\u201d which has $10 billion in debt and must keep manufacturing a large number of lower-priced Model 3 sedans to service its large debt and pay the bills, Cusumano said. Tesla cars also are having reliability problems, he said.\n\nCusumano further notes that Denholm\u2019s track record as a Tesla board member is not necessarily an indication of how she\u2019ll be as a chairwoman.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s had a ringside seat to the chaos and she didn\u2019t or was not in a position to change anything,\u201d said Cusumano, who has served on corporate boards. \u201cAll the information you are given comes from the CEO, COO, CFO,\u201d he said. \u201cIt really is a restricted position. So I don\u2019t think we can say that, well, she was ineffective as a director, the whole board was ineffective, so she\u2019s likely to be ineffective as chairwoman.\u201d\n\nOn Twitter Thursday morning, Musk wrote that he has great respect for Denholm. \u201cVery much look forward to working together,\u201d he wrote.\n\nIn a statement, Denholm said she believes in Tesla and looks forward to helping Musk and the company \u201cachieve sustainable profitability and drive long-term shareholder value.\u201d\n\nTesla earned a $311.5 million net profit during the third-quarter. It was only the third time that Tesla has posted a quarterly profit in its eight-year history as a public company and the first time in two years. Telsa has never reported an annual profit.\n\nUnder the settlement with the SEC, Tesla also is required to appoint two new independent directors, and it must review Musk\u2019s posts about the company on Twitter. Musk and Tesla each had to pay a $20 million penalty under the September deal with the SEC, and he cannot return as chairman for three years.\n\nBut controlling Musk will be a big job for Denholm. Even after the settlement was announced, Musk taunted the SEC, calling it the \u201cShortseller Enrichment Commission\u201d before snidely praising it for \u201cdoing incredible work.\u201d", "EUGENE, Ore.

But the victories, coupled with the pickup of a congressional seat held by Republicans for decades, are being characterized by Democrats as signs that they could be chipping away at the GOP\u2019s longtime hold on state government.\n\nThe pickups in South Carolina\u2019s House and Senate chambers came on a night when Democrats regained control of the U.S. House from Republicans and even picked up one U.S. House seat in South Carolina that hadn\u2019t been held by a Democrat since 1980.

But Loveday said the victories can help build momentum over the next two years, when all House and Senate seats will be up for election.\n\n\u201cPotential candidates for 2020 and even further looked at Tuesday night and thought, \u2018It is possible. I could beat an incumbent,\u2019 or, \u2018I could beat a Republican in a red district,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nDemocrats also marked a win in the sole state Senate seat up for grabs this year, with Columbia attorney Dick Harpootlian, a former chairman of the state Democratic Party, winning a seat Republicans had held for more than 30 years. The special election victory puts Harpootlian, 69, in office for the final two years of the term of John Courson, who resigned during a probe into corruption at the Statehouse, pleading guilty to converting his campaign money to personal use.\n\nThat win, state Democrats\u2019 first flip in the chamber since 2000, brings their Senate numbers to 19 \u2014 still far from the majority Republicans\u2019 27 seats. Until Harpootlian\u2019s victory over Benjamin Dunn, a 48-year-old attorney and war veteran who served in Afghanistan, no Democrat has held this seat in more than three decades.\n\nIn addition to both of South Carolina\u2019s legislative chambers, Republicans also control South Carolina\u2019s governorship and all statewide-elected offices.

(AP Photo/Olivier Matthys)\n\nMILAN (AP) \u2014 The Italian government insisted Thursday it is sticking with its plan to rapidly increase public spending as a dispute with the European Union over the budget intensified following a gloomy set of forecasts.\n\nIn response to the EU\u2019s executive Commission\u2019s prediction that Italy will be the slowest-growing economy in the 19-country eurozone through 2020, Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte said his government had no intention of revising its plans by next week, as Brussels had requested.\n\n\u201cThe Commission growth forecast for next year underestimates the positive impact of our economic maneuver and our structural reforms,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are going ahead with our estimates on the public finances, with growth that will increase and debt and deficit that will decrease.\u201d\n\nThe worry in Brussels and in financial markets, where interest rates on Italian bonds have spiked sharply, is that the budget plans would prevent the country\u2019s huge debt burden from falling, as promised.\n\nAnd that could raise renewed questions about the future of the euro. Italy\u2019s public debt burden stands at around 130 percent of the annual GDP, second in the eurozone behind Greece, which only emerged from its eight-year bailout era in the summer.\n\nThe Commission said it expects the Italian economy, the eurozone\u2019s third-largest, to grow by only 1.2 percent in 2019, below the 1.5 percent projected by the government. And in 2020, the Commission forecasts Italian growth of only 1.3 percent, again 0.3 percentage point-lower than the projection from Rome.\n\nAs a result, the Commission expects higher budget deficits for Italy, notably for next year. Rather than the 2.4 percent of GDP predicted by Italy, the Commission expects 2.9 percent, a level that would not bring down Italy\u2019s overall debt stock.\n\n\u201cThere are no grounds for questioning the foundation and sustainability of our forecasts,\u201d said Conte, adding that Italy expects the debt load to decrease to 126.7 percent of GDP by 2021.\n\nThe Commission doesn\u2019t appear to be in a mood to haggle.\n\n\u201cThere cannot be a sort of negotiation on this,\u201d said Pierre Moscovici, the commissioner responsible for economic matters.\n\nCountries that use the euro have to seek approval from the Commission for their budgets as part of a coordination exercise designed to prevent a repeat of the debt crisis that afflicted the region over the past decade. The Commission could sanctions Italy if it does not revise its plans by Tuesday.\n\nThe Italian government argues that the economy needs a stimulus so it can turn around after stagnating for years. Boosting growth, it argues, will help control debt levels and eventually solidify the country\u2019s place within the single currency bloc.\n\nAs part of those ambitions, the Italian government is raising spending to fund, among other things, a minimum income scheme for jobseekers and restore early retirement for eligible workers, doing away with an unpopular reform.\n\nLorenzo Codogno, a former Italian Treasury official who runs LC Macro Advisors, said the Commission\u2019s deficit forecasts were perhaps a bit \u201cpessimistic\u201d given the likely delays in the implementation of policy measures.\n\nThe Commission, he added, looked like it was setting the stage to sanction Italy and that any \u201cpossible tweaks the government may be considering to introduce by the Nov. 13 deadline will do little to narrow this huge gap.\u201d\n\nBond market investors are already fretting, having marked up interest rates on Italian debt significantly over the past few months.\n\nItaly\u2019s economy comes amid a broader slowdown in the eurozone as a whole, which the Commission expects to slow amid global uncertainties, trade tensions, and higher oil prices.\n\nOverall eurozone growth is forecast to moderate to 2.1 percent this year from a decade-high rate of 2.4 percent in 2017. It expects a further easing to 1.9 percent in 2019 and 1.7 percent in 2020.\n\nAnd Brexit could yet hurt growth even further, especially if Britain crashes out of the EU in March with no deal on future relations. Uncertainty over Brexit is the main reason why the Commission expects Britain to match Italy\u2019s paltry growth of 1.2 percent next and to remain at that level in 2020.\n\n___\n\nPylas reported from London.", "DAKAR, Senegal (AP) \u2014 International rights groups are urging Mauritania to release anti-slavery activists, as the United States has announced it will end trade benefits to the West African country over the continuation of slavery.\n\nAmnesty International and 32 other human rights organizations on Thursday called for the release of 35-year-old blogger Mohamed Cheikh Ould Mkhaitir, who remains in custody in an undisclosed location, with limited access to his family and no access to his lawyers.\n\nMkhaitir was initially arrested in January 2014 after he published a blog that spoke of slavery and discrimination, including against the blacksmith caste, which he belongs to, according to Amnesty International. He was convicted of apostasy and sentenced to death in December 2014. An appeals court later reduced his punishment to two years imprisonment, which he has served. However, he has not yet been released.\n\nMore than 150 cases of arbitrary arrests of human rights defenders have been recorded by Amnesty International since 2014. Amnesty called on Mauritania\u2019s financial and technical partners to apply more pressure to end slavery in the country.\n\nEarly this year, The African Union ruled the West African nation has not enforced its own anti-slavery laws after it passed out a lenient sentence to slave owners.\n\nThe U.S. in its statement this month said Mauritania is not making sufficient progress toward combating forced labor, including slavery. As a result, it said it will end Mauritania\u2019s trade benefits under the African Growth and Opportunity Act, which permits some duty-free trade.\n\n\u201cForced or compulsory labor practices like hereditary slavery have no place in the 21st century,\u201d said Deputy U.S. Trade Representative C.J. Mahoney. \u201cThis action underscores this administration\u2019s commitment to ending modern slavery and enforcing labor provisions in our trade laws and trade agreements. We hope Mauritania will work with us to eradicate forced labor and hereditary slavery so that its AGOA eligibility may be restored in the future.\u201d\n\nMauritania was the last country to abolish slavery in 1981, though the practice remains. The 2018 Global Slavery Index indicates that 90,000 people still live as slaves in Mauritania.\n\nThe Mauritanian government, however, denies that slavery is widespread in the country.\n\n\u201cMauritania has made great efforts to eradicate the aftermath of slavery and has achieved undoubtedly significant results in this regard,\u201d the government said in a statement.\n\nIt said the U.S. decision is motivated by misinformation, and that the government hopes that the Trump administration will reconsider its decision.\n\nU.S. imports from Mauritania of fish, fertilizers and mineral fuels were more than $61 million in 2017.\n\nFrancois Patuel, West Africa researcher for Amnesty International, said that while the group cannot take a position on sanctions, \u201cwe encourage Mauritania\u2019s financial and technical partners to continue to raise the issues of the persistence of slavery, discrimination and reprisals against human rights defenders during political dialogues.\u201d\n\nHe called on technical and financial partners to call on Mauritania to bring suspected slave owners to justice and \u201cto create a safe and supportive environment for activists.\u201d\n\n\u201cMauritania gets a lot of support because it is considered a key ally on the war on terror, both by the U.S. government and European governments,\u201d said Patuel. \u201cWe\u2019ve been telling them to make sure this isn\u2019t used as a carte blanche for authorities to do what they want without repercussions.\u201d\n\nHe said dialogue and pressure are needed to eradicate slavery. Patuel also warned: \u201cTo be coherent, the U.S. should stop deporting individuals to Mauritania where they would face discrimination and arrests.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP reporter Ahmed Mohamed in Nouakchott, Mauritania contributed to this report."]
