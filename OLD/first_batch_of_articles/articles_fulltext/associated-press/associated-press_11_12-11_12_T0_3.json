But he made his decision and I want to apologize again.\u201d\n\nHiguain was excited to prove Juventus wrong when it arranged his departure in the offseason to make room for Cristiano Ronaldo, and his mental state had even been questioned by coach Gennaro Gattuso in the buildup to the match.\n\n\u201cWhen you play against a team where you used to play, the emotions are different, but I take responsibility and it won\u2019t happen again,\u201d said Higuain, reiterating that it had not been his decision to leave Juventus. \u201cI am a very emotional person and player, and sometimes it\u2019s difficult to control my feelings. Sometimes I should react less, but that\u2019s how I am.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m aware that we (players) are also an example to children, and my reaction wasn\u2019t the right one. But we\u2019re not robots.\u201d\n\nHiguain had just one shot on target and was clearly growing frustrated even before being shown what he thought was a harsh yellow card by the referee.\n\nThe Argentina forward was in tears after then being shown a red card and had to be led away by teammates as well as by Juventus players \u2014 including Ronaldo, who scored Juve\u2019s second goal.\n\nHiguain apologized to the referee after the match and was also defended by Juventus players, who said they hoped he wouldn\u2019t face a lengthy ban.\n\n\u201cI told Higuain not to go over the top, so as not to risk further punishment,\u201d Ronaldo said. \u201cHe was nervous, he was losing.

But people familiar with the talks said this week that Long Island City and Crystal City have emerged as front runners for the \u201cHQ2\u201d project and its total of 50,000 jobs.\n\nA look at two communities said to be at the top of Amazon\u2019s list.\n\nLONG ISLAND CITY\n\nIt\u2019s already the fastest-developing neighborhood in the nation\u2019s most populous city, and Amazon could pump up the volume in this buzzy part of Queens.\n\nIf chosen, the neighborhood stands to burnish New York City\u2019s reputation as a tech capital. Landing Amazon would also cement Long Island City\u2019s transformation from a faded manufacturing zone to a vibrant, of-the-moment enclave of waterfront skyscrapers, modernized warehouses and artsy-tech ambience across the East River from midtown Manhattan.\n\n\u201cI joke that we\u2019re experiencing explosive growth 30 years in the making,\u201d says Elizabeth Lusskin, president of the Long Island City Partnership, a neighborhood development group.\n\nBut Long Island City also has been straining to handle its growth.\n\nDays before the potential Amazon news emerged, the city announced a $180 million plan to address Long Island City\u2019s packed schools, street design and a sewage system that groans in heavy rain. But those projects will just catch up with current needs, says area City Councilman Jimmy van Bramer.\n\n\u201cI know that there are a lot of people cheerleading for this, but HQ2 has to work for Queens and the people of Queens. It can\u2019t just be good for Amazon,\u201d says van Bramer, a Democrat.\n\nOnce a bustling factory and freight-moving area, Long Island City saw many of its plants and warehouses closed as manufacturing shriveled in New York City.\n\nThe neighborhood\u2019s rebirth began in the 1980s, when officials broached redeveloping a swath of the waterfront, while artists were drawn by warehouse spaces, affordable rents and a building that is now the MoMA PS1 museum. Silvercup Studios \u2014 where such TV shows as \u201cSex and the City,\u201d \u203330 Rock\u201d and \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d have been filmed \u2014 opened in 1983.\n\nLong Island City gained a new commercial stature, and the start of a high-rise skyline, when the banking giant now called Citi opened an office tower there in 1989. But the area\u2019s growth lately has been driven by residential building.\n\nSome 9,150 new apartments and homes have been built since 2010, more than in any other New York City neighborhood, according to the city Planning Department . Thousands more units are in the works.\n\nNew York has striven for nearly a decade to position itself as a tech hotspot.\n\nVenture capitalists poured $5.8 billion into New York-area startups last quarter, more than any other region except the San Francisco area, according to the consulting and accounting firm PwC . Established tech giants, including Google and Facebook, have been expanding their New York footprints.\n\nStill, landing HQ2 would represent \u201cincredible validation of just how far New York has come,\u201d says Jonathan Bowles, executive director of the Center for an Urban Future think tank.\n\nWaiting for a subway, Long Island City community board chairwoman Denise Keehan-Smith could envision Amazon benefiting the neighborhood.\n\n\u201cBut I think we have to be careful about it,\u201d she said.\n\nCRYSTAL CITY\n\nIf any place in America can absorb 25,000 Amazon jobs without disruption, it may well be Crystal City, Virginia, where nearly that many jobs have vanished over the last 15 years.\n\nThe neighborhood in Arlington County is bounded by the Potomac River and the nation\u2019s capital on one side, by the Pentagon on another and Reagan National Airport on a third.\n\nDespite its prime location and abundant transportation options, the neighborhood has been hit by a massive outflow of jobs. The Patent and Trademark Office began moving more than 7,000 jobs out of Crystal City in 2003. In 2005, the Defense Department announced plans to move roughly 17,000 jobs elsewhere as part of a base realignment.\n\nArlington County has worked hard to bring in new employers, and had some success. The Public Broadcasting Service moved its headquarters to Crystal City in 2006.\n\nStill, large swaths of the neighborhood remain vacant. Among other challenges, the area has fought to overcome a reputation for outdated architecture.\n\nCrystal City is populated by \u201970s and \u201980s-era office buildings. The buildings are connected by a network of tunnels populated with food-court style dining options, hair salons and newsstands. The tunnels leave the ground-level outdoor streetscape sometimes looking empty.\n\nBrookings Institution urban planner Jenny Schuetz suggested the buildings may require an upgrade, or even replacement. But she noted that while people often associate tech companies with converted lofts or state-of-the art workspaces, many big Silicon Valley tech companies actually work out of \u201980s-era office buildings.\n\nFor all the talk about antiquated architecture, people who\u2019ve actually worked in Crystal City appreciate its convenience and its worker-friendly features, including the tunnels.\n\n\u201cI loved it here,\u201d said Christine Gentry of Greenbelt, Maryland, as she ate breakfast in a largely empty food court. She works for the Patent and Trademark Office and preferred the days when her office was in Crystal City.\n\n\u201cEverything is accessible here,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen it was raining or snowing or sleeting, I never had to go out.\u201d\n\nPerhaps no place better illustrates the vibe of Crystal City than the region\u2019s only revolving restaurant, the Skydome atop the Doubletree Crystal City.

A wave of digital pocket money apps that come with prepaid cards are new tools for financial education as money increasingly goes digital, in a shift that\u2019s raising uncertainty about how cashless transactions affect youngsters\u2019 view of money. (AP Photo/Kelvin Chan)\n\nLONDON (AP) \u2014 For kids growing up in today\u2019s cashless society, the piggy bank is going virtual.\n\nFather of two Roland Hall turned to a British startup\u2019s digital pocket money app because his kids were still too young to get bank cards from traditional banks.\n\nWith prepaid debit cards linked to the app, Hall\u2019s kids, aged 8 and 10, can spend their allowance and chore money by shopping online or by tapping at contactless payment terminals in stores. Sound like a recipe for splurging? Not so, he said.\n\n\u201cWhen kids have cash they want to spend it quickly. They want to go to the shops and spend it on rubbish,\u201d said Hall, an IT project manager. But an app lets them check their balances online, \u201cwhich actually makes them start thinking about saving rather than getting rid of the money,\u201d said Hall, who also prefers giving digital allowances because he never carries cash.\n\nThe app, which is called gohenry and expanded to the U.S. in April, is part of a wave of digital money apps combined with prepaid cards for kids as young as six that parents have access to. They are powerful new money management and savings tools that replace old-fashioned piggy banks and account passbooks. Some say they can help enhance financial literacy even as the growth of cashless payments upends traditional notions of money.\n\nGlobally, the number of non-cash transactions rose 11.2 percent to 433 billion in 2015 from the year before and is forecast to nearly double by 2020, according to the World Payments Report by financial services firms Capgemini and BNP Paribas. Britain, Canada and Sweden are among the world\u2019s most cashless countries, according to a 2017 ranking by currency website ForexBonuses, with widespread use of \u201ccontactless\u201d bank cards that let shoppers merely tap on payment terminals for small transactions.\n\nIn China, where mobile payments rule, Alipay and WeChat Pay allow teens to hold accounts. Hong Kong offers a kids\u2019 version of its stored value Octopus card, based on older technology.\n\nIn the U.S., the fragmented banking sector means most cards still need to be swiped and, sometimes, require a pin number. Merchants in big U.S. cities are increasingly going cashless because they can gather more customer data, which makes it harder for teens without bank cards, said Stuart Sopp, CEO of Current, a two-year-old U.S. fintech startup.\n\n\u201cParents are willing to pay to solve a problem that banks are not solving\u201d - helping youngsters deal with digital money, said Sopp.\n\nCurrent , gohenry and others such as Britain\u2019s Nimbl and Osper , Australia\u2019s Spriggy and Famzoo and Greenlight of the U.S. operate on similar principles. They typically charge a monthly or annual fee for prepaid debit cards. Parents can load money from their bank onto their own account, set weekly allowance amounts and spending limits, list chores to earn extra money, and block certain types of transactions, like online shopping.\n\nMoney is sent to kids\u2019 linked accounts, which they can use to set savings goals. The Current app rounds up each transaction and sweeps the change into a savings account.\n\nCrucially, the apps send instant alerts about transactions, a feature parents love, said gohenry CEO Alex Zivoder.\n\n\u201cYou give cash to a kid, how do you as a parent know what he will do with this money?\u201d he said.\n\nHall said his son, Ralph, 8, uses it to save up to buy 70 pound ($92) soccer shoes and PlayStation video games while his daughter Lilly, 10, saves for shoes or clothing. They both also save up to buy extras on the video game Fortnite.\n\nHe said he turned to the app because \u201cI want them to understand what the value of money is.\u201d\n\nThe apps are making inroads amid growing adult uncertainty about how the shift to cashless payments is affecting children\u2019s view of money. In one U.K. survey commissioned last year by Prudential, about 78 percent of teachers and 37 percent of parents said it hurt youngsters\u2019 understanding of money.\n\nMore than a quarter felt contactless cards encouraged them to spend more and didn\u2019t help them develop mental arithmetic skills as well as handling cash, the poll of 501 parents found. No margin of error was given.\n\nThey\u2019re valid concerns, said Russell Winnard, head of programs and services at financial education charity Young Money, a charity, but he added that apps can help parents explain to children how money works.\n\n\u201cYoung people are seeing less and less cash transactions, which just means that we have to be even more careful to talk about what is happening at each of those stages, because it has become more abstract,\u201d said Winnard.\n\nPaddy Kelly, another gohenry user, says he started using it because he was looking for a better way to help his 8-year-old daughter, Ailish, both save money and improve her math skills.\n\nShe had a piggy bank full of coins but her younger brother kept emptying it, Kelly said.\n\nHe likes the app\u2019s savings feature, which his daughter has used to set a goal of saving 20 pounds, at 2 pounds per week, with the aim of buying a pet gerbil. Getting her to figure out how long it would take to reach that goal is better than forcing her to do abstract math questions, which just makes her \u201cirate,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt gets her thinking about money in a slightly smarter way,\u201d said Kelly. \u201cMoney is such an abstract concept, in today\u2019s world it kind of makes sense\u201d for kids to use digital pocket money apps, he said.\n\n___\n\nFollow Kelvin Chan on Twitter at www.twitter.com/chanman", "FILE - In this Oct. 10, 2018 file photo German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer arrives for the weekly cabinet meeting of the German government at the chancellery in Berlin.

(AP Photo/Tsvangirayi Mukwazhi)\n\nHARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) \u2014 One year ago the unthinkable happened in Zimbabwe: Robert Mugabe fell from power.\n\nTanks rolled in the streets of the capital, Harare, on Nov. 14, 2017, and the military put Mugabe under house arrest, in reaction to Mugabe\u2019s firing of Vice President Emmerson Mnangagwa.\n\nHundreds of thousands of Zimbabweans danced in the streets to celebrate the end of Mugabe\u2019s repressive rule that had brought ruin to the once prosperous economy. Mugabe, then 93, soon resigned, ending his 37-year rule.\n\nA year later Zimbabwe\u2019s economic problems have worsened and restrictions on basic freedoms remain, bringing some Zimbabweans to ask \u2018What has changed?\u2019 and \u2018Are things better?\u2019\n\nThe euphoria at Mugabe\u2019s fall has evaporated. Mnangagwa promised Zimbabwe \u201ca new dawn\u201d but to many the country looks depressingly familiar with long lines at the banks to withdraw paltry amounts of cash and shortages of basic goods have led to the rationing of cooking oil, bottled water and beer.\n\n\u201cThey played us, we marched for nothing,\u201d Adrea Magoronye, a Harare resident said as she stood in a line for cooking oil at a supermarket.\n\nMnangagwa started well but his disputed election victory in July, followed by the military opening fire and shooting dead six civilians, a cholera outbreak and an economic implosion have cast a pall over the 76-year-old\u2019s first year in power.\n\nMnangagwa promised to turn the collapsed economy into a middle-class one by 2030, underpinned by democratic reform and reengagement with the U.S. and other Western countries that placed sanctions during Mugabe\u2019s time.\n\nThose sanctions have not yet been lifted and the signs are not reassuring. In September, inflation climbed to its highest since 2010, according to Zimstat, the national statistics agency.\n\nDrugs are in short supply in a country where the health system has long been on the brink of collapse.

People fear a return to that hyperinflation.\n\nThe new currency shortage has forced the government to rely on the printing of bond notes, which are rapidly losing value. The government has also been paying civil servants through electronic funds that show up in bank accounts but cannot be turned into cash. There is also a system of mobile money. All of which are devaluing quickly against the U.S. dollar on the black market.\n\n\u201cThe government hasn\u2019t moved in the new direction any distance yet,\u201d said Harare based economic consultant John Robertson.\n\n\u201cThere is no improvement in liquidity, no improvement in foreign reserves either borrowed or earned and no improvement in investment inflows so it is becoming increasingly disappointing.

Rival Libyan administrations jockey for power, militias clash in often deadly bids to boost prestige and influence, and human traffickers exploit the chaos to pursue their lucrative business from their base in the North African country.\n\nArriving a few hours before a closed working dinner to begin the conference, Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte told reporters the conference aims to \u201chelp end the armed conflicts and to help the Libyan stabilization process\u201d in the framework of the United Nations.\n\nEventually, the West hopes Libyans will have a democratic election, but the conference isn\u2019t aiming to fix a date. \u201cWe want the Libyan people to be able to democratically decide their own future,\u201d Conte said.\n\nThere was skepticism on how much progress might be made toward stability at the conference in a luxury seaside hotel in large part because it wasn\u2019t clear if a key player, Gen. Khalifa Hifter, commander of the self-styled Libyan National Army with a power base in eastern Libya, would meet with his Libyan rivals in plenary sessions set for Tuesday.\n\nConte warmly shook hands with Hifter as he greeted guests arriving for the dinner session.\n\nLibya plunged into chaos after the 2011 uprising that ousted and killed longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi, and it is now governed by rival administrations in the east and west with both relying on the support of militias.\n\nIt has also become a haven for Islamic militants and armed groups, including several from neighboring countries, which survive on looting and human trafficking, particularly in the remote south of the country.\n\nConte met on Monday with Ghassan Salame, the U.N. special envoy to Libya, who last week told the U.N. Security Council that the \u201cstatus quo in Libya was untenable\u201d with the country.\n\nOne of Salame\u2019s other meetings on conference sidelines saw him exchange views on political developments with Fayez Serraj, the prime minister of the U.N.-backed government in Tripoli and a chief rival of Hifter.\n\nItaly has been a staunch Serraj backer.\n\nLibya\u2019s neighbor to the east, Egypt, backs Hifter. Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, among the participants, had recently reiterated Cairo\u2019s call for lifting the international arms embargo against Libya.\n\nIn an interview published Monday in Italian daily La Stampa, Conte portrayed the gathering as an opportunity to \u201csustain the creation and deployment of regular armed forces and security forces.\u201d\n\nFor rights advocates, the conference posed another kind of opportunity: To draw attention to the plight of migrants trapped in Libya, now that the nearly nightly launching of human traffickers\u2019 boats from Libya\u2019s coasts has sharply dropped off as Italy and Malta have closed their ports to private rescue groups\u2019 vessels.\n\n\u201cAmnesty International is calling on all those taking part in the conference to ensure that human rights of all people in the country, including refugees and migrants, are placed at the center of their negotiations,\u201d the rights group said in a statement.\n\nIt decried that Libya has \u201crepeatedly delayed\u201d the opening of a long-promised processing center for the U.N. refugees organization, to relocate refugees from \u201cabusive detention centers.\u201d\n\nWith Libya\u2019s rich oil and gas resources, energy-rivals Italy and France have been jockeying for influence.\n\nFrance hosted a meeting on Libya in May, when rival Libyan leaders tentatively agreed on a roadmap for parliamentary and presidential elections but declined to sign a declaration outlining their commitments.\n\nConte\u2019s six-month-old government \u2014 and especially anti-migrant Interior Minister Matteo Salvini \u2014 sees a more stable and secure Libya as the best outcome for Italians, and for the right-wing voter base in particular.\n\nHifter has been instrumental in the fight against militants, going after them in their eastern hideouts and occasionally foraying into the vast and largely lawless south.

May faces increasing domestic pressure over her proposals for an agreement following the resignation of another government minister last week.\n\nThe British leader had been hoping to present a draft deal to her Cabinet this week. But no Brexit breakthrough was announced Monday after talks between European affairs ministers. The two sides are locked in technical negotiations to try to bridge the final gaps in a move laden with heavy political and economic consequences.\n\nMay said talks were in their \u201cendgame\u201d but that negotiating a divorce agreement after more than four decades of British EU membership was \u201cimmensely difficult.\u201d\n\nMay told an audience at the Lord Mayor\u2019s Banquet in London that \u201cwe are working extremely hard, through the night, to make progress on the remaining issues in the Withdrawal Agreement, which are significant.\n\n\u201cBoth sides want to reach an agreement,\u201d May said, though she added she wouldn\u2019t sign up to \u201cagreement at any cost.\u201d\n\nThe main obstacle to a deal is how to keep goods flowing smoothly across the border between EU country Ireland and Northern Ireland in the U.K.\n\nBoth sides have committed to avoid a hard border with costly and time-consuming checks that would hamper business. Any new customs posts on the border could also re-ignite lingering sectarian tensions. But Britain and the EU haven\u2019t agreed on how to achieve that goal.\n\n\u201cClearly this is a very important week for Brexit negotiations,\u201d Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney told reporters after the meeting in Brussels. \u201cThe two negotiating teams have really intensified their engagement ... There is still clearly work to do.\u201d\n\nAnd Martin Callanan, a minister in Britain\u2019s Brexit department, said all involved were \u201cstraining every sinew to make sure that we get a deal but we have to get a deal that is right for the U.K., right for the EU and one that would be acceptable to the U.K. Parliament.\u201d\n\nEU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier didn\u2019t speak to reporters Monday and a planned news conference with him was canceled.\n\nInstead, EU headquarters issued a short statement saying that Barnier explained to the ministers that \u201cintense negotiating efforts continue, but an agreement has not been reached yet.\u201d\n\nDutch Foreign Minister Stef Blok said the two sides \u201care getting closer to each other.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut in negotiations there is only a deal if there is full agreement,\u201d Blok said. \u201cThere is only a 100-percent deal. There is not a 90-percent deal or a 95-percent deal.\u201d\n\nEarlier, France\u2019s EU affairs minister, Nathalie Loiseau, stepped up pressure on May. \u201cThe ball is in the British court. It is a question of a British political decision,\u201d she said.\n\nThe EU is awaiting Barnier\u2019s signal as to whether sufficient progress has been made to call an EU summit to seal a deal.\n\nRumors have swirled of a possible top-level meeting at the end of November. But Austrian EU affairs minister Gernot Bluemel, whose country holds the EU\u2019s rotating presidency, said \u201cso far progress is not sufficient to call in and set up another (summit).\u201d\n\nIn recent days there have been signs of progress behind the scenes, but all parties have remained tight-lipped about the developments, given the politically charged atmosphere.\n\nIn Britain, pro-Brexit and pro-EU politicians alike warned May that the deal she seeks is likely to be shot down by Parliament.\n\nBoris Johnson, a staunch Brexit supporter, wrote in a column for Monday\u2019s Daily Telegraph that May\u2019s plan to adhere closely to EU regulations in return for a trade deal and an open Irish border amounts to \u201ctotal surrender\u201d to the bloc.\n\nThe proposed terms are scarcely more popular with advocates of continued EU membership.\n\nFormer Education Secretary Justine Greening on Monday called May\u2019s proposals the \u201cworst of all worlds,\u201d and said the public should be allowed to vote on Britain\u2019s departure again.\n\n\u201cWe should be planning as to how we can put this final say on Brexit in the hands of the British people,\u201d Greening told the BBC.\n\nJohnson\u2019s younger brother, Jo Johnson, resigned last week backing calls for a second referendum on whether the country should leave the EU.

OPEC and allied oil-producing countries likely need to cut crude supplies to rebalance the market after proposed U.S. sanctions on Iran failed to cut Tehran's ouput, top Saudi and Emirati energy officials said Monday. (AP Photo/Kamran Jebreili)\n\nABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) \u2014 OPEC and allied oil-producing countries will likely need to cut crude supplies, perhaps by as much as 1 million barrels of oil a day, to rebalance the market after U.S. sanctions on Iran failed to cut Tehran\u2019s output, Saudi Arabia\u2019s energy minister said Monday.\n\nThe comments from the minister, Khalid al-Falih, show the balancing act the U.S. allies face in dealing with President Donald Trump\u2019s actions related to the oil industry.\n\nTrump in recent weeks demanded the oil cartel increase production to drive down U.S. gasoline prices. \u201cHopefully, Saudi Arabia and OPEC will not be cutting oil production. Oil prices should be much lower based on supply!\u201d he tweeted Monday.\n\nThe U.S. has meanwhile allowed some of its allies \u2014 Greece, India, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Turkey \u2014 as well as rival China to continue to purchase Iranian oil despite re-imposed sanctions, as long as they work to reduce their imports to zero.\n\nAl-Falih, who on Sunday said the kingdom would cut production by over 500,000 barrels per day in December, said Monday that Saudi Arabia had been giving customers \u201c100 percent of what they asked for.\u201d That appeared to be a veiled reference to Trump.\n\nBefore the United States re-imposed sanctions on Iran, \u201cfear and anxiety gripped the market,\u201d al-Falih said at the Abu Dhabi International Petroleum Exhibition & Conference. Now \u201cwe\u2019re seeing the pendulum swing violently to the other side,\u201d he added.\n\nThe energy minister of the United Arab Emirates, Suhail al-Mazrouei, currently the president of OPEC, said \u201cchanges\u201d likely would be necessary as the oil cartel meets in December in Vienna. However, he added: \u201cWe need not to overreact when these things happen.\u201d\n\nAl-Falih said OPEC officials have seen analysis papers suggesting a production cut of upward of 1 million barrels of crude a day may be necessary to rebalance the market. However, he stressed that more study needed to be done.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of assumptions in their projections that may change,\u201d al-Falih said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to throttle the global economy.\u201d\n\nA gallon of regular gasoline in the U.S. on average now sells for $2.69, down from $2.90 a month ago, according to AAA. Those lower prices likely quieted Trump, but production cuts could again boost prices at the pump.\n\nNeither al-Falih nor al-Mazrouei directly criticized Trump, but Mohammed Hamad al-Rumhy, Oman\u2019s oil and gas minister, blamed the U.S. president for some of the volatility striking the oil market. Oman, a sultanate on the eastern edge of the Arabian Peninsula, maintains close diplomatic ties to Iran and often serves as an interlocutor between Western powers and Tehran.\n\n\u201cSupply and demand is perhaps the easy part because you can measure it,\u201d al-Rumhy said. It\u2019s \u201cextremely difficult to quantify what is happening in (the) White House \u2014 almost impossible.\u201d\n\nIran, which has tense relations with Abu Dhabi, the capital of the UAE, did not have a high-level official at the summit.\n\nCrude oil dropped to a low of $30 a barrel in January 2016. That forced OPEC to partner with non-OPEC countries, including Russia, to cut production to help prices rebound.\n\nBenchmark Brent crude, which had been trading above $80 a barrel recently, now hovers just over $70 after the U.S. sanction waivers on Iran.\n\nMeanwhile, Sultan Ahmed al-Jaber, the head of the state-run Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., said the UAE planned to increase oil production to 4 million barrels a day by 2020 and 5 million barrels a day by 2030. The UAE now produces some 3 million barrels of oil a day.\n\nAl-Jaber also said the UAE would begin fracking \u2014 injecting high-pressure mixtures of water, sand or gravel and chemicals \u2014 to gain access to otherwise unreachable natural gas reserves.\n\n\u201cMake no mistake: Hydrocarbons will continue to play an absolutely essential part of a diversified energy mix,\u201d al-Jaber said.\n\nBut the highs and lows of the market need to end for both oil consumers and producers to profit, said al-Rumhy, the Omani official.\n\n\u201cIf it was my heart beat going that way, I think I would be in the hospital right now,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nFollow Jon Gambrell on Twitter at www.twitter.com/jongambrellap .", "NEWARK, Del.

We wanted to look at curriculums that would put our middle schoolers on the right path to develop skills for these industries,\u201d Zajic said.\n\nThe program offers a combination of curriculum and assessment, hardware and software. The classroom is what used to the former woodshop, and one will not find a teacher standing in front of the class lecturing the students. Instead, autonomy is encouraged and collaboration among the students is the norm.\n\n\u201cThe students come in and set a goal to create or make something. They have to complete the goal and then we reflect on what they have worked on,\u201d math teacher Sara Stelke said. \u201cI am actually considered a facilitator in the Smart Lab.

Hopefully we will have some kids from here that start designing a new school app for us one day.\u201d\n\nThe kids also learn to work with user manuals, do research online and gain valuable problem solving skills.\n\n\u201cIt helps children learn how to do stuff on their own and help others build their confidence. Every day, you are exploring something new and learning more every single day. I think it\u2019s a really good knowledge builder,\u201d said student Brooklyn Smith.\n\nEvery sixth-grader can register for the exploratory course that covers about three or four modules and lasts a quarter of a semester. The eighth-grade program is offered as a more in-depth elective and lasts two quarters of a semester.\n\n\u201cIf everything goes as planned, we should be able to get kids interested in certain aspects of this program into high school classes, which will put them into college classes either at MTI or others.

Rick Scott, whose lead in the Senate race over incumbent Democrat Bill Nelson has narrowed with the counting of provisional and other ballots. They asked for additional sheriff\u2019s deputies to be sent to Snipes\u2019 office to monitor ballots and voting machines.\n\nState law requires a machine recount in races where the margin is less than 0.5 percentage points. In the Senate race, Scott\u2019s lead over Nelson was 0.14 percentage points. In the governor\u2019s contest, unofficial results showed Republican former Rep.

He said the recount need not be rushed because the next governor does not take office until January.\n\nIn their Broward request, Scott\u2019s lawyers alleged that Snipes was engaging in \u201csuspect and unlawful vote counting practices\u201d that violate state law and that she might \u201cdestroy evidence of any errors, accidents or unlawful conduct.\u201d The motion was supported by lawyers representing the state Republican Party and opposed by Snipes\u2019 office, Nelson\u2019s campaign and the state Democratic Party.\n\n\u201cI am urging because of the highly public nature of this case to ramp down the rhetoric,\u201d Tuter said.\n\n\u201cIf someone in this lawsuit or someone in this county has evidence of voter fraud or irregularities at the supervisor\u2019s office, they should report it to their local law enforcement officer,\u201d Tuter said. \u201cIf the lawyers are aware of it, they should swear out an affidavit. But everything the lawyers are saying out there in front of the elections office is being beamed all over the country. We need to be careful of what we say.

Common Cause and the League of Women Voters sought to remove Scott from any role in the recount.\n\nBipartisan experts agree that voter fraud is a rare phenomenon across the nation. That didn\u2019t stop protests outside Snipes\u2019 office, where a mostly Republican crowd gathered, holding signs, listening to country music and occasionally chanting \u201clock her up,\u201d referring to Snipes.

Vivian Stringer moved within one victory of 1,000 as women\u2019s college basketball tipped off its season.\n\nWhalen took over at her alma mater Minnesota this year and led the Gophers to an opening win in front of an announced crowd of 14,625. It was the most ever to watch a women\u2019s basketball game at Williams Arena. They had a lot to cheer about as the Gophers beat New Hampshire by 23 points.\n\n\u201cHey, that was fun,\u201d Whalen said to the crowd from midcourt after the game Friday night.\n\nThe Gophers have a shot to earn their first ranking under Whalen on Monday. They were 26th in the preseason poll.\n\nWhile Whalen was celebrating her first win, hours earlier on Friday Stringer earned No. 999 with Rutgers\u2019 win over Stony Brook. She\u2019ll have her first chance at 1,000 on Tuesday night against Central Connecticut State. A win would put the Hall of Fame coach in the company of Pat Summitt, Geno Auriemma, Sylvia Hatchell and Tara VanDerveer as Division I women\u2019s basketball coaches who have won 1,000 games.\n\nIt took Stringer\u2019s Rutgers team five tries to get her win No. 900 in 2013. With many family, friends and former players coming Tuesday night, she hopes the Scarlet Knights can do it on their first try this time.\n\n\u201cI just want to get it over with,\u201d Stringer admitted. \u201cIt\u2019s the best way for me to say that. I think that\u2019s what happened with 900, they were trying so hard to do it, you\u2019d think it was the first game we played. They were really nervous to get it done.\u201d\n\nHere are other things that happened in women\u2019s college basketball this past week:\n\nRECORD ROUT: Savannah State set a school scoring record in their season opening 155-26 win over Wesleyan. The 155 points broke the old mark set during the 1975-76 season when the Lady Tigers beat Georgia Tech 141-18. It also was the most scored by a NCAA Division I team since 1987, when Long Beach State beat San Jose State 149-69.\n\nThe 129-point win also set an NCAA Division I margin of victory record, surpassing 108 points set in 2016 when Baylor defeated Winthrop 140-32. It is important to note that team Savannah State beat is a Division III program.\n\nSophomore Jacquece Alston recorded a triple-double for Savannah State with 13 points, 12 assists and 12 steals. She also had seven rebounds.\n\nREWRITING THE RECORD BOOK: Oregon junior guard Sabrina Ionescu picked up where she left off with her NCAA record 11th career triple-double in the No. 3 Ducks season opening win at Alaska.\n\nShe had 18 points, 12 assists and 11 rebounds for the Ducks, who were playing the game as a homecoming for Ruthy Hebard.\n\nSOLID RANKINGS: The opening week saw the Top 25 teams only lose a game to a team not ranked when No. 21 Duke fell at Northwestern. The rest of the ranked teams were 39-0 against non-ranked foes.\n\n___\n\nFollow Doug on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/dougfeinberg\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "", "Pittsburgh running back Qadree Ollison (30) starts to sommersault as he goes into the end zone for a touchdown after a 97-yard run from scrimmage against Virginia Tech in the fourth quarter of an NCAA football game, Saturday, Nov. 10, 2018, in Pittsburgh.

Leroy Richardson got caught up in a bit of basketball politics when he was in the U.S. Navy. He had just transferred off the USS Yellowstone to a shore facility in Virginia, was looking to play for one of the intramural teams there and eventually got told that all the available spots had been taken by members of another command. So he decided to start refereeing. Almost 30 years later, he's still in the NBA. (AP Photo/Carlos Osorio, File)\n\nLeroy Richardson got caught up in a bit of basketball politics when he was in the U.S. Navy. He had just transferred from the USS Yellowstone to a shore facility in Virginia, was looking to play for one of the intramural teams there and eventually got told that all the available spots had been taken by members of another command.\n\nSo he decided to start refereeing.\n\nAlmost 30 years later, he\u2019s still in the NBA.\n\nVeterans Day \u2014 which was observed Sunday in the U.S. though federal agencies were closed Monday \u2014 carries obvious additional significance for people like Richardson and fellow NBA refs Rodney Mott and Matt Boland. All three served their country in the military; Richardson was a Navy man for 12 years, Mott for three years and Boland was in the Connecticut National Guard from 1987 through 1995.\n\nRichardson knows how lucky he is. If he was picked for that intramural team, he probably wouldn\u2019t have started officiating. If he hadn\u2019t started, he wouldn\u2019t be in the NBA.\n\n\u201cEverything was sort of preordained,\u201d Richardson said.\n\nMott feels the same way. He had a chance to accept a basketball scholarship in his hometown of Buffalo, New York, but decided to pursue a military career first. He went to San Diego State after leaving the Navy in 1979, got a degree in aeronautical engineering, landed a job at McDonnell Douglas and stayed in the game through a bit of coaching.\n\nSomeone approached him and said he\u2019d make a good referee. Before long, Mott \u2014 who spent a lot of time in Southern California playing with NBA guys like Michael Cage and Randy Smith and eventual Baseball Hall of Famer Tony Gwynn (who was an excellent point guard before turning his energy toward baseball) \u2014 was learning the ref trade in a camp run by then-NBA ref Hue Hollins.\n\n\u201cThe rest is history,\u201d Mott said. \u201cI\u2019m happy with the choice that I made. Very happy. Refereeing has been very good. It\u2019s kept me close to the game. I could play, but I\u2019m a better referee than I was a player.\u201d\n\nRichardson and Mott have heard \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d countless times before games over the years.\n\nIt never gets old. To them, the anthem still resonates.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s special,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cI\u2019m proud, not to be recognized but to have represented. When I hear that anthem, you realize that you were part of something that\u2019s held in reverence. I look around the arenas, there\u2019s a lot of times where they recognize all veterans and ask them to stand, and I\u2019m proud to be standing as well.\u201d\n\nTHE TRADE\n\nJimmy Butler going to Philadelphia, a deal that becomes official on Monday, means the 76ers might have three All-Stars in the same season \u2014 something they haven\u2019t had in more than 30 years.\n\nButler, fellow returning All-Star Joel Embiid and probable All-Star Ben Simmons are expected to be headed to Charlotte this February for the league\u2019s midseason showcase. The last time Philly sent three to an All-Star Game was when Julius Erving, Charles Barkley and Maurice Cheeks went in 1987.\n\nA little bit has changed since then:\n\n\u2014 That game was in Seattle, which no longer is in the NBA.\n\n\u2014 The league had 23 teams, as opposed to the 30 it has now.\n\n\u2014 That was also the last season where every NBA team averaged at least 100 points per game. This season, the league is on pace for that to happen again.\n\nDONCIC WATCH\n\nIt\u2019s not fair to anoint someone rookie of the year less than a month into the season, though Dallas\u2019 Luka Doncic certainly looks the part.\n\nOnly three other rookies whose first NBA games came as teenagers \u2014 LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony and Kevin Durant \u2014 finished their debut seasons averaging at least 20 points. Doncic, the Mavericks\u2019 19-year-old budding star, might have a shot to join that very exclusive club.\n\nSo far, he\u2019s averaging 20.3 points, along with 6.5 rebounds and 4.5 assists. The only three players who finished their rookie seasons with those averages in all three categories are Michael Jordan, Larry Bird and Oscar Robertson.\n\n\u201cMy opinion is that he doesn\u2019t have a limit,\u201d Mavs forward Maxi Kleber said. \u201cLuka can do whatever. You can already tell now because of the way he plays and how efficient he is. You can tell that he\u2019s a very special talent.\u201d\n\nDoncic is fully aware that he\u2019s already in top-rookie conversations. He\u2019s trying not to listen.\n\n\u201cYeah, of course it would be special, but for me it\u2019s always for the team,\u201d Doncic said. \u201cOf course I want to enter the playoffs first. That\u2019s my goal, and later the individual stuff.\u201d\n\nTHE WEEK AHEAD\n\nSomething to watch for every day of this week ...\n\n\u2014 Magic at Wizards, Monday: Washington has way, way too much talent to be off to a 3-9 start.\n\n\u2014 Hornets at Cavaliers, Tuesday: Charlotte already has a 32-point win over Cleveland this season.\n\n\u2014 Pistons at Raptors, Wednesday: Toronto fans will do the right thing and warmly greet Dwane Casey.\n\n\u2014 Warriors at Rockets, Thursday: The clubs\u2019 first meeting since the 2018 Western Conference finals.\n\n\u2014 Kings at Grizzlies, Friday: Too early to know if either team is for real, but they\u2019ve started off well.\n\n\u2014 Jazz at Celtics, Saturday: Gordon Hayward won\u2019t be subjected to boos during warmups in this one.\n\n\u2014 Lakers at Heat, Sunday: LeBron James makes his lone 2018-19 trip to Miami, where he won two titles.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "", "", "Buffalo Bills tight end Jason Croom (80) recovers a fumble by wide receiver Zay Jones , left, for a touchdown against the New York Jets during the first quarter of an NFL football game, Sunday, Nov. 11, 2018, in East Rutherford, N.J. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig)\n\nTo say the Jets , Raiders and Bucs have quit would be hyperbole.\n\nTo say their fans are ready to quit watching them would be more accurate.\n\nThere was little to nothing worth mentioning about their performances Sunday in one-sided defeats. In the New York and Tampa Bay areas, much of the chatter will be about removing Todd Bowles and Dirk Koetter as head coaches of their respective outfits. At least Jon Gruden won\u2019t be worrying about job security with a Raiders team he has torn asunder, and he has the job security to rebuild.\n\nBowles got it right at the New Jersey Meadowlands by saying following a 41-10 embarrassment at the hands of the previously-inept-on-offense Buffalo: \u201cWe stunk it up as coaches, we stunk it up as players.\u201d\n\nHis team certainly represented what used to be swamp land quite well Sunday.\n\nThe Jets (3-7, losers of four in a row) were blitzed from the beginning by a quarterback, Matt Barkley, who was unemployed a few days ago, and has been a journeyman for almost his entire NFL stint; this was his 12th game since 2013. They were overrun by LeSean McCoy, which is fine except when you consider he was in a horrendous slump and hadn\u2019t scored all season.\n\nWorst, they seemed apathetic and disinterested from the start, a strong indictment of the players and the coaches.\n\n\u201cThey just came in and just straight, flat out, beat us,\u201d said Jets receiver Jermaine Kearse, who has had to adjust to lots of losing in New York after lots of winning while he was with the Seahawks. \u201cI wish I could give you an explanation. It\u2019s frustrating for all of us, but they just came in here and straight beat us.\u201d\n\nMaybe because the Bills were trying a whole lot harder?\n\n\u201cNobody\u2019s quit on anybody,\u201d Kearse added. \u201cWe win together, we lose together and that\u2019s everybody\u2019s mindset right now. We\u2019re all not perfect, we\u2019re out here trying to figure it out and find ways to improve this situation like anybody else. So, I would think that\u2019s far from the truth.\u201d\n\nThe Jets have never fired a coach during the season since the Johnson family bought the franchise in 2000. At least Bowles seems to have that going for him.\n\nKoetter is in his third season in charge in Tampa, and he\u2019s supposedly an offensive mastermind. Until being manhandled by Washington, the Bucs were tearing it up when they had the ball. Maybe somebody tore up all the play sheets that worked previously because they scored a mere three points against a team struggling with injuries.\n\nOffensive coordinator Todd Monken had been calling plays, but Koetter took over against the Redskins. He wouldn\u2019t explain why, but clearly it was a bogus decision.\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t good enough as a team, and that starts with me,\u201d Koetter said. \u201cTo move the ball like that and come up with three points, you\u2019re just not going to win that way.\u201d\n\nTampa (3-6) has the second-longest playoff drought, 10 seasons, and Koetter\u2019s chances of breaking that string are diminishing rapidly.\n\nNo such worries for Gruden, whose return to Oakland has been a fiasco so far. Give him credit for all the high draft picks the Raiders will have in April, and maybe for the high prospects they will carry into Las Vegas when they move in 2020.\n\nFor now, though, well \u2014 pardon us on this one \u2014 they\u2019ve fallen into a Black Hole.\n\n\u201cThis will be a year that a lot of us will never forget,\u201d Gruden said of his 1-8 team that has been outscored 75-9 in the past nine quarters in what has quickly become a lost season. \u201cIt\u2019s painful. It\u2019s really hard. It\u2019s painful. It\u2019s going to be hard to sleep again, hard to get up in the morning.\u201d\n\nWhen Gruden gets up, he\u2019ll perhaps look at others to get rid of as he retools the roster already missing Khalil Mack, Bruce Irvin and Amari Cooper. He\u2019s got that wildly lucrative 10-year contract, virtual total control of personnel and no qualms about doing pretty much anything.\n\nWhat must hurt fans of these three teams that got hammered Sunday is that the effort from other losing clubs \u2014 Arizona, which tested powerful Kansas City; Cleveland, which stunned Atlanta; and, of course, Buffalo \u2014 was so strong, so admirable. Perhaps the worst sign for a struggling team is when it looks lost, lethargic and lacking skill on the field.\n\nIn New Jersey and the Tampa and Oakland bay areas, that\u2019s exactly what the fans saw in Week 10.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "New York Jets head coach Todd Bowles, right, greets Buffalo Bills head coach Sean McDermott after an NFL football game, Sunday, Nov. 11, 2018, in East Rutherford, N.J.

Consider that the Jets now head into a bye week. So that might make sense as a time to make a change for a club that had zero fight in it during a 41-10 loss Sunday against the visiting Buffalo Bills and quarterback Matt Barkley, of all people.\n\n\u201cWe stunk it up as coaches,\u201d Bowles said. \u201cWe stunk it up as players.\u201d\n\nAll true.\n\nHere\u2019s another comment that was rather telling: \u201cThat\u2019s the first time I felt like somebody really smacked us,\u201d Jets cornerback Morris Claiborne said, \u201cand we didn\u2019t do nothing about it.\u201d\n\nKeep in mind that the Bills are nothing special. Barkley is worse than that \u2014 a has-been who never was, nearly two years removed from his most recent NFL start. But defensive guru Bowles couldn\u2019t come up with anything to stop the guy.\n\nNow the Jets are 3-7 and heading in the wrong direction, losers of four straight games.\n\nBowles shouldn\u2019t stand alone in terms of questions about how much longer he will \u2014 or should \u2014 last in his current job.\n\nAs embarrassing as the Jets suddenly are, Bowles is hardly the only coach whose club is looking unprepared and unable to compete lately:\n\n\u2014 Doug Marrone\u2019s Jacksonville Jaguars somehow immediately went from AFC runners-up to also-rans, dropping five consecutive games to fall to 3-6 after a 29-26 loss to the Indianapolis Colts;\n\n\u2014 Dirk Koetter\u2019s Tampa Bay Buccaneers somehow beat the New Orleans Saints and Philadelphia Eagles in Weeks 1 and 2 but have lost six of seven games since to sit at 3-6 after a 16-3 setback against the visiting Washington Redskins;\n\n\u2014 Jon Gruden is not going anywhere anytime soon, of course, but his Oakland Raiders are as bad as it gets right now, going to 1-8 after losing five games in a row by at least 14 points each, the latest a 20-6 defeat at home against the Los Angeles Chargers.\n\n\u201cThis will be a year that a lot of us will never forget,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cIt\u2019s painful.\u201d\n\nJets fans probably feel the same way about their season.\n\nIn case you missed it, here are other top topics after the NFL season\u2019s 10th Sunday:\n\nROAD, SWEET ROAD\n\nWashington Redskins cornerback Josh Norman celebrated a road victory by blasting the NFC East leaders\u2019 home fans, saying it seems like they \u201cjust don\u2019t really care; they just boo everything and aren\u2019t really behind us.\u201d Washington is 3-1 in away games, 3-2 at home. \u201cWe can play all the games on the road, if you ask me,\u201d said Norman, who had an acrobatic interception early, one of four turnovers forced by Washington\u2019s defense against the Bucs. Later, Norman sent out a tweet encouraging spectators to be more supportive and enthusiastic at home. After all, with a 6-3 record, a two-game division lead over the surprisingly so-so Super Bowl champion Eagles and the Cowboys (both 4-5 after Dallas beat Philadelphia 27-20 with the help of a hurdle by Ezekiel Elliott) and an easy schedule the rest of the way, the Redskins would host a playoff game if they avoid a collapse.\n\n6-3 1st NFC-EasT, 1st time in along time that in itself should be \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffd We worked on our craft to get here.

The organizations in charge of Olympic sports in the U.S. face complicated demands from everyone from elite athletes down to grassroots volunteers. They have limited resources and staffs that often can\u2019t handle many challenges. It\u2019s no wonder, then, that turnover is rampant in some of the highest-profile jobs. (AP Photo/Gero Breloer, file)\n\nSoon after he accepted the thankless task of trying to rebuild the sprawling, fractured operation at USA Track and Field, Doug Logan received a one-line text from the NBA commissioner at the time, David Stern: \u201cYou only take the easy ones.\u201d\n\nLogan laughed. Deep down, the former commissioner of Major League Soccer knew if he did what was necessary, he\u2019d make enemies and be gone in a few years.\n\nHe lasted 26 months \u2014 not very surprising given the world of Olympic-style politics, infighting, limited resources and multilayered demands he walked into.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s the old cliche of \u2018low risk, high reward,\u2018\u201d Logan said. \u201cTaking a job like that, it\u2019s \u2018high risk, low reward.\u2019\u201d\n\nAs the new CEO of the U.S. Olympic Committee, Sarah Hirshland, or any of the three recently ousted leaders of USA Gymnastics can attest to, the task of running an organization in the U.S. Olympic world looks like a job description from hell:\n\nWanted: Take-no-prisoners sports-and-business expert to run not-for-profit sports team in which you have no say in picking the players, and cannot pay them, either.\n\nSalary: $1 million a year if you\u2019re lucky.\n\nKey challenges: Ensure athlete safety, both from abusers and day-to-day injuries common to your sport. Keep hundreds of grassroots clubs, thousands of volunteers and hundreds of thousands of recreational participants happy.\n\nAlso: From those grassroots programs, maintain a high-functioning, elite program guaranteed to win medals each year at world championships and Olympics.\n\nBonus: Be ready, at any given moment, to answer to the government, which ultimately controls your future but has vowed not to spend a penny toward furthering your success.\n\nIf you succeed, you get to keep your job. For a while, at least.\n\nUltimately, neither the USA Gymnastics board of directors nor the two leaders it chose to reboot the federation were up to these tasks. That led Hirshland to call for the dismantling of the national governing body (NGB) torn apart by a sex-abuse scandal it couldn\u2019t prevent, recognize or rebuild from. Hirshland\u2019s own future will be decided in part by what the USOC does to replace the agency it seeks to tear apart.\n\nUSA Gymnastics is only one of 50 national governing bodies \u2014 all with differing sizes, agendas, budgets and staffs \u2014 but with this common thread:\n\n\u201cYou have to not only look for ways to grow your sport, but also for ways to support your sport at the highest level,\u201d said Rich Bender, the CEO of USA Wrestling. \u201cAt times, you can get conflicted. One of the realities is, those NGBs that have found success have been able to marry the two.\u201d\n\nWhen Congress adopted the Ted Stevens Amateur Sports Act in 1978, its main motivation was to wrest control of the individual sports from the grip of the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU), which regulated most Olympic sports and often adopted rules that didn\u2019t allow them to function well at the highest levels.\n\nThe law, likely to be revisited and tweaked in the wake of the sex-abuse scandal, established the modern-day USOC and gave it authority to choose which organizations would oversee the dozens of sports on the Olympic program.\n\nThose organizations, the annual revenues of which fall in the range of anywhere from $750,000 (USA Badminton) to $35 million (USA Track and Field, US Ski and Snowboard), are in control of much more than producing gold-medal Olympians, however.\n\n\u201cA lot of these NGBs have an executive, and he or she is doing press releases, folding towels and making sure they have a place to stay at the Olympics,\u201d said Bob Condron, a longtime Olympic insider who worked at the USOC. \u201cA lot don\u2019t have the resources to do what they\u2019re supposed to do.\u201d\n\nJim Scherr, the former CEO of the USOC, ticked off no fewer than a dozen roles a typical NGB has to fulfill.\n\nAmong them: managing youth sports; developing athlete pipelines; liaising with the NCAA, which is a key part of that pipeline in the United States; marketing, promoting and delivering local programs and services; event management, both local and national; fundraising; sponsorship; media; ticketing; licensing; managing hundreds of volunteers whose only compensation are recognition and occasional access to events.\n\nBoard members that oversee the staff and set the direction of the organization are volunteers \u2014 usually not well versed in most, if not all, of these areas.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a cycle,\u201d Scherr said. \u201cBoards will focus for a while on athletic performance and hire someone who\u2019s an expert there. Then, they\u2019ll say, \u2018We\u2019ve lost sight of the bottom line,\u2019 and the sports person will get replaced with someone they think can steward those resources. Then, that will get solidified and they\u2019ll want someone who can drive media rights.\n\n\u201cThen, eventually, the focus shifts back to sports.\u201d\n\nUntil, that is, the cycle is interrupted by an unexpected crisis, which is where USA Gymnastics and, to some extent, the USOC, now find themselves.\n\nSex abuse has, for now, replaced doping as the crisis that most Olympic organizations were not built to deal with. As the dig-out begins, Hirshland will have to find a leader for gymnastics who, first and foremost, understands the need to shift the focus to athlete safety \u2014 with some concrete actions to put behind the words. It is, even in this fraught time, not an area of expertise for most sports executives.\n\nThe last time this big an NGB was in this sort of peril came when Logan was hired, not long after the USOC threatened to cut off funding or decertify a federation it deemed to be poorly run by an unwieldy board of directors.\n\nLogan cleaned house and tried to get a grip on a volunteer operation that many felt had gotten out of control. He also created a panel to assess why the team won a paltry 23 medals in track and field at the Beijing Olympics.\n\nIn the end, he was gone, and replaced by Max Siegel, a marketing veteran with NASCAR ties who has received equal doses of love and hate for his signature business accomplishment while at the helm \u2014 a 23-year extension on the sponsorship deal with Nike worth more than $450 million.\n\nThe U.S. team has won 29 (2012) and 32 (2016) Olympic medals under his watch.\n\nBut he has no illusions that these jobs are easy \u2014 or forever.\n\n\u201cWhen people approach it by saying, \u2018It\u2019s a (not-for-profit),\u2019 the implication is that it\u2019s a charitable organization,\u201d Siegel said. \u201cBut that\u2019s not the case, and running a public entity that has commercial objectives are not missions that go hand-in-hand. It\u2019s a constant challenge and it is a built-in tension.\u201d\n\nSiegel, now in his seventh year at the helm of one of the toughest NGBs out there, is a rare exception.\n\nThe chilling fact is that almost everyone who has tried one of these jobs since the current framework was established in the 1970s has been shown the door \u2014 often in far less than seven years. Scherr said the USOC conducted a survey while he was CEO and found that, excluding a few outliers, the average tenure of an NGB executive was around 18 months.\n\n\u201cIt takes a particular lunatic, like me, to be incented to do them,\u201d Logan said. \u201cBut the thing that is exciting about them is the great challenge.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "NORTH PORT, Fla.

(Jill Schramm /Minot Daily News via AP)\n\nMINOT, N.D. (AP) \u2014 Working behind the scenes, Souris Basin Planning Council often isn\u2019t the first agency to come to mind when contemplating economic development. But millions of dollars have come to the region for infrastructure projects that have spurred development because of the involvement of the planning council.\n\n\u201cWe are here to make everybody else\u2019s life easier,\u201d SBPC Executive Director Lyndsay Ulrickson said. \u201cOnce somebody works with us once or twice, they understand the value of the services we provide. Oftentimes we try to make it so easy on the end user they have no idea what we have done.\u201d\n\nThe planning council aims to change that anonymity a bit as it seeks to engage the public in an update of its five-year comprehensive economic development strategy. The council has held regional meetings and conducted a roundtable with community stakeholders in partnership with Dakota Business Lending and the Bank of North Dakota. An online survey collected public thoughts.\n\nThe council tentatively plans to have a draft plan completed by Nov. 15, the Minot Daily News reported. A 30-day public comment period will follow, and the hope is that people will respond.\n\n\u201cWe truly want to hear what people have to say and what their thoughts are. We want it to be relevant to what people need and what people want throughout the region,\u201d Ulrickson said.\n\nWhile many people might wonder what SBPC does, Ulrickson noted the organization is busier now than ever in her seven years with the agency.\n\nSBPC is a government nonprofit, established through state executive order as one of eight regional planning councils in North Dakota. However, there is no state funding.\n\nSBPC, organized in 1972, is funded with a $70,000 grant from the Economic Development Administration that is matched by local funds from member counties of Bottineau, Burke, McHenry, Mountrail, Renville, Pierce and Ward. The planning council also receives some operating funds from grants as grant administrator for specific projects.\n\nSBPC describes its purpose as being responsive to the needs of local governments and other development interests. Overseen by a local board, the council accomplishes its mission by providing guidance and assistance in problem solving, information sharing, partnership building and advocating local government needs with local, regional, state and federal entities \u2014 all led by a professional staff.\n\n\u201cWe are here because we are passionate about what we do,\u201d Ulrickson said of the four-member staff. \u201cThere\u2019s lot of opportunity out there right now, and we just try to do what we can with our small staff.\u201d\n\nIn the past five years, SBPC has helped Minot secure about $30 million in funding, including $18 million from the Economic Development Administration for the downtown infrastructure project. SBPC assisted the city with a $1.8 million grant for North Hill infrastructure that enabled that area of the city to grow commercially and residentially, creating more than 250 jobs, Ulrickson said.\n\nSBPC also has had significant impact on Minot through its business loan programs. SBPC manages a revolving loan fund that provides gap financing to businesses in partnership with bank lenders.\n\n\u201cOur whole purpose is to find the gaps that exist within our community and find the resources that fill the gaps. If there are no resources, it\u2019s our job to create one,\u201d Ulrickson said.\n\nThat\u2019s how the revolving loan fund came about. The fund now has a loan portfolio of about $2 million. Assistance is available to any new or expanding business that commits at least a 10 percent investment and meets other loan criteria.\n\nSBPC has aided a number of area communities through various grant programs.\n\nTwo years ago, SBPC received a $70,000 grant from USDA Rural Development for a housing redevelopment program for low-income homeowners in Pierce County.

(AP Photo/Pervez Masih, File)\n\nISLAMABAD (AP) \u2014 The Pakistani government, already struggling with a crisis surrounding a Christian woman acquitted of blasphemy charges after eight years on death row, now has to deal with \u201cfake\u201d images on social media purporting to show her outside the country.\n\nThe deceptive images have prompted death threats to a lawmaker shown in one photograph, and are likely intended to whip up radical religious fervor over Aasia Bibi\u2019s case. It\u2019s unclear who is behind the circulation of the images.\n\nRadical Islamists have held mass protests and demanded that she be publicly executed. They\u2019ve also filed a petition to repeal her Supreme Court acquittal. The government says Bibi remains in Pakistan, at a secret location for her own protection, until the review process is finished.\n\nPrime Minister Imran Khan has warned hard-line groups against using her plight to further their political aims with street protests.\n\nHe has defended the Supreme Court judges who on Oct. 21 acquitted the 54-year old mother of five of blasphemy charges. But he has also acquiesced to demands by the Islamists that the acquittal be reviewed in an appeal process.\n\nBlasphemy is a highly charged issue in Pakistan, where mere allegations of insulting Islam or the Prophet Muhammad can incite mobs into a frenzy of violence. The charge carries the death penalty, and critics say the blasphemy law is abused to settle religious scores.\n\nInformation Minister Fawad Chaudhry slammed the \u201cfake\u201d postings on Monday, one of which claims to show Bibi meeting Pope Francis. The photo is actually of Bibi\u2019s daughter from two years ago. Bibi and her family have always maintained her innocence and say she never insulted Islam\u2019s prophet.\n\nChaudhry said the images misidentifying Bibi prompted death threats to a lawmaker in one photograph, Fazal Khan from the ruling Tehreek-e-Insaf Party. The lawmaker\u2019s constituency is in a deeply conservative region in the country\u2019s northwest.\n\n\u201cPeople can even be killed because of such fake postings,\u201d Chaudhry said. The pictures were widely circulated on social media in Pakistan and shared on several local journalists\u2019 groups, even a police and a media group.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to seek cooperation from Twitter and Facebook against such fake news,\u201d Chaudhry added.\n\nBibi\u2019s ordeal dates back to 2009 when she went to fetch water for herself and fellow farmworkers. An argument took place after two Muslim women refused to drink from the same container as Bibi, who is Roman Catholic. The women later said Bibi had insulted the Prophet Muhammad, and she was charged with blasphemy. She was put on trial, convicted and sentenced to death in 2010.\n\nFollowing Bibi\u2019s acquittal last month, the founder of the radical Tehreek-e-Labbak Party, Mohammed Afzal Qadri, issued a fatwa calling for the death of the three Supreme Court judges who handed down the acquittal and the overthrow of Khan\u2019s government. He also incited the military to mutiny.\n\nIn 2011, the governor of Punjab province was killed by his own guard after he defended Bibi and criticized the blasphemy law. A year later, the minister for minorities was shot and killed.\n\nBibi, who was freed from detention last week, is being held at a secret, closely guarded location in Pakistan. Those who are familiar with her circumstances say she is expected to remain there until the Supreme Court carries out the review.\n\nOn Sunday, the prime minister said the Supreme Court\u2019s decision would be final. For now, it\u2019s unclear when the review will be held or who would defend Bibi. Her lawyer, Saiful Malook, fled the country following her acquittal, fearing for his life.", "A currency trader works near the screens showing the Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI), left, and the foreign exchange rate between U.S. dollar and South Korean won at the foreign exchange dealing room in Seoul, South Korea, Monday, Nov. 12, 2018.

In Israel, the national rescue service said at least 20 people were wounded, including a 19-year-old soldier and a 60-year-old woman who were in critical condition.\n\nEarly Tuesday, Israeli media reported that a man was found dead under the rubble of a building in the southern coastal city of Ashkelon hit by Gaza rockets.\n\nGaza\u2019s health ministry, meanwhile, said a 22-year-old Palestinian who was wounded in an earlier airstrike died, putting the Palestinian death toll since the current flare-up started late Sunday to 11, the majority of them militants.\n\nThe fighting cast doubt over recent understandings brokered by Egypt and U.N. officials to reduce tensions. Just a day earlier, Israel\u2019s prime minister had defended those understandings, saying he was doing everything possible to avoid another war.\n\nThe United Nations said it was working with Egypt to broker a halt in the violence. \u201cRockets must STOP, restraint must be shown by all!\u201d the U.N. Mideast envoy\u2019s office tweeted.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, meanwhile, urged Israel and the Palestinians \u201cto exercise maximum restraint,\u201d according to a statement.\n\nThe rocket fire was triggered by a botched Israeli military raid in Gaza on Sunday. Undercover troops, apparently on a reconnaissance mission, were discovered inside Gaza on Sunday, setting off a battle that left seven militants, including a Hamas commander, and an Israeli military officer dead.\n\nAround sundown Monday, militants launched some 100 rockets in less than an hour, the most intense barrage since the 50-day war four years ago. The outgoing rockets, which continued into the evening, lit up the skies of Gaza and set off air raid sirens throughout southern Israel.\n\nBy early Tuesday, at least 300 rockets had been launched from Gaza, the Israeli military said, adding that up to 70 of them were intercepted by the anti-missile defense system Iron Dome.\n\nThe military said warplanes, helicopters and tanks had struck over 70 militant targets, including military compounds, observation posts and weapons facilities. It also said it targeted a squad that was launching rockets.\n\nThe airstrikes and rocket barrages resumed at dawn after nearly two hours of calm.\n\nLt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, a military spokesman, said the army had sent additional infantry troops, rocket defense systems and intelligence units to the Gaza frontier.\n\n\u201cWe continue to strike and retaliate against the military targets belonging to terrorist organizations in Gaza, and as for our intentions we will enhance these efforts as needed,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nLate Monday, an airstrike destroyed the Gaza City headquarters of Hamas\u2019 Al Aqsa TV station. Israel had fired warning shots ahead of the airstrike, prompting the station to halt programming and replace it with a logo. Minutes later, the airstrike flattened the three-story building and the station went black.\n\nWorkers had evacuated the building after the warning shots, and there were no immediate reports of casualties.\n\nHamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum condemned the bombing as \u201ca barbaric, brazen aggression.\u201d Ten minutes later, the station resumed broadcasts, airing prerecorded national songs.\n\nIsrael said the station \u201cbroadcasts violent propaganda\u201d and provides \u201coperational messaging\u201d to militants. A five-story office building that housed Hamas media offices and another building used by Hamas\u2019 internal security service were also destroyed. No casualties were reported.\n\nHamas and the smaller militant group Islamic Jihad said the rocket fire was revenge for Sunday night\u2019s Israeli incursion. Islamic Jihad spokesman Daoud Shehab said the groups wanted \u201cthe occupation and its supporters know that the lives of our sons come with a price.\u201d\n\nIn all, well over 300 rockets were fired into Israel by midnight, the army said. The Israeli military said it intercepted 70 rockets, and most of the others fell in open spaces. But rockets landed in the southern Israeli town of Sderot, setting off a large fire near a shopping center. Several homes were hit in southern towns, including one that was destroyed in Ashkelon. Around midnight, a rocket struck another building in Ashkelon, wounding at least 10 people, including one woman in critical condition, according to police and rescue workers.\n\nEarlier, a bus was struck by an anti-tank missile, critically wounding a 19-year-old soldier. The strike set the bus on fire, sending a large plume of black smoke over the area. Gaza militants released a video of what they said was the attack, showing a bus pulling up to an open area before going up in flames. The video, with ominous music playing, showed Israeli soldiers milling about the area.\n\nMichael Oren, an Israeli Cabinet minister, said Israel \u201cwill do whatever it takes\u201d to defend itself. \u201cWe expect the world to stand with us,\u201d he said.\n\nThe EU\u2019s ambassador to Israel, Emanuele Giaufret, called for a halt in \u201cindiscriminate\u201d rocket fire toward civilians. \u201cEveryone must step back from the brink,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier Monday, thousands of Palestinian mourners buried the seven militants killed in Sunday\u2019s incursion. Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh led a funeral as masked gunmen in uniforms carried coffins and mourners chanted \u201crevenge.\u201d\n\nHamas set up checkpoints across Gaza in a show of force. It also restricted movement through crossings with Israel, preventing foreign journalists, local businessmen and some aid workers from leaving the territory.\n\nHamas also canceled a weekly beach protest in northwestern Gaza along the border with Israel. The organizers cited \u201cthe ongoing security situation.\u201d\n\nIsrael and Hamas have fought three wars since the Islamic militant group seized control of Gaza from the internationally-backed Palestinian Authority in 2007. In the most recent war, over 2,200 Palestinians were killed, more than half of them civilians, and tens of thousands were left homeless. Seventy-three people were killed on the Israeli side.\n\nIsrael and Egypt have maintained a blockade on Gaza since the Hamas takeover. The blockade has devastated Gaza\u2019s economy.\n\nFor over seven months, Hamas has been leading protests along the Israeli border aimed in large part at breaking the blockade. More than 170 Palestinians, most unarmed, have been killed by Israeli fire during the protests. Israel says it is defending its border against militant infiltration attempts.\n\nIn recent weeks, Egyptian and U.N. mediators had appeared to make progress in brokering informal understandings aimed at quieting the situation.\n\nLast week, Israel allowed Qatar to deliver $15 million to Gaza to allow cash-strapped Hamas to pay the salaries of thousands of government workers. At the same time, Hamas has lowered the intensity of the border protests in recent weeks.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cut short a visit to Paris because of the flare-up and returned to Israel on Monday for consultations with top security officials.\n\nThe Hamas military wing said that in Sunday\u2019s incursion, Israeli undercover forces drove about 3 kilometers (2 miles) into southeastern Gaza and shot and killed a mid-level commander in the southern Gaza town of Khan Younis. Hamas militants discovered the car and chased it, prompting Israeli airstrikes that killed several people, the group said.\n\nThe military provided few details about Sunday\u2019s raid. The Israeli military chief, Lt. Gen. Gadi Eisenkot, said a \u201cspecial force\u201d carried out \u201ca very meaningful operation to Israel\u2019s security,\u201d without elaborating.\n\nIn a tweet after his arrival back home, Netanyahu praised the slain officer, whose identity was kept confidential for security reasons, and said \u201cour forces acted courageously.\u201d The officer\u2019s funeral was held Monday.\n\nOn Sunday, Netanyahu defended his decision to allow through the Qatari cash to Gaza as a way to avert an \u201cunnecessary war,\u201d maintain quiet for residents of southern Israel and prevent a humanitarian catastrophe in the impoverished Gaza Strip.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Fares Akram reported in Gaza City and AP writer Josef Federman reported from Jerusalem.

Jones hit the locker room like a politician stumping for votes, shaking hands with anyone within reach.\n\n\u201cNow that was a win, I\u2019ll tell you right now,\u201d he said to a small circle of Cowboys.\n\nThe Cowboys are just 4-5 but the victory steadied a franchise that saw Garrett again under fire and Hall of Fame quarterback Troy Aikman call for major organizational changes for a franchise far removed from the Super Bowl heyday.\n\nElliott and Dak Prescott quieted the doubters after a dazzling Sunday that put the champion Eagles\u2019 season on the rocks.\n\n\u201cYou can imagine the way Jason Garrett, his resolve before the game,\u201d Jones said. \u201cI asked him before the game, \u2018You feeling any pressure?\u2019 (Garrett replied) \u2018It just makes me want to go out and do more to turn this thing.\u2019\u201d\n\nElliott made highlight reels and kept the Dallas\u2019 NFC East title hopes alive when he extended a play in the first half. The Cowboys tried a fake punt on fourth-and-2 from their 31 and Jeff Heath took a direct snap and ran three yards. A few plays later, Elliott hurdled Tre Sullivan on a 32-yard run to the Eagles 8. Michael Bennett sacked Prescott on third down and Brett Maher kicked a 31-yard field goal for a 6-0 lead.\n\nWas it Elliott\u2019s best bound over a defender?\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll leave that up to you guys to decide,\u201d Elliott said.\n\nJones was positive it was Elliott\u2019s finest.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen him make that move before,\u201d Jones said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know when I\u2019ve ever seen him totally clear it.\u201d\n\nWhile the Super Bowl champions are reeling, the Cowboys didn\u2019t exactly look a serious threat to the NFC East crown. Prescott had 270 yards passing, tossed for one touchdown and also ran for a score. Elliott also had a TD reception , against an Eagles secondary depleted by injury.\n\nThe Cowboys will need a win at Atlanta (4-5) next week and then a win Nov. 22 against division-leading Washington to really establish themselves as a playoff contender. It\u2019s a leap of faith larger than anything attempted by Elliott that the Cowboys can wrest their way into the NFC playoff picture.\n\nBut for a night, it was enough.\n\n\u201cWe had no choice but to win,\u201d said Elliott, who cupped his hand to his ear as he walked off the field to boos.\n\nGarrett, who has yet to lead Dallas to even an NFC title game, knew the magnitude of the rivalry game.\n\n\u201cWe were in a challenging situation,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had to come up here and win a football game.\u201d\n\nBoth teams felt the pressure even before former President George W. Bush performed the coin toss . The Cowboys and Eagles got into a small pregame scuffle that ended on the sideline before players were ushered back into the tunnel.\n\nDallas took a 10-3 lead into the half before Elliott and Prescott got rolling. Elliott ran in from the 1 to give Dallas a 27-20 lead after Prescott completed passes of 24 yards to Amari Cooper and 23 yards to Allen Hurns on the drive.\n\nIt was the kind of drive that might have impressed Aikman. Aikman, who won three Super Bowls with the Cowboys, said this week \u201dthere has to be a complete overhaul of the entire organization .\u201d\n\nThe Cowboys just shrugged it off as just another controversy that didn\u2019t concern them.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re Dallas Cowboys.

Standard Lithium CEO Robert Mintak said the ultimate goal is to extract the lithium and then refine it, all in Arkansas.\n\nHe added that the Arkansas Oil & Gas Commission is giving his company a chance to prove its process by operating the pilot extraction plant with a waiver.\n\n\u201cThe purpose is to prove that we can extract lithium with our selective extraction plan, and then produce battery-grade material in Arkansas,\u201d Mintak told Arkansas Business in a recent telephone conversation. \u201cThe purpose is to have everything in Arkansas,\u201d with the pilot extraction technology in place in the first half of 2019.\n\n\u201cThat plant is going to be moved to Arkansas probably in late February or early March,\u201d Mintak said. \u201cThat\u2019s the extraction pilot plant. The pilot plant in Richmond, on the other hand, is a plant that converts the extracted lithium solution into a final battery material. We\u2019ve developed our own process to crystallize lithium carbonate, and we feel our own process may be an improvement, but we\u2019re going to be working with some other industry partners that have crystallizers in use around the world. We\u2019ll be testing our own process along with others.\u201d\n\nSaltworks CEO and chief engineer Ben Sparrow said in a statement that if Standard Lithium likes the results it sees at the pilot plant in Canada, \u201cwe are ready to rapidly deliver a mobile fully continuous plant and support Standard Lithium to commercialize this high-potential technology.\u201d\n\nMintak has cited Arkansas\u2019 regulatory environment, as well as its vast supply of mineral-dense brine, as factors that led Standard Lithium to Arkansas.\n\n\u201cWe had a meeting with the Oil & Gas Commission a week ago and gave a presentation to proceed with a waiver,\u201d Mintak said. \u201cThere is not a royalty set as yet for lithium in Arkansas, so they\u2019re allowing us to prove the extraction process works as we operate the pilot plant. Then as we get data on that we\u2019ll start working with them on the royalty regime.\u201d\n\nStandard Lithium is listed on Canada\u2019s TSC Venture exchange under the trading symbol SLL and on the OTCQX under the symbol STLHF.

I\u2019ll cover you.\u2019\u201d\n\nConaway was 21 years old when he watched his comrade and fellow member of Company F, 2nd Battalion, 1st Marines, 1st Marine Division (Reinforced), Joe Vittori, conduct a \u201cvaliant stand\u201d against the enemy in Korea.\n\nVittori\u2019s courage and sacrifice would earn the automatic-rifleman the highest and most prestigious personal military decoration in the United States \u2014 the Congressional Medal of Honor.\n\nPfc. Conaway, wounded in the battle, would receive the Navy Cross for his gallantry.\n\nConaway would live to tell about it \u2014 that nightmarish night in 1951 that claimed his buddy\u2019s life.\n\nThe story of Hill 749.\n\nIn April 2017, Conaway relayed the story during interviews in California to producers of \u201cMedal of Honor,\u201d which will be released this month on the streaming service Netflix.\n\nThe series \u2014 the work of Academy Award-winning Executive Producer Robert Zemeckis (\u201cForest Gump\u201d) and Academy-Award winning Director James Moll (\u201cThe Last Days\u201d) \u2014 portrays the stories of eight recipients of the Medal of Honor.\n\nIt is part documentary with eyewitness interviews; part action footage with recreations of the events. In the series, actor Matt O\u2019Leary portrays Conaway; Vittori is played by Steven R. McQueen, grandson of actor Steve McQueen.\n\nIn the trailer interviewees comment on the Medal of Honor distinction: \u201cIt\u2019s the ultimate form of recognition for courage on the battlefield. Anyone who receives it is immediately held as a hero like none other,\u201d \u2033It represents the worst day of your life,\u201d and \u201cThey have earned it, and earned it the hard way.\u201d\n\nConaway sits in his garage workshop where the aviator who rebuilt seven planes in his lifetime \u2014 including five Stearman biplanes \u2014 now creates handmade ribbon-winning model airplanes.\n\nPhotos of him by the planes in which he flew aerobatics are pinned on the wall above bottles of paint and glue and woodworking tools.\n\nThe G.I. Bill contributed to his opportunity to learn how to fly, said Conaway, a father of eight, grandfather to 14 and a great-grandfather of 10.\n\nPhotos from his military days are also tacked up around the workshop.\n\nConaway enlisted in the service when he was not quite 16 years old and is technically a veteran of World War II, although \u201ccombat had ended\u201d by that time, he explaind.\n\nThe minimum age to enlist then was 16 with parental consent, and Conaway said he would have signed up earlier if he knew he could have gotten away with it.\n\nHis pride in the Marine Corps is obvious in his surroundings, and when he speaks of his service his passion is equally evident.\n\nAs he recounts his harrowing experience on Hill 749, he is frequently overcome with emotion. At times he also lets up because, \u201cI\u2019m getting ahead of myself.\u201d\n\nAlthough Conaway participated in the \u201cMedal of Honor\u201d series, he makes it clear he is no fan of the limelight.\n\nBut his story is part of American history, and when a representative with the Medal of Honor Society approached him to share his memories, Conaway obliged.\n\nBesides, his fellow Marine \u2014 who gave of his life to service of his country at age 22 and was awarded the Medal of Honor posthumously \u2014 deserves the recognition.\n\nHill 749, near Songnea-dong, Korea, was named for its height in meters.\n\nThe Korean People\u2019s Army had established several entrenched positions on Hill 749, and on Sept. 15-16, 1951, Conaway and Vittori volunteered to move forward to defend a heavy machine gun located on the extreme point of the northern flank.\n\nVittori, from Massachusetts, already decorated with two Purple Hearts after being wounded in action, \u201cwas supposed to go home. But he volunteered to stay,\u201d Conaway said.\n\n\u201cI knew there would be fighting, but I didn\u2019t know it would be that bad,\u201d he remembers.\n\nConaway and Vittori spent the night protecting the unit\u2019s machine guns, Conaway with an M1 semi-automatic rifle, Thompson submachine gun and hand grenades; Vittori with a Browning Automatic Rifle.\n\nHe remembers a corporal with the Second Platoon yelling, \u201cJoe, what are you doing up here?\u201d\n\nVittori responded: \u201cYou know the Second Platoon always needs help.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you looking for a Purple Heart?\u201d the corporal continued.\n\n\u201cI got one already. But I\u2019d like to have the Congressional Medal of Honor,\u201d Vittori answered.\n\nConaway remembered a \u201cflash on the hill above us.\u201d The North Koreans had opened fire with a 76-mm gun. The shell hissed toward them, exploding in the treetops and showering them with shrapnel.\n\n\u201cI hunkered down in the hole.\u201d\n\n\u201cBang, bang, bang,\u201d Conaway recounted. \u201cShrapnel flying.\u201d A fourth round exploded near the first officer\u2019s foxhole, and someone shouted, \u201cHe\u2019s dead!\u201d\n\n\u201cThings were happening too fast,\u201d Conaway said.\n\nA spotter plane flew over and called in artillery and then the firing stopped.\n\nThe Marines had barely slept in days, and Vittori told Conaway to \u201cget some sleep.\u201d\n\nConaway laid down in the fox hole. The next thing he remembers is Vittori shaking him awake. \u201cHere they come! Here they come!\u201d\n\n\u201cI just couldn\u2019t wake up,\u201d Conaway recalled. But \u201cthere was so much noise. So much sound.\u201d\n\nEveryone began firing. There were \u201cflashes\u201d everywhere. \u201cI fired a couple rounds.\u201d\n\nNext thing he knew, Conaway had been hit in the head and face from a concussive blast. He stood up instinctively and caught a few slugs in the shoulder.\n\n\u201cI knew I was hit bad. I looked for Joe but I couldn\u2019t see him. I thought, \u2018I\u2019m blind,\u2019\u201d Conaway recounted. He said he began to sob. \u201cThe tears washed the blood out of my eyes and I could see.\u201d\n\nConaway remembered, \u201cJoe kept firing.\u201d But when he went to fire his own rifle, it was jammed. He remembered he had hand grenades and, despite his injuries, he began pulling the pins with his right hand and throwing with his left arm.\n\nConaway then recognized the sound of rifle fire hitting flesh and realized Vitorri had been hit in the chest. But Vitorri kept firing.\n\nA machine gun hit by a grenade had ignited leaves and grass nearby. \u201cThere was so much fire,\u201d Conaway said. \u201cI looked back and could see bullets kicking up.\u201d\n\nConaway recalls Vitorri firing right over his head and ducking as low as he could with the muzzle of the BAR only inches from his ears. Conaway said he then remembered he had his Thompson at the bottom of the hole and went after it.\n\nVittori went to another hole and was hit again.\n\nSuddenly, \u201ceverything grew quiet,\u201d Conaway said. He thought he had lost his hearing.\n\nVittori told Conaway, \u201cWe can\u2019t hold \u2019em. We have to get back.\u201d Conaway said his buddy told him to go since he thought Conaway was hurt more. \u201cYou go. I\u2019ll cover you,\u201d he told Conaway.\n\nConaway remembers \u201cmy leg quivered\u201d as he tried to move. \u201cI was scared.\u201d\n\nVittori told him again: \u201cYou go. I\u2019ll cover you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI heard a crack. A swish. A splat.\u201d Vittori\u2019s head snapped back, Conaway said, squeezing his eyes shut tightly. He paused, then continued.\n\nConaway said he remembers stumbling down the hill and falling into a fox hole, yet bleeding from his wounds.\n\nEventually reinforcements arrived. Conaway told someone, \u201cJoe\u2019s dead.\u201d\n\nThe 21-year-old Conaway was eventually shipped to a hospital in Japan, where he spent 30 days recovering before returning to home.\n\nAccording to the book, \u201cThe Korean War: Uncertain Victory,\u201d the 1st Marines finally secured Hill 749 at 6 p.m. Sept. 16, 1951. \u201cIt has cost them 90 dead and 714 wounded. Enemy losses were 771 known dead and 81 taken prisoner.\u201d\n\nA citation accompanying Cpl. Joseph Vittori\u2019s posthumous presentation of the Medal of Honor reads in part: \u201cCorporal Vittori, by his fortitude, stouthearted courage and great personal valor, had kept the point intact despite the tremendous odds and undoubtedly prevented the entire battalion position from collapsing.\n\n\u201cHis extraordinary heroism throughout the furious night-long battle reflects the highest credit upon himself and the United States Naval Service. He gallantly gave his life for his country.\u201d\n\nIn 1942, an act of Congress placed the Navy Cross just beneath the Medal of Honor and limited its award to combat-only recognition.\n\nThe citation presented with Pfc. Lyle Conaway\u2019s Navy Cross medal reads in part: \u201cAlthough sustaining serious wounds, Private First Class Conaway steadfastly refused to be evacuated and continued his valiant stand against the enemy until he was too weak to fight any longer.\n\n\u201cBy his indomitable spirit and great personal valor in the face of tremendous odds, he contributed immeasurably to the repulse of the hostile force. His inspiring actions were in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.\u201d\n\nConaway remembered looking up at the night sky during one point after stumbling away from Hill 749.\n\n\u201cI could see the stars. I thought, \u2018Those are the same stars we see at home.\u2019\u201d\n\nTears flowed that night, he said, as he \u201cthought about all the brave men I met.\u201d\n\nThe former Marine, always a Marine at heart, continues to think about those brave heroes, particularly his buddy Joe Vittori.\n\n\u201cWhat a rugged path it was,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Mesabi Daily News, http://www.virginiamn.com", "Mollie Allen of Kasson is the recipient of a 5-month-old Angus calf in a contest held by the Minnesota Beef producers. The new calf, Piper, will join Mollie and her father's growing herd at her grandfather's farm near Dodge Center. (Randi Kallas/The Rochester Post-Bulletin via AP)\n\nKASSON, Minn. (AP) \u2014 While Mollie Allen may live just two blocks from Kasson-Mantorville High School, her heart is on the farm.\n\nSpecifically, her grandfather\u2019s farm near Dodge Center where there are chickens, goats, a horse, ducks, rabbits and three heifers, two purchased by Allen in the last year. Both are pregnant; one will calve in February and the other in April.\n\nThe high school junior also is a winner in the Minnesota Beef competition in which she was awarded a Simmental-Angus calf to add to her herd. She won, in part, by writing an essay explaining why she needed a heifer and how it would improve her life.\n\n\u201cIt was a hard paper to write \u2014 to explain all that stuff. But I just love it,\u201d she said Oct. 20 at Minnesota Beef Expo at the Minnesota State Fairgrounds.\n\nOwning cattle is a big responsibility and Minnesota Beef makes sure its young winners raise their calves right. Winners must submit paperwork every three months, including farm records detailing feed, costs, veterinarian visits and other items. If the paperwork is not submitted, the calf is taken away.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine,\u201d Allen told Agri News , shaking her head slowly.\n\nAllen\u2019s new calf, named Piper, will join Lonette and Windchime, on grandpa\u2019s farm and begin a regimen of conditioning that could lead her to the show ring. When she\u2019s 14 months old \u2014 she\u2019s 5 months now \u2014 she\u2019ll be old enough to breed. Two straws of semen for artificial insemination are part of the Minnesota Beef prize.\n\nThe show ring is where Lonette, a \u201cblue\u201d Simmental-short horn mix, was Oct. 21 for Minnesota Beef\u2019s competition. While Lonette didn\u2019t bring home any ribbons, Allen was happy to show the gray heifer.\n\n\u201cI love showing cattle,\u201d Allen said.\n\nShe credits Mark and Donna Moenning and their daughters Mary and Martha for mentoring her on how to show animals, as well as writing a letter of recommendation for the Minnesota Beef contest.\n\n\u201cShe wrote a beautiful letter,\u201d Mollie Allen\u2019s mother Jean Allen said of the Moennings. \u201cThe things she said, just beautiful.\u201d\n\nShowing animals has changed Mollie Allen, too, Jean Allen said.\n\n\u201cTo see her confidence and her dedication change and grow as part of this is beautiful,\u201d she said. \u201cTo see your child transform so in a short time is something else.\u201d\n\nThe growing herd has created stronger ties in the Allen family which also includes Mollie Allen\u2019s father and cattle partner Lyle, and brother DJ Allen. While illness keeps grandpa from being the primary caregiver for the animals, he loves seeing them every day.\n\n\u201cHe goes out and calls Windchime, and she comes up to him. It\u2019s so cute,\u201d Jean Allen said.\n\nThe cattle require a lot of attention from Mollie Allen. She washes them twice a day in order to get their hair to fluff and stand better in the show ring \u2014 blow drying a cow with an overgrown hairdryer takes at least an hour \u2014 getting them used to wearing a halter and walking calmly on a lead, as well as feeding.\n\nBeing that they are breeding stock, they get a dry mix of three types of feed and each heifer eats about 23 pounds a day. Lyle Allen guesstimates Lonette weighs 1,600 pounds now.\n\n\u201cThe cattle have really brought us together,\u201d Jean Allen said. \u201cWe all spend a lot of time together with them, and that\u2019s time that we may not have spent together as a family.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Agri News, http://www.agrinews.com/", "FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. (AP) \u2014 Dozens of Fayetteville teens will learn about 3-D printing, laser cutting, woodworking and more as part of the Northwest Arkansas Fab Lab\u2019s \u201cTech for Teens\u201d after-school program in January.\n\nSteve Clark, president and chief executive officer of the Fayetteville Chamber of Commerce, led a news conference at the lab recently to announce a $10,000 grant from the Best Buy Foundation to pay for the program.\n\nThe program is intended primarily for \u201cunderserved\u201d kids, including those who are economically disadvantaged and those with physical or learning disabilities, Clark said. It will be free to the students, the Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported.\n\n\u201cThose are the students who are the workforce of tomorrow,\u201d he said.\n\nAbout 120 students ages 13-17 will be invited to the lab for four hours a week during three-week sessions that will take place over the course of the spring semester. They will be allowed access to the lab free of charge throughout the semester even when they aren\u2019t part of the session. Admission to the lab normally costs $10 for a day. There\u2019s a monthly rate of $20 for students and $30 for adults.\n\nTech for Teens students will be trained on all the equipment in the lab. Clark predicted the program will change their lives.\n\nThe lab, which opened in 2016 just off the downtown square and is operated by the chamber, serves the community as a maker space where people may tinker and use a variety of tools. Some high school students were using the laser cutter recently to carve images into pumpkins.\n\nWhitney Green, a former teacher who runs the lab, said the lab attracts anywhere between 30 and 100 people per week. The grant from Best Buy is the largest the lab has received. She believes Tech for Teens will expose the kids to career possibilities.\n\n\u201cToo many kids don\u2019t have a clue what to do with their lives,\u201d Green said. \u201cA lot of that is because they just don\u2019t know what\u2019s out there.\u201d\n\nShe added a lot of kids who hate school love the experiences they get at the lab.\n\nJosh Watson teaches a computer science class for high school kids through Northwest Technical Institute. He brings his students to the lab about once every two weeks.\n\n\u201cThe great thing about this place is we get a break away from the book for a minute. They get to use their imaginations here,\u201d Watson said.\n\nRyan Cook, a 17-year-old Farmington High School student enrolled in Watson\u2019s class, said he enjoys coming up with ideas of things to make in the lab.\n\n\u201cThe more you come here and do something, the more you want to come here each week, or each day even,\u201d Cook said.\n\nShania Cardenas, 17, of Lincoln High School was using a table saw as part of a woodworking project. The lab is a fun chance to try a variety of tools, she said.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of fun people here too,\u201d Cardenas said. \u201cSo it\u2019s a good experience to just meet other people and chat with them.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, http://www.nwaonline.com", "MIDLAND, Mich. (AP) \u2014 Just a few yards from the Chippewa Nature Center visitor center, adjacent to the parking lot is The Woods Nature Play Area. After a soft open this summer, The Woods is now available for kids of all ages to interact with nature and each other.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a concept we\u2019ve had for a number of years. We\u2019ve had a couple of grants come through which enabled us to move forward on it,\u201d said Jenn Kirts, director of programs. She went on to thank the support of the Dow Corning Donor Advised Fund through the Midland Area Community Foundation and the Midland Rotary Foundation.\n\nThe thought behind the play area came from the staff talking to parents who visit CNC. They shared fond memories of playing outside, exploring and making mud pies. While there is a play area for children who attend the Nature Preschool and visitors are encouraged to explore along the Center\u2019s 19 miles of trails, the staff wanted a play area that was more open to the public and is relatively clear of natural dangers.\n\nThe CNC team searched for a location that was close to the visitor center, easy to access, relatively free of poison ivy and where they would not be destroying a sensitive ecosystem. Eventually they settled on a section of pine forest that fits all the criteria.\n\n\u201cThe idea behind this whole thing is just free play,\u201d Kirts told the Midland Daily News . \u201cUse the space how you want to use it. Play in the woods, get comfortable with the natural materials.\u201d\n\nCompared to most contemporary playgrounds, The Woods doesn\u2019t contain play sets made of steel or smooth, relatively dry terrain. A cedar split rail fence borders the 1/3 acre lot and encompasses several features for young explorers.\n\nOne of the first stations is a water pump, sourced by a reservoir that\u2019s filled a couple times a day. The small hill was once covered in sandy soil; now the exposed rock is littered with buckets, pails and sticks.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very messy play area, but that\u2019s what kids need: loose parts to create and play. It\u2019s so fascinating to see what they come up with.\u201d\n\nFrom the pump, kids can take the water to the mud kitchen, which was built by a staff member\u2019s dad. The kitchen is outfitted with cooking stations, shelves that can be used as cupboards or ovens, sinks and windows. Kirts has seen younger kids try their hand at mud pies while teenagers have cooking competitions.\n\n\u201cWe see 2- and 3-year-olds and 5-year-olds and 12-year-olds all playing at the same time which is really neat because kids don\u2019t necessarily get that multi-age play.\u201d\n\nA smaller structure is the corral, an enclosed space with benches and cubbyholes stocked with pinecones and corncobs. The intentional sparseness of the area allows kids to exercise their imaginations.\n\n\u201cThis has been a food truck, a restaurant, a daycare, a school,\u201d Kirts observed.\n\nNot everything in The Woods is built on a small scale. In the center of the area is the outline of a cabin. Older kids have constructed walls of sticks and, like the corral, made the space their own. The CNC staff will come into The Woods once in a while to pick up the scattered containers or add more corncobs, but the area is in a constant state of change.\n\n\u201cWe came in one time and all the tables were dragged over to the corral,\u201d Kirts reported. \u201cOne was tipped over and blocking the doorway. Clearly there had been something happening there. They had a plan.\u201d\n\nA sound garden built by a local Boy Scout and a stage offer more theatrical components to the play area. A vernal pool, stump circle and natural tree fort provide avenues for children to engage with nature and build their awareness of their surroundings; sticks might fall in the fort, stumps and rocks may be slippery when wet, changing seasons pose a variety of difficulties. But developing a sense of mindfulness is healthy, Kirts said.\n\n\u201cThere are risks here because you are playing in nature ... This has challenge naturally built in.\u201d\n\nTo help parents and children appreciate the risks and make the best of the space, staff will have signs posted along the fence with suggestions on how to \u201cprotect nature,\u201d \u2033be adventurous and aware,\u201d \u2033respect each other\u201d and take \u201chealthy risks.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really designed to be a space to play in the woods,\u201d Kirts said.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Midland Daily News, http://www.ourmidland.com", "In a Nov. 1, 2016 photo, Beloit Memorial High School student Mauricio Ramos and teacher Beth Cox pet Mary, a comfort dog.

They lose themselves in the experience,\u201d Cox told the Beloit Daily News .\n\nStudent Nayeli Sanchez said the dog is calm, listens and is sweet.

Cox said her students who hesitated to read in September have become more confident and are reading aloud more often in class.\n\nBecause Mary\u2019s visits are going so well, other teachers are inquiring if Mary can make a stop to their rooms as well. Mary also goes out into the hallway during passing time where students can mingle with her.\n\n\u201cStudents stop and ask if they can pet her. She has a vest that says \u2018please pet me,\u2019\u201d Cox said.\n\nCox said she sees a lot of potential for dogs like Mary. In addition to assisting reading students, Cox said the Mary could provide comfort to students with test anxiety or those with personal struggles.\n\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t judge or critique you. She just loves you for being there and who you are,\u201d Cox said.\n\nMary has nine handlers and five people devoted to fundraising and publicity, according to Cheryl Skelly, one of the handlers who also leads Mary\u2019s scheduling and public relations.\n\nMary was acquired by the church on March 1, after undergoing almost two years of training by Lutheran Church Charities. Her handlers take her around to nursing homes, hospitals, schools, places with veterans and wherever they find a need for comfort in Rock County. Mary is beginning to visit inmates at the Rock County Jail and between shifts with the 911 Communications Center employees.\n\nSkelly said golden retrievers are trainable, mild mannered and even-tempered.\n\n\u201cThey love people and people tend to be drawn to them like magnet,\u201d Skelly said. \u201cWhen a person can\u2019t do something for someone who is struggling or suffering, a dog can reach in a way another person can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nSkelly said there is a waiting list of 24 churches waiting for a comfort dog.\n\nDespite her busy schedule, Mary has availability for more visits around the community.\n\nSkelly said Mary shows people they are loved.\n\n\u201cWe do this through the four-pawed creature called Mary, and she\u2019s irresistible,\u201d Skelly said.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Beloit Daily News, http://www.beloitdailynews.com", "In this Oct. 31, 2018 photo, looking west, the 100 block of West Main Street in Watertown, Wis., is seen in an overview.

She used her mid-morning break for a quick dash to Watertown\u2019s downtown to grab a bag of four HB sandwiches: hash browns, scrambled eggs, cheese, bacon and onions all crammed between the buns of a hard roll.\n\nAt the Chalet, the sandwich is a filling staple. And Groves and her co-workers at the Ira L. Henry Co. wanted to make sure their daily routine of making specialty boxes included, for one last time, the HB.\n\nBreakfast at the small diner also included hugs, a few tears and lots of memories. After more than 70 years, the business, located just a few yards from the Rock River and a go-to spot for morning fuel and bar-time cravings, has closed to make way for a town square and maybe a hotel or mixed-used project that could include condominiums and retail.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very sad,\u201d Groves, 39, told the Wisconsin State Journal of the longtime diner\u2019s demise. \u201cEvery place needs change.

And with it, a mix of emotions that range from frustration and uncertainty to hope and optimism.\n\nThe Watertown Redevelopment Authority is spending an estimated $2.2 million to purchase and provide relocation funds to the businesses so that the block can be cleared to better showcase the river and bring new energy to the historic downtown. At the same time, a developer is being sought to invest $8 million to $12 million into a hotel or mixed-use project adjacent to the square and across the street from the Watertown Public Library that is about to undergo a $10 million expansion of its own.\n\nHowever, no proposals were submitted to the RDA by the deadline. So the RDA extended the deadline to Nov. 30 for developers to make their pitch to the RDA.\n\n\u201cThe economy is just very active and we\u2019re going to have to work a little harder to attract a developer to Watertown,\u201d said Kristen Fish, executive director of the RDA that was formed in 2014.\n\n\u201cWe want to be careful about the development that\u2019s created on that site and we do want to take our time and choose a developer that will bring a high-quality development. This kind of project is not a game for the impatient. This is a transformative redevelopment project.\u201d\n\nThe businesses being displaced have a year to move out from the time they were purchased by the RDA. That means most will be gone by next September and October, although the Watertown Daily Times, which has been on its property since 1916, is scheduled to finalize its $650,000 sale and relocation agreement with the RDA next month, Fish said.\n\nThe newspaper, owned and operated since 1919 by four generations of the Clifford family, is searching for a suitable location and is focusing on downtown. But even though the company no longer prints its paper in the Main Street facility, the company, with 30 employees, still uses 12,000 square feet of its 14,000-square-foot building. Finding the right spot for the business hasn\u2019t been easy and will likely cost the company an additional $200,000, said Kevin Clifford, who was named publisher nearly a year ago.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to find a place to house all those people and be downtown where we want to be. We\u2019re struggling with that. It\u2019s not been an easy process,\u201d said Clifford. \u201cThe stress level has been very high. Change is OK. Just don\u2019t make it hurt.\u201d\n\nClifford, who wore blue jeans and a long sleeve Watertown Goslings T-shirt, made his comments recently while seated on the stage of the Towne Theatre. He was joined by Ed Wolff, owner of the trophy shop, and Lisa and Roger Cutsforth, owners of the Chalet. About 60 people had come to the theater to watch \u201cLittle Pink House,\u201d a movie based on the true story of the use of eminent domain to take private property in Connecticut. Eminent domain was not used for the 100 block of West Main Street, but the business owners came to the theater to talk about their plights and plans and answer questions from the audience, which included other downtown business owners not on the redevelopment block.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking for a building on Main Street that does not exist,\u201d said Wolff, whose current store is at the corner of West Main and South Water streets. \u201cLocation is everything. If we\u2019re not on Main Street, we might as well close the doors.\u201d\n\nThe Cutsforths purchased the Chalet in 2004 on a 10-year land contract. They paid it off just two months after city officials went public with their plan to redevelop the block. The Chalet building dates to 1856 and in the early 1900s was home to an ice cream and confectionery shop before becoming a restaurant.\n\nThe business has been known as the Chalet for 71 years, said Lisa Cutsforth, 53, who worked at the diner while in high school and after. For the past 14 years she opened the front door at 4 a.m., and at 1 a.m. on Saturdays and Sundays to serve the after-bar crowd. Her work also helped put her son, Jesse Koehler, through UW-Madison and law school at the University of California-Berkeley.\n\nThe Cutsforths, who received about $500,000 from the sale and in relocation costs, are looking for another location but so far they have not found the right spot after closing on the sale Oct. 3.\n\n\u201cThere are some people that are really gung-ho on the (redevelopment) project but there\u2019s a lot of people that aren\u2019t,\u201d Lisa Cutsforth said. \u201cIf they actually had a plan, it wouldn\u2019t be so disturbing.\u201d\n\nWatertown is a city of about 24,000 people and is known for its German heritage, parochial schools and its two dams on the Rock River that dissects the city that straddles the Dodge and Jefferson county lines. The downtown, where Zwieg\u2019s Grill is to the east and St. Bernard\u2019s Catholic Church towers over the west end, is still home to a furniture store, shoe store, a book shop, the movie theater and several other retailers. The former Kresge\u2019s building, now home to a pet supply store, is undergoing a major renovation, while at Lyon\u2019s Irish Pub, owner Jim Baade is in the midst of a more than $3 million project to upgrade the building and renovate a former ballroom into a second-floor restaurant.\n\nBut, like many other communities, much of the commerce has migrated to the city\u2019s edges with empty storefronts replaced with restaurants and service businesses.\n\nA more than 30,000-square-foot, three-story building that for decades was home to Fischer\u2019s Department Store is now home to a bike shop but the second and third floors of the building are empty. The building, adjacent to but on the east side of the river, is for sale for $650,000. On the river\u2019s west side , across from the 100 block project, a group of private investors has been buying up property, including an old bowling alley, for more development, although no plans have been submitted to the city.\n\nMayor John David, whose family has operated a paint store in the downtown since 1895, saw development efforts in downtown Wausau about six years ago and is convinced that redevelopment of the 100 block of West Main Street in his city will lead to more development, add housing or much needed hotel rooms and make better use of prime real estate along the river. It also will enhance other private projects in the downtown.\n\n\u201cI thought the downtown needed a shot in the arm,\u201d said David, 71, a past president of the Watertown Area Chamber of Commerce and former vice president of the city\u2019s Main Street program. \u201cThe status quo does not work. It works for a while, but I can\u2019t think of anything that has stayed the status quo for 100 years. It\u2019s been a long process, but I think it\u2019s going to be great when it\u2019s done.\u201d\n\nBack at the Chalet, Sandy Phelps, 68, sat with her husband, Craig, who spent 47 years working at Wis-Pak, one of the largest Pepsi Cola plants in the country. Sandy Phelps lived upstairs from the Chalet until she was 5 years old. Her father, Clarence LeMacher, owned the restaurant from about 1946 to the mid-1970s. Sandy Phelps began clearing tables and doing dishes as a child and, as she got older, began waiting tables.\n\nThe green Hamilton Beach malt machine, which was nearly new when she was in grade school, was still making malts on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cIt makes a great malt. I told Lisa I want that,\u201d Sandy Phelps said, in between bites of hash browns. \u201cI hate to see all of these buildings torn down. There\u2019s a lot of memories here.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Wisconsin State Journal, http://www.madison.com/wsj", "HAMTRAMCK, Mich. (AP) \u2014 Over there by the telephone pole? That was a bar called the Nut House.\n\nToward the back of the big building? That\u2019s where the Wayne State archaeology team found a bullet, and it was exciting for a minute \u2014 but then they remembered oh, yeah, that was the police department.\n\nThe big building was the Hamtramck village hall. It\u2019s been gone since the early \u201980s. The Nut House survived Prohibition \u2014 or really, ignored it \u2014 but it\u2019s gone, too, along with everything else that used to be upright in the short block along Jos. Campau.\n\nWhat\u2019s left is harder to see, but in a truly groundbreaking excavation, a professor and her 15 students have spent the semester digging it out from beneath the gravel. On site every Monday in the city\u2019s first comprehensive archaeology project, Krysta Ryzewski\u2019s class is using hand tools, imagination and analysis to uncover history, mystery and modern connections, The Detroit News reported .\n\nAnd beer bottles.\n\nAs archaeological sites go, it\u2019s not Pompeii. It\u2019s just the short block between Grayling and Alice streets, in the shadow of a railroad viaduct built to keep Roaring \u201920s auto workers from getting pulverized by trains as they sprinted to punch in.\n\nBut Pompeii doesn\u2019t have Polish restaurants left over from the old days, or Bangladeshi restaurants greeting the new. Or an excited grad student from Ann Arbor named Stacy Markel earning academic credit as she trots over to show her teacher a piece of glass.\n\nThe bottle has raised lettering that says \u201cDetroit,\u201d she points out. It might say \u201cbrewery.\u201d And like the bullet casings, it came from beneath the old cop shop.\n\nSignificant? Too soon to say. But it\u2019s interesting \u2014 and everything is a potential clue.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the challenges for us,\u201d said Ryzewski, to take fragments from the ground, match them with what\u2019s known or what\u2019s legend or what\u2019s seen on old maps, \u201cand learn how people built and lived in the city.\u201d\n\nCome Dec. 10, Ryzewski\u2019s Archaeology Field Methods class will present its trove of uncovered objects at the Hamtramck Historical Museum a few blocks north.\n\nLots of pottery, so far. Cattle bones, from when people did their own butchering. Buttons and beads. Marbles, in odd places; were children playing in the police and fire stations, or were the first responders of the 1920s just easily amused?\n\nHalf a dozen neatly cut exploration pits are scattered around the property once anchored by the village hall, proudly christened in 1914 and in hopeless disrepair six decades later. The holes are one meter wide and mostly two meters long, and they\u2019ll ultimately be one meter deep unless the digging is halted by water or concrete.\n\nAlong Jos. Campau, two women in burqas look through the chain link fence as anthropology major Julia DiLaura of Detroit shovels small portions of dark dirt into a tall orange bucket. Graduate student Cory Taylor of West Bloomfield sifts the dirt from the bucket through a wood-framed metal screen, and uncovers another marble.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t got to the historic layer yet,\u201d she said.\n\nWhat\u2019s now Hamtramck was mostly farmland and mostly French well into the 1800s. Next came the Germans. The Dodge Main auto plant opened in 1911, and throngs of Poles arrived to work there or at more than 20 factories that emerged near it. Among them, on a site that will presumably go unexplored, was the Acme White Lead Paint Co.\n\nBy 1930, the city\u2019s two square miles were packed with 5,600 people, more than twice the current population. Change came so rapidly, said historical museum chairman Greg Kowalski, that \u201cthere were no playgrounds for kids.\u201d\n\nKowalski, 67, and Ryzewski, 39, have a mutual friend who teaches Polish at Wayne State. The friend introduced them, and Ryzewski suggested a dig.\n\nRyzewski has been overseeing projects for 15 years, one of them on the Caribbean island of Montserrat where a volcano eruption in 1995 buried the British territory\u2019s capital city in 39 feet of mud and ash.\n\nThat southern part of the island is now off limits. Ryzewski works to the north, exploring the effects of a sudden population shift.\n\nIn Hamtramck, she expected the usual red tape, roadblocks and negotiation. What she got instead was Kowalski asking, \u201cWhen do we start?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want to know how people adjust to new environments,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can show how the immigrants of 100 years ago connect to the immigrants of today.\u201d\n\nAlong with artifacts, Ryzewski and her crew have been collecting stories. A favorite says that at the end of their shifts, Hamtramck police officers would simply poke a hand out the window of their patrol cars and someone from the Nut House would oblige them with a beer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a rumor,\u201d said fire lieutenant Andrew Oleksiak, 33. His dad, Dennis, worked out of the village hall fire station, and \u201cthey used to get kegs delivered to the firehouse.\u201d\n\nBetween calls, Oleksiak and his squad have parked their ladder truck alongside the lot and strolled through the gate. He\u2019s watching Ryzewski watch two students whose excavation has hit a snag.\n\n\u201cYou have a tree root going through there, guys,\u201d she says. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you take a pickax to it?\u201d\n\nAnother pickax is in play a few yards to the west, attacking another root. Markel, 52, the finder of the beer bottle, is digging in the former site of a stable. Or maybe it was an outhouse; the old maps and photos aren\u2019t conclusive.\n\nThere\u2019s a thwack, and then a laugh. The root is intact, but Markel has obliterated her reading glasses.\n\nShe picks up the pieces she can see.

(AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee)\n\nFORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) \u2014 After Republicans, including President Donald Trump, made unsubstantiated accusations of illegal activity, a judge on Monday urged the warring sides in the Florida recount to \u201cramp down the rhetoric,\u201d saying it eroded public confidence in the election for Senate and governor.\n\nThe state\u2019s law enforcement arm and elections monitors have found no evidence of wrongdoing, but lawyers for the Republican party and the GOP candidates joined with Trump in alleging that irregularities, unethical behavior and fraud have taken place since the polls closed last week.\n\n\u201cAn honest vote count is no longer possible\u201d in Florida, Trump declared Monday, without elaborating. He demanded that the election night results \u2014 which showed the Republicans leading based upon incomplete ballot counts \u2014 be used to determine the winner.\n\nTrump went on to allege that \u201cnew ballots showed up out of nowhere, and many ballots are missing or forged,\u201d and that ballots are \u201cmassively infected.\u201d It was unclear what he was referring to.\n\nThe recount is mandated by state law.\n\nMuch of the Republicans\u2019 ire was centered on Democrat-leaning Broward County and its Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes, a Democrat who was appointed in 2003 by then-Republican governor Jeb Bush. She has been re-elected four times. Critics have suggested the slow pace of ballot-counting in Broward is suspicious.\n\nAP's Washington Bureau chief Julie Pace explains why outstanding races in Florida and Georgia have become so significant, that even President Donald Trump has taken to twitter about one of them. (Nov. 12)\n\nBroward elections officials have said this year\u2019s count was encumbered by the unexpectedly high turnout for a midterm election and the unusual length of this year\u2019s ballots, which contained 12 state constitutional amendment proposals, partly as a result of a constitutional revision commission that meets once every 20 years.\n\nBush said Monday on Twitter that Snipes should be removed from office, saying there was \u201cno question\u201d that she \u201cfailed to comply with Florida law on multiple counts, undermining Floridians\u2019 confidence in our electoral process.\u201d\n\nSnipes acknowledged Monday that \u201cthere have been issues that haven\u2019t gone the way we wanted.\u201d She said \u201cyou can call it a mistake or you can call it whatever you want to call it.\u201d\n\nShe declined to comment on Trump\u2019s remarks, except to say that \u201cwe\u2019re in an era where people oftentimes speak without having vetted the information, so I\u2019m not sure where the president gets his information from.\u201d\n\nShe said she had not spoken with Trump.\n\nThe president\u2019s allegations came just hours before Broward Chief Circuit Judge Jack Tuter held an emergency hearing on a request by lawyers for Republican Gov. Rick Scott, whose lead in the Senate race over incumbent Democrat Bill Nelson has narrowed with the counting of provisional and other ballots. They asked for additional sheriff\u2019s deputies to be sent to Snipes\u2019 office to monitor ballots and voting machines.\n\nState law requires a machine recount in races where the margin is less than 0.5 percentage points. In the Senate race, Scott\u2019s lead over Nelson was 0.14 percentage points. In the governor\u2019s contest, unofficial results showed Republican former Rep. Ron DeSantis ahead of Democratic Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum by 0.41 percentage points.\n\nOnce the recount is complete, if the differences in any of the races are 0.25 percentage points or less, a hand recount will be ordered. All 67 counties face a state-ordered deadline of Thursday to finish their recounts.\n\nMeanwhile, the elections supervisor in heavily Republican Bay County said he allowed about 150 people to cast ballots by email, the Miami Herald reported. The county was devastated by a Category 4 hurricane in October, and Scott ordered some special provisions for early voting there. A statement that accompanied the order noted that returning ballots by email was not allowed under state law.\n\nGillum expressed outrage about the emailed ballots.\n\n\u201cThese are the stories that we know. Imagine the one that we don\u2019t,\u201d he said Monday at an African-American church in Boynton Beach. He said the recount need not be rushed because the next governor does not take office until January.\n\nIn their Broward request, Scott\u2019s lawyers alleged that Snipes was engaging in \u201csuspect and unlawful vote counting practices\u201d that violate state law and that she might \u201cdestroy evidence of any errors, accidents or unlawful conduct.\u201d The motion was supported by lawyers representing the state Republican Party and opposed by Snipes\u2019 office, Nelson\u2019s campaign and the state Democratic Party.\n\n\u201cI am urging because of the highly public nature of this case to ramp down the rhetoric,\u201d Tuter said.\n\n\u201cIf someone in this lawsuit or someone in this county has evidence of voter fraud or irregularities at the supervisor\u2019s office, they should report it to their local law enforcement officer,\u201d Tuter said. \u201cIf the lawyers are aware of it, they should swear out an affidavit. But everything the lawyers are saying out there in front of the elections office is being beamed all over the country. We need to be careful of what we say. Words mean things these days.\u201d\n\nAfter Tuter told all sides to meet to discuss a compromise, they agreed to add three deputies to the elections office in Broward.\n\nSnipes\u2019 lawyer, Eugene Pettis, said Snipes\u2019 office already has deputies, security guards and cameras guarding the ballots, and the recount process is conducted in view of four representatives each from the Republicans and Democrats.\n\nAlso on Monday, two voter-rights groups filed suit in federal court in Tallahassee. Common Cause and the League of Women Voters sought to remove Scott from any role in the recount.\n\nBipartisan experts agree that voter fraud is a rare phenomenon across the nation. That didn\u2019t stop protests outside Snipes\u2019 office, where a mostly Republican crowd gathered, holding signs, listening to country music and occasionally chanting \u201clock her up,\u201d referring to Snipes. A massive Trump 2020 flag flew over the parking lot.\n\nOther states were also still counting votes. In Arizona, Democrat Kyrsten Sinema defeated Republican Martha McSally to capture a longtime GOP Senate seat.

Nathan Deal listens in the Governor's ceremonial office at the Capitol on Thursday, Nov. 8, 2018, in Atlanta, Ga. Kemp resigned Thursday as Georgia's secretary of state, a day after his campaign said he's captured enough votes to become governor despite his rival's refusal to concede. (Bob Andres/Atlanta Journal-Constitution via AP)\n\nATLANTA (AP) \u2014 His election still undecided, Republican Brian Kemp is proceeding as a victorious candidate and promising to be a governor for all Georgians. That might not be so easy.\n\nShould his narrow lead hold over Democrat Stacey Abrams and send him to the governor\u2019s mansion, Kemp would face lingering questions about how and why he oversaw his own election as secretary of state. His victory would be fueled by an even starker than usual urban-rural divide, with Abrams drawing most of her votes in metro Atlanta and smaller cities, and Kemp running up massive margins in rural and small-town Georgia, eclipsing 85 percent in some counties.\n\nThen there\u2019s his embrace of President Donald Trump\u2019s coarse rhetoric, from Kemp warning about \u201cillegal votes\u201d to promising to \u201cround up criminal illegals\u201d in his pickup truck.\n\nThat plays into what civil rights leaders and observers from both parties describe as a bitter, race-laden contest that pitted Abrams\u2019 bid to become the nation\u2019s first black woman governor against Kemp\u2019s fierce effort to preserve his overwhelmingly white party\u2019s hold on a diversifying Deep South state.\n\nThe after-effects, they say, won\u2019t easily dissipate.\n\nVolunteers in Georgia made phone calls and walked neighborhoods for a last effort to make sure every vote is counted. The Georgia governor's race has been highlighted with accusations of voter supression, and a dearth of working voting machines. (Nov. 9)\n\n\u201cIn the hypothetical scenario that Brian Kemp becomes governor,\u201d said NAACP activist and former congressional candidate Francys Johnson, \u201cthen he and Donald Trump will have both won because they were able to stoke the deepest darkest fears among their base.\u201d\n\nSome Republicans acknowledge the atmosphere even as they defend Kemp from charges he ran a racially and culturally divisive campaign. \u201cSome of this is beyond Brian Kemp\u2019s control,\u201d said Brian Robinson, a former adviser for outgoing Gov. Nathan Deal and for Kemp\u2019s vanquished GOP primary rival. \u201cBrian Kemp cannot extricate himself from the national political environment that now drives every election down to the county level. You run for coroner, you have to say whether you want to \u2018make America great again.\u2019\u201d\n\nFor his part, Kemp notes \u201ca very polarizing climate that we\u2019ve been in.\u201d But he defends his pledge to \u201cput Georgians first\u201d \u2014 a rhetorical cousin to Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d \u2014 and he rejects any notion that he could take office under a cloud that would make his job harder.\n\n\u201cIt was a tough election,\u201d Kemp said two days after the vote. He pointed to his time as a state senator representing a swing district: \u201cI\u2019m going to serve this whole state and move forward with the plans we have.\u201d\n\nUndeterred, Abrams\u2019 campaign filed a federal lawsuit Sunday asking a judge to delay the vote certification until Wednesday and make officials count certain absentee and provisional ballots that would otherwise be rejected. The campaign said thousands of ballots could be affected.\n\nKemp spokesman Ryan Mahoney said Monday the lawsuit shows Abrams has \u201cmoved from desperation to delusion.\u201d\n\n\u201cStacey Abrams lost,\u201d he said, \u201cand her concession is long overdue.\u201d\n\nGeorgia Secretary of State Robyn Crittenden, who was appointed after Kemp resigned last week, sent a bulletin to county election officials Monday telling them to count absentee ballots even if voters have not included their year of birth on the envelope as long as the signature and other information is sufficient to verify their identity.\n\nCrittenden also noted in the bulletin that the period for verifying eligibility of provisional ballots ended Friday required by Georgia law. The Abrams campaign lawsuit asks that a judge order that deadline extended until Wednesday at 5 p.m.\n\nMeanwhile, two Democratic senators \u2014 Cory Booker of New Jersey and Brian Schatz of Hawaii \u2014 sent a letter asking the Justice Department for \u201ca thorough investigation into the potential voting rights abuses that have been reported before, during, and after the election\u201d in Georgia.\n\nLeading up to the election, Abrams called Kemp \u201can architect of suppression.\u201d Kemp says he\u2019s faithfully enforced state and federal elections laws, though that\u2019s not convinced some voters.\n\nNina Durham, a 50-year-old Powder Springs resident, joined a small a group of protesters last week. She said she didn\u2019t have confidence in the results. Asked whether she could see Kemp as her governor, Durham, who is African-American, replied, \u201cNo. He hasn\u2019t represented me as secretary of state.\u201d\n\nUnofficial returns show Kemp leading by about 60,000 votes out of more than 3.9 million votes cast. That\u2019s enough for a narrow majority, but Abrams says enough uncounted absentee, early and provisional ballots remain to bring Kemp below a majority. That would trigger a Dec. 4 runoff.\n\nThe Associated Press has not called the race. The AP will revisit its decision after Tuesday\u2019s deadline for Georgia\u2019s 159 counties to send certified results to the state.\n\nRobinson, the former Deal adviser, noted razor-thin general elections such as this one are mostly new to Georgia.\n\n\u201cBrian did what he had to do to win,\u201d Robinson said. But, \u201cIn two years, we will be at parity or a slight Democratic advantage. ... His re-election in a purple state already has to be under way\u201d and \u201che has to be seen in minority communities, and not just African-American.\u201d\n\nRobinson noted Deal\u2019s work with black lawmakers \u2014 including Abrams \u2014 on a criminal justice overhaul that is reducing mass incarceration, particularly among young black men. He said Kemp could find ways to relax his opposition to expanding Medicaid insurance, perhaps \u201callowing legislators from both parties to take the lead\u201d on some compromise that could draw more federal money to Georgia\u2019s health care system. Expanding Medicaid is Abrams\u2019 top policy priority.\n\nBen Williams, a Southern Christian Leadership Conference leader in suburban Atlanta\u2019s Cobb County, said Kemp must acknowledge\u2014 if not apologize \u2014 for some elements of the campaign. Williams pointed to a photo of Kemp standing with a supporter later identified as a white supremacist. Kemp\u2019s campaign distanced itself at the time, noting Kemp agreed to snapshots with anyone who asked at his public rallies.\n\nIn the campaign\u2019s closing days, Kemp criticized a racist robocall from an out-of-state white supremacy group. But he took heat for his campaign\u2019s official Twitter account sending out a photo of purported Black Panthers holding Abrams\u2019 campaign signs and calling it proof of her radicalism. There was no proof of the affiliation of those pictured, and they were not with Abrams\u2019 campaign.\n\nWilliams said it adds up to a \u201cblatantly racist\u201d effort, intentional or not.\n\nFor all their skepticism, Williams and Johnson predicted Kemp\u2019s leading critics always would be willing to meet with him.\n\nSaid Johnson: \u201cIn civil rights work, our mantra is this: No permanent friends, no permanent enemies, just permanent issues.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Kate Brumback in Atlanta contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow Barrow on Twitter at https://twitter.com/BillBarrowAP", "FILE - In this July 25, 2016, file photo, Rep.

Schiff has repeatedly criticized the House\u2019s Russia investigation, which his GOP colleagues conducted, saying it was inadequate.\n\nNow Schiff will get his chance to conduct his own targeted investigation into Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign and its ties to Russia. He has said that he wants to look at whether Russians used laundered money for transactions with the Trump Organization. He also wants more information about communications the president\u2019s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., had with his father and others about a June 2016 meeting between Trump campaign officials and a Russian lawyer.\n\n___\n\nELIJAH CUMMINGS\n\nOversight and Government Reform Committee\n\nCummings, 67, will likely head the committee that could make life the toughest for the Trump White House because of its broad investigative powers.\n\nCummings would likely seek Trump\u2019s business tax returns and other company-related financial records. He said he will work to make the president accountable, but will also challenge Republicans to uphold their oversight responsibilities, saying, \u201cI think we as a body can do better.\u201d\n\nThe Maryland Democrat, who represents parts of Baltimore city and most of Howard County, has said he would also like the committee to examine prescription drug prices and whether some states have engaged in voter suppression.\n\n\u201cWe cannot have a country where it becomes normal to do everything in Trump\u2019s power to stop people from voting,\u201d Cummings said Sunday on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d\n\nHe would also seek to bring Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross before the committee to testify about the decision to include a citizenship question in the 2020 census.\n\n___\n\nJERROLD NADLER\n\nJudiciary Committee\n\nNadler, 71, has been in Congress since 1992 and has served on the Judiciary Committee for much of that time. He represents a large swath of Trump\u2019s hometown of New York.\n\nHe is expected to make one of his first priorities as chairman protecting special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation and requesting that Mueller\u2019s materials are preserved in case he is fired. Nadler said Sunday on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d that Matthew Whitaker, whom Trump named acting attorney general last week, \u201cshould recuse himself\u201d from Mueller probe because he \u201cexpressed total hostilities to the investigation\u201d and \u201cif necessary\u201d the Judiciary Committee will \u201csubpoena\u201d him to appear before the committee\n\nThe Judiciary panel would also oversee impeachment proceedings, if Democrats decided to move in that direction. But Nadler has expressed caution about the idea, saying there would have to be \u201coverwhelming evidence\u201d from Mueller and some bipartisan support.\n\nThe panel is also expected to look into family separation at the border and the Trump administration\u2019s management of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n___\n\nMAXINE WATERS\n\nFinancial Services Committee\n\nWaters, 80, is expected to chair a committee with oversight of banks, insurers and investment firms. She has opposed Republican-led efforts to roll back the Dodd-Frank financial reform law and is promising colleagues that she will prioritize protecting consumers from abusive financial practices. The California lawmaker, whose district centers on south Los Angeles County, can also conduct aggressive oversight of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and steps it has taken to reduce enforcement actions against student lenders, pay-day lenders and others.\n\nThe president railed against Waters on the campaign trail this year, frequently mentioning her during his rallies. Waters accuses Republicans of serving as Trump\u2019s \u201caccomplices.\u201d\n\n___\n\nCOLLIN PETERSON\n\nAgriculture Committee\n\nPeterson, 74, is a moderate from a heavily rural congressional district in western Minnesota. He is a strong critic of Trump\u2019s trade policies and could use his platform to highlight how farmers have been harmed by retaliatory tariffs from China and other nations. His top priority now is to get a farm bill passed, if not in the current Congress, then in the next one. Peterson will also have the committee take a close look at the reorganization underway at the Agriculture Department, including the push to move its top independent research office out of Washington.\n\n___\n\nJOHN YARMUTH\n\nBudget Committee\n\nYarmuth, 71, is serving his sixth term from Kentucky, where he represents much of the Louisville area. He\u2019ll put together a budget blueprint that includes Democratic lawmakers\u2019 top priorities. He also has said he will hold hearings on a single-payer health plan modeled on the Democratic push to create \u201cMedicare-for-All.\u201d\n\n___\n\nELIOT ENGEL\n\nForeign Affairs Committee\n\nEngel, 71, who represents parts of the Bronx and New York City\u2019s northern suburbs, has been a consistent critic of the president\u2019s foreign policy. He has told colleagues that one of his top priorities will be to investigate where the Trump administration\u2019s foreign-policy actions are intertwined with the president\u2019s business interests. Protecting the State Department is also a priority for him, including looking into whether career officials have been \u201cpurged\u201d because they were deemed insufficiently loyal to the president.\n\n___\n\nRICHARD NEAL\n\nWays and Means Committee\n\nNeal, 69, who represents western and parts of central Massachusetts, is expected to lead the committee that has oversight of tax and trade issues. He is promising hearings on the $1.5 trillion tax cut Republicans pushed through last year and has said he would consider a middle-income tax cut, but only if rates for the top income earners go up to help pay for it.\n\nThe committee has jurisdiction over trade, and Neal said he expects Trump\u2019s trade deal with Mexico and Canada to come before his committee soon. The panel is also expected to seek Trump\u2019s tax returns from the IRS, likely triggering a court fight.\n\n___\n\nBOBBY SCOTT\n\nEducation and the Workforce Committee\n\nScott, 71, is poised to lead the Democratic oversight of changes that Secretary Betsy DeVos has enacted at the Education Department. The Virginia Democrat, who represents parts of the Tidewater area, has told colleagues that he would continue work to free students from the burden of crippling debt, ensure workers have a safe job environment and conduct rigorous oversight to the administration\u2019s \u201cderegulatory agenda.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFRANK PALLONE\n\nEnergy and Commerce Committee\n\nPallone, 67, hails from north-central New Jersey and was a key player when a Democratic-led Congress passed President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law. Pallone said he\u2019ll focus on putting forward legislation to protect that law and on lowering the cost of prescription drugs. He\u2019ll likely revisit legislation he has sponsored that would, among other things, restore marketing and outreach efforts to get more people enrolled in health insurance coverage and increase subsidies for poor and middle-income Americans.\n\nPallone said he also wants to boost broadband access, renewable energy and access to clean drinking water.\n\n___\n\nPETER DeFAZIO\n\nTransportation and Infrastructure\n\nDeFazio, 71, has hopes of working with the Trump administration on infrastructure legislation to generate jobs and repair roads, bridges and airports. He said he wants to work fast, before the 2020 presidential election process kicks in and makes it harder for anything substantial to get done. The obvious barrier is finding the money, at a time when the national deficit is already exploding. DeFazio, who represents Oregon\u2019s southern coastal counties, has put a tiny uptick in gasoline and diesel taxes on the table, but that\u2019s a tough sell with lawmakers.\n\nThe committee also has jurisdiction over the General Services Administration, the agency that manages real estate for the federal government, including the lease for the Trump Hotel in Washington. Democrats have sought information about the hotel\u2019s profitability and whether Trump is using the office of the presidency for private gain.\n\n___\n\nADAM SMITH\n\nArmed Services Committee\n\nSmith, 53, says his top national security priority for the next Congress is oversight of the president, from \u201cthe politicization of the military, to his mismanagement of disaster response, to the lack of a consistent policy concerning civilian casualties, to his policies on Russia, and more.\u201d He said the panel needs to conduct aggressive oversight of the Pentagon\u2019s budget and weapons programs to ensure taxpayers are getting the best value. The Democrat from Washington state, who represents the central Puget Sound area, also said it\u2019s also important to safeguard \u201can inclusive military\u201d by eliminating discriminatory barriers.\n\n___\n\nBENNIE THOMPSON\n\nHomeland Security Committee\n\nThompson, 70, of Mississippi, will lead aggressive oversight of actions that the administration has taken on immigration, including its \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy of prosecuting all adults caught crossing the border illegally and putting their children under the care of the Department of Health and Human Services. The committee will also examine the administration\u2019s response to Hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico, incidents of domestic terrorism by U.S. citizens and what can be done to ensure election security. He represents the western and central parts of Mississippi.\n\n___\n\nRAUL GRIJALVA\n\nNatural Resources Committee\n\nGrijalva, 70, will likely lead a committee that has oversight over national parks and other public lands. The Arizona Democrat has pushed back against the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to expand mining and drilling on federal lands. He\u2019ll conduct oversight into the environmental toll of the administration\u2019s actions. He\u2019ll also emphasize stronger consultation with federal tribes before energy projects are approved. Tribes have complained that the Trump administration moved forward with the Keystone XL pipeline without adequate consultation and analysis of the potential impact on tribal lands. Grijalva\u2019s southwest Arizona district includes parts of Tucson.\n\n___\n\nMARK TAKANO\n\nVeterans Affairs\n\nTakano, 57, who represents the Riverside, California, area, is the favorite to serve as chairman of the committee after being endorsed by Rep. Tim Walz, who won election to serve as governor of Minnesota. The committee will have oversight of efforts to expand access to private health care providers. He says he would work to hold for-profit colleges accountable when they mislead student veterans and that he would continue work to advocate for deported veterans to ensure they get their citizenship and can access their benefits.\n\n___\n\nJIM McGOVERN\n\nRules Committee\n\nMcGovern, 58, will likely lead a panel that determines what bills are debated on the floor and what amendments are allowed to be voted on. McGovern has been critical of Republicans for blocking votes on amendments with broad public support, but it\u2019s unclear how far Democrats will go in reversing those practices. Pelosi has tasked McGovern, who represents central Massachusetts, with coming up with a package of rules governing the chamber, and it\u2019s expected to include a ban on House members sitting on corporate boards.\n\nRep. Julia Brownley of California, 66, is vying to serve as chairwoman. She tells colleagues that she would focus on ensuring the VA has the necessary resources to get veterans care from local health care providers without cannibalizing other VA programs. She would also seek to ensure that the administration takes steps to fill senior leadership vacancies and an estimated 46,000 vacant positions within the VA.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this report.", "", "", "Colorado Avalanche goalie Semyon Varlamov (1) makes the save on Edmonton Oilers' Ty Rattie (8) during second period NHL hockey action in Edmonton, Alberta on Sunday Nov. 11, 2018.

We didn\u2019t get any goals in that game, but today we were rewarded,\u201d Soderberg said. \u201cI think right now, we have been on a losing streak, and we had to do everything better. You need to do that when you\u2019re on a losing streak to get the win.\n\nTy Rattie scored in Edmonton\u2019s fourth straight loss.

The next game is really important.\n\n\u201cThis is not like last year\u2019s team. We still have a strong belief system in here. I don\u2019t even want to compare it to last year.\u201d\n\nRantanen got the Avalanche started just 26 seconds into the game, converting the rebound of Nathan MacKinon\u2019s shot past Talbot for his sixth of the season.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s big, you get one in the first shift and you feel good about yourself,\u201d Mackinnon said. \u201cThose are always good when you get one early.\u201d\n\nSoderberg scored on a long point shot through traffic to give make it 2-0 with 4:27 remaining in the opening period.\n\nThe Avs added to their lead with a power-play goal five minutes into the second period when Kerfoot was allowed three whacks at the puck from the side of the net before scoring. That brought Koskinen in to replace Talbot.\n\nColorado kept coming with another goal midway through the second period, as Rantanen fed it in front for Barrie, who scored his first goal of the season. Rantanen regained the lead in the NHL scoring race on the play with his 26th point.\n\nIt was also Barrie\u2019s 62nd career goal, tying him with Rob Blake for third among defensemen in Avalanche franchise history.\n\n\u201cThat one is cool because Blake was my favorite defenseman growing up,\u201d Barrie said. \u201cI wore No. 4 growing up because of him, and I ended up playing for Colorado.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Facing closely contested election races in Florida and Arizona, President Donald Trump is spreading misleading rhetoric regarding voting fraud.\n\nHe says votes are suspiciously appearing \u201cout of the wilderness\u201d in Arizona after Election Day to boost the Democratic candidate in the Senate race. It\u2019s actually typical for the state to take additional days after an election to finish tabulating mail-in votes.\n\nTrump also suggests that heavily Democratic counties in Florida may be improperly seeking to inflate the Democratic vote in the state\u2019s Senate and governor races. There\u2019s no evidence of that. The Florida state agencies charged with investigating potential fraud say no credible allegations exist.\n\nMeanwhile, on the economy, Trump asserted that U.S. growth under his watch has been unprecedented. In fact, it was surpassed just four years ago during the Obama administration. He also minimized the trade threat from China and claims a U.S. steel industry renaissance that isn\u2019t really happening.\n\nA look at his claims, also covering health care and veterans:\n\nFLORIDA ELECTIONS\n\nTRUMP: \u201cYou mean they are just now finding votes in Florida and Georgia \u2014 but the Election was on Tuesday? Let\u2019s blame the Russians and demand an immediate apology from President Putin!\u201d \u2014 tweet Friday.\n\nTRUMP: \u201cTrying to STEAL two big elections in Florida! We are watching closely!\u201d \u2014 tweet Saturday.\n\nTHE FACTS: He\u2019s making baseless charges of \u201cstealing\u201d elections in Florida\u2019s Senate and governor races, which headed for recounts due to razor-thin leads held by Republicans Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis, respectively.\n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for vote tallies to change in the days after the election as local officials process mailed and provisional ballots. In Florida, both Scott and DeSantis saw their leads dwindle in recent days as the Democratic strongholds of Palm Beach and Broward counties continued to count votes. That vote count concluded Saturday, leading to the Florida secretary of state\u2019s order for recounts after the unofficial results in both races fell within the margin that by law triggers a review.\n\nIn the past two elections, in 2016 and 2014, Florida counted more than 99 percent of the vote on Election Day and in the early hours of the next day. In Broward, election officials updated vote totals for days after Election Day.\n\nIn alleging potential fraud, Scott, as outgoing governor, had said Thursday night that he was asking the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to investigate elections offices in Palm Beach and Broward. However, the agency said Friday there were no credible allegations of fraud and therefore, no investigation is active.\n\nScott\u2019s campaign also filed a lawsuit asking that the Broward County supervisor of elections be ordered to turn over several records detailing the counting and collection of ballots cast. A judge Friday sided with Scott and ordered Broward\u2019s election supervisor to release that voter information; the ruling did not address allegations of fraud.\n\nThe state\u2019s election division, which Scott runs, said Saturday that its observers in Broward had seen \u201cno evidence of criminal activity.\u201d\n\nVoting fraud in Florida and nationwide, in fact, is extremely rare. Trump often asserts that voter fraud is a significant issue, but has not provided evidence of consequential fraud.\n\nAfter the 2016 election, Trump convened a commission to investigate potential voting fraud, after alleging repeatedly and without evidence that fraud cost him the popular vote. Trump won the Electoral College. But he disbanded the panel in January, blaming the decision on more than a dozen states that refused to comply with the commission\u2019s demand for reams of personal voter data.\n\n___\n\nARIZONA SENATE RACE\n\nTRUMP: \u201cNow in Arizona, all of a sudden, out of the wilderness, they find a lot of votes, and she\u2019s \u2014 the other candidate is just winning by a hair.\u201d \u2014 remarks to reporters Friday.\n\nTRUMP: \u201cJust out \u2014 in Arizona, SIGNATURES DON\u2019T MATCH. Electoral corruption - Call for a new Election? We must protect our Democracy!\u201d \u2014 tweet Friday.\n\nTHE FACTS: There is no evidence of anything unusual going on in the vote-counting in Arizona. Trump made the charges of \u201celectoral corruption\u201d and votes appearing \u201cout of the wilderness\u201d as Republican pessimism grew about Rep. Martha McSally\u2019s prospects in the Senate race. However, Arizona normally takes more than a week to count its ballots, and no elected Republican officials in the state have cried foul. It\u2019s possible that Democrat Kyrsten Sinema\u2019s opponent, McSally, could jump back into the lead in the coming days. That wouldn\u2019t be suspicious, either.\n\nThe vote count tends to take longer in Arizona because residents like to vote early, by mail, and a mailed-in ballot requires more work for elections officials.\n\nState law requires the envelope to be sealed and signed, and for elections officials to match each signature to the one on file with the voter\u2019s registration before even opening the envelope. In this election, that\u2019s about 1.7 million individual signatures that had to be confirmed, one by one. A total of about 2.4 million votes were cast in Arizona.\n\nThe work piles up in the final days before the election as ballots flood in. Voters can also drop off sealed mail ballots on Election Day, adding to the pile. The state\u2019s Republican secretary of state, Michele Reagan, added another reason: election security. To ensure against voter fraud, mail ballots dropped off Election Day \u2014 which totaled 320,000 \u2014 are double-checked with votes cast at the polls to confirm no one voted twice.\n\nThe GOP had filed a lawsuit seeking to stop Maricopa and Pima counties from contacting voters after Election Day about problems with the signatures on their mail ballots. But they, Democrats and the state\u2019s counties settled the complaint Friday to essentially allow the rest of the state to follow the more lenient Maricopa and Pima standards. Those standards are what Trump seemed to complain about in his \u201csignatures don\u2019t match\u201d tweet.\n\n___\n\nMIDTERM ELECTIONS\n\nTRUMP, on the message taken from Tuesday\u2019s elections: \u201cI think the results that I\u2019ve learned, and maybe confirm, I think people like me. I think people like the job I\u2019m doing, frankly. Because if you look at every place I went to do a rally ... and it was very hard to do it with people in Congress because there are just too many ... but I did it with the Senate. I did it with (Kentucky Rep.) Andy Barr, as you know. And he won.\u201d \u2014 news conference Wednesday.\n\nTHE FACTS: Trump is wrong to suggest that congressional candidates won in every state where he held a rally on their behalf.\n\nTwo Republicans who closely embraced Trump in their Senate races \u2014 Montana\u2019s state auditor, Matt Rosendale, and West Virginia\u2019s attorney general, Patrick Morrisey \u2014 lost to Democratic Sens. Jon Tester and Joe Manchin, respectively. Trump had visited Montana four times and West Virginia three times to rally voters. Also losing Tuesday were Republican Sen. Dean Heller of Nevada, defeated by Democratic Rep. Jacky Rosen, and Leah Vukmir, a GOP state lawmaker in Wisconsin who lost her Senate race to Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin. Trump campaigned for Heller in Nevada on Oct. 20 and for Vukmir in Wisconsin on Oct. 24.\n\nIn the House, Republican Rep. Jason Lewis lost his race in Minnesota to Democrat Angie Craig, whom he had defeated by 2 percentage points in 2016. Trump campaigned in Minnesota on Oct. 4 after Lewis invited Trump to appear for him.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP: \u201cFifty-five is the largest number of Republican senators in the last 100 years.\u201d \u2014 news conference Wednesday.\n\nTHE FACTS: His party didn\u2019t win 55 Senate seats Tuesday. Republicans held 55 seats in the Senate in 2005-2006, as well as 1997-2000, according to the Senate historian\u2019s office.\n\nAfter Tuesday\u2019s elections, Republicans will hold a 51-46 edge, with races in Florida and Arizona too close to call. A special election in Mississippi has advanced to a runoff election on Nov. 27 between Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith and Democrat Mike Espy. That means 54 Republican seats if those three races all break the GOP\u2019s way.\n\n___\n\nECONOMY\n\nTRUMP: \u201cAmerica is booming like never before. ... In terms of GDP, we\u2019re doing unbelievably.\u201d \u2014 news conference Wednesday.\n\nTRUMP, on his telephone conversation Tuesday night with House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi: \u201cWe didn\u2019t talk about impeaching. We didn\u2019t talk about \u2014 what do you do? Do you impeach somebody because he created the greatest economic success in the history of our country?\u201d\n\nTHE FACTS: The economy is healthy, but it\u2019s not unbelievable or unprecedented. It\u2019s also not clear what he means in claiming the nation\u2019s \u201cgreatest economic success\u201d ever.\n\nThe economy expanded at a 4.2 percent annual rate in the April-June quarter, then by 3.5 percent in the July-September quarter. Those are the best two quarters in just four years. Growth reached 5.1 percent in the second quarter of 2014, followed by 4.9 percent in the third quarter.\n\nThe economy has boomed much more dramatically in the past. In the late 1990s, growth topped 4 percent for four straight years. It reached 7.2 percent in 1984. The unemployment rate is now at an impressive 50-year low of 3.7 percent. But it remained below 4 percent for nearly four years in the late 1960s.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP: \u201cAnd our steel industry is back. Our aluminum industry is starting to do really well. These are industries that were dead. Our miners are working again.\u201d \u2014 news conference Wednesday.\n\nTHE FACTS: He\u2019s exaggerating.\n\nThe steel industry has added jobs at a faster rate than the economy as a whole since Trump\u2019s inauguration, though all the gains occurred before the administration imposed tariffs on steel imports in March. Still, the rebound has hardly restored steel to its former glory.\n\nThe United States has added 5,500 steel jobs since Trump entered the White House for a total of 86,500. Before the Great Recession, there were about 100,000 steel jobs. Aluminum factories have added 2,600 jobs since the inauguration for a total of 60,100. These are minor changes in an economy with almost 150 million jobs.\n\nMeanwhile, not many miners are working again. Coal mining jobs have increased just 1,900 to 52,600 since Trump\u2019s inauguration. That\u2019s also a lot lower than the roughly 70,000 coal mining jobs that existed as recently as 2014.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP: \u201cChina got rid of their \u2018China \u201925\u2019 because I found it very insulting. I said that to them. I said, \u2018China \u201825\u2019 is very insulting, because \u2018China \u201825\u2019 means, in 2025, they\u2019re going to take over, economically, the world. I said, \u2018That\u2019s not happening.\u2019\u201d \u2014 news conference Wednesday.\n\nTHE FACTS: There\u2019s no evidence China has abandoned its economic plan. Trump is referring to China\u2019s \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d plan, under which that country\u2019s government aims to develop world-leading companies in robotics, semiconductors, electric vehicles and other advanced technologies. It\u2019s a sore point between the two nations because the United States and other countries argue that China is using unfair tactics to achieve those aims, such as forcing U.S. companies to share technology and providing government subsidies.\n\nChinese officials have played down the plan in recent months because of the international criticism. But there\u2019s little sign they have \u201cgotten rid of\u201d the plan. Because China sees the plan as a key step in the development of its economy, many observers worry they are unlikely to scale it back, which suggests U.S.-China trade fights aren\u2019t going away anytime soon.\n\n___\n\nVETERANS\n\nTRUMP: \u201cI\u2019ve done more for the vets than any President has done, certainly in many, many decades, with Choice and with other things, as you know. ...If you look at Choice \u2014 Choice alone \u2014 I mean, just take a look at what we\u2019ve done with Choice.\u201d \u2014 news conference Wednesday.\n\nTHE FACTS: He\u2019s taking premature credit for improvements that will take years to see full effect in regards to the Veterans Choice program.\n\nTrump signed legislation in June to expand the private-sector Choice program, which was first approved in 2014 during the Obama administration in the wake of a scandal at the Phoenix VA medical center in which some veterans died while waiting months for appointments. The current Choice program allows veterans to see doctors outside the VA system if they must wait more than 30 days for an appointment or drive more than 40 miles to a VA facility.\n\nHow much Choice will be expanded, however, will depend on yet-to-be-completed regulations that will determine eligibility for veterans as well as available money for the program. The Department of Veterans Affairs has yet to resolve long-term financing due to congressional budget caps that could put funding for VA or other domestic programs at risk of shortfalls next year.\n\nAlso important to the program\u2019s success is an overhaul of the VA\u2019s electronic medical records to allow seamless sharing of medical records with private physicians, a process expected to take up to 10 years.

The availability of Trump\u2019s short-term health plans also is not going to \u201cdrive down\u201d prices of the Obama-era overhaul or comprehensive plans, but may increase premiums for robust coverage if fewer healthy people take it as a result.\n\nStrictly speaking, the short-term and association health plans are not new. The Trump administration has broadened their potential reach, although some states may push back with restrictions.\n\nShort-term plans don\u2019t have to take people with medical conditions or provide benefits such as coverage for maternity, mental health, prescription drugs and substance abuse treatment. Association health plans do have to accept people with pre-existing medical conditions, but they don\u2019t have to cover the full menu of 10 \u201cessential\u201d kinds of benefits required by Obamacare.\n\nGary Claxton of the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation says short-term plans may turn out to be more costly than Trump administration officials suggest. The plans now cover up to 90 days, but if insurers expand them to offer up to 36 months\u2019 coverage, the companies will be taking on more risk.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to pay more up front because there\u2019s a longer time during which you could get sick,\u201d Claxton said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Nicholas Riccardi, Calvin Woodward, Alan Fram and Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFind AP Fact Checks at http://apne.ws/2kbx8bd\n\nFollow @APFactCheck on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APFactCheck", "SEATTLE (AP) \u2014 Myles Carter had 25 points and 12 rebounds and Morgan Means scored 21 points to help Seattle beat Bryant 82-59 on Sunday night.\n\nCarter, a 6-foot-9 junior who redshirted last season after transferring from Seton Hall, was 10-of-17 shooting and blocked three shots.

(Barrington Coombs/PA via AP)\n\nIt was one of the more under-the-radar purchases of the offseason, coming late on a Friday when soccer fans around the globe were eagerly anticipating the World Cup final between France and Croatia two days later.\n\nLiverpool was signing a back-up midfielder for 13 million pounds (then $17.2 million), and it went largely unnoticed at the time.\n\nXherdan Shaqiri\u2019s cut-price arrival at Anfield from relegated Stoke in July could, however, prove to be a masterstroke \u2014 an astute piece of business that might yet be a key factor in Liverpool\u2019s bid to capture a first English league title since 1990.\n\nIn Shaqiri, Liverpool now has the creative attacking midfielder it has been lacking since selling Philippe Coutinho to Barcelona for 160 million euros (then $192 million) in January. Coutinho is at another level to Shaqiri, as their respective price tags suggest, but that won\u2019t concern Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp.\n\nKlopp\u2019s selective use of the Switzerland international has been telling in the early part of this season, which Liverpool has started better than any previous Premier League campaign.\n\nThe German coach has stuck with a hard-working midfield three for Liverpool\u2019s tougher games, a nod to the 4-3-3 system the team deployed in the second half of last season during its march to the Champions League final.\n\nShaqiri has begun on the bench in those games, and instead been utilized more from the start in matches where Liverpool comes up against packed opposition defenses and needs more vision from deep.\n\nIn the past three weeks \u2014 amid a benign run of fixtures for Klopp\u2019s side \u2014 Shaqiri has set up the winner for Mohamed Salah at Huddersfield with a slide-rule pass behind the defense, scored a well-taken and importantly timed goal at home to Cardiff, and then netted Liverpool\u2019s second goal in the 2-0 win over Fulham on Sunday.\n\nThey may appear minor contributions but shouldn\u2019t be underestimated. Liverpool struggled against the league\u2019s bottom three teams last season, losing at Swansea, drawing twice against West Bromwich Albion and also dropping points at home to Stoke.\n\nKlopp\u2019s devastating front three of Salah, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane excelled against the so-called bigger teams, who came out to play more against Liverpool and left more space behind their defense. It was in the games Liverpool was expected to win that Klopp\u2019s team often proved to be a let-down.\n\nThat\u2019s not the case this season, not with Shaqiri complementing the pace, movement and energy of the forward line.\n\nShaqiri will have to live with not playing every game. He might not even get off the bench on occasions.\n\nHe might finish the season with a Premier League winner\u2019s medal, though.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nSteve Douglas is at www.twitter.com/sdouglas80", "JERSEY CITY, N.J.

Jim Justice\u2019s office said late Saturday he received a letter from Justice Allen Loughry and accepted his resignation effective at the close of business Monday. Justice had no further comment and Loughry\u2019s one-sentence resignation letter didn\u2019t elaborate.\n\nLoughry was convicted last month of federal criminal charges including wire fraud involving his personal use of state cars and fuel cards and mail fraud. He has requested a new trial.\n\nLast week Justice had called the special session for Tuesday, saying in a proclamation that it would consider removing Loughry from his post. Another proclamation Sunday canceled the special session in light of Loughry\u2019s resignation.\n\nLoughry couldn\u2019t be reached for comment. His attorney, John A. Carr, said in an email he would have no comment.\n\nLoughry and three other justices were impeached by the West Virginia House in August over questions involving lavish office renovations that evolved into varying accusations of corruption, incompetence and neglect of duty. One of them, Justice Beth Walker, was cleared of an impeachment charge at a Senate trial last month.\n\nThe West Virginia Supreme Court last month effectively halted the Legislature\u2019s remaining efforts to impeach the state\u2019s justices as a violation of the separate of power doctrine. The court ruled that the Senate lacks jurisdiction to pursue its impeachment trial of Justice Margaret Workman.\n\nThe Senate had postponed Workman\u2019s trial after the presiding judge didn\u2019t show up following the court ruling. A panel of acting justices said the court\u2019s decision to stop Workman\u2019s impeachment hearing also applies to retired Justice Robin Davis and Loughry, who had petitioned the court to intervene.\n\nSenate President Mitch Carmichael, a Republican, lauded the resignation announcement Saturday.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate that Justice Loughry has decided to do the right thing and step down from the Court,\u201d Carmichael said in a statement.\n\nJudicial elections in West Virginia became nonpartisan in 2016, but the court\u2019s impeachment scandal this year stirred political attacks. Some Democrats argued that the court\u2019s shakeup over spending and other issues was a power grab by the Republican-led legislature.\n\nOn Election Day, two state Supreme Court justices appointed to the court after the scandal broke won election to continue on the bench: Former House speaker Tim Armstead and ex-Congressman Evan Jenkins won those races Tuesday night, each defeating nine other candidates. They had originally been appointed by Justice to fill two of the seats on the state\u2019s highest court pending the midterm election.\n\nArmstead will complete the term of Justice Menis Ketchum, who announced his resignation on the eve of the House\u2019s impeachment proceedings.

In a talk-radio interview he maintained there was no evidence of collusion between the Russia and the Trump campaign during the 2016 election.\n\nThe letter to the Justice Department asked Lofthus to explain his reasoning for any recommendation he made to Whitaker regarding recusal and to provide all ethics guidance provided to the acting attorney general.\n\nWhitaker, a Republican Party loyalist and chief of staff to just-ousted Attorney General Jeff Sessions, was elevated Wednesday after Trump forced Sessions out.\n\nWhitaker has faced pressure from Democrats to recuse himself from overseeing Mueller based on the comments, which were made before he joined the Justice Department last year.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has said there is no need for it, but other Republicans, like Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake and Maine Sen. Susan Collins, have called for the bill since Whitaker was appointed.\n\nSchumer declined to say whether Democrats would be willing to force a government shutdown if Congress did not pass a measure protecting Mueller suggesting it wouldn\u2019t come to that because of bipartisan support. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason we shouldn\u2019t add this and avoid a constitutional crisis,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s State of the Union. \u201cIf that doesn\u2019t happen, we will see what happens down the road.\u201d\n\nThe bipartisan Mueller legislation was approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee in April and was co-sponsored by Republican Sens.

(AP) \u2014 A video of a white U.S. senator from Mississippi making a flip reference to a \u201cpublic hanging\u201d is incensing voters in a special election runoff, drawing attention to the state\u2019s history of lynching and boosting Democrats\u2019 hope of pulling off a stunner in the Deep South.\n\nRepublican Cindy Hyde-Smith is facing former congressman and former U.S. agriculture secretary Mike Espy, a black Democrat, in a runoff Nov. 27. She was captured on video praising a supporter by declaring, \u201cIf he invited me to a public hanging, I\u2019d be on the front row.\u201d\n\nAfter the video was made public Sunday, Hyde-Smith said her remark Nov. 2 at a campaign event in Tupelo was \u201can exaggerated expression of regard\u201d for a friend who invited her to speak. \u201cAny attempt to turn this into a negative connotation is ridiculous,\u201d she said.\n\nEspy on Monday called the remark \u201cdisappointing and harmful.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt reinforces stereotypes that we\u2019ve been trying to get away from for decades, stereotypes that continue to harm our economy and cost us jobs,\u201d he told MSNBC\u2019s Chris Matthews.\n\nAt a news conference Monday with Republican Gov. Phil Bryant by her side, a stone-faced Hyde-Smith refused to answer questions about the hanging remark.\n\n\u201cI put out a statement yesterday, and that\u2019s all I\u2019m going to say about it,\u201d she said.\n\nRepublicans have been counting on a Hyde-Smith victory over Espy as they try to expand their Senate majority. Her remark may not slow her down in the deeply conservative state, but it has highlighted a battle between Mississippi\u2019s past and future and put a painful coda to an election season marked by a resurgence of racism in Southern politics.\n\n\u201cIt really rocked folks,\u201d said Democrat Rukia Lumumba, co-director of The Electoral Justice Project and a native Mississippian whose family has deep roots in the state\u2019s politics and civil rights activism. \u201cThe fact that she has yet to apologize, to recognize the impact of her comments or that people have suffered ... I hope it makes us feel the urgency.\u201d\n\nThe words undoubtedly raised the profile of a race that has largely flown under the national radar. Hyde-Smith was appointed to fill the seat vacated by longtime Republican Sen. Thad Cochran when he retired in April, and she ran this fall to hold the seat for the remaining two years of Cochran\u2019s term.\n\nShe and Espy each received about 41 percent of the vote in a four-person race to advance to the runoff. Another Republican won 16 percent.\n\nThe results suggest Espy has an uphill battle, but some in the state see him as a rare Mississippi Democrat who could pull off an upset. Buoyed by Democrat Doug Jones\u2019 victory in the U.S. Senate race in Alabama last year, Democrats have been organizing in Mississippi for months. Black voters in particular have powered the effort, seeing it as a moment for generational change.\n\n\u201cThis race matters because voters are deciding: Are we going to move forward or are we going to move backward?\u201d said LaTosha Brown, co-founder of Black Voters Matter Fund, a voter turnout group that was a key organizer behind Jones\u2019 victory.\n\nAccording to the NAACP, 4,743 lynchings occurred in the United States between 1882 and 1968, and nearly 73 percent of the victims were black. Mississippi had 581 during that time \u2014 more than any other state.\n\nBryant, who appointed Hyde-Smith, defended her Monday, saying, \u201cThere was nothing in her heart of ill will.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll of us in public life have said things on occasion that could have been phrased better,\u201d he said. \u201cShe meant no offense by that statement.\u201d\n\nMississippi has long struggled with race and racism in its politics.\n\nThe state still uses a state flag adopted in 1894 that includes the Confederate battle emblem, though all the state\u2019s public universities and several cities and counties have stopped flying it.\n\nAnother Republican from Mississippi, Trent Lott, lost his position as Senate majority leader in 2002 after saying at the 100th birthday party of South Carolina U.S. Sen. Strom Thurmond that Mississippi had proudly voted for Thurmond when he ran a segregationist campaign for president in 1948.\n\nA Republican member of the Mississippi House, Rep. Karl Oliver, was criticized in May 2017 after he posted on Facebook that people should be lynched for removing Confederate monuments.\n\nEspy in 1986 became the first African-American since Reconstruction to win a U.S. House seat in Mississippi. If he defeats Hyde-Smith, he would be the first African-American since Reconstruction to represent the state in the U.S. Senate.\n\nHyde-Smith, who is endorsed by President Donald Trump, is the first woman to represent Mississippi in either chamber of Congress and is trying to become the first woman elected to the U.S. Senate from the state.\n\nAP VoteCast, a survey of the electorate, showed significant differences in voting behavior by age and race in Mississippi\u2019s special election. Hyde-Smith leaned heavily on the support of white voters, older ones in particular.\n\nOverall, 57 percent of white voters supported Hyde-Smith, 21 percent voted for Espy and 18 percent supported Republican Chris McDaniel, who placed third last week. Black voters overwhelming broke for Espy: 83 percent supported the Democrat, according to AP VoteCast.\n\nOn Monday, local groups held a conference call to discuss their turnout strategy and response to Hyde-Smith\u2019s remarks.

Trump is attending centennial commemorations in Paris this weekend to mark the Armistice that ended World War I. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\n\nPARIS (AP) \u2014 For President Donald Trump in Paris, America First meant largely America alone.\n\nAt a weekend commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I, the president who proudly declares himself a \u201cnationalist\u201d stood apart, even on a continent where his brand of populism is on the rise.\n\nHe began his visit with a tweet slamming the French president\u2019s call for a European defense force, arrived at events alone and spent much of his trip out of sight in the American ambassadors\u2019 residence in central Paris. On Sunday, he listened as he was lectured on the dangers of nationalist isolation, and then he headed home just as the inaugural Paris Peace Summit was getting underway.\n\nBack at the White House on Monday, Trump tweeted that \u201cmuch was accomplished\u201d in his meetings, but voiced a familiar complaint about America\u2019s allies. He said the U.S. pays billions \u201cprotecting other countries, and we get nothing but Trade Deficits and Losses.\u201d He added: \u201cIt is time that these very rich countries either pay the United States for its great military protection, or protect themselves.\u201d\n\nHis France trip made clear that, nearly two years after taking office, Trump has dramatically upended decades of American foreign policy posture, shaking allies. That includes French President Emmanuel Macron, who on Sunday warned that the \u201cancient demons\u201d that caused World War I and millions of deaths were once again making headway.\n\nMacron, who has been urging a re-embrace of multinational organizations and cooperation that have been shunned by Trump, delivered a barely veiled rebuke of Trumpism at the weekend\u2019s centerpiece event: A gathering of dozens of leaders at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at the base of the Arc de Triomphe to mark the passage of a century since the guns fell silent in a global war that killed millions. Bells tolled across Europe\u2019s Western Front and fighter jets passed overhead to mark the exact moment the devastating war came to a close.\n\nWith Trump and other leaders looking on, Macron took on the rising tide of populism in the United States and Europe and urged leaders not to turn their backs by turning inward.\n\n\u201cPatriotism is the exact opposite of nationalism: Nationalism is a betrayal of patriotism,\u201d Macron said, adding that, when nations put their interests first and decide \u201cwho cares about the others\u201d they \u201cerase the most precious thing a nation can have ... its moral values.\u201d\n\nAfter Trump was gone, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who recently announced that she will not be seeking re-election, made an impassioned plea for global cooperation at the peace forum, saying World War I had \u201cmade clear what disastrous consequences a lack of compromise in politics and diplomacy can have.\u201d\n\nTrump, who has made clear that he has limited patience for broad, multilateral agreements, sat mostly stone-faced as he listened to Macron, who sees himself as Europe\u2019s foil to the rising nationalist sentiment, which has taken hold in Hungary and Poland among other countries.\n\nTrump did engage with his fellow leaders, attending a group welcome dinner hosted by Macron at the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay on Saturday night and a lunch on Sunday. He also spent time with Macron on Saturday, when the two stressed their shared desire for more burden-sharing during a quick availability with reporters.\n\nBut Trump was terse during some of his private conversations with world leaders, according to people with direct knowledge of his visit. One of the people described the president as \u201cgrumpy.\u201d They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss private conversations.\n\nThe symbolism during Trump\u2019s visit couldn\u2019t have been more stark.\n\nTrump was missing from one of the weekend\u2019s most powerful images: A line of world leaders, walking shoulder to-shoulder in a somber, rain-soaked procession as the bells marking the exact moment that fighting ended \u2014 11 a.m. on Nov. 11, 1918 \u2014 finished tolling.\n\nThe president and first lady Melania Trump had traveled to the commemoration separately \u2014 White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders cited security protocols \u2014 from the other dignitaries, who had traveled together by bus from the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace.\n\nAs Trump\u2019s motorcade was making its solo trip down the grand Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, which was closed to traffic, at least one topless woman breached tight security, running into the street and shouting \u201cfake peace maker\u201d as the cars passed. She had slogans, including the words \u201cFake\u201d and \u201cPeace,\u201d written on her chest.\n\nPolice tackled the woman and the motorcade continued uninterrupted. The feminist activist group Femen later claimed responsibility.\n\nAlso traveling on his own was Russian President Vladimir Putin, who shook Trump\u2019s hand, flashed him a thumbs-up sign and patted Trump\u2019s arm as he arrived. Trump responded with a wide smile.\n\nNational security adviser John Bolton had said at one point that Putin and Trump would meet in Paris, but they will instead hold a formal sit-down later this month at a world leaders\u2019 summit in Buenos Aires. A Kremlin official said later that U.S. and Russian officials decided to drop plans for the Paris meeting after French officials objected.\n\nTrump, who ran on an \u201cAmerica First\u201d platform, has jarred European allies with his actions. He has slapped tariffs on the European Union, pulled the U.S. out of the landmark Paris Climate Accord and the Iran nuclear deal and suggested he might be willing to pull the U.S. out of NATO if member counties don\u2019t significantly boost their defense spending. Trump\u2019s eagerness to get along with the Russian leader \u2014 in spite of Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 election and numerous other aggressive moves in recent years \u2014 has alarmed those who view Russia as a growing threat.\n\nTrump has also repeatedly branded himself a \u201cnationalist,\u201d despite criticism from some that the term has negative connotations. At a news conference last week, Trump defended his use of the phrase. \u201cYou know what the word is? I love our country,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cYou have nationalists. You have globalists. I also love the world and I don\u2019t mind helping the world, but we have to straighten out our country first. We have a lot of problems.\u201d\n\nBut Trump did not broach the divide as he paid tribute Sunday to U.S. and allied soldiers killed in World War I during \u201ca horrible, horrible war\u201d that marked America\u2019s emergence as a world power.\n\n\u201cWe are gathered together at this hallowed resting place to pay tribute to the brave Americans who gave their last breath in that mighty struggle,\u201d Trump said at the Suresnes American Cemetery and Memorial in the suburbs of Paris, where more than 1,500 Americans who died in the war are buried.\n\n\u201cIt is our duty to preserve the civilization they defended and to protect the peace they so nobly gave their lives to secure one century ago,\u201d he said after spending a moment, standing alone amid the cemetery\u2019s white crosses, holding a black umbrella.\n\nThe Veterans Day speech came a day after Trump was criticized for failing to visit a different American cemetery about 60 miles (100 kilometers) outside of Paris on Saturday because rain grounded the helicopter he had planned to take. A handful of senior administration officials, including White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, went in the president\u2019s place, while Trump remained behind at the ambassador\u2019s residence with no alternate schedule for hours.\n\nTrump delivered the speech as other leaders were gathered for the Paris Peace Forum, which aims to revive collective governance and international cooperation to tackle global challenges. Afterward he flew back to Washington.\n\nFrance was the epicenter of World War I, the first global conflict. Its role as host of the main international commemoration highlighted the point that the world mustn\u2019t stumble into war again, as it did so quickly and catastrophically with World War II.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Robert Burns and Julie Pace in Washington and Lori Hinnant and Angela Charlton in Paris contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFor more information on World War I, go to The Associated Press\u2019 WWI hub: https://www.apnews.com/WorldWarI\n\n___\n\nFollow Superville and Colvin on Twitter at https://twitter.com/dsupervilleap and https://twitter.com/colvinj", "MONTPELIER, Vt.

(AP Photo/Steve Cannon)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 For much of the country, the 2018 midterm season is over. But unresolved races for governor in Georgia and Florida are raising major strategic questions for Democrats as they turn their attention to the upcoming battle for the White House.\n\nAs in other states, Democrats in Florida and Georgia drew record turnout in last week\u2019s election. The coalition of suburban women, young people and minorities delivered the House to Democrats for the first time in nearly a decade.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t enough to score decisive victories in the closely watched races for governor in Georgia and Florida, where fresh-faced African-American Democratic candidates for governor trailed their older, white Republican competitors. In Georgia, Stacey Abrams hasn\u2019t conceded her race while Andrew Gillum\u2019s contest in Florida is undergoing a recount.\n\nFor some Democrats, the lesson emerging from the 2018 midterms is that massive turnout can win suburban House races across New Jersey, Pennsylvania and California. But the coalition that produced some success elsewhere may not be enough in Florida, the nation\u2019s premier presidential battleground state, and Georgia, a state Democrats view with increasing optimism.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a viable long-term plan to constantly rely on record turnout,\u201d said Democratic strategist Steve Schale, who led former President Barack Obama\u2019s efforts in Florida. \u201cWe have a national issue we have to deal with.\u201d\n\nWhile Gillum and Abrams have much in common, they ran on different messages.\n\nGillum, the 39-year-old mayor of Florida\u2019s capital city, ran as an unapologetic member of the Trump resistance. He openly called for President Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment. And he accused his Republican opponent, former Rep. Ron DeSantis, of blatant racism.\n\nAbrams, the 44-year-old former minority leader in Georgia\u2019s House of Representative, highlighted her bipartisan credentials throughout her bid for governor. While she and Gillum embraced liberal policy priorities, such as \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d she promoted her work with Republicans in the state legislature, even highlighting a handshake with GOP Gov. Nathan Deal in a campaign ad.\n\nStill, both were viewed as rising stars within the evolving Democratic Party, a new generation of Democratic leadership that could expand the party\u2019s appeal among all voters.\n\nRacial divisions appear to have limited their appeal, however.\n\nBoth Gillum and Abrams won African-Americans and young voters by overwhelming margins. But they struggled with older, white voters, particularly noncollege-educated white voters, who make up the core of Trump\u2019s political base.\n\nGillum won 92 percent of black voters, according to VoteCast, a wide-ranging survey of the electorate conducted by The Associated Press. He also won 60 percent of voters 18 to 29 years old, and 54 percent of women.\n\nBut Gillum earned just 44 percent of the male vote. And he won only 39 percent of the overall white vote \u2014 and 35 percent among noncollege-educated white voters.\n\nIt was worse for Abrams, who was poised to become the nation\u2019s first African-American female governor.\n\nShe won 94 percent of Georgia\u2019s black vote, but just 25 percent of white voters. She carried 56 percent of women, but just 40 percent of men. A dismal 19 percent of noncollege-educated white men supported her, according to VoteCast.\n\nNationwide, 43 percent of white voters backed Democrats, including 38 percent of noncollege-educated whites.\n\nThe results \u201cabsolutely\u201d demonstrated black candidates like Gillum and Abrams have a harder time winning in the Trump era, NAACP President Derrick Johnson told the AP.\n\n\u201cWhat the president has done is played to the lowest common denominator and created a culture of intolerance and racial hatred,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cYou build up negative energy based on fear to a point where there are segments of the population who are reacting to fear and not pure policy considerations.\u201d\n\nLeading Democratic pollster Stan Greenberg agreed that racism likely shaped the elections.\n\n\u201cThis was a big election in which the president used immigration to send a kind of racist message about the need to stand up whites against the invasion,\u201d Greenberg said of Trump\u2019s final-days focus on a caravan of Latin American immigrants heading to the U.S. border to seek asylum.\n\nTrump and his allies took \u201cevery opportunity,\u201d he continued, \u201cto attack black politicians and athletes and others. It\u2019s not subtle in terms of what they\u2019ve done.\u201d\n\nGreenberg acknowledged Democrats\u2019 nationwide struggle among working-class white men, but he highlighted Gillum and Abrams\u2019 ability to drive tremendous turnout overall.\n\nWith votes still being counted, Gillum received more than 4 million votes, shattering the previous midterm record set in 2014 by Democratic gubernatorial candidate Charlie Crist, who earned 2.8 million votes. While significantly fewer voters typically participate in off-year elections, Gillum came close to matching Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 total of 4.5 million votes.\n\nIt was much the same in Georgia, a smaller state, where Abrams actually exceeded Clinton\u2019s 2016 vote total, earning a midterm Democratic record 1.9 million votes.\n\nBut so far, at least, the Republican candidates in both states earned more votes.\n\nThe dynamic does not bode well for Democrats\u2019 fight to deny Trump a second term, even as America grows more diverse.\n\nSchale said Democrats in Florida and Georgia \u2014 and others \u2014 must do a better job managing their losses among voters in Republican-leaning regions, which are increasingly turning away from his party. It\u2019s unclear, however, how exactly to do that.\n\n\u201cIn a lot of places right now, it\u2019s very foreign to vote for a Democrat,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to find a way to broaden the appeal.\u201d", "ALBANY, N.Y.

That led to a biopsy and some anxious hours as she waited for the results.\n\n\u201cFinally, she called me and said, \u2018You have breast cancer,\u2019\u201d Ben-Or recalled. \u201cI just felt everything in myself collapse.

So while she could have undergone radiation followed up by mammograms and MRIs twice a year, she opted for bilateral mastectomy and reconstruction.\n\n\u201cI was scared of it coming back,\u201d she said.\n\nChemotherapy and its accompanying nausea, pain, exhaustion and hair loss came next.\n\nBen-Or found comfort in talking to other cancer patients, including a woman at the grocery store also undergoing chemo who spotted her bald head and asked about her treatments.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard dealing with the nausea and pain.

(AP Photo/Manu Fernandez)\n\nBARCELONA, Spain (AP) \u2014 Real Betis coach Quique Setien likes to say that he would give his little finger to have had the honor of playing for Johan Cruyff.\n\nThat didn\u2019t stop him for masterminding a 4-3 victory Sunday at Barcelona, a team that claims Cruyff as the creator of its playing style.\n\n\u201cThis is a game to put in a frame,\u201d Setien said. \u201cTo win here and score four goals is something that will be remembered always. Anybody who likes football and cares about more than just getting a result will have liked this match.\u201d\n\nThe 60-year-old Setien is a former Spain midfielder who is trying to make Betis not just a winner, but a proponent of the beautiful game.\n\nSince arriving at Betis at the start of the 2017-18 season, Setien has installed a three-man defense, a formation that Cruyff used to great success when he coached Barcelona to the club\u2019s first European Cup in 1992 and four consecutive Spanish league titles from 1991-94.\n\nThe formation\u2014 and Betis\u2019 aggressive attitude\u2014 proved key to dealing Barcelona its first home loss in la Liga in over two years.\n\n\u201cBarcelona has been setting the standard for 20 to 25 years and we are trying to establish our identity,\u201d Setien said. \u201cBarcelona\u2019s fans have been watching this kind of football for many years, while we are still apprentices.\n\n\u201cI am thrilled with our match today. It is a huge boost to what we are doing because there are some people who don\u2019t believe in this way of playing.\u201d\n\nBetis fans had good reason to question Setien\u2019s methods after a sixth-place finish last campaign.\n\nThe Sevilla-based club had very little to show from its open, flowing passing game.\n\nA squad packed with playmakers such as Joaquin Sanchez, Sergio Canales and Takashi Inui, lacked quality strikers. Before the visit to Barcelona, Betis was the lowest-scoring team in the league along with Valencia after just notching eight goals in 11 matches.\n\nThree of those previous goals were scored in a 3-3 draw at Celta Vigo in the prior round, and more goals came at Camp Nou.\n\nBesides his appreciation of Cruyff\u2019s tactics, Setien also credits his love for chess with helping his understanding of soccer. Setien says one of his highlights as a chess player was his participation in simultaneous exhibitions against chess legends Garry Kasparov and Anatoly Karpov.\n\nChess, he says, taught him \u201cpatience, capacity for analysis, emotional control.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd perspective. It\u2019s not about where the pieces are now, but where they will be after a series of moves,\u201d Setien told Spanish newspaper El Periodico recently.\n\nSetien\u2019s use of five players in midfield allowed Betis to pressure high up the pitch and mount quick attacks in large numbers.\n\nLeft wing back Junio Firpo scored the opener after being sprung by a perfectly-weighted pass from William Carvalho.\n\nThe two combined to start another attack that finished with six Betis attackers against four defenders and Sanchez making it 2-0 before halftime.\n\n\u201cWe were a brave team, we played a great game,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cWe showed the finish touch we were missing in other matches.\u201d\n\nBarcelona manager Ernesto Valverde sacrificed the passing and ball-control provided by Arthur for the punch of Arturo Vidal at halftime.\n\nThe result was Barcelona scoring all three of its goals, including two by Lionel Messi and one by Vidal. But Betis also scored twice after halftime when Giovani Lo Celso was left unmarked arriving from midfield before Firpo set up Canales to take the goal that proved to be the winner.\n\n\u201cIn the trading of blows we couldn\u2019t control the situation,\u201d Valverde said. \u201cEach time we got closer they hit us right back.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "PSG's Neymar celebrates with teammate Edinson Cavani after scoring his side's forth goal during the French League One soccer match between AS Monaco and Paris Saint-Germain at Stade Louis II in Monaco, Sunday, Nov. 11, 2018 (AP Photo/Claude Paris)\n\nPARIS (AP) \u2014 Monaco\u2019s 4-0 loss at home to Paris Saint-Germain on Sunday displayed the alarming hallmarks of a lopsided league where beaten teams seem both helpless against and utterly in awe of PSG.\n\nIt was a poor advertisement for the French league and did nothing to change the perception that PSG will win the title with ease, and perhaps without losing a game, such is the club\u2019s level of domestic dominance.\n\nWorse still, in terms of image for Ligue 1, was a Monaco player laughing with Paris Saint-Germain forward Kylian Mbappe as they walked off at halftime. His team was trailing 2-0 at the time.\n\nThen, PSG stars Neymar and Mbappe shared a joke and smiled broadly as they came back out for the second half.\n\nAfter the final whistle, Monaco coach Thierry Henry was seen on television exchanging pleasantries with PSG\u2019s president in the stadium corridor, his defeated players waiting in the dressing room.\n\nHenry\u2019s Monaco lineup is winless in 16 games overall \u2014 sixth of those since he took charge \u2014 and languishing in 19th spot level on points with last-placed Guingamp. By contrast, PSG has won 13 of 13 league games and scored 45 goals for only seven conceded.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to say it was easy,\u201d PSG striker Edinson Cavani said after scoring a hat trick. \u201cBut Monaco\u2019s not in a good period.\u201d\n\nCavani, who is known for his work ethic and for being unselfish, was clearly being diplomatic. This win was easy, particularly since PSG had two other goals ruled out, and the glaring evidence is that the league\u2019s other teams are resigned to defeat when up against PSG.\n\nBut this ultimately works against PSG in Europe, where the club continues to struggle in the Champions League and is facing elimination from the group stage after failing to beat either Napoli \u2014 twice \u2014 or last season\u2019s runner-up Liverpool. With two games left, PSG has five points from four games and is third in the group.\n\nOdd then, that Neymar should dance so gleefully in front of PSG\u2019s fans after netting the fourth goal Sunday from the penalty spot against a Monaco lineup riddled with injuries and featuring five players aged 19 or under.\n\nIt appeared somewhat brazen too, that coach Thomas Tuchel should be smiling and whispering to a grinning assistant coach as they walked off the pitch at the final whistle with hands cupped over their mouths to prevent lip reading.\n\nTuchel needs to be careful not to lose track of what he has set out to do at PSG, which is bringing a greater intensity to his team. At times, this was absent against Monaco when the goals came largely through poor defending rather than exceptional PSG teamwork.\n\n\u201cWe showed our hunger for a 13th win,\u201d Tuchel said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not satisfied with the intensity, the structure of the team, the quality of our play.\u201d\n\nDespite saying this, Tuchel did not intervene to stop Neymar and Mbappe appearing too casual as they often sought to pick each other out with passes at the expense of their teammates.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t play very well,\u201d PSG defender Presnel Kimpembe said on Canal Plus television. Perhaps Kimpembe\u2019s teammates should take it on board.\n\nAfter the international break, PSG faces 15th-placed Toulouse, a team which has among the worst attacking and defensive records in the league. Four days later, it\u2019s a far taller order as PSG faces Liverpool in a match which could decide PSG\u2019s Champions League fate.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "Today in History\n\nToday is Monday, Nov. 12, the 316th day of 2018.

It\u2019s a lot better that way.\u201d\n\nGarland and Shittu, who were five-star prospects in high school, are off to strong starts. Garland, a 6-2 guard, is averaging 22.5 points and has led the Commodores in scoring both games. Shittu, a 6-foot-10 forward, has double doubles in his first two games and is averaging 16 points and 12.5 rebounds. Aaron Nesmith, a four-star recruit, also was in double figures with 10 points.\n\nThe Commodores (2-0) led for most of the game but trailed 69-67 with 3:11 remaining after a Jonah Mathews layup. Vanderbilt (2-0) was able to seize control again with a 9-2 run as four different players scored. They were 5 of 6 from the line during that stretch while USC was 1 of 5 from the field and committed three turnovers.\n\n\u201cWe fought hard and executed all the way to the end. It\u2019s big a deal to hit our free throws and win a big game like this on the road,\u201d Garland said.\n\nDerryck Thornton got USC (1-1) within 76-74 with 14 seconds on a layup while being fouled by Shittu but was unable to make the ensuing free throw.\n\nVanderbilt was 11 of 12 from the line in the final three minutes. Senior Joe Toye scored five of his 16 points down the stretch.\n\nNick Rakocevic led the Trojans with 19 points and 18 rebounds while Thornton added 17 points and Kevin Porter Jr. 14.\n\n\u201cWe had momentum and the lead, and then had some turnovers and missed shots,\u201d USC coach Andy Enfield said. \u201cWe have to recognize what we need to do to win games. Turnovers and quick shots aren\u2019t the recipe for success.\u201d\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nVanderbilt: Garland said he was pleased with win but lamented the errors the Commodores made on the defensive end.as they allowed USC to get 21 offensive rebounds. \u201cWe made too many defensive mistakes and I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll dwell on that in practice this week,\u201d he said.\n\nUSC: Porter, who scored 11 of the Trojans\u2019 first 15 points, has been an impressive scorer in his first two games but has been in foul trouble in both. He needs to correct that during nonconference play if he is going to have more of an impact for the Trojans this season.\n\nINJURIES\n\nThe Trojans continue to lack depth.

That was the lowest number of pass attempts through three quarters in his seven-year career.\n\nA turnover by Wilson has loomed large in both of Seattle\u2019s recent losses. Last Sunday against the Chargers, he threw an interception in the fourth quarter that was returned for a touchdown. This week, he fumbled the ball on a strip sack by Rams linebacker Dante Fowler that was recovered at the Seahawks\u2019 nine yard line with less than six minutes remaining. One play later, Brandon Cooks scored on a nine-yard run to give Los Angeles a 36-24 lead.\n\nSeattle scored on its ensuing possession and got the ball back after holding the Rams to a three-and-out. Wilson got Seattle to the Rams 36 yard line with 39 seconds remaining, but three straight incompletions ended any hopes of a comeback.\n\nThe Seahawks haven\u2019t been able to force a turnover in either loss, which has frustrated the defense.\n\n\u201cWe just needed one tip ball or on the ground to flip the script and we didn\u2019t come up with it,\u201d defensive end Dion Jordan said. \u201cWe played these good teams hard twice and didn\u2019t come up with the win. Pete doesn\u2019t want us to get down on ourselves. This has to be turning point for us going into these last couple games.\u201d\n\nSeattle\u2019s decision to call a surprise onside kick down 26-24 with under 10 minutes remaining ended up costing them. Carroll said Sebastian Janikowski hit the ball wrong, which led to an easy recovery by Rams wide receiver Josh Reynolds.

He was 8 of 13 from beyond the arc Sunday.\n\nLopez said Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer and his staff have been telling their players to have faith in their shot and their shooting judgment.\n\n\u201cBud and our entire coaching staff have done a great job instilling that confidence and giving us that belief that when we shoot, it\u2019s going to go in,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cIf you\u2019re open and that\u2019s your shot, let it fly.\u201d\n\nUp by four at the break, the Bucks stretched their lead to 99-88 going into the final quarter after Antetokounmpo connected on an 11-foot step-back jumper with just over a second remaining in the third quarter.\n\nThe Nuggets chipped away at the deficit and pulled into a 103-all tie on a 3-pointer by Jamal Murray with little more than eight minutes remaining.\n\nThe game remained tight until Brogdon connected on a 3-pointer and Middleton hit a jumper around successive Nuggets\u2019 turnovers to give the Bucks a 117-112 lead with 41.6 seconds remaining.

The final rebounding margin was 49-25.\n\nMichigan State: It was an impressive all-around game for Ward, who not only contributed points and rebounds but also had a career-high four assists.

He is the favorite to replace U.S. interim coach Dave Sarachan, who has led the Americans for 13 months since Bruce Arena quit after they failed to qualify for this year\u2019s World Cup.\n\nIn line to become the first player to appear in a World Cup for the U.S. and coach the national team, the 45-year-old Berhalter led low-budget Columbus to the playoffs four times, losing to Portland in the 2015 MLS final and getting eliminated in the conference final in 2014 and the conference semifinals in 2014 and this year.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s in Columbus is an identity, a way to play, giving the players belief and making players better. That\u2019s what we did for a long time,\u201d he said.\n\nIn dark pants, sweater, jacket and shoes, a dark scarf slung around his neck, Berhalter dressed in the style of Pep Guardiola, And his shaved head also resembles the world soccer\u2019s top coach.\n\n\u201cThe reality of trying to break them down is not always so easy,\u201d Armas said. \u201cAnd then of course you can talk about with the ball how good they are. They can unbalance you and they can give you fits.\u201d\n\nColumbus, which beat the Red Bulls in the 2008 MLS final and the 2015 conference final, was in danger of being moved to Austin, Texas, for 2019 before MLS announced Oct. 12 that owner Precourt Sports Ventures intends to launch an expansion team in Austin and the league is working with the Haslam and Edwards families to keep the team in Columbus.\n\n\u201cTo us it became more than that and blocking out distractions,\u201d Berhalter said. \u201cThe guys stayed focused, didn\u2019t make excuses for themselves and wanted to get better, and that\u2019s all you can ask of them.\u201d\n\nWhile the announced crowd was 22,789, Red Bull Arena appeared two-thirds full on a night with a kickoff temperature in the low 40s, New York evened the aggregate after Sean Davis sent a free kick from 35 yards on the right flank into the penalty area. Royer headed the ball down and defender Aaron Long kicked it toward goalkeeper Zack Steffen from 7 yards. The ball deflected off Muyl\u2019s right foot and in for the 23-year-old midfielder\u2019s first playoff goal.\n\nNew York moved midfielder Tyler Adams higher to push its attack, giving Columbus difficulty, but the Crew started to have more chances in the second half. The Red Bulls took the aggregate lead in the 73rd minute following an eight-pass sequence on the left side that included Adams, Tim Parker, Davis and Alejandro Romero Gamarra. After Bradley Wright-Phillips played a long diagonal pass to Muyl in the penalty arc, Muyl spun, played the ball from his right foot to his left and passed through three defenders to Adams. He one-touched the ball to Royer, who had broken away from Jonathan Mensah 8 yards out, and beat Steffen with a right-footed shot.\n\n\u201cThat was so quick,\u201d said the Austrian winger, who had 11 goals during the regular season. \u201cAll of a sudden I was there all alone.\u201d\n\nWhen Davis knocked the ball away from Justin Meram in the Columbus half in the 76th, Michael Murillo played long pass to Gamarra, who sent the ball to Royer on the left flank. Royer drove toward the penalty area and from inside the arc put the ball just under the crossbar . As Royer did a front flip and then a back flip, more red flares went off from the Empires Supporters Club behind the goal.\n\nBerhalter sounded wistful.\n\n\u201cOverall, not enough on the night,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "Miami Dolphins quarterback Brock Osweiler fumbles the ball during the first half of an NFL football game against the Green Bay Packers Sunday, Nov. 11, 2018, in Green Bay, Wis.

He got sacked six times, including three straight plays late in the game. And he accounted for another turnover after throwing an interception to Bashaud Breeland that was returned 26 yards to the Miami 12 with 8:52 left in the third quarter.\n\nThe Packers cashed in on that turnover too, with Rodgers hitting Davante Adams for a 25-yard touchdown pass for a 16-point lead three plays later.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the only guy on the team that touches the ball every play on offense, and I need to find ways to be better and to score touchdowns,\u201d Osweiler said.\n\nThe offense was undermanned, though.\n\nStarting tackles Laremy Tunsil (knee, ankle) and Ja\u2019Wuan James (knee), along with starting guard Ted Larsen (neck), were inactive. For a while, the Dolphins still moved the ball effectively, especially early in the game.\n\nRunning back Kenyan Drake had a knee injury in the second quarter.

They\u2019re 5-7 this season and in 12th place in the Western Conference.\n\nHouston was up by 10 with about four minutes left after five quick points by the Pacers, but Harden made two free throws after that to stretch the lead. The Pacers got within 8 on a basket by Cory Joseph with about 90 seconds left, but Paul made a layup a few seconds later to put the game out of reach.\n\nVictor Oladipo had 22 for the Pacers, who have lost three of their last four games.\n\n\u201cWe knew they were very capable of getting hot even though they hadn\u2019t shot the ball well early this season,\u201d Indiana coach Nate McMillan said. \u201cWe knew they were very capable and tonight they did. It was tough matchups trying to stop those guys.\u201d\n\nThe win comes as the Rockets deal with a disappointing start to the season and rumors and reports about Carmelo Anthony\u2019s status and future with the team. Anthony, who is in his first year in Houston, sat out for the second straight game with an undisclosed illness on a day the New York Times had a sourced report that said he had been told he would soon be waived.\n\nGeneral manager Daryl Morey said before the game that the report was \u201cinaccurate\u201d and that singling Anthony out as the cause of Houston\u2019s struggles was unfair.\n\nThe Rockets, who entered the game ranking near the bottom of the league with a 3-point shooting percentage of just 31.7, shot 42.6 percent from long-range and made a season-high 20 3s on Sunday night.

They made a great run, Zhang hit a lot of 3s for them, a lot of quick buckets. So next time we\u2019ve just got to know that no game is going to be easy.\u201d\n\nThe Seminoles, who are have their sights set on a third-straight NCAA tournament berth, and who advanced to the regional finals last spring, kept their composure in the crunch in the face of a packed and loud home-opening crowd in Tulane\u2019s cozy Devlin Fieldhouse.\n\nChrist Koumadje\u2019s dunk sparked a 10-0 Seminoles run that included layups by Mann and Trent Forest, and FSU maintained a double-digit lead for most of the final seven minutes.\n\n\u201cWe handled it pretty well for the most part,\u201d Mann said. \u201cGetting through that, we\u2019ve got to learn from it.\u201d\n\nForrest finished with 13 points and Mfiondu Kabengele scored 12 for Florida State (2-0), which shot 48.3 percent (29 of 60).\n\nSamir Sehic scored 19 points for Tulane (0-1), but took only four shots in the second half and missed all of them.\n\nTulane coach Mike Dunleavy said he was \u201cvery encouraged\u201d by several aspects of his team\u2019s opening performance.\n\n\u201cWe did OK,\u201d he said. \u201cWe got ourselves back into it.\u201d\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nFlorida State: The Seminoles have yet to play this season with star forward Phil Cofer, who is out indefinitely with a foot injury. It hasn\u2019t mattered yet, thanks largely to their depth and ability to play lock-down defense for pivotal stretches. In addition to holding Tulane without a field goal for more than a 10-minute stretch in the middle of the he game, FSU forced 18 Tulane turnovers and converted them into 20 points. That defensive performance came after limiting Florida to 37 percent shooting in a season-opening win on Tuesday.\n\nTulane: The Green Wave delighted a packed home-opening crowd to a high-energy effort that kept the game competitive for significant stretches. That kind of showing \u2014 particularly with starting point guard Ray Ona Embo sitting out as he recovers from a knee injury \u2014 should give the Wave hope they can be more competitive in the American Athletic Conference this season.\n\nAUSPICIOUS DEBUT\n\nTulane could not have hoped for much more from Zhang, who scored on everything from four 3-pointers to a driving tomahawk dunk.\n\n\u201cBefore the game I was a little nervous, but coach told me to just play hard,\u201d said Zhang, who moved from China to the United State at age 14. \u201cIn the second half, I was trying to win the game, be aggressive.\u201d\n\nMann said he knew nothing about Zhang before the game, but added, \u201cnow I do, man. I\u2019m going to be following him. He\u2019s really good.\u201d\n\nDEFENSIVE PRESSURE\n\nAfter Jordan Cornish scored with 7:33 left in the half, FSU held the Green Wave without a field goal until 16:25 remained in the second half.\n\n\u201cWe like to take pride in shutting people down,\u201d Mann said. \u201cIf somebody gets hot, you know, there\u2019s nothing we ca do about it \u2014 like Zhang did.

Twenty years after his father almost bargained them away for a pair of nuclear reactors, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has his nuclear weapons - and a nation still plagued by chronic blackouts.

(AP Photo/Dita Alangkara)\n\nPYONGYANG, North Korea (AP) \u2014 More than 20 years after his father almost bargained them away for a pair of nuclear reactors, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has his nuclear weapons \u2014 and a nation still plagued by chronic blackouts.\n\nEven on the clearest days, plumes of smoke from two towering chimneys linger over the center of Pyongyang. The Soviet-era Pyongyang Combined Heat and Power Plant smokestacks are one of the North Korean capital\u2019s most recognizable landmarks.\n\nPossibly more than anything else, this is Kim Jong Un\u2019s Achilles heel as he turns his attention from developing the country\u2019s nuclear weapons arsenal to building its economy.\n\nIf stalled nuclear talks with Washington ever get back on track, helping Kim solve his country\u2019s chronic energy deficit could be one of the biggest carrots President Trump has to offer. Washington, Seoul and Tokyo tried that back in the 1990s, and were even ready to pay for and build those two reactors Kim\u2019s father wanted.\n\nYears of intensive sanctions have severely impacted North Korea\u2019s supply of fossil fuels from the outside world, but they also have spurred the country to cobble together a smorgasbord of energy resources, some of them off the grid and some of them flat-out illegal.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at where Kim stands and what he is doing to win his country\u2019s real struggle for power.\n\n___\n\nTHE BIG PICTURE\n\nAmong the most iconic images of North Korea are nighttime satellite photos that reveal it as an inky abyss ringed by the bright lights of China, South Korea and Japan.\n\nThe whole nation of 25 million people uses about the same amount of electricity each year as Washington alone. It uses as much crude oil in a year as the U.S. consumes in just 12 hours. South Korea has about twice the population of the North, but its electricity consumption in 2014 was about 40 times bigger.\n\nHydroelectricity, which is subject to seasonal swings, provides about half of the fuel supplied to the national energy grid. Coal accounts for the other half.\n\nThe grid is leaky, archaic and badly needing repairs.\n\nThat smoke-spewing power plant in the capital, which supplies much of the power and hot water needs for central Pyongyang, dates to the 1960s. Lights in the huge concrete apartment blocks of Tongil Boulevard across town stay lit thanks largely to the East Pyongyang Thermal Power Station \u2014 built by the Soviet Union in the 1980s.\n\nWhat electricity there is is unevenly distributed.\n\nThe showcase capital and cities near coal or hydroelectric power plants get the best coverage. Military facilities also take precedence and often have their own supply. So do important party and government operations, some of the higher-profile residences and hotels in the capital and even some restaurants. Lights used to illuminate portraits of the leaders at night never go out.\n\nStill, it\u2019s not uncommon for the power even in many higher status locations to flicker on and off. Dancing beams of flashlights are commonplace on the streets or in otherwise darkened apartments. In rural villages, even that often fades to black.\n\n___\n\nKEEPING THE OIL FLOWING ...\n\nNorth Korea must import about 3 million to 4 million barrels of crude oil each year to sustain its economy.\n\nMost of it flows through one pipeline.\n\nThe China-North Korea \u201cFriendship Oil Pipeline\u201d runs from the border city of Dandong under the Yalu River to a storage facility on the North Korean side about 13 kilometers (10 miles) outside the city of Sinuiju. From there, some is sent across country by truck or rail to the east coast, where it is stored at the port of Munchon. More is transported to Pyongyang for priority recipients such as the military, government departments and state enterprises, and to the port of Nampo, southwest of Pyongyang.\n\nThe pipeline \u2014technically there are two, one for crude and the other for refined products \u2014 was built between 1974 and 1976.\n\nNorth Korea used to have two refineries. The pipeline from China terminates at the Ponghwa Chemical Factory, which produces gasoline and diesel. The other refinery was built by the Soviet Union in the north near the Rason Special Economic Zone in the 1970s. It shut down in 1995 with the collapse of the Soviet empire. The pipeline that connected it with Siberia has long been out of use.\n\nUnder U.N. sanctions imposed late last year, North Korea can import a maximum 500,000 barrels of refined oil products along with 4 million barrels of crude oil per year.\n\nAlong with its Chinese connection, the North has been supplied by Russian tankers that ship oil and petroleum products to Munchon and another east coast port, Hungnam. It has found willing suppliers in the Middle East, or on the open market.\n\nSince the imposition of the import cap, Pyongyang has been implicated in increasingly sophisticated schemes to augment its supplies with hard-to-track transfers of oil by tankers at sea.\n\nWashington\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, told the Security Council in September the United States tracked at least 148 instances of oil tankers delivering refined petroleum products obtained through illegal ship-to-ship transfers in the first eight months of this year. She claimed the amount of illegally transferred oil \u2014 about 800,000 barrels \u2014 was 160 percent of the annual 500,000 barrel cap.\n\n\u201cIn reality, we think they have obtained four times the annual quota in the first eight months of this year,\u201d Haley said.\n\n___\n\n... AND GOING OFF THE GRID\n\nDavid von Hippel and Peter Hayes of the Nautilus Institute have been following North Korea\u2019s energy issue for years.\n\nComparing Chinese trade figures from 2000 through 2017, they found explosive growth in North Korea\u2019s imports of passenger cars and trucks that put an additional 107,000 vehicles on its roads. Tractor sales also rose and sales of \u201celectricity propelled\u201d bicycles or scooters, a category that wasn\u2019t even listed until last year, doubled to 128,000.\n\nThe truck and tractor sales almost certainly reflect an upgrade to the North\u2019s transportation and agricultural sectors. Being able to get around is a key to doing business in a market-centric economy, and so is having enough spending power to buy things like electric scooters.\n\nMoreover, in a study released this month, Hayes and von Hippel also found that imports of diesel- and gasoline-powered generators, coupled with solar panels that are already ubiquitous in the North, are creating an energy system increasingly independent of the national power grid.\n\n\u201cThe data ... reinforces a picture of a DPRK in which a more vibrant, modernizing, increasingly (at least functionally) market-based economy is providing households, business and institutions with the wherewithal to invest in both off-grid electricity supplies and increased transport services,\u201d they wrote, using the acronym for the North\u2019s official name.\n\nStill, keeping the power on often can be an elaborate routine.\n\nSolar panels, the cheapest option, can keep a room lit, a mobile phone working and maybe a TV or another appliance going. When electricity from the grid is actually flowing, it can be used to charge batteries before the next blackout hits.\n\nThose with a little more clout or money use diesel- or gas-powered generators that can power anything from a restaurant to an apartment block.\n\nOr a military installation.\n\n___\n\nTalmadge is the AP\u2019s Pyongyang bureau chief.

Pine mushrooms are white and brown fungi that are considered a healthy delicacy in both Koreas and other Asian countries. They are one of the North\u2019s most prized regional products, and the country shipped them to South Korea in 2000 and 2007 after previous summit talks.\n\nAfter their summit, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un also gave Moon a gift of two dogs, both white Pungsans. On Monday, Moon tweeted that one of the dogs, named Gomi, gave birth to six healthy puppies last Friday.\n\n\u201cSix dogs were added to a gift of two dogs. I cannot help saying it\u2019s a big fortune and I hope that South-North ties will be like this,\u201d Moon said.\n\nPungsan is a dog breed native to North Korea and is best known for its loyalty and bravery during hunting. North Korea sent a pair of Pungsans to South Korea after the 2000 summit, and South Korea gave two indigenous Jindo dogs to the North.\n\nDespite warming ties between the Koreas, there have been no major recent breakthroughs in U.S.-led diplomacy aimed at stripping North Korea of its nuclear program.\n\nAccording to officials in Seoul and Washington, North Korea recently postponed high-level talks with the United States on the North\u2019s disarmament and on setting up a second summit between President Donald Trump and Kim.\n\nAfter a provocative series of nuclear and missile tests last year, North Korea entered talks with the United States and South Korea this year, saying it\u2019s willing to deal away its growing nuclear weapons arsenal. The North has since taken measures such as dismantling its nuclear test site and parts of its rocket-engine testing facility, but U.S. officials want it to take more significant, irreversible steps toward denuclearization.\n\nMoon, who has met Kim three times this year, believes that better ties between the Koreas will help resolve the nuclear issue.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s Unification Ministry said Monday it has approved a visit by seven North Koreans to attend an academic forum in the South later this week. The forum is on regional issues, including Japan\u2019s wartime mobilization of laborers in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nSeoul said Saturday that the two Koreas have finished withdrawing troops and firearms from some of their front-line guard posts as part of their agreements to lower military tensions.

Although the perfect season ended last week in New Orleans, Los Angeles still has never lost back-to-back games under coach Sean McVay.\n\n\u201cIt means a lot, (because) there\u2019s a lot of tragedy that\u2019s been going on,\u201d said Aaron Donald, who had 2\u00bd sacks of Wilson after evacuating his family during the week. \u201cWe\u2019ve all been affected by it.

They came out in the second and I think we withstood that pressure by them.\u201d\n\nVinnie Hinostroza and Galchenyuk scored the fifth and sixth goals Washington\u2019s penalty kill has allowed over its last four games, helping Arizona snap a three-game skid and erase the frustration of a 4-0 defeat in Pittsburgh on Saturday night.\n\nDarcy Kuemper made 38 saves for the Coyotes in his third start in four days.

Panik also contributed on the crisp odd-man rush by the Coyotes, created when three Capitals players were caught up ice trying to score short-handed.\n\nArizona caught Washington in transition again when Panik beat Holtby above his left shoulder to make it 2-0 just beyond the midpoint of the second period.\n\nBackstrom answered less than a minute later with a one-timer off Alex Ovechkin\u2019s feed from the left corner that left Kuemper little chance.\n\nBut the Coyotes made it a two-goal lead again with another power-play goal with 5:22 left in the period.

I still think we can play a little bit better, and Tata continues to push us. It\u2019s just an extra motivating factor. We all want to win. We all want to be champions. That would be icing on the cake, for sure.\u201d\n\nDuring the pregame festivities, United\u2019s fans unveiled a towering, statue-like tifo of Martino that showed the coach in his trademark pose \u2014 arms crossed and a sweater tied over his shoulders. \u201cEl Tata\u201d was written on the base.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been very involved with everything Atlanta United \u2014 with the players, the club, the fans,\u201d Martino said through a translator. \u201cIt\u2019s great that their recognizing that.

The Red Bulls beat Columbus 3-0 on Sunday night for a 3-1 aggregate victory.\n\nWith New York City pressing hard, knowing it would need two goals to advance, United wrapped up the series. Eric Remedi sent a brilliantly timed pass to Martinez, who was able to stay onside because Valentin Castellanos was lingering too deep in the zone out on the wing. Martinez controlled the ball with his shoulder, looked around for any signs of a challenge and blasted a shot past helpless keeper Sean Johnson.\n\nFrom there, the celebration was on. The big crowd pushed United past 1 million fans for the season and broke the Major League Soccer playoff record of 67,221 for last season\u2019s loss to the Crew.\n\n\u201cYou run out of superlatives,\u201d Parkhurst said. \u201cSome guys might take it for granted, but most of us don\u2019t. We understand what a privilege, what an honor it is to play in front of this crowd. Not everybody has that opportunity. I\u2019m just glad we put on a good performance tonight to match their energy.\u201d\n\nNot playing it safe, United went ahead in the 25th minute on Martinez\u2019s penalty kick, which was set up by Darlington Nagbe\u2019s long pass to Franco Escobar near the end line. Ismael Tajouri-Shradi converged on the Atlanta player, taking him down as he tried to spin away, prompting referee Mark Geiger to point immediately to the spot.\n\nMartinez gave a little hesitation as he approached the ball, slipping his shot inside the right post while Johnson dove left .\n\nAtlanta built a commanding 3-0 lead on aggregate when Miguel Almiron scored off a free kick in the 42nd. It began with a sloppy pass from Yangel Herrera, which was picked off by Almiron to send him flying toward the area. Herrera grabbed at the United star, both pulling him down and tripping him for a yellow card that easily could\u2019ve been a red.\n\nAlmiron took the kick from about 25 meters, curling a left-footer over the wall and into the top left corner , just beyond the grasp of a leaping Johnson.\n\nBut New York City gave itself hope of pulling out the series with a goal late in the half after Escobar\u2019s hard tackle brought out another yellow card. The free kick deflected off an Atlanta player in the wall and went right to Maxime Chanot.\n\nEscobar compounded his initial mistakes by failing to mark Chanot, who easily headed it past keeper Brad Guzan in the 45th.\n\nThat turned out to be New York City\u2019s only goal in the series. The team lost for the third straight year in the conference semifinals.\n\n\u201cThe most frustrating thing to have such a talented group to come up empty-handed in two games,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cNot just one, but two games.

That\u2019s not something I concern myself with,\u201d Fitzpatrick said. \u201cIf I get a chance to go out there, I try and do my best and play as hard as I can.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "1 of 4 Connecticut's Alterique Gilbert (3) battles for position against UMKC's Marvin Nesbitt Jr. (33) and UMKC's Jordan Giles (5) in the first half of an NCAA college basketball game, Sunday, Nov. 11, 2018, in Storrs, Conn.

The Colts defeated the Jaguars 29-26. (AP Photo/Darron Cummings)\n\nINDIANAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 Jacksonville cornerback Jalen Ramsey had plenty to say this summer.\n\nNow that the temperatures are cooling, Ramsey seems to be toning down the rhetoric.\n\nHe may not have many more chances this season to get the league\u2019s attention. After a late fumble sealed the Jaguars\u2019 fifth straight loss, 29-26 at Indianapolis on Sunday, the Jaguars (3-6) find themselves sitting alone in the AFC South basement with their playoff hopes fading fast and the search for answers becoming increasingly more urgent.\n\nNobody sounds more frustrated than Ramsey.\n\n\u201cThings happen,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to try to bounce back from it. But we dug ourselves too big of a hole today.\u201d\n\nRamsey didn\u2019t stick around long following the game \u2014 and he didn\u2019t say much.\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t require too much thought to understand why last year\u2019s AFC runner-ups have made a mess of this season.\n\nAndrew Luck threw three touchdown passes and took the Colts (4-5) on four scoring marches before halftime to give Indy a 29-13 lead. The three-time Pro Bowl quarterback produced only two first downs in the second half but still finished 21 of 29 with 285 yards and one interception \u2014 playing far better than Ramsey suggested when he said of Luck in August, \u201cI don\u2019t really think he\u2019s that good.\u201d\n\nWhat Luck did was expose the Jags\u2019 mismatches by repeatedly going to his tight ends. Eric Ebron , Jack Doyle and Mo Alie-Cox combined for eight catches, 133 yards and three TD receptions \u2014 all in the first two quarters.\n\nAnd with Ramsey\u2019s tag-teaming cornerback A.J. Bouye out because of an injured calf, Luck didn\u2019t really have to throw at Ramsey much.\n\nPerhaps the most remarkable difference between this game and last year\u2019s was that the Jags couldn\u2019t put much pressure on Luck. After recording 14 sacks against the Colts last year, Luck didn\u2019t go down a single time Sunday. He hasn\u2019t been sacked in four games, the longest stretch of his pro career.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always tough on an offensive line when you get to third-and-long and you\u2019ve got to hold the ball a little bit longer and give yourself a chance,\u201d Jaguars coach Doug Marrone said. \u201cBut when guys were open early on, they were wide open. It\u2019s tough to get to the quarterback. I think we might have hit him two or three times, but they were all on deeper third down plays.\u201d\n\nOne of those hits drew an unnecessary roughness call against Malik Jackson \u2014 after Jacksonville had called timeout. The penalty converted a third-and-3 into a first down, which helped the Colts score their final touchdown.\n\nThere was plenty of blame to go around, though.\n\nTwo plays after Jackson\u2019s 15-yard penalty, linebacker Myles Jack was called for unnecessary roughness. And when the Jags jumped offside on the ensuing extra point, Marlon Mack made the decision to go for 2 a wise choice by plunging in from 1 yard out to make it 29-13.\n\nNot enough?\n\nEbron scored on a 53-yard pass seven plays into the game and again on a 12-yard TD in the second quarter. In between those two, he scored on a 2-yard run.\n\nWhile the defense improved in the second half, the mistakes continued.\n\nJosh Lambo, who had an extra point blocked in the first half, missed a 52-yard field goal wide left before making a 55-yarder with 4:03 left to get the Jags within 29-26.\n\nAfter a defensive stop, Blake Bortles quickly got Jacksonville into field goal range and appeared to have them in perfect position when the officials ruled Rashad Green Sr. went down at the Colts\u2019 23-yard line before the ball squirted free. But just before the next snap, the replay official stopped the play, overturned the call and assured Jacksonville of another inexplicable loss.\n\nRamsey said the Jaguars were playing with a sense of desperation.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how we were feeling before the game,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean we really wanted to win out, we wanted to win every game from here on out.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "", "", "Cleveland Browns running back Nick Chubb (24) rushes for a 92-yard touchdown as Atlanta Falcons linebacker Foye Oluokun (54) misses the tackle in the second half of an NFL football game, Sunday, Nov. 11, 2018, in Cleveland.

I know we\u2019ll come back to fight.

When you don\u2019t get that done, for sure it stinks.\u201d\n\nIt was shocking considering the Falcons were coming off a well-balanced win over Washington last week and had fought their way back into contention in the NFC South.\n\n\u201cIt was disappointing,\u201d said Ryan, whose solid stats (38 of 52 for 330 yards and two touchdowns) obscured other offensive issues. \u201cObviously, you have to give credit to Cleveland. I thought they played really well and made a lot of good plays. We fell short and did not make enough plays when we needed to. We didn\u2019t play up to the standard that we are capable to playing.\n\n\u201cWe need to do that as we move forward and get ready for next week. We have got to play better.\u201d\n\nDespite their problems, the Falcons were only down 14-10 at halftime, and with their high-powered offense, a comeback seemed inevitable against the Browns (3-6-1), who had dropped four in a row.\n\nAtlanta got the ball to start the third quarter and got a 23-yard completion from Ryan to Julio Jones on the first play. After an 8-yard loss, Ryan connected on a 4-yard pass to wide receiver Mohamed Sanu, who fumbled after a hit by Browns cornerback T.J. Carrie.\n\nCleveland recovered at Atlanta\u2019s 41 and quickly drove for a touchdown as rookie QB Baker Mayfield hit Duke Johnson for an 11-yard score to give the Browns a 21-10 lead.\n\nSanu\u2019s fumble had given the momentum right back to the Browns, but while they were shaky, the Falcons still seemed OK when they pinned Cleveland at its 8 after a punt.\n\nThe worst was yet to come.\n\nOn second down, Chubb found a crease on Atlanta\u2019s right side, cut toward the sideline and outran several Falcons to the end zone on the longest rushing play in Cleveland history \u2014 and the longest by any rookie since 1949.\n\nAs Chubb raced by, Quinn, Ryan and everyone else dressed in black and red on the Atlanta sideline could only watch helplessly as any thoughts of a comeback completely vanished.\n\nQuinn didn\u2019t want to speculate on what went wrong on the play. Suffice to say, little went right.\n\nStill, the Falcons were hanging around in the fourth quarter when a series of head-scratching plays perhaps best sized up their day.\n\nAtlanta drove to Cleveland\u2019s 6 before a short pass was followed by two runs up the middle that were stopped by the Browns short of the end zone. Then, on fourth down and inches from a TD, Ryan was inexplicably in the shotgun before he threw a pass toward third-string tight end Eric Saubert, who had no chance of making a catch.\n\nRyan\u2019s choice of targets was peculiar given his other options: Jones, Sanu and tight end Alex Hooper, who caught 10 passes. Even a running play made more sense.\n\nThe hard-to-understand performance and loss overshadowed a personal milestone for Jones, who reached 10,000 career yards receiving faster than any player in NFL history.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always tough when you lose,\u201d said Jones, who had seven catches for 107 yards and one TD. \u201cWe can make up stuff here and there, but at the end of the day it\u2019s on us. I\u2019m going to keep saying that we can play better and we can do better, but with opportunities and things like that, we have to do better. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s the bottom line.

Protesters nationwide have called for the protection of special counsel Mueller's investigation into potential coordination between Russia and President Donald Trump's campaign. (Genna Martin/seattlepi.com via AP)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Matthew G. Whitaker, the nation\u2019s new acting attorney general, repeatedly chided presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in public statements during 2016 while he was speaking for a group that is barred by its tax-exempt status from supporting or opposing political candidates during a campaign.\n\nBefore coming to the Justice Department in 2017, Whitaker was president and executive of the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust, a charitable organization that styles itself as nonpartisan government watchdog promoting ethics and transparency. The tax-exempt group \u2014 known by its initials, FACT \u2014 is supposed to serve the public interest under Section 501c3 of the U.S. tax code, without directly or even indirectly supporting or opposing specific candidates for office.\n\nFACT says it has remained nonpartisan. \u201cAs a nonpartisan ethics watchdog, the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust (FACT) holds accountable government officials from both parties, as well as associated political campaigns and organizations,\u201d according to a statement provided by a FACT spokesperson.\n\nYet the group has engaged in one partisan pronouncement after another, mostly directed at Democrats. During the last presidential race, Whitaker argued in July 2016 newspaper opinion pieces that Clinton should be prosecuted for her handling of her private email server \u2014 a favorite talking point of Donald Trump. The opinion pieces identified Whitaker as FACT\u2019s leader.\n\nIn September 2016, Whitaker argued that Clinton had acted shamelessly by appointing her charity\u2019s donors to boards of the State Department when she was secretary of state.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody in the history of our country that served in the administration has been this bold in their private fundraising and their sort of giving favors,\u201d he said in a radio interview posted on YouTube by his group.\n\nDaniel Borochoff, president of CharityWatch, a Chicago-based group that monitors the nonprofit world, said that statement appears to violate the IRS ban on engagement for or against a particular political candidate. \u201cIt\u2019s highly critical of a candidate, and he ought not to be doing that, because it\u2019s a political partisan comment,\u201d he said.\n\nThe FACT statement stressed that the focus of its work on Clinton \u201cwas related to the federal investigation into her improper use of personal email and reckless handling of classified information when she was then Secretary of State.\u201d\n\nFACT has also sometimes asked for investigations of Republicans including Rep. Mark Meadows of North Carolina over an employee\u2019s severance pay, former Rep. Charles Boustany of Louisiana over alleged use of official resources for his campaign, and former Rep. Todd Akin of Missouri for an allegedly improper in-kind donation.\n\nBut the news and social media postings highlighted on the FACT website are focused overwhelmingly on challenges to Democrats and Democratic groups.\n\nWhitaker, a former U.S. attorney in Iowa, left FACT in October 2017 to become Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019 chief of staff. He was named Wednesday by Trump to take over at least temporarily for Sessions, who resigned at Trump\u2019s request.\n\nFACT was founded in 2015, tax filings show. Whitaker drew a sizable portion of its budget as his salary as president and executive director \u2014 in 2016 he earned more than twice what leaders of similar groups were paid on average that year, according to data from another watchdog group, Charity Navigator.\n\nIn 2015 and 2016, Whitaker earned a total of $654,000 from FACT \u2014 30 percent of its entire spending of $2.2 million over that two-year span. His 2016 salary was $402,000; the average CEO or executive director at 380 advocacy or education charities in that year made a salary of $173,099, according to Matthew J. Viola, a vice president at Charity Navigator.\n\nBorochoff suggested that Whitaker\u2019s board of directors at FACT didn\u2019t appear to be independent enough to apply the brakes on his campaign partisanship. Whitaker appeared to exert tight control over a three-person board of directors that included just one unsalaried member, according to the group\u2019s IRS filings in 2015-16.\n\nWhitaker\u2019s foundation was initially formed and then primarily supported with funds from another organization called Donor\u2019s Trust. That group is a nonprofit built to give conservative and libertarian philanthropists \u201cany level of privacy they want,\u201d according to its marketing materials.\n\nA FACT spokesperson declined to provide any details on donors or anyone for an on-the-record interview. There was no reply to a request for comment from Whitaker made through the Justice Department.\n\nThough 501c3 groups can legally withhold the identity of their contributors and generally do so, there may be a distinct irony when a group dedicated to transparency keeps its funding sources in the shadows.\n\nIn 2014, FACT\u2019s only source of funds was Donor\u2019s Trust, according to IRS filings. In 2015, funds from Donor\u2019s Trust accounted for all but $191 of FACT\u2019s $500,191 in revenue.

Dwayne Harris was stopped by Derwin James on a shovel pass on fourth-and-goal from the 1 to deny the best chance for Oakland.
