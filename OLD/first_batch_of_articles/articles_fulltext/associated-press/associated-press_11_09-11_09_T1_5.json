(AP Photo/Ted S. Warren)\n\nCOSTA MESA, Calif. (AP) \u2014 Desmond King is showing signs of developing into a complete player for the Los Angeles Chargers.\n\nThe second-year cornerback, who was used mainly as a blitzer last season, is being used more in man coverage while also getting some opportunities on special teams as a returner.\n\nKing has three interceptions in the Chargers\u2019 past three games. He is the AFC\u2019s defensive player of the week after returning an interception 42 yards for a touchdown in last Sunday\u2019s 25-17 win at Seattle . It is the second straight year that King has had a pick-six (he had a 90-yard interception for a TD last season at Dallas).\n\nHe is one of eight players in the conference with three picks as the Chargers (6-2) travel to Oakland on Sunday looking to extend their five-game winning streak.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have the height, the weight, the speed and all that, but if you look at Desmond he\u2019s always been a very productive player and that\u2019s not going to change when you get to the NFL. It\u2019s just a pattern of success,\u201d Chargers coach Anthony Lynn said.\n\nKing won the Jim Thorpe Award, which is given to the nation\u2019s top corner, when he was a junior at Iowa in 2015. He returned for his senior season but wasn\u2019t drafted until the fifth round last year.\n\nKing has lined up as a slot corner the past two seasons, but he has improved this year in man coverage. He said he hardly played that at Iowa due to the scheme but that it is something he worked on during the offseason.\n\n\u201cI feel like I am doing a pretty good job with that this year,\u201d King said. \u201cIt\u2019s not that much harder than transitioning from a zone team.\u201d\n\nDefensive coordinator Gus Bradley has noted that King has always been a physical player who can tackle in space, but that his comfort level with the defense has grown, which has allowed him to be more consistent.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s anticipating and he\u2019s making plays. There\u2019s a couple plays that took place (against Seattle) that it wasn\u2019t really his responsibility, but he identified it and played a pass and eliminated a big play for us,\u201d Bradley said.\n\nKing was used plenty as a blitzer last season and he had four sacks. First-round pick Derwin James is being used as a blitzer this season but Bradley said he might still use King in that role during the second half of the season.\n\nKing has also been used more on punt returns due to wide receiver Travis Benjamin being injured for most of the season. Lynn said this week that with Benjamin finally healthy, he is planning on using both players.\n\nWith last week\u2019s score, King joined Roy Williams as the only defensive backs in NFL history to have at least four sacks and two INTs for TDs their first two years. He also doesn\u2019t mind being challenged covering opposing teams\u2019 slot receivers.\n\n\u201cI feel like playing inside is harder than playing outside. A lot of people say you need size and speed to play outside but anyone can play it,\u201d King said. \u201cAs long as we are having success, have your cover guys cover and have your blitzers blitz.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\n___\n\nFollow Joe Reedy at www.twitter.com/joereedy", "BILOXI, Miss.

Turkey says Khashoggi was strangled and dismembered at the consulate in Istanbul by a 15-member assassination squad, including agents close to the prince.\n\nMembers of Congress have been calling for the administration to curtail arms sales to Saudi Arabia or take other action. And with the election handing control of the U.S. House to the Democrats, it becomes more likely that some retaliation against Saudi Arabia would gain traction on Capitol Hill.\n\nThe refueling decision, which was first reported by The Washington Post, has been under discussion for a few weeks.

He said that Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates were taking adequate measures to minimize civilian deaths.\n\nMattis has made similar remarks, saying American influence on the Arab air campaign has made a difference in reducing instances of errant bombing and the targeting of civilians.\n\nIn Friday\u2019s statement, he said, \u201cThe U.S. will also continue working with the Coalition and Yemen to minimize civilian casualties and expand urgent humanitarian efforts throughout the country.\u201d\n\nThe coalition has come under heavy criticism for its relentless airstrikes since 2015, which U.N. experts say have caused the majority of the estimated 10,000 civilian deaths in the conflict and could constitute a war crime. Several strikes in recent months have killed dozens of children.\n\nMattis in August noted that U.S. support was conditioned on a Saudi commitment to doing \u201ceverything humanly possible\u201d to avoid any loss of innocent life and Riyadh supporting a U.N.-brokered peace process to end the civil war.\n\nThe U.S. has provided the Saudis and their UAE coalition partners with intelligence, aerial refueling and military advice, but U.S. forces are not directly involved in the airstrikes or other aspects of the fighting.\n\nIn the last month, the UAE has mounted an all-out offensive to capture the critical Yemeni port of Hodeida.\n\nThe conflict has plunged Yemen into a humanitarian crisis.\n\nAccording to experts, more than 22 million people in are in desperate need in what is already the Arab world\u2019s poorest country.

(AP) \u2014 Historically, Tom Brady has been hesitant to express satisfaction when it comes to the Patriots\u2019 offense.\n\nHis approach has remained unchanged this season about a group that only recently has started to find consistency after a 1-2 start. The passing attack particularly has suffered during that time because of his lack of cohesion with a new group of receivers.\n\nBrady didn\u2019t eclipse 300 yards passing in any of New England\u2019s first three games, averaging 208 yards through the air with six total touchdowns.\n\nThings have changed during the Patriots\u2019 current six-game win streak, in which Brady has averaged 308 yards per game and thrown 11 TDs.\n\nIt\u2019s progress, Brady said, but what he hopes is only a glimpse at where they can be as the Patriots prepare for Sunday\u2019s matchup at Tennessee.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re there. Certainly not. I think we need some more time together,\u201d he said Friday. \u201cWe need to be kind of battle-tested in these games.\u201d\n\nWhile Brady credits the entire offense\u2019s dedication in the film room and its attention to detail in game plans, the acquisition of receiver Josh Gordon in Week 3 and return of Julian Edelman after missing last season with a torn right ACL have been big factors.\n\nGordon has shown a different facet of his athleticism each week. He posted his best game in a Patriots uniform in last week\u2019s win over the Packers, finishing with five catches for 130 yards and a touchdown. The score came on a 55-yard catch-and-run that gave New England some needed distance on the scoreboard in the fourth quarter. It was his second 55-yard catch this season.\n\nIn six games with New England, Gordon has 22 catches for 396 yards and two TDs.\n\nLikewise, Edelman has started to look like the go-to target Brady has depended on in recent years. He followed his first 100-yard receiving game of the season at Buffalo in Week 8 with six catches for 71 yards against Green Bay.\n\n\u201cI think his mental and physical toughness are just unmatched in a lot of ways,\u201d Brady said of Edelman. \u201cI have so much confidence in him. He really does all the dirty work for us, you know? He\u2019s so scrappy and goes in there and blocks hard, catches balls over the middle. We put him in a lot of different positions and he always seems to come through for us.\u201d\n\nIn the aftermath of his trade Gordon said he had no doubt he was going to take advantage of the opportunity with the Patriots following a tumultuous tenure with the Browns that included his receiving treatment for drug and alcohol dependence, and several suspensions.\n\nHe has flourished in New England\u2019s strict environment, which he called comfortable and \u201ca real home.\u201d He\u2019s also benefited from building a quick rapport with Brady.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great that he has a certain amount of trust in me to put it in my direction,\u201d Gordon said. \u201cAnd, I just want to come down and make a play on it.\u201d\n\nBrady said Gordon, who debuted in the Week 4 win over Miami, has exceeded expectations.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s done really everything the coaches have asked him to do.

Mauer began his career as a catcher before switching to first base. The Minneapolis Star Tribune reports that Mauer has taken out an ad in its Sunday, Nov. 11, 2018, paper to announce his retirement. (AP Photo/Jim Mone, File)\n\nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 Joe Mauer is retiring after 15 major league seasons, six All-Star games, three Gold Glove awards, three batting titles and 2,123 career hits, all with his hometown Minnesota Twins.\n\n\u201cThank you, Minnesota Twins, and thank you, fans, for making my career as special and memorable as it was,\u201d Mauer wrote in a full-page ad that will run Sunday in the Minneapolis Star Tribune and St. Paul Pioneer Press. \u201cBecause of you I can leave the game I love with a full and grateful heart.\u201d\n\nMauer\u2019s eight-year, $184 million contract expired the day after the World Series ended, creating a natural parting from the game he grew up with in St. Paul, less than 10 miles from the downtown Minneapolis ballparks he called home with the Twins.\n\n\u201cThe decision came down to my health and my family,\u201d Mauer wrote. \u201cThe risk of a concussion is always there, and I was reminded of that this season when I missed 30 games as a result of diving for a foul ball. That\u2019s all it took this time around and it was all I need to bring me back to the struggles I faced in 2013.\u201d\n\nThe first overall pick in the 2001 draft out of Cretin-Derham Hall High School, the same program that produced Hall of Famer Paul Molitor, Mauer made his debut at the Metrodome on April 5, 2004, two weeks before his 21st birthday. He signed his megadeal three weeks before the Twins began playing at Target Field.\n\nMauer acknowledged down the stretch this season he wasn\u2019t sure yet whether he was interested in continuing to play, with twin 5-year-old daughters at home and a third child on the way for him and his wife, Maddie. Then came the final game of the season on Sept. 30, when he doubled in his last at-bat and donned his catcher\u2019s gear to symbolically take one more pitch in the top of the ninth inning as he tearfully waved to the adorning crowd. Not many players could experience a farewell more poignant than that.\n\nWhat made the moment so emotional was the fact that Mauer hadn\u2019t been behind the plate since Aug. 19, 2013, when a foul tip banged off his mask and triggered a concussion that forced him to move to first base\n\n\u201cThe concussion I experienced that season not only changed my life professionally with a move to first base, but changed me personally as well,\u201d Mauer wrote.\n\nWhile his athleticism \u2014 he had a scholarship waiting for him to play quarterback at Florida State and was a sharpshooting guard on the basketball team in high school \u2014 allowed for a relatively smooth transition on defense, the effects of the head injury robbed him of his prowess at the plate for most of the next three years.\n\nAs a catcher, easily the game\u2019s most demanding and dangerous position, Mauer\u2019s offensive ability was Hall of Fame-worthy. In 2006, he became the first catcher to lead the league in batting average since 1942. He did so again in 2008 and in 2009, when he hit .365 with a .444 on-base percentage and a .587 slugging percentage to top the AL in all three categories and win the MVP award. In Mauer\u2019s last 10 games as a catcher before the concussion in 2013, he went 17 for 43 with three doubles, three homers and nine RBIs.\n\nStaying healthy became a challenge, however, and his popularity lessened some in a state usually fiercely proud of homegrown players due to the size of his contract and the amount of his absences.\n\nA knee injury limited his rookie season to 35 games, and a strained left quadriceps had him on the disabled list for more than a month in 2007. Back trouble sidelined him for all of April in 2009, when Mauer still managed to hit 28 home runs, by far his career high. In 2011, soreness and weakness in both of his legs kept him out for more than two months.\n\nMoving to first base allowed him to play more often, but between 2014 and 2016 his cumulative average was just .267 and the three highest strikeout totals of his career came in each of those seasons.\n\nHis renaissance came in 2017 as the Twins went from 59-103 to 85-77 and a spot in the AL wild card game, batting .305 with 36 doubles, the second-highest total of his career. That made it easy to see Mauer playing beyond 2018, but in the end he opted to walk away with a .306 batting average and a place in the top five on the team\u2019s career lists in a clear majority of offensive categories. Mauer is their all-time leader in doubles and times on base and second in hits behind Kirby Puckett.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "ST.

Three efficient quarters was more than enough.\n\nOgunbowale scored 30 points in 25 minutes before sitting out the fourth quarter as the top-ranked Irish opened their national title defense with a 103-58 victory over Harvard on Friday.\n\nOgunbowale, who hit two buzzer-beaters last spring at the Women\u2019s Final Four to give the Irish their second national championship under coach Muffet McGraw, made 10 of 21 field goals and all nine free throws in 25 minutes, and she\u2019s not dwelling on last season, which earned her an ESPY award and an appearance on \u201cDancing With the Stars.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be nice to see it (the national championship banner) up there, but we need to move on,\u201d Ogunbowale said.\n\nJessica Shepard had 28 points on 12-of-16 shooting to go with eight rebounds before joining Ogunbowale on the bench in the fourth quarter after playing 27 minutes. Brianna Turner, who sat out all of last season with an ACL injury, had 11 points and 11 rebounds in 21 minutes. Forward Mikayla Vaughn, another player returning from ACL surgery, finished with 12 points.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve still got a long way to go,\u201d said McGraw, who now has 801 wins as she begins her 32nd season in South Bend. \u201cI thought Jess was hard to guard inside, I think we can get the ball to Bri more and Arike got a lot of good shots off ball screens.\u201d\n\nSydney Skinner, whose 3-pointer in the first minute gave Harvard its only lead, led the Crimson (0-1) with 15 points, all from long distance. Nani Redford finished with 12 points.\n\n\u201cNotre Dame is great \u2014 they are all what they should be,\u201d Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. \u201cTheir inside players were their best players today.\u201d\n\nOgunbowale had 18 points and Shepard scored 14 as the Irish dominated the first half, leading 23-11 after the first quarter and 50-29 at halftime.\n\nNotre Dame, which shot 63 percent in the first half, ended it with Turner scoring on a pass from Jackie Young with four seconds left and Shepard stealing the inbound pass and hitting a jumper to beat the buzzer.\n\nSkinner had 12 points in the first half for Harvard, which was limited to 28.2 percent shooting, outrebounded 29-15 and committed 12 personals to Notre Dame\u2019s one.\n\nThe Irish put the game out of reach with a 36-16 third quarter to lead 86-45 going into the final 10 minutes. Their largest lead was 46 points.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nNotre Dame: The Irish started the season with three players nursing injuries. Starting point guard Marina Mabrey, the team\u2019s 3-point threat, has a quad injury, while reserve frontliner Danielle Patterson sat out with a swollen knee. Both are day-to-day. Walk-on Kaitlin Cole is out for the season after knee surgery. Starting guard Jackie Young, who played much of last year with a mask to protect a broken nose, was in a mask again after getting dinged during the team\u2019s 107-65 exhibition victory over Lewis last week. She went without it in the second half.\n\nHarvard: The Crimson finished 18-11 last season and received a berth in the WNIT for their 14th postseason appearance, the most of any Ivy League team. Harvard was picked to finish third in an Ivy League preseason poll behind first choice Princeton and Penn. Four of last year\u2019s five top scorers return, led by co-captains Skinner and Madeline Raster.\n\nSTATS\n\nThe Irish outrebounded the Crimson 55-30, had six blocks (four by Vaughn) and made 24 assists on their 37 baskets with Young and Ogunbowale having five each. For the game, Notre Dame shot 55.2 percent (37 of 67).\n\nWhat really pleased McGraw was Notre Dame\u2019s defense. The Irish held the Crimson to 29.2 percent shooting (21 of 72) though Harvard went 11 of 34 (32.4 percent) from 3-point range.\n\nOgunbowale, who guarded Skinner, did hear it from her coach.\n\n\u201cCoach told me I couldn\u2019t guard her,\u201d Ogunbowale laughed. \u201cSo I tried to step it up in the second half.\u201d\n\nUNHAPPY HOMECOMING\n\nRaster played prep basketball two miles south of the Purcell Pavilion at Saint Joseph High School. It was not a good homecoming for Raster, who was kicked in the head by Turner going for a loose ball in the third quarter. After being examined, she went to the bench and did not return. She finished with five points in 13 minutes.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s going to be fine \u2014 she\u2019s tough,\u201d Delaney-Smith said. \u201cYeah, it was pretty unfair because we needed her. But that\u2019s OK. Life isn\u2019t fair sometimes, right?\u201d\n\nT\u2019D UP AND TEED OFF\n\nDelaney-Smith, who has been Harvard\u2019s head coach for 37 seasons, finally had enough with what she thought was a disparity in the personal fouls called. So with 1:45 left to play, she let the officiating crew know about it \u2014 and received a technical.\n\n\u201cI honestly believe the imbalance in the foul calls was an atrocity,\u201d she said. \u201cAll I said to the official was \u2018home cooking.\u2019 That\u2019s ridiculous. Ironically, after I said it, we got five calls.

I want to win games, so I just kind of took that approach. Just kind of upset. But my mindset is just try to get better.\u201d\n\nThe comments were the first from McCoy since a 25-6 loss against New England on Oct. 29.

Got to play smarter. Got to play better. Simple as that,\u201d McCoy said. \u201cCan\u2019t complain or pout about it. Just got to find ways to win games and make it happen.\u201d\n\nWhat bothers him even more is that at 30 , McCoy is beginning to realize he\u2019s running out of time to achieve various objectives. They include winning a championship and establishing himself as one of the NFL\u2019s premier running backs by becoming just the 17th player to reach 12,000 career yards rushing.\n\n\u201cOh, it\u2019ll take a little longer than I expect now,\u201d said McCoy, whose 267 yards rushing this season have upped his career total to 10,359.\n\n\u201cThe urgency is up. I want to win now. I want to add on to my legacy of course, a chance to get a ring.

And he hasn\u2019t topped 100 yards since finishing with 156 on a snow-covered field in a 13-7 overtime win against Indianapolis on Dec. 10.\n\nAt the rate the Bills\u2019 anemic offense is producing in having scored an NFL-worst 96 points, McCoy wasn\u2019t making any promises when the droughts might end with Buffalo preparing to play at the New York Jets on Sunday.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have the answers, why and when, but I just look forward to getting there,\u201d he said. \u201cJust got to find a way to do it.\u201d\n\nMcCoy didn\u2019t want his frustrations to be interpreted as him being unhappy to still be in Buffalo after the NFL\u2019s trading deadline passed on Oct. 30. And he\u2019s pleased to hear general manager Brandon Beane say McCoy remains in the team\u2019s plans through the final year of his contract next season.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been good to me.

Proposition 2 legalizes the medical use of marijuana for individuals with qualifying medical illnesses. (Kristin Murphy/The Deseret News via AP)\n\nSALT LAKE CITY (AP) \u2014 Voters in conservative Utah have decided to join the growing number of states legalizing medical marijuana and expanding Medicaid to cover tens of thousands more low-income residents, two issues that had long stalled out with conservative state lawmakers.\n\nUtah will be on the list of more than 30 states allowing patients legal access to medical marijuana after the plan maintained a vote lead in in Friday tabulations. The measure will be revised, though, under a compromise that won the approval of influential Mormon church leaders.\n\nThe faith had opposed the ballot proposal over fears it could lead to broader use, but after months of fierce debate agreed to the deal. It will change the law by blocking marijuana edibles like cookies that might appeal to children and won\u2019t allow people to grow their own marijuana if they live too far from a dispensary.\n\nThe state Legislature is expected to meet in early December to hammer out the details of revising the newly passed law.\n\nMissouri also passed a medical marijuana initiative in this midterm election. Michigan became the first Midwestern state to legalize recreational marijuana while North Dakota voted against it.\n\nUtah\u2019s approval of medical marijuana shows the state\u2019s residents can think for themselves despite opposition from powerful groups such as the Utah Chiefs of Police Association, Utah Medical Association and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which accounts for nearly two-thirds of Utah\u2019s population, said DJ Schanz, director of the group that put the proposition on the ballot.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited that these sick and ailing patients will finally be able to find relief without being criminalized in Utah,\u201d said Schanz, director of the Utah Patients Coalition. \u201cThis a big message that Utahns are compassionate people ... that people can think and vote autonomously.\u201d\n\nWith the Medicaid vote, Utah joins two other Republican-leaning states, Idaho and Nebraska, where voters also approved expanding the program under President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a mandate from the public,\u201d said Matt Slonaker, executive director of the Utah Health Policy Project. His group supported the plan to provide health care coverage to an estimated 150,000 of the state\u2019s low-income residents.\n\nMost of those people work, but they don\u2019t have access to health insurance through their jobs, often because they are part-time, advocate RyLee Curtis said.\n\n\u201cThis has been six years in the making, so it\u2019s exciting to finally be able to tell people they can access the health care they\u2019ve been waiting so long for,\u201d she said.\n\nThe measure includes a sales tax increase that is expected to generate $90 million that will combine with $800 million in federal money to fund the expansion.\n\nState lawmakers, however, remain concerned the plan wouldn\u2019t cover the cost of the program. Incoming Utah House Speaker Brad Wilson said Friday the state already struggles to fund schools because of the state\u2019s large families, so lawmakers fear full Medicaid expansion could cut into education dollars.\n\n\u201cThe legislature has some tough decisions to make regarding which programs will receive less funding in the future,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nCurtis, though, said advocates calculated the sales-tax increase to more than cover the costs estimated by state analysts.\n\nOn both issues, advocates decided to go to the voters after years of failing to convince the GOP-dominated state Legislature to change state law.\n\nUtah lawmakers did approve a smaller expansion measure with work requirements this year. But the federal government hasn\u2019t yet accepted that plan.", "RICHMOND, Va.

(AP Photo/Eduardo Verdugo, File)\n\nCHICAGO (AP) \u2014 A former top lieutenant to Joaquin \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzman and likely witness at the Mexican drug lord\u2019s New York trial has pleaded guilty to trafficking conspiracy in Chicago, saying in a plea agreement unsealed Friday that he will cooperate with prosecutors in hopes of a reduced sentence and protection from cartel retribution for his family.\n\nThe 19-page plea deal , posted in Chicago federal court, says 43-year-old Vicente Zambada pleaded guilty to charges in a case originally filed in Washington, D.C., in 2002 and then transferred to Chicago this August. Zambada also agreed not to contest the government\u2019s seizure of $1.3 billion in ill-gotten assets in a related case brought in Chicago in 2009.\n\nJury selection for Guzman\u2019s trial in New York wrapped up this week, with opening statements set for Tuesday.\n\nZambada would know details about the inner workings of Guzman\u2019s Sinaloa Cartel few others would know. Zambada oversaw cartel logistics until his 2009 arrest and had authority to order hits; by his early 20s, Zambada, the son of another Sinaloa kingpin, Ismael Zambada, was already handling illegal shipments of drugs bound for Chicago, Los Angeles and other U.S. cities, filings say.\n\nIn an indication of how valuable his testimony could be and how dangerous taking the witness stand would be for him and his family, prosecutors said in the plea deal that they\u2019ll recommend the U.S. government provide security to him and his family. That could include permitting them to stay permanently in the United States, the agreement says.\n\nSecurity has been a concern since his extradition to Chicago in 2010 . He wasn\u2019t allowed on a rooftop recreational area at his city jail from fear a sniper could shoot him from an adjacent skyscraper.\n\nZambada appeared briefly in a Chicago courtroom Thursday to change his plea to guilty. The hearing wasn\u2019t listed on court schedules, though a Chicago Tribune reporter attended and described Zambada as appearing relaxed as he answered a judge\u2019s questions through an interpreter.\n\nHis agreement doesn\u2019t say explicitly he will testify in New York. But it does say he agrees to cooperate in providing testimony \u201cin any matter\u201d and \u201cin any investigation.\u201d He faces anywhere from 10 years to life in prison, but prosecutors would recommend a sentence at the low range of guidelines if Zambada cooperates as promised.\n\nThe judge set a Feb. 27 sentencing date, though that would likely be delayed as Zambada continues to aid prosecutors.\n\nThe U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Chicago declined any comment.\n\nZambada pleaded guilty under a similar arrangement in the Chicago case in 2013, in what was the first indication he\u2019d turned on his former Sinaloa cohorts.\n\nThe Chicago indictment, which names Guzman as a co-defendant, says the cartel used speed boats and submarines to transport drugs. The cartel sent 747-cargo planes full of clothes on supposed humanitarian missions to South America, returning with 13 tons of cocaine.\n\n___\n\nFollow Michael Tarm on Twitter at https://twitter.com/mtarm", "Paramount Ranch, where a number of Hollywood westerns have been filmed, is seen after it was decimated by a wildfire Friday, Nov. 9, 2018, in Augura Hills, Calif.

She sobbed during a court appearance in Chippewa County, where she was led away in handcuffs and a restraint.\n\nA deeper look at the new case and the issues raised:\n\nTRIED IN ADULT COURT\n\nThe age at which children get moved to adult court varies by state and can be discretionary in some cases.\n\nWisconsin is an outlier in that state law requires homicide or attempted homicide charges to be initially filed in adult court if the suspect is at least 10 years old, according to Marcy Mistrett, chief executive at the Campaign for Youth Justice.\n\nWisconsin is among 28 states that allow juveniles to be automatically tried in adult court for certain crimes, including murder. For most states, the age at which that is triggered is 15 or 16 years old \u2014 while some states have decided 10 is even too young for a child to be held responsible in the juvenile justice system, Mistrett said.\n\nMoving a case to juvenile court depends on establishing certain factors, such as whether the child would get needed services in the adult system, said Eric Nelson, a defense attorney who practices in Wisconsin.\n\nFor example, prosecutors in an attempted murder case involving a 12-year-old schizophrenic girl who stabbed a classmate said she belonged in adult court, where she could be monitored for years for a disease that isn\u2019t curable. Defense attorneys unsuccessfully argued against those claims.\n\nRARE CASES\n\nHomicide cases involving 10-year-old defendants are extremely rare. From 2007 through 2016, 44 children aged 10 or younger were believed to be responsible for homicides in the U.S., according to data compiled by Northeastern University criminologist James Alan Fox. Only seven of those children were girls.\n\nIn 2003, two 12-year-old boys fatally beat and stabbed 13-year-old Craig Sorger after they invited him to play in Washington state. Evan Savoie and Jake Eakin ultimately pleaded guilty in adult court and were sentenced to 20 years and 14 years in prison, respectively.\n\nIn a case where the victim survived, two 12-year-old Wisconsin girls were accused of repeatedly stabbing their classmate and leaving her for dead in 2014, saying they were trying to appease the fictional horror character Slender Man. After efforts to move their cases to juvenile court failed, Morgan Geyser and Anissa Weier pleaded guilty in adult court and were committed to mental health institutions for terms of 40 and 25 years, respectively. Geyser is appealing.\n\nTHE DEVELOPING BRAIN\n\nLaurence Steinberg, a professor of psychology at Temple University, researches the implications of brain development and how young people are treated under the law. He said it was absurd to charge the 10-year-old Wisconsin girl in adult court.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be very surprised if this went anywhere because, first of all, she just doesn\u2019t have the intellectual or emotional capacity to be an adult,\u201d he said. \u201cI doubt that she would even be competent to stand trial, and I certainly would hope that her defense attorneys would demand to do a competency evaluation.\u201d\n\nAt 10, the girl\u2019s maturity would be significantly less than even the 13- and 14-year-olds whose maturity courts are questioning more frequently, Steinberg said.\n\nFox, the Northeastern criminologist, added: \u201cThey may dress like adults, act like adults, talk like adults, even kill like adults, but they think like children \u2014 and it\u2019s illogical that a 10-year-old should have the same responsibility as an adult.\u201d\n\nHe said children often commit crimes without considering the consequences to themselves or their victims.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we have a two-part system \u2014 because kids are different.\u201d\n\nDETAILS OF THE WISCONSIN CASE\n\nAuthorities say the girl was removed from her biological parents\u2019 care in September and was in foster care at the home where the baby was injured. The home also operated as Amber\u2019s Pals and Playmates Child Care.\n\nOperator Amber Sweeney told authorities that at the time of the baby\u2019s injury, she was the only adult at the home with two 2-year-olds, two 6-year-olds, the 10-year-old and the baby.\n\nSweeney said she put the baby down for a nap around 3 p.m., and the three older children arrived by school bus about 40 minutes later. She went outside with all of the children except the sleeping infant.\n\nShe told investigators she instructed the children to stay outside because the baby was sleeping, but she saw the 10-year-old girl sitting inside the house by a bay window. At about 3:40 p.m., authorities got an emergency call, saying a baby was bleeding from the face.\n\nSweeney, a licensed foster parent in Chippewa County, has surrendered her day-care license and voluntarily closed her operation amid an investigation by Wisconsin\u2019s Department of Children and Families. She has been licensed to provide day care since 2002. A phone connected to her name was not accepting messages Friday.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear why the 10-year-old girl was in foster care. A message left with her attorney wasn\u2019t returned to The Associated Press. Her biological parents, whose names haven\u2019t been released, were with her in court.\n\n__\n\nFollow Amy Forliti on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/amyforliti", "", "FILE - In this March 17, 2018, file photo, Penn State's Bo Nickel celebrates with the trophy after Penn State won the NCAA Division I Wrestling Championships in Cleveland.

Lee, one of four All-Americans back for the third-ranked Hawkeyes, has the look of a potential four-time NCAA champion \u2014 and no one would be shocked if Lee made the U.S. Olympic team and competed for a medal in Tokyo in 2020.\n\n\u201cHe scores a lot of points. That\u2019s what we want,\u201d Iowa coach Tom Brands said of Lee. \u201cYou talk about what kind of influence does he have? Well, he inspires guys to wrestle like Spencer Lee, be like Lee, score a lot of points.\u201d\n\nTHE COWBOYS\n\nIt\u2019s never a good idea to count out John Smith, who won six world titles as an athlete before leading Oklahoma State to five national titles.

Green Bay hosts the Miami Dolphins on Sunday.\n\nThis is quite the impression that Valdes-Scantling has left the last few weeks, with breakaway speed and a 6-foot-4 frame that allow him to snare jump balls.\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing is just him gaining the trust of (quarterback Aaron Rodgers) as fast as he has,\u201d veteran wideout Randall Cobb said. \u201cIt\u2019s really impressive that Aaron wants to come to him in certain situations. He\u2019s making those plays for him.\u201d\n\nTo the tune of 17 catches for 358 yards and two scores so far for Valdes-Scantling, plus a team-high 21.1 yards per catch. He has touchdown catches in two of his last four games, with 100 yards receiving in each of the other two games during that span.\n\nThe production increase is in part due to helping fill in for Allison and Cobb while each player missed a few games with hamstring injuries. Cobb is questionable again for the Dolphins game because of hamstring trouble.\n\nThat leaves more opportunities for Valdes-Scantling to be the second receiver behind Davante Adams.\n\nThe process of gaining Rodgers\u2019 trust, though, isn\u2019t easy.

It just happens over time.\u201d\n\nProof of the payoff came late in the third quarter of last week\u2019s loss at New England, with the game tied at 17. Deep in Packers territory, Rodgers rolled right, where he quickly found two defenders trying to close in on him for a sack.\n\nThe two-time NFL MVP threw a high pass that traveled about 30 yards to Valdes-Scantling at around the 36. The rookie adjusted near the sideline to the throw while on the run. With a defender a couple steps behind him, Valdes-Scantling turned and jumped high for the catch .\n\nHe\u2019s the breakout contributor of the three receivers taken by the Packers in the draft.\n\nFourth-rounder J\u2019Mon Moore has just one catch for 10 yards. Sixth-rounder Equanimeous St. Brown has seven catches for 143 yards, and moves up in the depth chart behind Valdes-Scantling.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, (Valdes-Scantling) has been given some opportunities, probably more than we all anticipated due to the injury, and he\u2019s just delivered,\u201d coach Mike McCarthy said. \u201cSo you can see with the success and the production he\u2019s had, his confidence grows more and more each week.\u201d\n\nNOTES: RT Bryan Bulaga (knee) and LB Blake Martinez (ankle) are also questionable for Sunday.

State law allows candidates to have a nickname printed on the ballot, but only if they submit an affidavit under oath attesting it is their real nickname and they are not using it to \u201cgain an advantage on the ballot.\u201d\n\nNett was in the news earlier this year for sending a threatening tweet to a Democratic congressman.\n\nNett\u2019s affidavit, which was signed by seven other people, says he was such an enthusiastic early supporter of Trump\u2019s presidential campaign that \u201cestablishment Republicans\u201d began calling him \u201cTrump\u201d derisively.

Trump even won Elliott County in eastern Kentucky, which until then had never voted for a Republican presidential candidate since its founding in 1869.\n\nTrump remains popular in the state. Most recently, he stumped for U.S. Rep.

In May, the Lexington Herald-Leader reported Jason \u201cBooger\u201d Jude ran for jailer in Martin County, while Donald \u201cDuck\u201d Moore ran for re-election as the Jackson County clerk. Some candidates don\u2019t take any chances and legally change their names. In the 1980s, an accountant running for state treasurer changed his name to \u201cRobert Mead, C.P.A.\u201d He won. A few years later, a physician changed his name to \u201cDr. Floyd Poore\u201d in his run for governor. He lost.\n\nNett is running for Secretary of State in 2019. The office is currently held by Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes, who cannot seek re-election because of term limits.\n\nNett says he worked for the U.S. Secret Service in the 2000s. But in March, he was in the news for sending a tweet suggesting he wanted to shoot U.S. Rep. John Yarmuth. Yarmuth had posted a photo of himself on Twitter wearing the letter \u201cF\u2033 as a lapel pin to boast about the failing grade the NRA had given him. Nett then retweeted that post with the comment: \u201cMove it over just a bit. I was trained center mass.\u201d\n\nNett later apologized.

(AP Photo/Keith Srakocic)\n\nPITTSBURGH (AP) \u2014 Ben Roethlisberger was still in the process of picking himself up off the Heinz Field turf when the scrum started, one that sent a message that at the moment it might be unwise to mess with the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nSteelers center Maurkice Pouncey and right guard David DeCastro were not particularly pleased with how Carolina safety Eric Reid launched himself at Pittsburgh\u2019s franchise quarterback as Roethlisberger finished off an 18-yard scramble during the third quarter of a 52-21 dismantling of the Panthers on Thursday night.\n\nTogether the two perennial Pro Bowlers \u2014 a combined 630 pounds give or take a meal \u2014 let Reid and a handful of his teammates know they didn\u2019t appreciate Reid\u2019s approach to his job. What followed was 30 seconds of flexing, grabbing and shoving before Reid was ejected for targeting.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be there for your guy,\u201d DeCastro said. \u201cJust trying to stand up for him and show him we\u2019ve got his back.\u201d\n\nAs the Steelers made their way back to the huddle, Roethlisberger gave his linemen peace of mind should the NFL decide to hit their wallets after sticking up for him.\n\n\u201cBen came up after and said, \u2018If any fine gets handed out, I\u2019ll handle that,\u2019\u201d Pouncey said with a laugh.\n\nPouncey, in the fourth year of a five-year contract that will pay him $44 million, can certainly afford to write the check. He believes the fact he won\u2019t have to if it comes to that says a lot about Roethlisberger \u2014 and a lot about the current climate within the Pittsburgh locker room.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s cool man,\u201d Pouncey said. \u201cI appreciate all the guys repping like that.\u201d\n\nThose guys have found their identity over the last five weeks. Pittsburgh (6-2-1) set a record for the most points by an NFL team in the 17-year history of Heinz Field while rolling to a fifth straight victory. The reward? Five days off to rest up before starting a daunting final stretch that begins on Nov. 18 in Jacksonville in a playoff rematch that saw the Jaguars stun Pittsburgh at home in January.\n\n\u201cLast year is last year,\u201d Steelers cornerback Mike Hilton said. \u201cWe\u2019re a different team just like they\u2019re a different team.\u201d\n\nIf anything, Pittsburgh looks much better than while getting pushed around by Leonard Fournette and Blake Bortles in a confidence-shaking 45-42 setback that led to an exodus in both the secondary and portions of the coaching staff.\n\nRandy Fichtner took over for Todd Haley as offensive coordinator and, even with star running back Le\u2019Veon Bell sitting out due to concerns with his one-year contract, has put together an attack that looks as dynamic and varied as anything in the league.\n\nJames Conner, Bell\u2019s replacement, already has 11 touchdowns through nine games, as many as Bell has scored in any full season. Roethlisberger spread the ball all over the place on a night he finished with more scoring passes (five) than incompletions (three).\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of weapons on this team and Ben showed it tonight getting the ball to all of them,\u201d DeCastro said.\n\nRoethlisberger\u2019s only complaint is that Fichtner may get a little too loud in the headset because he\u2019s so pumped up about the next play call.\n\nPittsburgh\u2019s defense kept Carolina\u2019s Cam Newton under wraps, sacking him five times while limiting the Panthers to 242 yards, the fourth straight game an opponent has finished with 275 yards or less. Save for a couple of early communication breakdowns that allowed Panthers running back Christian McCaffrey to get loose, the Steelers kept things tight.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a come-to-Jesus moment where something miraculously just happened,\u201d defensive tackle Cam Heyward said. \u201cI think everybody got back to work. It showed on the practice field and it showed ever since. This is a big win, but it\u2019s not like we don\u2019t have games after this.

Harry caught nine passes for 161 yards and those three TDs.

Senior transfer Wilton Speight is the other option. Thompson-Robinson returned to practice this week. Kelly said Thompson-Robinson is medically cleared to play but wouldn\u2019t say who would start.\n\nSpeight completed 12 of 25 for 147 yards and a touchdown against Oregon. Thompson-Robinson was just 9-of-23 for 135 yards and a TD, with one interception, before leaving the game.\n\nBENJAMIN RUNS: Expect to see a lot of Benjamin against the Bruins, who rank 107th in the nation in rushing defense. Two games ago, Utah\u2019s Zack Moss rushed for 211 yards and three touchdowns in the Utes\u2019 41-10 win at UCLA.\n\nBenjamin, meanwhile, has rushed for 1,113 yards this season, with three games to go.

I know when I walk out of that tunnel for the last time it\u2019s going to be hard to comprehend it.\u201d\n\nBRUINS OFFENSE: As one-sided as the score was, UCLA did outgain Oregon 496 yards to 492. The difference was three turnovers \u2014 one interception and two lost fumbles.\n\nThe Bruins\u2019 Joshua Kelley rushed for 161 yards and a touchdown in 26 carries.\n\n\u201cThis is a good football team,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cThey can move the ball.

(AP Photo/Natacha Pisarenko)\n\nBUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) \u2014 Gonzalo Raffo is a die-hard Boca Juniors fan. His wife, Delfina Foramitti, passionately roots for River Plate.\n\nThey watch every soccer game together wearing the colors of the clubs that are known for holding one of the most intense rivalries in the world. Sometimes they bet: whoever loses must do all the house chores. The winner gets to relax. They also taunt each other. Sometimes, the trash-talk gets so heated at home that they\u2019ll end up in an argument. But the stakes are higher than ever now.\n\nIt\u2019s the first time that Argentina\u2019s two biggest teams will meet in the final of the Copa Libertadores, South America\u2019s equivalent of the Champions League. Like many Argentines, the married couple agrees that the final is nothing but historic. But they also fear that these two clubs that divide a nation could also divide their own family.\n\n\u201cThis is more intense than the World Cup,\u201d Foramitti said, sitting next to her husband on the white couch where they religiously follow the games on TV.\n\n\u201cOf course I\u2019m nervous because I\u2019m a huge fan of River, but I\u2019m more worried about him because the dishes will fly in this house (if Boca loses) and I can\u2019t take his bad mood.\u201d\n\nRaffo chimed in: \u201cAs long as Boca wins, nothing\u2019s going to happen!\u201d he said, laughing.\n\nThink Red Sox vs. Yankees, Celtics vs. Lakers and Barcelona vs. Real Madrid all rolled into one, and you still might not be doing it justice.\n\n\u201cThink of the two biggest teams playing in the Super Bowl and it would still be half of this. Argentines are mad about soccer and these are the two greatest clubs of Argentina,\u201d Raffo said.\n\nThe couple felt silent, and then reflected: \u201cIt will be a new country the day after,\u201d he said, solemnly. \u201cI\u2019d say this could destroy families. Divorce is on the line,\u201d she said, half-jokingly.\n\nThe first leg will be played Saturday at Boca\u2019s home stadium, an intimidating ground known as \u201cLa Bombonera\u201d \u2014 \u201cThe Chocolate Box\u201d \u2014 for its tightly enclosed shape that looks like boxes stacked on top of each other. The second leg will be on Nov. 24 at River\u2019s Monumental de Nunez Stadium, where Argentina won its first World Cup in 1978.\n\n\u201cEvery Boca-River game is important but this is truly the game of the century,\u201d said 70-year-old Carlos Zinola, who has owned the Don Carlos restaurant in front of Boca\u2019s stadium for nearly 50 years and who has attended countless derbies. \u201cIt\u2019s the eternal glory for the winner or the clamorous failure for the loser.\u201d\n\nVisiting fans will not be allowed at either match because of the fear of violence. It\u2019s been that way since 2013 and not even a plea from Argentine President Mauricio Macri, a former Boca president, could change it. But that has not kept Macri from giving his views as a Boca fan. He said it will take \u201c20 years\u201d to recover from a defeat, and he even heated up the game when he recently called River coach Marcelo Gallardo by a vulgar term.\n\nThe rivalry is everywhere: A couple named their newborn Enzo \u201cRiver Plate\u201d Bejarano. Cardiologists warned against a game that could be too dangerous for the faint of heart. A man reportedly said he was ready to postpone his marriage because it coincided with the game.

Earthjustice and other environmental groups claim President Donald Trump exceeded his authority when he reversed a ban on offshore drilling in vast parts of the Arctic Ocean and in dozens of underwater canyons in the Atlantic Ocean. (AP Photo/Mark Thiessen)\n\nANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump exceeded his power when he signed an executive order reversing a ban on offshore drilling in vast parts of the Arctic Ocean and dozens of underwater canyons in the Atlantic Ocean, an attorney argued in federal court on Friday.\n\nErik Grafe, an Alaska-based attorney for the environmental group Earthjustice, said Trump acted without the authority of Congress or the Constitution when he reversed President Barack Obama\u2019s drilling ban.\n\nGrafe, the lead attorney in a lawsuit backed by nearly a dozen environmental groups, contends the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act only allows presidents to remove lands under consideration for development, not add them back in. Only Congress has that authority, he said.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump has attempted unilaterally to undo protections that President Obama put in place. And our argument is that that action is unlawful because he lacks constitutional authority and he lacks authority from Congress,\u201d Grafe told reporters outside the courtroom in U.S. District Court in Anchorage.\n\nActing Assistant U.S. Attorney General Jeffrey Wood countered that Grafe and others were misinterpreting the intent of the law, written in 1953. He said it is meant to be flexible and sensible and not intended to bind one president with decisions made by the previous one when determining offshore stewardship as needs and realities change over time.\n\nHe said the plaintiffs were \u201csimply wrong.\u201d The U.S. Department of Justice declined to make Wood available for comment following the hearing.\n\nIn the government\u2019s response to the lawsuit, it said only allowing presidents to take land out of consideration for development \u201cis one-way ratchet that broadly authorizes any one President to limit the national potential for leasing, exploration, and development in the OCS for all time while simultaneously tying the hands of that same President and all future presidents, even if those limits prove unwise or contrary to the critical national priorities that OCSLA advances, including energy development and national security.\u201d\n\nThe drilling ban was a key part of former Obama\u2019s environmental legacy. The ban was intended to protect polar bears, walrus, ice seals and Alaska Native villages that depend on the animals.\n\nIn 2015, Obama halted exploration in coastal areas of the Beaufort and Chukchi seas and the Hanna Shoal, an important area for walrus. In late December 2016, he withdrew most other potential Arctic Ocean lease areas \u2014 about 98 percent of the Arctic outer continental shelf.\n\nIn the Atlantic, Obama banned exploration in 5,937 square miles (15,377 square kilometers) of underwater canyon complexes, citing their importance for marine mammals, deep-water corals, valuable fish populations and migratory whales, according to the lawsuit.\n\nTrump reversed the bans in April 2017.\n\nU.S. District Judge Sharon Gleason took the case under advisement and didn\u2019t indicate when she might rule. A lease sale tentatively planned next year in the Beaufort Sea off Alaska\u2019s north coast could be affected if she rules for the environmental groups.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show Wood\u2019s title as acting assistant attorney general.", "Terwilliger formally installed as US attorney in Virginia\n\nALEXANDRIA, Va.

(AP) \u2014 Call Odell Beckham Jr. the eternal optimist.\n\nWhen the New York Giants\u2019 flashy wide receiver was asked Friday what he hoped his 1-7 team would do for the remainder of the season, Beckham didn\u2019t pull any punches.\n\n\u201cI think the goal is to win eight games, go 9-7 and go to the playoffs,\u201d Beckham said.\n\nEven though no NFL team has ever pulled off such a comeback?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an easy task,\u201d Beckham added. \u201cBut that\u2019s the goal. We want to win every game and I want to do everything I can to help that. The Giants have been there before, gone 9-7 and got into the playoffs. Anything is possible. It\u2019s not impossible to win eight games. It wasn\u2019t impossible to lose seven. Anything can happen.\u201d\n\nBeckham remained upbeat as his team prepared to face the San Francisco 49ers in Santa Clara, California on Monday night. He was certain his team is ready to turn it around, albeit in miraculous fashion \u2014 provided the Giants do a better job of scoring touchdowns.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve lost a lot of close games that we just didn\u2019t pull through,\u201d Beckham said. \u201cWe know what situations we\u2019re in when we are in those close games. We just haven\u2019t found a way to pull them through. It\u2019s easy to sit up here and be like we want to win eight games knowing that it\u2019s very tough to do. You just got to pull it all together now.\n\n\u201cI know we\u2019re not in a very good situation, but you just got to make the most out of that.\u201d\n\nBeckham signed a five-year, $95 million contract, with approximately $65 million guaranteed, during training camp in August, so he\u2019s the new face of the franchise moving forward. He was asked if he felt he had any pressure to be the one who kick-starts the offense.\n\n\u201cNot any more than I ever have,\u201d said Beckham, who has caught 61 passes for 785 yards and two touchdowns this season. \u201cHopefully I can start catching some of these things and start taking them to the crib, making bigger plays. I put more on myself. Whatever happens is what\u2019s going to happen, but I know that my mentality is not going to be to quit. I\u2019m not going to be out there not trying to go hard every play. Any chance that I get, that\u2019s just always how I\u2019m going to be.\u201d\n\nBeckham was also asked if the Giants could eliminate some problems in scoring touchdowns once they get inside the opponent\u2019s 20-yard line.\n\n\u201cI think that any chance I get, and all of us get a chance to take something to the house, it\u2019s time to go,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no more holding back, playing it safe, or waiting for the next play, because you don\u2019t know if you\u2019re going to have a next play, and that\u2019s just the mentality we have to take. Any chance I get now, and I catch one of these slants, there\u2019s no motion wasted. It\u2019s just got to be somebody has got to come catch me. You trust your training, you trust your speed \u2014 somebody has got to come catch me. I\u2019m trying as much as I can to make these plays, explosive plays, and we all need to do that.\u201d\n\nFellow wideout Sterling Shepard also recognizes his team\u2019s struggles in the red zone.\n\n\u201cExplosive plays are always good themselves, but if you can take them all the way, then that obviously is better for the team,\u201d said Shepard, who has 40 receptions for 542 yards and two touchdowns. \u201cYou just take them as they come and some of them will pop, some of them won\u2019t, but an explosive play all around is good for the team. I think it\u2019s we\u2019re just not being assignment sound. I feel like one guy is always off or two guys off when we get into the red zone, and that can kill your chances of scoring.\u201d\n\nBeckham Jr. is befuddled why the Giants aren\u2019t scoring more.\n\n\u201cNot to say that the opportunities haven\u2019t been there, but they\u2019ve been limited,\u201d he noted.\n\nBut Beckham feels the tide is about to turn for him personally.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, but towards the back end of the season, I feel like I do better,\u201d Beckham said. \u201cAs the season goes on, people\u2019s bodies start to break down. I really try to maintain and I really try to be better than I was in Week 1 or Week 10. I feel a lot stronger going in towards the back end of the season. I feel like I\u2019m in the best shape of my life. Now, it\u2019s just time to do that.\u201d\n\nNOTES: Coming off a bye, the Giants had a full team at practice Friday.

Randolph of Hattiesburg is in line to become the next chief justice. Randolph has been on the nine-member Supreme Court since April 2004 and is second in seniority to Waller.\n\nGov. Phil Bryant will appoint a new justice in Waller\u2019s central Mississippi district, and that person will serve the final three years of an eight-year term. The position is up for election in November 2020 for a term that begins more than a year later, in January 2022.\n\nAfter retirement, Waller plans to work as a senior status judge, meaning he will occasionally hear cases. He said he also would like to teach at the two in-state law schools at the University of Mississippi and Mississippi College, the news release said.\n\nAs chief justice, Waller oversaw expansion of drug courts to all 22 of the state\u2019s circuit court districts. The courts focus on helping people achieve and maintain sobriety. When the last state budget year ended in June, 3,283 people were taking part in felony drug court programs, which are also promoted as a way to keep people out of prison and save the state money on incarceration costs.\n\nWaller also oversaw the adoption of an electronic filing system for Mississippi courts. The system is used in 58 counties in chancery courts and 23 counties in circuit courts. It is also used in 11 county courts.\n\nWaller earned his law degree from the University of Mississippi in 1977 and was in private practice in the Waller and Waller law firm in Jackson from that year until 1998. He was a Jackson municipal judge from January 1995 until July 1996.\n\nWaller is a graduate of the U.S. Army War College and served 30 years in the Mississippi Army National Guard, attaining the rank of brigadier general.

And in July Trump yanked credentials from another CNN reporter \u2014 Kaitlan Collins \u2014 after she asked Trump a question about an audio recording with his former attorney, Michael Cohen, about a payoff to a Playboy model.\n\nTrump has also called for violence against detractors and adopted rhetoric from Joseph Stalin when declaring the United States media as the \u201cenemy of the people.\u201d His attacks against the press are constant and deeply disturbing.\n\nJustin Silverman, of the New England First Amendment Coalition, called Trump\u2019s latest move unconstitutional; threatening to journalists; and an infringement on the public\u2019s right to know.

This type of retaliation is an affront to the First Amendment and unbefitting of any democratic institution, especially the White House.\u201d\n\nSilverman explains these types of retaliatory acts, intended to punish reporters for holding government to account, \u201csets a dangerous precedent for reporters covering state and local government.\u201d\n\nWe couldn\u2019t agree more. Of all Trump\u2019s chilling rhetoric, little is scarier than his open derision of a free press.

The upper ozone above the Northern Hemisphere should be repaired by 2030, scientists reported Monday at a meeting in Ecuador. A hole over the Southern Hemisphere is closing more slowly and is expected to be covered by 2060.\n\nAlthough it isn\u2019t time to declare victory (the use of some banned chemicals is rising in Asia), the ozone improvement shows the path the world must take to avert the current environmental disaster \u2014 climate change. That path includes heeding warnings from scientists, understanding \u2014 not downplaying \u2014 the risks and, most important, taking action.\n\nScientists discovered that the ozone layer, gases high up in the atmosphere that protect the Earth from ultraviolet rays, was thinning in the 1970s. The ozone hole was caused by the use of chlorofluorocarbons, which were used as refrigerants in air conditioners and in aerosol spray cans.\n\nThe public concern was fueled by worries about skin cancer and crop damage, among other problems, that could come from a thinned or depleted ozone layer.\n\nLeaders from countries around the world came together to reach an agreement to phase out CFCs. In 1987, the Montreal Protocol was signed. Despite uncertainties around the science, which were exploited by industry to derail regulations, Republican President Ronald Reagan signed the agreement, calling it \u201ca model of cooperation\u201d and \u201ca product of the recognition and international consensus that ozone depletion is a global problem.\u201d\n\nAnother benefit of the Montreal Protocol, although it wasn\u2019t clear at the time, was to slow climate change. CFC are powerful greenhouse gases that trap heat in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Phasing out their use delayed the current consequences of climate change, perhaps by decades.\n\nThirty years later, there is international consensus that climate change is a global problem. Nearly every country in the world has signed on to the Paris climate accord, an international agreement to lower emissions of greenhouse gases, which trap heat in the atmosphere. President Donald Trump has pledged to pull the U.S. from the agreement. He has argued that climate change is a hoax by the Chinese to harm U.S. businesses. He is abetted by climate deniers in Congress and industry-funded efforts to create doubt about climate change and fears that the U.S. economy will be harmed if the U.S. takes significant action to cut greenhouse gas emissions. Despite this rhetoric, many U.S. businesses are cutting emissions and becoming more environmentally friendly because it is good for their bottom lines.\n\nAn important lesson from the ozone lesson is that certainty isn\u2019t needed for leaders to take action, scientists say. \u201cWhen Montreal was signed, we were less certain then of the risks of CFCs than we are now of the risks of greenhouse gas emissions.\u201d Sean Davis, a climate scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said last year.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need absolute certainty to act,\u201d he said.\n\nWhat is clear is that action is needed. Last month, the U.N. warned that humans have only 12 years to make dramatic reductions in greenhouse gas emissions before it is too late to slow the trend of warmer temperatures, rising sea levels, raging wildfires and widespread droughts. The calculus is simple \u2014 we can pay now in the form of investments in cleaner technologies and fuels \u2014 or pay later in deaths, upheaval and violence.\n\nThe focus on the ozone hole shows that when action is demanded and countries work together, climate disasters can be avoided. It is past time to take that lesson to heart when it comes to climate change.\n\nOnline: https://bit.ly/2RJQws0\n\n___\n\nMASSACHUSETTS\n\nCape Cod Times\n\nNov. 8\n\nYarmouth recently took a giant step toward becoming a green community, a process that began nearly eight years ago. The designation, which carries with it the weight of environmentally friendly approaches throughout the town, also opens the door to potential grants and funding mechanisms, as well as the knowledge that the town is doing its level best to act as a good steward of the environment.\n\nIt\u2019s not easy being green. A community seeking the state\u2019s green community status must make a firm commitment to adopting environmentally friendly approaches to its governance, as outlined in five criteria it must meet. These include crafting zoning for facilities that either generate power from renewable or alternative energy sources, or that research, develop, or manufacture such capabilities. Towns must also create an accelerated application and permitting process for locating facilities within this zone.\n\nIn addition, the community must inventory its energy usage and then adopt a plan to reduce that same usage by 20 percent during a five-year period. The municipality must also create a fuel-efficient vehicle policy that mandates that all town departments purchase such vehicles moving forward. A handful of town-owned vehicles - including police, fire, and highway department vehicles - are exempt. Finally, the town must adopt so-called Stretch Code building regulations, which are designed to reduce the operating costs and energy usage of new homes and buildings.\n\nYarmouth is nearing the end of its application process, and if successful, it will join more than 200 towns throughout the commonwealth that have already earned the green community designation, including four on Cape Cod and two on Martha\u2019s Vineyard. Other towns on the Cape, including Falmouth, are also moving in this direction.\n\nNot everyone, however, is thrilled with the idea of becoming a green community. Some have argued that the regulations associated with the Stretch Code hamper development; that towns that adopt the stricter standards are passing additional construction expenses on to homeowners. And in truth, the cost to build a more energy-efficient house, or purchase a more energy-efficient vehicle, very likely will be more pricey in the short term, but a long view that includes the lifetime energy usage associated with that building or vehicle demonstrates real cost savings year after year.\n\nSimilarly, towns like Yarmouth that commit to reducing energy usage by 20 percent over five years may find themselves with capital expenses that initially seem high. Think back to a couple of years ago when one could purchase an incandescent light bulb for about a dollar, while LED bulbs were retailing for upwards of $10 each. But the long-term savings - both in terms of durability and lower energy consumption - made LED bulbs the logical choice in the long term. Towns that strive toward achieving green community status will likewise reap the benefits of lower energy bills on an annual basis for years to come.\n\nIn the end, a green community designation is about looking at that long term, because it is only through the concerted efforts of individuals and communities that we will stand any chance of reducing our overall carbon footprint on this planet, helping to ensure that there is something left for our children and their children to call home.\n\nThe United States, as a nation, has historically been slow to adopt international environmental standards, and in the last couple of years, has actively stepped away from taking anything resembling a leadership role when it comes to environmental awareness or activism.\n\nFortunately, forward-thinking states, such as Massachusetts and California, have picked up the mantle and worked to implement regulations that make sense from both an environmental and economic perspective. Towns like Yarmouth that are willing to take up the green community challenge are doing their part, putting both their self interest and the interest of the planet, as a whole, at the forefront.\n\nOnline: https://bit.ly/2zBX5Fq\n\n___\n\nCONNECTICUT\n\nThe Day\n\nNov. 8\n\nTuesday\u2019s election altered the power sharing structure of the federal government. The temptation will be strong for Democrats, the new majority in the House of Representatives, to exact political revenge on President Donald Trump.\n\nThere should be scrutiny through House investigations of Trump\u2019s tax records, his investments, his creditors, and the money that foreign governments funnel into his privately-held company.\n\nBut while oversight is an important role of the legislative branch, one which the Republican-controlled House has largely abdicated, it is not the only role. Yes, those who voted to send Democrats to Congress want the president held accountable, but they also want actions taken to improve their lives. Democrats will make a huge mistake if they settle only for being the anti-Trump party. Democrats must show the country that they know how to govern better.\n\nThe 2018 election cycle was more than a counter punch to the overreach of an unfit president. The election was the first confirmation of a country on the cusp of rapid social transformation. The new House of Representatives will have more women and more ethnic diversity than ever before, reflecting demographical shifts.\n\nA new country is emerging, one where minorities, collectively, will be the majority population. The east and west coasts and the large urban areas of America are transforming into a post-industrial, high-tech, socially progressive and demographically diverse society. The Democrats recognize the changes. The Republicans, under the Trump influence, pretend it is not happening.\n\nBut it is not enough to simply recognize and celebrate diversity. What is required is a political party that can unify the diversity of the population under policies that advance the nation.\n\nA prime example is health care. The momentum for expansion of national health care insurance is building. Many Democrats campaigned on a \u201cMedicare for all\u201d update to Obamacare. That\u2019s a swell slogan, but it is not a plan of governance. Democrats should develop a health care plan that identifies both the costs and the ways those costs would be covered through taxes and/or diversions of government spending.\n\nRepublicans, with no vision for how to provide for health care needs, have left a vacuum Democrats can fill if they coalesce behind a plan. Allowing individuals 50 and older or the companies they work for to buy into Medicare may be a start. Rep. Joe Courtney, D-2nd District, is among the proponents of this idea.\n\nWith Republicans in control of the Senate there is no chance for major health care reform, but using the House to frame the debate could propel the Democrats in 2020.\n\nImmigration is another issue where Democrats need a coherent policy, devising a comprehensive, compassionate and rational approach that puts America back in the business of welcoming immigrants, fairly assessing the cases of refugees, providing the resources to secure the border and better tracking those who exceed their authorized stays.\n\nConcerning potential malfeasance by this president, his administration and his 2016 campaign, protect the Mueller investigation and let it run its course, then assess its findings. Until then, talk of impeachment is premature and unhelpful.\n\nTrump will try to paint the House Democrats as obstructionists. They should not play into his hands. This moment calls for leadership to put America back on the historic path of its noble journey to improve the lot of mankind. The challenge for Democrats is to lead the way and rise above revenge politics.\n\nThroughout America\u2019s tumultuous history the country has advanced the cause of human rights. America became a better country by ending slavery, extending voting rights to blacks and women, and welcoming tides of immigrants from all oppressed parts of the globe.\n\nEvery thrust of progress on human rights was met with resistance. Backlash from counter movements caused the county to regress a few steps before regaining forward momentum.\n\nRecent American history is rife with dramatic change from the election of Barack Obama, to the advancement of gay rights, technology advancement, global trade, the disruption of mass migrations and the growing threat of climate change.\n\nThese dramatic changes created unease and push back. That push back led the nation, unfortunately, to the election of Trump.\n\nTrump has squandered his presidency and thwarted America\u2019s forward movement by promoting divisiveness and demonizing every opponent who crosses his path.\n\nThe Trump Era is destined to be assigned a role of disgrace in the American story. The faster our politics can regain its faith in the American ideal of justice for all, the faster the nation can put the sorry aberration of Trump\u2019s presidency into the rear-view mirror.\n\nOnline: https://bit.ly/2PPxPpt\n\n___\n\nRHODE ISLAND\n\nProvidence Journal\n\nNov. 6\n\nJasiel Correia is innocent until or unless he\u2019s judged guilty in court.\n\nJasiel Correia should step down as mayor of Fall River, Mass.\n\nThese two ideas are not in conflict. Both are true.\n\nA quick recap, for those who have tuned out this cartoonish saga:\n\nLast month, the U.S. attorney for Massachusetts indicted Mr. Correia on a series of charges related to his operation of a startup digital app company called SnoOwl. The prosecutors said Mr. Correia, now 26, lied to SnoOwl investors about his bonafides in order to separate them from their money.\n\nProsecutors say \u201cseven individuals invested a total of $363,690 in SnoOwl. However, rather than using the investment funds to develop the app as Correia certified in signed agreements with investors, it is alleged that Correia used at least $231,447, approximately 64 percent of the money invested, to purchase tens of thousands of dollars of luxury items, including a Mercedes, jewelry and designer clothing; to pay for personal travel and entertainment, including tens of thousands of dollars on airfare, hotels, restaurants, casinos, and adult entertainment; to pay down personal student loan debt; to fund his political campaign; and to make charitable donations in his own name.\u201d\n\nFurther, charge the prosecutors, Mr. Correia gave false updates to investors and filed false statements with the Internal Revenue Service, avoiding paying taxes that he owed.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Correia has been playing hide-and-seek, declining even to answer questions before the City Council. On his Facebook page, he called for support: \u201cIn the event a recall petition does gain the necessary signatures, I ask that the citizens re-elect me so that our progress can continue. I ask that the people of Fall River show their support by not signing the recall petition.\u201d\n\nEarlier, he declared to a group of supporters, \u201cI will not resign.\u201d They applauded.\n\nThe charges have led a variety of leaders, from the governor of Massachusetts to U.S. Rep. Joseph Kennedy, to ask Mr. Correia to resign his seat as mayor. Said the campaign of Gov. Charlie Baker, \u201cMayor Correia should act in the best interests of the people of Fall River and step aside until the case is resolved.\u201d\n\nAs Mr. Correia awaits trial, he is required to have no contact with his investors or potential witnesses, illustrating how he has been hamstrung as a political leader. Residents have launched a recall campaign, which is in its early stages. They will need to collect 2,510 certified signatures to trigger an election.\n\nOne of the residents calling for a recall, Dawn Saurette, wrote that the mayor has been tainted by the indictments. \u201d(T)here is and should be a degree of distrust, no reasonable person would do business with the office of the mayor or the city of Fall River,\u201d she wrote.\n\nFall River, once a thriving manufacturing city, struggles with poverty, an opioid epidemic and crime. It has serious problems, requiring serious governance. It doesn\u2019t have time for a mayor who is wrestling with his own problems.\n\nFor the good of the city he was elected to govern, Mr. Correia should resign. If, as he says, he is innocent, he will be cleared and, at his tender age, stage a political comeback.\n\nAfter all, America loves second acts.\n\nOnline: https://bit.ly/2QwSBHo\n\n___", "", "Rivera tells Panthers to get away from football after loss\n\n1 of 3 Carolina Panthers running back Christian McCaffrey (22) backs into the end zone for a touchdown during the second half of the team's NFL football game against the Pittsburgh Steelers in Pittsburgh, Thursday, Nov. 8, 2018. The Steelers won 52-21. (AP Photo/Don Wright)\n\nCHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) \u2014 Panthers coach Ron Rivera wants his players to get away from football, just for a little while.\n\nA day after a humiliating 52-21 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers, Carolina\u2019s eighth-year coach said it may just be what the Panthers need.\n\n\u201cSometimes the best medicine is to forget about it and then come back ready to roll,\u201d Rivera said Friday, adding that they should focus on something other than football.\n\nThat advice doesn\u2019t apply to Rivera and his coaching staff.\n\nRivera said coaches will spend the next few days pouring over game film, looking for solutions and making adjustments, particularly on the offensive and defensive lines where the Panthers were overwhelmed by the Steelers in the road loss. The coach wouldn\u2019t say if he\u2019s considering any changes to the starting lineup.\n\nQuarterback Cam Newton was sacked five times and threw a crucial pick-six out of desperation to avoid taking a safety in the end zone, while the defense never was able to stop Ben Roethlisberger, who turned in a perfect QB rating (158.3) after throwing for 328 yards and five touchdowns. The 52 points allowed tied the most in franchise history.\n\nThe Panthers (6-3) are still in good shape in the NFC playoff picture, but Rivera expressed concern knowing the NFL is a copycat league and upcoming opponents will look to simulate what the Steelers did against them.\n\n\u201cIt is a beg, borrow and steal league,\u201d Rivera said. \u201cGuys are going to look at this tape and see what (the Steelers) did and have answers. We as coaches, as I said, are not done evaluating tape and going through it and trying to correct things.\u201d\n\nPittsburgh\u2019s defense brought more pass rushers than the Panthers were able to block, often resulting in 5-foot-11, 210-pound running back Christian McCaffrey desperately trying to pick up linemen who outweighed him by almost 100 pounds. That didn\u2019t go well.\n\nRivera said the Steelers defense threw some new looks at Carolina\u2019s revamped offensive line and the guys up front didn\u2019t recognize or adjust to them.\n\n\u201cSometimes you see things for the first time, things that they do a little differently, with a little twist to them, it makes things difficult,\u201d Rivera said. \u201cWe have to be able to handle those things.

Vonn will begin her season and her quest to become the all-time winningest ski racer in a few weeks in Lake Louise, Alberta, where she's won so many times. She's trying to enjoy the moment and not think too much about breaking Ingemar Stenmark's hallowed mark of 86 World Cup wins.(AP Photo/Marco Trovati, File)\n\nCOPPER MOUNTAIN, Colo. (AP) \u2014 On her farewell tour, Lindsey Vonn vows to dine out even more with her American teammates , have an occasional glass of wine with longtime rivals/friends and take plenty of photos.\n\nOne quick caveat, though, as she savors the sights and sounds during her last go-around: Come race day, Vonn will of course be Vonn.\n\nAt ease with her decision to retire following the season, she\u2019s ready to charge after history \u2014 balky right knee and all.\n\nThe 34-year-old ski racer enters the season with 82 World Cup victories, leaving her five away from breaking the record held by Ingemar Stenmark of Sweden.\n\n\u201cAs much as I\u2019m going to soak this season in, I\u2019m still out there to win. I\u2019m never going to be in the starting gate to just check out the scenery,\u201d said Vonn , whose season kicks off in Lake Louise, Alberta, with a pair of downhill races and a super-G beginning on Nov. 30. \u201cI\u2019m very goal-oriented. That won\u2019t be any different.\u201d\n\nShe said there\u2019s zero chance she returns even if she finishes just shy of breaking Stenmark\u2019s achievement.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t physically do it \u2014 unless something miraculously happens in science,\u201d said Vonn, who lives in Vail, Colorado. \u201cI\u2019m happy with what I\u2019ve done. No matter what happens, it\u2019s definitely going to be my last season.\u201d\n\nOnce she steps away from racing, she has other plans to keep her occupied. Like possibly opening a business, perhaps a beauty line. Or taking in more hockey games, with her boyfriend, P.K. Subban , a defenseman for the Nashville Predators . She also hasn\u2019t ruled out the possibility of a broadcasting career.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m ready for the next chapter. It\u2019s not because I want to be \u2014 I\u2019m ready because it has to be,\u201d Vonn said after a training session at the U.S. ski team\u2019s speed center at Copper Mountain. \u201cThe risk just doesn\u2019t outweigh the reward anymore. I would like to be able to ski recreationally in 10 years and if I have children, be able to ski with them. ... It came to the point where it was time to say goodbye.\u201d\n\nAs she discussed her injuries, Vonn patted her troublesome right knee. Her dog, Lucy , sat on her lap with a bandage \u2014 duct tape, actually \u2014 on her right front paw following a recent accident.\n\nOver her distinguished career, Vonn\u2019s had a long list of ailments : ACL reconstructions, fractures near her left knee joint, bruised shin, broken ankle, broken arm, sliced right thumb and countless concussions.\n\nShe joked that her relationship with skiing is \u201ctough love.\u201d\n\nStill, she said the sport helped her through some tough times, like her divorce from Thomas Vonn or her split with Tiger Woods.\n\n\u201cSkiing always helps me get over it emotionally. It\u2019s always been my escape,\u201d said Vonn, whose first World Cup start was Nov. 18, 2000, in a slalom race when she was known as Lindsey Kildow. \u201cMy injuries, while painful and difficult, still were an important lesson and taught me a lot about myself and what I\u2019m capable of.\u201d\n\nComing up through the ranks, Vonn never contemplated breaking Stenmark\u2019s record of 86. It was just too far out there.\n\nInstead, she kept her mind on Olympic medals . She earned a gold medal in the downhill and a bronze in the super-G at the 2010 Vancouver Games, along with a downhill bronze at the Pyeongchang Olympics last February. She missed the 2014 Sochi Games due to her right knee.\n\n\u201cIt was really about the Olympics,\u201d she said. \u201cThe success I\u2019ve had on the World Cup level has been so much more than I ever thought was possible.\u201d\n\nIn January 2015, Vonn broke the women\u2019s World Cup mark of 62 victories that belonged to Annemarie Moser-Proell of Austria. It was quite an accomplishment, but the queries quickly turned to this: Can Vonn catch Stenmark?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018Can we talk about breaking the women\u2019s record for one second before we move on to something else I have to do?\u2019\u201d Vonn said. \u201cI didn\u2019t really think it was possible until I hit maybe 76 (wins). Before that, it was mostly just talking to the media and dealing with everyone else\u2019s expectations. Anything could happen in ski racing and 63 wins to 86 is a really long way, so it\u2019s hard to even think that far ahead.\n\n\u201cUntil now, I haven\u2019t really focused on Stenmark\u2019s record.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s within sight.\n\n\u201cA huge story,\u201d said Norway\u2019s Aksel Lund Svindal , who has 35 World Cup wins. \u201cIt\u2019s the record in Alpine skiing that people thought was unbreakable and she\u2019s probably going to break it.\u201d\n\nFor the moment, Vonn\u2019s mission remains simple: Soak in the entire experience.\n\n\u201cInstead of always being in the hotel room and super-focused on the race the next day, I\u2019m actually going out to dinner with the team and doing something different,\u201d Vonn said. \u201cI\u2019m really enjoying it and not just having it be a job. I love the job, don\u2019t get me wrong. But there\u2019s also a level of, \u2018I need to chill a little bit.\u2019\n\n\u201cI\u2019m 34.

Democrats who gained new or expanded powers in state elections are gearing up for a left-leaning push on gun control, universal health care and legal marijuana. Meanwhile, some Republican legislatures that have cut taxes and limited union powers are adjusting to a new reality of needing to work with a Democratic governor. The midterm elections Tuesday, Nov. 6, increased Democratic relevance in state capitols that have been dominated by Republicans during the past decade. (Thad Allton/The Topeka Capital-Journal via AP, File)\n\nTOPEKA, Kan. (AP) \u2014 Democratic Gov.-elect Laura Kelly learned Friday that she stands a better chance of fulfilling a campaign promise to boost spending on Kansas\u2019 public schools without raising taxes with a new, more optimistic fiscal forecast showing it\u2019s possible in the short-term.\n\nThe state\u2019s official revenue-estimating group increased by $291 million the projection for tax collections expected during the current fiscal year, which began in July. That\u2019s 4.2 percent higher than the previous fiscal forecast made in April and brings the prediction for tax collections to $7.2 billion.\n\nThe forecasters also predicted tax collections will grow by 2.7 percent during the fiscal year that begins in July 2019, to $7.4 billion. The picture isn\u2019t completely rosy: The forecast assumes economic growth flags in 2021 and tax collections grow then by 1.6 percent, to roughly $7.5 billion.\n\nBut the Legislature\u2019s nonpartisan research staff released a budget profile showing Kansas can increase its annual spending on schools in each of the next two fiscal years after covering anticipated higher social services costs.\n\nKelly said during her campaign that she wanted to increase public school funding, and the Kansas Department of Education estimates another $90 million a year is necessary to comply with state Supreme Court mandates in an ongoing education funding lawsuit. Kelly also wants to expand the state\u2019s Medicaid health coverage as encouraged by the 2010 federal Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cThis is good news for our families and the state of Kansas,\u201d Kelly said in a statement. \u201cI will continue to work with leaders of both parties to keep our state on the road to recovery so we can invest in our schools, expand Medicaid and balance the budget without new taxes.\u201d\n\nKansas experienced persistent budget shortfalls after an experiment in cutting state income taxes in 2012-13 engineered by then-GOP Gov. Sam Brownback. Kansas became a national example of how not to do trickle-down economics, and bipartisan legislative majorities reversed most of Brownback\u2019s tax cuts in 2017. Tax collections have exceeded expectations ever since.\n\nIn the governor\u2019s race, Republican nominee Kris Kobach promised to slash taxes and shrink government spending at the same time to keep the budget balanced.\n\nDeparting Republican Gov. Jeff Colyer \u2014 who narrowly lost to Kobach in the August primary \u2014 said of the new forecast: \u201cThis also puts us in a better position to give back to Kansans by lowering taxes, funding education, and making other critical investments in our state.\u201d\n\nKelly said during a news conference Thursday that increasing school funding is her top priority, but during her campaign, she had a list of other neglected areas of the budget, including higher education, social services and mental health services.\n\nTop GOP lawmakers, frustrated by what they see as unrealistic promises, said the Republican-controlled Legislature will hold her to her promise not to raise taxes.\n\nBut Kelly may have some leeway with voters to raise new revenues.\n\nA majority of Kansas voters were at least somewhat supportive of increasing taxes to provide additional funds for public schools, according to AP VoteCast, a nationwide survey of about 139,000 voters and nonvoters. The survey, conducted for The Associated Press by NORC at the University of Chicago, included 3,963 voters and 780 nonvoters in Kansas.\n\nFifty-eight percent of voters said they strongly supported or somewhat supported raising taxes to boost education funding, and a majority of them backed Kelly. Forty-one percent strongly or somewhat opposed a tax increase, and roughly two-thirds of them backed Kobach.\n\n\u201cThat surprises me, but I don\u2019t think a tax increase to fund schools is going to be necessary,\u201d said Senate Minority Leader Anthony Hensley, a Topeka Democrat, adding that with the new forecast, Kelly has \u201ca lot of flexibility.\u201d\n\nState officials had expected a more optimistic forecast because the state\u2019s tax collections have exceeded expectations for 17 consecutive months, the longest streak since at least February 1966, according to data compiled by The Associated Press. The forecasting group is made up of legislative researchers, Department of Revenue officials and state university economists.\n\n___\n\nAlso contributing was Amanda Seitz in Chicago.\n\n___\n\nFollow John Hanna on Twitter: https://twitter.com/apjdhanna .", "SANDOWN, N.H.

Win six games? Eight games?\u2019 I\u2019d say: conference championship.\u201d\n\nA victory on Saturday night over South Florida (7-2, 3-2) would keep them in contention.

The Bulls haven\u2019t kicked off a game in temperatures below 40 degrees since a 31-6 loss at Rutgers on Dec. 7, 2013. Fickell doesn\u2019t think it will be much of an advantage even though the Bearcats are practicing in the cold.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you this: It could be 10 degrees, it could be 5 degrees,\u201d Fickell said, \u201cbut if you\u2019ve got the momentum and you\u2019ve got the energy because you\u2019re running down the field and scoring or stopping them on defense, I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re from South Florida or Alaska \u2014 it doesn\u2019t bother you nearly as much.\u201d\n\nBEST D: Cincinnati got its second shutout of the season against Navy, the first time since 1981 that the Bearcats have blanked more than one opponent. They also beat Miami of Ohio 21-0. The Bearcats lead the league in total defense, scoring defense and stopping the run, with a veteran line anchoring a unit that\u2019s showing more versatility as it gets deeper in the season.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s encouraging,\u201d Broughton said. \u201cYou see the puzzle pieces getting put together and having an outcome that\u2019s unmatched.\u201d\n\nRUNNING FOR RECORDS: Michael Warren II has run for at least one touchdown in eight of Cincinnati\u2019s nine games.

(AP Photo/Rui Vieira)\n\nLONDON (AP) \u2014 Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola raised the prospect Friday of soccer authorities punishing the Premier League champions over attempts to circumvent financial fair play rules.\n\nCity is leaving Guardiola to field questions about the leaked internal correspondence published by European media outlets, while executives decline comment. The club has not disputed the authenticity of internal messages showing how it used companies linked to the Abu Dhabi ownership to boost revenue in an attempt to curb losses and comply with UEFA regulations.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s something wrong we\u2019ll be punished,\u201d Guardiola said at a news conference ahead of Sunday\u2019s derby against Manchester United.\n\nCity, which has been owned by Abu Dhabi\u2019s Sheikh Mansour for a decade, was punished by UEFA in 2014 for breaching the \u201cFinancial Fair Play\u201d program. The settlement agreement eventually saw the club only forfeit 20 million euros ($23 million) in Champions League prize money. UEFA this week has not said how aware it was of City\u2019s schemes, reported by German magazine Der Spiegel, to hide expenses and evade monitoring of spending on players.\n\n\u201cAt the end, UEFA, FIFA, English federation has to say if we were wrong,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cIf we were wrong (we) will accept it but I hear what my club said to me and I trust a lot of them.\u201d\n\nThere was no response to an email sent to three City media officers seeking comment on Guardiola discussing the possibility of the club facing further punishment. City did, however, send an emailed statement announcing a new contract through 2023 for winger Raheem Sterling on Friday.\n\nCity has also not responded to questions from The Associated Press about Guardiola\u2019s contract, specifically whether he receives income from entities in Abu Dhabi or other teams owned by Sheikh Mansour. The Football Leaks group published details showing how Roberto Mancini, who managed City from 2009 to 2013 and won the Premier League title in 2012, received more pay from a team Sheikh Mansour owns in Abu Dhabi to work as a consultant than from the Manchester club.\n\nCity has faced a week of damaging headlines about its conduct and financial arrangements since the first leaks were published a week ago.\n\nDer Spiegel showed how the team\u2019s holding company \u2014 state-backed Abu Dhabi United Group \u2014 sent cash to a shell vehicle which was created to supposedly buy the right to use players\u2019 images in marketing campaigns. This helped turn almost 30 million euros ($34 million) into revenue instead of a cost, for the purpose of UEFA\u2019s investigation of club accounts as the club tried to avoid being banned from European competitions for overspending.\n\nWhile City said it \u201cwill not be providing any comment on out of context materials,\u201d Guardiola was more open to discussing information related to the Football Leaks investigation. Real Madrid was revealed to be working with consultants on a 16-team Super League to kick off in 2021, effectively replacing the Champions League and outside the control of UEFA.\n\n\u201cI would like to know the ideas,\u201d said Guardiola, who is in his third season coaching City. \u201cBut, for me, the Premier League, local leagues, are so important, with all the history.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nRob Harris is at www.twitter.com/RobHarris and www.facebook.com/RobHarrisReports", "FILE - This file booking image provided by the Denver Police Department shows Michael Hancock.

(AP) \u2014 A man charged with killing three people in Missouri this month should have faced deportation proceedings after he was arrested last year for a separate offense in New Jersey, instead of being released, federal immigration officials said Friday.\n\nTwenty-three-year-old Luis Perez, who is from Mexico, is charged with fatally shooting two men and wounding two others Nov. 1 and then fatally shooting a woman the next day. He is jailed without bond on 11 felonies, including first-degree murder and assault.

ICE has railed against so-called \u201csanctuary cities\u201d and policies it says compromise public safety; immigrant advocates argue the agency targets suspects who have been charged but not yet found guilty, depriving them of the right to contest the charges.\n\nMiddlesex County adopted a policy last year that honors detainer requests from ICE if the inmate has previously been convicted of a first- or second-degree offense or was the subject of a final order of deportation signed by a federal judge.\n\nIn the case of Perez, county officials said via email from a spokeswoman Friday, ICE was advised the county wouldn\u2019t honor its detainer request in December because it didn\u2019t meet the necessary criteria. During the ensuing 51 days Perez was in custody, officials wrote, ICE didn\u2019t request an order of deportation from a federal judge.\n\n\u201cThis order would have authorized Middlesex County to turn over custody of Mr. Perez prior to, or upon completion of his sentence,\u201d they wrote. \u201cInstead ICE officials chose to do nothing, which places all responsibility of Mr. Perez\u2019s actions squarely upon ICE.\n\nAccording to authorities in Missouri, Perez opened fire on Steven Marler, 38, and Aaron Hampton, 23, at their home in Springfield, Missouri, on Nov. 1. Two other people were wounded but survived. Perez then shot and killed Sabrina Starr, 21, a day later at her house, the documents say. Perez faces eight other felony counts in the shootings.\n\nAaron Anderson, 19, told investigators he was waiting with Starr in an SUV outside Hampton and Marler\u2019s home when Perez shot them.

The Knights have scored at least 30 points in 21 consecutive games, the longest such streak in the country.\n\nMilton, eighth in Heisman Trophy balloting a year ago, has thrown for 2,109 yards, 19 touchdowns and just five interceptions. Greg McCrae is coming off rushing for 188 yards and one TD against Temple.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re pretty much unstoppable on offense,\u201d said Niumatalolo, whose defense is allowing 441.4 yards and 36.2 points per game.\n\nTRIPLE OPTION\n\nNavy has one of the most productive running attacks in the nation, ranking third behind Georgia Teach and Army at 286.9 yards per game. The bad news is the Midshipmen are coming off being held to a season-low 124 yards on the ground in the loss to Cincinnati.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never been beat like that,\u201d Niumatalolo said.\n\nHeupel said preparing to face a triple option scheme is a challenge, noting it\u2019s difficult to simulate Navy\u2019s offense in practice.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough because it\u2019s completely different than what we do offensively,\u201d the UCF coach said. \u201cAll our kids over there giving the looks have got to do a great job of buying into being different ... and understand the importance of the speed, the tempo, the looks that they\u2019re going to play with, whether it\u2019s their motions from their backs or whatever it might be.\u201d\n\nONE OF FOUR\n\nUCF is one of four undefeated remaining in the FBS, along with Alabama, Clemson and Notre Dame \u2014 the top three teams in the AP and CFP rankings.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "FILE - In this Saturday, Nov. 3, 2018, file photo, Cleveland Cavaliers' Cedi Osman (16) leans a shoulder into Charlotte Hornets' Kemba Walker (15) during the first half of an NBA basketball game in Charlotte, N.C.

If anything, it\u2019s getting worse.\n\nCleveland, which already has the worst record in the NBA at 1-10, will be without yet another starter on Saturday night in Chicago after forward Cedi Osman was ruled out with back spasms.\n\nHe\u2019s the latest Cavs player to join an injury list that includes All-Star forward Kevin Love, point guard George Hill and Sam Dekker, who began the season as a reserve but moved into the starting lineup because of all the injuries.\n\nThrow in a coaching change, some off-court drama and this Cleveland season is sinking fast.\n\nOsman was forced to leave Wednesday\u2019s loss to Oklahoma City in the first quarter, and the Cavs were hoping rest would allow him to face the Bulls. However, coach Larry Drew said Osman will sit out against the Bulls \u201cand we\u2019ll see how he is after the game tomorrow.\u201d\n\nThe rash of injuries has put even greater stress on Drew, who took over after Tyronn Lue was fired following a 0-6 start. Drew asked the team to restructure his contract for the remainder of the season, knowing this rebuilding season would be a challenge.\n\nHe never imagined this challenging.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about snake bit,\u201d he said when asked about Cleveland\u2019s run of bad medical luck. \u201cInjuries are part of the NBA. When you lose players, other people have to step up. With our situation with K. Love out and then Dekker, now George Hill and Cedi, we\u2019re looking at four starters that are out. That\u2019s just what it is. But we\u2019re not going to hang our heads.\u201d\n\nDrew\u2019s had to adjust his starting lineup and rotation several times already this season, and now he\u2019s going to have to do it again.\n\nDrew is running out of options and he\u2019s particularly limited up front with three forwards on the shelf. Drew has been resistant to use forwards Larry Nance Jr. and Tristan Thompson together, but may no longer have a choice.\n\nHe got good minutes from center Ante Zizic, who scored 10 points and added nine rebounds while playing a season-high 17 minutes against the Thunder.\n\n\u201cWith two big guys out there, it does give us a little flexibility as far as some of the things we can do on both ends of the floor,\u201d Drew said. \u201cZ played well the other night, so I think between the three of those guys, moving forward we could see a combination of either because they do give me flexibility.\u201d\n\nDrew sees potential in the 6-foot-11 Zizic, who came to Cleveland from Boston in the blockbuster 2017 trade that sent Kyrie Irving to the Celtics.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got great hands,\u201d Drew said. \u201cIf you throw the ball anywhere around his vicinity, chances are he\u2019s going to get it. He does some very, very intriguing things when he\u2019s on the floor. I\u2019m going to do everything in my power to get him those playing minutes because when he\u2019s in the game, good things happen for us and it\u2019s very obvious.\u201d\n\nWith healthy bodies dwindling, the Cavs signed guard Andrew Harrison to a two-way contract.\n\nThe 6-foot-6 Harrison made 64 starts over the past two seasons for Memphis. The Grizzlies waived him after one game this season, and he\u2019s found a new home with a Cleveland team that needs him.\n\n\u201cWe really needed to add another ball handler,\u201d said Drew, adding Harrison will likely play Saturday. \u201cI\u2019m really excited about him because at that point guard spot he gives us some size. That was one of the intriguing things about him. I remember just playing against him, how he\u2019s played well against us. I\u2019m real excited to have him.\u201d\n\nPer league rules, Harrison can spend only 45 days with the Cavs before they must sign him to an NBA contract.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/tag/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports", "BALTIMORE (AP) \u2014 The Baltimore Symphony Orchestra has suspended a concertmaster after allegations of his \u201cinappropriate behavior\u201d toward another orchestra employee surfaced.\n\nThe Baltimore Sun reports BSO management suspended concertmaster Jonathan Carney after it came to the group\u2019s attention Thursday that he allegedly threatened an employee of the Mid-Atlantic Symphony Orchestra.

An FBI spokeswoman previously noted an incorrect age for him.\n\nRussell had worked for more than three years for Horizon Air, which is part of Alaska Air Group and flies shorter routes throughout the U.S. West.\n\n\u201cThe FBI found this was an isolated, unanticipated incident by one individual,\u201d the airline said in a statement. It also noted that the Transportation Security Administration\u2019s separate investigation also determined Horizon Air didn\u2019t violate security regulations.\n\nThe airline called it \u201ca very difficult moment for us and many others\u201d and said it is working with experts and the government to consider security \u201cenhancements\u201d going forward.\n\nThe Port of Seattle said it expects its own independent review to be finished by the end of the year and that it has taken immediate action to \u201cimprove security and fully support the aviation employees who we depend upon every day.\u201d\n\nThe FBI\u2019s probe indicates that Russell arrived for work that afternoon at the airport without any issues.\n\nBy that evening, Russell was on and off the Horizon Air Q400, a turboprop plane that seats 76 people, to position it for flight. The plane then moved away from its parked location around 7:30 p.m. and was seen performing acrobatic stunts before the fatal plunge into a thick forest on Ketron Island. It was trailed by two military F-15C jets that scrambled from Portland, Oregon, to chase the plane.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m going to try to do a barrel roll, and if that goes good I\u2019ll go nose down and call it a night,\u201d Russell said from the cockpit, according to a recording of his conversation with the controller.\n\nThe FBI said it doesn\u2019t appear that Russell violated any other security measures or protocols before the plane took off.\n\nRussell was properly credentialed with access to the interior and exterior of the aircraft. As part of his duties, he also knew about the aircraft\u2019s auxiliary power unit, tow equipment and maneuvering operations, though he didn\u2019t appear to have any formal flight training.\n\nInvestigators determined that he knew how to start up the airplane and had searched the internet for flight instructional videos.\n\nThe investigation also showed that the plane had a significant sideslip in the final minute of the flight but the crash appears intentional because Russell would have had time to pull the plane back into a climb. Instead, the plane column moved further forward for six seconds before the crash.\n\nInvestigators didn\u2019t find any signs of any co-conspirators or Russell addressing a motive for the incident, based on its review of his text messages, including those sent that night, and through interviews with his co-workers, friends and family.\n\nRussell was last heard cracking jokes, complimenting the professional demeanor of an air traffic controller and apologizing for making a fuss in his last moments. He also told the controller he \u201cwasn\u2019t really planning on landing\u201d the aircraft, and he described himself as \u201cjust a broken guy.\u201d\n\nThe medical examiner\u2019s office in its review ruled the death a suicide caused by multiple traumatic injuries, and noted that \u201cthere is sufficient evidence to conclude that the death was intentional.\u201d", "", "", "", "This undated photo from the Alabama Department of Corrections shows inmate Dominique Ray.

But he also insisted that he owed it to his players to stick with them through the end of the season, and that\u2019s why he accepted Long\u2019s offer to do so.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be one of the funnest games that we get to play in,\u201d Beaty said. \u201cI know our guys are really excited about it, and we simply will not allow any distractions to come into our view. Everything that we have and want is still right in front of us, and we expect to get those things accomplished starting with this week.\u201d\n\nBy that, Beaty means become bowl-eligible.

Shelley had been the Wildcats\u2019 best defensive back with 33 tackles and three picks before his injury.\n\nQB CALCUATIONS\n\nBoth teams have shuffled quarterbacks much of the season but both pictures have cleared up. The Jayhawks appear intent on finishing the season behind Peyton Bender, and the Wildcats are relying on Alex Delton after an injury to Skyler Thompson.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a threat with his feet,\u201d Jayhawks defensive tackle Daniel Wise said. \u201cOur goal is to keep him in the pocket.\u201d\n\nBOOM OR BUST\n\nKansas State\u2019s offense has at times looked dominant and disastrous, and offensive lineman Adam Holtorf said that may be his biggest disappointment.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the tape,\u201d he said, \u201cthat\u2019s something that\u2019s plagued us all year.

You\u2019re sitting this one out.\n\nNew York Jets quarterback Sam Darnold was listed as doubtful Friday for the team\u2019s game against Buffalo on Sunday, making it highly unlikely he will serve as Josh McCown\u2019s backup.\n\nWhile coach Todd Bowles left open the possibility Darnold could still dress for the game, the rookie did not practice all week after straining his right foot last Sunday in the Jets\u2019 13-6 loss at Miami. He wore a boot on his foot and watched from the side during practice.\n\nDavis Webb is likely to be signed from the practice squad to the active roster to provide insurance for the 39-year-old McCown, who will make his first start of the season.\n\n\u201cHow he feels, how we think he compares as to having Davis as the backup,\u201d Bowles said of what will go into the decision on Darnold. \u201cWe\u2019ll think about a lot of stuff.\u201d\n\nThe Jets (3-6) will have a bye-week break after they play the Bills, with their next game on Nov. 25 against New England. That would give Darnold three weeks to heal \u2014 although Bowles said the timing didn\u2019t factor in the team sitting him for McCown.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just not healthy right now,\u201d Bowles said of Darnold.\n\nBowles said on Thursday that Darnold will move back into the starting role once he\u2019s healthy, regardless of how McCown is playing.\n\nMcCown was the starter last season and had a career year before missing the final three games with a broken left hand. He played limited snaps in the preseason, but Bowles isn\u2019t concerned about potential rust.\n\n\u201cHe looks like a spring chicken right now,\u201d the coach said. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t played in a while, so he\u2019s very camp fresh right now. He should be fine.\u201d\n\nDarnold leads the NFL with 14 interceptions and his play took a bad turn during New York\u2019s three-game losing streak. He has two touchdown passes and seven INTs in that span while working with a supporting cast that has been hit hard by injuries and inconsistency.\n\nMcCown will likely be without one of his key receivers, with Robby Anderson doubtful to play after not practicing all week with an ankle injury.\n\nAnderson has been dealing with it the past few weeks, but played last Sunday against Miami after sitting out against Chicago.\n\n\u201cIt just didn\u2019t get any better,\u201d Bowles said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t suffer anything (more). It kind of just didn\u2019t get any better.\u201d\n\nIt appeared wide receiver Quincy Enunwa would also be uncertain to play after missing the first two days of practice, also with an ankle injury. But, he was a full participant Friday and is expected to start.\n\nThis will be the first regular-season game in which Enunwa, who leads the Jets with 25 catches, will play with McCown. Enunwa sat out all last season with a neck injury and was limited this summer while recovering from that before injuring a thumb.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t really play in camp because I was hurt, so I didn\u2019t really get much (time) with Sam,\u201d Enunwa said. \u201cBut I still ended up having a good rapport with him to start the season off. So, I\u2019m going to go at it the same way. I\u2019m just going to be where I need to be at, be in the right spot and be where he needs me to be so it\u2019s easy for him so we automatically kind of have that connection.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a good chance McCown will be taking his snaps from backup center Jonotthan Harrison because Spencer Long was listed as doubtful with knee and finger injuries that held him out of practice all week.\n\nFor several weeks, Long has been dealing with the injury to the middle finger on his right hand, which has affected his shotgun snaps. He had at least six wayward snaps against the Dolphins before being pulled.\n\nHarrison started for Long two weeks ago at Chicago, and Bowles said he\u2019s \u201cvery comfortable\u201d with him at center.\n\n\u201cWe know he\u2019s very fast, he\u2019s athletic, extremely smart and he does a good job,\u201d Bowles said. \u201cHe can play multiple positions as well, so it won\u2019t be strange having him in there.\u201d\n\nTight end Neal Sterling will miss his second straight game with a concussion, while nose tackle Steve McLendon is questionable with an ankle injury.\n\nTop cornerback Trumaine Johnson is set to return after missing five games with an injured right quadriceps.

(AP) \u2014 Penn State needs more out of its offense or the 21st-ranked Nittany Lions might not get much more out of their season.\n\nThe team started the year with Big Ten championship and playoff hopes and had averaged 49 points over a 24-3 stretch. But the Nittany Lions have hit a wall with Wisconsin (6-3, 4-2 Big Ten) up next.\n\nPenn State (6-3, 3-3, No. 20 CFP) will try to erase last week\u2019s humiliating loss in Ann Arbor where its offense was held to single digits for the first time since 2014.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be very important that we find a way to establish the run game,\u201d Penn State coach James Franklin said. \u201cSo there\u2019s not so much on the shoulders of Trace McSorley.\u201d\n\nThe Nittany Lions averaged 252 yards rushing through the first six weeks of the season and had 200-plus on the ground in nine straight games, dating back to last year. They\u2019ll take to Beaver Stadium on Saturday looking for a spark after averaging just 120 rushing over the last three games.\n\nRunning back Miles Sanders has remained diligent. He said the backs paid a visit to the offensive line room this week to let the linemen know they have faith in them.\n\nFranklin does, too.\n\nHe\u2019s seen them crack open holes for Sanders, whose patient approach can quickly become big plays \u2014 like a 48-yard touchdown sprint through multiple tacklers against Michigan State four weeks ago.\n\nBut those chunk runs have been rare, especially as McSorley, the other cog in the two-headed rushing attack, has dealt with a sore right knee.\n\n\u201cMiles has shown that he can be a big-play back in this conference and that he can carry the load and get you the tough yards, as well as the big plays,\u201d Franklin said.\n\nThe Badgers have one of those star backs, too. Jonathan Taylor leads the nation in rushing with 151 yards per game and is a critical facet for the Badgers\u2019 slow-burn offensive approach.\n\nRB DEPTH\n\nThe Badgers\u2019 running back group goes beyond Taylor.\n\nTaiwan Deal is an effective backup who can spell Taylor for a series, while Garrett Groshek has turned into the primary third-down back with his ability to run, catch passes and block. Fullback Alec Ingold is also a threat in short-yardage situations. He\u2019s surprised defenses at times this season with clutch receptions out of the backfield.\n\nONE WIN AWAY\n\nMcSorley is one victory away from tying Penn State\u2019s record for wins by a starting quarterback (29).\n\nHe\u2019s expected to start despite a right knee injury suffered against Iowa two weeks ago. While McSorley returned to that game and started against the Wolverines last week, he didn\u2019t have the same mobility that helped him seize the program\u2019s all-time yardage record.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s tough as hell and he\u2019s battled through a lot for this team, so we are going to put it all on the line for him,\u201d Taylor said.\n\nBackup Tommy Stevens entered the game last week and scored Penn State\u2019s lone touchdown late. He\u2019s expected to play as well.\n\nSTURDY FRONT\n\nFrom the backend of Penn State\u2019s defense, safety Garrett Taylor has had a good viewpoint for the development of a handful of defensive linemen.\n\nHe believes Jonathan Taylor will be running into fierce competition all afternoon.\n\n\u201cThey are a talented team up front and he\u2019s a very talented back. But you know, I\u2019ve been saying for a long time, I think we\u2019re really talented as a defense. I think you\u2019ve got to look at guys like Shareef (Miller), Yetur (Gross-Matos), and Kevin (Givens), our front seven are playing really well right now,\u201d Garrett Taylor said.\n\nMiller, Gross-Matos and Givens have combined for 27 tackles for loss.\n\nDOWN A MAN\n\nWisconsin will play the rest of the season without nose tackle Olive Sagapolu, who was the anchor of the defensive front.\n\nCoach Paul Chryst said the athletic senior had surgery for his right arm injury suffered two weeks ago against Northwestern.\n\nThe Badgers will turn to freshman Bryson Williams to replace Sagapolu, joining a line that already had a freshman and sophomore starting. Sagapolu regularly drew double teams that helped free up standout inside linebackers T.J.

(AP Photo/Eric Gay, File)\n\nLUBBOCK, Texas (AP) \u2014 No. 15 Texas has gone from Big 12 leader and College Football Playoff contender to conference chaser after consecutive losses by a combined four points.\n\nTexas Tech has also lost its last two games, and their freshman quarterback took another hard shot last weekend. But the Red Raiders (5-4, 3-3 Big 12) can get bowl eligible with a win Saturday night over the Longhorns, just like they did last year in a regular-season finale last November that most likely saved coach Kliff Kingsbury\u2019s job. This game is also the final home game for Tech\u2019s seniors.\n\n\u201cYou want them to have that moment, that memory,\u201d said Kingsbury, the former Tech quarterback in his sixth season as coach. \u201cThree of those guys have been here every day I\u2019ve been here. We have a lot of fifth-year seniors that have been through some ups and downs, and going through a lot to get to where they are at.\u201d\n\nIt is another primetime game in Lubbock, just like last week when Tech lost 51-46 to No. 6 Oklahoma. Freshman quarterback Alan Bowman, one of the nation\u2019s top passers, sustained a partially collapsed lung for the second time this season. He was hospitalized for four nights, and dual-treat Jett Duffey is expected to get his second start as Tech looks to get consecutive wins over Texas for the first time in 20 years.\n\nTexas (6-3, 4-2, No. 19 CFP) likely has to win its last three games and get some help to get into the Big 12 championship game. The Longhorns are coming off a 42-41 loss to West Virginia, when Will Grier ran for a 2-point conversion in the final minute. The Mountaineers had more than 500 total yards, like Oklahoma State a week earlier in a 38-35 win.\n\n\u201cPlaying a bit tentative. I think for whatever reason we haven\u2019t cut it loose at times,\u201d coach Tom Herman said of the Texas defense. \u201cThat\u2019s on us to figure out why. Maybe it\u2019s an uncertainty. Yeah, just playing tentative at times.\u201d\n\nIt doesn\u2019t help that Texas is banged up on defense. Senior defensive end Breckyn Hager (dislocated elbow) was hurt last week but was able to return to practice this week and could play Saturday. Senior cornerback Davante Davis (neck) also could return. Junior safety Brandon Jones (ankle) is questionable to play while Hager\u2019s backup, Marquez Bimage is out with a shoulder injury.\n\nHOOK\u2019EM DOWN\n\nPenalizing West Virginia players for taunting for flashing downward \u201cHook\u2019em Horns\u201d hand signals raised new questions over whether the Longhorns get special treatment. Kingsbury this week told his players not to risk it and has issued similar instructions in the past. Texas players call it disrespectful and things could get chippy if a Red Raiders player does it in the heat of the moment. The Red Raiders were penalized for it in Tech\u2019s win in Austin last year.\n\n\u201cIt bothers us a lot because we take pride in what we do and that logo,\u201d Texas wide receiver Lil\u2019Jordan Humphrey said.\n\nRUNNING RED RAIDERS\n\nWhile Texas Tech has one of the nation\u2019s top passing games and leads the Big 12 with 376 yards a game, the Red Raiders\u2019 25 rushing touchdowns are second in the league behind Oklahoma\u2019s 26.\n\n\u201cThe quarterback and receivers get a lot of the publicity, if you will,\u201d Herman said. \u201cYou better be able to stop the run or you\u2019re going to bleed a slow death. They do it well enough to make you have to defend it.\u201d\n\nEMERGING EHLINGER\n\nDespite the two-game losing streak, Texas quarterback Sam Ehlinger keeps getting better. He had one of his best career games last week with 354 yards passing and three touchdowns and ran for another score. He leads Texas with nine rushing touchdowns. His long TD pass to Devin Duvernay gave Texas the lead with less than 3 minutes left. Ehlinger hasn\u2019t thrown an interception in since the first game, but he had a bad one late against Texas Tech last season that set up the Red Raiders\u2019 winning touchdown.\n\nHELLO OLD FRIEND\n\nRed Raiders defensive back John Bonney played 37 for Texas the past three seasons before going to Texas Tech as a graduate transfer in August.\n\n\u201cJohn\u2019s a graduate of the University of Texas and gave us four years of his blood, sweat and tears and we\u2019re very thankful for that,\u201d Herman said.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Jim Vertuno contributed to this report from Austin, Texas.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "PROVIDENCE, R.I.

But Mayfield also played mind games with the best of them, and it appears Murray was a willing apprentice.\n\nAmong other things, Mayfield wore a handlebar mustache the week of games against Oklahoma State, declaring a new sheriff was in town. With Oklahoma State visiting the sixth-ranked Sooners on Saturday, Murray stirred the pot like his predecessor. In his media availability this week, he started off by seemingly downplaying the Bedlam rivalry game.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just ready to play another game, honestly,\u201d Murray said. \u201cAnother great opportunity for us as a team against a good team.

When asked about Oklahoma State\u2019s pass rush, Murray said, \u201cI don\u2019t really have a comment on them right now.\u201d\n\nHe was asked if he had relationships with Oklahoma State\u2019s players, he replied, \u201cNot really. I mean, I was recruited by Oklahoma State. Other than that, I don\u2019t really know them.\u201d\n\nWhen asked who recruited him, he claimed he couldn\u2019t remember Oklahoma State offensive coordinator Mike Yurcich\u2019s name, then mispronounced it. When asked if he liked Yurcich, Murray simply said, \u201cI\u2019m not a fan of Stillwater,\u201d the location of Oklahoma State\u2019s campus.\n\nOklahoma State has a chance to become bowl eligible with a win and provide a highlight for an up-and-down season that includes wins over Texas and Boise State and an ugly loss to Kansas State.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a special weekend for everybody,\u201d Oklahoma State coach Mike Gundy said. \u201cIt always has been. Everybody wears orange or red this week. It\u2019s a big game. I think that works to our benefit. I know they (Oklahoma State\u2019s players) will be riled up, too. They will be excited to play in this game.\u201d\n\nOklahoma needs a win to stay within reach of a spot in the College Football Playoff. The Sooners also are trying to keep their place atop the Big 12 standings with West Virginia.\n\nSECOND HALF SOONERS\n\nOklahoma has been strong defensively in the second half of games since Ruffin McNeill took over as interim defensive coordinator after the loss to Texas. The Sooners gave up 24 points in the first half against TCU, but three in the second half. They allowed just seven in each half against Kansas State, then allowed 31 in the first half against Texas Tech, but just 15 in the second half of a 51-46 win .\n\nANOTHER SHOOTOUT?\n\nOklahoma defeated Oklahoma State 62-52 last year in the highest-scoring game in Bedlam history. Mayfield passed for a school-record 598 yards and tossed five touchdown passes. Oklahoma\u2019s Marquise Brown broke out with a school-record 265 yards receiving. A similar shootout could ensue this year \u2014 Oklahoma ranks second nationally in total offense, while Oklahoma State is 10th.\n\nDELIVERING JUSTICE\n\nOklahoma State\u2019s running back has 3,504 yards rushing in his career, seventh in school history. The junior needs 277 yards to move past Ernest Anderson for sixth place, and 294 yards to move past Barry Sanders for fifth. He ran for 228 yards in last year\u2019s game against Oklahoma.\n\nSERMONATOR\n\nOklahoma running back Trey Sermon ran for career highs of 26 carries, 206 yards and three touchdowns against Texas Tech last week.

(AP Photo/Rick Bowmer, File)\n\nSALT LAKE CITY (AP) \u2014 The big question facing Utah when it hosts Oregon is whether Jason Shelley can pick up where Tyler Huntley left off.\n\nShelley, a redshirt freshman, will make his first career start Saturday against the Ducks in place of Huntley, who broke his collarbone in the third quarter of Utah\u2019s 38-20 loss last week to Arizona State.\n\nShelley struggled after being thrown into action against the Sun Devils. He threw for 59 yards and an interception on 4-of-11 passing. With a full week of taking reps as a starter in practice, and having the game plan adjusted to fit his individual strengths, Utah\u2019s coaches are confident Shelley can produce better results against the Ducks.\n\nUtah coach Kyle Whittingham said Shelley is similar to Huntley in his running and passing skill set. Whittingham said the freshman also brings a fearless attitude that will help the offense adjust to Shelley quicker.\n\n\u201cOne thing is he\u2019s very calm under pressure,\u201d Whittingham said. \u201cNot that Tyler is not, but his demeanor is very even-keeled. He doesn\u2019t panic and doesn\u2019t press.\u201d\n\nThe Utes will need Shelley to adjust to his new role quickly after losing Zack Moss to a knee injury. Moss suffered the injury at practice Wednesday and now will require season-ending surgery.\n\nIt\u2019s a big blow to the Utah offense. Moss ranks third in the Pac-12 in rushing yardage with 1,092 yards. His 6.1 yards per carry are second-best among running backs in the league.\n\nOregon expected Moss to be the top concern for its defense Saturday. Even with the Utes missing a pair of key playmakers, the Ducks don\u2019t count on it making things go any smoother with Utah.\n\n\u201cWith Utah, which is a great football program, it starts and ends with their physicality on both sides of the ball,\u201d Oregon coach Mario Cristobal said. \u201cUp front, by the truck load, they have big powerful guys that set the tone for the game. That\u2019s always been part of their identity.\u201d\n\nThe Ducks will give Utah\u2019s defense plenty of things to worry about as well.\n\nJustin Herbert is one of the league\u2019s better passers. He has thrown for 2,333 yards and 22 touchdowns while completing 59 percent of his passes. The junior lit up the Utes two years ago in a 30-28 win for Oregon in Salt Lake City, throwing for 324 yards and three touchdowns.\n\nHerbert\u2019s top target, Dillon Mitchell, leads the Pac-12 with 833 yards and six touchdowns on 56 catches. Mitchell has tallied at least 500 yards more than any other Oregon receiver this season and has a league-best 735 receiving yards on 50 catches in Pac-12 play.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d like to spread it around more, but Dillon just does a great job of getting open,\u201d Herbert said. \u201cHe runs great routes and is able to identify the coverage and adjust and do things that get him open.\u201d\n\nOther things to note ahead of this week\u2019s game between Oregon and Utah:\n\nCOVEY\u2019S IMPACT: Oregon needs no introduction to how Britain Covey can impact a game. Covey played a huge role in lifting Utah to a 62-20 road victory over the Ducks in 2015. He had a pair of touchdown receptions and also famously faked out Oregon to set up a punt return touchdown.\n\nCovey leads Utah this season with 555 yards on 50 receptions. He has tallied 85 yards on 10 carries and has thrown for 71 yards and two touchdowns on 3-of-3 passing.\n\nDAVEY O\u2019BRIEN SEMIFINALIST: Herbert was named one of 16 semifinalists for the Davey O\u2019Brien Award. He and Washington State quarterback Gardner Minshew are the only semifinalists from the Pac-12. Herbert made his 24th career start in Oregon\u2019s 42-21 win over UCLA and became the fastest Ducks player to reach 6,000 career passing yards in terms of starts.\n\nPROVIDING A SPARK: Ugochukwu Amadi\u2019s versatility is invaluable to Oregon on defense and special teams. Amadi is the only FBS player to score touchdowns off a punt return and an interception return this season. He has returned two interceptions for touchdowns and is tied for second in the Pac-12 with three interceptions. Amadi is also tied for the FBS lead with two punt returns over 50 yards. The senior has gained 20 or more yards on four of eight punt returns.\n\nRED ZONE LOCKDOWN: Scoring in the red zone has been hit or miss for the Ducks at times this season. Their conversion rate (31-of-38) ranks ninth in the Pac-12. It could play in Utah\u2019s favor. The Utes lead the nation in red zone defense.

Even taking a one-shot penalty for an unplayable lie was not an easy option. If his drop settled between rocks, he would have to play that or take another penalty.\n\nFinally, he found a spot and the drop landed in enough soft soil for him to pitch out of trouble, through the fairway and into the rough. He got his fourth shot onto the green and made the long putt to escape with bogey.\n\n\u201cThat was great,\u201d Kuchar said. \u201cI knew I had a par 5 following it, and I figured I was probably going to make double there and birdie on the next. I ended up making bogey there and par on the par-5 13th, so still felt like I was very much in control.\u201d\n\nWhat put Kuchar in good shape were the five straight birdies on the front nine, and then he took the lead for the first time with a birdie on No. 11 before his wild adventure on the 12th hole.

Mustipher reminisced this week about Wimbush\u2019s breakout performance \u2014 207 rushing yards and four touchdowns in a 49-20 victory last season at Boston College.\n\n\u2033(Wimbush) took over that game,\u201d Mustipher said. \u201cHe made some moves I\u2019ve never seen a quarterback make in a game. He\u2019s a great player and a great young man. He\u2019ll be successful in whatever he decides to do in life.\u201d\n\nThe Irish, of course, just want Wimbush to be successful against a Seminoles defense that has been stingy against the run.\n\nOpponents are averaging just 2.84 yards per carry (sixth-best nationally) and 111.1 yards per game (17th) against end Brian Burns (13.5 tackles for loss) and behemoth tackles Demarcus Christmas (6-4, 305), Fredrick Jones (6-2, 304), Marvin Wilson (6-5, 317) and Cory Durden (6-5, 290). The Seminoles have piled up 25 sacks.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think their offense is going to change much,\u201d Florida State coach Willie Taggart said. \u201cThey have a capable backup quarterback that\u2019s played a lot for them and won some games for them, too.\u201d\n\nFlorida State has been vulnerable through the air, allowing 282.6 yards per game and Wimbush averaged just 196.3 yards per game while throwing for one score in the three victories before he was replaced by Book, who averaged 301.8 yards and had 15 TD passes in the six victories.\n\n\u201cBrandon has handled it better than anybody else I know could have being put in that position,\u201d said senior wide receiver Miles Boykin, who leads the Irish with 40 receptions for 624 yards and seven touchdowns. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen him hang his head once.\u201d\n\nTALE OF TWO QBs\n\nTaggart has a little quarterback dilemma of his own: whether to start junior Deondre Francois, who has completed nearly 61 percent of his passes for 2,039 yards and 13 touchdowns before leaving the 59-10 Clemson loss with a concussion, or sophomore James Blackman, who replaced Francois and threw for 421 yards and four touchdowns in Florida State\u2019s 47-28 loss at North Carolina State.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see on Saturday,\u201d Taggart said.\n\nFrancois, who has been receiving most of the snaps with the No. 1 unit during the open portions of the team\u2019s morning practices this week, believes it will be him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still the No. 1 guy \u2014 coach Taggart continues to make that clear,\u201d Francois said. \u201cJames understands that, but James is always ready to go if anything happens to me.\u201d\n\nBABY, IT\u2019S (GOING TO BE) COLD OUTSIDE\n\nThe Seminoles, who have been practicing in summer-like conditions, may see snow upon their arrival in South Bend, where the wind chill for Saturday night\u2019s kickoff is expected to be 23 degrees.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been through tougher times than this,\u201d said the 6-foot-5, 181-pound Blackman, who has been through hurricanes in his native Florida. \u201cAh, man, it\u2019s football. I ain\u2019t going to let the weather get to us.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve played in some pretty cold games,\u201d said middle linebacker Dontavious Jackson, who played high school ball near Houston. \u201cNever played in the snow \u2014 I\u2019m looking forward to it. People think we\u2019re not because we\u2019re Southern boys, but I\u2019m actually looking forward to it.\n\nGAME OF THE CENTURY\n\nFlorida State holds a 6-2 edge (and has won the last three) in the series that has seen six games decided by seven points or less. Perhaps the best of the bunch came on Nov. 13, 1993, when Lou Holtz\u2019s second-ranked Irish were a touchdown underdog at home against Bobby Bowden\u2019s top-ranked Seminoles. In that \u201cGame of the Century,\u201d the Irish took a 31-17 lead late into the fourth quarter before eventual Heisman Trophy winner Charlie Ward mounted a late comeback. The quarterback connected with Kez McCorvey on a fourth-and-20 play for a touchdown with 1:39 remaining.\n\nAfter the Irish went three-and-out, Ward got his team to the 14 with three seconds remaining. But Shawn Wooden, playing with a torn knee ligament, knocked down Ward\u2019s pass in the end zone to preserve Notre Dame\u2019s 31-24 victory. The No. 1 Irish lost 41-39 to Boston College the following week, clearing the way for the Seminoles to earn their first national title with an 18-16 victory over Nebraska in the Orange Bowl.\n\n___\n\nBob Ferrante, a freelance reporter for the AP Tallahassee bureau, contributed to this preview.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: http://collegefootball.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25", "GENOA, Nev. (AP) \u2014 Antiques dealer Ron Bommarito leaned back on a wooden chair outside his old curiosity shop and talked about an enduring lifelong passion: his tireless efforts to find and collect valuable treasures of yesteryear. And the quirky stories behind them.\n\nJust the other day, he was out scrounging, or \u201cantique picking,\u201d talking to old-timers across central Nevada \u2014 people who responded to his postings left on country bulletin boards \u2014 about which family keepsakes they\u2019d be willing to part with.\n\nAt age 70, he\u2019s a restless wanderer, gumshoe, negotiator, voracious collector, self-taught historian and, to top it all off, genuine glad-hander.\n\nAnd when he sees something he wants, he strikes \u2014 like the rattlers that populate Northern Nevada\u2019s high-desert in the shadow of the eastern Sierra.\n\nOn this day, the pickings were slim, but Bommarito still whipped out his wallet to buy a vintage road sign, some hard-worn cowboy spurs, miner\u2019s candlesticks from the 1870s and an ancient bronze doorstop fashioned in the shape of a dog.\n\nHe calls them the trophies of his hunt \u2014 not just the antiques but the patiently told yarns and tall tales of how they were used and preserved. And unlike a museum curator who reaped the benefits of some family\u2019s generosity, Bommarito knows the hard work it takes to seek out and find all those owner-storytellers in the first place.\n\n\u201cI like hearing the stories firsthand,\u201d he told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. \u201cMost everything I own, I can pick up and say, \u2018I got this from Old Joe and this is the story I remember about it.\u2019 Of course, they might be all lies, but they\u2019re good old lies you got from some crusty old-timers, some real Western characters. Tons of them have passed away.\u201d\n\nLong before such shows as \u201cAmerican Pickers\u201d became popular TV fare, Bommarito and other antique scroungers from his generation were knocking on the doors of old-timers to size up their wares. Bommarito has amassed a sprawling private collection of Nevada history, some of it offered for sale in one of the state\u2019s oldest antique stores. He calls it the Genoa Museum and Archives.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got so much Nevada history,\u201d said Mike Holland, a fellow collector who spent decades picking by Bommarito\u2019s side. \u201cI enjoy going to his shop to watch the reactions of some of his customers. \u201cYou need a flashlight in there. It\u2019s dark.\u201d\n\nMore than just any antique bazaar, Bommarito\u2019s emporium of fine old things is equal parts antique jungle, musty pharaoh\u2019s tomb and crazy hoarder\u2019s lair. Bommarito bought the shop in this historic frontier town about 13 miles south of Carson City in 1969 and spent nearly a half-century filling the stone-and-wooden building with piles of historic Western bric-a-brac that teeter unsteadily like dusty houses of cards.\n\nCustomers must pick their way along one narrow aisle that loops past the main display case, behind which the owner perches like a sphinx ready to answer the occasional question, an old relic in camouflage-colored clothes who blends in with his artifacts. He knows one unguarded elbow could cause items worth anywhere from just a few bucks to many thousands to topple to the floor.\n\nBut the proprietor insists that\u2019s just how any antique store worth its salt should be.\n\nHe also manages a hard-to-reach back area with even more stuff, now closed off because the proprietor can\u2019t keep an eye on it, and other out buildings where he keeps his vast and yet-to-be cataloged collection.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a mystique and authenticity to the place,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is what an old antique store looked like when I was a kid.\u201d\n\nAnd he has no time for yuppies who roll in from the city looking for pretty baubles with neatly written price tags. His store, he said, is for the legitimate antique explorer.\n\nAs he sat outside entertaining guests, two women shoppers walked across the porch\u2019s creaking floorboards, past an 1885 spring wagon on display, and tentatively approached the open door, as though fearful of the contents quietly lurking inside.\n\n\u201cYou can go in,\u201d Bommarito told them. \u201cBut be careful. Don\u2019t kill yourself.\u201d\n\nThey take a few steps inside the darkened shop and return within seconds.\n\n\u201cYou all right?\u201d Bommarito asked cheerily.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little overwhelming, I have to say,\u201d one woman said.\n\nThe proprietor watched them slink off toward the bar next door. \u201cThis store isn\u2019t for everyone,\u201d he whispered. \u201cMyself, I get along most with the people who get it.\u201d\n\nBommarito isn\u2019t just a collector; like many of his clients, he\u2019s also a storyteller.\n\nHis family owned ranches in both St. Helena, California, and Northern Nevada, and he spent the summers of his youth in both places. He and other boys collected Civil War weapons, and his friend\u2019s father often took them to hock shop hideaways in San Francisco to buy guns and swords.\n\nHis first foray into antiques commerce came when he told a stranger about how he\u2019d found some Old West wagons in an abandoned ranch near St. Helena.\n\n\u201cHe bought the wheels from me,\u201d he recalled, \u201ceven though they weren\u2019t mine to sell.\u201d\n\nBack then, he pocketed the 50 cents his mother gave him for lunch every day and saved $50 to buy a Civil War carbine rifle that today is worth thousands.\n\nAt age 15, he took a job in a Gardnerville antique store called The Purple Bottle, taking his pay in old bottles. Eventually, he helped dig up thousands of old whisky and potion bottles discarded by prospectors, making enough money to buy a Corvette while still a teenager.\n\nBy then, he had caught the antique collecting bug.\n\nAfter dropping out of college, he served as a historian in the National Guard and later did a stint as a federal fish and game ranger, using his travels across Northern Nevada\u2019s back country to hunt for antiques.\n\nAt age 22, he bought the building that would become his antique shop. By then, the old structure was itself an antique. Built in 1866, soon after Nevada became a state, it served miscellaneous uses, including general store and telegraph station.\n\nNow, Bommarito had a place to store his growing collection, which focused on all things Nevada and the Wild West. He quickly developed his own style when buying antiques. \u201cInstead of fooling round and getting just the one thing in my specialty, I\u2019d buy the whole collection and spin off the other stuff.\u201d\n\nJudging by the clutter of his shop, not a lot of stuff got spun off.\n\nHe leads a tour of the back storage area, much like a docent at his own private museum.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s a Mormon diary right here,\u201d he begins, \u201cwritten in 1847.\u201d\n\nHe rummages around his collection, pulling out items and relating their stories. There\u2019s the 1920s flak jacket his grandfather wore when, according to Bommarito, he knew aviator Charles Lindbergh. He pulls out card shavers used by gambling cheats, an old door from the Nevada State prison, a railroad lantern, a cigar store Indian, an 1866 frock coat worn by Moses Tibbs, the second district attorney in Douglas County, as well as a diary kept by a settler who ventured across the Oregon Trail by covered wagon.\n\nThere are various military uniforms, sepia-toned photographs, a wooden crossbar that supported one of the Nevada Territory\u2019s first telegraph lines and a guest ledger kept at the old Silver House hotel in Silver City before it burned down in 1876. In the past, he\u2019s sold tattered denim jeans worn by the old-time miners, the last pair for thousands.\n\n\u201cI like to keep the best stuff for myself,\u201d he said.\n\nBut don\u2019t call Bommarito a pack rat or a hoarder.\n\n\u201cA pack rat is indiscriminate, and I don\u2019t hoard things,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the stuff I do keep is flat-out valuable. It\u2019s good history. You hear people say, \u2018I had one of those once.\u2019 Well, chances are, I still have mine.\u201d\n\nHe picks up a diary he said was kept by one of Custer\u2019s men.\n\n\u201cI know how hard I worked to find things like this,\u201d Bommarito said. \u201cAnd in a way it just ticks me off that some guy with money can just walk in and buy it.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to buying stuff from sellers, Bommarito offered this self-assessment. \u201cIf they\u2019re square with me, I\u2019ll be square with them,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll tell them what I think something is worth if they ask me.\u201d\n\nBut there was the garage sale where he met an old codger selling a shotgun. \u201cI asked him, \u201cDo you have any other old guns?\u2032 And he said, \u2018Oh, I got one but I know what it\u2019s worth and I won\u2019t take one penny less.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe man returned with a Buffalo rifle he said his great-grandfather had twice carried back and forth from Texas, a story Bommarito later corroborated. He paid the asking price for the weapon, which is now worth considerably more.\n\n\u201cIf he would have asked me what the gun was worth, I would have been honest,\u201d he said. \u201cBut oh no! He already knew the answer to that question.\u201d\n\nEvery now and then, when he gets the itch, he\u2019ll head out for some scrounging in old mining towns such as Austin, Goldfield and Tonopah.\n\nHolland recalled when the pair knocked on the door of a spooky ranch near Fallon, greeted by a nearly naked, white-haired woman.\n\n\u201cRon and I just looked at each other, and I said, \u2018We\u2019re looking for old stuff and you seem to have a lot,\u2018\u201d Holland said. \u201cShe said \u2018Oh, I don\u2019t have nothin\u2019.\u201d And I said, \u2018Can we at least have a look?\u2019\u201d\n\nWhen she turned on the light, the pair of pickers saw gold: Her walls were filled with Indian baskets she\u2019d been given over the years. They bought most of them.\n\nBommarito admits he likes the thrill of the hunt as much as the trophy. \u201cThis is a sport and I enjoy winning,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m getting older. I don\u2019t have the killer instincts I had when I was 30.\u201d\n\nIn the early 1980s, a Hollywood crew offered Bommarito $5,000 to use his house to film the movie \u201cHonky Tonk Man\u201d starring Clint Eastwood. \u201cThat was a lot of money in those days, but he wanted $7,000,\u201d and turned them down, Holland said. \u201cThat\u2019s Ron.\u201d\n\nOn this afternoon, Bommarito is still rummaging in his backroom, considering prizes and victories past. There\u2019s a bearskin jacket worn by an old stagecoach driver and an original 1860 banner from the Nevada Territory\u2019s first fire department in Virginia City.\n\n\u201cThe stuff in here,\u201d he said, \u201cit just goes on and on forever.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Las Vegas Review-Journal, http://www.lvrj.com", "YPSILANTI, Mich.

I started following closely the performance that Ross was doing on the track,\u201d Carpoff said. \u201cHere at Phoenix earlier this year, I saw Ross in the driver meeting and I told him I was going to try to do something for him.

(AP Photo/Eric Gay)\n\nSAN DIEGO (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump ordered Friday that anyone who enters the U.S. illegally from Mexico by going around official border crossings is ineligible for asylum.\n\nHis edict takes aim at the cherished principle of asylum, which grants haven to people who flee persecution on grounds of race, religion, nationality, political opinion and other factors.\n\nIllegal border crossings are low compared to the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s but there\u2019s no question the asylum system is under severe strain.\n\nHere are questions and answers about the new rules:\n\nWHAT DOES THE NEW BAN DO?\n\nThe president is denying asylum to people who enter the country from Mexico without going through official border crossings, effective Saturday.\n\nThat means people can keep claiming asylum if they present themselves to U.S. authorities at any of the 26 border crossings with Mexico. But it\u2019s now banned anywhere else along the border.\n\nFor example, tens of thousands of immigrants in recent years have been showing up in the Arizona desert or crossing the Rio Grande in Texas and then turning themselves in to border agents and seeking asylum. Under the new rules, those immigrants will now face steep barriers to getting in the country \u2014 and deportation in many cases.\n\nThe government says about 70,000 people who went around official crossings in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30 sought asylum. Another 24,000 presented themselves to U.S. inspectors.\n\nWHY DOES THE ADMINISTRATION SAY THE ASYLUM SYSTEM IS IN CRISIS?\n\nThe United States fielded 331,700 asylum claims last year, nearly double from two years earlier and surpassing Germany as highest in the world, according to the UN Refugee Agency. Many are families and young children fleeing gangs and poverty in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.\n\nThe surge has contributed to an enormous backlog in immigration courts, which is where asylum cases must be decided if the applicant passes an initial screening. The backlog has more than doubled to 1.1 million cases in about two years, Syracuse University\u2019s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse reported this week.\n\nAsylum seekers are often released, many with ankle monitors, while their cases wind through court for years. The Trump administration calls it \u201ccatch and release\u201d and notes that, while about 8 of 10 asylum seekers pass the initial screening, known as a \u201ccredible fear\u201d interview, most are ultimately unsuccessful in court.\n\nThere are many reasons why the courts are broken. Immigrant advocates point to a shortage of judges.\n\nWILL IT WORK?\n\nAlmost immediately, the American Civil Liberties Union sued over the president\u2019s order in federal court in San Francisco, seeking to declare it invalid and stop it from going into effect while litigation is pending.\n\nTrump is invoking the same extraordinary powers he used to ban travel to the U.S. from several predominantly Muslim countries, which was upheld by the Supreme Court in June. Under a section of federal immigration law, the president may deny entry to \u201cany class of aliens\u201d whose presence is deemed \u201cdetrimental to the interests of the United States.\u201d\n\nBut under the Immigration and Nationality Act, anyone can apply for asylum no matter how or where they enter the country. And the 1951 United Nations Refugee Convention, of which the U.S. is a signatory, says people may apply for asylum even if they enter a country illegally.\n\nAdministration officials argue that U.S. law already has some bars on asylum \u2014 being part of a terrorist organization or having committed a serious crime, for example \u2014 and that \u201cwithholding of removal\u201d and protection under the U.N. Convention Against Torture.\n\nThe administration also emphasizes that people can still seek asylum at official crossings instead of entering the country illegally by going around them, but that poses logistical challenges. Asylum seekers currently wait in Mexican border cities \u2014 up to five weeks in Tijuana \u2014 because inspectors at U.S. crossings say they don\u2019t have the capacity to process their claims.\n\nWHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THE IMMIGRANTS?\n\nUnder the new rule, immigrants caught crossing the border and seeking asylum will be transported to a nearby port of entry and denied asylum if they seek it.\n\nThey will be allowed to seek other, more limited forms of protection but the initial screening, known as a \u201creasonable fear\u201d interview, is much harder to pass.

(AP) \u2014 Star sophomore Laviska Shenault Jr . indicated on Instagram that he\u2019d be back on the field Saturday when slumping Colorado hosts No. 10 Washington State.\n\nHis return would provide a big boost for the banged-up Buffaloes (5-4, 2-4), who were once the last remaining unbeaten team in the Pac-12 but now face the possibility of missing out on a bowl berth that was in their grasp two weeks ago before they blew a 28-point second-half lead to lowly Oregon State.\n\n\u201cThe return of 2Live ..\u201d Shenault posted Sunday night.\n\nBuffaloes coach Mike MacIntyre was more cautious, saying Shenault \u201cdid a little bit\u201d in his return to practice Monday but labeling him \u201cstill day to day.\u201d\n\n\u201cHopefully we\u2019ll get him back sometime before the year is over,\u201d MacIntyre said.\n\nThe Buffs were 5-0 when Shenault got hurt at USC, and Colorado lost that game and the next three without the superstar receiver who had six TD receptions and five TD runs before getting injured.\n\nShenault was a Heisman hopeful as he piled up 780 yards on 60 receptions and 87 yards on 15 rushes, and his return took on more urgency when Buffaloes receivers Jay MacIntyre (concussion) and K.D. Nixon (hip) got hurt last week at Arizona.\n\nSo, Shenault\u2019s social media post was an encouraging sign as the Buffs prepared for the Cougars (8-1, 5-1, No. 8 CFP) who are the Pac-12\u2032s last remaining hope for a College Football Playoff berth.\n\nCoach MacIntyre doesn\u2019t want to make excuses, but acknowledges Shenault\u2019s injury was a backbreaker.\n\n\u201cI think when you take a Heisman Trophy candidate out of the picture, it\u2019s a big deal,\u201d MacIntyre said. \u201cIf you had taken Rashaan Salaam off the \u201994 team, I don\u2019t know they might still have been really good, they had a lot of great players. But you take a Heisman Trophy candidate out at the time he left, he was leading the country in every category kind of like (Washington State QB Gardner Minshew).\n\n\u201cIf you take Minshew out, it might change Washington State. We haven\u2019t had our best football player on the field since halfway through the USC game, so he only played five and a half games.\u201d\n\nOther subplots in the 12th meeting between the Cougars and Buffaloes:\n\nCLOSE CALLS: The Buffs\u2019 losses during their skid have come by a total of 40 points and include two one-score heartbreakers.\n\n\u201cAll four losses were close games,\u201d Colorado linebacker Rick Gamboa said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we\u2019ve gotten blown out or anything. In all games, we had a chance to win. Just little things and corrections we need to make. We are preaching that in practice.\u201d\n\nMAGIC MINSHEW: Minshew is the nation\u2019s leading passer with 3,517 yards, 27 TDs and seven interceptions.\n\n\u201cHe makes all the right throws,\u201d MacIntyre said. \u201cHe\u2019s from Brandon, Mississippi, I know right where he\u2019s from. I used to recruit in that area when I was at Ole Miss. That\u2019s a football area right there, right outside of Jackson. He has mobility, he\u2019s making throws.\u201d\n\nCOUGARS O-LINE: MacIntyre said the unsung heroes of the Cougars\u2019 Air-Raid offense is the O-line.\n\n\u201cNobody hardly gets near him very much. They do an excellent job. The offensive line is big and athletic, they\u2019ve done a good job with those guys,\u201d MacIntyre said. \u201cI\u2019ve been very impressed with their offensive line, that\u2019s helping it flow like they want it to.\u201d\n\nPOINTS OF PRIDE: A week after winning a shootout against Stanford, Washington State bogged down and needed a late touchdown catch by Easop Winston Jr. to edge Cal 19-13 last week. They converted just 4 of 12 third downs and scored just two TDS in five red zone trips.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of my team,\u201d Cougars coach Mike Leach said. \u201cThose are very tough opponents. This whole conference is tough.\u201d\n\nBIG BUFF FAN: One Buff who really impresses Leach is ... Ralphie, the live buffalo mascot.\n\n\u201cTheir mascot is just outstanding,\u201d Leach said. \u201cHim and Mike the Tiger (from LSU) are the best. ...

(AP Photo/Kathy Matheson, File)\n\nBISMARCK, N.D. (AP) \u2014 A fall survey indicates the mule deer population in the western North Dakota Badlands continued its rebound this year, though doe hunting remained off-limits in one northwestern unit for a seventh straight year as the gun season began Friday.\n\nThe aerial survey by the Game and Fish Department counted 2,446 mule deer. That was down only slightly from last year, and fawn reproduction was up. The fawn-to-doe ratio of 84 fawns per 100 does was up from 76 per 100 in 2017, and only slightly lower than the long-term average of 89 per 100.\n\nFawn production has been improving since 2013, following a record low after a string of three straight harsh winters ending in 2011, according to big game biologist Bruce Stillings.\n\n\u201cThis is encouraging news for continued growth of mule deer in the Badlands,\u201d he said.\n\nHunting of mule deer females was banned four straight seasons beginning in 2012, to help the population recover following the tough winters. Game and Fish in 2016 lifted the restriction in five of eight hunting units, and last year doe hunting was allowed in all but one unit, 4A in the Watford City area.\n\nThat restriction remains in place for this year\u2019s season. State Wildlife Chief Jeb Williams said there are likely several reasons for the slower mule deer recovery in that area.\n\n\u201cThe farther north you go in North Dakota, the winter conditions get a little bit tougher,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s an awfully busy part of the Badlands as far as oil and gas development goes. Mule deer, generally speaking, they\u2019re sensitive.\u201d\n\nAnother factor might be that the unit overlaps with mountain lion range.\n\n\u201cWhile we don\u2019t have a large lion population, they do eat deer and can have a localized impact on deer numbers,\u201d Williams said.\n\nNorth Dakota\u2019s 16 \u00bd-day gun season for mule deer and white-tailed deer opened at noon Friday. Game and Fish approved 55,150 licenses for the 2018 season, 1 percent more than last year but up 27 percent from the recent low of 43,275 in 2015, when they bottomed out after seven straight years of decline.\n\nThe harsh winters, an oil boom and habitat loss all have cut into the state\u2019s deer population. There is still reason for optimism this fall, however, according to Williams.\n\n\u201cIt definitely appears deer numbers are pretty good in most parts of the state. Some parts of the state, the farther east you get, the numbers are lower, but the tags are lower too,\u201d he said. \u201cFor those who did draw a deer license, they\u2019re going to have a good opportunity regardless of where they\u2019re at.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Blake Nicholson on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/NicholsonBlake", "Sen.

(AP) \u2014 Facing former Florida coach Will Muschamp is the least of Dan Mullen\u2019s concerns these days.\n\nMullen and the 19th-ranked Gators have a two-game losing streak in which nobody played well, chaos at quarterback , rumors of a locker room scuffle and speculation that a few upperclassmen are considering shutting it down in preparation for the NFL draft.\n\nAs for Muschamp\u2019s return to Gainesville?\n\n\u201cI guess that\u2019s big, right?\u201d Mullen said.\n\nNot really for Florida anymore. Muschamp and his Gamecocks (5-3, 4-3 Southeastern Conference) can only pile on Saturday after all that\u2019s happened to the Gators (6-3, 4-3, No. 15 CFP) lately.\n\nFlorida has dropped two straight by a combined 40 points, including a 38-17 homecoming debacle against Missouri last week. Feleipe Franks was booed and benched in the Swamp, prompting Mullen to open up the quarterback job.\n\nBut backup Kyle Trask broke a foot practicing a trick play Wednesday and is out for the season, leaving Franks to reclaim the starting job against South Carolina.\n\nIf that wasn\u2019t enough to deal with, there were reports that Franks got into an altercation with teammates in the locker room after the loss to the Tigers and then whispers that some players, including highly touted junior defensive end Jachai Polite, is considering turning his attention toward getting ready for the draft.\n\n\u201cYou got to play for so much more,\u201d said tight end R.J.

Throw in a 20-7 loss to the Gators in 2016, and Muschamp has dropped seven of his last nine in the Swamp.\n\nSWAMP SETBACK\n\nFlorida coach Dan Mullen has as many losses at the Swamp this season as he did during his first stint in Gainesville. The Gators are 3-2 at home. Mullen went 25-2 at Florida Field as the team\u2019s offensive coordinator (2005-09).\n\nFlorida played in front of its smallest announced home crowd (80,017) since 1990 last week against Missouri, eliciting this message from Mullen:\n\n\u201cWhen we sell out the stadium, we win a championship,\u201d Mullen said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t go the other way.

There are several races too close to call in Arizona, especially the Senate race between Democratic candidate Kyrsten Sinema and Republican candidate Martha McSally. (AP Photo/Ross D. Franklin)\n\nEvery election, it takes weeks for Arizona to count its ballots. But as the Democrat in the tight U.S. Senate race there jumped into the lead in the latest results some Republicans have raised baseless allegations of fraud.\n\nThe most prominent is President Donald Trump. On Friday morning he suggested there was something sinister about the Arizona tally. Later Friday, as Republican pessimism about Rep. Martha McSally\u2019s prospects rose, Trump made an allegation with no evidence on twitter that \u201csignatures don\u2019t match\u201d in Arizona and suggested a do-over election.\n\nThere is zero evidence of anything unusual going on in the Arizona vote-counting - and no elected Republican officials in the state have cried foul. It\u2019s plausible that Democrat Kyrsten Sinema\u2019s opponent, McSally, could jump back into the lead in coming days. That wouldn\u2019t be suspicious, either. Here\u2019s why:\n\nWHY DOES ARIZONA TAKE SO LONG?\n\nBlame the fact that Arizonans like to vote early, by mail. That sounds like a contradiction, but a mailed-in ballot requires more work for Arizona elections officials.\n\nThat\u2019s because state law requires the envelope to be sealed and signed, and for elections officials to match each signature to the one on file with the voter\u2019s registration before even opening the envelope. In this election, that\u2019s about 1.7 million individual signatures that had to be confirmed, one-by-one. A total of about 2.3 million votes were cast in Arizona.\n\nThe problem comes in the final days when the ballots flood election offices. Voters can also drop off sealed mail ballots on Election Day, adding to the pile. Those ballots can\u2019t be counted that day because the elections office is busy setting up and administering in-person voting.\n\nThe state\u2019s Republican secretary of state, Michele Reagan, added another reason: election security. To ensure against voter fraud, mail ballots dropped off Election Day - which totaled 320,000 - are double-checked with votes cast at the polls to confirm no one voted twice.\n\n\u201cArizona takes elections seriously - from the poll workers to the county elections officials, and the Secretary of State\u2019s office,\u201d Reagan said in a statement Friday. \u201cEverybody is working diligently to tabulate all of the election results in a manner that Arizonans can be proud of and, most importantly, trust the results.\u201d\n\nIt normally takes more than a week to count all the ballots in Arizona. The recorder in the state\u2019s biggest county - Maricopa, where 60 percent of votes are cast - Adrian Fontes, expects the counting to be done by Nov. 15.\n\nFontes added that another bottleneck in his office is the computer system. It dates from the 1980s and is designed for a less populated county that rarely voted by mail. So it can only process up to 75,000 ballots a day. Maricopa has about 350,000 ballots that have yet to be tallied.\n\nWHY DID THE DEMOCRAT JUMP INTO A LEAD?\n\nRepublicans had been bracing themselves for Sinema to take the lead from McSally on Thursday night because the ballots processed then were more favorable to the Democrat. Early voting started on Oct. 10 and for more than a week Republicans held a clear edge in Maricopa County. But the gap began to narrow as Election Day approached and more Democrats turned in their ballots. On the final two days of early voting - Nov. 1 and Nov. 2 - Democrats turned in ballots at the same clip as Republicans, an unheard dynamic of in the traditionally GOP county.\n\nIt\u2019s those ballots that were the bulk of what was released Thursday night. Sinema had been narrowly winning Maricopa before then, as was her campaign plan - she tacked to the center to woo disaffected moderate Republicans and independents. But her margin increased when the votes from the high-Democratic voting days were tabulated Thursday and she gained 19,000 votes. That put her 2,000 over McSally, who had led from the previous count.\n\nAn hour later, Democratic-leaning Pima County, the state\u2019s second largest, released new totals that added 7,000 votes to Sinema\u2019s margin. The next major vote release should come Friday afternoon.\n\nWHAT ABOUT THIS REPUBLICAN LAWSUIT?\n\nThe GOP filed a lawsuit Wednesday night seeking to stop Maricopa and Pima counties from contacting voters after Election Day about problems with the signatures on their mail ballots. This step is part of what slows the count down and Republicans contend the two urban counties don\u2019t have the legal right to do it.\n\nBut they, Democrats and the state\u2019s counties settled the complaint Friday to essentially allow the rest of the state to follow the more lenient Maricopa and Pima standards.

The McSally campaign believes those will favor the Republican because they will be cast by older voters who like the tradition of going to the polling places.

(AP) \u2014 Top campaign organizations that helped defeat two North Carolina constitutional amendments on this week\u2019s ballot received multimillion-dollar contributions from liberal-leaning groups that aren\u2019t required to reveal who funds them.\n\nThe chief campaign finance report this fall for what\u2019s called \u201cStop Deceptive Amendments\u201d \u2014 received in the mail by state regulators on Election Day \u2014 reveals how it raised nearly $7.8 million for television commercials and other ads.\n\nOverall, pro- and anti-referendum groups raised more than $20 million combined to attempt to sway public opinion on the six ballot questions, according to campaign reports. Voters approved four of the questions legislative Republicans put on the ballot but soundly rejected two that would have swung power over judicial vacancy and election board appointments from Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper to the legislature.\n\nTwo-thirds of the money collected by \u201cStop Deceptive Amendments\u201d came from a pair of Washington-based entities that support liberal causes. They were formed under parts of the federal tax law as social-welfare groups, so they don\u2019t have to disclose the identities of donors.\n\nThe Sixteen Thirty Fund gave $3.5 million and the State Engagement Fund gave $1.65 million, according to the Stop Deceptive Amendments pre-election report.\n\nThis year, the Sixteen Thirty Fund also gave millions to support a Michigan referendum to create an independent redistricting commission and a minimum wage increase referendum in Missouri. Both of those questions passed Tuesday.\n\nThe fund \u201csupports campaigns that fight to protect democracy,\u201d Sixteen Thirty Fund spokeswoman Beth Kanter said in an email Friday, calling the Stop Deceptive Amendments effort a campaign \u201cthat aimed to protect checks and balances and prevent partisan politics from being permanently entrenched in the North Carolina state constitution.\u201d\n\nThe State Engagement Fund\u2019s annual federal tax filing in 2016 showed it gave millions combined that year to left-leaning groups for voter education and get-out-the-vote activities, as well as community organizing. The fund\u2019s tax filing lists Scott Anderson, the former executive director of the North Carolina Association of Educators, as one of its leaders. Anderson didn\u2019t return a phone call Friday seeing comment.\n\nSeparately, the State Engagement Fund gave $3.3 million this year to North Carolina Citizens for Protecting Our Schools, which ran television ads opposing an amendment that lowered the state\u2019s income tax rate cap from 10 percent to 7 percent. That amendment passed, as did questions requiring photo identification to vote in person, creating the right to hunt and fish and expanding the rights of crime victims.\n\nWhile Stop Deceptive Amendments opposed all six amendments, their ads focused primarily on the two that failed. The commercials highlighted the opposition to the pair by all living former Republican and Democratic governors.\n\nMarsy\u2019s Law for NC, which ran ads supporting the crime victims\u2019 amendment, reported receiving over $7.9 million. All of the money came from the national Marsy\u2019s Law group, which is bankrolled by California tech company founder Henry Nicholas. Similar victims\u2019 amendments in five other states passed Tuesday, with Marsy\u2019s Law group backing.\n\nA pro-voter ID political committee reported raising over $900,000 for ads that linked the voter ID question to state Senate candidates. Nearly all of \u201cNC Voter ID\u201d group money came from the Republican State Leadership Committee, which backs GOP candidates in the states. The RSLC reveals its nationwide donors, which includes scores of corporations.\n\nPre-election campaign finance reports had to be filed electronically or postmarked by Oct. 29. \u201cStop Deceptive Amendments\u201d revealed last week how much money it had raised.

Virginia faces Liberty on Saturday. (AP Photo/Mark Humphrey, File)\n\nVirginia is stepping out conference play this weekend when the Cavaliers host Liberty.\n\nIt\u2019s a scheduling oddity for Virginia, which is in contention for the ACC\u2019s Coastal Division title and the Cavaliers say they will not look past the Flames on Saturday.\n\n\u201cJust the next-week mentality,\u201d linebacker and tri-captain Chris Peace said of digesting a loss to Pittsburgh and moving forward. \u201cAfter the NC State loss, I was just like, \u2018OK, it happened. You\u2019re never going to get it back. Just focus on the next week. That\u2019s all you can do.\u2019 And I pointed out, we\u2019re not too ahead from last year. We\u2019re 6-3, just like we were last year at one point. Now, however, we want to finish.\u201d\n\nThe Cavaliers (6-3) and Liberty (4-4) have never met on the football field, but Virginia coach Bronco Mendenhall said his team has plenty to work on both sides of the ball with the Flames bringing an explosive offense to Scott Stadium.\n\n\u201cWhat stands out is production,\u201d he said. \u201cLiberty is ninth nationally in throwing the football, I think 26th in scoring offense, and so the statistics jump out. Not hard to see on film that they have some talented players, a nice scheme design and are very clear about what their identity is and the speed in which they want to do it.\u201d\n\nVirginia, meanwhile, got away from what it wants to do in a 23-13 loss to Pittsburgh. The Panthers contained Bryce Perkins and sacked him five times, which highlighted the need to be less reliant on the quarterback.\n\n\u201cOur run game can\u2019t just be Bryce on zone read pull and then quarterback scramble,\u201d Mendenhall said of Perkins, the team\u2019s No. 2 rusher. \u201cThat can\u2019t be the majority of the yards. That can be complementary, but it has to come off of run game execution off our core plays. Right now it\u2019s shifting in reverse order.\u201d\n\nGetting it fixed against the Flames should be less difficult. While they are scoring 36.9 points per game, they also are allowing 38.2 points per game, and opponents have run for an average of 238 yards against them.\n\nLiberty coach Turner Gill expects Perkins and Co. to offer a significant challenge.\n\n\u201cHe starts it off,\u201d Gill said of Perkins. \u201cVery, very talented dual threat guy. ... He makes a lot of things happen with his legs as he\u2019s making throws and also, he can just take off running. He breaks a lot of tackles.\u201d\n\nLast week, they allowed 777 yards in a 62-59 triple-overtime loss to Massachusetts.\n\nHere are some other things to watch when Liberty visits Virginia:\n\nTRIPLE OPTIONS\n\nPerkins\u2019 running ability is supposed to open things up for tailback Jordan Ellis, wide receiver Olamide Zaccheaus and others, but none of that happened against Pitt. Ellis carried just 10 times (for 46 yards) and the fleet-footed Zaccheaus, the school\u2019s career receptions leader, touched the ball only five times all game.\n\nFOCUS\n\nMendenhall said this week that the rare late non-conference game can present a challenge, and Virginia has seemingly overcome the focus issues that have affected recent teams. Doing it again against the Flames, and preparing to close the season on the road at Georgia Tech and Virginia Tech, will show further growth.\n\nRECORD WATCH\n\nJunior quarterback Stephen Calvert has 62 career touchdown passes, three shy of breaking Robby Justino\u2019s career record at the school. He\u2019s also one of just three FBS juniors with over 7,000 passing yards and 60 TD throws and has 46 completions for 20 yards or more this season, including 20 to Antonio Gandy-Golden (51 catches, 9 TDs).\n\nSACK EXCHANGE\n\nBoth programs have defensive players who specialize in getting to the quarterback. Virginia linebacker Chris Peace has six sacks this season, and Liberty DE Jessie Lemonier has nine, including six in the last two games.\n\nSEND \u2019EM OUT RIGHT\n\nMendenhall hopes the surge in fan support Virginia has seen this season continues.\n\n\u201cI would love to have a great outing at home to finish this season,\u201d he said. \u201cVery appreciative of our fans, and a noticeably different feeling in Scott Stadium this year to me in terms of the energy, the support, the student section. There is a noticeable difference. For me to notice it on the sideline is pretty significant.\u201d\n\nVirginia will honor 27 fourth-, fifth- and sixth year players in Senior Day ceremonies prior to the game.\n\n___\n\nFor more AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "PHOENIX (AP) \u2014 A man who formerly served as treasurer for the Pine-Strawberry Water Improvement District has pleaded guilty to fraud, theft and conflict of interest charges in connection with dealings with the district and the Gila County Mounted Posse.\n\nThe state Attorney General\u2019s Office says Michael Scott Greer faces between 1\u00bd and 2\u00bd years in prison and will pay a fine of $65,865 in addition to already paying restitution of $42,000 before he pleaded guilty Wednesday.\n\nThe office says Greer failed to disclose he had financial interests in two vendors awarded contracts by the water district for installation and maintenance of 13 wells.\n\nIt also says Greer falsely reported account balances for the posse after using $38,706 of posse money to cover personal expenses.\n\nHe is scheduled to be sentenced Jan. 14.", "Protesters march from Cal Anderson Park to the Federal Building downtown in Seattle, in support of special counsel Robert Mueller and against President Donald Trump's appointment this week of acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, Thursday, Nov. 8, 2018.

The high court considers the case of Grady. (New Hanover County Sheriff's Office via AP)\n\nRALEIGH, N.C. (AP) \u2014 North Carolina\u2019s Supreme Court is re-evaluating whether forcing sex offenders to be perpetually tracked by GPS-linked devices, sometimes for the rest of their lives, is justified or a Constitution-violating unreasonable search.\n\nThe state\u2019s highest court next month takes up the case of repeat sex offender Torrey Grady. It comes three years after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in his case that mandating GPS ankle monitors for ex-cons is a serious privacy concern.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s different possible outcomes of the case. One is that it\u2019s never reasonable at all. Another is that it\u2019s reasonable, maybe while the person is still on post-release supervision\u201d for five years after prison release, said James Markham, a professor who focuses on criminal law at the University of North Carolina\u2019s School of Government. \u201cAnother possibility is that it\u2019s reasonable for the rest of their life.\u201d\n\nGrady took his case to the nation\u2019s top court arguing that having his movements forever monitored violated his constitutional protection against unreasonable searches. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that attaching a device to a person\u2019s body in order to track their movements qualifies as a \u201csearch\u201d and a question of constitutional rights. But the decision left it up to states to decide whether imposed monitoring is reasonable, and for how long.\n\nStates are still at work answering that question, with Michigan and Wisconsin among the handful that have considered whether long-term electronic monitoring\u2019s public benefit outweighs the privacy rights of the sex offender. Both decided it constituted a reasonable search. Delaware\u2019s Supreme Court last year rejected a challenge from the American Civil Liberties Union to a law requiring GPS monitoring of certain sex offenders complained the ankle bracelets were embarrassing, sometimes painful and an invasion of privacy.\n\nNorth Carolina\u2019s Supreme Court will consider Grady\u2019s case on Dec. 3 as well as a second challenging the GPS tracking ordered for Darren Gentle. The combination would give the justices \u201can opportunity to compare and contrast those different situations,\u201d Markham said.\n\nGentile was convicted in Randolph County in 2016 of violently raping a 25-year-old woman who was seven months pregnant and with whom he\u2019d been taking drugs, according to state attorneys. He is serving a 41-year prison sentence, but is arguing he shouldn\u2019t have been ordered into post-release GPS monitoring because the trial judge didn\u2019t review whether that was reasonable.\n\nGrady, 40, returned to prison in April after failing to register as a sex offender, according to state prison records. He was convicted of a sexual offense in 1997 when he was 17, and was convicted in 2007 of taking indecent liberties with a minor who was 15, according to the state sex offender registry.\n\nHis attorneys argue that after paying his debt to society in prison, Grady and other sex offenders do not give up their privacy rights even though laws restrict where they can live and travel, for example barring visits to school grounds.\n\nA divided panel of North Carolina\u2019s second-highest court in May reversed a trial judge that ordered Grady enrolled for life in satellite-based monitoring, saying they saw no studies showing tracking prevented future crimes.\n\n\u201cThe State failed to present any evidence of its need to monitor defendant, or the procedures actually used to conduct such monitoring in unsupervised cases.

(AP Photo/Eugene Tanner)\n\nLOGAN, Utah (AP) \u2014 Slowing down the blistering pace of Utah State\u2019s offense has become a virtually impossible task for nearly every opponent that\u2019s faced the Aggies this season.\n\nThe No. 14 Aggies enter their regular-season home finale against San Jose State on Saturday entrenched among the nation\u2019s best teams at finding the end zone.\n\nUtah State (8-1, 5-0 Mountain West) ranks second nationally in scoring offense (50.1 points per game), trailing only Alabama, and 14th in total offense (4,371 yards). The Aggies also have a knack for piling up points and yards fast. They rank second among FBS teams with 19 scoring drives under a minute.\n\n\u201cWhat we do on offense is very hard to replicate during the week in practice for scout teams,\u201d Utah State coach Matt Wells said. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely hard at the pace that we\u2019re playing.\u201d\n\nSophomore quarterback Jordan Love ranks among the top 30 nationally in passing efficiency (156.4), completion percentage (.651), and passing touchdowns (19). He has thrown for 2,185 yards in nine games.\n\nUtah State is averaging 6.68 yards per play \u2014 which ranks 14th nationally. Twenty different players have scored a touchdown this season for the Aggies.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t ever sit around and imagine scoring this many points,\u201d Wells said. \u201cWe\u2019re in a good rhythm, our guys are very confident in what we\u2019re doing and again, it goes back to our philosophy. It\u2019s what we do and how we do it.\u201d\n\nUtah State will have a chance to rewrite some school records against the Spartans.\n\nThe Aggies have scored 58 touchdowns this season and need three more to surpass the school record of 60 set in 2011. With 451 points, they also need only four more points to top the school record of 454 points scored in 2012.\n\nStrong first quarter starts have helped Utah State fill up the stat sheet. The Aggies have led at the end of the first quarter in all nine games this season and have outscored opponents 138-32 in the first 15 minutes.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re outstanding on defense,\u201d San Jose State coach Brent Brennan said. \u201cTheir quarterback is playing at a really high level. They\u2019re very good in the kicking game. It really is the most complete team that we\u2019ve played this year.\u201d\n\nThe Spartans (1-8, 1-4 Mountain West) could be in for a long afternoon trying to keep up with Utah State.\n\nSan Jose State ranks among the bottom 20 FBS teams in scoring defense (36.1 points per game) and total defense (462.1 yards per game). The Spartans have had equal trouble generating offense, averaging just 22.9 points and 324.1 yards per contest to rank near the bottom of the Mountain West in both categories.\n\nOther things to note going into this week\u2019s game between San Jose State and Utah State:\n\nLOVE EXPECTED BACK: Utah State suffered a scare when Love did not play the final two series of the first half or the entire second half of last week\u2019s 56-17 win over Hawaii after he took a knee to the helmet. Wells said he has no concerns about Love\u2019s health and expects that he\u2019ll be ready to go Saturday. Love led the Aggies to touchdowns on their first four drives and finished with 127 yards and a touchdown on 10-of-13 passing.\n\nTHE 100 CLUB: Three different San Jose State receivers have a shot at reaching 100 career receptions on Saturday. Justin Holmes enters the game with 99 receptions, Tre Huntley has 95 and Josh Oliver has 91. All three players are seniors. Oliver is the team\u2019s leading receiver this season with 580 yards on 49 catches.\n\nSNAGGING TAKEAWAYS: A tough defense is making Utah State\u2019s offense feel even more formidable by creating good field position. The Aggies have forced 23 turnovers (14 interceptions, 9 fumbles) in nine games. They lead the Mountain West and rank second nationally behind Georgia Southern in the category. Utah State is also second nationally with four defensive touchdowns.\n\nGETTING KICKS: San Jose State kicker Bryce Crawford is the only FBS player to rank in the top 30 nationally in field goals made per game and punting average. The senior has made seven straight field goals and averages 1.4 makes per game. He is averaging 43.96 yards per punt.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "LINCOLN, Neb.

Belknap is one of the highest performing elementary schools in Utah and is a Title 1 school. (Scott G Winterton/The Deseret News via AP)\n\nBEAVER, Utah (AP) \u2014 Principal Brad Harris, half-apologizing, notes the sign on the wall that declares Belknap Elementary School as a Blue Ribbon School by the U.S. Department of Education.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. Department of Education hasn\u2019t sent us our signs yet so we made our own,\u201d Harris said.\n\nGive Harris his due. The former Belknap Elementary teacher turned principal is justifiably proud of the school\u2019s designation as one of the top-performing elementary schools in the state, if not the nation.\n\nBelknap, along with Peruvian Park Elementary School in Sandy and Salt Lake\u2019s Hawthorne Elementary School, were recently designated as \u201cexemplary high performing schools,\u201d by the Education Department\u2019s now 36-year-old national recognition program.\n\nBut unlike Peruvian Park and Hawthorne, which are magnet schools in Salt Lake County, Belknap is a rural Title I school that serves about 480 students, including 57 percent who are economically disadvantaged. The school also serves a growing number of English language learners.\n\nAlthough small and rural, Belknap Elementary School sets the pace for standardized test scores statewide, something Beaver County School District Superintendent Ray Terry attributes to the school\u2019s deep commitment to learning, whether it\u2019s a kindergartener mastering the fundamentals of reading or veteran teachers mentoring new hires.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a comprehensive, joint effort we\u2019ve developed over the years. The last four years, they\u2019ve consistently gotten better and better,\u201d Terry said.\n\nIn the most recent SAGE end-of-level test results Elementary posted some of the highest scores in the state.\n\nSeventy-three percent of Belknap students were proficient in math in 2018, compared to the statewide average of 46 percent. In language arts, 71 percent of Belknap students were proficient, compared to the state average of 45 percent. Sixty-six percent of Belknap\u2019s students were proficient in science while statewide, an average of 47 percent met the mark.\n\nNot only do Belknap Elementary\u2019s scores far exceed state averages, they have grown year to year the past four years, with the exception of a slight dip in science proficiency in 2018.\n\nTerry said maintaining growth is a matter of stubborn pride and a commitment by each teacher that \u201cthey\u2019re not going to be one that causes us to go backward.\u201d\n\nWhen the district hires new educators and paraprofessionals, they are made aware of the district\u2019s high expectations.\n\nBut Beaver County School District provides new hires with supports to help them be successful, Terry said.\n\n\u201cWe dedicate 3 percent of our budget to the improvement of our teachers. We have a new teacher program for three years. They get support and training from mentor teachers because we want them to stay but also because we also want them to get better. By the time they\u2019ve reached their fourth year, we\u2019re feeling really confident we\u2019ve got the workings of a master teacher,\u201d he said.\n\nThere\u2019s no secret recipe to the school\u2019s success, said literacy specialist LaRayne Brown. The school relies heavily on data to track students, teaches its research-backed curriculum to fidelity and employs highly trained paraprofessionals who work with higher-performing students while certified teachers work with students who are struggling.\n\n\u201cThat consistency is so important,\u201d Brown said.\n\nEvery child in Belknap\u2019s lower grades reads aloud to a teacher or paraprofessional daily so educators have constant feedback how each child is performing.\n\nAt the end of the school day, each child takes a book home selected for them from the school\u2019s \u201cleveled\u201d library. They\u2019re expected to read the book to a parent and return with a signed slip from a parent or guardian to confirm they\u2019ve done so.\n\nClasses that reach their goals are rewarded with pizza and root beer float parties, Brown says. Students who exhibit good citizenship are invited to eat with Harris in the \u201cPrincipal\u2019s Club.\n\nAll educators meet regularly \u2014 if not daily \u2014 in professional learning communities to share the best teaching practices and collaborate on strategies to help students who are struggling, Harris said.\n\n\u201cTeachers are constantly talking about every student on the grade level. They care about the whole child,\u201d Harris said.\n\nMany of Belknap Elementary\u2019s strategies could be replicated elsewhere, but the architecture of the school unquestionably helps teachers and paraprofessionals instruct in small groups. The school has large classrooms and each wing has a common area where entire grades can gather for group activities, which enables grade-level educators to teach the entire grade in science or social studies, for instance.\n\nBelknap integrates technology into its learning with two computer labs used by all grade levels. Each child grades 3-6 takes home a Chromebook to do homework, study and conduct research. The laptops use school filters to help ensure students cannot access inappropriate materials, Harris said.\n\nThe school has a steady stream of visitors who want to know what the school is doing to has set the pace for other elementary schools. This past week, Gov. Gary Herbert paid a visit.\n\nSome things can\u2019t be duplicated, such as Beaver\u2019s sense of community.\n\nIn a town of 3,000, educators invariably run into students and their parents at the grocery store, Terry said.\n\nThey may attend the same church with the families in the school district, coach their children in sports or lead their scout groups.\n\n\u201cA lot of times they\u2019re asking, \u2018Are you coming to my game on Saturday?\u2019 Every time you go, you always want to make sure that they saw you (and tell them) \u2018Nice job\u2019 and that sort of thing. That\u2019s the sense of community right there,\u201d Harris said.\n\nWhile Belknap Elementary is riding an upward trajectory, it went through a period of struggle that forced the district to re-evaluate its teaching practices, curriculum and professional development.\n\nWhen the state moved to Student Assessment of Growth and Excellence or SAGE testing, one classroom had a score indicating just 9 percent of students were proficient.\n\n\u201cWe knew we could do better. We didn\u2019t feel like we had done justice to our students,\u201d Brown said.\n\nIt marked the beginning of the district\u2019s instructional coaching \u201cto help teachers be the best they can be,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe actually took one teacher who scored a nine up to a 63 the next year,\u201d Brown said. She credits the teacher for working hard to update and improve her teaching methods. She retired the following year but it was important for her, and her students, that she left on a high note, Brown said.\n\nNo question, much of Belknap\u2019s success is chronicled in test score data. But there are also successes that assessments don\u2019t measure.\n\nLike the father of one formerly struggling student who stood outside his classroom, observing his son engaged in learning.\n\n\u201cHe just stood in the hall. He could not even talk. He just sobbed. He said, \u2018You have changed my son\u2019s life, not just his academics but his life because now he comes home and he feels good about himself and he wants to learn. He gets in and does his homework.\u2019\n\n\u201cHe can read and he isn\u2019t still quite to grade level but you go in and he\u2019s feeling success. He is. He\u2019s growing and achieving. That\u2019s our real paycheck, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Brown said.\n\nTerry said Minersville Elementary also performs well above the state average on standardized test scores.\n\nOne of the district\u2019s goals is getting its high school on a similar track, Terry said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not there yet. It\u2019s a challenge, but it\u2019s a fun one,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Deseret News, http://www.deseretnews.com", "FILE - In this Oct. 28, 2018, file photo, Minnesota Vikings safety Harrison Smith (22) celebrates with teammates after intercepting a pass against the New Orleans Saints during an NFL football game in Minneapolis.

No player in the NFL hit both of those marks over the entire 2017 season.\n\n\u201cWith Earl Thomas out for the year, it\u2019s easy to see Smith as the top safety in the league.\u201d\n\nWho is the top safety in the NFL?

Smith received 97 points in a 10-points-to-one-point system, garnering eight of 10 first-place votes. He finished second on one ballot and third on the other to easily outdistance the New York Giants\u2019 Landon Collins, who had 69 points.\n\n\u201cNot only is Smith the clear leader at this position, particularly with his skills in coverage,\u201d said New York-based writer Barry Wilner, \u201cbut he\u2019s probably Minnesota\u2019s most valuable defensive player.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s saying a lot, particularly with a team that includes defensive end Danielle Hunter, who leads the NFL with 11\u00bd sacks.\n\n\u201cSmith is an elite pass defender who can bat away a throw or pick off a pass on one play, then sack the QB on the next,\u201d Washington-based Howard Fendrich said.\n\nSmith finished second in last year\u2019s voting, with Thomas winning. The injured Seahawks star, who\u2019s out for the season with a broken left leg, had 59 points \u2014 and received one first-place vote, from Bay Area-based Josh Dubow \u2014 to finish third this year.\n\n\u201cThomas is still the benchmark at safety despite a season-ending injury,\u201d Dubow said.\n\nThere were 28 players who received at least one vote, but Smith and Collins were the only safeties to appear on all 10 ballots.\n\nCollins jumped up two spots after finishing fourth last year. He doesn\u2019t have any interceptions yet this season, but has firmly established himself as one of the best at his position.\n\n\u201cYeah, he\u2019s on a team with one win (entering Week 10), but Collins is strong tackler and pass defender,\u201d New York-based Simmi Buttar said.\n\nTennessee\u2019s Kevin Byard is fourth with 54 points, but received the other first-place vote from Nashville-based Teresa M. Walker.\n\n\u201cByard is just getting better with every game,\u201d Walker said, \u201cand he was pretty good in 2017 when he was an All-Pro who tied for the league lead with eight interceptions and led the NFL with 10 takeaways.\u201d\n\nByard has two interceptions this season, and caused quite a stir with his star turn on his most recent pick. After intercepting Dak Prescott\u2019s pass Monday night in Tennessee\u2019s 28-14 victory at Dallas, Byard ran to the 50-yard line at AT&T Stadium and danced with his teammates on the Cowboys\u2019 star logo.\n\n\u201cHe should\u2019ve left the Cowboys star stomp to Terrell Owens,\u201d said Philadelphia-based Rob Maaddi. \u201cBut Byard is a ball magnet and no longer an unknown around the league, even to Deion Sanders.\u201d\n\nSanders and Byard got into a Twitter feud in the offseason about who the league\u2019s top safety is.

Swearinger, who had 36 points.\n\n\u201cSwearinger does everything well, from coverage to run support to rushing the passer,\u201d said Dubow, who had him ranked second on his ballot.\n\nThe Jets\u2019 Jamal Adams (24 points), Los Angeles Chargers rookie Derwin James (21), Baltimore\u2019s Eric Weddle (20) and Kansas City\u2019s Eric Berry (19) rounded out the top 10.\n\nBerry appeared on six ballots despite having not played since last year\u2019s season opener.\n\n\u201cHe might be No. 1 if he had played a down this season,\u201d Fendrich said. \u201cIf he recovers enough from the heel injury that has kept him out for every game so far, he could be a big factor in the playoffs for the Chiefs.\u201d\n\n___\n\nThe rankings:\n\n1.

If convicted of all charges in the indictment, Sayoc would face a mandatory life prison sentence.\n\nAuthorities said he sent improvised explosive devices to numerous Democrats, critics of Trump and CNN. The scare heightened tensions before the crucial midterm elections, but he was arrested within days.\n\nProsecutors followed through on a promise to upgrade the charges with an indictment that led with five counts alleging use of a weapon of mass destruction. The document said he mailed 16 improvised explosive devices though the U.S. mail to victims across the country.\n\nThe charges said he aimed to \u201ckill, injure and intimidate an individual and unlawfully to damage and destroy a building, vehicle, and other real and person property.\u201d\n\nNone of the devices \u2014 some of which arrived at New York addresses \u2014 exploded.\n\nA message left with Sayoc\u2019s lawyer was not immediately returned.\n\nIn a release, U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S.

Kamala Harris and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker. Packages were also mailed to CNN in New York and Atlanta.\n\nProsecutors say evidence against Sayoc includes DNA linking him to 10 of the explosive devices and fingerprints on two of them.\n\nThe case was randomly assigned to U.S. District Judge Jed S.

Enrollees must spend 80 hours a month on work or approved activities \u2014 and they must report it online to the state. Those who fail to comply for three months during a year lose their coverage and are barred from re-enrolling for the rest of the year.\n\nThe commission, which was created by Congress to make policy recommendations for low-income health care programs, is calling for a pause in disenrollment to modify the program.\n\nPenny Thompson, chairman of the commission, wrote in her letter that the requirement to report through a website \u201cmay be challenging for beneficiaries given limited internet access in the state and the multi-stage process for establishing an account and entering information.\u201d She also said enrollees may need help finding and keeping a job.\n\nOnly about 1,530 enrollees met the requirement in September by reporting their hours, while about 16,535 failed to report any activities.\n\nArkansas Medicaid Director Dawn Stehle said last month that the commission\u2019s \u201cattempt to establish itself as a monitor over individual state Medicaid programs is a new and slippery path that should be reconsidered.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said the agency and the Health and Human Services department had no comment on the commission\u2019s letter.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, http://www.arkansasonline.com", "BOONVILLE, Ind.

Two coaching staffs. A handful of big-time upsets that hinted at a turnaround. Just as many baffling losses that have ultimately prevented it from happening.\n\nStill, the burly fullback hasn\u2019t seen this: it\u2019s November and the Panthers are in first place in the ACC\u2019s Coastal Division heading into a visit from Virginia Tech. Pitt\u2019s first trip to a conference title game is within reach, an achievement that Aston and the rest of the 19 seniors who will play their final game at Heinz Field on Saturday know would leave a tangible lasting legacy.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t been in this position this late in the season before,\u201d Aston said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty late in the season, we control our own destiny. We\u2019ve just got to win.\u201d\n\nSomething the Panthers (5-4, 4-1) have managed to do with regularity over the last month, reviving what threatened to be a lost season. Pitt has won three of four \u2014 the lone setback a narrow 19-14 nonconference loss to unbeaten Notre Dame on the road \u2014 to move into the driver\u2019s seat in the typically unwieldy Coastal, which could have its sixth different champion in as many years.\n\n\u201cI felt like we put our mind to it, this team can do a lot of different things,\u201d defensive end DeWayne Hendrix said. \u201cJust us going through adversity as a team, losing games that we weren\u2019t supposed to and now we\u2019re finally starting to get into a groove. We always knew we should be winning those games. We just didn\u2019t know when it was going to happen.\u201d\n\nThis might be the year. Emphasis on might. The Panthers, however, are wary. As promising as the last month has been, it can come undone very quickly. A team built on running the ball and defense understands it has little margin for error. Still, they like their chances.\n\n\u201cA lot of people doubted us,\u201d Hendrix said. \u201cPeople are going to doubt you when you\u2019re losing but when you\u2019re winning, they\u2019re going to jump on the bandwagon. We know how good we can be but we can\u2019t be sidetracked on that. We\u2019ve got to go out and grind each week just like everybody else.\u201d\n\nSomething Virginia Tech (4-4, 3-2) has been unable to do during a stretch in which it has dropped three of four. Still, the Hokies can revive their own chances at capturing the Coastal \u2014 and salvaging an uneven year \u2014 by beating the Panthers for the third straight time.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not our job to be frustrated, it\u2019s our job to try to fix, coach and mentor,\u201d Virginia Tech coach Justin Fuente said. \u201cContinuing to try to push these guys forward so that they can execute on a more consistent basis so that as a team we have a chance to have more consistent play against very good people.\u201d\n\nVIVID MEMORY\n\nVirginia Tech edged Pitt 20-14 in Blacksburg last season thanks to a dramatic goal-line stand in which the Hokies stopped Pitt on four shots from inside the Virginia Tech 5 in the final minute. The loss ultimately cost the Panthers a shot at a bowl game and the near miss has come up frequently over the last 12 months.\n\n\u201cWe all know what happened,\u201d Pitt sophomore quarterback Kenny Pickett said. \u201cWe remember it clearly. It\u2019s extra motivation this week.\u201d\n\nROAD WARRIORS\n\nThe Hokies have been a bit of an erratic mess this season thanks in large part to an inability to get things done at Lane Stadium. Virginia Tech is just 1-3 at home \u2014 including 0-2 in the league \u2014 but has been solid on the road. The Hokies have won four straight ACC road games dating to a victory at Virginia in the 2017 season finale. Quarterback Ryan Willis has been a little more productive away from Lane Stadium. His road quarterback rating of 147.3 is a tick above what he puts up at home (134.9).\n\nTRYING THIS AGAIN\n\nIn Boston College last week, the Hokies played the team whose style most resembles the very physical approach Pittsburgh takes offensively and allowed 219 yards rushing. That came a week after they allowed 465 to Georgia Tech. With perhaps his youngest defense ever, Hokies defensive coordinator Bud Foster hopes having played the Eagles will help. \u201cYeah, they\u2019re going to be similar,\u201d he said. \u201cBig and physical up front. Big, physical, athletic tailbacks. They\u2019re going to be very similar in a lot of ways.

Now coach David Cutcliffe wants a strong finish to the regular season.\n\nThe Blue Devils host rival North Carolina in Durham on Saturday knowing they\u2019re headed to a postseason game. But they haven\u2019t won two straight games since September, either.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t afford to be up and down,\u201d Cutcliffe said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to finish this thing out. November needs to be special for us.\u201d\n\nDuke (6-3, 2-3 Atlantic Coast Conference) can match its win total for last season, which ended with a win against Northern Illinois in the Quick Lane Bowl. Beating the Tar Heels would also ensure the program\u2019s fifth winning season in six years, the first time the program\u2019s done that since the 1960s.\n\nAnd they\u2019re playing to keep the Victory Bell presented to the winner of the annual instate rivalry. Duke has won the past two meetings and four of the past six since Larry Fedora took over at UNC.\n\nThe Blue Devils are coming off a road win against Miami, and still have a cross-divisional game at No. 2 Clemson next week followed by the regular-season finale at home against Wake Forest on Nov. 24.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t get hoggish,\u201d Cutcliffe said. \u201cI do know how to count to six (wins for bowl eligibility). That\u2019s important. But at the same time, this team should be focused on what lies ahead potentially. . I know that our seniors and upperclassmen in general expect more from this team and themselves.\u201d\n\nThings have been much tougher for the Tar Heels (1-7, 1-5), who have lost several close games and are headed for a second straight bowl-less finish. UNC is in the midst of a two-year slide that has seen the Tar Heels lose 19 of 24 games since November 2016, a stretch that began with a loss at Duke.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely not easy,\u201d UNC quarterback Nathan Elliott said of staying positive. \u201cBut these guys in this locker room and these coaches have done a great job of keeping everyone focused and moving forward.\u201d\n\nHere are some other things to know about Saturday\u2019s UNC-Duke game:\n\nCLOSE LOSSES\n\nThe close losses have piled up for the Tar Heels, including a mistake-filled home game to Virginia Tech and a double-overtime loss at No. 13 Syracuse. Fedora has said his team is \u201cextremely close\u201d to coming up with the play or two needed to win a game.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s making sure they know that every play could be the difference in the game,\u201d Fedora said. \u201cThat\u2019s the way you have to play the game.\u201d\n\nNO OVERLOOKING\n\nDuke receiver Johnathan Lloyd said the Blue Devils won\u2019t expect an easy game despite UNC\u2019s record. Besides, there\u2019s a recent reminder from two years ago when the Tar Heels arrived with a No. 15 national ranking to face a Duke team that hadn\u2019t won an ACC game \u2014 and lost.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re better than 1-7,\u201d Lloyd said. \u201cYou turn on the tape, they\u2019re not a bad football team. They\u2019ve had some breaks go against them. . We have to come out and play, and if we don\u2019t, we can get beat.\u201d\n\nRED-ZONE STOPS\n\nDuke leads the ACC in red-zone defense, allowing opponents to score on 17 of 24 trips inside the 20-yard line (nearly 71 percent). Thirteen of those scores have been touchdowns, with only two through the air.\n\nTURNOVER PROBLEMS\n\nWhen asked recently what was the biggest factor in UNC\u2019s two-year slide, Fedora pointed to turnovers and failing to take care of the football.\n\nThe Tar Heels rank near the bottom of the Bowl Subdivision ranks in turnover margin at minus-1 per game, which is 13th in the 14-team ACC. Last weekend\u2019s loss to Georgia Tech offered an example of how much it has hindered the Tar Heels; they rallied from 18 down in the third quarter to tie the game, only to have Elliott throw two fourth-quarter interceptions as the Yellow Jackets went on to win.\n\nThey can\u2019t keep repeating those same mistakes if they want to win another ACC game.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: http://apnews.com/collegefootball and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\n___\n\nFollow Aaron Beard on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/aaronbeardap", "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 A ring of savvy car thieves in New York exploited a bureaucratic weakness by registering many of their ripped-off Lamborghinis and Range Rovers in South Dakota, a state that lets people register out-of-state vehicles by mail and wasn\u2019t thoroughly checking to see if they were stolen, the FBI said.\n\nFederal prosecutors in New York brought federal conspiracy charges against seven people this week, blaming them for the thefts of 60 vehicles.\n\nThe ring registered many of the stolen cars in South Dakota, a state the FBI said conducted \u201cfewer or no checks\u201d to confirm lawful ownership of registered vehicles compared to other states.\n\nThe South Dakota Division of Motor Vehicles did not respond to an email request for comment Friday.

If you\u2019re a veteran with student debt, you have repayment rights unique to military service members that can keep you on track and out of default. (AP Photo/Ted S. Warren, File)\n\nIf you\u2019re a veteran with student debt, you have repayment rights unique to military service members that can keep you on track and out of default.\n\nFederal student loan default occurs after nine months without a payment. Late notices turn into collection calls, and your creditor - the government - can take you to court and even garnish your paycheck. Once you default, you\u2019ll no longer qualify for repayment plans that could make payments manageable.\n\nUnderstanding your options can help reduce the risk of default.\n\nHOW VETERANS END UP WITH STUDENT DEBT\n\n\u201cSome student are unsure how to fully access their benefits or what programs they\u2019re eligible for \u2014 that could lead them to borrow and leave benefits on the table,\u201d says Colleen Campbell, associate director for postsecondary education at the Center for American Progress, a public policy think tank.\n\nVeterans often take out student loans after exhausting their Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits , which cover tuition and fees and include a monthly housing allowance and money for books. Not everyone uses their GI Bill benefits, and some don\u2019t qualify for 100 percent tuition coverage.\n\nAdditionally, veterans borrow more frequently when attending for-profit schools than public colleges, according to an analysis by Veterans Education Success, a nonprofit that provides free legal assistance to student veterans.\n\nWHY VETERANS ARE MORE VULNERABLE TO DEFAULT\n\nVeterans tend to be older than traditional undergraduates and are likelier to be employed while in school, says Kathy Payea, senior research fellow with Veterans Education Success. They also may be supporting families.\n\nThese conditions can make it harder for veteran students to finish college on time. Students who fall below half-time attendance status have to start paying back their loans.\n\nAdditionally, due to the factors above, some veterans may be attracted to for-profit online college programs that often don\u2019t deliver, Payea says.\n\nVeteran borrowers often default after attending for-profit college programs: One-third of a cohort of student veterans who enrolled in for-profit schools in 2003-04 defaulted on their student loans in the 12 years after, according to an analysis of federal data by Veterans Education Success.\n\nIf you\u2019re facing repayment challenges, here\u2019s how to ease the burden.\n\nGET HELP WITH REPAYMENT\n\nAll federal student loan borrowers have access to repayment options beyond the standard 10-year plan. Income-driven repayment, for example, caps your monthly payment at a portion of your income and extends the length of repayment.\n\nCurrent service members also may get repayment help through branch-specific repayment programs or through the Department of Defense. The Navy, for example, offers an incentive that pays off up to $65,000 of a sailor\u2019s federal student loans in their first three years of active-duty service.\n\nAsk your designated military personnel officer to find out how to access these benefits.\n\nPAUSE LOAN PAYMENTS\n\nMilitary deferment allows borrowers to postpone loan repayment while on active duty and immediately after. This applies to federal and private loans.\n\nIn addition to military deferment, all borrowers can get in-school deferment and forbearance in case of financial hardship. Contact your lender or servicer to learn how.\n\nGET LOAN FORGIVENESS\n\nMilitary service can qualify federal loan borrowers for Public Service Loan Forgiveness, which will forgive the remainder of your loan balance after 120 qualifying payments. You must be in the military or working in the public sector while making each payment.\n\nBorrowers who are totally and permanently disabled can have their loans discharged. The Department of Education identifies those who may be eligible for loan discharge due to disability by matching borrowers with student loans to the Veterans Affairs database. Eligible borrowers will receive application details directly from the department and can learn more on disabilitydischarge.com .\n\nIf you attend a school that closes before you finish your degree, you\u2019re eligible for closed school loan discharge. Or if you believe you\u2019ve been misled or defrauded by your school, you can apply for borrower defense to repayment, which, if you\u2019re approved, will discharge your loan debt.\n\nREDUCE YOUR INTEREST RATES\n\nIf you took out a loan before enlisting, your interest rate is capped at 6 percent while on active duty as part of the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act. Borrowers in areas of combat or serving during national emergencies are eligible for a 0 percent interest rate. This rule applies to both federal and private loans.\n\nThis article was provided to The Associated Press by the personal finance website NerdWallet. Anna Helhoski is a writer at NerdWallet.

(Nov. 8)\n\nBut Abrams\u2019 campaign believes there could be enough uncounted votes to bring Kemp below the majority threshold and trigger a second round of voting.\n\nAbrams\u2019 voter turnout strategy depended heavily on absentee and early voting, and her campaign manager Laruen Groh-Wargo said there isn\u2019t enough time to wait for more ballot counting and litigation if they have to replicate that effort.\n\n___\n\n1:25 p.m.\n\nIn a frantic effort to make sure every possible vote is counted, dozens of volunteers on Friday converged on a warehouse-turned-phone bank on Atlanta\u2019s east side.\n\nTheir goal: Try to reach voters who used a provisional ballot, then urge them to make sure their vote is counted by a 5 p.m. Friday deadline.

It is time to move on!\u201d\n\nDemocratic nominee Stacey Abrams disagrees, maintaining that enough ballots remain uncounted to force a runoff.

Let\u2019s blame the Russians and demand an immediate apology from President Putin!\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s message refers to allegations that Russian interference helped him win in 2016.\n\n___\n\n9:02 p.m.\n\nOutgoing Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal stood before a bank of cameras and welcomed into his office a man he recognized as his successor.\n\n\u201cThe governor-elect,\u201d Deal called Brian Kemp on Thursday, accepting his fellow Republican\u2019s resignation as secretary of state and promising the two would begin work immediately on transition business ahead of a January transfer of power.\n\nAll of it would be a routine scene two days after an election \u2014 except that Kemp\u2019s opponent, Democrat Stacey Abrams, maintains that enough ballots remain uncounted to force a runoff, and she\u2019s dispatched her legal team to explore every option to see if she\u2019s right.\n\n\u201cWe won a clear and convincing victory,\u201d Kemp said of returns showing him with 50.3 percent of almost 4 million votes, about a 63,000-vote lead over Abrams. That\u2019s a narrow sum considering the near-presidential election year turnout, though sufficient for the majority required for outright victory.\n\nThe Associated Press has not called the governor\u2019s race.\n\nWith legal wrangles opening and Abrams showing no signs of conceding, the dispute is prolonging a bitter contest with historical significance and national political repercussions. Abrams would become the first black woman elected governor of any U.S. state. Kemp seeks to maintain Republican dominance in a growing, diversifying Deep South state positioned to become a presidential battleground.\n\nThe key question is how many uncounted ballots actually remain.\n\nKemp said on Thursday morning that it\u2019s fewer than 21,000 \u2014 almost certainly not enough to force a runoff. The elections chief from the secretary of state\u2019s office \u2014 which Kemp ran until noon Thursday \u2014 said in an afternoon federal court hearing that the number is 21,190.\n\n\u201cEven if she got 100 percent of those votes, we still win,\u201d Kemp said.\n\nAbrams\u2019 campaign argues the total could be higher, and the secretary of state\u2019s office has shared scant details as officials in Georgia\u2019s 159 counties keep counting.\n\n\u201cThis is about the integrity of the election in the state of Georgia,\u201d said Abrams\u2019 campaign manager, Lauren Groh-Wargo. \u201cBrian Kemp can\u2019t just walk away from that. ... Our governor (Deal) can\u2019t just walk away from that.\u201d\n\nJohn Chandler, one of several attorneys for Abrams, promised to \u201clitigate until we have determined that every person\u2019s vote has been counted.\u201d\n\nA runoff, if needed, would be Dec. 4.\n\nCounty authorities must certify final returns by Tuesday. The state must certify a statewide result by Nov. 20. Deal appointed one of his Cabinet members to oversee the process in Kemp\u2019s place.\n\nOne of the lawsuits heard Thursday in federal court requested Kemp be barred from overseeing the rest of the certification procedure \u2014 a request pre-empted by Kemp\u2019s resignation.\n\nAbrams, other Democrats \u2014 including former President Jimmy Carter \u2014 and voting-rights activists had for months called for Kemp to step down amid charges he was abusing his office to make it harder for some Georgians, particularly minorities, to vote.\n\nKemp said his resignation \u201cwill give confidence to the certification process.\u201d He maintained he wasn\u2019t bowing to pressure but preparing to be governor.\n\n\u201cThat was all political,\u201d Kemp said, dismissing the criticism. He said Tuesday\u2019s turnout \u2014 about 1.4 million more than in Deal\u2019s last election \u2014 proves it.\n\nLeaders of Abrams\u2019 campaign said they believe she needs to pick up about 25,000 votes to force a runoff.\n\nOffering examples of potential ballots Democrats say Kemp isn\u2019t contemplating, Groh-Wargo said four counties reported considerably fewer early votes in the governor\u2019s race than the number of early ballots cast. Groh-Wargo said it seemed implausible that voters cared enough to cast ballots early but not in the hotly contested governor\u2019s race.\n\nShe added that officials in suburban Atlanta\u2019s Cobb County added several hundred votes to that count Thursday morning from absentee ballots. That came after the secretary of state\u2019s office said all absentee and early ballots had been counted.\n\nAbrams\u2019 lawyers also said they plan to sue officials in Dougherty County because absentee ballots were delayed after Hurricane Michael devastated parts of south Georgia. Separately, the American Civil Liberties Union raised concerns over 1,200 absentee ballots in Gwinnett County, northeast of Atlanta, which it said were rejected because of missing birthdate information.\n\n\u201cBrian Kemp owes voters an explanation,\u201d Groh-Wargo said, demanding to see lists and names. \u201cWe do not believe any of these numbers are credible.\u201d\n\nWhen Kemp\u2019s campaign declared victory Wednesday, his aides cited a statewide estimate of uncounted ballots from the secretary of state\u2019s office. But that office had not publicly offered a county-by-county breakdown to Abrams\u2019 campaign or to the news media at that point.\n\nThe provisional vote total is considerably higher than in 2016, when a slightly larger electorate yielded 16,739 provisional ballots. Of those, 7,592 were counted.\n\nState and campaign officials have said they expected a much higher proportion to be counted this year. In federal court Thursday, a secretary of state\u2019s representative said the provisional count included at least some votes cast late at a handful of metro Atlanta precincts that courts ordered to stay open past Tuesday\u2019s 7 p.m. poll closing time.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "Water well closed after higher level of chemicals detected\n\nTACOMA, Wash.

The Yellow Jackets, who have enjoyed a sharp increase in forced turnovers , have won four of five following a 1-3 start.\n\nOne year ago, Darrell Langham\u2019s 28-yard catch on a tipped ball on fourth down set up Michael Badgley\u2019s 24-yard field goal with 4 seconds left for the Hurricanes.\n\nIt\u2019s a bitter memory for the Yellow Jackets.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting on this one,\u201d said quarterback Tobias Oliver. \u201cIt\u2019s one we had marked on our calendars. We\u2019ve definitely been looking forward to it.\u201d\n\nEach team has been alternating quarterbacks. Miami coach Mark Richt announced Thursday he will start redshirt freshman N\u2019Kosi Perry over senior Malik Rosier for the second time this season.\n\n\u201cI think both Malik and N\u2019Kosi practiced well,\u201d Richt said. \u201cI think both competed well. We\u2019re just making the decision based on what we think gives us the best shot.\u201d\n\nMarshall, a senior, may keep the starting job for coach Paul Johnson. Oliver, a redshirt freshman, has seen his playing time increase, including in last week\u2019s 38-28 win at North Carolina .\n\nMarshall said he\u2019s confident Johnson \u201cis going to put the team in the best position to win.\u201d\n\n\u201cUltimately that\u2019s what we\u2019re all here for,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cWe want to win games and we want to get back to a bowl game.\u201d\n\nHere are some more things to know about the Miami-Georgia Tech game:\n\nLOVING ATLANTA\n\nRicht is right at home when facing off against Georgia Tech. He\u2019s a perfect 14-0 as a coach at Bobby Dodd Stadium, the Yellow Jackets\u2019 home field. Florida State was 5-0 there when Richt was an assistant for the Seminoles, Georgia was 8-0 there when he was the Bulldogs\u2019 head coach and Miami won there in 2016. Richt was a Miami player in 1978 when the Hurricanes lost at Georgia Tech.\n\nSTRENGTH VS. STRENGTH\n\nMiami ranks first in the ACC and second in the nation in total defense, allowing 264.7 yards per game. Georgia Tech leads the nation with its average of 377 yards rushing per game. Richt said it will be a challenge for his defense to contain the Yellow Jackets\u2019 option attack.\n\n\u201cPlaying against them, for the last 10 years of my career, it is tough on an offense to be sitting there waiting, waiting, waiting for an opportunity, if it holds true to form,\u201d Richt said. \u201cBut our defense has played well against them in the past and I have a lot of faith and confidence in this week.\u201d\n\nDECLINING ACCURACY\n\nAn interesting trend with Perry: His accuracy has dipped as games go along. He completes 61.5 percent of his first-quarter passes, 59.5 percent in the second quarter, 55 percent in the third and 33.3 percent in the fourth. Of his 105 throws this season, 99 have come at home \u2014 on the road, he\u2019s 3 for 6 with two interceptions.\n\nWHITEOUT GAME\n\nThis will be Georgia Tech\u2019s annual Whiteout game, a tradition that began with its 2008 game against Miami. The Yellow Jackets have won three of their last four Whiteout games, including a 28-27 win over Miami in 2014.\n\nCHANGE THE SCRIPT\n\nMiami has called recent players-only meetings in an attempt to salvage the season. \u201cSometimes that works. Sometimes that\u2019s sort of Hollywood,\u201d Hurricanes defensive coordinator Manny Diaz said. \u201cUltimately that is what it comes down to \u2014 the accountability falls first on us as coaches and secondly it falls on those guys to play.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Tim Reynolds in Miami contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "EAST PROVIDENCE, R.I.

The Border Patrol says this week it arrested nearly 450 migrants in western Arizona. (Yuma Sector Border Patrol via AP)\n\nPHOENIX (AP) \u2014 The U.S. Border Patrol said Friday it arrested 449 migrants this week during a 48-hour period in western Arizona, including two large groups of Central Americans.\n\nArizona Border Patrol agents for several months have been overwhelmed by the arrival of large numbers of Central American migrants traveling in families. The latest arrests near Yuma come as a caravan of several thousand Central American migrants slowly makes its way north, prompting President Trump to decry their efforts to reach the U.S. border.\n\nThe Border Patrol\u2019s Yuma Station reported that its agents apprehended 82 people from Guatemala and El Salvador traveling as families just before midnight Tuesday after an agency camera operator saw them scaling a wall east of the San Luis Port of Entry south of Yuma. They ranged in age from 2 to 48 years.\n\nOn Wednesday about four hours later, agents surprised 83 migrants crossing the border through a hole they dug underneath the same wall a short distance away. Those people from Guatemala and El Salvador ranged in age from 2 to 40.

The results could reverberate nationally. (AP Photo/Eric Gay, File)\n\nAUSTIN, Texas (AP) \u2014 Beto O\u2019Rourke didn\u2019t turn Texas blue. But for the first time in decades, it\u2019s looking much less red.\n\nThe midterm elections in Texas ousted a Republican who carried a \u201cbathroom bill\u201d targeting transgender people, drove out a GOP lawmaker who called federal immigration agents on Hispanic protesters and gave Democrats in Houston run of the nation\u2019s third most populous county.\n\nFor a generation, Texas has been a laboratory of conservatism that tested legal boundaries and churned out Republican presidential candidates. But cracks in the GOP\u2019s supremacy emerged this week in unexpected ways and races. As with many things Texas, the results could reverberate nationally.\n\nPredictions that Texas will come into play in 2020 may still be a stretch, but the signs of a subtle shift are more than mere talk.\n\n\u201cThis is the most optimistic I\u2019ve felt since high school,\u201d said Dallas state Rep. Eric Johnson, a 43-year-old Democrat who is running to become the first black speaker of the Texas House. \u201cI know for a fact that Texas is a purple state. It hasn\u2019t been voting that way because Democrats have forgotten how to win, to a certain degree. But Beto has reminded us.\u201d\n\nHe was unequivocal about why Democrats broke through this year.\n\n\u201cBeto was the reason,\u201d he said.\n\nIt remains to be seen what\u2019s next for O\u2019Rourke, who came within 3 percentage points of Republican Sen. Ted Cruz in the closest Senate race in Texas in 40 years. The El Paso congressman, who shattered fundraising records in a Senate campaign, raising more than $70 million, has insisted he\u2019s not interested in another office for now. But that has done little to dampen speculation that he could run again in 2020.\n\nTexas\u2019 other Senate seat, held by Republican John Cornyn, is up for re-election that year. He called the midterms a \u201cwake-up call\u201d for his party in Texas.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know whether this is a once-in-a- lifetime confluence of events or whether this represents something of the new normal,\u201d said Cornyn, the second-ranking Republican in the Senate.\n\nOn the surface, Texas didn\u2019t change much after Tuesday. Republicans continued a 24-year streak of sweeping statewide races and lost only two seats in Congress, both of which had already been trending toward Democrats. The GOP also still comfortably controls the Texas Legislature, even after losing a dozen seats in what was the biggest single-year pickup by Democrats in decades.\n\nBut Republicans\u2019 big margins shrank in a number of places.\n\nTypically easy wins in five congressional districts around Austin, Dallas and Houston were sliced to within 5 percentage points this time. The driving social conservative force in the Legislature, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, won just over 51 percent of the vote in his first election since pushing a failed North Carolina-style \u201cbathroom bill\u201d that would have required transgender people to use public bathrooms that correspond with the sex on their birth certificate. Not surviving, however, was a Republican who carried the bill in the House.\n\nTexas\u2019 last big Republican county, around Fort Worth, also crumbled at the top of the ticket. Fort Worth is \u201cCowtown,\u201d with stockyards and a cowboy image that stands in contrast to Texas\u2019 other big and increasingly liberal cities. Of Texas\u2019 five largest counties \u2014 the others around Dallas, Houston, San Antonio and Austin \u2014 Tarrant County was the only one President Donald Trump carried in 2016, doing so by 57,000 votes.\n\nTwo years later, O\u2019Rourke won the county over Cruz by 3,900 votes.\n\n\u201cWe flipped this state from blue to red. We may be shifting back a little toward the blue,\u201d Tarrant County Republican Party Chairman Darl Easton said. \u201cBut political shifts happen. I\u2019m not overly concerned about the current trend.\u201d\n\nFast-growing suburbs that for years have served as a GOP firewall to Texas\u2019 liberal big cities also either flipped to Democrats or were winnowed down to single-digit races. It was an abrupt turnaround from just four years ago, when Republicans coasted into every statewide office with 20-point victories.\n\nThe gap drastically shrunk on the coattails of a Democrat whose support for universal health care, marijuana legalization and immigration reform was mocked by Republicans as anathema to voters who\u2019ve kept the GOP in control of Texas since 1994.\n\nAfter his loss, O\u2019Rourke urged others to pick up where he left off.\n\n\u201cThis team, of which we are all members, in some way is going to stay together, is going to continue to aspire to do great things,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cThere are so many great candidates who are going to come out of this campaign.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Paul J.

Russian investigators are still working to understand how a rocket sensor ended up bent during manufacturing and how the hole wound up in the Soyuz.\n\nMcClain is set to blast off Dec. 3 on her first spaceflight, with a Russian and Canadian.

NASA chose her in 2013.\n\nMcClain said she views the Oct. 11 launch accident as \u201ca success story,\u201d given that the abort system saved her friends\u2019 lives. She was back home in Houston, watching the flight and listening to the astronauts\u2019 radio communications.\n\n\u201cThe crew was lucky. But every crew that makes it to orbit is lucky.

(Stefan Rousseau/PA via AP, file)\n\nLONDON (AP) \u2014 A minister in the British government stepped down Friday to protest Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s Brexit plan and is backing calls for a second referendum on whether the country should leave the European Union.\n\nJo Johnson, younger brother of former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, said the withdrawal agreement being discussed by EU and British leaders would greatly weaken Britain and require the country to follow EU rules without having any say. The only alternative on the table, he said, is a no-deal Brexit that would \u201cinflict untold damage\u201d on Britain.\n\n\u201cIt has become increasingly clear to me that the withdrawal agreement, which is being finalized in Brussels and Whitehall even as I write, will be a terrible mistake,\u201d said Jo Johnson, who was a transport minister in the government.\n\nTo give the public a choice between these two disastrous versions of Brexit would be a \u201cfailure of British statecraft on a scale unseen since the Suez crisis,\u201d he said, referencing the 1956 conflict against Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser that is widely seen as marking the moment at which Britain formally lost its imperial role in the world.\n\nInstead, Johnson said it would be proper to give the British public a chance to vote again because of the way the Brexit negotiations have evolved.\n\n\u201cGiven that the reality of Brexit has turned out to be so far from what was once promised, the democratic thing to do is to give the public the final say,\u201d Jo Johnson said.\n\nHis older brother Boris resigned in July to protest May\u2019s Brexit plan \u2014 but Boris did so as a staunch support of a hard-line Brexit, while Jo Johnson backed the \u201cremain\u201d side during the June, 2016 referendum.\n\nIn a tweet, Boris Johnson said he had \u201cboundless admiration\u201d for his brother and that they are \u201cunited in dismay\u201d at the indefensibility of May\u2019s position even though they disagree over Brexit.\n\nJo Johnson\u2019s resignation, and his call for a fresh referendum to test voter sentiment, further complicates matters for May as she tries to strike a deal with EU leaders that would pass muster with her own cabinet and win backing in Parliament.\n\nShe has consistently rejected the idea of another nationwide vote on Brexit, insisting her obligation is to make good on the will of the people as expressed in 2016.\n\nHer Conservative Party remains deeply divided on her approach, and it is not clear if she will win wide backing from opposition Labour Party lawmakers when any proposed deal is put to Parliament.\n\nMay is also facing more opposition from the Democratic Unionist Party, a party in Northern Ireland whose lawmakers have propped up May\u2019s minority government. Its leaders say May\u2019s government is breaking promises related to the Irish border.", "BRIDGEPORT, Conn.

Read about all the awards here: https://t.co/dyLaDQGhXw pic.twitter.com/bnRGiKqB9q \u2014 AP NFL (@AP_NFL) November 9, 2018\n\nMVP\n\nThis honor has gone to a quarterback the past five seasons and 10 of 11. Two running backs, Adrian Peterson in 2012 and LaDainian Tomlinson in 2006, broke through the QB domination in the past dozen years.\n\nLofton and some others select Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes.\n\n\u201cSo good you just can\u2019t take your eyes off of him,\u201d the CBS analyst says.\n\n\u201cMaybe this opinion changes next week, given the stellar competition that includes (Todd) Gurley and (Drew) Brees,\u201d adds USA Today\u2019s Jarrett Bell. \u201cMaybe not, as the kid keeps showing up. A first-year starter as quarterback? Hey, Mahomes is like the new Kurt Warner.\u201d\n\nPaul Domowitch of the Philadelphia Daily News opts for Brees. Charean Williams of Pro Football Talk prefers Gurley.\n\nDon\u2019t forget about Tom Brady, Adam Thielen or Philip Rivers, and perhaps even a defensive force such as J.J. Watt.\n\nCOACH\n\nAnother wide-open field headed by, according to Jenny Vrentas of Monday Morning Quarterback, Kansas City\u2019s Andy Reid.\n\n\u201cI selected Andy Reid ... for his ability to seamlessly transition from Alex Smith to Mahomes,\u201d Vrentas explains. \u201cHe\u2019s been so invested in Mahomes\u2019 development that he sits with him on the bench in between offensive series, going over what they see and how they\u2019ll attack the opponent next. Reid has demonstrated an ability to keep his offense fresh and tailored to his players, updating his West Coast system with spread concepts pulled from the college ranks.\u201d\n\nBob Glauber of Newsday points to last year\u2019s winner, Sean McVay of the Rams.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s one of the brightest minds in the game, and at 32, is proving not only to be a brilliant play caller, but an exceptional leader as well,\u201d Glauber says.\n\nNot far behind in our little poll: the Saints\u2019 Sean Payton, the Texans\u2019 Bill O\u2019Brien, the Bears\u2019 Matt Nagy, and the Chargers\u2019 Anthony Lynn, whose team \u201cplays a road game every week,\u201d Lofton notes.\n\nCOMEBACK PLAYER\n\nRarely has there been such an impressive group vying for an award no one really wants to win considering the implications of a comeback.\n\nFrom Watt to Peterson to Aaron Rodgers, from Andrew Luck to Carson Wentz to Deshaun Watson, from Odell Beckham Jr. to Richard Sherman \u2014 WOW!\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s either Andrew Luck or Watt,\u201d says Williams, \u201cbut Watt has returned to being one of the best at his position. He is playing at an All-Pro and Pro Bowl level. Luck is not one of the top-five quarterbacks in the NFL and maybe not in the top 10.\u201d\n\nEric Adelson of Yahoo Sports goes for the Colts quarterback.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t imagine the frustration he\u2019s faced,\u201d Adelson says. \u201cA pro\u2019s pro.\u201d\n\nVrentas picks Watt.\n\n\u201cThe surgery Watt had last October to put his leg back together after a tibial plateau fracture was so complicated that the surgeons couldn\u2019t even be certain that it would work, and that his leg would be able to bear the full weight of his body while running full speed,\u201d she explains. \u201cWatt, who has nine sacks in nine games, was undeterred. He wasn\u2019t back to full strength in the season opener but has steadily gotten better each week, a scary thought for opponents.\u201d\n\nOFFENSIVE PLAYER\n\nAnother free-for-all, with Gurley, Mahomes, Thielen, Brees, Michael Thomas and James Conner getting consideration.\n\n\u201cBefore it\u2019s done, he could wind up as MVP,\u201d Bell says of Gurley, his choice in this category. \u201cDitto for Brees. Running backs don\u2019t get the same love as quarterbacks in the pass-centric environment of the NFL. But if Gurley breaks LaDainian Tomlinson\u2019s single-season TD record and the Rams keep winning big, people will have to take notice. Then again, Brees has a few records and has never been MVP.\u201d\n\nDomowitch, a Brees supporter for MVP, puts Mahomes here. So does Williams.\n\nDEFENSIVE PLAYER\n\nThis category could be a two-horse race between a pair of thoroughbreds previously honored with the award: Aaron Donald and Watt.\n\n\u201cNow that\u2019s a man who don\u2019t need no stinking training camp,\u201d Bell says of Donald.\n\nEric Adelson of Yahoo Sports prefers Donald, as well.\n\n\u201cA game wrecker on every down,\u201d Adelson says.\n\nAdds Glauber: \u201cDonald is a disruptive force in the middle and already has 10 sacks. The only problem for him \u2014 and the Rams \u2014 is that teams will often go to great lengths to shut him down. Thus, the constant double teams he has to fight through.\u201d\n\nLofton likes what Khalil Mack has done in Chicago: \u201cMack turned the Bears from pretenders to contenders.\u201d But this train could be a runaway for Donald and Mack.\n\nOFFENSIVE ROOKIE\n\nNo contest.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the only good thing going for an awful Giants team,\u201d Glauber says of Giants RB Saquon Barkley. \u201cUntil the Giants figure out their quarterback situation, he\u2019ll be wasted in this offense.\u201d\n\nBut not lost in the awards prognostications.\n\n\u201cOn pace for more than 2,000 total yards \u2014 on a bad team,\u201d Adelson notes.\n\nDEFENSIVE ROOKIE\n\nChargers safety Derwin James has gotten lots of love, but there\u2019s no runaway leader.\n\n\u201cDarius Leonard and Denzel Ward make this an interesting race for the award down the stretch,\u201d Williams says.\n\nGlauber leans to Leonard: \u201cHalfway through the season, he not only led all NFL rookies with 88 tackles, he led all NFL players in that category. He also has four sacks and three forced fumbles and has already won defensive rookie of the week honors twice.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "", "Minor fire at chocolate plant that makes Hershey\u2019s Kisses\n\nHERSHEY, Pa.

It also defended its 12-4 congressional majority against a couple stiff Democratic challenges and held onto supermajorities in both chambers of the Ohio General Assembly.\n\nThe RNC said it teamed up with the Ohio Republican Party to make more than 5 million voter contacts, including door knocks and phone calls.\n\nThe state Democratic party disagreed with Republicans\u2019 assessment of their strategy.\n\n\u201cRepublican voters turned out because of Trump, plain and simple,\u201d said Kirstin Alvanitakis, spokeswoman for the Ohio Democratic Party. \u201cUnlike Democratic voters, their voters didn\u2019t have slate cards in their hands, and they didn\u2019t have a personal contact from a volunteer asking them to vote through the entire ballot, which is why they struggled so much in the Supreme Court races.\u201d\n\nSupreme Court candidates aren\u2019t shown as Democrats or Republicans on the ballot in Ohio. Democrats won both races Tuesday.\n\nDemocratic voters also came out in droves even though the party didn\u2019t have much success. In addition to the two state Supreme Court seats, Democrats cut into Republicans\u2019 Ohio House majority, the party\u2019s first midterm gains in a dozen years. Democratic governor nominee Richard Cordray won almost 90,000 more votes statewide Tuesday than Republican Gov. John Kasich did in his 2-to-1 landslide victory in 2014.\n\nDemocrats\u2019 coordinated campaign was robust, Alvanitakis said. It included almost 10 million paid digital impressions to likely and sporadic Democratic voters, promoting the entire slate \u2014 including the two successful Supreme Court candidates, Melody Stewart and Michael Donnelly.\n\nTwo-thirds of Ohio\u2019s voters said Trump played a role in their decisions, according to data gathered by AP VoteCast, a nationwide survey of more than 115,000 voters that included 3,842 voters in Ohio.\n\nRepublican voter Gary Smith, a marketing consultant from Dublin, said most of the candidates he favored were lined up behind the president.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely, Trump is on the ballot whether his name is there or not,\u201d Smith said.\n\nKevin Benson, a 38-year-old graphic designer from Westerville, Ohio, said he voted for Democrats even though he wasn\u2019t inspired by Cordray.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just, you know, he doesn\u2019t generate that enthusiasm that, you know, someone else could have,\u201d Benson said. \u201cThe Democrats in this state are kind of struggling trying to find quality candidates. I think he was the best they could\u2019ve found.\u201d\n\nUnlike the rallying cry of \u201cfix the damn roads\u201d that Democrat Gretchen Whitmer used to win the Michigan governor\u2019s office, Cordray\u2019s campaign lacked that kind of clear message that resonated with voters.\n\nTuesday\u2019s results also showed that Democrats can no longer simply count on piling up votes from the state\u2019s blue-collar workers, who still can swing an election.\n\nOne in five voters in Ohio was from a union household, and those voters leaned toward Cordray, according to VoteCast. But it wasn\u2019t nearly enough to make a difference.\n\nUnion households did prefer Democratic U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, who won a third term and has long been friendly to labor unions and against trade agreements, by a somewhat wider margin, VoteCast data showed.\n\nCordray\u2019s trouble connecting with working class voters showed up in blue-collar Mahoning County, where he got just under 49,000 votes compared with the more than 56,000 votes Democrat Ted Strickland collected there in 2010.\n\nWithout a better showing among people who traditionally backed Democrats, they were unable to overcome the GOP\u2019s dominance in rural Ohio.\n\nAbout half of DeWine\u2019s vote total came from the state\u2019s small towns and rural areas, a bigger share than what he picked up from the more populated suburbs, according to VoteCast.\n\n___\n\nSeewer reported from Toledo.

The federal lawsuit filed Monday said he was taunted, hit with a stun gun, pepper sprayed, beaten, punched and choked while \u201cpleading for help and struggling to stay alive.\u201d\n\nThe county\u2019s presiding commissioner, Carlin Bennett, declined to comment.\n\nHutcheson was not criminally charged in Sanders\u2019 death, but was dismissed soon after. He was at the jail the night Sanders died even though his law enforcement license had been suspended because of criminal allegations in unrelated cases .\n\nThe Southeast Missourian reports that the lawsuit filed in Cape Girardeau on behalf of Sanders\u2019 nine children and other relatives names Hutcheson and other law enforcement officers, as well as Mississippi County and the town of Charleston. The lawsuit alleges civil rights violations, false imprisonment and wrongful death.\n\nSanders, of Nashville, ran out of gas May 4, 2017, in southern Missouri, then hitchhiked and ended up in Charleston.\n\nA day later, Sanders told police officers there was a warrant out for his arrest in Nashville related to an altercation with the mother of his children. The lawsuit said Sanders also told officers: \u201cI need to see a mental health doctor to save my life and my kids\u2019 life.\u201d\n\nHe was taken to the jail, where a mental health counselor concluded Sanders was suffering from paranoia as a result of substance abuse, and that he should be hospitalized for observation, the suit states.\n\nBut he remained at the jail.\n\nThe suit says that on the night of May 5, Hutcheson led a team of officers and jailers, wearing helmets and vests and holding a large shield, into Sanders\u2019 cell. The lawsuit said Sanders was tackled and punched as the officers tried to place him in handcuffs and leg irons.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that Hutcheson pressed his left knee on top of Sanders\u2019 neck. Charleston police officer Curtis Anderson told Hutcheson at least three times to remove the pressure, the lawsuit said.\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m good,\u201d the sheriff responded, according to the lawsuit.\n\nHutcheson applied pressure to the neck for up to three minutes after Sanders stopped moving, the lawsuit alleges.\n\n\u201cNo lifesaving measures were taken\u201d after Sanders stopped breathing, the suit states. Emergency medical personnel arrived and took him to a hospital, where he died a short time later.\n\nMissouri Attorney General Josh Hawley\u2019s office investigated Sanders\u2019 death but decided against charges. Medical experts concluded that Sanders died because of a medical condition known as \u201dexcited delirium ,\u201d and not as a result of the officers\u2019 attempts to subdue him.\n\nSanders was the third person to die in the jail over the past few years, a pattern Hawley has called \u201ctroubling.\u201d\n\nAbout a month before Sanders\u2019 death, Hutcheson was arrested for allegedly tracking the cellphones of a judge and law enforcement officers. He also was accused of taking his sister-in-law\u2019s paycheck from the hair salon where she had worked, and was charged with robbery.\n\nThose cases are still pending.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Southeast Missourian, http://www.semissourian.com", "FILE -In this Sunday, Nov. 4, 2018, file photo, Buffalo Bills' Matt Barkley (5) warms up before an NFL football game against the Chicago Bears in Orchard Park, N.Y.

Derek Anderson is out. And that means it might be Matt Barkley time for Buffalo.\n\nBarkley is suddenly in the mix to start against the New York Jets on Sunday, some 10 days after Buffalo signed the journeyman to serve as an emergency backup.\n\nCoach Sean McDermott on Friday backed off his previous commitment of having turnover-prone backup Nathan Peterman start against the Jets if Allen and Anderson can\u2019t play. Asked about the possibility of Peterman starting, McDermott sidestepped the question by saying he preferred to keep the focus on Allen.\n\nThat\u2019s a switch from Monday, when McDermott said Peterman would be the starter.\n\nAnderson will miss his second game due to a concussion .\n\nAllen is listed as questionable on Buffalo\u2019s injury report. He\u2019s been out since spraining his right throwing elbow in a 20-13 loss at Houston on Oct. 14. Allen began testing his arm last week , and practiced on a limited basis for the past three days.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to take it one day at a time here,\u201d McDermott said of Allen. \u201cIt comes down to No. 1, a medical decision and making sure we\u2019re doing everything right in terms of the priority of being his health and functionality from a football standpoint.\u201d\n\nOne consideration is Allen benefiting from an additional break with Buffalo entering its bye week after playing the Jets.\n\nA person familiar with the situation told The Associated Press that Barkley is being considered ahead of Peterman, but a final decision hasn\u2019t yet been made. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because McDermott did not reveal the team\u2019s plans.\n\nThe Bills are 2-7 and have lost four straight.\n\nPeterman has thrown seven interceptions in four appearances this season, including three in a 41-9 loss to Chicago last weekend.\n\nThe Bills signed Barkley on Oct. 30. He is on his sixth team in six seasons, and hasn\u2019t appeared in a regular-season game since 2016, when he started six games with the Chicago Bears. Barkley was cut by the Cincinnati Bengals in September after hurting his knee in a preseason game.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all in the mix to start. You could be out there, we never know,\u201d Barkley said with a laugh, referring to a reporter.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a little bit surprised of how quickly I was able to pick up this stuff,\u201d he added, after taking additional snaps after practice and being the last quarterback to leave the field. \u201cIt\u2019s really like riding a bike. You get a little sweat going and it\u2019s go time. You\u2019ve done it for years, so I should be good to go.\u201d\n\nBarkley was selected by Philadelphia in the fourth round of the 2013 draft, and spent his first two seasons there. Overall, he has a 1-5 record as a starter and has gone 159 for 266 for 1,911 yards with eight touchdowns and 18 interceptions in 11 career appearances.\n\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t maybe been the plan I signed up for when I thought of going to the NFL,\u201d Barkley said of his numerous pro stops. \u201cBut from what I\u2019ve been able to learn along the way, I think I\u2019m in a great spot right now.\u201d\n\nBarkley would become the fourth quarterback to start for the Bills this season, and third in three weeks.\n\nThe carousel at quarterback has contributed to the offense\u2019s season-long struggles. Buffalo has scored two touchdowns in its past four games, eight overall, and has an NFL-worst 96 points.\n\nRunning back LeSean McCoy is familiar with Barkley from when the two played in Philadelphia.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s intelligent. He\u2019ll have a tough time because they\u2019re a good defense and it\u2019s a fresh start, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s nothing he can\u2019t handle,\u201d McCoy said. \u201cWe\u2019ll support him. We\u2019ll be behind him. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll have a good game. It\u2019ll be a tough matchup. It\u2019s a good defense.\u201d\n\nStarting tight end Charles Clay was ruled out after hurting his hamstring last weekend. Defensive end Trent Murphy will miss his third game with a knee injury.

Schneider ordered the agency to pay the Bright family\u2019s legal fees and to create new training for CPS workers.\n\n\u201cWe do need to deal with the issue of how we make sure this doesn\u2019t happen again,\u201d Schneider said.\n\nFollowing the ruling this week, the family\u2019s attorneys are calling for the firing of the CPS workers involved in wrongfully removing 2-year-old Charlotte and 5-month-old Mason.\n\nThe trouble started in July, when Mason fell from a lawn chair onto their cement driveway in Tomball. Melissa Bright immediately took Mason to the hospital for his head injury, but an MRI revealed that Mason had a second, smaller fracture and bleeding in his brain.\n\nMelissa Bright couldn\u2019t explain her child\u2019s second fracture, which resulted in a child abuse prevention team determining that Mason\u2019s injuries were \u201cconsistent with child abuse.\u201d CPS workers decided that the children would need to be placed in the care of other family members.\n\nBut the Texas Children\u2019s Hospital later found that Mason likely had a blood clotting disorder, which explained his additional health issues. Mason\u2019s head injury also didn\u2019t heal as planned and required the baby to have a hole drilled in his brain to relieve pressure.\n\nMelissa Bright needed to nurse Mason in order to prevent a second injury, but CPS wouldn\u2019t let the mother live with her child.\n\nThe family tried to work with the agency to move the child closer to home but case workers delayed getting approval, leading the family to bring their children home on their own. The move resulted in a caseworker, Lavar Jones, seeking emergency custody of the children in September without telling the court about Mason\u2019s diagnosed blood disorder and a medical opinion that explained his second injury.\n\nJones was questioned weeks later in court about the agency\u2019s reasons for removing the kids, and the caseworker pleaded the Fifth Amendment, which allowed her to decline to answer questions that might incriminate her.\n\n\u201cThey lied in their affidavit, they lied in their sworn removal testimony and they have \u2014 when questioned about those lies \u2014 taken the Fifth,\u201d said Dennis Slate, the family\u2019s attorney.\n\nThe case is a sign of a \u201cbroken system\u201d and the need for more accountability, the family\u2019s attorneys said.\n\nCPS spokeswoman Tejal Patel said the agency is reviewing options, including an appeal.\n\nSchneider gave CPS two weeks to develop new training for its workers.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Houston Chronicle, http://www.houstonchronicle.com", "GOP legislators pick new leaders for Utah House and Senate\n\nSALT LAKE CITY (AP) \u2014 Majority Republicans in the Utah Legislature have chosen new leaders for the House and Senate as they reorganized in the wake of Tuesday\u2019s election.\n\nHouse Republicans picked Rep.

(AP) \u2014 The young man traversed Andean mountains, plains and cities in buses, took a harrowing boat ride in which five fellow migrants drowned, walked through thick jungle for days, and finally reached the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nThen Abdoulaye Camara, from the poor West African country of Mauritania, asked U.S. officials for asylum.\n\nCamara\u2019s arduous journey highlights how immigration to the United States through its southern border is evolving. Instead of being almost exclusively people from Latin America, the stream of migrants crossing the Mexican border these days includes many who come from the other side of the world.\n\nAlmost 3,000 citizens of India were apprehended entering the U.S. from Mexico last year. In 2007, only 76 were. The number of Nepalese rose from just four in 2007 to 647 last year. More people from Africa are also seeking to get into the United States, with hundreds having reached Mexican towns across the border from Texas in recent weeks, according to local news reports from both sides of the border.\n\nCamara\u2019s journey began more than a year ago in the small town of Toulel, in southern Mauritania. He left Mauritania, where slavery is illegal but still practiced, \u201cbecause it\u2019s a country that doesn\u2019t know human rights,\u201d he said.\n\nCamara was one of 124 migrants who ended up in a federal prison in Oregon after being detained in the U.S. near the border with Mexico in May, the result of the Trump administration\u2019s zero tolerance policy.\n\nHe was released Oct. 3, after he had passed his \u201ccredible fear\u201d exam, the first step on obtaining asylum, and members of the community near the prison donated money for his bond. He was assisted by lawyers working pro bono.\n\n\u201cMy heart is so gracious, and I am so happy. I really thank my lawyers who got me out of that detention,\u201d Camara said in French as he rode in a car away from the prison.\n\nCamara\u2019s journey was epic, yet more people are making similar treks to reach the United States. It took him from his village on the edge of the Sahara desert to Morocco by plane and then a flight to Brazil. He stayed there 15 months, picking apples in orchards and saving his earnings as best he could. Finally he felt he had enough to make it to the United States.\n\nAll that lay between him and the U.S. border was 6,000 miles (9,700 kilometers).\n\n\u201cIt was very, very difficult,\u201d said Camara, 30. \u201cI climbed mountains, I crossed rivers. I crossed many rivers, the sea.\u201d\n\nCamara learned Portuguese in Brazil and could understand a lot of Spanish, which is similar, but not speak it very well. He rode buses through Brazil, Peru and Colombia. Then he and others on the migrant trail faced the most serious obstacle: the Darien Gap, a 60-mile (97-kilometer) stretch of roadless jungle straddling the border of Colombia and Panama.\n\nBut first, he and other travelers who gathered in the town of Turbo, Colombia, had to cross the Gulf of Uraba, a long and wide inlet from the Caribbean Sea. Turbo, on its southeast shore, has become a major point on the migrant trail, where travelers can resupply and where human smugglers offer boat rides.\n\nCamara and about 75 other people boarded a launch for Capurgana, a village next to the Panamanian border on the other end of the gulf.\n\nWhile the slow-moving boat was far from shore, the seas got very rough.\n\n\u201cThere was a wave that came and tipped over the canoe,\u201d Camara said. \u201cFive people fell into the water, and they couldn\u2019t swim.\u201d\n\nThey all drowned, he said. The survivors pushed on.\n\nFinally arriving in Capurgana after spending two nights on the boat, the migrants split into smaller groups to cross the infamous Darien Gap, a wild place that has tested the most seasoned of travelers. The thick jungle hides swamps that can swallow a man. Lost travelers have died, and been devoured, boots and all, by packs of wild boars, or have been found, half out of their minds.\n\nCamara\u2019s group consisted of 37 people, including women \u2014 two of them pregnant, one from Cameroon and one from Congo \u2014 and children.\n\n\u201cWe walked seven days and climbed up into the mountains, into the forest,\u201d Camara said. \u201cWhen it was night, we slept on the ground. We just kept walking and sleeping, walking and sleeping. It was hard.\u201d\n\nOne man, who was around 26 and from the African nation of Guinea, died, perhaps from exhaustion combined with thirst, Camara said.\n\nBy the sixth day, all the drinks the group had brought with them were gone. They drank water from a river. They came across a Panamanian man and his wife, who sold them some bananas for $5, Camara said.\n\nOnce he got out of the jungle, Camara went to Panamanian immigration officials who gave him travel documents enabling him to go on to Costa Rica, which he reached by bus. In Costa Rica, he repeated that process in hopes of going on to Nicaragua. But he heard authorities there were not so accommodating, so he and about 100 other migrants took a boat around Nicaragua, traveling at night along its Pacific coast.\n\n\u201cAll we could see were the lights of Nicaragua,\u201d he said. Then it was over land again, in cars, buses and sometimes on foot, across Honduras, Guatemala and Mexico, all the way to the U.S. border at Tijuana. He was just about out of money and spent the night in a migrant shelter.\n\nOn May 20, he crossed into San Ysidro, south of San Diego.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018I came, I came. I\u2019m from Africa. I want help,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nHe is going to stay with a brother in Philadelphia while he pursues his asylum request.\n\n___\n\nAndrew Selsky on Twitter: https://twitter.com/andrewselsky", "BALTIMORE (AP) \u2014 A Baltimore police officer has testified that a video appearing to show him planting drugs was actually his attempt to recreate his discovery.\n\nRichard Pinheiro Jr. is on trial for charges of fabricating evidence and misconduct.

The court in the northern city of Leeuwarden said in a statement that by blocking the highway last year, they \u201ctook the law into their own hands\u201d to infringe protesters\u2019 constitutional right to demonstrate.\n\nLawyers representing the anti-racism demonstrators welcomed the ruling, saying in a written statement that it \u201csent a signal that citizens in a democratic society cannot play judge.\u201d\n\nThe ruling came just over a week before this year\u2019s nationally televised parade to welcome the Dutch character Sinterklaas to the country for a festive period that ends on Dec. 5 when families traditionally exchange gifts.\n\nSmaller Sinterklaas parades are scheduled across the country next weekend and protests both for and against Black Pete are expected at a handful of them.", "CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas (AP) \u2014 A state district judge who was earlier cleared in a South Texas road-rage incident has been arrested on suspicion of driving while intoxicated and unlawfully carrying a weapon.\n\nCorpus Christi police say Judge Guy Williams was taken into custody by officers who responded to a disturbance call Thursday.\n\nWilliams bonded out Friday from the Nueces (nyoo-AY\u2019-suhs) County jail.\n\nThe 68-year-old Williams was acquitted on an assault charge last year following an encounter with another motorist.\n\nHe faces unrelated charges filed in May of public intoxication and resisting arrest.\n\nHe was suspended from the bench last year by the State Commission on Judicial Conduct but was later reinstated.\n\nWilliams did not seek re-election and will be replaced in January when a newly elected jurist takes office.", "FORT HALL, Idaho (AP) \u2014 Tribal authorities in eastern Idaho say they\u2019ve arrested a man in connection with the beating of a trucker from Missouri at a truck stop.\n\nThe Shoshone-Bannock Tribes say 23-year-old Stormy Adakai of Fort Hall was arrested Thursday and is charged with felony aggravated assault and felony robbery.\n\nAmos Phillips of Camdenton was sleeping inside his cab at a Fort Hall truck stop on Sept. 2.

(AP Photo/Bryan Woolston, File)\n\nATHENS, Ga. (AP) \u2014 The Georgia Bulldogs are in position to reach all their goals.\n\nAssuming they don\u2019t slip up in the Deep South\u2019s oldest rivalry.\n\nNo. 5 Georgia (8-1, 6-1, No. 5 CFP) is a two-touchdown favorite for its 123rd meeting with Auburn, a team that has endured a disappointing season after starting out in the top 10.\n\nIf the Bulldogs can win their remaining regular-season games \u2014 after Auburn, they\u2019ll also be big favorites against UMass and Georgia Tech \u2014 it would set up a rematch with top-ranked Alabama in the Southeastern Conference championship game and a conduit to the College Football Playoff.\n\n\u201cWe go at it even harder because we know we\u2019ve got so much at stake,\u201d Georgia offensive lineman Solomon Kindley said. \u201cWe know that they\u2019re coming in here to try to ruin our season.\u201d\n\nThis will be third meeting between these teams in the last 12 months.\n\nAuburn romped past the Bulldogs during the 2017 regular season, but Georgia rebounded with an emphatic victory in the SEC title game .\n\nThe Tigers (6-3, 3-3, No. 24 CFP) are feeling more upbeat after rallying for two fourth-quarter touchdowns to beat Texas A&M , their biggest win since a season-opening triumph over Washington.\n\n\u201cIt felt different from a confidence standpoint,\u201d coach Gus Malzahn said. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what we needed \u2014 that kind of win to help give us some momentum moving forward.\u201d\n\nAn upset of Georgia would really give this season a whole new feel.\n\nSome other things to watch for in Saturday\u2019s game between the hedges:\n\nDYNAMIC DUO\n\nD\u2019Andre Swift and Elijah Holyfield are carrying on Georgia\u2019s tradition of elite running backs .\n\nAfter nagging injuries slowed his production much of the season, Swift is feeling better than he has since his dynamic freshman year. It sure showed last week when he ripped off 156 yards and two touchdowns in last week\u2019s 34-17 victory over Kentucky , clinching a second straight SEC East title for the Bulldogs.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m definitely getting back to my old self,\u201d Swift said.\n\nHolyfield rushed for a career-best 115 yards against the Wildcats and leads the Bulldogs with 674 yards. Swift is right on his heels (622 yards) and both are averaging over 6 yards per carry, giving Georgia the SEC\u2019s top-ranked rushing attack at 233.8 yards per game.\n\nRUNNING WOES\n\nWhile Georgia\u2019s ground game is humming, Auburn\u2019s is a mess.\n\nFour players have taken a shot as the No. 1 running back and the line has been shaky all season. The Tigers are coming off their worst showing of the season, gaining just 19 yards rushing in the victory over Texas A&M.\n\nMalzahn said he can\u2019t afford to abandon the running game against Georgia.\n\n\u201cThe more talented teams that you play, the more important it is to be balanced,\u201d he said.\n\nMalzahn thought youth was issue early in the season.\n\nNot anymore.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting to a point now where we need to be more effective,\u201d the coach said. \u201cThat\u2019s our challenge, whether it\u2019s getting a little more creative in the run game or doing things a little bit different or not doing some of the things as much. All those things are on deck.\u201d\n\nCHANGE OF PACE\n\nJake Fromm is unquestionably Georgia\u2019s top quarterback, but freshman Justin Fields has provided an effective weapon off the bench.\n\nFields is more of a dual threat than Fromm, which forces opposing defenses to worry more about containment than teeing off when the youngster\u2019s on the field. He rushed for 26 yards on six carries against Kentucky, which also helped to open up things for Swift and Holyfield.\n\n\u201cJustin brings a different element to the game,\u201d Swift said. \u201cHe can pass. He can run. The defense is aware of that. The ends need to stay on their jobs. If they don\u2019t respect it, Justin\u2019s just going to run, so they\u2019ve got to respect it.\u201d\n\nTHE BIG SHORT\n\nGeorgia is still trying to sort out its struggles in short-yardage situations.\n\nThe Bulldogs were a bit more effective in the win over Kentucky, but the issue reared its head again when they were stuffed for no gain on a pair of third-and-1 situations and a false-start penalty ruined a fourth-and-goal at the 1.\n\n\u201cWe worked really hard on it last week and that\u2019s probably the most frustrating thing is that we didn\u2019t overcome the obstacles we had previously,\u201d coach Kirby Smart said. \u201cI was more disappointed in some of the organizational things, not necessarily what we did. Just the way we went about it. We\u2019ll continue to work on it and get better at it.\u201d\n\nRECORD IN REACH\n\nAuburn\u2019s Ryan Davis is on the cusp of becoming the top pass-catcher in school history.\n\nThe senior has 152 career receptions, leaving him one behind Courtney Taylor\u2019s mark from 2003-06.\n\nDavis has 128 receptions off throws from Jarrett Stidham, which makes them the second-most effective tandem in Auburn history.

The plan includes a location for high-traffic public agencies, such as the Department of Motor Vehicles, state treasurer, child support and an unclaimed property department.\n\nThe plan would be completed in phases. Consultants proposed long-term projects, such as renovation or new construction near the Pershing Center.\n\nConstruction of new buildings is the most cost-effective approach for the state in the long run because of increasing lease rates and demand for premium office space in downtown Lincoln, according to consultants from companies DLR Group, WRT, Berggren Architects, NAI/FMA Realty and Olsson Associates.\n\nThe 20-year plan outlines benefits totaling a cost savings of about $11 million, or $550,000 annually.

That would include specifying that only a Senate-confirmed Justice Department official \u2014 which Whitaker is not \u2014 could dismiss Mueller.\n\nWhitaker, a Republican Party loyalist and chief of staff to just-ousted Attorney General Jeff Sessions, was elevated Wednesday after his boss was forced from his job by Trump. The new position handed him oversight of Mueller\u2019s investigation into possible ties between Russia and Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nSince Wednesday, Whitaker has faced pressure from Democrats to recuse himself from overseeing Mueller based on critical comments he made about the investigation before joining the Justice Department last year.\n\nThose included an op-ed article in which he said Mueller would be straying outside his mandate if he investigated Trump family finances and a talk radio interview in which he maintained there was no evidence of collusion between the Kremlin and the Trump campaign.

The July 10, 2017, email was from an FBI victims\u2019 specialist to someone who the newspaper said was an alleged victim of the company. A Justice Department spokeswoman told the Journal that Whitaker was \u201cnot aware of any fraudulent activity.\u201d\n\nAlso Friday, The Associated Press reported that Whitaker repeatedly chided presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in public statements during 2016 while he was speaking for a group that is barred by its tax-exempt status from supporting or opposing political candidates during a campaign.\n\nWhitaker himself stayed out of the public debate Friday.

(AP) \u2014 Kentucky\u2019s dreams of a 10-win season and potential New Year\u2019s Six bowl appearance likely depend on whether it can earn a rare road victory over Tennessee.\n\nThe 12th-ranked Wildcats (7-2, 5-2 SEC, No. 11 College Football Playoff) have lost 16 straight road games to the Volunteers and haven\u2019t beaten Tennessee in Knoxville since 1984, but they head to Neyland Stadium on Saturday as six-point favorites.\n\nKentucky coach Mark Stoops said he wouldn\u2019t talk to his players about the program\u2019s history of frustration at Neyland Stadium. Kentucky already ended another long streak earlier this season when it beat Florida 27-16 after losing to the Gators for 31 straight years.\n\n\u201cI think just beating Tennessee is important to us,\u201d Stoops said. \u201cWhether there\u2019s a streak involved or not, why would that make a difference to our team, really? They don\u2019t know anything about 34 years ago. (To) be honest with you, they really don\u2019t care. They want to win for their team this year.\u201d\n\nKentucky was bidding for its first Southeastern Conference championship game appearance in school history, but that hope died with a 34-17 loss to No. 5 Georgia (No. 5 CFP) last week. Kentucky still has a shot at earning its first 10-win season since 1977. The Wildcats follow up this trip to Tennessee by hosting Middle Tennessee and visiting Louisville.\n\nTennessee defensive end Kyle Phillips believes the nature of this rivalry will assure that Kentucky doesn\u2019t have any emotional letdown over losing out on the SEC East title.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t like us a lot,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to play their best game. They\u2019re going to definitely come in and play their best game.\u201d\n\nTennessee also has plenty at stake.\n\nThe Vols didn\u2019t reach a bowl game last season and must win two of their final three games to become bowl eligible this year. Tennessee follows the Kentucky game by hosting Missouri and traveling to Vanderbilt.\n\nAlthough Tennessee has won 31 of the last 33 overall meetings in this series, Kentucky won last year\u2019s game 29-26 . The Wildcats haven\u2019t beaten Tennessee in consecutive years since 1976-77.\n\nHere are things to know about Tennessee\u2019s matchup with Kentucky.\n\nWATCH OUT FOR ALLEN\n\nKentucky\u2019s Josh Allen has 10 sacks and 14 \u00bd tackles for loss to lead the SEC in both categories. He recovered two fumbles against Georgia last week. Allen will be facing an unsettled Tennessee offensive line that has struggled without left tackle Trey Smith, who is out indefinitely after doctors found blood clots in his lungs last month.\n\nVOLS\u2019 RUNNING WOES\n\nTennessee ran for just 20 yards on 26 carries last week in a 14-3 victory over Charlotte . The Vols are hoping leading rushers Tim Jordan and Ty Chandler will be able to play more this week after nagging injuries limited them to a combined six carries against Charlotte. They\u2019re facing a Kentucky defense that has allowed just 15.3 points per game to rank eighth nationally in scoring defense .\n\nKENTUCKY\u2019S INJURED LINEBACKERS\n\nKentucky linebackers Kash Daniel and Jordan Jones are both playing with casts on one of their hands due to injuries. Daniel has 58 tackles to rank third on the team. Jones has 55 tackles, the Wildcats\u2019 fifth-highest total.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s not comfortable for them,\u201d Stoops said. \u201cI will say this, they both did some very good things with those clubs on, and it kind of surprised me sometimes, some of the good plays they made. And there\u2019s times when you could tell when not having the grip really hurts them.\u201d\n\nSNELL SEEKS ENCORE\n\nKentucky\u2019s Benny Snell Jr. has rushed for 1,008 yards to lead the SEC . He ran for 180 yards and three touchdowns in Kentucky\u2019s victory over Tennessee last year.\n\nSnell will face a Tennessee defense that is allowing 4.5 yards per carry . Vanderbilt and Mississippi are the only SEC teams yielding more yards per rush.\n\nGUARANTANO\u2019S EFFICIENCY\n\nTennessee quarterback Jarrett Guarantano has thrown only two interceptions all season. He has completed 67.6 percent of his passes for seven touchdowns with no interceptions in his last four games.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\n___\n\nFollow Steve Megargee at https://twitter.com/stevemegargee", "DOVER, Del.

(AP Photo/Nelson Antoine)\n\nSAO PAULO (AP) \u2014 For the first time since 1970, there will be no Brazilian driver in a Formula One race in Brazil.\n\nSo fans in the racing-crazy South American nation, home to eight F1 titles by three champions, are putting all their hopes on two young test drivers who will have a bigger role in the series next year.\n\nPietro Fittipaldi, the 22-year-old grandson of former F1 champion Emerson Fittipaldi, was announced Friday as test driver for Haas starting after the season-ending Abu Dhabi GP.\n\nSergio Sette Camara, the 20-year-old who is the only Latin American driver in Formula 2, will be McLaren\u2019s test driver next year.\n\nSette Camara is sixth in the F2 standings with one race to go this season, while Pietro Fittipaldi drove as a part-time driver in the IndyCar Series. Both had their seasons marred by crashes that forced them to miss races.\n\nDespite not having the same impressive results as some of the former Brazilian drivers before they reached F1, Sette Camara and Pietro Fittipaldi are the closest the country has to F1 since Felipe Massa retired last season after a successful career in the series.\n\nThe standards are high for Brazilian fans who were used to cheering for racing greats such as Nelson Piquet and Ayrton Senna, and more recently for less legendary names such as Massa and Rubens Barrichello.\n\n\u201cI hope these test drivers are better than fans expect. What are their names again?\u201d said 45-year-old engineer Augusto Daniel, wearing a Mercedes cap. \u201cI love racing regardless of seeing any Brazilian on the grid, but it is obviously disappointing not to be able to wave our flag for a local driver. It will be a strange experience this time, it will be a bit less emotional too.\u201d\n\nSenna was the last Brazilian to win the F1 title, in 1991. Pique won his three world titles in the 1980s, and Fittipaldi won two in the early 1970s.\n\nMassa came close with Ferrari in 2008, losing the title by one point to Lewis Hamilton in the last lap of the season-ending race at Interlagos.\n\n\u201cThere are just too many reasons as to why we have no Brazilian drivers on the grid,\u201d McLaren\u2019s sporting director Gil de Ferran said. \u201cThere is the lack of sponsorship deals for younger drivers, there needs to be a better organization of the local racing calendar, professionals need better pay. Also, the country is in a long economy crisis. It is just too many factors. We have to root for our test drivers to succeed for now.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the week, five-time world champion Hamilton said he doesn\u2019t know what Brazil is doing to put drivers into F1, but he can see what other nations are doing well.\n\n\u201cMexico is putting a lot of money to put their drivers in F1, Russia too,\u201d the British driver said.\n\nHamilton said he did not know much about Sette Camara, who had just been announced as McLaren\u2019s test driver.\n\n\u201cBut there\u2019s definitely space for Brazil, this is a country of hardcore racing fans,\u201d the Mercedes driver said.\n\nMexican Sergio Perez of Force India is the only Latin American driver on the F1 grid this year.\n\nSette Camara trusts Brazil\u2019s traditions in F1 to end the short drought of local drivers in the series.\n\n\u201cThis moment will pass because we had those mavericks opening the way, we are acknowledged as a country where talent flourishes, even if our economy is not as strong as Europe\u2019s,\u201d he said.\n\nPietro Fittipaldi said Brazil\u2019s return to F1 could have happened earlier, as he was supposed to test for Haas before the Hungarian Grand Prix this year. He couldn\u2019t because he broke both legs in a serious accident while driving in the World Endurance Championship.\n\nHe also believes the shortage of samba on the grid will be gone soon.\n\n\u201cThere are several young pilots, including me, Sergio. I am 100 percent sure there will be another Brazilian driver in F1 pretty soon,\u201d the young Fittipaldi said. \u201cAnd there is also my brother, Enzo...\u201d\n\nRacing specialists see 17-year-old Enzo Fittipaldi as the biggest upcoming Brazilian talent. This year he had the best performance among all Ferrari academy drivers and ended with a Formula 4 title in Italy. He and Pietro will live together in Maranello, where the youngest will be able to learn from F1 much before he ever has a chance to fight for a cockpit.\n\n___\n\nMore AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-AutoRacing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) \u2014 Kenya\u2019s internal security minister Friday launched a police internal affairs unit to investigate allegations of abuses in the force including corruption and accusations that officers kill suspects and perpetrate other human rights abuses.\n\nThe new investigation body has been welcomed with optimism by some rights activists, but many remain skeptical on its ability to bring adequate change.\n\nThe internal affairs unit will put the police on a \u201ctrajectory of reforms,\u201d Internal Security Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiangi said. The unit has been launched amid allegations by human rights groups and the public that police killed 22 suspects in the last two weeks in a low-income area of Nairobi.\n\nRights groups have for years claimed that Kenya\u2019s police force is riddled with corruption and carries out abuses.\n\nEric Kiraithe, a former police spokesman who is now the government spokesman admitted that corruption in the force saying it \u201cruns deep and wide.\u201d\n\nThe local chapter of the international anti-corruption watchdog Transparency International has for more than a decade ranked the Kenyan police as the most corrupt institution in a country where corruption is endemic.\n\nThe abuses have continued despite an exercise in which all 100,000 officers are being scrutinized, rights advocates say. Some 2,000 officers have been fired out of around 50,000 scrutinized as the exercise which started in December 2013 and is continuing.\n\nWhen that investigation began, body parts from a person reported kidnapped were sent to the National Police Service Commission with a note warning the chairman to tread carefully.\n\nThe Independent Medico-Legal Unit, or IMLU, has conducted autopsies on the bodies of the 22 killed by police. \u201cOur preliminary investigations indicate that those were extrajudicial killings,\u201d said Peter Kiama, the executive director of the group. \u201cThey were not done according to the law. The police were in a position to arrest and not kill those individuals.\u201d\n\nThe IMLU in 2014 documented how a majority of police killings at that time were connected to police extorting money from suspects and not police work.

Antonio Andrade, the vice governor of Minas Gerais state and a former agriculture minister, was also arrested, his press office said.\n\nPolice said in a statement that the arrests were part of an investigation into a graft scheme that dates to 2014-2015 in which executives paid bribes to civil servants and politicians linked to the Agriculture Ministry in exchange for favorable decisions and regulation that helped JBS eliminate competition. Police said that there is evidence that some targets of the investigation tried to throw the probe off course even though they were ostensibly cooperating.\n\nPolice said they had arrested 16 people in all Friday, and they are still seeking three more. They were also executing dozens of search warrants.\n\nJBS is one of the companies at the center of Brazil\u2019s sprawling corruption investigation, known as Operation Car Wash, in which investigators have determined that companies paid billions of dollars in bribes and kickbacks to politicians in order to secure political favors and public contracts. Several JBS executives have confessed to the company\u2019s involvement in exchange for plea bargain deals, including providing evidence that underpinned charges levelled against President Michel Temer. Temer denies wrongdoing, and Congress twice voted to spare him trial while he is in office.\n\nBut prosecutors have since accused Batista of withholding information and revoked his deal.\n\n\u201cJoesley Batista is a collaborator with the justice system,\u201d Batista\u2019s lawyer, Andre Callegari, said in a statement. \u201cTherefore, the request for his arrest causes bewilderment in the context of an investigation in which he has already given more than one deposition as a cooperating witness and handed over innumerable corroborating documents.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Andrade\u2019s press office said that he had cooperated with police and his lawyers would respond once they had seen the details of the investigation.

(AP Photo/Timothy J. Gonzalez)\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 As Southern California piled up one victory after another in a 14-game winning streak against California, defensive supremacy has always been on the side of the Trojans.\n\nBut the Golden Bears have the far sturdier defense going into the Coliseum on Saturday, and with it comes their best chance at victory since the two programs emerged as the dominant forces in the Pac-10 during the mid-2000s.\n\nCal (5-4, 2-4 Pac-12) is reinventing itself as a team that relies on defense to win games in the second season under coach Justin Wilcox and defensive coordinator Tim DeRuyter. The Gold Bears are allowing 4.8 yards per play this season, which is tied with Kentucky for 22nd among FBS teams.\n\n\u201cScheme-wise, it is just a nightmare for a quarterback,\u201d USC coach Clay Helton said. \u201cThey mix it up really, really well and they are very well taught.\u201d\n\nCal is allowing 21.9 points per game, nearly half of what the defense conceded in its final season under coach Sonny Dykes in 2016. But that total includes six turnovers by Cal\u2019s offense that have been returned for touchdowns, circumstances that have Wilcox convinced his team can make a bowl game for the second time since 2012.\n\n\u201cWe talk about finishing all the time in everything we do,\u201d Wilcox said. \u201cJust in how you do everything, whether it\u2019s workouts or practice or meetings. It\u2019s not about maintenance. It\u2019s about we need to play our best football. We have yet to play our best game.\u201d\n\nFor USC (5-4, 4-3), a return visit to the Pac-12 title game is still in play with wins in its final two conference games and help elsewhere to remove possible tiebreakers against Utah and Arizona State. USC will have to keep its run game rolling against a rush defense that ranks third in the Pac-12, allowing 3.72 yards per carry. The Trojans are averaging 193.6 yards rushing in their five wins, including a season-high 332 yards in a 38-21 win at Oregon State in their last game.\n\n\u201cThe plays went because the line was executing and the backs were running hard,\u201d Helton said.\n\nHere are some other things to watch for when Cal and USC meet for the 106th time:\n\nSTILL ROTATING: Chase Garbers will start at quarterback for Cal, but Wilcox didn\u2019t rule out continuing to use redshirt sophomore Brandon McIlwain in certain situations. McIlwain is second on the team in yards rushing (402) and rushing touchdowns (4). However, the transfer from South Carolina has thrown eight interceptions and lost four fumbles. \u201cIt goes back to trying to create another play,\u201d Wilcox said. \u201cWe\u2019re still developing at that position. Both of those guys had some plays in the game they\u2019d love to have back. The quarterback\u2019s always going to be the center of attention, but we have to help him.\u201d\n\nDEPLETED DEFENSE: USC has been coping with limited numbers at safety for much of this season, and now attrition has hit the cornerbacks. Senior Iman Marshall is a game-time decision because of a sprained foot and ankle, while redshirt freshman Greg Johnson will not play because of a shoulder injury. Senior Isaiah Langley and redshirt senior Jonathan Lockett would start if Marshall is not available, with freshmen Olaijah Griffin and Isaac Taylor-Stuart backing them up.\n\nTWO-WAY PLAY?: The Bears might not have weapons at wide receiver that are capable of taking advantage of USC\u2019s secondary in its current state. Cal had three receivers transfer in the offseason, and juniors Kanawai Noa, Jordan Duncan and Brandon Singleton have missed time recently because of injuries. The situation is so bad that Wilcox has considered using safeties Ashtyn Davis and Jaylinn Hawkins on offense. Senior quarterback Chase Forrest could be an option at receiver. \u201cWe\u2019ve really talked about everything in terms of what\u2019s on the table to play at that position,\u201d Wilcox said. \u201cIt\u2019s not out of the question.\u201d\n\nCATCHING ON: With junior wide receiver Michael Pittman Jr. out after sustaining a shoulder injury against the Beavers, freshman Devon Williams is in line to see extensive playing time for the Trojans. Williams had three receptions for 77 yards at Oregon State, including a 41-yard touchdown catch for his first career score. Freshman Amon-Ra St. Brown, who has a team-high 38 receptions for 505 yards, will start in place of Pittman.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "TAYLORSVILLE, Ind.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump claimed on Friday that a White House-released video depicting contact between a staffer and a CNN reporter wasn\u2019t altered, and he seemingly threatened to revoke the White House press credentials of more reporters.\n\nTrump insisted that the video distributed by White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was simply a \u201cclose-up\u201d and \u201cwas not doctored.\u201d\n\n\u201cNobody manipulated it. All that is is a close-up,\u201d said the president, who then attacked the reporter for asking the question and called him \u201cdishonest.\u201d\n\nA frame-by-frame comparison with an Associated Press video of the same incident from Trump\u2019s postelection news conference Wednesday shows that the video tweeted by Sanders appears to speed up CNN reporter Jim Acosta\u2019s arm movement when he makes contact with a White House intern who was trying to take away Acosta\u2019s microphone. The speedup appears to make the gesture more threatening.\n\nTrump, in remarks Friday, also did not back off his administration\u2019s decision to suspend Acosta\u2019s press credential, which allows the CNN correspondent access to the White House grounds.\n\nAn independent video production trainer tells the AP a video tweeted by the White House on an interaction between CNN reporter Jim Acosta and an intern appears to have been manipulated to make the reporter's actions look more aggressive. (Nov. 8)\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a very unprofessional guy. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s a smart person but he has a loud voice,\u201d Trump told reporters in a testy 20-plus-minute exchange before he left for Paris and a World War I commemoration ceremony. \u201cYou have to treat the White House with respect. You have to treat the presidency with respect.\u201d\n\nThe president said he had not decided if Acosta\u2019s pass would be reinstated and he suggested there \u201ccould be others\u201d who lose their credentials. He belittled several of the reporters gathered around him. He said one had asked \u201ca stupid question,\u201d and he singled out April Ryan, a correspondent for Urban Radio Networks, calling her \u201cvery nasty\u201d and \u201ca loser.\u201d\n\nRyan, who is also a CNN contributor, tweeted in response: \u201cI love this country and have the most respect for the Office of the President. I will continue to ask the questions that affect America, all of America.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s latest attacks on the media came in the wake of his free-wheeling and contentious news conference two days earlier, and followed demands by several journalists and organizations \u2014 including the American Society of News Editors, the Associated Press Media Editors and the White House Correspondents Association \u2014 that Acosta\u2019s press pass be reinstated.\n\n\u201cIt is the essential function of a free press in every democracy to independently gather and report information in the public interest, a right that is enshrined in the First Amendment,\u201d said Julie Pace, AP\u2019s Washington bureau chief. \u201cWe strongly reject the idea that any administration would block a journalist\u2019s access to the White House.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times editorialized in favor of restoring Acosta\u2019s pass, saying it signaled Trump\u2019s view that asking hard questions disqualifies reporters from attending briefings. The newspaper said that if Sanders was so offended by physical contact, \u201cwhat did she have to say when her boss praised as \u2018my kind of guy\u2019 Rep. Greg Gianforte of Montana, who was sentenced to anger management classes and community service for body-slamming a Guardian reporter last spring?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s rare for the White House to pull the media credentials.\n\nDuring Lyndon Johnson\u2019s presidency, the Secret Service denied clearance to Robert Sherrill, a reporter for The Nation who had gotten into physical fights with government officials. During the George W. Bush presidency, Trude Feldman, who worked for various news outlets, was suspended for 90 days after security cameras recorded her looking through a press aide\u2019s desk late one night. In the 1970s, President Richard Nixon tried to get Washington Post reporters banned from the White House.\n\nDespite losing his White House pass, Acosta traveled to Paris this weekend to cover Trump\u2019s trip to meet with world leaders. He tweeted a photo of himself standing in front of the Eiffel Tower early Friday.\n\nAbba Shapiro, an independent video producer who examined the Wednesday footage at AP\u2019s request, noticed that frames in the tweeted video of the exchange at the news conference were frozen to slow down the action, allowing it to run the same length as the AP one.\n\nSanders, who hasn\u2019t said where the tweeted video came from, noted that it clearly shows Acosta made contact with the intern. In her statement announcing Acosta\u2019s suspension, she said the White House won\u2019t tolerate \u201ca reporter placing his hands on a young woman just trying to do her job.\u201d\n\nWhile the origin of the manipulated video is unclear, its distribution marked a new low for an administration that has been criticized for its willingness to mislead.\n\nCNN has labeled Sanders\u2019 characterization of Acosta\u2019s exchange with the intern as a lie. Its position has been supported by witnesses, including Reuters White House correspondent Jeff Mason, who was next to Acosta during the news conference and tweeted that he did not see Acosta place his hands on the White House employee.

(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky, File)\n\nA look at some key fantasy football questions for Week 10:\n\nWHICH UNDER THE RADAR PLAYERS HAVE THE BEST CHANCE FOR A BIG GAME THIS WEEK?\n\nSeveral Washington players \u2014 quarterback Alex Smith, running back Adrian Peterson, wide receiver Maurice Harris and tight end Vernon Davis \u2014 all have the potential to post big numbers this week against the Buccaneers.\n\nThe Bucs are top 6 or better in fantasy points allowed to each of the main offensive positions. Smith isn\u2019t a prototypical fantasy quarterback but the Bucs have given up multiple TDs to the position in six straight games.\n\nLook for Smith to connect often with Harris, who is coming off of a career-best performance with 10 catches for 124 yards receiving last week. With WR Paul Richardson out for the rest of the season and Jamison Crowder\u2019s status for Week 10 unclear, Harris should be heavily targeted and has an especially good matchup against a Buccaneers defense that has been torched by fellow slot receivers this season. If Crowder plays, Harris can still be productive on the outside.\n\nEven with the injuries to Washington\u2019s offensive line, Peterson should bounce back from his 16-yard performance in Week 9. Tampa Bay has allowed five TDs to running backs over the past two weeks.\n\nHe\u2019s expected to play, but tight end Jordan Reed has been limited in practices due to a back injury. He also hasn\u2019t scored a TD since Week 1 or recorded more than 43 receiving yards in five straight games. Davis caught five passes for 62 yards in Week 9 and has a favorable matchup against Tampa Bay, which has allowed the second most receiving yards to TEs.\n\nAnother QB to consider is Andy Dalton. He takes on the Saints, who\u2019ve allowed an average of 354 passing yards to QBs over the past three weeks.\n\nDalton will be without his top receiver A.J. Green, but John Ross has been practicing in full this week and has an opportunity for a big game against the Saints, who have given up the most fantasy points per game (FPPG) to WRs.\n\nAt running back, if Seattle\u2019s Chris Carson is either limited or out again in Week 10, Mike Davis has an opportunity for a big game. He faces the Rams, who\u2019ve allowed two TDs to RBs and at least 101 rushing yards in each of their last two games.\n\nSaints TE Ben Watson has scored TDs in two of his last three games and takes on the Bengals, who have allowed the second most FPPG to the position.\n\nHOW MUCH OF A FANTASY IMPACT WILL DEZ BRYANT HAVE WITH NEW ORLEANS?\n\nLet\u2019s face it, Bryant\u2019s skills had already been eroding for the past few seasons. It\u2019s not fair to expect too much from Bryant this season. Name recognition has put him back on the fantasy horizon. Asking a wideout who hasn\u2019t played a live NFL game since last December to step in, learn a new system and be fantasy productive right away is a bit much. Michael Thomas, Tre\u2019Quan Smith, Watson and Alvin Kamara will all easily get more targets on a weekly basis. We all know that QB Drew Brees already loves to spread the ball around.\n\nCAN 49ERS QB NICK MULLENS BUILD UPON LAST WEEK\u2019S PERFORMANCE AND IS HE STARTABLE IN WEEK 10?\n\nMullens has what appears to be a very good matchup in Week 10, however the 1-7 Giants have held opposing QBs to just one passing TD in each of the past two weeks. While WR Marquise Goodwin and TE George Kittle provide Mullens with potential TD makers, WR Pierre Garcon, his most targeted receiver last week, has been limited this week (knee) and his progress should be monitored. Mullens is definitely startable in two QB leagues, but he\u2019s a riskier play in other formats. He has a bye in Week 11, but if he\u2019s granted another start in Week 12, he\u2019ll take on the Buccaneers, and they\u2019ve given up the most FPPG to QBs entering Week 10.\n\nWHICH COLTS TIGHT END HAS MORE FANTASY VALUE FOR THE REST OF THE SEASON, JACK DOYLE OR ERIC EBRON?\n\nIt depends on your league\u2019s scoring format. Both have value, but in point-per-reception scoring leagues, Doyle will likely out-produce Ebron. With Doyle missing five games, QB Andrew Luck targeted Ebron 15 times in the red zone, tied for the fourth most in the NFL. However, Doyle averaged just over seven targets in the three games he\u2019s played this season. In those same three games, Ebron averaged just four targets.\n\nWHICH RUNNING BACKS HAVE UPSIDE BASED ON THEIR REST-OF-THE-SEASON OUTLOOK?\n\nCardinals running back David Johnson is an excellent buy-low candidate. Four of his last seven opponents are in the top 10 in FPPG allowed to opposing running backs.\n\nBears running back Jordan Howard has quietly had a productive season. His 3.5 yards per carry is underwhelming, but he\u2019s scored five TDs through his first eight games. He is seventh in the league with 20 red zone rushing attempts, and with an average of just under 16 carries per game, Howard is a major part of the Bears offensive scheme and will continue to have ample opportunities to be fantasy relevant.\n\n___\n\nFor more Week 10 fantasy tips and insights, please visit RotoExperts: https://rotoexperts.com", "President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump alight from Air Force One, after arriving at Orly airport near Paris, Friday, Nov. 9, 2018. Trump is joining other world leaders at centennial commemorations in Paris this weekend to mark the end of World War I. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\n\nPARIS (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump wasted no time taking a poke at his French host Friday as he arrived in Paris for events marking the 100th anniversary of the armistice that ended World War I, tweeting as he landed that President Emmanuel Macron had made an \u201cinsulting\u201d proposal to build up Europe\u2019s military to counter the U.S., China and Russia.\n\nIt was a clear sign that the \u201cAmerica first\u201d president was ready to chart his own course yet again as world leaders gathered to remember the coalition that brought an end to the first global war. Trump\u2019s visit comes on the heels of midterm elections in which Americans delivered a split referendum on his presidency, keeping the Senate in his party\u2019s control but ceding the House to opposition Democrats.\n\nHe planned to meet with Macron on Saturday for talks on topics expected to include European security, Syria and Iran. As he arrived, Trump tweeted that Macron \u201chas just suggested that Europe build its own military in order to protect itself from the U.S., China and Russia. Very insulting, but perhaps Europe should first pay its fair share of NATO, which the U.S. subsidizes greatly!\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s brief visit to Europe comes amid uncertainty about the U.S. relationship with the continent. Trump has railed against trade deals with the European Union and has criticized some EU nations, including France, for not spending enough to defense to sustain NATO, the decades-old Western alliance formed as a bulwark to Moscow\u2019s aggression.\n\nTrump\u2019s national security adviser, John Bolton, said Friday in Paris that the U.S. was concerned about stability in Europe and that Trump was not shirking from global engagement. \u201cI think the enduring lesson (of World War I) for the United States is that when you become a global power ... you have global interests to protect,\u201d Bolton said. \u201cGreat world leaders,\u201d he said, are \u201cdriven by national interests.\u201d\n\nFor Sunday\u2019s armistice anniversary, Trump was to join world leaders at a ceremony in the shadow of the Arc de Triomphe.\n\n\u201cIt should be a very beautiful period of time, the 100th anniversary of the ending of World War I. We have many countries \u2014 the leadership from many countries will be there, especially since they heard the United States will be there. And we look forward to that,\u201d Trump told reporters Friday before leaving the White House. \u201cI\u2019ve seen what they have planned, and I think it\u2019s going to be something very, very special.\u201d\n\nTrump originally wanted to celebrate Veterans Day on Sunday with a grand military parade in Washington, as he was inspired by the tanks and flyovers he saw during France\u2019s Bastille Day celebration when he visited Paris in July of last year. Trump ordered the Pentagon to come up with plans for his own version, but they were eventually scrapped over concerns about costs and the damage tanks weighing many tons would do to the streets in Washington.\n\nTrump and Macron\u2019s early relationship was marked by kisses, frequent meetings and marathon power handshakes. Early on, Macron tried to position himself as a sort of \u201cTrump whisperer\u201d and Trump returned the favor, hosting Macron at the first and only state dinner of his presidency. But the relationship-building failed to persuade Trump to remain in the global climate change or Iran deals and did nothing to protect France from U.S. tariffs.\n\nThe dividends of Macron\u2019s cultivation of Trump are \u201cmodest at best,\u201d said Stewart M. Patrick, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nAt the same time, Macron has increasingly been positioning himself as a bulwark against the rising tide of Trump-style populism across Europe, speaking out loudly against the dangers of nationalism and isolationist retreat.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s starting to become the antithesis of President Trump\u2019s public messaging,\u201d said Heather Conley, director of the Europe program at Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nThe president and first lady Melania Trump were expected to visit several memorial sites in France that are dedicated to American service members. Not on Trump\u2019s schedule, despite earlier discussions about the possibility, was an extended meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that we\u2019re seeing each other in Paris, but we may,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThere may be a lunch for the leaders.\u201d\n\nThe White House and the Kremlin had previously considered a formal meeting in Paris. That now seems more likely for later this month, when they attend the Group of 20 summit of international leaders in Argentina.\n\nTrump and Putin have met previously on the sidelines of two summits and had their own bilateral meeting in July in Helsinki. At that meeting, Trump would not say whether he believed Putin or U.S. intelligence agencies about their conclusions about Russia\u2019s interference with the 2016 presidential election.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Jonathan Lemire in New York and Elaine Ganley in Paris contributed to this report.", "Texas teen on ATV records chase as officers pursue him\n\nHOUSTON (AP) \u2014 A 15-year-old boy who videoed himself being chased by police as he drove an ATV along Houston-area freeways has been apprehended and placed in the custody of juvenile authorities.\n\nOfficers tried to pull the boy over Thursday because it\u2019s illegal to ride an ATV on public roads.

Saturday November 3 2018. (Matt Gentry/The Roanoke Times via AP)\n\nBOSTON (AP) \u2014 The best Boston College team in a decade is standing in the way of No. 2 Clemson\u2019s fourth straight trip to the Atlantic Coast Conference championship game.\n\nThe 17th-ranked Eagles have frosty weather and \u2014 they hope \u2014 running back A.J.

They have outscored their opponents by 204 points over the last four games \u2014 also a league record \u2014 including a 77-16 victory over Louisville last week.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been racking off a bunch of records and things that haven\u2019t been done,\u201d Scott said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe there\u2019s been an ACC team with four (straight) division trophies since they started the two divisions. So that\u2019s something our guys will have an opportunity to accomplish.\u201d\n\nA BC win would leave the schools tied for the division lead, giving the Eagles (7-2, 4-1, No. 17 CFP) a chance to reach the ACC title game for the first time since Matt Ryan led them to the first of back-to-back appearances in 2007-08. For those who were here when the team went winless in the ACC in 2015, it\u2019s the payoff for the hard work through the bad years.\n\n\u201cGuys are playing with a little bit more of a chip on their shoulder, as you would expect with a big game coming up,\u201d said linebacker Connor Strachan, a fifth-year senior. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting to play the game you love, but with a little weight behind it.\u201d\n\nHere are some other things to look for in Saturday night\u2019s game:\n\nWILL HE OR WON\u2019T HE\n\nDillon, the ACC preseason player of the year after rushing for 1,589 yards as a freshman, has gained 897 yards in seven games so far this season, missing two with a left ankle injury.\n\nIn his absence, Ben Glines ran for 90 yards against North Carolina State and 107 against Louisville; David Bailey had 112 yards rushing against the Cardinals. Against Virginia Tech, when Dillon tweaked the injury but still racked up 96 yards, Travis Levy took over the responsibilities and ran 11 times for 75 yards.\n\nBC coach Steve Addazio is hoping Dillon will serve as the feature back against Clemson.\n\n\u201cI would say we need all of them, but certainly one guy you would like to have ready to go is No. 2,\u201d he said. \u201cA.J., God-willing, will be healthy again, and we can get 30 carries out of him.\u201d\n\nClemson held Dillon to 57 yards last year and a 3.2 yards per carry average that was one of his worst of his career. The Tigers lead the nation this year in rushing defense, allowing just 2.24 yards per carry.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to need that,\u201d coach Dabo Swinney said. \u201cThese guys know how to run the football.\u201d\n\nCOLD COMFORT\n\nForecasts of temperatures near freezing aren\u2019t scaring Tigers quarterback Trevor Lawrence, who is from Tennessee and has never been north of Virginia. (Clemson\u2019s road games his freshman year have been at Texas A&M, Georgia Tech, Wake Forest and Florida State.)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fun going on the road, experiencing things. New places,\u201d Lawrence said. \u201cWe know it\u2019s in Boston and it\u2019s going to be cold.

When the spoiler was removed from his No. 4 Ford during an extensive inspection in North Carolina, NASCAR discovered the part had been altered.\n\nIt is NASCAR\u2019s belief that SHR built its own spoiler and tried to pass it off as one distributed by the vendor. The spoiler was offset to the right and NASCAR says it gave Harvick an aerodynamic advantage.\n\nSHR did not appeal the penalty and acknowledged \u201cNASCAR determined we ventured into an area not accommodated by its rule book.\u201d\n\nChilders elaborated in a series of tweets early Friday morning in which he said SHR made the decision to move the spoiler after other teams shifted their decklids and spoilers to the right in the previous 1.5-mile race at Kansas Speedway. Childers said it was too late for the team to move the decklid for the Texas race.\n\n\u201cThis year there isn\u2019t a number or officiating on the offset of the decklid and spoiler together on the car. And at Kansas we noticed people we were racing had the spoilers and decklids further to the right than ours. And it was too late to move the decklid over more,\u201d Childers posted on Twitter.\n\nAdditional posts claimed the downforce advantage was \u201c4 counts. That\u2019s 0.04% of the total downforce of the car. If you think 4 counts is the reason we won you\u2019re way wrong.\u201d\n\nHe also said there were no hard feelings between NASCAR and SHR, which has all four of its drivers still eligible for the playoffs and has been the most dominant organization in NASCAR all season.\n\nHarvick leads the series with eight victories, but two were with illegal cars. His Las Vegas victory from earlier this year was disqualified, as was last week\u2019s Texas win. That disqualification cost Harvick his automatic berth into next weekend\u2019s championship race and Childers and car chief Robert Smith are suspended.\n\nHarvick is still mathematically in contention to advance into the final four and he\u2019s a nine-time winner at Phoenix, site of Sunday\u2019s final championship-qualifying event. He won at Phoenix earlier this year.\n\nHarvick, the 2014 champion, had no scheduled media availability at ISM Raceway but was required to attend a news conference after winning the pole. He was contentious as he declined to delve into the scandal surrounding his team, but praised the organization for its strong effort Friday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more about people than it is about cars and we\u2019ve got a lot of good people,\u201d Harvick said. \u201cYou can\u2019t drive a slow car fast and you can\u2019t beat good people.\u201d\n\nJoey Logano, the only driver already locked into next week\u2019s title race, was not bothered by the accusations against Harvick\u2019s team. He also said he\u2019s not wondering if SHR, or others, have been cheating all year.\n\n\u201cEveryone pushes hard and it\u2019s nothing new,\u201d Logano said. \u201cWe like making a big deal out of it, a big stink out of it, but honestly it is part of our sport. There are a lot more items on our cars than there is in football. As competitors we push to that edge and sometimes we go a little over the edge and sometimes it\u2019s all about the way you interpret the rulebook.\u201d\n\nLogano missed the playoffs last year because his only victory of the season was disqualified when his car failed inspection. That infraction at Richmond in the ninth race of the season haunted Logano\u2019s team the entire season.\n\nHe\u2019s not expecting the fallout from the SHR penalty to slow Harvick, who typically elevates his game during times of crisis.\n\nHarvick\u2019s 2014 championship season had brief drama because he shoved Brad Keselowski into a scrum to trigger a melee between Keselowski, Jeff Gordon and their crews. The next week, facing elimination if he didn\u2019t win at Phoenix, Harvick dominated the race and advanced into the championship finale.\n\nHe won at Homestead to claim his first Cup title the next week.\n\nHarvick was runner-up the next season \u2014 a year in which he deliberately caused a wreck at Talladega to prevent a bad day hurting his title chances \u2014 and is trying to requalify for the finale for the fourth time in five years.\n\nLogano thinks Harvick will be steady this weekend and the biggest deficit the team is facing is not having Childers at the track to lead the team. Childers is banned from the garage but can be in communication with his crew. He said on Twitter he plans on putting in 14-hour work days at the North Carolina shop this weekend. It is possible he could be on property at Homestead-Miami Speedway for the finale.\n\n\u201cI think if there is going to be a hiccup, it\u2019s not gonna be on Kevin\u2019s part,\u201d Logano said. \u201cI think Kevin is the type of driver that rises to the occasion. There can be a hiccup in communication. Obviously, they\u2019ll be in communication with Rodney ... but it\u2019s not going to be very quick. You know the way things get lost in translation sometimes on the phone compared to being face-to-face.\n\n\u201cYou are going to have those situations, and it\u2019s for the next two races. I\u2019d say it\u2019s a big hit for them, but I\u2019d also feel like that car is going to make it through (to Homestead) as fast as they are and going to their best race track.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP Auto Racing: https://apnews.com/apf-AutoRacing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "", "", "", "FILE - In this Oct. 13, 2018, file photo, Michigan quarterback Shea Patterson (2) tries to scramble away from Wisconsin inside linebacker T.J. Edwards (53) during the second quarter of an NCAA college football game in Ann Arbor, Mich. Patterson and the Wolverines face Penn State this week. (AP Photo/Tony Ding, File)\n\nMichigan is on the cusp of reaching the heights expected when it hired Jim Harbaugh.\n\nIt took four seasons and a handful of crushing defeats to get here but the fourth-ranked Wolverines (8-1, 6-0 Big Ten, No. 4 CFP) are poised to win their first conference title since 2004.\n\nStay out of the loss column, and the Wolverines could play for their first national title since 1997.\n\nRutgers (1-8, 0-6) should provide nothing more than a simple tuneup Saturday in New Jersey, as will Indiana next week at the Big House before Michigan closes the regular season at No. 8 Ohio State.\n\nThe Wolverines, who haven\u2019t lost since the season opener against No. 3 Notre Dame, would have to beat the Buckeyes for just the second time in 15 years to keep any hope at a national title alive. It might take a miracle for Rutgers to beat Michigan, but the Wolverines (48\u00bd-point favorites) also don\u2019t want to mess around and play a close game against one of the worst teams in FBS.\n\nNorthwestern was the last team to come close to beating the Wolverines, jumping out to a 17-0 first-half lead on Sept. 29. Since then, Michigan has outscored the opposition 163-48.\n\nNot bad, but consider Michigan probably could have hit that scoring mark against Rutgers the last time it traveled to Jersey: the Wolverines humiliated Rutgers 78-0 and the fear around Piscataway is that it could happen again. Michigan had nine rushing touchdowns and 600 total yards (vs. 39 for Rutgers) in the rout and Harbaugh leads an even better, dangerous team into town this season.\n\nMichigan was 111th in yards passing per game last season and the Wolverines dipped to 8-5. Former Mississippi star Shea Patterson has provided Harbaugh the quarterback he has been looking for since coming back to his alma mater. Patterson is coming off his fourth, three-touchdown game of the season and was named a finalist this week for the Davey O\u2019Brien Award. Patterson has thrown for 1,667 yards with 14 touchdowns and is on the board at Las Vegas with the third-best odds to win the Heisman Trophy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not surprised that the improvement has taken place,\u201d Harbaugh said. \u201cHe\u2019s just getting comfortable with playing in this system. It\u2019s been all good since the first day he got here.\u201d\n\nPatterson just may be the QB that Michigan has needed to win the national championship.\n\n\u201cHe brings a level of focus and mental toughness, a level of intensity to the position that few do,\u201d Harbaugh said.\n\nHere are other items of note for Saturday\u2019s game:\n\nYIKES\n\nHow bad is Rutgers? Kansas, which beat the Scarlet Knights 52-3 in September, will let go coach David Beaty at the end of the season. The hottest ash around Rutgers could be the hot seat that coach Chris Ash sits on as the season winds down. Ash couldn\u2019t even muster an underdog rallying cry for his team to knock off the Wolverines, simply stating he just wanted the Scarlet Knights to improve. Hey, at least a field goal will do the trick from the last home game two years ago.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re probably playing as good as any team in the country,\u201d Ash said. \u201cIn the years that I\u2019ve coached against Michigan, it\u2019s probably one of the best teams they\u2019ve had.\u201d\n\nIT\u2019S NOT ALL BAD\n\nHarbaugh actually didn\u2019t have to reach to pay Rutgers a compliment.\n\n\u201cTheir kickoff coverage is really impressive,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the best in the nation.\u201d\n\nGuess what? It\u2019s true! The Scarlet Knights have allowed a tight 14.88 yards per kick return. Only Eastern Michigan has been stingier on stuffing teams on the kickoff.\n\nIt\u2019s the rest of the game of football that gives Rutgers fits. The Scarlet Knights are 128th in total offense and 82nd in total defense out of the 130 FBS teams. Rutgers will host a top-five opponent for the 13th time in program history. The Scarlet Knights haven\u2019t beat a ranked team since a win over No. 23 USF in 2009.\n\nJERSEY BOYS\n\nNine Wolverines are from New Jersey: OL Juwann Bushell-Beatty, OL Kraig Correll, DL Michael Dwumfour, DL Rashan Gary, DB Brad Hawkins, DL Ron Johnson, DB Hunter Reynolds, OL Cesar Ruiz and OL Jon Runyan.\n\nBACKUP PLAN\n\nIf Michigan has a big lead in the second half, the backup QB may get some much-needed snaps. Patterson\u2019s backup, Dylan McCaffrey, broke his collarbone in last week\u2019s win over Penn State. Harbaugh said Brandon Peters and Joe Milton will compete for the job, adding he would rather have Milton save his redshirt eligibility.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "CLAYTON, Mo.

(Nov. 9)\n\n___\n\n5:10 p.m.\n\nU.S. Sen. Bill Nelson says his Republican challenger, Florida Gov. Rick Scott, fears that he will lose the election if all the votes are counted.\n\nNelson said Friday afternoon that Scott is impeding the democratic process and trying to stop all the votes for Florida\u2019s U.S. Senate race from being counted.\n\nScott has filed lawsuits against elections officials in Broward and Palm Beach counties and asked state law enforcement to investigate possible fraud. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement says no elections fraud allegations have been made, and there isn\u2019t an active investigation.\n\nScott said Thursday night that Democrats are continuing to find votes until they get the results they want.\n\nNelson responded that \u201cvotes are not being found; they\u2019re being counted.\u201d\n\n___\n\n4:05 p.m.\n\nA Broward County judge has ordered the immediate release of voter information sought by Florida Gov.

Phillips found that Snipes violated that law by failing to turn over the information to attorneys for Scott\u2019s Senate campaign and the National Republican Senatorial Committee.\n\nLawyers for Snipes argued that requiring such a swift response would interfere with ongoing efforts to finish counting Broward County ballots. But lawyers for Scott contended the information is already required to be collected under state law and should take minutes to provide.\n\nThe information sought includes ballots not yet reviewed by the Canvassing Board, absentee ballots and early voting ballots.\n\n___\n\n3:25 p.m.\n\nA spokeswoman says state law enforcement officials in Florida have not launched any elections-fraud allegations. The statement came a day after Republican Gov.

Rick Scott, who ran against Democratic incumbent U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson. Scott declared victory in Tuesday\u2019s election, but Nelson has not conceded and ballot-counting continues. The race remains too close to call, with Nelson narrowly trailing Scott.\n\nNelson and the Florida Democratic Party are suing to prevent elections officials statewide from throwing out mail-in votes and provisional ballots. They also have asked a federal court to extend the deadline for counties to submit unofficial election results.\n\nZeckman said Friday that the lawsuit is asking the court \u201cto overrule election officials and accept ballots that were not legally cast.\u201d\n\nEarlier Friday, Nelson lawyer Marc Elias criticized Scott for suggesting that he might get the state government involved.\n\nElias said it was \u201cnot appropriate\u201d for a governor to suggest he was going to \u201cinterject his law enforcement authority to prevent the counting of ballots that have been legally cast.\u201d\n\n____\n\n1 p.m.\n\nA group of about 30 sign-holding Republican protesters gathered outside the office of Broward County Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes, singing \u201cThe Star Spangled Banner\u201d and \u201cGod Bless America.\u201d\n\nAs the counting of ballots resumed Friday afternoon, Republican U.S. Rep.

Bill Nelson criticized Republican Gov. Rick Scott for using his official position to try to influence ballot counting as the two face a potential hand recount in the too-close-to-call Senate race.\n\nDuring a Thursday night news conference, Scott announced he is suing the Palm Beach and Broward county supervisors of elections, saying \u201cthere may be rampant fraud\u201d in the counties that heavily favor Democrats. He\u2019s asked the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to investigate.\n\nOn Friday, Nelson lawyer Marc Elias shot back at Scott on a conference call with reporters, saying \u201cJust look at the behavior of your governor.\u201d\n\nElias says it\u2019s \u201cnot appropriate\u201d for a governor to suggest he\u2019s going to use his powers to \u201cinterject his law enforcement authority to prevent the counting of ballots that have been legally cast.\u201d\n\n___\n\n8:55 a.m.\n\nA court in South Florida has been asked to intervene in the tight U.S. Senate race between Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson and Republican Florida Gov. Rick Scott as the two sides prepare for a possible recount. A hearing was set for 3 p.m. in state court.\n\nScott filed lawsuit against Broward County Supervisors of Election Brenda Snipes Thursday night, asking the court to order Snipes to turn over several records detailing the counting and collection of ballots. Scott\u2019s thin lead over Nelson has narrowed in the vote-counting in the days since he declared victory on Tuesday night.\n\nWithout citing any evidence of wrongdoing, Scott also asked Florida Department of Law Enforcement to investigate elections offices in the Democratic strongholds of Palm Beach and Broward counties, questioning whether they have been taking too long in some sort of effort to inflate the Democratic vote.\n\n____\n\n12:42 a.m.\n\nRazor-thin margins in Florida\u2019s bitter races for the U.S. Senate and governor are raising the possibility of recounts, potentially prolonging two of the most closely watched contests of the nation\u2019s midterm elections.\n\nIn the governor\u2019s race, Democrat Andrew Gillum\u2019s campaign said Thursday it\u2019s readying for a possible recount. He conceded to Republican Ron DeSantis on Tuesday night, though the race has since tightened. DeSantis led Gillum by 0.47 percentage point as of Thursday afternoon.\n\nMeanwhile, Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson has begun preparing for a potential recount in a race that is still too close to call against Republican Gov. Rick Scott.

The State Department said it was reviewing the decision, but declined further comment, citing ongoing litigation.\n\nThe pipeline was first proposed by Calgary-based TransCanada in 2008. It has become the focal point of a decade-long dispute that pits Democrats, environmental groups and Native American tribes who warn of pollution and increased greenhouse gas emissions against business groups and Republicans who cheer the project\u2019s jobs and potential energy production.\n\nU.S. District Judge Brian Morris put a hold on the project late Thursday, ruling that the State Department had not fully considered potential oil spills and other impacts as required by federal law. He ordered the department to complete a new review that addresses issues that have emerged since the last environmental review was completed in 2014.\n\nNew topics include the cumulative effects of climate-changing greenhouse gas emissions of Keystone XL and a related pipeline that brings oil from Canada; the effects of current oil prices on the pipeline\u2019s viability; updated modeling of potential oil spills; and the project\u2019s effect on cultural resources of native tribes and other groups along the pipeline\u2019s route.\n\nThe review could take up to a year to complete.\n\nEnvironmentalists and Native American groups had sued to stop the project, citing property rights and possible spills.\n\nBecky Mitchell, chairwoman of the Northern Plains Resource Council, a plaintiff in the case, said her organization is thrilled with the ruling.\n\n\u201cThis decision sends TransCanada back to the drawing board,\u201d Mitchell said, calling the ruling \u201cthe results of grassroots democracy in action, winning for water and people.\u201d\n\nTransCanada said in a statement that it was reviewing the judge\u2019s 54-page decision. \u201cWe remain committed to building this important energy infrastructure project,\u201d TransCanada spokesman Terry Cunha said.\n\nEnvironmental groups declared victory and predicted the long-delayed project will never be built.\n\nThe court ruling \u201cmakes it clear once and for all that it\u2019s time for TransCanada to give up on their Keystone XL pipe dream,\u201d said Doug Hayes, a senior attorney with the Sierra Club, the nation\u2019s largest environmental group.\n\nThe fight over the project has spanned several presidencies and involved standoffs between protesters and law enforcement.\n\nAfter years of legal wrangling, Obama rejected a permit for the pipeline in 2015. The company responded by seeking $15 billion in damages.\n\nTrump signed executive actions to again advance construction of the project in 2017.\n\nTransCanada had recently announced plans to start construction next year, after a State Department review ordered by Morris concluded that major environmental damage from a leak is unlikely and could quickly be mitigated. Morris said that review was inadequate.\n\nTransCanada has promised continuous monitoring and says automatic shut-off valves would help officials quickly identify a leak or rupture.\n\nTom Goldtooth, executive director for the Indigenous Environmental Network, a Minnesota-based advocacy group that also is a plaintiff in the case, said the ruling was a win for tribes, water \u201cand for the sacredness of Mother Earth.\u201d\n\nHe called the pipeline \u201cthe enemy of the people, the climate and life as we know it.

(AP Photo/Adel Hana)\n\nGAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) \u2014 Gaza\u2019s Hamas rulers lauded on Friday what they described as a gain of their weekly protests along Gaza-Israel perimeter fence, which have often turned deadly, after receiving $15 million from Qatar to help pay the salaries of the territory\u2019s civil servants.\n\n\u201cToday, we see some fruits of the protests \u2014 the partial breaking of the siege on Gaza,\u201d Khalil al-Hayya, a senior Hamas official, told reporters at a protest in east Gaza City, referring to the grant. \u201cWe are still waiting for the implementation of all other understandings.\u201d\n\nSince March, the Islamic militant group has orchestrated weekly demonstrations along the fence, in large part against a blockade Israel and Egypt imposed when it seized Gaza in 2007.\n\nQatar, Egypt and the United Nations, acting as go-betweens for Hamas and Israel, intensified their shuttle diplomacy in recent weeks after a full-blown war between Hamas and Israel appeared imminent.\n\nThe Qatari grant is part of indirect Hamas-Israel understandings to improve living conditions for Gaza\u2019s 2 million people and subsequently scale down the border protests, in which 170 Palestinians and an Israeli soldier have been killed since they began in March.\n\nThe closure squeezed Hamas financially. Recent budget cuts by the West Bank-based administration of President Mahmoud Abbas have worsened the situation for Gaza\u2019s rulers, preventing them from paying complete salaries to their 40,000 employees.\n\nBut on Thursday, a Qatari envoy brought the money through Israel in three suitcases. They were the first installment of $90 million that Qatar has pledged to cover salaries and other humanitarian operations for six months.\n\nEmployees reporting to the group lined up outside Hamas-affiliated banks and post offices \u2014 typically shut for the weekend on Fridays \u2014 to receive 60 percent of their long-overdue salaries. In recent months, they had instead received smaller stipends every 40 days. Hamas says the monthly disbursements will gradually increase.\n\nAlongside the cash deliveries, Hamas demands an expansion of the permissible fishing zone off Gaza beach, uninterrupted flow of fuel to mitigate chronic power shortages and the lifting of Israeli restrictions on exports and imports, a Hamas official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.\n\nFor the second week in a row, the Palestinians kept Friday\u2019s protests carefully restrained, burning fewer tires and refraining from breaching the fence to avoid drawing a lethal response from the Israeli military.\n\nHowever, a 28-year-old who was seriously injured by Israeli fire during the marches later died at a hospital, according to the health ministry. It added that 37 Palestinians were wounded from live gunfire.\n\nThe Qatari mediator, Mohammed Al-Emadi, visited a protest camp in east Gaza City, where he was welcomed by Hamas officials.", "THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) \u2014 Dutch officials said Friday they will prosecute a nursing home doctor for euthanizing an elderly woman with dementia, the first time a doctor has been charged since the Netherlands legalized euthanasia in 2002.\n\nDutch prosecutors said in a statement the doctor \u201chad not acted carefully\u201d and \u201coverstepped a line\u201d when she performed euthanasia. Officials first began probing the case in September, when they found the doctor had drugged the patient\u2019s coffee and then had family members hold her down while delivering the fatal injection.\n\nThe doctor said she was fulfilling the patient\u2019s earlier euthanasia request and that since the patient was not competent, nothing the woman said during her euthanasia procedure was relevant.\n\nBut Dutch prosecutors argued that the patient\u2019s written euthanasia request was \u201cunclear and contradictory.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn her living will, the woman wrote that she wanted to be euthanized \u2018whenever I think the time is right.\u2019 But after being asked several times in the nursing home whether she wanted to die, she said, \u2018Not just now, it\u2019s not so bad yet,\u2018\u201d according to an earlier report by one of the Netherlands\u2019 euthanasia review committees.\n\n\u201cEven if the patient had said at that moment: \u2018I don\u2019t want to die,\u2019 the physician would have continued,\u201d the committee wrote, citing the doctor\u2019s own testimony.\n\nProsecutors said on Friday that the doctor should have verified with the patient whether or not she still wanted to die and that \u201cthe fact that she had become demented does not alter this.\u201d\n\nJohan Legemaate, a professor of health law at the University of Amsterdam, said: \u201cThe patient\u2019s declaration has to be clear enough to the situation so doctors know when euthanasia can be applied.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut should this include a situation where doctors are drugging patients secretly? It\u2019s now for the court to decide whether this doctor acted within the required limits,\u201d he added.\n\nLegemaate said that there were very few cases of euthanasia in patients with advanced dementia, but that the decision to prosecute the doctor in this case might provoke more caution among health professionals.\n\nRene Heman, chairman of the Dutch Doctors Federation, said he respected how open the doctor had been about the case.\n\n\u201cCriminal law is always the last possible resort after a report of euthanasia,\u201d he said, noting that euthanizing people with advanced dementia continued to be very controversial.\n\nThe Netherlands is one of five countries that allow doctors to kill patients at their request, and one of two, along with Belgium, that grant the procedure for people with mental illness. For those with late-stage dementia, euthanasia is still possible if the person made a written demand specifying the conditions under which they want to be killed and if other criteria are met, namely if the doctor agrees the patient is suffering unbearably with no prospect of improvement.\n\n\u201cIf the Dutch had decided not to prosecute this case, that would send a message that if a patient is incompetent, doctors can essentially do whatever they want,\u201d said Scott Kim, an ethicist at the U.S. National Institutes of Health.\n\n\u201cA case like this should serve as a warning for other countries,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Dutch seem to be recognizing that certain practices are out of bounds.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, friends of Audrey Parker, a euthanasia advocate in Canada, which legalized the procedure in 2016, said she was forced to end her life \u201cprematurely\u201d because the law only allows patients who are mentally competent to be killed.\n\nA pro-euthanasia organization said it would soon be launching a campaign to challenge the Canadian law so that people can be euthanized even when they lack capacity.\n\nDutch prosecutors are also examining two other criminal investigations into doctors who performed euthanasia in questionable circumstances; two other cases were recently dropped.\n\n___\n\nCheng reported from London.", "FILE - In this March 30, 2018, file photo, a Pakistani Christian woman prays during a Good Friday service at a church in Islamabad, Pakistan.

(AP Photo/B.K. Bangash, File)\n\nISLAMABAD (AP) \u2014 The uproar surrounding Aasia Bibi \u2014 a Pakistani Christian woman who was acquitted of blasphemy charges and released from death row but remains at a secret location for her protection \u2014 has drawn attention to the plight of the country\u2019s Christians.\n\nThe minority, among Pakistan\u2019s poorest, has faced an increasingly intolerant atmosphere in this Muslim-majority nation where radical religious and sectarian groups have become more prominent in recent years.\n\nHere is a look at some of the issues involved.\n\n___\n\nWHY HER RELEASE IGNITED AN UPROAR\n\nBibi\u2019s Oct. 31 acquittal by Pakistan\u2019s supreme court triggered large-scale protests, with religious extremists demanding the 54-year-old mother of five be publicly executed \u2014 and that the three judges who set her free also be put to death.\n\nHer ordeal started in 2009 after two fellow women farmworkers refused to drink from the same container as a Christian, and later said Bibi had insulted the Prophet Muhammad. The claim led to her arrest and 2010 death sentence on blasphemy charges. In Pakistan, a mere accusation of blasphemy has caused riots, even lynching.\n\nRights groups have said Pakistan\u2019s blasphemy law is often used as an excuse to settle scores, or as a weapon against religious minorities, including Shiite Muslims who are at times targeted by Sunni Muslim militants as heretics.\n\nBibi has been in hiding in Islamabad since her release earlier this week. Her family says she will leave Pakistan as soon as possible because of death threats against her.\n\n___\n\nWHO THE PAKISTANI CHRISTIANS ARE\n\nThere are about 1.3 million Christians in Pakistan, a predominantly Sunni Muslim country of 204 million people. The Christians are the second-largest minority, after Hindus, and are almost evenly divided between Catholic and Protestant denominations.\n\nThe Christian population grew at the time of Pakistan\u2019s creation in 1947, when the Indian subcontinent was divided into two nations. At the time, many lower caste Hindus, living in what would become Pakistan, converted to Christianity. They were among the region\u2019s poorest and held jobs many others didn\u2019t want.\n\nAlthough some Christians have risen to senior positions, including A.R. Cornelius who served as Pakistan\u2019s chief justice, many live in impoverished communities commonly referred to as \u201csweeper colonies\u201d because residents are employed as domestic and sanitation workers.\n\n___\n\nHOW PAKISTAN\u2019S GOVERNMENTS HAVE TREATED CHRISTIANS\n\nThe rise of Islamic radicalism in Pakistan has left the country\u2019s minority religions vulnerable. The blasphemy law, which carries the death penalty for anyone convicted of insulting Islam, has been used at times as a tool against minorities. Christian churches and homes have been attacked by crowds invoking the law.\n\nPrime Minister Imran Khan, elected in July, in part on an Islamic agenda, has vacillated between criticizing religious parties for using religion to enhance their influence, and bowing to their demands, including firing minorities from government-appointed positions.\n\nIn Bibi\u2019s case, Khan seemingly caved to the Islamists\u2019 demand to have her acquittal reviewed in an appeal \u2014 though some suspected he was trying to buy time to disperse the protesters.\n\nAnalysts say mixed signals from the government only embolden extremists. Minority religious leaders also say the poverty of the Christian minority sharply reduces their political clout.\n\n___\n\nHOW CHRISTIANS ARE FARING IN OTHER MUSLIM-MAJORITY COUNTRIES\n\nEgypt\u2019s Christians, who make up about 10 percent of the country\u2019s 100 million Muslim-majority population, have long complained of discrimination and under-representation in government. Sectarian violence occasionally erupts in rural communities where Christian churches have been torched. Overwhelmingly, attacks on Egyptian Copts have been carried out by Islamist extremists, mainly the Islamic State group, which has killed scores of Christians in recent years.\n\nLebanon\u2019s Christian community is the second-largest in the Middle East, after Egypt\u2019s, but has gone from being a majority to ranging between 30 and 35 percent of the population. Despite their dwindling numbers, Lebanese Christians still retain relative political power with multiple political parties and a president, who must be a Christian Maronite, according to an unwritten national pact.\n\nAcross the Holy Land, Christians now make up an estimated 1 to 2 percent of the population, a marked decline over the decades. Reasons include a relatively low birth rate and increased emigration by Palestinian Christians, driven by the fallout from the long-running conflict with Israel. In the Gaza Strip, the number of Christians has dropped from 3,000 to 1,000 over the past decade of rule by the Islamic militant group Hamas \u2014 a period that has been marked by armed conflict with Israel, border closures and soaring unemployment.\n\nIraq has been seeing a dramatic exodus of its Christians since dictator Saddam Hussein was ousted in 2003. Muslim extremists, mostly from the al-Qaida terror network and later the Islamic State group, have bombed churches and shrines in Baghdad and the city of Mosul, and assassinated high-level bishops and priests. There were thought to be over 1 million Christians living in Iraq before the U.S.-led invasion of 2003; today only a fraction remains.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Menna Zaki in Cairo, Philip Issa in Baghdad, Fares Akram in Gaza City, Gaza Strip, and Zeina Karam in Beirut contributed to this report.", "In this July 6, 2011 file photo, actors, from left, Emma Watson and Tom Felton pose at St Pancras Renaissance Hotel in central London. \u201cHarry Potter\u201d co-stars Emma Watson and Tom Felton went for a ride on a skateboard.

The coalition intervened in Yemen in March 2015 with the aim of defeating the Iran-aligned rebels and to restore the government of Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi. But the coalition has recently come under mounting international pressure to end the war that has resulted in what the U.N. says is the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis.\n\nThe fighting around the city, a vital lifeline for most of Yemen\u2019s population, threatens to worsen Yemen\u2019s already-dire humanitarian situation and risks the obstruction of crucial assistance to the country endangering the lives of millions of Yemenis.\n\nThe Norwegian Refugee Council warned of the repercussions the continued fighting may have on millions of Yemenis. The council estimates the humanitarian cost of the war to have reached almost $3 billion in 2018 alone, it said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe are now warning that by allowing this to go on, parties to the conflict and their international backers will be responsible for the death, injury and suffering of millions of people,\u201d Mohamed Abdi, the council\u2019s director in Yemen, said in a statement. \u201cSenseless attacks on civilians, evidence of a starving population and desperate pleas from humanitarian witnesses have done little more than elicit condolences from an international community that could have stepped on the brakes long ago.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. and U.K., major arms suppliers to the Saudi coalition, have recently called for a cease-fire in Yemen and the launch of U.N.-led political talks to end the Saudi-Iran proxy war.

(AP Photo/Christophe Ena, File)\n\nPARIS (AP) \u2014 France\u2019s prime minister sounded the alarm Friday over a sharp rise in anti-Semitic acts this year, pledging to increase efforts to punish perpetrators and police hate speech that is flourishing online.\n\nResurgent anti-Semitism is of national concern in a country with Europe\u2019s largest Jewish population, which still struggles to wash away the stain of collaboration with the Nazis and in recent years has seen deadly Islamic extremist attacks targeting Jewish sites.\n\nPrime Minister Edouard Philippe announced on his Facebook page a 69 percent rise in the number of anti-Semitic acts reported to police in the first nine months of 2018 compared to the same period last year.\n\nThe government couldn\u2019t give a reason for the rise, but Jewish leaders lamented the explosion of hate speech online and beyond.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this feeling that something has opened up, a gateway to intolerance and hate,\u201d said rabbi and researcher Delphine Horvilleur. \u201cWords kill. It starts with words and very quickly they turn into acts,\u201d she said, noting the recent deadly attack on the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh.\n\nDespite years of French government efforts to fight it, \u201cwe are very far from having finished with anti-Semitism,\u201d the prime minister wrote. He expressed particular concern because overall, anti-Semitic acts had been on the decline in recent years.\n\nThe government won\u2019t release specific figures until the end of the year. Over all of 2017, the government reported 311 anti-Semitic acts, from threats to swastikas on Jewish gravesites to physical attacks on people wearing kippas. That was down from 335 the year before, but the number of violent anti-Semitic acts rose, along with anti-Muslim and other violent hate crimes.\n\nThe Interior Ministry said part of the recent rise could be attributed to a government push over the past year to encourage people to report hate crimes, including a new online portal to file police reports.\n\nThe prime minister promised new measures to better handle victims and punish perpetrators, to take down potentially violent hate speech online more quickly and to help teachers who report anti-Semitic behavior.\n\n\u201cEach attack against one of our compatriots because he or she is Jewish resonates like new broken glass,\u201d the prime minister said, in reference to the mass crackdown on Jews throughout Germany and Austria on Nov. 9, 1938 known as the Night of Broken Glass, or Kristallnacht. \u201cIt is up to each French person to mobilize \u2018for\u2019 something: for life together, for France\u2019s identity, for the values of the Republic.\u201d\n\nIslamic extremists targeted a Jewish school and kosher supermarket in two of France\u2019s most deadly terrorist attacks in recent years, and some blame Islamic radicalism for resurgent anti-Semitism in France. Muslim leaders acknowledge that some imams have fueled radicalism, but warn against stigmatizing France\u2019s millions of moderate Muslims.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that when the Jews are targeted it means something is wrong within society,\u201d said Horvilleur, the rabbi. \u201cWe have to fight together.

The head of Germany\u2019s Central Council of Jews, Josef Schuster, said the building was set alight in 1938 and the blaze extinguished relatively quickly only so as not to endanger neighboring houses.\n\nSchuster said that, while the Nazis\u2019 SA and SS organizations were responsible for the pogrom, that already meant thousands of Germans took part \u2014 and the population\u2019s reaction \u201cgave the Nazis valuable information: barely anyone protested.\u201d\n\nHe added that, while modern-day attacks on Jews, migrants and Muslims can\u2019t be equated with the crimes of the Nazi era, \u201cI see it as a disgrace for our country that such things happen in Germany in 2018.\u201d\n\nHe assailed the far-right Alternative for Germany party, which he said has \u201crespect for nothing\u201d and which his organization didn\u2019t invite to Friday\u2019s event. The party entered Germany\u2019s parliament last year.\n\n\u201cToday, we are living once again in a time of far-reaching change,\u201d Merkel said. \u201cIn such times, there is always a particularly great danger of those who react with supposedly simple answers gaining support.\u201d\n\nThose answers, she said, are too often accompanied by a \u201cbrutalization of language.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are commemorating today with the promise that we will set ourselves strongly against attacks on our open and plural society,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are commemorating in the knowledge that watching as lines are crossed and crimes are committed ultimately means going along with them.\u201d\n\nIn a separate speech to parliament on a day that also marked the 100th anniversary of the proclamation of a German republic after World War I and the 29th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, President Frank-Walter Steinmeier urged his compatriots to embrace an enlightened, \u201cdemocratic patriotism\u201d and reject aggressive nationalism that romanticizes the country\u2019s history.\n\nEvidence from post-war trials of perpetrators, such as one involving the Bavarian town of Treuchtlingen, shows that many ordinary Germans joined in the 1938 pogrom, some out of anti-Semitism, others using the riots as opportunities to settle personal grudges or to enrich themselves.\n\nThe Treuchtlingen case was one of the first and among the largest of more than 1,000 post-war Kristallnacht trials in West German courts. A report by the U.S. military\u2019s Counter Intelligence Corps, which sent an observer to the 1946 proceedings, provides details about the nearly 60 defendants.\n\nThe report from CIC special agent Erich Bendfeldt was declassified this year by the U.S. National Archives in response to an Associated Press Freedom of Information Act request.\n\nIt shows that the Treuchtlingen synagogue was burned that night to the foundation walls. The fire department hosed down neighboring \u201cAryan-owned\u201d buildings to protect them, while people rampaged through the town, mobbing Jewish homes, destroying property and looting.\n\nOne middle-aged woman swung by the home of a Jewish family she owed money to and destroyed the ledgers, and also had enough time to bring gasoline to help torch the synagogue.\n\nThe town\u2019s mayor took personal command of much of the destruction, while himself beating a respected Jewish doctor nearly to death. A 29-year-old engine driver also beat the doctor, poured a chamber pot over the head of a Jewish girl and forced her father at dagger-point to say \u201cHeil Hitler.\u201d\n\n___\n\nHerschaft contributed reporting from New York.

(AP Photo/Jim Lytle)\n\nTUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) \u2014 No. 1 Alabama just dispatched its biggest division challenger, and now faces its closest rival.\n\nGeographically, at least.\n\nThe Crimson Tide (9-0, 6-0 Southeastern Conference, No. 1 CFP) hosts No. 18 Mississippi State (6-3, 2-3) Saturday trying to extend a 10-game winning streak over the West Division rival from about 90 minutes down the road.\n\nAlabama is a 24-1/2-point favorite after a 29-0 win over No. 9 LSU in what was presumed to be the biggest regular season test. That win secured a spot against No. 5 Georgia in the SEC championship game on Dec. 1.\n\nTide players are still finding ways to motivate themselves even if the team\u2019s doubters aren\u2019t exactly numerous.\n\n\u201cThey said we haven\u2019t played anybody and that our offense and defense were very suspect,\u201d tight end Irv Smith Jr. said. \u201cWe wanted to go out there and show everybody what we were capable of doing.\u201d\n\nSmith\u2019s conclusion after the Baton Rouge beatdown: \u201cOffensively and defensively I feel like nobody can stop us in the country.\u201d\n\nBut the Bulldogs, led by quarterback Nick Fitzgerald, are game to try. The SEC\u2019s top-rated overall, scoring and pass defense gets a shot at what nobody else has been able to do: Contain Alabama\u2019s Heisman Trophy candidate quarterback Tua Tagovailoa.\n\nMississippi State has allowed only nine touchdowns , fewest in the nation, and ranks second allowing just 12.3 points per game.\n\nThe Bulldogs offense, though, has only topped 10 points twice in that decade-long losing streak to the Tide, including last year\u2019s 31-24 defeat.\n\n\u201cWe talk all the time here in our building and with our kids about the term \u2018Championship Standard\u2019 and, quite frankly, this is what we are chasing,\u201d said Bulldogs coach Joe Moorhead, facing the Tide for the first time.\n\n\u201cAlabama is the gold standard in this league. I told the team (Sunday) night, no one falls to the top of the mountain. These guys have worked their tails off and earned the right to be there. It is our job to go out there and try to knock them off.\u201d\n\nHere are some other things to watch in the Mississippi State-Alabama game:\n\nHOME STREAK\n\nThe Tide has won 23 consecutive games at home and could match the school record set from 1971-74 at Legion Field and Bryant-Denny.\n\nMISSISSIPPI STATE VS NO. 1:\n\nThe Bulldogs have played the No. 1 team in the country eight times, and seven of those games have been against the Tide. The other was against Florida in 2009. Mississippi State\u2019s lone win against the top team came on Nov. 1, 1980, when the Bulldogs beat Alabama 6-3 in Jackson. The closest Mississippi State has come to knocking off No. 1 since that game was last season, when Alabama edged the Bulldogs 31-24 in Starkville.\n\nBALL SECURITY:\n\nMississippi State is the only team in the Football Bowl Subdivision that hasn\u2019t lost a fumble this year. It\u2019s a streak that includes 344 rushing attempts. Fitzgerald has lost a fumble only three times in his career and all three came in 2016. Since then, he\u2019s had 458 carries without a lost fumble.\n\nTAGOVAILOA VS. FITZGERALD\n\nThey\u2019re two very different quarterbacks but both are dangerous. Tagovailoa is one of the nation\u2019s top passers with 27 touchdowns and just one interception (coming against LSU). He did run for a 44-yard touchdown in that game despite a gimpy right knee, but mainly makes plays with his left arm.\n\nFitzgerald is the SEC\u2019s all-time career leader in yards rushing for a quarterback and ranks second in the league overall with 104.9 yards per game.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got a great arm and he\u2019s a very effective passer when he needs to be,\u201d Alabama coach Nick Saban said. \u201cThis guy\u2019s got to be one of the best dual-threat quarterbacks in the country.\u201d\n\nDEFENSIVE LINE STARS\n\nThis game will feature some of the SEC\u2019s top defensive linemen, from Alabama\u2019s Quinnen Williams, Raekwon Davis and Isaiah Buggs to Mississippi State\u2019s Montez Sweat and Jeffery Simmons.\n\nSweat is second in the league with 9.5 sacks and Buggs is right behind at 9.0. Williams has emerged as one of the Tide\u2019s biggest stars in his first season as a starter.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer David Brandt in Starkville, Mississippi, contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "", "OLIVE BRANCH, Miss.

The Associated Press purchased an early copy. \u201cWe had one pregnancy test come back positive, which caused us both to forget every worry and swoon with joy, but a couple of weeks later I had a miscarriage, which left me physically uncomfortable and cratered any optimism we felt.\u201d\n\nThe Obamas opted for IVF, one form of assisted reproduction that typically involves removing eggs from a woman, fertilizing them with sperm in a lab, and implanting the resulting embryo. It costs thousands of dollars for every \u201ccycle,\u201d and many couples require more than one attempt.\n\nMrs. Obama writes of being alone to administer herself shots to help hasten the process.

She remembered being labeled \u201cangry\u201d and, by the Fox network, \u201cObama\u2019s Baby Mama.\u201d\n\nIn the White House, she knew she would be labeled \u201cother\u201d and would have to earn the aura of \u201cgrace\u201d given freely to her white predecessors. She found confidence in repeating to herself a favorite chant: \u201cAm I good enough? Yes I am.\u201d\n\nIn the memoir, Mrs. Obama lets loose a blast of anger at Trump.\n\nShe writes that Trump\u2019s questioning of whether her husband was an American citizen was \u201ccrazy and mean-spirited\u201d \u2014 and \u201cdangerous.\u201d Trump suggested Obama was not born in the U.S. but on foreign soil \u2014 his father was Kenyan. The former president was born in Hawaii.\n\n\u201cWhat if someone with an unstable mind loaded a gun and drove to Washington? What if that person went looking for our girls?\u201d she writes in the memoir. \u201cDonald Trump, with his loud and reckless innuendos, was putting my family\u2019s safety at risk. And for this, I\u2019d never forgive him.\u201d\n\nAs he left for Paris Friday, Trump chose not to respond to the former first lady, telling reporters, \u201cOh, I guess she wrote a book.
