Buses carrying students to school at that hour were diverted and parents were notified of the situation by tweet.\n\nThe campus was sealed and nearby police officers responded, The Associated Press reported. It seemed as if our turn had finally come.\n\nThankfully, there was no shooter and no weapon. A faulty water heater had produced sounds that resembled gunfire.\n\nThat was a relief. And a grim reminder that this could happen anywhere.\n\nBut who could be blamed for expecting the worst? The scenario had been all too real late Wednesday night in Thousand Oaks, Calif. Only two weeks after a man entered a Pittsburgh synagogue and fatally shot 11 people, a gunman entered a country music bar and killed 12 people, including a veteran sheriff\u2019s deputy who had rushed in to confront him.\n\nThe shooter, who was cold-blooded and methodical, also injured 18 before reportedly killing himself. He was identified as a 28-year-old Afghanistan war veteran, and he used a handgun equipped with an illegal, extra-capacity magazine. Several who were in the bar that night had seen this kind of horror before. They attended the 2017 country music festival in Las Vegas where a gunman killed 58 people from a perch in a hotel room. It was just one more devastating mass shooting to add to the rest.\n\nAs they keep happening, we look to our legislators, who express their condolences. And then we wait for the next one, very possibly here.\n\n...\n\nOnline: https://www.greensboro.com/\n\n___\n\nNov. 10\n\nStarNews of Wilmington on some of the choices made by voters:\n\nVoters handed the leadership faction in North Carolina\u2019s General Assembly a couple of black eyes this month.\n\nFirst, two proposed constitutional amendments \u2014 which would have turned court appointments and the elections board, essentially, over to whoever\u2019s running the legislature \u2014 were both shot down by large margins. Good. This was a pretty naked power grab, which had nothing to do with good government or political principle.\n\nSecond, barring changes in the election canvasses, it looks as if Republicans lost their veto-proof majorities in Raleigh. Good again: The leadership faction pushed through a lot of junk with barely any debate. Bills read as if they were dashed off in a back room in a matter of minutes.\n\nThis is not a matter of ideology; it\u2019s sloppy governance. The leadership left North Carolina saddled with bad bills, like the poorly considered HB-2, which cost the state billions, all for a matter of symbolism. (We never could figure out how it was supposed to be enforced, barring posting guards at bathrooms to perform pat-downs.) HB-2, remember, was dashed off in a single-day special session, then bulldozed into law, only to eventually be scrapped.\n\nNow Republicans in the legislature will have to come up with budgets and laws that Gov. Cooper, a Democrat, will be willing to live with. (One reason governors are an essential part of the overall political system is the simple fact that their elections cannot be gerrymandered). That means they will have to talk to their Democratic colleagues, negotiate and come up with compromises. Nobody will get everything they want, but if the negotiating goes well, most people will get something, and no one can be really mad.\n\n...\n\nDemocrats and Republicans, liberals, conservatives and moderates are not inherently evil, worthy of destruction. They\u2019re American citizens with different ideas.\n\nSome of those ideas are better than others, but no side, to be honest, has a monopoly on truth or wisdom. Those ideas should be argued out, openly and with plenty of time for discussion. It takes awhile and can be messy, but generally, the best ideas get adopted while others fade away.\n\nNorth Carolina voters, in their wisdom, seem to have brought a welcome dose of democracy back to Raleigh.\n\nOnline: https://www.starnewsonline.com/\n\n___\n\nNov. 13\n\nThe Fayetteville Observer on a lawsuit against GOP mapmakers alleging illegal partisan gerrymandering:\n\nWell of course it\u2019s blatant and outrageous gerrymandering, with state and federal legislative districts deliberately drawn to give one party overwhelming advantage over the other. Nobody has offered an honest argument to the contrary.\n\nRather, the Dark Lord of Gerrymander \u2014 more widely known as Republican Rep. David Lewis of Harnett County, the chief legislative architect of those districts \u2014 freely admits to the mischief, saying he set out to draw as many districts as possible that give advantage to his party, and that he\u2019d have drawn more of them if it was technically possible. Political analysts across the country routinely name North Carolina as the state that somehow gets away with the most extreme gerrymandering in the nation.\n\nAnd the courts have agreed. North Carolina\u2019s politically extreme redistricting was so blatantly unfair that it convinced many federal judges, for the first time in our nation\u2019s history, that political gerrymandering should be banned, or at least substantially tamed. Only the U.S. Supreme Court has yet to make it official. It thought about buying into the trend in its last session, but then chickened out, sending a North Carolina challenge and several others back to lower courts on technicalities.\n\nSadly, we were also found to be a national leader in racial gerrymandering, and on that count, the Supreme Court had no hesitancy in ruling against us.\n\nAnd now comes a renewed front in the war on gerrymandering, led by the political reform group Common Cause and the state Democratic Party. They and some Democratic and unaffiliated voters filed suit Tuesday against the Republican mapmakers in a Wake County court, where it will be heard by a three-judge panel. The suit argues that, \u201cElections to the North Carolina General Assembly are not \u2018free\u2019 when the outcomes are predetermined by partisan actors sitting behind a computer.\u201d Any verdict is expected to be appealed to the state Supreme Court.\n\nThe latest push against gerrymandering comes as we move closer to the 2020 federal census and the national presidential election in the same year. The outcome of the census will lead to yet another redrawing of state and congressional legislative districts and the suit\u2019s proponents are hoping to end political gerrymandering by then. \u201cBecause lawmakers stubbornly refuse to consider passing redistricting reform, we\u2019re left with no choice but to litigate,\u201d Common Cause NC Executive Director Bob Phillips said in an announcement of the suit. \u201cGerrymandering is detrimental to democracy, denying voters a choice and a voice on Election Day.\u201d\n\nState GOP Executive Director Dallas Woodhouse couldn\u2019t resist the small irony and tweaked the Democrats: \u201cOnly North Carolina Democrats would file a lawsuit to overturn districts that they just won.\u201d Democrats did make a good showing on Election Day, taking enough additional seats in the state House and Senate to end the Republicans\u2019 veto-proof majority and force the two parties to negotiate on major legislation and overrides of Gov. Roy Cooper\u2019s vetoes. But the truth is that the party would have done even better if it was campaigning in districts that were politics-neutral, drawn to give fair and equitable representation to all voters.\n\nThis latest set of legislative maps was drawn in 2017. Republican-drawn maps have been under almost constant legal challenge since they were drawn early in this decade. The suits charging racial gerrymandering were upheld and resulted in the redrawing of numerous districts. The party that wins the 2020 legislative races will get to draw the next set of maps. Filing for those elections begins in just over a year.\n\nWhat we and many others interested in fair elections want to see is an end to partisan gerrymandering before that election, and before the 2020 census. We don\u2019t want Democrats drawing our electoral districts any more than we want Republicans to do it. An independent commission should be doing that work, free from political influence from any direction. We hope this new suit is one more step toward that goal.\n\nOnline: https://www.fayobserver.com/", "ORLANDO, Fla.

On Wednesday, Democratic Sen. Andy Billig, the chamber\u2019s new majority leader and a member of the committee who was among the votes last week in favor of the investigation, said the process will continue.\n\n\u201cThis is important for this situation and to affirm for all survivors that if they come forward, that their claims will be taken seriously,\u201d Billig said.\n\nSecretary of the Senate Brad Hendrickson said that he\u2019s currently researching candidates for the job, and hopes to have a recommendation for Senate leadership next week.

Faber, who previously worked with the city of Seattle\u2019s information technology department and as a foreign service officer, said she was inspired to publicly speak out as she watched the televised allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nFaber, 35, said that she was glad the Senate was following through with the investigation because \u201cpublic officials need to be held to a higher standard.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think if it\u2019s done well, and allows truth to come to the surface more fully, that will be some kind of closure,\u201d she said.\n\nFain, 37, was first elected to the Washington state Senate in 2010, three years after the alleged incident. He is currently the state Senate minority floor leader, though his term ends just before the start of the next legislative session on Jan. 14.\n\nFain did not respond to a message Wednesday seeking comment, but issued a statement last week in which he said \u201cI have repeatedly sought a fair and respectful process that will allow me to clear my name and move on.\u201d\n\nThe Legislature has grappled with how to address sexual harassment issues over the past year in light of the #MeToo movement and allegations past and present were brought to light.\n\nThis past summer, the Senate Facilities and Operations Committee approved a recommendation to hire a nonpartisan human resources officer who can independently investigate complaints of harassment or discrimination in the chamber, though any disciplinary actions would still fall to Senate administrators. The decision was one of the recommendations of a bipartisan Senate task force, and the committee has a meeting scheduled for Thursday to discuss a hiring recommendation.\n\nThe House has created its own sexual harassment work group that includes staff, lobbyists and lawmakers, though that group\u2019s recommendations aren\u2019t expected until the end of the year.", "U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis, left, Marine Corps Lt.

But Filipinos revere the bells as symbols of national pride.\n\nU.S. Army soldiers took the bells after an attack killed 48 American troops in 1901, during the U.S. occupation of the Philippines.

I\u2019m not feeling that.\u2019\u201d\n\nMariota said previously he might not have known how a play would look or work on the field.\n\n\u201cHaving confidence in it, being in the offense a little longer has definitely helped that,\u201d Mariota said.\n\nThe results might not show up in NFL rankings with the Titans (5-4) 30th in total offense and 18th averaging 18.7 points a game.\n\nThe offensive turnaround started Oct. 21 in London in a 20-19 loss to the Chargers and includes a 28-14 win in Dallas and last weekend\u2019s 34-10 rout of the Patriots. In those three games, the Titans have converted 61 percent (25 of 41) of their third downs, which is best in the NFL in that span.\n\nMariota has posted his best passer ratings of the season in each of the past two games, and he has 542 total yards passing, running and catching with five touchdowns. His lone interception in the three-game stretch came in the second quarter against the Chargers\n\nCorey Davis finished with seven catches for 125 yards against Dallas, his second 100-yard receiving game this season. Tight end Jonnu Smith had a career-high 45 yards receiving on three catches with a TD. Even rookie Cameron Batson, who spent three weeks on the practice squad earlier this season, has had four catches for 47 yards over the past two games.\n\nRunning back Dion Lewis believes everyone has gotten comfortable with each other.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of bumps in the road when you\u2019re learning,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cYou make a mistake, and you try not to make the same mistake again. I think that\u2019s what everybody\u2019s trying to do knowing what the coaches expect from them. And if they messed up something in the past, just move on forward and not make that same mistake. I think if guys do that, we can keep building on that as an offense and keep getting better.\u201d\n\nThe results are easy to see with the Titans, who went through an eight-quarter drought without scoring a touchdown during a three-game skid in October. They followed up a season-high 28 points in Dallas with the best first quarter (17) and first half (24) of scoring since Nov. 13, 2016, against Green Bay.\n\nThe Titans are 13th in the NFL holding the ball 30 minutes, 30 seconds per game. They\u2019re also 10th converting third downs, and they\u2019ll test their comfort level Sunday when they visit the Colts (4-5) in a key AFC South game.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done a good job on third downs, definitely done a whole lot better in the red zone being able to score touchdowns,\u201d Mariota said. \u201cIf we can continue that, I think we got a chance to be pretty good.\u201d\n\nNotes: LB Wesley Woodyard was named the AFC defensive player of the week after 1 \u00bd sacks against the Patriots. ...

(AP Photo/Matt Slocum, File)\n\nFRISCO, Texas (AP) \u2014 Ezekiel Elliott paused and lowered his voice when asked what he was doing when the Dallas Cowboys played without their star running back for the first time during his six-game suspension last year.\n\nNot only was Elliott having a self-described \u201ctough time\u201d with the NFL\u2019s ban over domestic violence allegations finally in place after weeks of court battles, but he had to watch a dreadful offensive showing by the Cowboys in a blowout loss to Atlanta. The 27-7 defeat started a three-game losing streak that wiped out any realistic playoff hopes.\n\n\u201cI was home watching it,\u201d Elliott said Wednesday. \u201cTough to watch. Tough time for me. I\u2019m glad I\u2019m out there this year and able to help my guys go out there and try to get this win.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s relevant because the Cowboys (4-5) are visiting the Falcons (4-5) again Sunday, nearly in the same spot on the schedule, in more dire need of a win because of an uneven first-half performance, particularly by the offense.\n\nJust like last year, though \u2014 when Elliott refused upon his return to the team to discuss already-public details about his time away \u2014 Elliott didn\u2019t last long talking about the drama surrounding his suspension, and the impact it had on the Cowboys.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s all behind me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to even need extra motivation when you\u2019re 4-5. For the rest of this season, our backs are up against the wall. We have to do the best we can to go out there and try to win every one of these last games. And those guys on their side, they\u2019re feeling the same way.\u201d\n\nThe next two questions were brushed aside. \u201cI really don\u2019t want to dwell on last year,\u201d Elliott said.\n\nFour-time Pro Bowl right guard Zack Martin didn\u2019t even remember last year\u2019s Atlanta game was the first without Elliott.\n\n\u201cI know you guys want to talk about it,\u201d Martin said. \u201cThat really hasn\u2019t come up at all this year.\u201d\n\nElliott and the Dallas offense have had a rough season, even with a running game that has ranked in the top five most of the season.\n\nBut the 2016 NFL rushing champion as a rookie is coming off one of his best games of the year in a season-saving 27-20 win at defending champion Philadelphia. Elliott had 151 yards rushing with a touchdown and 36 yards receiving with another score \u2014 and a TD he lost by stumbling in the open field after almost cleanly hurdling a defender and landing in stride.\n\n\u201cYou do have a little bit more momentum,\u201d Elliott said. \u201cWhen you have a game like that last week, this Falcons team is going to be that much more clued into the run. It\u2019s not going to be easy.\u201d\n\nThe Cowboys recovered from the downer of losing Elliott to win the last three without him last season. Then they compounded the disappointment by losing his first game back to Seattle when Dallas still had faint playoff hopes.\n\nThat defeat eliminated the Cowboys a year after an NFC-best 13 wins during the remarkable debut seasons for Elliott and quarterback Dak Prescott, the NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year.\n\nFast-forward a year, and Elliott is still second in the league with 831 yards rushing despite an offense ranked 27th overall, and a group of blockers that has struggled since losing four-time Pro Bowl center Travis Frederick to a nerve disorder before the season started. Frederick\u2019s return this season looks less likely each week.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s handled it all really, really well,\u201d coach Jason Garrett said of Elliott . \u201cHe wants to be a great player, wants to have a big impact on our team. I thought he handled a lot of the distractions last year very well. He came back from them and now he\u2019s focused on those same things that we always thought he was all about.\u201d\n\nAnd happy to be playing the Falcons instead of watching from home.\n\nNOTES: LT Tyron Smith was added to the injury report with a back issue Wednesday.

One week after signing, then losing receiver Dez Bryant to an injury, the Saints welcomed another aging star, Brandon Marshall, to their receiver corps. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File)\n\nMETAIRIE, La. (AP) \u2014 Brandon Marshall takes nothing for granted when discussing his opportunity to join the Saints\u2019 seemingly inevitable march to the postseason.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s not jump ahead. I\u2019ve got a lot of learning to do and a lot of catching up,\u201d Marshall said after his first practice with New Orleans on Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019ve been at the top and I\u2019m on the bottom right now.\u201d\n\nBy bottom, the 34-year-old Marshall means getting cut repeatedly in the past couple seasons, most recently by Seattle a couple weeks ago.\n\nEven after he worked out for New Orleans (8-1) last week, Marshall wasn\u2019t the Saints\u2019 top choice. New Orleans went instead with Dez Bryant, but lost the former Dallas Cowboys star to a season-ending Achilles injury in his second practice.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re on the other side of 30 and you don\u2019t produce, this is the situation you\u2019ll find yourself in,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cBeing cut two times in a year is interesting. It built a lot of character. ... When Seattle cut me, I just continued to work out, stay in shape and have faith.\u201d\n\nMarshall had flown back to his temporary home in Seattle after his Saints tryout, only to hop back on a flight to New Orleans again on Sunday afternoon, while the offense he was about to join was putting up 51 points in Cincinnati.\n\nAnkle and toe injuries cost Marshall most of his 2017 season with the New York Giants, who didn\u2019t bring him back, leaving him free to sign with the Seahawks. Marshall said he wasn\u2019t full healthy until around Week 3 or 4 of this season which, ironically, was about the time his snap count began to plummet in Seattle.\n\n\u201cI know that the narrative is that I\u2019m done,\u201d Marshall said.\n\nYet Marshall predicted he\u2019d demonstrate in practice that between his 6-foot-5 frame, route-running, strong hands, and ability to quickly grasp offensive schemes, that he can still help a team with playoff credentials. Marshall noted that because he played in Chicago under then-offensive coordinator Aaron Kromer, a former offensive assistant to Saints coach Sean Payton, he is familiar with New Orleans\u2019 scheme.\n\nPayton called Marshall\u2019s ability to process a play book \u201cone of his strengths,\u201d adding that he expects Marshall\u2019s transition in New Orleans \u201cto be pretty smooth.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Marshall described the opportunity to play with Saints record-setting QB Drew Brees \u201ca wide receiver\u2019s dream.\u201d Likewise, Brees was quick to throw a few compliments Marshall\u2019s way.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a smart, veteran guy who is very fluid. I\u2019ve seen him in a lot of different offenses \u2014 seen him be successful both as an outside receiver, an inside receiver. He\u2019s very versatile. He\u2019s a big target. A big catching radius. Just watching him run today, he\u2019s pretty impressive.\n\n\u201cWe talked for a while today,\u201d Brees added. \u201cHe\u2019s excited. We\u2019re excited to have him.\u201d\n\nMarshall\u2019s addition adds depth to an offense that already leads the NFL in scoring with 36.7 points per game and ranks in the top five in yards per game with 413.9.\n\nSeattle released Marshall on Oct. 30 after he\u2019d appeared in the first seven games this season, catching 11 passes for 136 yards and one touchdown. But he had just two catches for 16 yards in his last four games.\n\nSeattle was the sixth NFL team for Marshall, who has eight 1,000-plus-yard seasons in his career. His best season, statistically, came with the New York Jets in 2015, when he caught 109 passes for 1,502 yards and 14 touchdowns.\n\nEven now, Marshall insisted, his motivation remains to achieve \u201cgreatness.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no reason why, with technology and modern medicine and with access we have to doctors around the world, why athletes can\u2019t play into their mid-30s or their 40s,\u201d Marshall said, stressing that he now feels \u201cfit as a fiddle and healthy as a trout.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not yet clear whether Marshall will play much, if at all this Sunday against Philadelphia. But Eagles coach Doug Pederson said his defense has to be prepared for the possibility.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s, I think, a red-zone threat with his size and so I think that\u2019s where we\u2019ll see him a little bit, is down there,\u201d Pederson said. \u201cHe\u2019s another big, physical receiver, hard to defend and our guys definitely have their work cut out this week.\u201d\n\nNotes: Starting left tackle Terron Armstead did not practice.

I love the tradition, the history,\u201d Keenum told The Associated Press on his way to the weight room after practice Wednesday.\n\nAs if on cue, Keenum triggered an automatic door leading from the facility to the parking lot that separates the weight room from the rest of the team\u2019s headquarters.\n\nHe pointed to the larger-than-life photos of Broncos greats that decorate the walls and halls of the UC Health Center.\n\n\u201cI mean, you walk in and the pictures are right there of who\u2019s played here and what they\u2019ve done,\u201d Keenum said. \u201cSo, I don\u2019t take it lightly. I love my job. I love what I do. Personally, I feel like I\u2019ve got the best job in the world.\u201d\n\nEven though it comes with such little patience from the boo-birds at the stadium and the longtime listeners/first-time callers smarting over the Broncos\u2019 3-6 start, Keenum\u2019s 10 interceptions and two dozen sacks in his Denver debut.\n\nKeenum knew Denver was different from his other NFL stops when he signed with the Broncos for two years and $36 million after leading the Vikings to the NFC championship game.\n\n\u201cI love it. And I understand that there\u2019s pressure and expectations that come with it,\u201d Keenum said. \u201cI\u2019ve had those pressures and those expectations on myself my whole career, my whole life. Every time I step on the field I want to win. I expect to win and I expect to do well.\n\n\u201cSo, that\u2019s me, that\u2019s who I am and I think that\u2019s why I\u2019m built to play quarterback here.\u201d\n\nHis new workplace, where three Lombardi Trophies loom large in the lobby, isn\u2019t anything like Keenum\u2019s stops in Houston, where he also played college ball; St. Louis, where they were about to lose a franchise; L.A., where those Rams weren\u2019t yet these Rams; and Minnesota, where he subbed for Sam Bradford.\n\nHere, the fans let their beloved Broncos hear about it the first time a pass is off target.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just the fan base here, they expect good things, they expect explosive plays, they expect offense,\u201d Keenum said. \u201cAnd I love that they care, I really do. I\u2019d rather them be that way than nobody shows up. I\u2019d rather play in front of all those fans that are into the game than just some other fans \u2014 not to mention any other fans out there \u2014 that come for the tailgate and the party. They want football and I appreciate that.\u201d\n\nBut for three plays, the Broncos could be 6-3 instead of 3-6 heading into their game against the Chargers (7-2) this weekend.\n\n\u2014 Keenum missed a wide-open Demaryius Thomas for the game-winning TD in the final minute of a 27-23 loss to Kansas City that helped grow the legend of Patrick Mahomes.\n\n\u2014 Emmanuel Sanders\u2019 taunting flag after an apparent touchdown cost Denver four points in a 23-20 loss to the Rams.\n\n\u2014 Brandon McManus pushed a 51-yard field goal wide right as time expired in a 19-17 loss to the Texans.\n\nWith the Broncos flirting with back-to-back losing seasons for the first time since 1971-72, fans are left wondering whether Keenum is the answer at quarterback or if there was anything to general manager John Elway going to watch Oregon QB Justin Herbert last month.\n\nThey\u2019ve seen a succession of quarterbacks flame out in Denver following Manning\u2019s retirement a month after the Broncos\u2019 Super Bowl parade 33 months ago:\n\n\u2014 Mark Sanchez was cut in camp.\n\n\u2014 Trevor Siemian kept getting hurt and eventually was traded.\n\n\u2014 Brock Osweiler was brought back in 2017 but not re-signed in 2018.\n\n\u2014 Paxton Lynch, a first-round bust.\n\n\u2014 Chad Kelly, a backup who got arrested.\n\nIf the Broncos had beaten the Chiefs (9-1), Rams (9-1) and Texans (6-3), maybe the buzz is all about a long-term extension for Keenum instead of whether he\u2019s the right quarterback to lead the Broncos\u2019 revival.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not in my mind,\u201d Keenum said. \u201cDuring the season I\u2019m taking it one game at a time.

I know this is different personnel on their side of the ball than we\u2019ve seen over the years, but they\u2019re still playing really well.\u201d\n\nRodgers and Wilson are being helped this year by improved run games that are among the best in the league. Green Bay\u2019s Aaron Jones leads the NFL in yards per carry, while Seattle has the No. 1 rushing offense and last week rushed for 273 yards against the Rams without starting running back Chris Carson.\n\nHere\u2019s what else to watch for on Thursday night:\n\nFIRST UP\n\nSeattle expects Carson to be available after missing last Sunday\u2019s game with a hip injury. If Carson can go, he will be the starter. But Seattle finally saw the promise of rookie first-round pick Rashaad Penny last week when he rushed for 108 yards on 12 carries and a touchdown. Penny showed the burst and big-play ability that had been missing through the first half of the season.\n\nExpect Penny to get additional chances no matter Carson\u2019s health as the Seahawks look to use its three-back trio \u2014 Carson, Penny, Mike Davis \u2014 all of whom have 100-yard rushing games this season.\n\nSECONDARY MATTERS\n\nAnother week, another lineup shuffle likely in the Green Bay secondary. Kentrell Brice was walking in the locker room with a boot on his left foot early in the week, making it appear unlikely that he will be ready to go on a short turnaround.\n\nThe Packers traded Ha Ha Clinton-Dix to Washington two weeks ago. Jermaine Whitehead was released last week. No Brice would mean probably mean veteran Tramon Williams and second-year player Josh Jones starting at safety. Kevin King (hamstring) also appears likely to miss another game, while fellow cornerback Bashaud Breeland (groin) was limited during the week.\n\nHERE\u2019S JIMMY\n\nTight end Jimmy Graham is returning to Seattle for the first time since signing with the Packers as a free agent in the offseason. With just two touchdowns so far this year, Graham perhaps hasn\u2019t had quite the impact in the end zone as in 2017, when he had 10 scores with Seattle.\n\nBut with 33 catches through nine games, Graham in on pace to match the production he had with the Seahawks. He\u2019s also taking pride in his run-blocking, and his part in helping Aaron Jones run for career highs of 145 yards and two scores last week.\n\n\u201cI know everybody knows me for running go routes and snagging touchdowns, but I think I\u2019ve dedicated myself to the run, to being a part of that because I\u2019m a tight end now,\u201d Graham said on Sunday. \u201cFor us to be successful I\u2019ve got to do those things and I\u2019ve got to be good at them.\u201d\n\nQUICK TURNAROUND\n\nBecause of the quick turnaround from last Sunday several players have been ruled out. Along with Brice and King, the Packers have also ruled out wide receiver Randall Cobb and linebacker Nick Perry.\n\nSeattle linebacker K.J. Wright was listed as doubtful because of a knee injury that knocked him out of last Sunday\u2019s game early. Carroll said Wright would be a game-time decision. Seattle sat Carson and guard D.J. Fluker against the Rams and both appear set to play against the Packers.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "Recent editorials from Alabama newspapers:\n\n___\n\nNov. 10\n\nDothan Eagle on straight party voting:\n\nThe Alabama Secretary of State\u2019s Office reported a startling statistic late about the balloting in our state on Election Day. About 1.7 million ballots were cast, representing about 50 percent of voting-age Alabamians. Of those, 1.1 million voters voted straight-party.\n\nThat means 2 out of 3 who went to the polls got a ballot and, instead of going race to race to determine which candidate might best serve the people of Alabama, simply marked \u201cAlabama Democratic Party\u201d or \u201cAlabama Republican Party\u201d at the top of the page. More to the point, 660,000 went for the GOP; 450,000 chose the Democratic Party.\n\nWhile that tells us something we already knew \u2014 that there are at least half again as many Republicans as Democrats in our state \u2014 it strongly suggests that the majority of voters are so aligned with their particular party affiliation that they\u2019re not willing to consider a candidate who\u2019s not in their fold.\n\nThat mirrors the polarization in the national arena. However, it raises the question whether straight-party voting is good for the republic.\n\nFor instance, a voter in Houston County who chose a straight party ticket might have realized later that their choice meant they\u2019d voted for someone in a particular race when they supported the other, as a Democrat voter who meant to support GOP Sheriff Donald Valenza might have discovered after the fact.\n\nIn recent years, several states have discontinued straight party balloting. Alabama is among the eight that still use it, although Texas will end the practice in 2020. There is also movement at the federal level to ban the practice.\n\nThat would not mean that a strongly partisan voter could not eschew every candidate who\u2019s not in their favored party. It just means they\u2019ll have to do it race by race. Hopefully, they\u2019ll weigh each candidate on his or her own merits in the process.\n\nOnline: https://www.dothaneagle.com/\n\n___\n\nNov. 11\n\nThe Decatur Daily on former Attorney General Jeff Sessions being pushed out:\n\nJeff Sessions\u2019 tenure as attorney general has been anything but distinguished. In his 21 months on the job, Sessions stood in the way of meaningful criminal justice reform, stoked fears of rising crime in an era of historically low crime, threatened states that seek to apply a bit of federalism to their marijuana laws, and let local law enforcement agencies with histories of excessive force and racial discrimination know they\u2019d have little to fear from his Justice Department.\n\nBut, ironically, Sessions was fired for doing the right thing. And there is no debate about his being fired. This was not a simple resignation. His letter begins, \u201cDear Mr. President, At your request, I am submitting my resignation.\u201d It\u2019s a passive-aggressive jab, far milder than the jabs President Donald Trump has lobbed his way, but it leaves no doubt Sessions did not leave of his own accord; Trump pushed him.\n\nThus ends arguably the most dysfunctional relationship between a president and a member of his administration since Andrew Jackson (Trump\u2019s favorite predecessor) and Vice President John C. Calhoun.\n\nThe tension between Trump and Sessions has been present since almost Day 1 of Sessions taking office, stemming from Sessions recusing himself from overseeing Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Trump\u2019s presidential campaign and what if any illegal ties it might have had to agents of Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s kleptocratic regime.\n\nIt must be stressed that Sessions\u2019 decision to recuse himself was not optional; it was legally required. As a member of Trump\u2019s campaign team, Sessions was involved in or at least close to many of the events under investigation. It would be a blatant conflict of interest to investigate allegations that amount to investigating himself.\n\nThat hasn\u2019t mattered at all to Trump, who seems to have expected Sessions to shield him from investigation and has never forgiven him for leaving the investigation outside Trump\u2019s ability to control it.\n\nSo, Sessions is gone, for doing the right thing, while other members of the Trump administration accused of wrongdoing that once would have resulted in a swift dismissal remain. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, for example, continues to maintain investments he is legally required to divest, and has even increased his portfolio.\n\nMeanwhile, Sessions\u2019 temporary replacement, Matthew Whitaker \u2014 whose appointment as acting attorney general is arguably unconstitutional, especially if one agrees with Justice Clarence Thomas\u2019 rulings in similar cases \u2014 is on the record as a critic of Mueller\u2019s investigation.\n\nThe House, now in Democratic hands, can issue all of the subpoenas it likes, but the Senate confirms presidential appointments, and there the Republican majority has grown. What will the Senate do to see that the rule of law prevails?\n\n\u201cIf Jeff Sessions is fired, there will be holy hell to pay,\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., once said. But that was more than a year ago, when Graham was still playing Igor to the now late Sen. John McCain\u2019s Dr. Frankenstein. Now Graham has a new master, and golfing buddy \u2014 President Trump.\n\n\u201cI look forward to working with President @realDonaldTrump to find a confirmable, worthy successor so that we can start a new chapter at the Department of Justice and deal with both the opportunities and challenges our nation faces,\u201d Graham tweeted the day of Sessions\u2019 firing.\n\nA Senate that has turned a blind eye to date likely will not suddenly see the light now.\n\nOnline: https://www.decaturdaily.com/\n\n___\n\nNov. 13\n\nThe Gadsden Times on an insurer cracking down on OxyContin prescriptions:\n\nBlue Cross Blue Shield of Alabama insures close to 3 million people, roughly two-thirds of them in the state where it\u2019s located.\n\nSo the company\u2019s announcement that effective Jan. 1, it no longer will cover standard formulations of the opioid painkiller OxyContin drew some attention.\n\nOne side probably saw it as an unfortunate but necessary new front in the war against opioid abuse, which has ensnared and killed thousands of Americans.\n\nAnother side probably saw it as a heartless move by a bean-counting insurer that will cause more suffering for people in chronic pain who legitimately need something to help them function in daily life.\n\nLet\u2019s dive into the middle, where the truth normally can be found.\n\nFirst, Blue Cross isn\u2019t completely dropping coverage for OxyContin (or oxycodone, its generic equivalent). It still will cover Xtampza ER, a new formulation of OxyContin that is much more difficult to abuse.\n\nBasic OxyContin, an extended release drug, was reformulated eight years ago with that goal in mind, but users still can crush or liquefy it to facilitate snorting or injecting it. They can\u2019t do that with Xtampza ER, however, or with Roxybond, a non-extended-release variety of OxyContin that Blue Cross also will cover. We don\u2019t think requiring those formulations is an unfair hoop for patients to negotiate.\n\nBlue Cross attempting to crack down on painkillers also didn\u2019t just materialize out of a swamp. Its Florida division instituted a similar ban last year, as did its Tennessee division in September.\n\nEarlier this year in Alabama, it set a one-week limit on initial fills of the painkillers Lortab, Vicodin and Percocet, and started requiring extra authorization for initial prescriptions of OxyContin and other long-acting drugs.\n\nThe company has launched other nationwide initiatives to curb opioid addiction while ensuring that chronic pain patients still receive adequate medication and care.\n\nPeople can ascribe financial motives to those decisions \u2014 drugmakers who are just as focused on the bottom line and fear declining profits certainly are singing that tune. We\u2019ll give Blue Cross the benefit of the doubt that it\u2019s not good P.R. \u2014 certainly not good for business \u2014 to be associated with addiction and death.\n\nBesides, we\u2019re sympathetic to the notion of fewer opioid prescriptions being written, especially in this state and area, even if it helps Blue Cross\u2019 bottom line.\n\nAlabama, as we\u2019ve noted more than once, leads the nation in the per capita rate of painkiller prescriptions. In May, AL.com reported that the Fourth Congressional District \u2014 which includes Etowah County \u2014 has the highest rate of opioid prescriptions of any congressional district in the U.S.\n\nThe number, based on 2016 data, is 166 prescriptions per 100 people. That\u2019s 1.66 prescriptions for every man, woman and child in the district. We don\u2019t presume to tell physicians how to do their jobs, and we\u2019re sympathetic to the real-world needs of chronic pain sufferers, but to our layman\u2019s brain and eyes, that is absurd. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 40 percent of the opioid overdose deaths \u2014 an average of 46 a day \u2014 are from prescribed medications.\n\nWe\u2019re under no illusions that this will be a magic fix to the opioid epidemic. We\u2019re aware that it likely will increase business for pushers. We\u2019re aware that any real progress will take physicians, patients, law enforcement and the legal and mental health systems working together (and changing a few hearts and mind-sets).\n\nHowever, sometimes doing nothing isn\u2019t the best thing. We think that\u2019s the case here with Blue Cross.\n\nOnline: http://www.gadsdentimes.com/", "FILE - In this Sept. 26, 2018, file photo, New York Mets pitcher Jacob deGrom smiles after getting the win as the Mets defeated the Atlanta Braves 3-0 in a baseball game in New York. DeGrom won the National League Cy Young Award on Wednesday, Nov. 14. (AP Photo/Bill Kostroun, File)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 After a season marred by narrow defeats, Jacob deGrom became a runaway winner.\n\nThe New York Mets ace easily won the National League Cy Young Award on Wednesday night, a reward for a historically fruitless season in Flushing. The right-hander had just 10 victories, the fewest ever by a Cy Young-winning starter.\n\nThe AL prize also reflected a change in voters\u2019 values, with Blake Snell of the Tampa Bay Rays narrowly beating out past winners Justin Verlander and Corey Kluber for his first Cy Young. Snell pitched just 180 2/3 innings, fewest ever by a Cy Young-winning starter. Over full seasons, Snell is the second starter to win the award with fewer than 200 innings after Clayton Kershaw logged 198 1/3 in 2014.\n\n\u201cI definitely think the game has changed in that aspect,\u201d deGrom said.\n\n\u201cI feel like it\u2019s just turning more into quality of work and what did you accomplish in those innings,\u201d Snell said. \u201cI think that\u2019s just the way it\u2019s going.\u201d\n\nDeGrom easily beat out Washington\u2019s Max Scherzer, who was seeking a third straight Cy Young and fourth overall. DeGrom got 29 first-place votes and 207 points from members of the Baseball Writers\u2019 Association of America. Scherzer had the other first-place vote.\n\nIn his first season after chopping off his distinctive long hair, deGrom cut down hitters from start to finish despite little help from teammates. He had a 1.70 ERA, the lowest in the NL since Zack Greinke\u2019s 1.66 mark in 2015. Yet the 30-year-old right-hander went 10-9, eclipsing the low bar among starters of 13 victories set by the Dodgers\u2019 Fernando Valenzuela in 1981 and matched by Seattle\u2019s Felix Hernandez in 2010.\n\nDeGrom allowed three runs or fewer in 29 consecutive starts to close the season, breaking Leslie \u201cKing\u201d Cole\u2019s 108-year-old record of 26 such outings. Yet the Mets were 11-18 in those games and 14-18 overall with deGrom on the mound.\n\n\u201cMy thought process was, \u2018Hey, take the ball every fifth day and continue to try to put this team in position to win and control what you can control,\u2019\u201d deGrom said.\n\nHernandez\u2019s Cy Young victory signaled a major shift from voters, who once prioritized pitcher wins. The push toward advanced analytics made deGrom\u2019s candidacy possible, and by September there was little debate deGrom was worthy, even as the Mets regularly wasted his dominance.\n\n\u201cThis was one of my goals,\u201d deGrom said. \u201cThe team didn\u2019t end up where we wanted to be this past season, but you kind of set personal goals, and I think being able to accomplish something that has been a dream of yours is just something special. To be a Cy Young Award winner, you\u2019re in great company, and it truly is an honor.\u201d\n\nPerhaps no pitcher had ever been such a hard-luck loser. New York averaged 3.5 runs in games started by deGrom, second only to Cole Hamels for worst support in the majors among qualified pitchers. During one stretch late in the season, the Mets totaled 10 runs over seven of deGrom\u2019s outings, and four of those were driven in by the pitcher himself.\n\nDeGrom nearly produced more wins above replacement than actual wins \u2014 an unfortunate sabermetric feat that has only been accomplished once, when the Philadelphia Athletics\u2019 Eddie Smith went 4-17 with 4.1 WAR in 1937. Baseball-Reference calculated deGrom for 9.6 WAR.\n\nThe 2014 NL Rookie of the Year, he became the seventh rookie winner voted a Cy Young, joining fellow Mets Tom Seaver and Dwight Gooden. R.A. Dickey was the only other Met to win a Cy Young.\n\nThe Mets unveiled a deGrom bobblehead featuring the Cy Young Award shortly after deGrom was crowned. They will give away 25,000 prior to a home game April 7 against Scherzer\u2019s Nationals.\n\nSnell got 17 first-place votes and 169 points to 13 first-place votes and 154 points for Verlander. Kluber had 71 points, followed by Boston\u2019s Chris Sale and Houston\u2019s Gerrit Cole.\n\nSnell had a 1.89 ERA, third best in the AL since the DH was introduced, trailing only Ron Guidry (1.74) in 1978 and Pedro Martinez (1.74) in 2000. The 25-year-old pitched had 33 1/3 fewer innings than Verlander, but his dominance was enough to sway the electorate.\n\nThe lefty nicknamed Snellzilla wreaked havoc against the AL\u2019s top lineups. He was 3-0 with a 1.08 ERA in four starts against the World Series champion Red Sox, and 2-0 in two starts each against the Astros and Indians. The Yankees roughed Snell up twice, but he got threw five scoreless innings in a victory Aug. 16. That came during a late-season run of nine consecutive wins for Snell, including a victory against every team in the AL East. He also made five starts against former Cy Young winners and went 3-0 with an 0.59 ERA.\n\nSnell was the first player 25-or-younger to win 21 games since Barry Zito in 2002. He was highly regarded as a minor leaguer for his electric arsenal, but subpar control led to struggles during his first two major league seasons. He was even demoted to Triple-A for a month in 2017.\n\nIt all came together this year. Snell was a stalwart for a most unusual pitching staff, taking the ball every fifth day while manager Kevin Cash successfully experimented with reliever \u201copeners\u201d to start games in between. Snell led the Rays with 31 starts, and no other traditional starter had more than 17. After longtime franchise ace Chris Archer was traded to the Pirates on July 31, Snell went 9-0 with a 1.17 ERA.\n\n\u201cI felt with the opener, I had a bigger role on the team,\u201d Snell said.\n\nSnell is the second Rays pitcher to win the award, following David Price in 2012.\n\nScherzer went 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and led the majors with 220 2/3 innings and 300 strikeouts. He was attempting to become the first player since Randy Johnson to win three consecutive Cy Youngs. He got the first-place vote of John Maffei of the San Diego Union-Tribune, 29 seconds and 123 points. Aaron Nola of the Philadelphia Phillies was third with 86 points, followed by Colorado\u2019s Kyle Freeland and Arizona\u2019s Patrick Corbin.\n\nVerlander led the AL with 290 strikeouts while going 16-9 with a 2.52 ERA for AL West champion Houston. This is his third second-place finish since winning the Cy Young and MVP in 2011 with Detroit.\n\nKluber was attempting to win his second straight Cy Young and third overall. He went 20-7 with a 2.89 ERA for AL Central champion Cleveland and led the AL with 215 innings.\n\n___\n\nFollow Jake Seiner: https://twitter.com/Jake_Seiner\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "Michael Avenatti speaks to the media outside the Los Angeles Police Department Pacific Division after being released from police custody following his arrest on a felony domestic violence charge, Wednesday, Nov. 14, 2018, in Los Angeles.

Pictures shows Lady Gaga, left, and Bradley Cooper in a scene from \"A Star is Born.\" (Clay Enos/Warner Bros. Pictures via AP)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 F. Scott Fitzgerald, who said there are no second acts in American lives, might have felt differently had he seen this year\u2019s Oscar race.\n\nIn mid-November, there is much solidifying, scrapping and self-promotion to come (not to mention a few potential awards heavyweights). But most of the expected contenders have by now been seen and there\u2019s a definite theme: Reinvention is the season\u2019s most sought-after attribute.\n\nOne after another, potential contenders have trotted out new iterations of themselves: Lady Gaga, the actor; Alfonso Cuaron, the re-made filmmaker; Melissa McCarthy, dramatic actress; Peter Farrelly, a million miles from \u201cDumb and Dumber.\u201d\n\nMetamorphoses, like that of Rami Malek\u2019s prosthetic-toothed, full-bodied performance as Freddie Mercury in \u201cBohemian Rhapsody\u201d (an expected best actor nominee), are always a staple of awards season. But this year, transformation is more than a costume change. It\u2019s an abiding ethos.\n\nComing between the fall festivals and the onset of critics\u2019 awards, November is when Oscar campaigns hope to get enough traction to land on \u2014 or ascend \u2014 the short lists that proliferate ahead of the litany of ceremonies to come.\n\nFrom Lady Gaga to Peter Farrelly, reinvention is this season's most sought-after attribute in the competition for an Oscar. (Nov. 14)\n\nSo far, much of the field breaks down between an old dichotomy: crowd-pleasers and show-stoppers, and intimate art-house indies. Among the former are Bradley Cooper\u2019s box-office smash \u201cA Star Is Born\u201d; Peter Farrelly\u2019s soon-to-debut charmer \u201cGreen Book,\u201d with Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen; and Ryan Coogler\u2019s superhero sensation \u201cBlack Panther.\u201d\n\nAll of them are studio films. And each reminds Hollywood it can still do something it may have thought it no longer could: make an old-fashioned romance; craft a poignant, uplifting comic drama; create an urgent and meaningful comic book film.\n\nLike many of this year\u2019s nominees, Hollywood, itself, is in flux. The film industry is becoming more digital (Disney and Warner Bros. are prepping Netflix-like streaming services) and it\u2019s shrinking (Disney is acquiring Fox; more consolidation is expected). Hollywood is searching for a second act, too.\n\nThat pressure is due, in part, to new viewing habits and deep-pocketed innovators like Netflix, which this year has its most lauded Oscar contender yet: Cuaron\u2019s \u201cRoma,\u201d a deeply personal black-and-white film that the Mexican director has said made him reinvent himself as a filmmaker. \u201cRoma\u201d won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival, and it\u2019s expected to return Cuaron (who won best director for his last film, 2013\u2032s \u201cGravity\u201d) to the category, alongside Cooper, whose \u201cA Star Is Born\u201d launches the 43-year-old actor as director.\n\nPartly to appease Oscar voters, Netflix has for the first time granted a theatrical window for a handful of films (including \u201cRoma\u201d and the Coen brothers\u2019 \u201cThe Ballad of Buster Scruggs\u201d). The gesture has an underlying message to Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences members: Netflix and theaters can coexist (at least if an Oscar is at stake).\n\nThere are plenty of contenders predicated not on reinvention, but on doing what they do best. There is Spike Lee\u2019s incendiary \u201cBlacKkKlansman,\u201d a prize-winner at the Cannes Film Festival. Yorgos Lanthimos\u2019 savage period romp \u201cThe Favourite\u201d could land noms for all three of its leads: Olivia Colman, Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz. (The latter two are expected to go as supporting actresses.) Two years after \u201cMoonlight\u201d won best picture, Barry Jenkins is back with an equally lyrical and eloquent film, the James Baldwin adaptation \u201cIf Beale Street Could Talk.\u201d And lauded performances by the likes of Robert Redford (his maybe-swansong in \u201cThe Old Man & the Gun\u201d) and Richard E. Grant (alongside McCarthy in \u201cCan You Ever Forgive Me?\u201d) are brilliant because they capture the performers in their sweet spot.\n\nThere are plenty more in the mix, too, like Steve McQueen\u2019s just-opening \u201cWidows\u201d; Damien Chazelle\u2019s \u201cFirst Man,\u201d with Ryan Gosling as Neil Armstrong; and \u201cEighth Grade,\u201d the tender coming-of-age drama from Bo Burnham.\n\nThe 28-year-old Burnham boasts one of the year\u2019s most extreme accounts of reinvention. He was an internet-fueled stand-up comedian when, two years ago, he gave up the stage and grew disenchanted with social media. \u201cEighth Grade,\u201d starring 15-year-old Elsie Fisher, is about a shy girl who overcomes Instagram-amplified anxieties.\n\nMost notable of the still-unseen films is \u201cVice,\u201d the Dick Cheney biopic from Adam McKay, who several films ago charted the path from comedy to drama that Farrelly (he of the Farrelly brothers) is now steering. Christian Bale, who disappears under makeup and a 40 lb. weight gain as the former vice president, is, sight-unseen, believed to be a likely contender, so great is his reputation for transformation. Another of those \u201cnearly unrecognizable\u201d performances may follow suit: Nicole Kidman, mean and gaunt in the L.A. noir \u201cDestroyer,\u201d if votes don\u2019t instead go her way for the gay conversation therapy drama \u201cBoy Erased.\u201d\n\nThe academy members voting on those and other performances (Glenn Close! Timothee Chalamet! Yalitza Aparicio! Ethan Hawke! Regina King!) are perhaps the most fluctuating part of the whole season.

Washington is 3-2 at home this season and leads the NFC East. But after cornerback Josh Norman called out Redskins fans in the aftermath of an ugly victory at Tampa Bay, the spotlight is on the atmosphere at FedEx Field Sunday against the AFC South-leading Houston Texans. (AP Photo/Mark Tenally, File)\n\nASHBURN, Va. (AP) \u2014 Home sweet home? Not so much for Redskins players right now.\n\nEven though Washington has won three of five home games this season and leads the NFC East, cornerback Josh Norman called out Redskins fans in the aftermath of an ugly victory at Tampa Bay and said he felt they played better on the road. In the process, he put the spotlight on the atmosphere Sunday at FedEx Field when the AFC South-leading Houston Texans come to town.\n\nNorman said home games are \u201clike the other team\u2019s turf\u201d because of an infusion of opposing fans and opined that Redskins fans \u201cjust boo everything and aren\u2019t really behind us.\u201d Teammates hope that sentiment works to provide a spark of energy for the rest of the year.\n\n\u201cWe have a really good team and what it comes down to is myself and Josh, we want to be backed up, and we don\u2019t want it to feel like it\u2019s 50/50 when we\u2019re at our home field and they have as many fans as we do,\u201d running back Chris Thompson said. \u201cWe just want everybody to be there. That\u2019s it. We want our fans to be out there and just have our backs.\u201d\n\nThe Redskins organization began a concerted effort in the offseason to try to improve the fan experience at the stadium in suburban Maryland. Aware a sellout streak the team boasted had lasted the past 50 seasons would end, the decision was made to stop selling as many tickets to brokers and try to draw back in some of the disillusioned fans of a franchise that has just three playoff victories since its last Super Bowl title from the 1991 season.\n\nWashington\u2019s average attendance of 61,201 ranks 26th in the NFL, and its 74.6 percent-of-capacity crowd ranks dead last. Chief marketing officer Steve Ziff said prior to the season there\u2019s no timeline for when he expects fans to return in droves like the glory days at RFK Stadium.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to do things right for as long as it takes,\u201d Ziff said. \u201cEvery day the goal is to do things right and hopefully over time, win or lose, fans will buy into that.\u201d\n\nRight now, the Redskins are winning. At 6-3, they\u2019re two games up in the division and on pace for their first postseason appearance since 2015.\n\nBut Thompson, who has been with the team since 2013, understands there are long-term issues under the surface leading to fans staying away. Decades of mediocre on-field performance, polarizing opinions about owner Dan Snyder and the location of FedEx Field are all factors that have nothing to do with the current roster and its wins and losses.\n\n\u201cAll the responses I see all the time is, \u2018We\u2019ve been fans for 10-plus years, we\u2019ve been fans for 25 years \u2014 whatever the case may be \u2014 and we haven\u2019t gotten any results (and) the Redskins have been terrible,\u2019\u201d Thompson said. \u201cI\u2019ve been here for six years. I understand. I know. I\u2019ve been to one playoff game in six years.\u201d\n\nIf the Redskins win the division and host a playoff game, the stands will be rocking like the old days \u2014 especially if Kirk Cousins and the Minnesota Vikings are the opponent. But to get there, they could use a boost at home so players don\u2019t feel like they\u2019re in unfriendly confines.\n\nFor quarterback Alex Smith, it\u2019s all about the cadence and ability to communicate verbally.\n\n\u201cThe big thing offensively is communication that you can count on,\u201d Smith said Wednesday. \u201cTo be at home and be able to communicate, I think you can do more in the huddle and do more at the line of scrimmage.\u201d\n\nOn defense, it\u2019s the opposite. The Redskins are coming off allowing 501 yards but only three points to the Buccaneers, and they\u2019re counting on noise against DeShaun Watson and the Texans, who have won six in a row since an 0-3 start.\n\n\u201cThe fans play a big part in the way defenses can play, in the way the atmosphere is out there,\u201d linebacker Mason Foster said. \u201cWhen you get those guys going crazy in the stands, it\u2019s hard for quarterbacks to communicate, it\u2019s hard for them to audible at the line. When you get that going, I think it\u2019s a tough place to play at FedEx.\u201d\n\nNOTES: Coach Jay Gruden said left tackle Trent Williams (thumb) won\u2019t play Sunday and there\u2019s a good chance Thompson (ribs) is out, too. ... In addition to Williams and Thompson, WR Jamison Crowder (ankle), CB Quinton Dunbar (shin), S Montae Nicholson (illness) and K Dustin Hopkins (groin) did not practice.

Kennedy helped inspire a nation to land a man on the moon \u2014 but he never got the chance to tweet about it.\n\nThat\u2019s changing.\n\nThe JFK Library Foundation has launched a new project they\u2019re calling \u201cWords Count\u201d that takes quotes from the nation\u2019s 35th president and tweets them out using the @JohnFKennedy Twitter handle. The account features exact quotations said or written by Kennedy as president.\n\nThe goal is to use a 21st-century tool to pass the baton of Kennedy\u2019s soaring oratory to a new generation who only know him from history books and news clips.\n\n\u201cThere are many things that President Kennedy said on a variety of issues that effected domestic and international concerns that are as relevant in today\u2019s world as they were in the early \u201960s,\u201d Steven Rothstein, executive director at the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation, said Wednesday.\n\nIs the project also a subtle swipe at the President Donald Trump\u2019s more bombastic use of social media? Rothstein won\u2019t say, although an online promo for the project pointedly notes, \u201cThe words of a president count.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really letting people draw their own conclusion of what they think,\u201d Rothstein said. \u201cWe want them to be inspired by the big ideas that John Kennedy said.\u201d\n\nMany of the tweets echo contemporary political debates, from immigration \u2014 \u201cEverywhere immigrants have enriched and strengthened the fabric of American life\u201d \u2014 to poverty \u2014 \u201cIf a free society cannot help the many who are poor, it cannot save the few who are rich.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s even a quote on the importance of a free press.\n\n\u201cAnd so it is to the printing press \u2014 to the recorder of man\u2019s deeds, the keeper of his conscience, the courier of his news \u2014 that we look for strength and assistance, confident that with your help man will be what he was born to be: free and independent.\u201d\n\nReaction online has ranged from the supportive to the unkind, with many referencing Kennedy\u2019s assassination in 1963 or questioning how a dead person can tweet. Others were quick to compare the Democrat from Massachusetts to the current occupant of the White House.\n\nAnother suggested a possible future tweet \u2014 \u201cAsk not what your country can do for you. But what YOU can do for your COUNTRY\u201d \u2014 echoing one of Kennedy\u2019s most memorable lines from his 1961 inaugural address.\n\nThe practice of taking the words of a historical figure to create a Twitter account isn\u2019t new.

CNN has visited. Erin Brockovich has weighed in.\n\nPick your narrative, the long-suffering customers of the Martin County Water District can probably fit it.\n\nWhat has not emerged: A ready source of money to fix decrepit water lines, the system\u2019s most urgent physical need.\n\nThe Kentucky Public Service Commission on Nov. 5 set the stage for finally bringing in competent management \u2014 from outside \u2014 while also approving a permanent rate increase and a pair of surcharges to repair the \u201ccrumbling water system\u201d and pay down its $1.1 million debt.\n\nIf the district fails to meet deadlines for hiring expert management and submitting a rehab plan, the PSC said it will cancel the surcharges and seek to appoint a receiver to run the utility.\n\nBravo for this PSC, which seems to mean business \u2014 after decades of commissions that let Martin County\u2019s chronic mismanagement slide.\n\nTwo grants totaling $4.6 million announced early this year by Rep. Hal Rogers and Gov. Matt Bevin don\u2019t directly address the most urgent problem: unaccounted-for water loss of 64 percent.\n\nMost of the water that leaves the treatment plant never reaches anyone\u2019s tap. Broken lines account for most of that loss, though theft or customers not being billed could cause some. Groundwater enters the broken lines as pressure fluctuates. The result: frequent outages and boil-water advisories, discolored and smelly tap water. Those who can afford bottled water use it for drinking and cooking. Many in this poor county can\u2019t afford it. The district estimates the cost of needed upgrades and repairs at $13.5 million.\n\nWith the rate increase and if both surcharges take effect, by next year the average Martin countian using 4,000 gallons of water a month will pay $57.53. That\u2019s almost $21 more than they would pay in Lexington.\n\nMore frequent, smaller rate increases \u2014 spent on regular maintenance \u2014 would have been cheaper in the end. But a politically-appointed board shied from raising rates, which is one of the reasons the system is, as the PSC said, on the brink of collapse.\n\nMartin County is the state\u2019s worst water district, says the PSC, but it\u2019s far from the only one plagued by failing infrastructure, outages and frequent boil-water advisories, raising two points:\n\n? The legislature should authorize the PSC and Division of Water to deal swiftly with such crises. As PSC chairman Michael J. Schmitt of Paintsville wrote in a concurring opinion, \u201cthe public interest would be best served if the Commission had the authority to immediately seize control of Martin County\u2019s water utility and put a management team in place.\u201d Instead, Schmitt said, the only options are a drawn-out court fight to appoint a receiver, who would be paid through even higher rates, or trying to force a merger. \u201cUnfortunately, surrounding water districts are faced with similar management problems and it is unlikely they could provide either the financial stability or the managerial expertise required to remedy the problems,\u201d Schmitt wrote.\n\n? Rural places facing population decline are going to need low-interest loans to maintain infrastructure. Federal loan programs, however, are geared toward expanding water infrastructure, which benefits exurban areas more than rural places. At the very least, authorities should allow the $4.6 million in grants from abandoned mine lands funds and the Appalachian Regional Commission to be reprioritized to meet Martin County\u2019s most pressing needs.\n\nOnline: https://www.kentucky.com/\n\n___\n\nNov. 12\n\nThe Daily Independent of Ashland on a grant that will allow a nonprofit to expand mental health services for more than 3,000 children:\n\nAnyone who has had a child who suffers from mental illness knows how important it is to get professional treatment.\n\nMany patients see great improvement when treated by a professional. The treatments can, quite literally, be life changing. Add to the mix the fact that children are going through the most formative years of their lives and this access to treatment is doubly important.\n\nThis brings us to the incredible news from Pathways \u2014 that the nonprofit in Eastern Kentucky has received a $930,000 grant from the United Health Foundation. The three-year grant was announced this month. It will allow Pathways to expand mental health services for over 3,000 children across its 10-county service area using telehealth technology.\n\n\u201cWe will install telehealth technology in all 16 of our outpatient offices and our specialty residential units to connect children to a specialist through interactive, safe and secure audio and video,\u201d said Pathways CEO Dr. Kim McClanahan.\n\nThe children will be connected to child and adolescent psychiatrists, eliminating the need for families to drive as long as two hours to access a child\u2019s mental health specialist.\n\nKentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services Secretary Adam Meier said the state is often finding that children are overmedicated because they don\u2019t have access to appropriate care.\n\n\u201cThis is another way for the expansion of care, appropriate care, appropriate services that can help eliminate some of these issues that we\u2019re seeing,\u201d he said, adding that the state is also seeing higher rates of suicide in youth.\n\nThe United Health Foundation said it wants to help children with a long-term goal of also being able to expand the services to adults. The telehealth equipment will be starting a pilot in two weeks.\n\nThere are a couple of important facts here that need to be noted. One, as mentioned previously, mental health care for kids is so important, and we really love the idea of reducing prescription medications for kids in these circumstances whenever possible. Another fact is that, in rural eastern Kentucky, technology can help bridge a lot of gaps. Technology is a double edged sword in our view. There have been many great benefits to the transformation of our society due to computers, the internet, and now robotics. There are also significant negatives \u2014 the loss of manufacturing jobs is just one example.\n\nToday we have an example of how technology can help Eastern Kentucky by linking kids and their families to the resources they need. A special thanks goes out today to the United Health Foundation, the leadership at Pathways and all those involved in making this project a reality. It is an incredible public service.\n\nOnline: https://www.dailyindependent.com/\n\n___\n\nNov. 14\n\nThe News-Enterprise of Elizabethtown on mental illness:\n\nWith what authorities compared to a precise military attack, 28-year-old Ian David Long methodically shot and killed 12 people last week at a California nightclub.\n\nLong, a U.S. Marine veteran, frequented the Borderline Bar & Grill. This time, he took with him evil intention, smoke bombs and a .45-caliber handgun. Once inside, he opened fire, reportedly uploading chilling messages on social media accounts at some point during the rampage. After killing a dozen people, including a Ventura County Sheriff\u2019s Office sergeant, at the scene, Long turned the gun on himself.\n\nLong is the latest in a line of mass shooters with reported mental health and behavioral issues.\n\nIn April, a Ventura County Sheriff\u2019s Office mental health crisis team responded to Long\u2019s home after neighbors called with concerns about yelling and crashing noises inside. Deputies and counselors choose not to take Long into custody on a psychiatric hold, determining he was not a threat to himself or others.\n\nOthers around him described Long to be irrational at times, verbally violent toward his mother with whom he lived and behaviorally volatile. Former high school coaches described him as a \u201cticking time bomb,\u201d one who quickly became irate when he disagreed with them. A mental health counselor suggested the likelihood that Long suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of his combat experiences in Afghanistan.\n\nLong\u2019s is a recurring story. In the aftermath of killings, many report seeing signs of a potentially violent downward spiral. Few report these concerns. Little comes as a result of the unease voiced by those who do speak out. And law-enforcement officers are put in precarious and difficult position of having to act like mental health experts while carrying out police duties.\n\nMental health is an epidemic across the country, impacting law enforcement\u2019s ability to protect the communities they serve. It has been reported that 64 percent of the roughly 11 million people revolving through American jails and detention centers suffer from some form of mental illness. One in five people in the U.S. have or will experience mental illness.\n\nAccording to research, those suffering from mental illness are more likely to be victims rather than commit violent acts. But researchers also point to a causal link between the propensity for acts of violence with PTSD and other mental illnesses. Where drug or alcohol abuse also is present, the risk of violent behavior increases substantially.\n\nA recent forum at Elizabethtown\u2019s Pritchard Community Center brought law enforcement and health care system experts together to discuss best practices being used in communities across the country to deal with the problem.\n\nHosted by the Kentucky Justice and Public Safety Cabinet, the Federal Bureau of Justice Assistance and the Crime and Justice Institute, the forum sought to discuss law enforcement, first responder and criminal justice responses to behavioral health challenges.\n\nWhile these experts discussed new and more effective strategies to divert those in mental crises to the health care system rather than just placing them in jail, a larger common denominator is present everywhere.\n\nState and national funding falls short to effectively deal with the burgeoning crisis of mental illness. An adequately funded comprehensive approach is needed if the epidemic is to be impacted positively.\n\nFederal and state lawmakers must recognize this need and provide the financial resources states and communities require providing the help that is desperately needed.\n\nOnline: http://www.thenewsenterprise.com/", "Click to copy\n\nClick to copy https://apnews.com/cb02374b76db43e1be595928bb12e3ae\n\nBlake Snell of the Tampa Bay Rays wins AL Cy Young Award\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Blake Snell of the Tampa Bay Rays wins AL Cy Young Award.", "Man dies in woods after falling down embankment\n\nSEATTLE (AP) \u2014 A 64-year-old man was found dead in the woods near Beaver Lake in Snohomish County.\n\nThe Seattle Times reports officials received a report around 8 a.m. Wednesday of an abandoned vehicle near milepost 43 along Mountain Loop Highway, according to the Snohomish County Sheriff\u2019s Office Search and Rescue team.\n\nThe sheriff\u2019s office says deputies searched the residence where the car is registered but didn\u2019t find the owner.\n\nThe agency sent a K-9 unit to search the area surrounding the abandoned car, and found the man half a mile from his vehicle in the woods.\n\nOfficers believe the man became disoriented and fell off a steep embankment.\n\nThe county medical examiner is working to determine how the man died.", "NORTH LITTLE ROCK, Ark.

(AP) \u2014 Chicago Bears quarterback Mitchell Trubisky seemed to care little Wednesday about being selected NFC offensive player of the week.\n\nWith the Bears clicking on offense at an elevated rate, Trubisky is too focused on improving some gaps of inconsistency in the attack to care about honors or criticism.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s cool, but people talked so bad about me last week, so why should this week be any different?\u201d Trubisky said. \u201cSo I got recognized for playing well, I expect to play well. Coach Nagy expects me to play well.\n\n\u201cI got better from the week before, so I\u2019m embracing that process, just continuously getting better and better.\u201d\n\nThe Bears (6-3) head into their showdown for first place in the NFC North on Sunday night at Soldier Field against the defending division champion Minnesota Vikings (5-3-1) surprisingly strong on both sides of the football, but still seeing obvious areas to improve.\n\nAnd Matt Nagy would rather they\u2019re focused on Minnesota and a game flexed to prime time than awards or other diversions.\n\n\u201cWe talk about poison, the noise, we talk about earmuffs, we talk about horse blinders,\u201d the coach said. \u201cYou know, don\u2019t worry about anything, you just keep playing. If you played a good game great, now next game. And if you played a bad game, now next game, and you just stay straight ahead.\u201d\n\nTrubisky\u2019s career-best 355-yard passing day last Sunday gave the Bears a 34-22 win over the Detroit Lions for their first divisional victory since Halloween 2016. He went 23 for 30 and had three touchdown passes, while also running for a TD.\n\n\u201cI think just good feet, good eyes and I just played with conviction,\u201d Trubisky said. \u201cI made a decision that I was just in a good mind state, just go out there and play confident.\u201d\n\nTrubisky has four 300-yard passing games, tied for best by a Bears quarterback in a single season. It\u2019s fostering anticipation he\u2019ll improve even more.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s slowly improving, which I love,\u201d Nagy said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be an overnight thing; he had a good game and we want to continue to have those good games. But there\u2019s a process to it.\u201d\n\nTrubisky made his first start against the Vikings last year in a 20-17 loss, and threw an interception to Harrison Smith in the closing minutes to seal the verdict.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019ve grown a lot since that play,\u201d Trubisky said. \u201cI\u2019m not the same player, not even close. I\u2019ve got better since that instance and I\u2019m excited for the opportunity this weekend.\u201d\n\nThe Bears won a game over Carolina later in the year when Trubisky completed only four passes.\n\nSo much has changed with the Bears since that point in the fifth game last year, including Nagy\u2019s hiring. The trade for pass rusher Khalil Mack and the turnaround under their new coach have led to renewed vitality at Halas Hall. They\u2019ve become a hot ticket for the television networks, as their home game with the Los Angeles Rams was flexed Wednesday into a Sunday night contest.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great vibe around the building now,\u201d Trubisky said. \u201cThe culture has definitely changed and there\u2019s a better vibe around the city in how people view the Bears and how they see us.\u201d\n\nThe offense is still only 20th at passing but is 10th in touchdown passes with 19. Trubisky\u2019s passer rating of 101.6 is higher than those of Cam Newton, Ben Roethlisberger, Deshaun Watson, Tom Brady and Aaron Rodgers.\n\nYet Nagy sounded a cautionary note earlier this week about the team\u2019s running attack.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t go through this thing and be one-dimensional,\u201d Nagy said. \u201cIt\u2019s just too easy for defenses.\u201d\n\nJordan Howard hasn\u2019t had a 100-yard rushing game this season and the Bears had 64 and 54 yards rushing the last two games, respectively.\n\n\u201cKeep doing our job and the passing game can keep airing it \u2014 it will open up the run,\u201d tackle Charles Leno Jr. said. \u201cWe\u2019ve just got to get (Howard) and (Tarik Cohen) the ball more and those guys will make plays, and we\u2019re just going to do a better job.\u201d\n\nThe other problem area is the kicking game after Cody Parkey nailed the uprights four times on misses in last week\u2019s game. So Parkey was slated to practice kicking Wednesday night at Soldier Field because Sunday\u2019s game is at night.\n\n\u201cI mean, it can\u2019t hurt,\u201d Parkey said.\n\nParkey was lampooned on the \u201cTonight Show\u201d by Jimmy Fallon for hitting the uprights. Parkey sounded a bit like Trubisky when asked if he\u2019d heard this.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Parkey said. \u201cI (couldn\u2019t) care less.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) \u2014 Anchorage police have released the name of the woman killed in a weekend hit-and-run crash.\n\nPolice say 35-year-old Michele Kulukhon (kul-LUK-hon) died early Saturday night.\n\nThe driver of an SUV, 71-old Ruti Malietufa (ROO-tee mal-ee-eh-TOO-fah), is charged with a felony in the case.

(AP) \u2014 Dominion Energy said in a long-awaited report on Wednesday that it would cost billions of dollars to recycle Virginia\u2019s toxic coal ash or move it to lined landfills, an endeavor that customers would pay for over several years.\n\nEnvironmental groups and some lawmakers said the cost would be well worth the effort as some aging storage facilities leak chemicals or potentially lay vulnerable to hurricanes.\n\n\u201cThis report shows that we can solve this problem forever and create some jobs while we\u2019re at it,\u201d said Democratic state Sen.

(AP) \u2014 The Detroit Lions have allowed 16 sacks in the past two games \u2014 and this week isn\u2019t off to a good start either for the offensive line.\n\nThe Lions put guard T.J. Lang on injured reserve with a neck injury Wednesday. Lang has missed three games this season, including last weekend\u2019s loss at Chicago. Detroit signed cornerback Mike Ford to the active roster from the practice squad and signed safety David Jones to the practice squad.\n\n\u201cHe was a good veteran leader,\u201d center Graham Glasgow said. \u201cAll of us will need to pick up the slack a little bit on that end.\u201d\n\nThe 31-year-old Lang is in his second season with the Lions after playing eight with Green Bay. Lang signed a three-year deal with Detroit before the 2017 season, returning to his home area. He was born in Royal Oak, went to high school in Bloomfield Hills and went to college at Eastern Michigan.\n\nLang hasn\u2019t played a full 16 games since the 2014 season, but he\u2019s also never played fewer than 12 in his career. That obviously changes now. Lang has also dealt with back, concussion and hip problems this year.\n\nGuard Kenny Wiggins, who signed with the Lions in March, has started the three games that Lang missed so far this season.\n\n\u201cSame way I always approach it,\u201d Wiggins said. \u201cI\u2019ve been preparing all year like I was a starter. Now it\u2019s just how it\u2019s going to be now from now on.\u201d\n\nDetroit (3-6) has lost three straight. The Lions yielded 10 sacks against Minnesota two weekends ago and six against the Bears.\n\n\u201cIt just hasn\u2019t been our best performances,\u201d Glasgow said. \u201cPart of it has just been the situations that have been, just throughout the game. Down by a few scores, trying to come back and get some points on the board. It\u2019s a lot of pass pro, a lot of pass rush.\u201d\n\nThe Lions have invested a lot in recent years to try to improve their offensive line. Detroit has used four of its past seven first-round draft picks on offensive linemen. Two of those selections \u2014 Taylor Decker and rookie Frank Ragnow \u2014 have started every game for the Lions this season.\n\nLang, however, has been limited, and his future seems uncertain. Detroit\u2019s running game has improved a bit, but the sack totals have stood out over the past two weeks. The Lions have fallen behind early, which makes it harder for them to take advantage of their running game.\n\nQuarterback Matthew Stafford has attempted 118 passes over the past three games.\n\n\u201cWe have to do better as a line and as an offensive unit,\u201d Glasgow said. \u201cYou never plan to pass the ball every play. But, I mean, that\u2019s just how it works.

The political party divisions create barriers to understanding and healthy debate.\n\nToxic rhetoric has engendered distrust of our institutions, created confusion over what is fact and fiction, and has fueled angry reactionaryism on one extreme and resistance on the other.\n\nWe need to focus now on the issues most important to Tennesseans.\n\nThose issues include the economy, health care and jobs.\n\nThey spurred 60 percent of Tennessee voters to vote for Donald Trump as president in 2016.\n\nDespite his frequent rhetorical hyperbole, Trump remains popular in Tennessee.\n\nHowever, there are some issues still causing heartache two years after his election:\n\n\u2014Gaps in affordable health insurance\n\n\u2014Underperforming veterans hospitals\n\n\u2014Closures or downsizing of rural hospitals\n\n...\n\nThere have been steps taken to help address many of these issues, but more needs to be done.\n\nAt the same time, a U.S. senator must have broader conversations about the U.S.\u2019s role in the world and involvement in war and conflicts; the growing debt and deficits; stewardship of interstate environmental treasures and resources; and, yes, immigration policy.\n\nThe U.S. Senate is a deliberative body designed to allow for careful, civil debate on serious issues of the day.\n\nTennessee\u2019s U.S. senior Sen. Lamar Alexander recently shared with The Tennessean his assessment of multiple examples of how bipartisan cooperation has delivered solutions from the opioid epidemic to fair pay for songwriters.\n\nAt a recent luncheon for the Tennessee World Affairs Council, retiring Sen. Bob Corker said U.S. institutions are strong and the country is working as it should despite the president\u2019s tweets.\n\nHowever, many Americans think Congress is broken and the majority is acquiescing to the president as opposed to acting as a check on his authority.\n\nWhile it is logical that political parties would push the government in one ideological direction, the U.S. Constitution established three separate, but equal, branches of government to keep watch on one another.\n\nThis will be especially important in a Congress that will now by dominated by Republicans in the Senate and Democrats in the House.\n\nRegarding the judicial branch, there may be opportunities in the near future to come to debate and confirm more U.S. Supreme Court justices.\n\nA more civil process should take effect than the one demonstrated with the confirmation of new Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nTennessee historically has been a state that has produced moderate senators who serve as the conscience of the nation.\n\nHowever, the state\u2019s politics overall have changed and become more right-leaning over the years, something you noted in your victory speech: \u201cTennesseans want a conservative U.S. senator who wants to take Tennessee values and put them to work for you in Washington, D.C.\u201d\n\nYou also graciously thanked your opponent, former Gov.

We finally got a reprieve from those depressing election commercials and mailings. Judging by the extremes that candidates resort to demean opponents, it\u2019s fair to ask: Have they no shame? Consider that a rhetorical question.\n\nThe pertinent question is this: Did you vote?\n\nFor those who didn\u2019t, a common justification is because their vote won\u2019t make a difference. Chalk that up as an excuse for apathy.\n\nVotes do matter. Take last week when two candidates for Alcoa City Commission went to bed not knowing if they\u2019d won or lost. Ballots had Mayor Don Mull leading Tanya Henderson Martin by a single vote. ... With a total of six more absentee votes than Mull, Martin was elected by a margin that can be counted on one hand.\n\nGiven that Mull has served as an Alcoa commissioner since 1971 and mayor since 1983, and that Martin will be the first African-American woman ever elected to serve on the Alcoa City Commission, that five-vote margin is historic.\n\nAt the national level, attention focused on the unusually high voter turnout for the midterms. Politicians and handlers sharpened their barbs to poke at their respective bases, and the bases responded.\n\nAs updated Sunday by the United States Election Project, an information source for the U.S. electoral system based at the University of Florida, the turnout rate for the 2018 General Election is predicted to be 49.1 percent. That\u2019s an educated guess, realizing that the results are not yet certified and votes are still being counted in some places.\n\nThat would put the projected total ballots around 115,662,500 \u2014 the first time an American midterm election has exceeded 100 million votes. The last time the percentage of eligible Americans voting in a midterm reached 49 percent was 1966. Both were good years for voting participation, but the number of voters remained fewer than the no-shows.\n\nHow far do we have to look to find a majority of eligible voters taking part in a midterm? That would be 104 years ago, four years before the armistice was signed in 1918 that officially ended World War I \u2014 the date we celebrated Sunday as Veterans Day.\n\nAn estimated 116,708 military personnel died in World War I. Battlefield deaths by American soldiers in all wars is estimated at around 660,000. But even that is not enough to get most eligible Americans to vote in a midterm election. Or as some might put it, to take the trouble to vote.\n\nOver many years, hundreds of thousands of American gave their lives so fellow citizens could exercise their rights to vote. These patriots took the trouble and made the sacrifice.\n\nIt is the height of arrogance for anyone to say they don\u2019t vote because their ballot will not determine the winner. Who elected them the decider for the rest of us?\n\nConsidering there are so many \u2014 most actually \u2014 who just don\u2019t care, maybe they\u2019re right. Maybe their communities, states and nation are better off without their votes. An uninformed vote is worse than no vote at all.\n\nOnline: https://www.thedailytimes.com/\n\n____\n\nNov. 13\n\nKingsport Times News on modifying hospital names:\n\nBranding is important, not only because of the impression it makes on consumers but in giving them a sense of what they can expect, as Ballad Health demonstrates.\n\nResidents of Northeast Tennessee and Southwest Virginia may have expected big Ballad Health signs to pop up throughout the region on the hospitals that it operates. That\u2019s the typical approach that big organizations take when they pick up other businesses.\n\nBut that\u2019s not the direction Ballad has chosen. That\u2019s not its stated focus for its hospitals, large and small. Ballad said it wants to serve communities, and that\u2019s what motivated its branding as the result of its creation by merging the Wellmont and Mountain States hospital groups.\n\nThe former Mountain State\u2019s Indian Path Medical Center just got a name change to Indian Path Community Hospital. Mountain View Regional Medical Center in Norton has become Mountain View Regional Hospital; Russell County Medical Center in Lebanon is now Russell County Hospital; and Unicoi County Memorial Hospital has changed its name to just Unicoi County Hospital.\n\nBallad said the name changes intend to \u201creflect both their important roles within the health system and their deep ties to the communities they serve.\u201d\n\n\u201cBeing part of Ballad Health means these community hospitals are part of an integrated system that includes a children\u2019s hospital, trauma care, and access to some of the nation\u2019s leading care in highly specialized services. But because Ballad Health is governed by people who live in this region with deep ties to the community, we also believe strongly in the role of rural hospitals as community assets contributing to Ballad Health\u2019s strength,\u201d said Eric Deaton, Ballad Health\u2019s senior vice president of market operations.\n\n\u201cBecause of this, we are happy to announce that all our hospital names will continue to reflect their deep connections with the communities they serve.\u201d\n\nRather than changing every hospital name to Ballad Health, it was determined that the system would instead adopt a standard naming convention that incorporates each facility\u2019s existing name and identity within the community, the merged hospital system noted.\n\nIn order to help patients throughout the region easily navigate the health system and identify the breadth of services offered in each location, the term \u201cmedical center\u201d will now be used only in the names of Ballad Health\u2019s three tertiary facilities, reflecting common practices among other health systems nationally.\n\nSmart move.\n\nOnline: http://www.timesnews.net/", "Beatrice man gets up to 20 years in prison in sex abuse case\n\nBEATRICE, Neb.

(AP) \u2014 Four years after South Dakota enthusiastically voted to allow Deadwood casino patrons to play keno, craps and roulette, a gambling industry group plans to ask state lawmakers for a 2020 ballot measure to bring legal sports betting to the historic mining town.\n\nThe push comes after the U.S. Supreme Court in May cleared the way for all states to offer legal sports betting; so far, just five do, but Pennsylvania is about to join soon and others are considering it. The South Dakota constitutional amendment would help keep the Black Hills city competitive as a gambling destination, Deadwood Gaming Association executive director Mike Rodman said.\n\n\u201cWe look at this as just another opportunity for marketing of Deadwood and keeping Deadwood successful,\u201d Rodman said. \u201cWe just don\u2019t want to be left behind, you know, we want to be a part of that national conversation.\u201d\n\nKnown as the city where Wild Bill Hickok was gunned down in 1876 while playing poker in a saloon, Deadwood got legalized gambling in 1989 that has helped it become a force in South Dakota\u2019s major tourism industry. In 2017, visitor spending in the county that encompasses Deadwood \u2014 and other popular destinations \u2014 was $444 million, or nearly 30 percent of tourist spending in the Black Hills region, according to the state Department of Tourism.\n\nBut Deadwood\u2019s casinos have struggled in recent years with declining revenues, though Rodman said operators hope to end 2018 with slight growth.\n\nRodman said an improving economy is likely the overriding factor in boosting revenue this year, but said the gaming industry isn\u2019t letting up, continuing to add events and entertainment options for visitors. He said It\u2019s difficult to know how sports wagering would affect Deadwood gambling revenues, which were roughly $100 million in 2017. He estimated it could bring in roughly $1.5 to $2 million.\n\nToby Keehn, owner of sports bar Mustang Sally\u2019s, said the change would help in Deadwood\u2019s off-season. He said he would like to see more people come to town on weekends to watch sports and put $20 on their favorite football team.\n\n\u201cYou can roll a bowling ball down Main Street sometimes this time of year,\u201d said Keehn, whose participation in sports wagering would depend on how the state taxed it.\n\nRodman said the gaming group envisions players would have to be physically at a casino to place a bet on a sporting event. The proposed constitutional amendment would give the Legislature the authority to implement the wagering in Deadwood and at tribal casinos. If it got voter\u2019s blessing in 2020, Rodman anticipated it could be available by July 2021.\n\nRodman said sports betting is already happening illegally in South Dakota; the amendment would give the state the opportunity to \u201cclean that up\u201d and ensure that people who want to participate can do it in a safe, regulated manner, he said.\n\nThe Legislature can decide to place a constitutional change before voters or amendment supporters could collect thousands of signatures to put it on the ballot. In 2014, 57 percent of voters approved an amendment authorizing lawmakers to allow keno, craps and roulette in Deadwood.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Lee Qualm said he opposes the plan set to be debated during the upcoming 2019 session. But he said the chamber\u2019s Republican caucus hasn\u2019t yet talked about it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be a very heated discussion on it for sure,\u201d Qualm said.", "Recent editorials from Mississippi newspapers:\n\n___\n\nNov. 12\n\nThe Daily Leader of Brookhaven on Sen.

Cindy Hyde-Smith said that if cattle farmer Colin Hutchinson \u201cinvited me to a public hanging, I\u2019d be on the front row,\u201d it was tone deaf and irresponsible. But the single comment alone does not make her a racist, as some have suggested.\n\nIn a statement after the words from the Nov. 2 event became public, Hyde-Smith said she used an \u201cexaggerated expression of regard.\u201d She was essentially saying that she liked Hutchinson so much, she would accept an invitation from him to go anywhere, even to something as horrible as a public hanging.\n\nWe get it. But the words she chose to make that point are not acceptable, particularly coming from a U.S. senator hailing from a state with a racist past.\n\nHyde-Smith\u2019s statement went on to say that \u201cany attempt to turn this into a negative connotation is ridiculous.\u201d Those are also not the right words. Her lack of apology is not wise.\n\nThe decision to not apologize was a coordinated move from her campaign and not necessarily her own. Making light of the matter is a mistake. As is suggesting those who were upset or offended are \u201cridiculous.\u201d\n\nCurrent political motivations aside, Hyde-Smith must recognize she represents all Mississippians. That includes those who didn\u2019t think twice about the comment and did not view it as racist and those who were deeply disturbed by her words.\n\nShe should apologize and admit the words should not have been spoken. To do anything less only gives her political opponent ammunition heading into the Nov. 27 runoff. It also reinforces an unfortunate, yet sometimes accurate, depiction of her state. Admitting a mistake may not be politically wise, but it\u2019s the right thing to do and voters will respond to her if she does so.\n\nGov. Phil Bryant did his best at a press conference Monday to calm the waters, but Hyde-Smith would only say that she stands by the statement she released Sunday, refusing to comment further. \u201cI can tell you there was no ill-will in her heart,\u201d Bryant said.\n\nWe believe that, but Mississippians need to hear those words spoken from Hyde-Smith.\n\nOnline: https://www.dailyleader.com/\n\n___\n\nNov. 13\n\nThe Greenwood Commonwealth on the meaning of expiration dates:\n\nA recent story from the medicine information website Drugs.com addressed a pertinent question: Can you safely use medicine that has reached its expiration date?\n\nThere are many ways to answer the question, and the best way to start is by knowing what the expiration date means. The story says it\u2019s the final date that a drug manufacturer guarantees the \u201cfull potency and safety\u201d of a medication.\n\nHowever, for most medications, the expiration date is an arbitrary selection, often two or three years past the date of manufacture. The actual stability of a drug may be much longer than the expiration date, but that is rarely tested.\n\nAs for the safety of old medication, the story said solid products, such as tablets and capsules, appear to be the most stable after their expiration date. Liquids and medicine that requires refrigeration are less likely to be as strong as intended.\n\nSpecific medicines more likely to be unsafe after their expiration date include insulin, nitroglycerin pills and vaccines. An antibiotic past its date also is a concern, as the body may develop a resistance to the drug if its age makes it less potent than intended.\n\nAs for whether to use expired medicine, common sense is the best guide. The story says it\u2019s always best to use medication that has not expired, especially those that treat chronic or life-threatening diseases.\n\nIn most cases, there is no evidence that expired medicine is unsafe. But using that medicine may not provide the expected relief.\n\nHere\u2019s one more interesting item in the story: Pharmacies, hospitals, nursing homes and individuals throw away billions of dollars worth of medication each year based on expiration dates.

In a country of 326 million people, the voice and the vote of one person might seem irrelevant, but when several million shrug their shoulders and don\u2019t head to the polls, the impact of indifference can have vast repercussions.\n\nThe foundation of America was built on everyone using their voice in bring change, and far too often in this country we take democracy - and the right to vote that comes with it - for granted.\n\nIt is imperative that we, as a country, always remember the importance and the sacrifices made for all of us to have these rights.\n\nBut it goes so far beyond the voting booth, it will be two more years before the United States has another major election. We would encourage everyone to stay involved and interested in what is happening on the federal level, and to keep an ear to the ground in the months between elections.\n\nRemember what candidates do and don\u2019t do, hold them accountable for their action or inaction and always remember that we all have the power to change the country.\n\nOnline: https://www.oxfordeagle.com/", "CHICAGO (AP) \u2014 A man who pleaded not guilty to trying to detonate what he thought was a bomb outside of a Chicago bar in 2012 wants to change his plea.\n\nLawyers for Adel Daoud, who was arrested in an FBI sting, filed a motion Wednesday seeking to have the 25-year-old suburban Chicago man enter Alford pleas to all of the charges against him, including attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction.\n\nAn Alford plea isn\u2019t an admission of guilt but is an acknowledgement that prosecutors have enough evidence to convict.\n\nThe judge will decide whether to accept the Alford pleas.

Unfortunately, they all lost, and this is nothing new \u2014 the better candidate has been losing at the polls, we\u2019d guess, since colonial days, when candidates plied voters with \u201cliquid cheer\u201d to win their allegiance.\n\nMany things affect elections. Money has an outsized and pernicious influence, and so does party loyalty. Too often, voters overrule their own common sense out of allegiance to a party and vote for someone unfit for the office. We have seen this on both sides \u2014 with Donald Trump, for example, and also with Andrew Cuomo.\n\nWe also allow political parties to make choices for us, when we cast ballots for candidates of our party whom we know nothing about. This is an abdication of our responsibility as citizens \u2014 an uninformed choice is worthless.\n\nSome of the unfortunate aspects of American elections have been exacerbated by President Trump, although there is a hopeful note in the energy \u2014 for and against him \u2014 now coursing through the American public. We are heartened by the larger-than-usual turnout for the midterms and the greater engagement in political life evident across the country.\n\nIt may be, for those who feel that law and order and our political institutions are under attack, that this administration has been a necessary wake-up call. If our institutions are worth saving, it\u2019s up to us to do it. The 2020 election is likely to generate even more interest, and perhaps we will emerge from that one with more hope for the future and unity as a country than we are feeling now.\n\nOnline: https://bit.ly/2RRUCOM\n\n___\n\nThe Poughkeepsie Journal on legalized sports betting and its effect on New York.\n\nNov. 14\n\nThe state\u2019s abject failure to define the parameters for legalized sports wagering has many consequences - and, oddly, you apparently can count bridge traffic among them.\n\nIn a peculiar story, the Associated Press conveyed how one Staten Island man runs his business by crossing over to New Jersey, where sports gambling is legal, pulls over and logs into a mobile account. He then places his bets and returns home. The Garden State, in fact, is capitalizing far more broadly, as many New Yorkers can easily cross the border, whether by bridge, tunnel or land, to place the bets that they like.\n\nIn an earlier story, Jeff Gural, who manages the northern New Jersey track, told The AP, \u201cNew York did me such a favor by not passing sports betting. That leaves me the entirety of New York City, Long Island, Westchester County. There are 15 million people that live within 20 miles of the Meadowlands. They gave me a tremendous gift.\u201d\n\nWhen Gov. Andrew Cuomo and state lawmakers get back to business next year, they should rectify this problem pronto.\n\nLast year, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that states can regulate sports wagering if Congress elects not to do so. New Jersey has reasonably challenged the ban, pointing out that such wagering is allowed in Nevada and Delaware. New York had no reason to delay, particularly when you consider state voters already had given their blessing to allow casinos to operate sports books if federal law changed \u2014 or if the court ruled such activities as lawful. New York voters made that decision about five years ago when they approved an state constitutional amendment allowing casino operations to expand beyond sovereign Native American land.\n\nRegardless, New York lawmakers decided to delay addressing the sports wagering issue this past legislative session. Perhaps that was just the easiest decision to make considering November elections were coming. Legalized sports betting has its critics; there are undeniable concerns about gambling addiction and the emotional and financial toll that can take on people and families. The same holds true for legalizing casino gambling. But supporters counter that legalizing sports gambling not only will strengthen the state\u2019s casino industry and the jobs it creates, it will bring this popular form of betting out in the open, making it a regulated, legitimate and taxable operation.\n\nThree good reasons for the state to act sooner rather than later, especially since, once again, it is losing revenue to a neighboring state.\n\nOnline: https://bit.ly/2Q5KaGp\n\n___\n\nThe Leader-Herald on giving during Thanksgiving.\n\nNov. 4\n\nMost of us are lucky enough to not have to worry about where our Thanksgiving meal is going to come from. Unfortunately, there are literally hundreds of people in Fulton County who live alone, don\u2019t make enough money, are unable to drive or do not have transportation in order to enjoy the feast we often take for granted.\n\nFortunately, our area is blessed with a number of local churches and organizations which offer free Thanksgiving dinners to local residents. It is a huge undertaking that stretches out over several days and requires the help of dozens of volunteers and monetary donations.\n\nOne of those organizations is the Twin Cities Council of Churches, which each year offers a delivered or take-out option. Families can pre-order up to five dinners and they can be picked up, or the organization has volunteers who will deliver the meals.\n\nThe more than 30-year-old program is in a corner. They are in dire need of volunteers and donations to make the program successful. Thanksgiving is a week away and the clock is ticking.\n\nThey have less than half the number of turkeys they will need to provide the more than 1,000 meals and only nine drivers so far to deliver the meals.\n\nChurches and other organizations are chipping in. The youth group at Grace Lutheran Church in Johnstown is baking 20 pies and the Concordia Club will be cooking the turkeys.\n\nThe Deli Warehouse, also in Johnstown, offered non-turkey food at a \u201csignificant discount\u201d and will be delivering $1,700 worth food this week for the dinner.\n\nThe Church of the Holy Spirit in Gloversville will be the host site for the meals, where volunteers will box up the dinners for delivery.\n\nBut what is needed the most to make the event a success is more volunteers. People are needed to donate turkeys or pies. Others are needed to assist on Nov. 21 and 22 to help cook and prepare the meals, and on Thanksgiving, people are needed early to prepare the dinners for delivery.\n\nVolunteers are also needed to deliver meals within the county and help is needed for clean up afterwards.\n\nAs shown before, our area is one of the most giving in the region. All kinds of people volunteer for a number of great programs, giving time and money to help others a little less fortunate. Let\u2019s do what we can to make this important event happen. ...\n\nOnline: https://bit.ly/2QGOxof\n\n___\n\nNewsday on the challenges of a building an Amazon headquarters facility in Long Island.\n\nNov. 13\n\nAmazon\u2019s prime plan to deliver at least 25,000 jobs by locating a regional headquarters in Long Island City is exciting for its potential to dramatically change our region and overwhelming in its scope.\n\nThe tech giant\u2019s decision to situate one of two new headquarters on the edge of the East River in western Queens promises not only new jobs and revenue for the city and state, but also a broader economic impact that should ripple through New York City and onto Long Island. That includes more jobs in construction and development, and others in the supply chain that supports all of it. Amazon ultimately could add up to 40,000 jobs. That\u2019s more than Grumman Corp. ever had on the Island.\n\nLong Island will benefit, too. Some of Amazon\u2019s employees likely will live in the suburbs, boosting the region\u2019s economy and home values. Beyond that, tech companies often follow one another, growing as a cluster. Amazon\u2019s presence in Queens could certainly lead to other companies settling farther to the east.\n\nBut that hopeful picture is tempered by enormous challenges that must be addressed.\n\nWhile it makes sense to have Amazon\u2019s planning process go through the Empire State Development Corp., which handles large-scale projects, rather than be guided by New York City\u2019s land-use procedure, the community and its representatives must be heard and their concerns answered. That also requires political leaders and residents to get beyond a reflexive \u201cno.\u201d\n\nBut Amazon must meet the community partway. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio have provided the company with a lucrative package of tax breaks. They promise the city and state will take in $9 in revenue for every $1 in incentives they give away. But it\u2019s Amazon that must deliver on its grand promises.\n\nA mammoth concern is the infrastructure and transportation required for a large corporate campus. Long Island City is a nexus for eight city subway lines, two Long Island Rail Road stops, 13 bus routes, a ferry landing and roads that all seem to lead to the Ed Koch Queensboro Bridge. The promise of all that is what helped attract the folks from Seattle, but the subways are dilapidated and crowded, the roads are clogged, and neither LIRR station is a true commuter hub. Upgraded, expanded transit service is essential. That should include a new LIRR stop at Sunnyside Yards, a linchpin to connect the area to Grand Central Terminal once East Side Access is completed.\n\nLong Island City already has grown exponentially, and employees might choose to live and work in the area. The company\u2019s promises of a new school, a start-up tech company incubator, parks and other improvements are a good start. The pledge to put 50 percent of its payments in lieu of taxes directly toward the area\u2019s needs is critical.\n\nWe often talk of dreaming big and planning for the future. Bringing Amazon to Long Island City does both. But this big dream will need to be matched with reality.\n\nOnline: https://nwsdy.li/2DpYhzB\n\n___\n\nThe New York Times on the danger of laws against impious speech.\n\nNov. 13\n\nIt is good news that Pakistan\u2019s Supreme Court has acquitted and freed a Pakistani Christian woman who had already spent eight years on death row for blasphemy. In a 56-page ruling, the three justices said Asia Bibi, a farmworker in her early 50s, was the victim of mob justice aroused by unsubstantiated claims of what she said about the Prophet Muhammad in an exchange with women angry that she had sipped water from a cup used by Muslims.\n\nThough the trial was a farce, overturning it took courage. In 2011, the governor of Punjab Province, Salman Taseer, who had campaigned for Ms. Bibi\u2019s release and for changes in the blasphemy laws, was shot and killed by his bodyguard. Two months later, the minister of minorities, the sole Christian in the Pakistani government, who had also called for the changes, was killed. The announcement of the Supreme Court ruling on Oct. 31 set off protests across Pakistan and a warning from Islamist firebrands that the justices were risking death. Ms. Bibi has been in hiding since her release and may have to flee Pakistan.\n\nBut this is not a story about the triumph of tolerance over antiquated law. Ms. Bibi was freed not because the court found that the blasphemy law violated her rights or was in any other way inherently wrong, but because the trial was flawed. Blasphemy, broadly defined as speaking insultingly about God or religion, remains a capital crime in Pakistan and illegal in many other lands, in the East and the West.\n\nAccording to the Pew Research Center, about a quarter of all countries had anti-blasphemy laws or policies as of 2014, and more than a tenth have laws or policies against apostasy, or renouncing a religious belief. That does not mean people in the West risk being imprisoned for taking the Lord\u2019s name in vain. In many countries, like Canada, old laws remain on the books simply because nobody has bothered to get them off \u2014 as the Irish did last month when they voted in a referendum to scrap their blasphemy laws. In the United States, six states still have old blasphemy laws, but no case would conceivably survive against the First Amendment.\n\nThe few instances when blasphemy laws have been enforced in the West have arisen from attempts to police hostilities between religious communities. A Danish man, for example, was charged with blasphemy in February 2017 for posting a video showing him burning a Quran. Danish courts were no doubt mindful of the furor that erupted over the publication of cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad in 2005. (The Quran case was dropped after the blasphemy law was repealed in June 2017.)\n\nBlasphemy laws are most common, and most commonly enforced, in Muslim countries, and the penalties are often brutal. Ms. Bibi was sentenced to be hanged; Iran executed 20 people in 2015 for \u201cenmity against God,\u201d and in Saudi Arabia, adhering to the wrong branch of Islam can mean death.\n\nSacrilege is painful to religious believers everywhere. But broad and subjective legal proscriptions not only contradict the fundamental right to freedom of expression; they also open the door to persecution of minority faiths, as in Ms. Bibi\u2019s case, or of political dissidents. In Russia, the Pussy Riot band was imprisoned for \u201chooliganism motivated by religious hatred,\u201d though their target was not religion but Vladimir Putin.\n\nHistory supplies ample evidence that when religions proclaim themselves beyond criticism or challenge, there is hell to pay. Or, as the Anglican archbishop of New Zealand, Philip Richardson, said on learning to his surprise that his country had a \u201cblasphemy libel\u201d law, \u201cMy view is, God\u2019s bigger than needing to be defended by the Crimes Act.\u201d\n\nOnline: https://nyti.ms/2DHwxqM\n\n___", "FILE - In this Dec. 9, 2012, file photo, New Orleans Saints defensive end Will Smith appears before an NFL football game against the New York Giants in East Rutherford, N.J.

So would controlled burns, a proven, historic practice that has been neglected in recent decades.(Andreas Fuhrmann/The Record Searchlight via AP)\n\nBILLINGS, Montana (AP) \u2014 Creating fire buffers between housing and dry brush, burying spark-prone power lines and lighting more controlled burns to keep vegetation in check could give people a better chance of surviving wildfires, according to experts searching for ways to reduce growing death tolls from increasingly severe blazes in California and across the U.S. West.\n\nWestern wildfires have grown ever more lethal, a grim reality that\u2019s been driven by more housing developments sprawling into the most fire-prone grasslands and brushy canyons, experts say. Many of the ranchers and farmers who once managed those landscapes are gone, leaving neglected terrain that has grown thick with vegetation that can explode into flames when sparked.\n\nThat\u2019s left communities ripe for tragedy as whipping winds and recurring drought that\u2019s characteristic of climate change stoke wildfires like the ones still raging in Northern and Southern California that have killed at least 51 people in recent days.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people were told to leave their homes ahead of the blazes to get out of harm\u2019s way. Yet some experts say there\u2019s been an over-reliance on evacuation and too little attention paid to making communities safe, as well as not enough money for controlled burns and other preventive measures.\n\nSearch crews found many victims inside their vehicles, or just next to them, overcome by flames, heat and smoke as they tried to flee. Survivors of the blaze that nearly obliterated the Northern California town of Paradise and nearby communities spoke of having just minutes to escape and narrow roads made impassable by flames and traffic jams.\n\n\u201cThere are ... so many ways that can go wrong, in the warning, the modes of getting the message out, the confusion ... the traffic jams,\u201d said Max Moritz, a wildfire specialist with the University of California Cooperative Extension program.\n\nAs deadly urban wildfires become more common, officials should also consider establishing \u201clocal retreat zones, local safety zones\u201d in communities where residents can ride out the deadly firestorms if escape seems impossible, Moritz said.\n\nThat could be a community center, built or retrofitted to better withstand wildfires, which can exceed 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit, leaving little trace of ordinary homes.\n\nSuch fire protection measures in buildings can include sprinklers, fire- and heat-resistant walls and roofs, and barriers that keep sparks out of chimneys and other openings, according to the International Code Council, a nonprofit that helps develop building codes used widely in the United States.\n\nCreating more buffers \u2014 whether parks, golf courses or irrigated agriculture, like the vineyards that helped keep 2017 wildfires in California\u2019s wine country from spreading into even more towns \u2014 around new and old housing developments would help stave off wildfires threatening to overrun cities and towns.\n\nSo would burying electric power lines, which can spark and fail in the high winds that drive many of California\u2019s fiercest fires, said Jon Keeley, a research scientist with the U.S. Geological Survey in California.\n\nSparks from electrical utility equipment are suspects in the Northern California wildfire that consumed Paradise, destroying some 7,700 homes, and other deadly blazes in the state.\n\nA proven method to prevent wildfires from getting out of control is the use of controlled burns. By intentionally lighting fires, property owners or land managers can remove dead and low-lying trees and brush \u2014 material that otherwise accumulates and can accelerate the growth of fires.\n\nIn the mid-20th century, California ranchers burned hundreds of thousands of acres annually to manage their lands, said Lenya Quinn-Davidson, director of the Northern California Prescribed Fire Council.\n\nThat was phased out in the 1980s after California\u2019s fire management agency stepped in to take over the burns, and by the last decade, the amount of acreage being treated had dropped to less than 10,000 acres annually, Quinn-Davidson said.\n\nFormer agricultural land that rings many towns in the state became overgrown, even as housing developments pushed deeper into those rural areas. That was the situation in the Northern California town of Redding leading up to a fire that began in July and destroyed more than 1,000 homes. It was blamed for eight deaths.\n\n\u201cYou get these growing cities pushing out \u2014 housing developments going right up into brush and wooded areas. One ignition on a bad day, and all that is threatened,\u201d Quinn-Davidson said. \u201cThese fires are tragic, and they\u2019re telling us this is urgent. We can\u2019t sit on our hands.\u201d\n\nThe latest California fires have fueled debate over the reasons for ever-more deadly wildfires, with President Donald Trump claiming in a tweet Saturday that \u201cgross mismanagement of the forests\u201d was the sole reason the state\u2019s fires had become so \u201cmassive, deadly and costly.\u201d He also threatened to withhold federal payments to the state.\n\nHowever, most of California\u2019s deadly fires of recent years have been in grasslands and brushy chaparral, Keeley said.\n\n\u201cMost of the fires we\u2019ve been seeing in the last couple years that are the most destructive are not in the forest. Thinning isn\u2019t going to change anything,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump\u2019s assertion also ignored the huge federal land holdings in the state and brought a quick backlash, with the president of the California firefighters union describing it as a shameful attack on thousands of firefighters on the front lines.\n\nTo ease tensions, the White House sent Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke to tour fire-damaged areas and offer assistance to California Gov. Jerry Brown.\n\nIn an interview prior to the two-day visit, which began Wednesday, Zinke struck a conciliatory tone and said federal officials share blame for not managing public forest and rangelands aggressively enough.\n\n\u201cWe need to work in unison to make sure we thin the forest, especially fire breaks, and make sure we have prescribed burns,\u201d Zinke told The Associated Press. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lack of management on Interior lands, on U.S. Forest Service lands and certainly with state lands.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s California, not the Trump administration that is putting more money behind such efforts.\n\nIn response to the deadly blazes of recent years, California lawmakers in September approved a measure that would provide $1 billion over five years for fire protection, including more controlled burns and projects to thin forests and brush land.\n\nBy contrast, federal spending on hazardous fuels reduction has been flat in recent years, hovering just under $600 million, even as direct firefighting costs jumped to a record $2.9 billion last year.\n\nFor 2019, the Forest Service has proposed a $3 million bump for its wildfire fuels program. At Interior, Zinke proposed a $29 million cut in fuel management spending.\n\n___\n\nKnickmeyer reported from Washington.\n\n___\n\nFollow Matthew Brown on Twitter at https://twitter.com/MatthewBrownAP", "Click to copy\n\nClick to copy https://apnews.com/1aa4ff1cd09a4230b46b41cf5b4da5c7", "FILE - In this Jan. 14, 2018, file photo, Pittsburgh Steelers running back Le'Veon Bell (26) heads for the end zone after taking a pass from quarterback Ben Roethlisberger during the second half of an NFL divisional football AFC playoff game against the Jacksonville Jaguars, in Pittsburgh.

They said all the right things, stressed they understood the star running back was making a business decision by opting to stay home in hopes of protecting himself ahead of a potentially lucrative payday next spring.\n\nAnd they\u2019d welcome him with open arms whenever he returned.\n\nOn Wednesday, with Bell\u2019s absence for the rest of the season a certainty after he declined to sign his one-year, $14.5-million franchise tender , they exhaled.\n\nAnd pillaged.\n\nBell\u2019s teammates invaded his locker after practice, helping themselves to whatever they wanted \u2014 or at least whatever fit \u2014 with Bell\u2019s career in Pittsburgh all but over. It wasn\u2019t personal. Just business. A celebration of sorts to honor \u2014 they hope anyway \u2014 the last time they\u2019ll have to answer questions about Bell\u2019s unorthodox approach, one that included leaving his teammates in the dark about his plans.\n\n\u201cI think we all just assumed he\u2019d be here and it\u2019d be the same as the year before,\u201d guard David DeCastro said. \u201cIt amazes me in this day and age when you can tweet about things but you can\u2019t talk to each other. You\u2019re so connected, but you\u2019re disconnected at the same time. It\u2019s really interesting when you think about it from the big picture side of it. After that it is what it is, you stop worrying about it and you just move on.\u201d\n\nSomething the first-place Steelers (6-2-1) are more than happy to do. They take a five-game winning streak into Sunday\u2019s game at Jacksonville (3-6) looking for a bit of revenge against a team that beat them twice last season at Heinz Field, including a 45-42 stunner in the divisional round of the playoffs.\n\nBell finished with 157 total yards and two touchdowns in the loss. The Steelers cleaned out their lockers the following day, Bell among them. Despite saying he wanted to be a \u201cSteeler for life\u201d he never returned.\n\nBen Roethlisberger attempted to reach out to Bell, texting him before Tuesday\u2019s 4 p.m. deadline saying he hoped Bell would come in and sign. Bell never arrived and never responded to the quarterback he played alongside during the first five years of his career.\n\n\u201cHe was a great teammate here, a great football player,\u201d Roethlisberger said. \u201cTo each his own on what they want to walk away from.\u201d\n\nThe Steelers, meanwhile, will try to move forward without the versatile Bell, who played a vital role in the team\u2019s run of four straight playoff berths. Yet they have hardly missed a beat thanks to the rapid development of second-year back James Conner. The former Pitt star is second in the NFL in yards from scrimmage (1,158 yards) and his 10 rushing touchdowns are already one more than Bell ever put up in a single season.\n\nConner\u2019s success, however, also put him in an awkward position. He considers Bell a friend \u2014 and while Bell did otherwise stay silent on Tuesday he did share an Instagram story that appeared to show him promoting Conner to make the Pro Bowl \u2014 and never wanted to be put into an adversarial position against a mentor.\n\n\u201cI never really pay attention to it,\u201d James said. \u201cI always go by the model \u2018control what you can control,\u2019 so I\u2019m just going to keep doing what I\u2019ve been doing.\u201d\n\nThose concerns are gone now. While Bell will spend the next four months getting ready to hit free agency in hopes of landing a contract that would make him the highest-paid back in the NFL, Conner\u2019s goals are more immediate. He sat out the late portions of a 52-21 romp over Carolina last Thursday after being placed in the concussion protocol for the first time as a pro.\n\nConner admitted he felt \u201cdizzy\u201d initially, but was cleared to return to practice on Wednesday and should be fine to face the Jaguars.\n\n\u201cI feel good, feel like me again,\u201d Conner said. \u201cBack to normal.\u201d\n\nAnd his team again looks like the class of the AFC North. While Bell\u2019s absence caused a furor when he didn\u2019t come in before the regular season began \u2014 as he did in 2017 \u2014 things have died down considerably over the last month. Going unbeaten since the start of October helps. So does having Conner look like a Pro Bowler in his own right.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice that it\u2019s over,\u201d DeCastro said. \u201cI don\u2019t have to give (the media) clich\u00e9s, broken-record answers. We\u2019re just going to keep getting James some more yards and keep winning games. At the end of the day it\u2019s been fun.

She praised a cattle rancher at a Nov. 2 campaign event in Tupelo by saying: \u201cIf he invited me to a public hanging, I\u2019d be on the front row.\u201d\n\nMississippi has a history of racially motivated lynchings.\n\nDemocrat Mike Espy said Wednesday in Jackson that Hyde-Smith\u2019s comment was \u201churtful and harmful.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was hurtful to Mississippians of good will who know better,\u201d said Espy, who is seeking to become Mississippi\u2019s first black U.S. senator since Reconstruction. \u201cBut it was also harmful because it reinforced all these negative stereotypes \u2014 the stereotypes that I\u2019ve been working all my life to try to overcome.\u201d\n\nHyde-Smith, the first woman to represent Mississippi in either chamber of Congress, said in a statement Sunday that the hanging comment was an \u201cexaggerated expression of regard\u201d for a supporter and \u201cany attempt to turn this into a negative connotation is ridiculous.\u201d\n\nShe would not answer reporters\u2019 repeated questions about it Monday during a news conference at the Mississippi Republican Party headquarters.\n\n\u201cThat was curious what she said. But even more than that, after being asked six times to explain it, clarify, whatever, she didn\u2019t,\u201d said Espy, who spoke to reporters after appearing at a luncheon sponsored by a nonpartisan group called Working Together Jackson.\n\nHyde-Smith was also invited to the luncheon, but she was in Washington because the Senate is in session. Her campaign did not respond to Espy\u2019s criticism Wednesday.\n\nHyde-Smith and Espy are competing in a Nov. 27 runoff, and the winner will get the final two years of a six-year term started by Republican Thad Cochran.\n\nRepublican Gov. Phil Bryant appointed Hyde-Smith to temporarily succeed Cochran when the longtime lawmaker retired in April.\n\nDemocrats haven\u2019t won a U.S. Senate seat in Mississippi since 1982, and Republicans hold most statewide offices. Both national parties are putting money and effort into the special election. Hyde-Smith and Espy each received about 41 percent in a four-person field Nov. 6 to advance to the runoff.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has endorsed Hyde-Smith and traveled to Mississippi to campaign for her in October. A person with knowledge of White House thinking who is not authorized to speak publicly said Wednesday that the White House is looking at holding a rally in Mississippi before the runoff, but plans are still not definite.\n\nDemocratic U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris of California is scheduled to campaign for Espy on Saturday in Mississippi, Harris\u2019 spokeswoman said.\n\nIn the late 1960s, Espy and his twin sister, Michelle, were among the 17 black students who integrated what had been a white public high school in their hometown of Yazoo City.\n\n\u201cIt was W.E.B. Dubois that said the issue of the 20th century was the issue of the color line,\u201d Espy said Wednesday. \u201cSo, now it seems the issue of the 21st century is also the problem of the color line. I know here in Mississippi, we\u2019ve had these issues all of my life. I was (called) the N word in high school because my twin sister and I \u2014 we were 17 black students in a student body of 800.\u201d\n\nEspy in 1986 became Mississippi\u2019s first black U.S. House member since Reconstruction. In 1993 and 1994, he was U.S. agriculture secretary.\n\nSpeaking of Hyde-Smith\u2019s \u201cpublic hanging\u201d remark, Espy said some politicians think apologizing is a form of weakness.\n\n\u201cI really think it\u2019s a sign of strength,\u201d Espy said. \u201cI mean, nobody\u2019s perfect. Everyone makes mistakes. When you make mistakes, you\u2019ve got to own up to it, and you ought to say, \u2018I\u2019m sorry.\u2019\u201d\n\n____\n\nAssociated Press writer Catherine Lucey in Washington contributed to this report.

(AP) \u2014 With only weeks left in office, Gov. Jerry Brown named one of his senior advisers Wednesday to fill a long-running vacancy on the California Supreme Court.\n\nThe Democratic governor nominated Joshua Groban, 45, of Los Angeles, who has overseen Brown\u2019s appointment of about 600 judges since 2011. Brown said the appointments have been praised as the most diverse in state history.\n\nGroban is the fourth person Brown has named to the seven-member court. If confirmed, he would give the court a majority of Democratic appointees for the first time since voters rejected former Chief Justice Rose Bird and two other Brown appointees in 1986, during his first two terms as governor, said appellate lawyer David Ettinger, who writes a blog about the court.\n\nGroban \u201chas vast knowledge of the law and sound and practical judgment\u201d and will be a strong addition to California\u2019s highest court, Brown said in announcing his pick.\n\nGroban, a Democrat, would be paid $253,189 a year.\n\nBrown waited nearly two years to move to fill the vacancy created by the retirement of Justice Kathryn Mickle Werdegar.\n\n\u201cI am truly humbled by this nomination and, if confirmed, I look forward to working alongside the highest court\u2019s truly exemplary jurists,\u201d Groban said in a statement.\n\nThe nomination now goes to the State Bar\u2019s Commission on Judicial Nominees Evaluation and must be confirmed by the Commission on Judicial Appointments. Brown\u2019s office expects Groban to take the bench before the governor leaves office in January.\n\nGroban has four years before he would have to face voters for a retention decision. Justices serve 12-year terms.\n\nHe would be the court\u2019s first Jewish justice since 2001, though two other Jewish justices have served previously. Presiding Second District Court of Appeal Justice Arthur Gilbert said in a statement provided by the governor\u2019s office that the choice \u201creflects the diversity that makes our Supreme Court reflective of the society it serves.\u201d\n\nGroban would be the first white male justice on the highly diverse court since Justice Marvin Baxter left in 2015, Ettinger said. He called Groban a \u201cvery solid choice\u201d who influenced Brown\u2019s prior three \u201cexcellent appointments.\u201d Groban would become a colleague of those three judges.\n\nBrown previously appointed justices Goodwin Liu, Mariano-Florentino Cuellar and Leondra Kruger. Like Groban, none was a judge prior to being appointed.\n\nThe court issues most of its opinions as unanimous decisions, so there is unlikely to be a public divide between the court\u2019s Democratic and Republican blocs, Ettinger said, though Groban may influence which cases are selected for review.\n\nCourt of Appeal justices have been helping the high court while it was short-handed, but they have been included in majority decisions only twice since Werdegar left, he said. Chief Justice Tani Cantil-Sakauye has said the court delayed rulings in some cases where there was a three-three split.\n\nGroban also advised Brown on lawsuits and policy decisions involving education, the judiciary, criminal justice, national security and constitutional interpretation, the governor\u2019s office said.\n\nHe was legal counsel for Brown\u2019s gubernatorial campaign in 2010, a private attorney from 1999 to 2010, and a law clerk for U.S. District Judge William Conner in New York from 1998 to 1999.\n\nHe received his law degree from Harvard Law School.

We never thought, for example, that we were going to play in Israel or that we were going to be playing two years ago in the White House.\u201d\n\nMore than a dozen Latin artists honored the band with renditions of its greatest hits.

It has also promoted the Latino vote in the U.S. and has denounced what it deems as social injustices in countries such as Venezuela, Nicaragua and Bolivia.\n\nOlvera on Monday visited a temporary shelter in the Mexican state of Jalisco where members of a caravan of Central Americans attempting to reach the U.S. border were resting. He offered them words of encouragement and sang \u201cRayando el Sol\u201d y \u201cEl Muelle de San Blas.\u201d\n\n\u201cI went to see them. We\u2019ve been supporting the immigrants here in the United States for more than 20 years,\u201d Olvera said. \u201cAt the end of the day, we are brothers, we are human beings... We shouldn\u2019t be afraid of them... I told them be careful. I saw babies, I saw children. It was sad, but they have a lot of hope.\u201d\n\nGonz\u00e1lez added that the immigrants wouldn\u2019t be on this journey \u201cif there wasn\u2019t so much corruption in the countries they\u2019re coming from.\u201d\n\n\u201cNobody wants to leave their country,\u201d Gonz\u00e1lez said on the red carpet. \u201cThese people are running away from a lot of very drastic situations.

(AP Photo/John Amis)\n\nATLANTA (AP) \u2014 Flush with cash, the New York Yankees may take a run at Manny Machado.\n\nBut first, the slugging infielder would have some explaining to do.\n\nArriving in Atlanta for two days of owners meetings at a hotel next to the Braves\u2019 SunTrust Park, Hal Steinbrenner discussed the state of a team that has one of baseball\u2019s most dynamic young rosters but came up short in the playoffs the last two seasons.\n\nThe Yankees owner has plenty of money to spend after coming in under the luxury tax threshold last season for the first time since the penalty took effect in 2003. While the top priority is starting pitching, New York is also mentioned as a contender for one of the winter\u2019s biggest free-agent prizes.\n\nMachado is a dynamic player but comes with plenty of baggage, including the reputation as a dirty player and his admission that he\u2019s \u201dnot the type of player that\u2019s going to be Johnny Hustle \u201d after he jogged out a groundball during the NL Championship Series.\n\n\u201cCertainly, those comments are troubling,\u201d Steinbrenner said during a meeting with a small group of reporters in the hotel lobby. He quickly added that it would be the job of general manager Brian Cashman to determine whether the comments would disqualify the Yankees from pursuing such a player.\n\nNew York needs a shortstop for at least the first half of 2019 after Didi Gregorius blew out his throwing elbow in Game 2 of the AL Division series , leading to Tommy John reconstructive surgery.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re interested in any player, we sit down with them face to face with their agent and ask them, \u2018Where did this come from? What context was around the entire interview? What point were you trying to make? How do you justify it?\u2019\u201d Steinbrenner said. \u201cBecause that ain\u2019t going to sell where we play baseball.\u201d\n\nSteinbrenner also insisted many players with troubling reputations do just fine in New York.\n\n\u201cWe have a great clubhouse,\u201d the owner said. \u201cThey just don\u2019t put up with a lot of nonsense from players, whether it\u2019s a rookie just coming up or new players \u2014 even if they\u2019re veterans \u2014 coming in. That\u2019s a problem I\u2019m less worried about. But makeup is a big part of what we look at. It\u2019s not just analytics.\u201d\n\nMachado doesn\u2019t seem to be a priority. Mimicking Cashman\u2019s recent comments at the general manager meetings in California , Steinbrenner said the shaky starting pitching must be addressed.\n\nIn a 3-1 loss to the Red Sox in the ALDS , Masahiro Tanaka was the only starter to last five innings. J.A. Happ, Luis Severino and CC Sabathia each took a loss after combining to give up 14 earned runs in eight innings, an ERA of 15.75.\n\n\u201cWe have to add pieces,\u201d Steinbrenner said. \u201cOur starting pitching struggled in October. That was obvious. Tanaka was the only one who had good start in the Division Series, so we\u2019ve got work to do.\u201d\n\nSteinbrenner didn\u2019t rule out another huge contract. The Yankees already have Giancarlo Stanton , who is guaranteed $270 million over the next decade unless he opts out of the deal following the 2020 season. Machado is likely to seek an even bigger deal.\n\n\u201cWho is the person? How old are they? What are their abilities? What is their injury history? Do we really need that particular position?\u201d Steinbrenner said, describing how he would approach another megadeal. \u201cI\u2019m not against looking. We will leave no stone unturned.\u201d\n\nIn the end, the mantra is simple.\n\nWorld Series or Bust \u2014 especially after the rival Red Sox claimed the World Series championship.\n\n\u201cLook, our goal is to win the world championship, so it\u2019s going to hurt me no matter who it is,\u201d he said. \u201cBut clearly, having our biggest rival do it hurts more. Absolutely.\u201d\n\nOn other subjects:\n\n\u2014 Steinbrenner said he\u2019s hopeful his late father will be selected for the Hall of Fame. George Steinbrenner is among 10 candidates on the Today\u2019s Game Era ballot , which will surely set up plenty of debate over whether seven World Series titles and 11 AL pennants are enough to offset two lengthy suspensions from the game. \u201cI feel he deserves to be in, and a lot of other people do too,\u201d Hal Steinbrenner said. \u201cI think it\u2019s just a matter of time.\u201d\n\n\u2014 The Yankees owner declined to comment on his team\u2019s plans to buy back the 80 percent stake in the YES Network sold to 21st Century Fox from 2012-14. Steinbrenner did indicate new investors likely would own a majority stake in the network, while the team retained control over content and presentation. It had a similar arrangement with Fox.\n\n\u201cOur ownership would be in all likelihood in the same ballpark,\u201d he said. \u201cBut more important than how many points of equity we own, it\u2019s the ability to maintain control of the broadcast, the content, everything we always had, everything Fox was great at accepting.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Paul Newberry on Twitter at www.twitter.com/pnewberry1963 .

Until Lee came along, superheroes were more like Superman, who flew in to save the day and didn\u2019t seem to have problems like actual people.\n\nBut in 1962, Lee \u2014 then editor and head writer at Marvel Comics \u2014 saw the success of a new set of Marvel characters called the Fantastic Four, a team with super powers but ordinary faults such as jealousy and doubt. He then co-created Spider-Man, a teenage hero who wrestled not only with villains but also with typical teenage problems.\n\n\u201cYou ask the audience to suspend disbelief and accept that some idiot can climbs on walls,\u201d Lee said in a 1992 interview. \u201cBut once that\u2019s accepted, you ask ... would he still have to worry about dandruff. About acne, about getting girlfriends, about keeping a job?\u201d\n\nStan Lee led the revolution that made superheroes more human. And that helped the world of comics grow up.\n\nWith the characters now more complex and realistic, and more relatable to readers, the audience grew older and larger, as it is today. The conflicts of these new heroes were no longer just with other people in wild costumes. Often, the good guys fought conflicts within themselves. A famous Marvel story arc in 1979 unflinchingly showed Iron Man\u2019s struggle with alcoholism.\n\nBeing spawned in the turbulent 1960s, Lee\u2019s co-creations also confronted real-life social issues on its colorful comic pages. The X-Men\u2019s creation, with the bigotry they endured in their storylines, was said to have been inspired by the civil rights movement.\n\nThe characters almost immediately jumped off the pages of print and into animated cartoons \u2014 and then, after fits and starts, into television and film. When \u201cSpider-Man\u201d hit screens in 2002, that truly unleashed Marvel on the big screen, and many other films followed. Today, by one estimate, Marvel movies have grossed more than $24 billion worldwide.\n\nAlso, consider: Of the 10 current highest-grossing movies of all time, four of them are based on Marvel superheroes. Largely because of that, the heroes\u2019 images and influence have crept into virtually every level of modern pop culture. They seem to be everywhere.\n\nAnd it all started with Stan Lee.\n\nThat\u2019s not his real name, you know.\n\nHe was born Stanley Lieber, in New York City. He aspired to become a famous writer and author of the next \u201cGreat American Novel.\u201d When he worked as an office boy for a comic-book publisher, others noticed his knack for writing and editing, and he began scripting stories. But he was embarrassed to use his real name with his comic-book work because he still held higher literary aspirations.\n\nSo, like a hero adopting a secret identity, he became Stan Lee.\n\nAnd in a way, he became perhaps the mightiest comic-book hero of them all.\n\nOnline: https://www.augustachronicle.com/\n\n___\n\nNov. 12\n\nThe Savannah Morning News on control of political parties:\n\nAs one election cycle ends, another begins.\n\nThe priority for 2020 won\u2019t be to identify the candidates for president or craft strategies to swing congressional districts. The most significant - and ultimately important - tussle will be for the souls of the Democratic and Republican parties.\n\nThe two parties once set the standard for shared governing. But what were once wings or factions of ideologues inside the parties have grown in influence. By 2020, if trends hold, those zealots will have fully taken over the parties. Whatever you call them \u2014 pick your label: \u201cprogressive liberals\u201d or \u201csocialists\u201d on the left and \u201cpopulists\u201d and \u201cnationalists\u201d on the right - they have come to dominate the only two political parties that matter in America.\n\nAs the parties drift apart during this evolution, they share several ugly commonalities. They disagree the same way - uncivilly. They refuse to search out shared interests in crafting policy and legislation. They socialize only among their own.\n\nIt\u2019s us versus them, and both sides have lost a must-have perspective: that while they were elected by a majority of their constituents, they represent the interests of all.\n\nMeanwhile, fanatical citizens harass and accost officials in public - and make certain to record and share these exchanges on social media.\n\nMany have long wondered why successful professionals go into public service and take on the headaches that come with the job. Never have the drawbacks been more pronounced, and the toxic environment can\u2019t help but affect even the most earnest among our leaders.\n\nSome get angry and feed the divisiveness. Others simply quit, fed up with the rancor.\n\nIt\u2019s no coincidence that 57 senators and representatives did not seek re-election to their current seats last week, and 34 of them - including 26 Republicans \u2014 are leaving politics completely. That\u2019s the most since 1974.\n\nCandidates who ran and won as hyper-partisans filled the void, for the most part. The divide broadens, and the rhetoric is sure to grow in intensity.\n\nMake quiet voices heard\n\nA correction is in order, and the early focus on the 2020 election provides opportunity.\n\nWhat form that revision takes is the mystery. Will the more moderate and pragmatic among us work to take back the parties? Or will they cede the parties to the zealots and finally form a viable third party, with deep-pocketed donors and recognizable leaders more interested in governing than dominating?\n\nHere\u2019s a better question: What\u2019s it going to take to spark such movements?\n\nFor all the fervor surrounding the elections, tens of millions of Americans remain disengaged in the political process. Their focus is on earning a living, raising families, enjoying the weekends. Pressed on the reason for such apathy, many will give you some version of the \u201cSerenity Prayer,\u201d which starts, \u201cGod grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change.\u201d\n\nSuch thinking is defeatist, but it is their reality. As the parties become less and less representative, more and more Americans become disillusioned. Their own party embraces ideals they find distasteful, if not repugnant. Meanwhile, they can\u2019t look to the other party for salvation, as it has become centered on similarly objectionable ideology.\n\nThe time has come to band together to make a difference, for the quiet to make their voices heard. The current politicization is reversible but requires a steadfast commitment, because now that the extremists have secured a foothold, they will fight to keep from being marginalized again.\n\nCampaign 2020 is underway. Shape it before it shapes you.\n\nOnline: https://www.savannahnow.com/\n\n___\n\nNov. 13\n\nValdosta Daily Times on the pecan industry:\n\nBelieve it or not, the pecan has its own month.\n\nNovember is Georgia Pecan Month and our region is the epicenter of the pecan industry.\n\nSouth Georgia boasts the best producers and processors in the world, and pecans are a major boon to our economy.\n\nHurricane Michael wrecked many pecan trees, which take an entire decade to mature and begin producing nuts.

Look for plump pecans that are uniform in color and size.\n\n. The shell of a pecan should be smooth and light brown.\n\n. Pecans are perishable and must be properly stored to maintain optimum quality.\n\nPecans are used in dips, dressings, sauces, salads and desserts, including the ever-popular pecan pie.\n\nWe think the best way to eat a pecan is simply to crack it open and enjoy.\n\nHere are some interesting pecan facts from the Georgia Department of Agriculture:\n\n. Early settlers exchanged pecans for trinkets and tools.\n\n. Thomas Jefferson planted pecan trees around Monticello.\n\n. By 1871, several large pecan groves had been planted in most of the southeastern United States, including Georgia.\n\n. Georgia\u2019s commercial pecan production began during the late 1800s.\n\n. By 1948, Georgia\u2019s pecan production reached 40 million pounds.\n\n.

(AP Photo/Matt Rourke)\n\nPHILADELPHIA (AP) \u2014 The Philadelphia Eagles are closer to being the eighth defending Super Bowl champion to follow up with a losing record than becoming the ninth team to repeat.\n\nA season that began with promise has been a major disappointment. The offense is inconsistent, the defense has wasted several leads in the second half, and a slew of injuries has left the team short-handed in key areas.\n\nStill, the Eagles (4-5) are in the mix in a mediocre NFC East.\n\n\u201cThere is a level of frustration, but listen, we\u2019re very close,\u201d coach Doug Pederson said Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019re so close in a lot of areas. You look at our output and production offensively, we\u2019re very similar to where we were last year.\n\n\u201cThe difference is creating turnovers on defense and then scoring in the red zone. That\u2019s kind of what\u2019s staring at us right in the face. We have to finish better, and we have to score more points.\u201d\n\nThe Eagles have lost three straight games at home, including 27-20 to the Cowboys (4-5).

Some of the Marie Antoinette jewelry hadn\u2019t been seen in public for 200 years \u2014 until now.\n\nLike many of the 10 former Marie Antoinette pieces up for sale, the pendant obliterated the pre-auction estimate \u2014 in its case, $1 million to $2 million. It sold for a hammer price of 32 million Swiss francs ($32 million), but with the buyer\u2019s premium and fees, the total sale rose to more than $36.1 million.\n\nThe buyer wanted to remain anonymous, the auction house said.\n\nAll told, the Marie Antoinette pieces reaped nearly $43 million.\n\nThe diamond and pearl jewelry of Marie Antoinette that went under the hammer epitomized the aloof, pre-Revolutionary opulence of French royals brought down by the uprising. The wife of King Louis XVI, she was executed in France\u2019s revolutionary fervor in 1793.\n\nBefore falling to the guillotine, she had secretly smuggled abroad some of her most treasured possessions to her relatives amid rising the revolutionary fervor that ultimately marked the beginning of the end of France\u2019s centuries-old monarchy.\n\n\u201cThe Marie Antoinette pendant is simply irreplaceable,\u201d Eddie LeVian, CEO of jewelers Le Vian, said before the sale. \u201cThis is about far more than the gems themselves: Marie Antoinette\u2019s jewelry is inextricably linked to the cause of the French Revolution.\u201d\n\nThe queen\u2019s jewelry also included a set of pearl and diamond earrings, a diamond brooch, and a natural pearl and diamond necklace. A monogrammed, diamond-set ring bears a lock of Marie Antoinette\u2019s hair.\n\nNearly all of those lots far outstripped the pre-sale estimates, a testament to the difficulty in assessing the value of such rarely available jewels.\n\n\u201cIt was really the Bourbon-Parma factor, plus certainly the Marie Antoinette factor,\u201d said Daniela Mascetti, Sotheby\u2019s chairman for jewelry in Europe. \u201cPrices really rocketed.

EU ambassadors met in Brussels Wednesday, in a closed door session, to discuss the draft agreement. (AP Photo/Virginia Mayo)\n\nLONDON (AP) \u2014 The draft divorce agreement between Britain and the European Union has two parts: a legally binding withdrawal agreement, which runs more than 580 pages, and a looser political declaration on future relations.\n\nSome key points:\n\nWITHDRAWAL AGREEMENT\n\nTransition period: Britain will leave the EU on March 29 but remain inside the bloc\u2019s single market and bound by its rules until the end of December 2020, while the two sides work out a new trade relationship. The transition period can be extended by joint agreement before July 1, 2020 if both parties decide more time is needed.\n\nIrish border: The deal commits the two sides to a \u201cbackstop\u201d solution to guarantee the border between EU member Ireland and the U.K.\u2019s Northern Ireland remains free of customs posts or other obstacles. It keeps the U.K. in a customs arrangement with the EU, and will last until superseded by permanent new trade arrangements. Both sides say they hope to have a new deal in place by the end of 2020, so the backstop is never needed.\n\nDivorce bill: Britain agrees to cover contributions to staff pensions and commitments to EU programs the U.K. made while a member for the funding period that runs to 2020. The bill has previously been estimated at about 39 billion pounds ($50 billion).\n\nCitizens\u2019 Rights: EU citizens living in Britain, and Britons elsewhere in the bloc, will continue to have the rights to live and work that they do now.\n\nPOLITICAL DECLARATION\n\nThe seven-page political declaration says Britain and the EU will seek a \u201cfree trade area combining deep regulatory and customs cooperation,\u201d and \u201cambitious, comprehensive and balanced\u201d arrangements for the services sector.\n\nOther ambitions include visa-free travel for short-term visits, smooth rail road, air and sea transport and \u201ccomprehensive, close, balanced and reciprocal law enforcement and judicial cooperation.\u201d\n\nDetails will be worked out after the U.K. leaves the EU on March 29.", "GREENBELT, Md.

(AP) \u2014 California\u2019s budget is in \u201cremarkably good shape\u201d as fiscally conservative Gov. Jerry Brown prepares to hand off to governor-elect and fellow Democrat Gavin Newsom, the state\u2019s legislative analyst said Wednesday.\n\nNewsom and the Legislature will have nearly $15 billion to allocate next year, the analyst said, but it warns that the state might face budget cuts during any future recession if lawmakers don\u2019t commit that entire surplus to California\u2019s rainy day funds.\n\n\u201cIt is difficult to overstate how good the budget\u2019s condition is today,\u201d said Mac Taylor, an appointee of the Legislature who wrote the analysis. \u201cBy historical standards, this surplus is extraordinary.\u201d\n\nThe analyst\u2019s longer-term outlook also is rosy, projecting annual surpluses averaging more than $4 billion annually if the economy continues to grow.\n\nLawmakers need to be prudent but still spend some of the money in areas that will improve people\u2019s lives, said Assemblyman Phil Ting, D-San Francisco, the Assembly\u2019s budget chairman.\n\n\u201cI think when people see we have all this revenue, their first reaction is we want to spend it all,\u201d Ting said. \u201cOur fiscal situation is very strong in California, but we also have a recession looming \u2014 we just don\u2019t know when it\u2019s coming.\u201d\n\nBrown has warned of an inevitable economic downturn for years as he blocked legislative spending. Newsom has said he also will be fiscally cautious, but has advocated expensive programs including providing universal health care, preschool for every child, creating jobs and stemming homelessness.\n\nNewsom did not immediately comment on the forecast, which comes as his transition team begins crafting the budget he will recommend to lawmakers in January.\n\nDemocratic Senate President Pro Tem Toni Atkins of San Diego said that Brown and lawmakers \u201chave pulled the state from the depths of the Great Recession\u201d while building reserves and increasing spending in critical areas while Brown has been governor.\n\nShe promised a responsible budget \u201cwhile also making strong new investments in our schools, universities, infrastructure, environmental-protection efforts and poverty reduction programs.\u201d", "The weekly fishing report as compiled for the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department for Nov. 14 and also available on the internet at http://www.txfishing.com :\n\nCENTRAL\n\nAUSTIN: Water stained; 65-71 degrees; 0.5 feet low.

(AP) \u2014 Joey Bosa could possibly make his season debut Sunday.\n\nThe Los Angeles Chargers defensive end, who has been out with a foot injury, practiced Wednesday. Coach Anthony Lynn said he was excited to see Bosa practicing with his teammates for the first time since Sept. 5.\n\nBosa did individual drills during the portion of practice open to reporters and was listed as limited on the team\u2019s practice report. Lynn has continued to stress caution about when Bosa could return, but acknowledged he could play against Denver depending on how well the third-year lineman does in individual and team drills.\n\n\u201cHe hasn\u2019t played football in 13-14 weeks, whatever it is. So we have to be careful putting him back in,\u201d Lynn said.\n\nBosa first injured his foot during training camp, which caused him to miss the preseason. He reinjured it during practice leading up to the opener against Kansas City. Bosa said two weeks ago that he should not have rushed in trying to get back for the first week.\n\nIsaac Rochell, who started three games at defensive end, said Bosa has been a big presence in team meetings even though he hasn\u2019t played.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s super engaged. He\u2019s been locked in at all times. He has been going through scouting reports and the game plan,\u201d Rochell said.\n\nThe Chargers are 7-2 and have won six straight despite Bosa\u2019s absence.

Bosa has 23 sacks in two seasons, including an NFL-record 19 in his first 20 games.\n\nBosa\u2019s return this week could help bolster a unit that is down two starters at linebacker after Denzel Perryman was placed on injured reserve due to a knee injury. Denver is 3-6 but is ranked 11th in the league in offense.\n\n\u201cIt has been tough seeing him go through the rehab and everything,\u201d Rochell said about Bosa. \u201cWith him coming back, I think it will add a lot.

(AP) \u2014 North Carolina Republican legislators intensifying their review of a $58 million side agreement between Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper and utilities building the Atlantic Coast Pipeline agreed Wednesday to hire an outside investigator and demand government records.\n\nA GOP-controlled oversight committee voted to expand an examination of the January memorandum of understanding after lawmakers said they\u2019ve been rebuffed repeatedly by the Cooper administration in their questions and document requests. Committee members also suggested subpoenas might become necessary later.\n\n\u201cI promise you this committee will get to the bottom of this,\u201d GOP Sen. Harry Brown of Jacksonville, a panel co-chairman.\n\nUnder Cooper\u2019s January memorandum , builders of the three-state natural gas pipeline were to give money that he would disburse for environmental mitigation, economic development and renewable energy projects. The memorandum and approval of a key state regulatory permit were announced separately the same day.\n\nBy February, the General Assembly had passed a law essentially intercepting the money, whenever it\u2019s paid, and giving it instead to public schools in eastern counties along the pipeline route. Republicans said the General Assembly \u2014 not Cooper \u2014 decides how state funds are spent.\n\nCooper and the state Department of Environmental Quality have said repeatedly that the agreement wasn\u2019t connected to the state regulatory permits for the pipeline. Cooper said the $58 million would have been distributed based on rules preventing conflicts of interest.\n\nCooper\u2019s office dismissed the investigation\u2019s ramp-up as politically motivated. The administration has blasted GOP lawmakers for previous hearings in which they either pummeled administration officials with questions or prevented them from answering.\n\nNo one spoke for Cooper at Wednesday\u2019s meeting because no one was invited, spokesman Ford Porter said. Senate Republicans said DEQ Secretary Michael Regan had been invited, but an agency spokeswoman said DEQ wasn\u2019t invited to make a presentation.\n\n\u201cRepublican leaders staged another bizarre kangaroo court to score political points,\u201d Porter wrote in an email. \u201cThe fact remains that legislative Republicans hurt eastern North Carolina when they chose for political reasons to raid an economic development fund that would create jobs.\u201d\n\nRepublican lawmakers said what they call the governor\u2019s stonewalling on their requests is only reinforcing their concern that the agreement was illegal and permits conditional on the side agreement. The investigator hasn\u2019t yet been named.\n\n\u201cThe governor\u2019s lack of transparency obviously makes matters worse,\u201d said Sen. Paul Newton, a Cabarrus County Republican and former executive at Duke Energy, one of the utilities in the pipeline consortium. \u201cThere may be a perfectly reasonable explanation for all of the things I\u2019m about to discuss, but we won\u2019t know that until we\u2019ve conducted additional research and receive our much sought-after answers from the governor.\u201d\n\nIn particular, Newton wanted more information about a letter dated last January that the Department of Environmental Quality had drafted denying a key permit. A media report had quoted a Cooper adviser saying it was clear last December that DEQ would approve a key permit.\n\nWhile some Democrats on the panel voted against hiring an outside investigator, citing costs, they also weren\u2019t entirely opposed to getting more details from Cooper\u2019s administration.\n\n\u201cI think we should have information provided that would clarify ambiguity,\u201d said Sen. Floyd McKissick, a Durham County Democrat, adding he expects it will show nothing improper occurred. McKissick said the confrontational manner in which Republican lawmakers scrutinized the deal hasn\u2019t encouraged cooperation: \u201cHopefully we can build that mutual trust moving forward so that we can get some answers.\u201d\n\nConstruction of the 600-mile pipeline has started in North Carolina and West Virginia.

Anglin published the phone numbers, email addresses and social media profiles of Gersh, her husband and 12-year-old son and wrote, \u201cAre y\u2019all ready for an old fashioned troll storm?\u201d\n\nGersh said her family received more than 700 threatening and harassing messages, many of them anti-Semitic, online and by phone and mail.\n\nAnglin argued that the First Amendment protects his speech and that he can\u2019t be held liable for his followers\u2019 actions. Gersh\u2019s attorneys responded that the First Amendment was never meant to protect a campaign that aimed to destroy people\u2019s lives.\n\nChristensen said Anglin\u2019s speech against Gersh appeared to be a matter of private concern, not public concern, and that opens him to more regulation.\n\nAnglin\u2019s alleged attacks against Gersh didn\u2019t inform the public about a matter of public concern, the judge said in his ruling. Rather, based on the allegations, Anglin appears to have roused his readers\u2019 political sympathies by drawing on their hatred and fear of Jews to advance his personal campaign against Gersh, who is not a public figure, Christensen wrote.\n\n\u201cAnglin did not use his speech about Gersh to raise awareness for issues consonant with the alt-right agenda,\u201d the judge wrote in his decision. \u201cRather, construing the allegations in the complaint as true, Anglin exploited the prejudices widely held among his readers to specifically target one individual.\u201d\n\nDavid Dinielli, the deputy legal director for the Southern Poverty Law Center, which is representing Gersh, said Christensen\u2019s decision upholds a recommendation by a magistrate judge.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s ruling underscores what both we and our client have said from the beginning of this case \u2014 that online campaigns of hate, threats, and intimidation have no place in a civil society, and enjoy no protection under our Constitution,\u201d Dinielli said in a statement.\n\nAnglin attorney Marc Randazza did not immediately respond to an email or text message seeking comment.\n\nChristensen also upheld U.S. Magistrate Judge Jeremiah Lynch recommendation that Anglin can be held liable for his readers\u2019 conduct.", "The Latest: Senate fails on withdrawal from Crosscheck\n\nSPRINGFIELD, Ill.

Easley, File)\n\nFRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) \u2014 A former college basketball player who has spent more than three decades in the Kentucky legislature announced Wednesday that he will run for governor in 2019, hoping his moderate views will convince rural voters to return to the Democratic party ahead of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nRocky Adkins, the minority floor leader of the Kentucky House of Representatives, disclosed his plans in Morehead, an eastern Kentucky city where he played for the Morehead State University basketball team in the early 1980s. The campaign rollout comes one week after Democrats were drubbed at the polls in Kentucky, with Republicans maintaining large majorities in the state House and Senate while fending off a fierce challenge in a central Kentucky Congressional district.\n\nDemocrats slowly lost rural Kentucky voters over the decades as Republicans tied them to the national Democratic party on issues like abortion and immigration. Elliott County, where Adkins is from, voted for Donald Trump in 2016, the first time in its 147-year history it had ever voted for a Republican presidential candidate.\n\nYet in that same year, Elliott County voters also re-elected Adkins to the state legislature with 66 percent of the vote.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a very moderate, middle of the road, common sense Democrat,\u201d Adkins, 59, said in an interview. \u201cI think I can win those voters back. I\u2019m the kind of Democrat they can be for, and I think I\u2019m the kind of Democrat they will be for.\u201d\n\nKentucky is one of three states that will elect a governor in 2019. Republican Gov. Matt Bevin announced in August he would seek a second term, but has not yet filed for the office or begun raising money for a 2019 campaign.\n\nDemocrats think he is vulnerable because of his low approval ratings after he criticized public employees who opposed his changes to the public pension system.\n\nDemocrat Attorney General Andy Beshear announced his campaign in July and has already raised more than $660,000. Other high-profile potential candidates include Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes, former Auditor Adam Edelen, Louisville state Rep. Attica Scott and Amy McGrath, a retired fighter pilot who just raised nearly $8 million and narrowly lost to Republican U.S. Rep. Andy Barr in Kentucky\u2019s 6th Congressional district.\n\n\u201cThere is no question that Gov. Bevin can be beat,\u201d Adkins said. \u201cHis approval rating is in the tank.\u201d\n\nIn the legislature, Adkins has voted for a ban on abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. He has supported labor unions by voting against laws that would ban mandatory union dues. When Democrats still controlled the House, Adkins was the floor leader for 13 years, responsible for calling legislation for a vote. But during that time, the legislature consistently did not pay the full contribution to the state\u2019s retirement systems, contributing to crippling debts that have them dangerously close to insolvency.\n\n\u201cWhile Rocky Adkins spent his career voting for record underfunding of the teacher\u2019s pension system by nearly $3 billion, Gov. Bevin has been setting new records for Kentucky \u2014 record business development, record low unemployment, record pension funding, and record investment in education and workforce development,\u201d said Blake Brickman, Bevin\u2019s chief of staff.\n\nAdkins said lawmakers from both parties approved the funding requests of previous governors. He also noted that Republicans controlled the state Senate for much of that time.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to be a Monday morning quarterback,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve fought hard for public pensions to remain in place to protect the promises that have been made to our teachers and public employees.\u201d\n\nAdkins taught high school after his college basketball career ended in the first round of the 1983 NCAA tournament. He was elected to the state House of Representatives at age 26 in 1986.\n\nKentucky politicians typically sympathize with laid-off coal industry workers. But Adkins sees himself as one of those workers. In the early 2000s, he lost his job at Addington Enterprises, a coal company where he worked in the quality control division.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m qualified to talk about that downturn in the coal economy, I\u2019ve experienced it, my family experienced it,\u201d he said.\n\nAdkins started his own company RJA Enterprises, which he described as doing \u201cproject development work for companies in the energy field.\u201d He said he has never done business with Kentucky state government.\n\nAdkin\u2019s running mate is Stephanie Horne, real estate attorney and Jefferson County Board of Education member. Adkins said he chose her because of her \u201ckeen understanding of public education,\u201d which he said \u201cwill be a top priority of our administration.\u201d", "A tour bus is towed away Wednesday, Nov. 14, 2018, after it overturned on an icy highway in northern Mississippi.

(AP Photo/Christian Palma)\n\nMEXICO CITY (AP) \u2014 The NFL\u2019s decision to move the regular-season game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Los Angeles Rams due to the poor condition of the turf at Azteca Stadium has left many Mexicans disappointed, angered and wondering how it will affect the relationship with the league for the future.\n\nAfter consulting with the players association and local officials, the NFL determined the conditions of the historic venue did not meet the standards for playability and moved the game back to the Los Angeles Coliseum. The Rams (9-1) and the Chiefs (9-1) will face off Monday night in a much-anticipated game between the top two teams in each conference.\n\nBased solely on the teams\u2019 records, the game was going to be the best matchup ever played outside the United States.\n\nBut Mexico blew it.\n\n\u201cColossal shame\u201d was the headline of the sports newspaper Record. \u201cThe league takes away the best game of the season due to the lousy state of the field that Estadio Azteca was not able to fix. The NFL has left, and its return is in jeopardy.\u201d\n\nAzteca officials changed the playing surface from natural grass to a hybrid in May, but the turf hasn\u2019t been ideal for several months due to its intense use. Since July 21, America and Cruz Azul, the two Liga MX teams that share the stadium, have played 23 games between them in the stadium, and the women\u2019s professional team from America has played another seven games there.\n\nThe stadium also hosted two concerts by Colombian singer Shakira on Oct. 11 and 12, and another one from music channel Telehit on Nov. 7 that left the field in its worst condition in years.\n\n\u201cI feel devastated, angered and ashamed, all of that together,\u201d said former NFL kicker Raul Allegre, who is Mexican and works as an analyst for ESPN Deportes. \u201cI\u2019m still trying to figure out how small minds were so irresponsible in the preparations for a game of this magnitude. I know that the world does not revolve around the NFL, but this is a great event not only for the sport but for the country, and it is inconceivable how it was taken so lightly.\u201d\n\nAccording to an NFL study released last year, the game between the Oakland Raiders and the Houston Texans played in 2016 generated a $45 million impact on the local economy. The Mexican government said that last year*s game between the Raiders and the New England Patriots topped that number.\n\n\u201cOur fans in Mexico are among the most passionate, dedicated NFL fans anywhere in the world,\u201d said Mark Waller, the league\u2019s executive vice president of International who will be in Mexico City on Thursday to discuss next year and what needs to occur at Azteca to keep the NFL interested in playing there. \u201cWe will continue to look for ways to bring them closer to the NFL in the days and weeks ahead. We share the disappointment of not being able to play this game as planned in Mexico City.\u201d\n\nThe game is usually scheduled on the third weekend of November, when Mexicans celebrate the Revolution*s anniversary, and the authorities organize additional activities in order to entice fans to spend the whole weekend in the capital. For this year\u2019s game, the fanfest that drew more than 300,000 fans in Chapultepec Park was moved to the Zocalo, the country\u2019s main square located in downtown Mexico City, in an attempt to draw even more fans. The NFL office in Mexico and the Sports Institute of Mexico City also scheduled a 5k and 10k race for Sunday.\n\nLocal authorities have not said whether both events will continue.\n\n\u201cWe have to learn from this experience so it won\u2019t happen again in the future\u201d, said Horacio De la Vega, director of the sports institute in Mexico City. \u201cEveryone needs to assume their own responsibility in this. I think that the crew that takes care of the field in Azteca should have put more attention in such a big issue as the playing field is, and that did not happen.\u201d\n\nMany fans are also angered because they already paid airfares and hotel fees that are probably lost.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very upset because I already purchased my plane tickets and they canceled the game at the last minute. They promised to reimburse my money for the game ticket, but what about the other expenses, who is going to be held accountable for that?\u201d said Victor Reynoso, a Rams fan who was planning to come to the capital from the northern city of Monterrey.\n\nReynoso is probably not alone, according to Mexico\u2019s Tourism Secretary; around 30,000 fans come to the city for the weekend of the game.\n\nThe federal government, through the Tourism Secretary, pays the NFL $14.5 million for each game. Last year, the NFL and Televisa, which owns Estadio Azteca, announced that they signed an extension to bring back games until the 2021 season.\n\nBut it\u2019s uncertain what is going to happen after Televisa failed to present a field up to the standards for an NFL game. Several NFL owners are wary of further games at Azteca because of this situation, and the league is still keen on playing games in Mexico, but might be ready to consider other venues there. Monterrey and Guadalajara have stadiums capable of hosting NFL games, and both cities will be hosting games in the 2026 World Cup, though the NFL has believed Azteca is the best option.\n\n___\n\nAP Pro Football Writer Barry Wilner contributed.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Michaela Onyenwere was everywhere in the fourth quarter for UCLA.\n\nShe scored 11 of her 25 points in the final period, when the Bruins ended the game on an 18-4 run to upset No. 14 Georgia 80-69 on Wednesday.\n\nThe 5-foot-11 forward also hauled down a team-high 11 rebounds, helping UCLA to a 31-30 edge on the boards.\n\n\u201cShe plays like she\u2019s 6-5,\u201d Georgia coach Joni Taylor said. \u201cShe\u2019s aggressively posting, she rebounds.

(AP Photo/Charlie Riedel, File)\n\nDoes anyone really want to host the Winter Olympics? Residents in Calgary answered that question with a resounding \u201cNo,\u201d and now the International Olympic Committee has some soul-searching to do. Again.\n\nAfter being rejected in yet another public vote, the IOC is down to two candidates to host the 2026 Games \u2014 Stockholm, Sweden, and a joint Italian bid from Milan and Cortina D\u2019Ampezzo. Both of those bidders also have issues , and organizers are scrambling to hand the next available Winter Games to one of them before either bid gets derailed. They will award the Games next June.\n\nIf either of those candidates work out, it will be a victory in that Sweden or Italy will break a string of three straight Winter Games in Asia, two of which \u2014 Sochi (2014) and Beijing (2022) \u2014 have been run by authoritarian governments that didn\u2019t have to answer to the public for the money they spent to host.\n\nBut that\u2019s not to say Western democracies are falling back in love with the movement. Despite the IOC\u2019s attempts to streamline the bidding process and control the costs of the Games, no fewer than eight Western cities and countries have rejected the idea \u2014 either through elections or government action \u2014 of bankrolling what is increasingly viewed as a bloated, expensive sports festival with little upside for the city that takes them on.\n\n\u201cI think Calgary is another example of a democracy, more specifically, voters in a democracy, deciding that the hosting of the Olympic Games is just not in their best interest \u2014 and they have other things to focus on,\u201d said Chris Dempsey, who spearheaded Boston\u2019s opposition to hosting the 2024 Games.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at some of people, places and things in the bidding game, and where they stand after Tuesday\u2019s vote:\n\nITALY \u2014 The nation\u2019s federal government has vowed not to pay a penny after Turin was removed from this multi-city bid. It means regional governments will foot the brunt of the bill. Rome has bailed on two previous bids for the Summer Games, most recently in 2024, which certainly isn\u2019t a comforting thought for the IOC.\n\nSTOCKHOLM \u2014 Only three days after the IOC put the Swedish capital on its short list of finalists, a newly formed government in the city announced it would not provide funding to host the Games. Negotiations are ongoing.\n\nSALT LAKE CITY \u2014 They have kept venues intact and, in many cases, improved on them, and there is no significant public opposition. To sum it up, the 2002 hosts could probably hold another Olympics in a few months , if pressed. IOC President Thomas Bach would be wise to award them 2030 right now \u2014 that is, only if they don\u2019t want 2026.\n\nDENVER \u2014 The only city to be awarded the Olympics, for 1976, only to turn around and reject them, is officially in the running to be the U.S. candidate for 2030. But it\u2019s not much of a contest. Not helping matters: Colorado\u2019s incoming governor, Jared Polis, recently channeled his inner Richard Lamm \u2014 the then-governor-to-be who led the opposition in the 1970s \u2014 calling the Olympics \u201cfun things for millionaires and business people\u201d that leave others paying the bill.\n\nTHOMAS BACH \u2014 The president of the IOC looks more brilliant by the day for his decision to award two Summer Games \u2014 2024 to Paris and 2028 to Los Angeles \u2014 in one shot at last year\u2019s IOC meeting. Acknowledging there were \u201ctoo many losers\u201d in the bidding game, he took the only two suitors he had left for the more-expensive, more-grandiose Summer Games and gave them both a victory. He might consider a two-for-one approach on the Winter side, as well.\n\nCASEY WASSERMAN \u2014 Bach might be the president, but it would be difficult to find someone who wields more power in the movement than the head of the LA 2028 organizing committee. He\u2019s had a major role in shaping the new U.S. Olympic Committee, signing off on the hiring of the new CEO and CFO. Because he agreed to take the consolation prize, 2028, in what began as a contest for the 2024 Summer Games, he brokered an advantageous marketing deal with the USOC. And his blessing \u2014 and only his blessing \u2014 would be crucial to pushing Salt Lake City into the 2026 slot \u2014 a move that is currently untenable because of how it would impact the LA marketing arrangement.\n\nROTATING CITIES \u2014 The fantastical notion of rotating Olympics between three or four cities \u2014 say Sydney, London and Beijing on the Summer side, and Salt Lake City, Sochi and Vancouver on the Winter side \u2014 suddenly doesn\u2019t seem so outlandish. Given the current trend, there\u2019s no guaranteeing any city will want to host this behemoth past 2030. Dempsey, the Olympic skeptic, concedes the Olympics provide plenty of magic and power, \u201cbut that magic and power would be just as strong if there were one Winter and one Summer location for the Olympics, or some other process that allows you to host the Games without making exorbitant promises that lead to exorbitant costs.\u201d", "FILE - In this Nov. 3, 2018, file photo, Southern California head coach Clay Helton leads his team onto the field before an NCAA college football game in Corvallis, Ore.

Gonzalez, File)\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Clay Helton believes his job at Southern California is secure as he heads into two games that could determine whether he\u2019s right.\n\nThe coach addressed the pertinent topic of his future with the Trojans in a meeting this week, and he did it again when asked about it Tuesday night after practice. While he recognizes the fan unrest created by USC\u2019s 5-5 season, Helton told his players to focus on their upcoming rivalry games against UCLA and Notre Dame, not on whether he is about to make a sudden departure.\n\n\u201cI feel very secure in where I\u2019m at,\u201d Helton said. \u201cLike I told them, my plan is to be here for another 15 years. I\u2019d like to do it \u2019til I\u2019m 60, right here. That\u2019s my plan. Know this, I\u2019m not going anywhere. I want them to know my jaw is set.\u201d\n\nHelton is one season removed from leading USC to the Pac-12 title, and two seasons removed from winning the Rose Bowl in his first full year in charge of a program that he has twice rescued from turmoil. He is 32-15 as the Trojans\u2019 head coach, and his contract runs through 2023.\n\nBut the Trojans (5-5, 4-4 Pac-12) are out of the Pac-12 South race heading into their 88th crosstown showdown with the rebuilding Bruins (2-8, 2-5). After three defeats in their last four games, including an embarrassing performance by Helton\u2019s offense last weekend in a 15-14 loss to California, their bowl prospects are uncertain even with a sixth win.\n\nA sixth regular-season loss would be the most by a USC team since 2000 \u2014 the year before Pete Carroll took over. Helton has been coaching long enough to know there\u2019s a price to pay for such a season at a program with USC\u2019s expectations, but he doesn\u2019t expect it to be his job.\n\n\u201cI have a lot of support from (athletic director) Lynn Swann,\u201d Helton said. \u201cLynn, every Monday, walks into my office and has given me nothing but, \u2018Coach, we\u2019re in this for the long haul.\u2019 We\u2019re going to get this done. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve felt from Day One, and what I felt after the Cal game also. I know, in my heart, I\u2019m going to be here. ... The only pressure I feel is to help a bunch of seniors and a bunch of kids go out and get the Victory Bell one more year.\u201d\n\nSwann gave a hefty contract extension to Helton last winter even though he didn\u2019t hire the coach, and he has remained publicly behind Helton.\n\nHelton\u2019s players also stood behind Helton after practice. They know the sky-high expectations placed on every USC team by its fans, and they say they\u2019re to blame for not reaching them.\n\n\u201cCoach Helton is worried about the ballgame,\u201d freshman quarterback J.T. Daniels said. \u201cHe\u2019s not worried about what some random dude in his pajamas is saying on Twitter. ... Nobody listens to Twitter. There\u2019s no requirement to have a Twitter account. Anybody can tweet what they want at any time. It\u2019s on us as players to realize just because a lot of people are saying it, doesn\u2019t make it true.\u201d\n\nHelton said he addressed his job status with his team because he knows social media chatter can get in the players\u2019 heads. Helton has never been a popular hire with a vocal online segment of the USC fan base despite his stabilizing influence on the program and two seasons of immediate success with Sam Darnold as his starting quarterback.\n\nA big finish to the regular season would relieve much of the pressure, and the Trojans would love to give it to Helton.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there is a situation,\u201d receiver Michael Pittman Jr. said. \u201cI feel like Coach Helton has become a better head coach this season. It may not seem like it to people outside, but I feel like he\u2019s taken steps. He\u2019s doing the right thing. It may not be the prettiest ... (but) he\u2019s coaching us hard, and I couldn\u2019t be more proud of the changes he\u2019s made. People see it as he\u2019s ruining the team, but he\u2019s actually making it better.

They\u2019re keeping their bigger ones \u2014 for now.\n\nCleveland began what could be a busy offseason on Wednesday by dealing versatile infielder Erik Gonzalez to the Pittsburgh Pirates as part of a five-player swap.\n\nThe AL Central champions sent the 27-year-old Gonzalez, who appeared in 81 games for the Indians last season, along with minor league right-handers Tahnaj Thomas and Dante Mendoza to the Pirates for outfielder Jordan Luplow and infielder Max Moroff.\n\nGonzalez batted .265 with one homer and 16 RBIs last season for Cleveland, which signed the Dominican native in 2009. And while he filled a valuable utility role, he was not going to crack the starting lineup behind All-Stars Francisco Lindor and Jose Ramirez.\n\n\u201cThat was a tough thing for us,\u201d Indians president of baseball operations Chris Antonetti said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had multiple conversations with Erik about it. He\u2019s done so many things to impact the organization in his time with us, from the time he signed. He\u2019s played every position on the field I think other than catcher at one point or another. But, as our roster has taken shape over the course of the past few seasons, we have not had an opportunity for him to play regularly.\n\n\u201cSo, we feel this will give Erik an opportunity to play more with Pittsburgh and continue his career and potentially blossom into the everyday player we think he can be.\u201d\n\nThe negligible move gives the Indians needed depth in the outfield, and it could be the first of many deals this winter.\n\nCleveland has not dismissed speculation it may be willing to trade prominent players, including ace Corey Kluber and right-hander Carlos Carrasco. Antonetti said it\u2019s difficult to measure whether the team has seen an increase in teams wanting to do business with the Indians.\n\n\u201cI think what I would reiterate is that I think the conversations have reaffirmed for us that we have a lot of players on our roster and throughout our organization that are of interest to other teams,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think what that allows us to do is have a lot of dialogue with other teams about potential opportunities for us to move forward as an organization and get better.\u201d\n\nThe 25-year-old Luplow is one of those opportunities. Cleveland\u2019s outfield was decimated by injuries last season, and the team is not expected to re-sign Michael Brantley as a free agent.\n\nLuplow appeared in 64 games over the past two seasons with the Pirates, who named him their top minor league player in 2017.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s capable of playing all three outfield spots,\u201d Antonetti said. \u201cHe\u2019s spent most of the time in left and right, but we also believe he has the ability to play center field. He complements our roster really well as a right-handed-hitting outfielder that we think is capable of helping us at the major league level.\u201d\n\nMoroff has split the last three seasons between Triple-A Indianapolis and Pittsburgh, appearing in 26 games for the Pirates in 2018.\n\nAntonetti dealing young players \u2014 especially pitchers \u2014 like Thomas and Mendoza is difficult, but sometimes necessary.\n\n\u201cTwo young pitchers out in Arizona that we like, that have some upside,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously, they\u2019re a little ways away from the major Leagues, being both 19 years old. So, guys that definitely have some potential to continue to grow and develop and develop into major league pitchers. But, for us to acquire Max and Jordan, we thought it was a worthwhile deal for us to make, because they\u2019re two guys that can help our Major League team here in the near future.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "", "", "", "CORVALLIS, Ore.

(AP Photo/Bebeto Matthews)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The total value of the incentive package New York is using to lure Amazon could top $2.8 billion.\n\nAmazon announced Tuesday that it would build new headquarters in New York City and Washington D.C.\u2019s Virginia suburbs, each of which would host around 25,000 workers.\n\nThe New York City headquarters, built on the East River waterfront in Queens, would vault Amazon into the ranks of the city\u2019s top private-sector employers while transforming a site now mostly occupied by industrial buildings and parking lots.\n\nSnagging the online retailer, though, comes at a cost.\n\nIn addition to nearly $1.53 billion in tax credits and grants offered by the state, Amazon would also qualify for two big tax breaks from the city.\n\nIf it creates 25,000 jobs, as promised, Amazon would qualify for a city corporate income tax credit worth nearly $900 million over 12 years. On top of that, it would get a 15-year property-tax abatement worth an estimated $386 million.\n\nThose city tax credits aren\u2019t unique to the Amazon deal. They have long been available to other companies, too, as a way of incentivizing growth and development outside Manhattan\u2019s crowded business districts.\n\nGov. Andrew Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said they expect to more than recoup that amount in the form of personal income taxes paid by Amazon\u2019s employees, sales tax and economic activity generated by the company\u2019s presence.\n\nCuomo on Tuesday predicted that the project would eventually bring in $27.5 billion in new state revenue over the next 25 years, though that figure would depend on Amazon creating 40,000 new jobs in New York City \u2014 far more than the initial 25,000 it has promised. State budget director Robert Mujica said that calculation also includes an assumption that other businesses not connected to Amazon will have to hire as many as 67,000 workers to serve the needs of the company and its employees.\n\nSome experts say that revenue projection, which includes ancillary jobs like a food vendor who sells sandwiches to Amazon workers, may overestimate the company\u2019s impact.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a big fan of counting the indirect jobs,\u201d said Nicole Gelinas, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute. She said vendors would likely sell to someone else if Amazon weren\u2019t there.\n\nCity and state officials did not provide an estimate of tax revenues from Amazon jobs alone.", "RALEIGH, N.C.

Most steelhead that return to Idaho from the ocean were raised in hatcheries. But some steelhead are wild fish that began life as eggs in river gravel.\n\nIdaho wild steelhead have been struggling and were listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act in 1997.\n\nWild steelhead caught by anglers must be returned to the river unharmed. But a small percentage of wild fish that are caught and released by sport anglers die as a result. For Idaho to allow the incidental capture of wild steelhead and the resulting deaths, it needs the federal government\u2019s approval of its Fisheries Management and Evaluation Plan.\n\nState officials say they applied for such a plan with the Fisheries Division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration after the plan expired in 2010, but haven\u2019t yet received one.\n\n\u201cThey have chosen to address their resources to other high priority permitting issues,\u201d Lance Hebdon, an Idaho fishery manager, told the commission on Wednesday.\n\nKevin Lewis of Idaho Rivers United said the groups haven\u2019t decided whether to move forward with a lawsuit.\n\n\u201cWe sent notice of intent because there was no plan,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is now a draft plan.

About 95,000 steelhead, including 30,000 wild steelhead, have been counted passing Bonneville Dam on the Columbia River between July 1 and Nov. 12. That\u2019s the lowest overall number since 1978, and the lowest wild steelhead number since 1996.\n\nState officials say if the state\u2019s plan is reauthorized by the federal government, steelhead fishing in Idaho could reopen in the spring.", "In this 1933 photo released by Alexander Historical Auctions, Adolf Hitler embraces Rosa Bernile Nineau, who was nearly 6,, at his mountainside Bavarian retreat in Germany.

Security Council voted unanimously Wednesday to lift sanctions against Eritrea following its thaw in relations with Ethiopia and other neighboring countries \u2014 but it kept an arms embargo on Somalia and a ban on trade in charcoal, a key source of funds for al-Shabab militants.\n\nThe resolution approved by the U.N.\u2019s most powerful body commended \u201cefforts toward peace, stability and reconciliation in the region\u201d sparked by Ethiopia\u2019s reformist prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, who came to power in April and accepted an international commission\u2019s border decision that favored Eritrea.\n\nEthiopia is the regional power and actions by the country\u2019s leader set off several diplomatic thaws, including one between Eritrea and Somalia. Leaders of Djibouti and Eritrea, which also had a turbulent relationship after multiple border clashes, met with the help of Ethiopia, though there has been no breakthrough.\n\nAhmed\u2019s office said after the vote that the lifting of sanctions will have far-reaching effects in improving stability and building lasting peace and normal relations in the Horn of Africa region.\n\n\u201cIt will further enhance the collaborative gains that have been achieved in the region over the past few months,\u201d the Ethiopian prime minister\u2019s office said.\n\nEritrea, a former Italian colony, gained independence from Ethiopia in 1993 after a 30-year guerrilla war. It had a decades-long border dispute with Ethiopia, including a war from 1998-2000 in which about 80,000 people died.\n\nThe Security Council imposed an arms embargo and other tough sanctions on Eritrea in 2009 for supplying weapons to Somalia\u2019s Islamic extremist al-Shabab rebels, who are opposed to the Somali government, and for refusing to resolve a border dispute with Djibouti, a key U.S. ally in the Horn of Africa.\n\nEritrea\u2019s Charge d\u2019Affaires Amanuel Giorgio called the sanctions \u201cunwarranted punitive measures\u201d and told the council after the vote that \u201cthe long overdue call for justice is finally answered.\u201d\n\nHe congratulated the people of Eritrea \u201con this historic day,\u201d and stressed that \u201cEritreans are extremely joyous and full of pride to have witnessed the recent positive regional developments ... (that) mark the beginning of a new dawn.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile proud of the region\u2019s capability to resolve intransigent conflicts at unprecedented speed, we are not complacent,\u201d Giorgio said. \u201cEritrea recognizes that a more difficult and complex task is waiting ahead. It is determined to redouble its own efforts and work closely with its neighbors to build a region at peace with itself.\u201d\n\nThe resolution immediately lifts \u201cthe arms embargoes, travel bans, asset freezes and targeted sanctions imposed on Eritrea by the Security Council.\u201d\n\nBut the Netherlands\u2019 ambassador, Karel van Oosterom, stressed that other demands by the council including that Eritrea \u201cshall cease using illicit means to collect taxes outside of Eritrea\u201d remain valid. The Netherlands has said extortion and threats of force against its large Eritrean diaspora is a sensitive issue that is high on the country\u2019s political agenda.\n\nThe resolution urges Eritrea and Djibouti \u201cto continue efforts to settle their border dispute peacefully ... by conciliation, arbitration or judicial settlement, or by any other means of pacific dispute settlement\u201d in the U.N. Charter. And it urges the two countries to engage on the issue of combatants from Djibouti missing in action.\n\nThe Security Council said, \u201cit will continue to follow developments towards the normalization of relations between Eritrea and Djibouti.\u201d\n\nDjibouti\u2019s U.N. Ambassador Siad Doualeh welcomed the lifting of sanctions against Eritrea, but said third-party mediation \u201cfailed to make significant progress toward a settlement\u201d of the boundary dispute.\n\nHe reiterated Djibouti\u2019s call for a final settlement by an impartial third party, such as an international arbitration tribunal or the International Court of Justice, of land and maritime boundaries and sovereignty over Doumeira Island.\n\n\u201cBut continued stalemate is not an option! We need to expedite the process!\u201d Doualeh said.\n\nAs for Somalia, the resolution condemns continuing attacks by al-Shabab in the country and beyond and expresses concern at the presence of affiliates of the Islamic State extremist group \u201cand the security implications of the situation in Yemen for Somalia.\u201d\n\nIt commends efforts by Somalia\u2019s federal government to restore key economic and financial institutions and implement anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism measures. But it expresses concern at continued reports of corruption and diversion of public resources, including reports of \u201calleged financial impropriety\u201d involving members of the government, parliament and opposition.\n\nThe resolution extends both the arms embargo on Somalia and the ban on the import and export of Somali charcoal until Nov. 15, 2019, as the council expressed concern that the charcoal trade is providing \u201csignificant funding for al-Shabab.\u201d\n\nIt condemns al-Shabab\u2019s \u201cincreased revenue from natural resources including the taxing of the illicit sugar trade, agricultural production and livestock\u201d and its involvement in the illicit charcoal trade.\n\nSomalia\u2019s U.N.

He takes office Jan. 1.\n\nCuba made the announcement after Bolsonaro said the program overseen by the World Health Organization could only continue if doctors directly received their salaries from Brazil, and were able to bring their families with them during their assignments, among other conditions.\n\nThe Cuban government generally keeps most of the salaries of state employees working abroad as part of the socialist state\u2019s \u201cinternational missions.\u201d Participants also are generally barred from bringing family members in a measure that critics say is designed to prevent doctors from emigrating.\n\n\u201cMas Medicos\u201d started five years ago under leftist President Dilma Rousseff. Cuba said roughly 20,000 doctors saw millions of patients in areas such as the Amazon rainforest and slums of major cities.\n\nCuba maintains similar missions in 67 other countries but \u201cMas Medicos\u201d was one of the largest and most important, serving as a link between the cash-strapped island and South America\u2019s largest economy.\n\n\u201cCubans have provided a valuable service to the Brazilian people with dignity, deep sensitivity, professionality, dedication and altruism,\u201d Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel wrote on Twitter. \u201cSuch humane acts should be respected and defended.\u201d\n\nAll Cuban doctors work for the state and virtually all receive salaries that are well below $100 a month. Doctors are not permitted to leave Cuba without government permission, a control that was lifted for virtually all other Cubans five years ago.\n\nThousands of Cuban doctors work in the island\u2019s public health-care system, which suffers from crumbling infrastructure but still provides free and universal health care to all citizens. Thousands of other Cuban doctors go abroad each year and generate billions of dollars for the state, one of Cuba\u2019s most important sources of foreign exchange.\n\nThe doctors generally receive a fraction of the salary paid to the Cuban government. But even that fraction far exceeds the salaries of doctors working in Cuba. That drives many doctors to complete foreign missions in order to earn cash for important expenses like home repairs, appliances or a motor vehicle.\n\nThe Brazilian Ministry of Health said there were 8,332 Cuban doctors in Brazil, each costing the country roughly $3,100 a month, plus room and board.\n\nBolsonaro said Brazil would offer asylum to Cuban doctors who wished to stay in Brazil.\n\n\u201cThis is slave labor,\u201d he said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be an accomplice of that.\u201d\n\nNeither side said exactly when the Cuban doctors would be leaving but their departure comes at a bad time for Cuba, which is facing its third year of slow growth, expected to be around 1 percent this year. Productivity is low in virtually every state-run industry, tourism has slowed under the Trump administration and Venezuela, a key ally, has cut back on subsidized oil and other aid.\n\nNonetheless, Bolsonaro\u2019s conditions were out of the question for Cuba.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not acceptable to question the dignity, professionalism and altruism of Cubans who, with the support of their families, provide services in 67 countries,\u201d the Cuban health ministry said in a statement. \u201cThe Brazilian people will understand who bears the responsibility for the fact that our doctors can\u2019t keep providing their support and solidarity in that nation.\u201d\n\n_______\n\nDe Sousa reported from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

The U.S. Senate has approved a new policy on ships that dump ballast water in coastal ports and the Great Lakes, a practice blamed for spreading invasive species that damage the environment and the economy. The ballast plan is contained in a $10.6 billion Coast Guard budget authorization bill passed Wednesday Nov. 14, 2018. It now goes to the House for consideration. (AP Photo/Carlos Osorio File)\n\nTRAVERSE CITY, Mich. (AP) \u2014 The U.S. Senate approved a compromise policy Wednesday on dumping ship ballast water in coastal ports and the Great Lakes, a practice blamed for spreading invasive species that damage the environment and the economy.\n\nThe plan, part of a $10.6 billion Coast Guard budget authorization bill, includes provisions sought by environmentalists as well as the cargo shipping industry. They have battled for years over how to regulate disposal of water stored in tanks that is essential for steadying vessels in rough seas but has brought unwanted mussels, fish and even viruses to U.S. waters.\n\nUnder the bill, approved 94-6 and sent to the House for consideration, the Environmental Protection Agency would set national rules for ballast and other water discharges while the Coast Guard would enforce them. An earlier version backed by industry would have put the Coast Guard in charge of regulation and exempted ballast from the Clean Water Act, which environmentalists feared would result in weaker requirements for treating the water before it\u2019s released.\n\nBut in a victory for shippers, states would be prohibited from imposing tougher treatment rules than EPA\u2019s. Presently, 26 states have rules in addition to those on federal level, creating what the industry describes as a confusing regulatory patchwork. Environmentalists contend states should be able to exceed federal standards to safeguard their waterways.\n\nThe bill creates an exception for the Great Lakes, where damages and control costs from quagga mussels and other exotic organisms reach $200 million annually. Regional requirements could be imposed there if enough of the eight states that border the lakes want them.\n\nRepublican Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio and Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, co-chairs of the Senate Great Lakes Task Force, said EPA policy required under the bill \u201cwill help prevent pollution and ensure that that ballast water does not transport invasive species from one body of water to another along a vessel\u2019s shipping route, while providing greater regulatory certainty for the shipping industry.\u201d\n\nDebate will persist even if the measure is enacted. Federal policy currently limits numbers of live organisms in ballast water before it\u2019s discharged, based on international standards that environmentalists contend are too weak. A federal court has ordered EPA to strengthen the standards, noting the availability of treatment tools such as chlorine, ultraviolet light and filtration. Shippers contend available technology can\u2019t hit the cleanliness targets environmentalists want.\n\nEPA will grapple with such issues as it develops national rules.\n\nStill, both sides praised the bill. The Lake Carriers\u2019 Association, representing Great Lakes cargo shippers, said it strikes a \u201cgood balance,\u201d while an environmentalist coalition said it \u201cupholds many core protections to prevent future invasions.\u201d\n\nThe bill authorizes $10.6 billion for the Coast Guard in fiscal year 2019, a roughly 16 percent increase from 2017 that would help modernize its aging fleet of cutters and aircraft. The Coast Guard is the primary federal authority for maritime safety and security on the U.S. coast and in ports and inland waterways.\n\n\u201cPassing it will ensure the Coast Guard has the tools it needs to continue to carry out its many important missions,\u201d said Sen. Bill Nelson, a Florida Democrat.\n\nThe measure also contains provisions to help the agency crack down on drug smuggling and enforce borders through use of informants and greater cooperation with other agencies. It also boost efforts to place and maintain navigational aids and enter less expensive contracts for acquiring the largest and most technologically advanced cutters.\n\nOther provisions would create a Coast Guard center to develop responses to oil spills in the Great Lakes and other freshwater environments and authorize funding to design and build a National Coast Guard Museum in New London, Connecticut.\n\n___\n\nAP reporter Kevin Freking in Washington, D.C., contributed to this story.", "NEW HAVEN, Conn.

British Prime Minister Theresa May says Cabinet agrees draft Brexit deal with European Union after 'impassioned' debate. (AP Photo/Matt Dunham)\n\nLONDON (AP) \u2014 Like white smoke from the Vatican announcing a new pope, the signal from Britain\u2019s Cabinet table says: We have a decision.\n\nAfter a year and a half of negotiating with the European Union \u2014 and fighting with itself \u2014 the U.K. government on Wednesday backed a deal to allow Britain\u2019s orderly exit from the bloc, and paint the outlines of future relations.\n\nPrime Minister Theresa May\u2019s fractious Conservative government agreed on a deal that solves the key outstanding issue \u2014 how to ensure a frictionless border between the U.K.\u2019s Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland after Brexit. The \u201cbackstop\u201d plan involves keeping the U.K. in a customs union with the EU until a permanent trade treaty is worked out.\n\nIt\u2019s a breakthrough, but the path to Brexit day \u2014 just over four months away on March 29 \u2014 remains rocky.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at what is likely to happen next:\n\nBEELINE TO BRUSSELS\n\nMay is due to update Parliament on Thursday on what has been agreed, while Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab will likely head to Brussels to meet with chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier.\n\nBarnier declared there has been \u201cdecisive progress\u201d toward a deal \u2014 the phrase that allows EU leaders to call a special summit to approve the deal. They have penciled in a meeting for Nov. 25.\n\nThe deal consists of two parts: a legally binding withdrawal agreement \u2014 which includes the border backstop \u2014 and a looser framework for future relations. The two sides have given themselves a transition period until the end of 2020 to work out the details of future trade ties.\n\nPERIL IN PARLIAMENT\n\nOnce the EU has signed off on it, the deal also must be approved by the European and British parliaments\n\nMay hopes to get it passed by U.K. lawmakers before Christmas. Business groups warn that most U.K. companies will implement Brexit contingency plans \u2014 cutting jobs, stockpiling goods, relocating production \u2014 if there isn\u2019t clarity by then about the terms of Brexit.\n\nBut she faces an uphill battle. May\u2019s Conservative Party doesn\u2019t hold a majority of seats in the House of Commons, and relies on 10 lawmakers from Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party to win votes. But the DUP says it will reject any deal that treats Northern Ireland differently to the rest of the U.K.\n\nSeveral dozen pro-Brexit Conservatives have vowed to oppose any arrangement that keeps Britain in a customs union, and tied to EU trade rules, indefinitely.\n\nThe main opposition Labour Party also says it will oppose any deal that doesn\u2019t offer the same benefits Britain currently has as a member of the EU\u2019s single market and customs union.\n\nMay is calculating that, faced with the prospect of a chaotic \u201cno-deal\u201d exit \u2014 complete with financial turmoil, gridlock at U.K. ports and shortages of essential goods \u2014 most Conservatives and some opposition lawmakers will crumble and support the deal.\n\nUNCHARTED TERRITORY\n\nIf Parliament rejects the deal, Britain enters unknown territory.\n\nLawmakers could try to send the government back to the negotiating table with the EU, though there\u2019s no simple mechanism to make that happen. They could defeat the government in a no-confidence vote in an attempt to trigger a national election.\n\nLawmakers could even vote for a new referendum on EU membership, though it seems unlikely there would be time to hold one before the U.K.\u2019s scheduled departure date. The U.K. will cease to be an EU member on March 29 \u2014 deal or no deal.\n\nIain Begg, a professor at the London School of Economics\u2019 European Institute, said rejection of a deal would trigger a major political crisis because Britain\u2019s patchwork constitution offers no \u201cprescribed way out of that dilemma.\u201d\n\nHe said in that case, \u201cwe really are into a period of great uncertainty about what happens next.

It\u2019s still a huge accomplishment, especially considering Democrats had to overcome obstacles like GOP voter-ID laws and gerrymandered districts.\n\nLook at it this way: The Republicans becoming the party of bucking political norms and locking the people out of participating in broad swaths of government didn\u2019t happen with Donald Trump descending a golden escalator. It started with the midterms in 1994, when political figures like Newt Gingrich came to power. ...\n\nBig changes don\u2019t always start with getting everything you want right away. Americans tend to think like that sometimes, but it\u2019s usually not the case. Bonus: In this instance, a big change actually occurred.\n\nDoes it mean Trump will suddenly become presidential, treat opponents with dignity, no longer engage in dangerous foreign policy and stop trying to get Mueller off his back? His infantile news conference the day after the elections, followed by the firing of Jeff Sessions, indicate that\u2019s a firm \u201cno.\u201d The world\u2019s slowest train wreck will continue. Fresh indignities will be suffered, sometimes multiple times a day before lunch. But, at least in January, a House will be seated that doesn\u2019t throw up its hands or look the other way when these things happen.\n\nHuge national strides were made on Election Day. That\u2019s something to build on, which is so much more than what was there before.\n\nOnline: https://www.wvgazettemail.com/\n\n___\n\nNov. 11\n\nThe Register-Herald on guns and gun violence:\n\nThe numbers, like the bodies, keep piling up. Mass shootings in the United States are so frequent, now, that we have a difficult time keeping track, of remembering the details of any specific murderous rampage, of separating the tragic stories of one city from another. Was the downtown shooting in Cincinnati at a yoga studio? Or was that Tallahassee? Was it in South Carolina where all the police officers were shot? Yes. Seven. Florence County.\n\nWe have read the troubling news bulletins to a string of recent terror. Late last month, there was the Pittsburgh synagogue slaughter in which a gunman, shouting, \u201cI just want to kill Jews,\u201d did just that - 11 worshippers on the Sabbath. And this past Wednesday, in the 12th mass shooting since Pittsburgh, 12 people - mostly kids in their 20s - were killed at a bar in California.\n\nThese numbers, these incidents, have now claimed their pages in the ignominious and expanding tome of American gun violence along with the stories out of Las Vegas, 59 dead, 422 injured from gunfire; Orlando, 50 dead, 53 injured; Virginia Tech, 33 dead, 23 injured; Sandy Hook Elementary, 28 dead, 2 injured; Sutherland Springs, 27 dead, 20 injured. Do you remember how many were killed at the San Ysidro MacDonald\u2019s? At Stoneman Douglas? Columbine?\n\nMostly, it is all a blur. But in total, that this is happening is a sad and dispiriting commentary on our collective lack of gumption to write law that targets access to weapons.\n\nGun Violence Archive tracks gun violence in the U.S. Here is how it defines a mass shooting: an event in which four or more people - excluding the shooter - are shot in any one location. By those standards, there have been 311 mass shootings in America in 2018. The human toll: 314 killed, 1,270 wounded.\n\n...\n\nThere is a ton of guns in America - far more than any other country. In an analysis by the Small Arms Survey for 2017, the U.S. had 120.5 guns per 100 residents. The math is easy - more firearms than people.\n\nWhy is that? Well, Americans like guns and the freedom to own. And, because of that, U.S. laws are uniquely weak. Other developed nations require - at the very least - one or more background checks along with training courses and rules for locking up firearms. Licensing is strict, as are justifications for owning.\n\nThe result of a gun-loving population and laws that allow easy access? Research, compiled by the Harvard School of Public Health\u2019s Injury Control Research Center, is clear: Places with more guns have more gun deaths. The U.S. has nearly six times the gun homicide rate of Canada and nearly 16 times that of Germany, according to United Nations data for 2012.\n\nThe living victims of these mass shootings - the moms and dads, the brothers and sisters, friends and neighbors, others who were in the bar when shots rang out - are asking for action. And if America is truly a compassionate country, as we often tell ourselves, we should listen and then we should act.\n\nWe believe in the Second Amendment. And we are not coming for anyone\u2019s guns. But we believe we can do better in providing for the general welfare and safety of all by restricting access to weapons. Until we accept the facts, until we examine the stats, until we acknowledge the reality, then history has proven the mass shootings will continue apace.\n\n...\n\nOnline: https://www.register-herald.com\n\n___\n\nNov. 13\n\nBluefield Daily Telegraph on the closing of the all-terrain vehicle Pocahontas Trail system:\n\nSo just how significant is the looming \u201ctemporary closure\u201d of the Hatfield McCoy Trail system on Mercer County? Consider this. Hundreds of jobs and millions of dollars in business and tax revenue are on the line. Spending in Mercer County by trail visitors totaled at least $106 million in 2017 in lodging, gas, food and shopping. That brought in $8.7 million in local and state taxes.\n\nMercer County currently has 1,500 tourism jobs with earnings topping $26 million a year, according to Jamie Null, executive director of the Mercer County Visitors and Convention Bureau. The agency collects data regarding tourism in the county, including from the state\u2019s department of tourism. Furthermore, a recent Bluefield College study found that ATV riders spend an average of 3.2 days in the county and each person spends about $150 a day. Many of those visitors are in large groups, and they often bring family and friends with them who also spend money in the area.\n\nAlso complicating matters is the immediate impact on local businesses with accommodations for ATV riders. Some of those establishments are already seeing reservations canceled as a result of the scheduled Dec. 3 closure of the Pocahontas Trail system.\n\nThis is a crisis for Mercer County. Now that officials have had about three weeks to mull over the circumstances surrounding this temporary closure, it is imperative that they take steps to protect all of the jobs, businesses and tourism revenue that is now at risk.\n\nThe good news is that officials are starting to work toward that cause. A meeting was held last week where county commissioners and state lawmakers were in attendance, along with local ATV resort owners, tourism officials and other individuals.\n\n\u201cHow can we keep this trail open?\u201d County Commission President Gene Buckner asked the group. \u201cWe need to get all of our heads together before we do anything else.\u201d\n\nBuckner says the still unidentified coal company that will begin operations near the trail system is leasing the land near the trail from Pocahontas Land Company and can basically do what it wants.\n\nThe coal company has requested that the trail be closed because the proximity of the trail presents a safety issue as it expands its operations near Windmill Gap Road. A new trail will be built in Mercer County, according to Hatfield-McCoy Trail officials, who are already working to map out the new system. But it could take at least three months, or possibly longer, to get that new trail ready.\n\nSkip Crane, president of the Bluewell Improvement Association, wants the Hatfield-McCoy Trail to work with the mining company. \u201cPresent the facts to them,\u201d Crane said. \u201cTake a calm approach with facts to see what you can work out.\u201d\n\nDel. John Shott, R-Mercer, will be part of a meeting planned with Hatfield-McCoy personnel and says a plan needs to be formulated and presented to the coal company. \u201cPhasing it (the closure) over time is possible,\u201d Shott said, which could leave much of the trail open.\n\nThere are still many questions that need to be answered.\n\nEveryone needs to be talking, and the trail authority should be actively communicating with local leaders and business owners. In the meantime, it is our hope that the Hatfield-McCoy Trail Authority can get a new trail system up and running in Mercer County as quickly as possible. A new trail will help to preserve jobs, tax revenue and six years of impressive tourism growth for Mercer County.\n\nOnline: https://www.bdtonline.com/", "ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 The Georgia House is expected to vote Thursday on proposals for $470 million in relief for damage from Hurricane Michael as lawmakers work rapidly to resolve a special session called by Gov. Nathan Deal.\n\nHouse committees Wednesday approved $270 million in storm-related funding that includes emergency aid and debris cleanup while also advancing $200 million in tax incentives to encourage timber and pecan growers to replant vast acreage destroyed in southern Georgia.\n\nDeal told lawmakers much of the cleanup and recovery money will be reimbursed by the federal government, though it\u2019s unknown how long that might take. He said farmers whose crops were devastated need immediate assistance, and timber smashed by the storm must be removed to keep heaps of dead wood from becoming fuel for possible wildfires.\n\n\u201cOur state has been struck by a disaster unlike any that we have really seen,\u201d Deal told the House Appropriations Committee. \u201cThe losses that are sustained and will have to be dealt with are of a magnitude that most of us have a hard time imagining.\u201d\n\nAgriculture Commissioner Gary Black blames the hurricane for more than $1.6 billion in ruined crops from pecans and cotton to corn and squash. The Georgia Forestry Commission estimates timber losses exceeded $762 million.\n\nGeorgians also claimed $696 million in insured losses to homes, businesses and vehicles \u2014 a higher cost than the state\u2019s combined losses claimed from Hurricane Matthew in 2016 and Hurricane Irma last year.\n\nUnwilling to wait until the legislature returns for its regular session in January, Deal ordered a special session that began Tuesday. Legislative leaders in the House and Senate are trying to wrap up their short agenda in five days.\n\nDeal wants $69 million in additional funds to pay the state\u2019s share for disaster response costs as well as debris removal being overseen by the Army Corps of Engineers. There\u2019s also $55 million proposed for emergency assistance to farmers in counties damaged by the storm, plus another $20 million in emergency aid to assist cleanup by timberland owners.\n\nThe aid money covers just a fraction of the costs inflicted by the storm, which crossed Florida into southwest Georgia as a powerful Category 3 hurricane.\n\n\u201cObviously we cannot pay for all the losses,\u201d Deal told lawmakers Wednesday. \u201cBut we think we can afford to do this.\u201d\n\nLawmakers say higher-than-expected revenues this year should enable the state to pay for hurricane relief without dipping into budget reserves.\n\nThe House will also vote Thursday on tax incentives aimed at helping landowners replant trees lost to the storm. About 2.3 million acres (9,300 sq. kilometers) were damaged by the storm. Landowners would have to request approval for the credit before the end of 2019.\n\nState officials estimate the tax credit would cost $75 million in the 2020 fiscal year that starts July 1, then $95 million the following fiscal year. The credits would be capped at $200 million total.\n\nAlso Thursday, the full House is scheduled to vote on renewing Georgia\u2019s sales tax exemption on jet fuel. The Senate killed the perk, worth roughly $40 million, earlier this year to punish Delta Air Lines for ending fare discounts for members of the National Rifle Association.\n\nDeal salvaged the tax break with an executive order over the summer, but lawmakers must ratify the perk or airlines will owe fuel taxes retroactively to Aug. 1. Republican House Speaker David Ralston has said the tax perk faces a \u201ctough climb.\u201d\n\nAny of the three measures that pass the House on Thursday will still need approval by the state Senate.", "PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) \u2014 The Portland City Council on Wednesday rejected an ordinance that would have given Mayor Ted Wheeler new powers to regulate protests.\n\nThe mayor\u2019s proposal failed 2-3 when Commissioner Nick Fish cast the deciding vote against it, the Oregonian/OregonLive reported .\n\nFish, an attorney, said his decision was \u201ca close call\u201d and that he was wary of any restrictions on free speech that may not pass legal muster. \u201cI\u2019m not convinced that we\u2019ve done everything we can with the tools already at our disposal,\u201d Fish said.\n\nCommissioners Amanda Fritz and Chloe Eudaly also voted no. Wheeler and Commissioner Dan Saltzman voted yes.\n\nWheeler\u2019s ordinance would have given him the power to dictate the conditions of rallies, such as where and when they may be held, if demonstrators have a history of violence and if public safety was jeopardized.\n\nThe mayor said he and Police Chief Danielle Outlaw developed the idea in response to a growing number of violent demonstrations in Portland since 2016, where right-wing and left-wing protesters clash.\n\nOutlaw has said those protests are difficult to police. She and the mayor contend new so-called \u201ctime, place and manner\u201d restrictions on public gatherings would keep the public safer.\n\nEudaly said she believes Wheeler and Outlaw are well-intentioned and want to curtail political extremism. Yet Eudaly said she cannot \u201cvote to expand their powers\u201d in light of her view that significant police reforms are necessary.\n\nWheeler on Wednesday called his proposal legal, reasonable and necessary and criticized news coverage that called into question whether his proposal was constitutional.\n\nThe mayor also expressed exasperation and weariness. He said he tried unsuccessfully to keep right-wing agitators away from Portland by making public pleas. And he noted that the federal government declined his request to deny the right-wing Patriot Prayer group a protest permit, a request that drew condemnation of Wheeler because it was seen as an effort to curtail free expression.\n\nWheeler also appeared determined.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to do a lot of different things,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to enforce the laws.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Oregonian/OregonLive, http://www.oregonlive.com", "The California state Capitol is viewed through the smoke from the Camp Fire, Tuesday, Nov. 13, 2018, in Sacramento, Calif.

An analyst with Citi Investment Research estimates damages from the fire could exceed $15 billion but noted that the state of California \u201cwill likely step in to protect the utility and its customers.\u201d\n\nIn a lawsuit filed this week, Californians who have lost homes in the state\u2019s deadliest and most destructive wildfire said a high voltage transmission line failed, sparking the fire.

North Dakota water officials say the company developing the oil refinery has supplied adequate information to justify drawing water from an underwater aquifer. An attorney for area landowners challenging the recommended permit for the Davis Refinery counters that information from Meridian Energy Group has been vague and contradictory. The arguments came Wednesday, Nov. 14 during a hearing before an administrative law judge. (Tom Stromme /The Bismarck Tribune via AP, File)\n\nBISMARCK, N.D. (AP) \u2014 A company developing an oil refinery near Theodore Roosevelt National Park in North Dakota has supplied adequate information to justify drawing water from an underwater aquifer, State Water Commission officials testified Wednesday.\n\nAn attorney for area landowners challenging the recommended permit for the Davis Refinery countered that information from developer Meridian Energy Group has been vague and contradictory.\n\nThe water permit is one of several hurdles that Meridian must overcome as it seeks to build the refinery just 3 miles (5 kilometers) from the state\u2019s top tourist attraction. Administrative Law Judge Tim Dawson later will issue a recommendation to State Engineer Garland Erbele, whose final decision could be appealed to state court.\n\nThe disagreement over the water permit centers around a related dispute over how big the refinery will actually be. Meridian in May 2016 applied for a permit to draw about 645 acre-feet of water per year from the underground Dakota Aquifer for a refinery that would process up to 55,000 barrels of oil per day Large volumes of water are commonly measured by the acre-foot in the U.S. One acre-foot is enough water to cover 1 acre (4,047 sq. meters) of land 1 foot (0.3 meter) deep and equals about 326,000 gallons (271,455 imperial gallons).\n\nThe company later reduced the planned oil capacity to 49,500 barrels, just shy of a 50,000-barrel threshold in state law that requires a site permit from the state Public Service Commission. Meridian has denied trying to skirt state law, and state regulators last month concluded that they had no jurisdiction to intervene. Environmental groups that oppose the refinery are challenging that in state court.\n\nGiven the reduction in the project capacity, the state engineer\u2019s office has recommended that the company be issued a water permit with a corresponding reduction, to about 586 acre-feet annually. Landowner attorney JJ England has argued that the change to the company\u2019s request is illegal and that the application should have been rejected.\n\nArea landowners have raised other concerns, including how they might be affected, how much of the water will be wasted during treatment and how wastewater from the refinery will be handled. Meridian has not applied for a wastewater discharge permit from the state Health Department, according to Water Quality Division Director Karl Rockeman.\n\nWednesday\u2019s hearing centered on whether Meridian will use all of the water for which it has applied for a \u201cbeneficial\u201d use. England stressed that Meridian\u2019s plans for treating and using the water are vague and at times have conflicting information.\n\n\u201cThe state engineer has not established Meridian\u2019s intent to the requisite legal standard, and a number of significant questions remain,\u201d he told Dawson.\n\nWater Appropriations Division Director Jon Patch and Hydrologist Manager Kimberly Fischer testified that information Meridian has supplied is enough to warrant a conditional water permit that will be fine-tuned after refinery operations begin and its precise water needs are determined.\n\n\u201cIf we would approve (the permit), and they ultimately aren\u2019t using that amount of water, we would perfect the permit for the amount that they are using and have shown the need for,\u201d Patch said.\n\nMeridian began site work in July , a month after receiving an air quality permit from the state Health Department that deemed the refinery a minor source of pollution.

It also establishes guidelines for the use of force.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in Schuylkill County Court, contends the policy violates the Pennsylvania School Code. The union said that any guns in school should be carried by school police officers, not teachers and staff.\n\n\u201cAs teachers, counselors, and other education professionals, we are trained to provide a high-quality education to our students, not to carry or use firearms in a dangerous situation,\u201d Frank Wenzel, president of the Tamaqua Education Association, said in a statement. \u201cThis is a bad policy for a lot of reasons, but we are challenging it in court because we believe it is illegal.\u201d\n\nA number of parents protested the idea of arming teachers at a board meeting this month.\n\nBoard President Larry Wittig told The Philadelphia Inquirer on Wednesday that the board has no plans to eliminate the policy, but might consider changes.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to note suit was filed Wednesday rather than Tuesday.", "NORTH HAVEN, Conn.

(AP) \u2014 The Illinois Senate on Wednesday rejected Gov. Bruce Rauner\u2019s veto of legislation designed to ensure immigrant crime victims who cooperate with police get the assistance they need to stay in the country.\n\nThe 40-12 vote to override the Republican\u2019s veto came just a week after the end of a national election campaign in which GOP President Donald Trump made illegal immigration a key issue.\n\nBut Senate President John Cullerton, a Chicago Democrat, referenced what he called the \u201cugly black-market sex trade\u201d that coerces girls and women from other countries into coming to the U.S. as justification for setting a 90-day deadline for police agencies to sign the paperwork necessary for immigrants to apply for visas and avoid deportation.\n\n\u201cIt simply sets a deadline to wrap up the paperwork,\u201d Cullerton said. \u201cIt\u2019s needed because some local officials never did it.\u201d\n\nHe said it will \u201cencourage victims to come out of the shadows and work with police.\u201d\n\nFederal law created the visas in 2000 to aid victims of sex trafficking and other serious crimes.\n\nRauner complained in his veto that local law enforcement agencies lack the resources to meet a hard deadline. He said it would pressure them into committing inadvertent errors or even perjury.\n\nThe vote was one of several the Senate took on vetoes during the first week of its fall session.\n\nSenators voted 36-19 to reverse the governor\u2019s veto on legislation prohibiting the sale of tobacco products to those under 21.\n\nSen. Julie Morrison\u2019s proposal would include cigarettes, cigars, chewing tobacco, snuff, e-cigarettes and vaping materials. The Deerfield Democrat said smoking \u201cis not a right or a benefit \u2014 it\u2019s an addiction.\u201d\n\nOpponents complain that young adults who can vote and serve in the military should decide on tobacco use. And they noted the legislation has no penalties for buyers or sellers. That was a key factor in Rauner\u2019s veto.\n\nOther votes included overriding Rauner\u2019s vetoes on legislation requiring so-called peer-to-peer car-rental businesses to ensure participating vehicles meet the same safety standards and pay the same taxes as traditional rental-car companies, and on a measure that increases the damage award limit in lawsuits against the state to $2 million, up from $100,000.\n\nBut an override vote to remove Illinois from a contentious multistate voter registration system failed.\n\nThe move by Democratic Sen. Kwame Raoul of Chicago, the newly elected attorney general, fell one vote short of the 36 needed for an override.\n\nIt would take Illinois out of the Interstate Voter Registration Crosscheck Program run through the Kansas secretary of state\u2019s office. It\u2019s intended to flag duplicate voter registrations across state lines. Critics say the program is inaccurate and vulnerable to hackers.\n\nIn explaining the veto, Rauner wrote that the battle against vote fraud is fought by cross-referencing voter information from several states.\n\n___\n\nThe bills are SB34 , SB2332 , SB2641 , SB2481 and SB2273 .\n\n___\n\nFollow Political Writer John O\u2019Connor at https://twitter.com/apoconnor .", "ATHENS, Ohio (AP) \u2014 A university in Ohio has ordered a fraternity chapter to stop all activities after a student who recently pledged the group died.\n\nOhio University said in a statement Tuesday that it ordered the Epsilon Chapter of Sigma Pi Fraternity to immediately stop \u201call organizational activities.\u201d The order was issued a day after the 18-year-old student died.

Amazon announced Tuesday it has selected the Queens neighborhood as one of two sites for its headquarters. (AP Photo/Bebeto Matthews)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Amazon has just sparked a real estate frenzy to rival Cyber Monday.\n\nA three-bedroom condo with Manhattan views that had sat on the market for months, priced at $1.7 million, is suddenly drawing would-be buyers now that Amazon has announced plans to build part of its new second headquarters in Long Island City.\n\nOnline searches for homes in Long Island City \u2014 long an industrial area in the Queens borough of New York \u2014 soared 248 percent last week, the real estate brokerage Redfin said. Searches in the other winner of Amazon\u2019s sweepstakes, Crystal City, Virginia, jumped 84 percent. Real estate agents say they\u2019re hearing from investors who\u2019d like to become landlords and from sellers who\u2019ve decided to pull their homes off the market, sit back and wait for prices to go up, up, up.\n\nThe surge of interest has followed Amazon\u2019s selection of those two areas to each receive 25,000 new jobs paying an average of $150,000.\n\nThe two localities already reflect the ultra-pricey New York and Washington metro areas, though real estate sales there had been relatively modest of late. Worries are arising, in fact, that housing prices in both places\u2014 whether for renters or buyers \u2014 are destined to price out all but the most affluent in the coming years.\n\nThe same trend, critics note, has long been evident in such high-tech centers as San Francisco, San Jose, California, and Seattle, where Amazon is based. In those cities, low- and moderate-income families increasingly struggle to afford housing anywhere near their workplaces.\n\nOut of concern that Amazon\u2019s arrival could make homes prohibitively expensive, buyers around Crystal City are suddenly rushing to close on sales, said Brian MacMahon, a real estate agent with Redfin in Northern Virginia.\n\nEnvisioning a stream of rising rental income, investors are calling from as far as California to inquire about buying homes they could rent out or just let appreciate in value, MacMahon said. Two sellers have just pulled listings from the market, he said, so the homes could be re-listed next year, presumably at higher prices, after the market adjusts to Amazon\u2019s arrival.\n\n\u201cWhen we have nice stuff coming onto the market, it\u2019s flying off the shelf,\u201d MacMahon said.\n\nBy choosing the New York and Washington areas, Amazon has inadvertently thrown a spotlight on the gulf between a small group of thriving but high-cost U.S. cities and the rest of the country. Housing in Amazon\u2019s two new hubs are well more than twice the median home price nationwide of $255,000, according to ATTOM Data Solutions.\n\nThe median price in Arlington County has surged 12.5 percent so far this year to $585,000. In Queens County, the median has risen 7 percent to $630,000.\n\nAmazon executives were drawn to the sizable pools of well-educated and skilled workers in the two areas, which they chose over 18 other finalists with housing that has generally been less expensive.\n\n\u201cHome affordability was not a prime deciding factor for Amazon,\u201d said Daren Blomquist, senior vice president of ATTOM.\n\nIn some ways, Amazon had injected adrenaline into a New York City market where price growth had exceeded wage gains to the point that sales had begun to slow. Until last weekend, real estate agents say, attendance at open houses for condos in Long Island City had been sparse.\n\nThe $1.7 million condo at the Foundry building, with its private terrace and skyscraper views, was once the kind of showcase property that triggered competing bids within a few weeks. Buyers, though, had adopted a wait-and-see stance as mortgage rates rose, luxury construction flooded the market and interest from foreign buyers waned.\n\nYet over the weekend, open house attendance in Long Island City suddenly tripled as word of Amazon\u2019s announcement became public, said Christopher Austad, a real estate broker with Douglas Elliman.\n\n\u201cWe just caught a huge breath of fresh air \u2014 it\u2019s like someone just resuscitated us,\u201d Austad said. \u201cI\u2019ve had a dozen new buyers and investors reach out this week. I\u2019ve had past sellers contracting me and saying, \u2018Chris, we want to invest in LIC.\u2019 It\u2019s great.\u201d\n\nIn the Seattle area, Amazon\u2019s presence, along with that of other tech giants like Microsoft, is thought to have contributed to home values that have priced out even relatively affluent families and have left poorer residents with few options. Homelessness has worsened. Over the past five years, the median home value in Seattle has rocketed 73 percent to $739,600, according to an analysis by the real estate firm Zillow, which is also based there.\n\nPartly in response, the city approved a series of increases to its minimum wage that will reach as high as $16 an hour next year. It approved a corporate tax this year to help the homeless, though the tax was repealed after being challenged by the business community, including Amazon.\n\nAaron Terrazas, a senior economist at Zillow, said he thinks metro New York and Washington will avoid the same predicament.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we should expect a similar jump,\u201d Terrazas said. \u201cBoth New York and D.C. have demonstrated a capacity to add supply in ways that Seattle was reluctant to.\u201d\n\nBoth metro areas are already comfortable with building blocks of apartment and condo towers, he said. Their high-density construction makes it easier to accommodate the job growth than cities that prioritize single-family housing.\n\nThey also contain extensive mass transit networks. In theory at least, the New York and Washington subway systems can ease housing price pressures by enabling workers to spread out.\n\nStill, the benefits of mass transit depend on New York and Washington maintaining and improving their systems \u2014 a severe challenge in recent years amid breakdowns, deteriorating tracks and rising expenses in both transportation systems.\n\nYet the underlying message from Amazon\u2019s two selections is that big tech companies seem not to view housing costs as a barrier for hiring workers. Companies in Seattle and San Francisco have increasingly expressed concern that tech talent there would migrate to Salt Lake City, Boise or other cities where homes are more affordable.\n\nAmazon appears less concerned.\n\n\u201cThere was anxiety in Silicon Valley that there are all these up-and-coming tech hubs that would challenge them,\u201d Terrazas said. \u201cWhat the selection of D.C. and New York underlines is how the dominant players continue to be dominant.\u201d", "TWIN FALLS, Idaho (AP) \u2014 Authorities say one man was killed and another was injured during a tree trimming accident on Tuesday.\n\nCassia County Detective Kevin Horak told The Times-News that 28-year-old Corbin Bowers was killed and 26-year-old Emmett Koyle was hospitalized in critical condition for his injuries.\n\nThe two men from Burley were trimming a tree near the community of Jackson when the accident occurred.

I don\u2019t rule anything out, absolutely not.\u201d\n\nSo, after initial pause when he was offered the job, Punk took the leap into broadcasting for a promotion that was founded in 2006 and helped launch the career of Kimbo Slice and current UFC fighters Paul Felder and Jim Miller. Led by President Rob Haydak, CFFC has become one of the more prominent developmental MMA organizations in the industry. It\u2019s the type of organization that perhaps Punk would have benefited from had he become an MMA pro earlier in his career.\n\n\u201cI did things backward,\u201d Punk said, with a laugh. \u201cI jumped in the deep end. But everybody\u2019s path is different. I do think there needs to be a feeder system where people can get their feet wet.\u201d\n\nWith a third UFC fight out of reach, Punk said he had no regrets about the gutsy transition from wrestling to fighting.\n\n\u201cI was presented with an opportunity that, if I was talking to you today and didn\u2019t do, I\u2019d regret,\u201d Punk said. \u201cI absolutely do not regret my decision one bit.\u201d\n\nPunk, who held the WWE championship for 434 days before an acrimonious split with the company, could be funny and ferocious on the mic. His promos helped him rise on the card and soar in popularity with fans as much as his \u201cbest in the world\u201d talent. He dabbled in commentary on WWE shows (\u201dlook at her jumping around !\u201d he said of future wife AJ Lee) and his comfort in front of the camera helped with his transition into acting.\n\nPunk found bliss as a comic book author and co-hosted the Netflix obstacle course competition show \u201cUltimate Beastmaster.\u201d\n\nYet, five years \u2014 and one nasty, victorious lawsuit \u2014 later, Punk is still remembered by wrestling fans who chant his name at WWE live events.\n\n\u201cYou stop it and five years later people still talk about you? Fans still chant your name? That\u2019s powerful to me,\u201d Punk said.\n\nHe waded back into the sports entertainment world when he made a rare autograph signing in September before a major independent wrestling show that sparked rumors he would lace up the boots one more time. Punk continued to rule out a wrestling comeback.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t pay attention,\u201d Punk said. \u201cPeople seem to get upset when I say that.\u201d\n\nBut they can still catch him in combat sports, where he\u2019s prepping to scrutinize fights, and at Roufusport MMA Academy where he continues to train should another fight arise.\n\n\u201cY\u2019all can\u2019t get rid of me,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "FILE - In this Nov. 6, 2018, file photo, Republican U.S. Rep.

Love has cut into Democratic challenger Ben McAdams' lead as vote-counting continues in the race that remains too close to call a week after Election Day. (AP Photo/Rick Bowmer, File)\n\nSALT LAKE CITY (AP) \u2014 Republican U.S. Rep. Mia Love sued Wednesday to halt vote counting in the Utah race where she is trailing her Democratic challenger by a razor-thin margin, saying her campaign must be allowed to issue challenges if they dispute the validity of mail-in ballots.\n\nIn a contest where \u201cevery single vote is crucial,\u201d the Love campaign claimed poll-watchers have seen a few cases where voter signatures on ballots accepted by election workers did not appear to match those on file in Democratic-leaning Salt Lake County.\n\nCounty attorneys pushed back in court documents, arguing state law gives the campaign no right to interrupt the vote count, and letting the campaign question signatures could violate voters\u2019 rights by revealing who they cast their ballots for.\n\nDemocratic challenger Ben McAdams, meanwhile, said the lawsuit \u201csmacks of desperation,\u201d and elections officials, not candidates, should decide what votes should count.\n\nLove\u2019s campaign is \u201cnot accusing anyone of anything,\u201d but they believe a few instances deserve more scrutiny, campaign attorney Robert Harrington said in a statement. Voting is done primarily by mail in Utah.\n\nCounty Clerk Sherrie Swenson, a Democrat, said Love\u2019s campaign staff was granted access to observe the tallies but is not allowed to be interactive participants in the signature verification process. Results her office released Wednesday night sliced into McAdam\u2019s lead, putting Love less than half a percentage point behind him. Her campaign manager Dave Hansen cheered the news, saying she is on a \u201cpath to victory.\u201d\n\nA judge is set to hear arguments on Thursday.\n\nMcAdams is leading Love by less than 900 votes as counting continued more than a week after Election Day. He is the mayor of Salt Lake County, where 85 percent of voters in the district live.\n\nPresident Donald Trump called out Love by name in a news conference last week where he bashed some fellow Republicans, saying she and others lost because they didn\u2019t fully embrace him. His comments came despite the outcome of the vote being in doubt.\n\nUtah law allows challenges to a voter\u2019s eligibility if they are suspected of trying to vote in someone else\u2019s name, but it is unclear how that applies to mail-in balloting recently adopted by most counties in the state. Utah Elections Director Justin Lee declined to comment.\n\nLove, who became the first black Republican woman elected to Congress in 2014, argues there must be a process for challenging a signature on an envelope swiftly, since after it\u2019s confirmed the ballot is permanently separated from the envelope to be tabulated. Salt Lake County has signaled it may complete its vote count by Thursday, the suit said.\n\nBut nothing in their petition shows any violation of election law in Salt Lake County, the county said in a motion asking a judge to dismiss the lawsuit.\n\nWhen tabulating mail-in ballots, county elections workers compare signatures to verify a voter\u2019s identity. If a worker decides a voter signature doesn\u2019t match the one on file, the person gets a letter informing them and asks them to sign and return an affidavit confirming their identity.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first lawsuit Swenson\u2019s office has faced from Republicans this election cycle. A few days before the vote, two GOP candidates accused her of failing to send thousands of ballots to voters in a timely manner, but the case was tossed out after a hearing.\n\nA similar lawsuit was filed in New Mexico on Tuesday by a Republican who lost her bid for a U.S. House seat. Yvette Herrell asked a county judge to impound absentee ballots so her campaign could inspect them after the county canvassing board certified that Democrat Xochitl Torres Small had won.\n\n__\n\nAssociated Press writer Brady McCombs contributed to this report.", "If Flacco can\u2019t go, Jackson and RG3 ready to roll for Ravens\n\nFILE - In this Nov. 4, 2018, file photo ,Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson (8) rushes the ball in the first half of an NFL football game against the Pittsburgh Steelers in Baltimore.

(AP Photo/Nick Wass, File)\n\nOWINGS MILLS, Md. (AP) \u2014 Lamar Jackson isn\u2019t staying awake at night thinking about the prospect of making his first NFL start.\n\nBaltimore Ravens starting quarterback Joe Flacco missed practice Wednesday because of a hip injury, and his status for Sunday\u2019s game against the Cincinnati Bengals is uncertain.\n\nIf Flacco can\u2019t go, coach John Harbaugh likely will turn to Jackson, whose first pro season thus far has been spent taking a few snaps per game in run situations.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going into it just like any other week. Just preparing for whatever,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cEverything is still the same.\u201d\n\nStarting at quarterback for a team desperate to end a three-game skid might cause some rookies to squirm, but Jackson insisted he\u2019s sleeping \u201clike a baby.\u201d\n\nFlacco hurt his hip early in a 23-16 loss to Pittsburgh on Nov. 4. He had the bye week to recover, but is still receiving treatment, meaning his availability for Baltimore (4-5) against the Bengals (5-4) could come down to a game-time decision.\n\nHarbaugh appears done talking about it.\n\n\u201cRather than tip my toe in the water and start answering one question and then not answering the next one, I\u2019m just not going to get into it. I\u2019m just going to leave it alone,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like we don\u2019t owe anybody any answers.\u201d\n\nIf Flacco can\u2019t play, veteran Robert Griffin III will likely serve as backup to the rookie he\u2019s been mentoring since summer. Griffin, like Jackson, was a running quarterback who had to make the transition into a passing league.\n\nGriffin won the Heisman Trophy as a junior at Baylor and finished with 2,254 yards rushing with 33 touchdowns. Jackson won the Heisman in 2016 and finished with 4,132 yards on the ground with 50 touchdowns.\n\nNow they\u2019re together in Baltimore, trying to get the Ravens into the postseason.\n\n\u201cEverybody wants to be a part of a winner,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cThis franchise has done a lot of winning; we just got to make sure that we get back to that.\u201d\n\nAfter sitting out last season, Griffin launched his comeback by signing in April with the Ravens, presumably to be Flacco\u2019s backup. He dropped to No. 3 on the depth chart soon after Baltimore traded up to get Jackson in the first round.\n\nThough he has 41 career starts (including playoffs), Griffin will likely serve as a backup Sunday if Flacco can\u2019t play. At least he will be in uniform after spending the first nine weeks on the inactive list.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t been OK not playing,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cI think if I was OK not playing, then I wouldn\u2019t be the competitor that I\u2019ve grown to be. But within that, you have to control what you can.\u201d\n\nHe will do what he\u2019s asked on Sunday, but makes no secret of his desire to start.\n\n\u201cIt would be awesome,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a heck of a journey, but coming here was the best thing I could\u2019ve done. Knowing what it means to play like a Raven and growing with these guys has been something that\u2019s been real special for me. If I get that opportunity to go out there and play, I\u2019m going to make most of it and show these guys not only how hard I\u2019ve been working, but how much I believe in them.\u201d\n\nGriffin wants to win, and his main contribution toward that end has been to make the 21-year-old Jackson a better quarterback.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been great. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be a big brother at 28,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cI\u2019ve got two older sisters, I\u2019m the baby of the family, but it\u2019s been great to take Lamar under my wing and kind of be that big-brother figure to him.

When we think regionally, we seldom think of the water-logged Caribbean islands just miles away from us, and that are the real front lines of this region\u2019s climate-change manifestations.\n\nConsider this: If the Bahamas, Jamaica, Aruba, the Virgin Islands are inundated by rising oceans, water heated by climate change, where will all those residents flee to seek shelter? South Florida, most likely.\n\nNov. 11 marks the launch of a smart major campaign by the United Nations Economic and Social Council, which has adopted the idea \u2014 with added urgency \u2014 of helping create a climate change survival blueprint for the Caribbean.\n\nThe effort is being led by Inga Rhonda King, president of the council who hails from the islands of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. ...\n\nKing says the Caribbean islands near Florida have yet to unite, organize and act as one in dealing with climate change. There is no pact in place for the string of islands, which rely heavily on tourism to survive.\n\n\u201cEither we sink together or build climate resilience. There is no other option,\u201d King said. \u201cThe time to talk is over, the time to act is now.\u201d She\u2019s right.\n\nKing wants to ring the bell loudly with this campaign \u2014 and she has hard numbers to allude to the looming devastation. Last year, climate-related worldwide disasters caused $320 billion in damage, wiping out decades of development gains in some places. For the Caribbean, the island chains\u2019 very existence is at stake.\n\nEconomically, it has long been a tourism magnet and source of revenue. ...\n\nKing told the Miami Herald Editorial Board that the Caribbean needs to catch up to neighbors like Florida \u2014 or else.\n\n...\n\nEven though King and the Caribbean nations have not asked, maybe South Florida can volunteer to help. The Southeast Florida Regional Climate Change Compact should consider inviting the Caribbean islands to join in the effort. After all, we all face being overwhelmed by the same Atlantic waters.\n\nWhen that Compact was created, the first thing members did was work out a common set of numbers projecting how much sea-level rise to expect: 6 to 10 inches by 2030; up to 5 feet by 2100. They worked out a regional vulnerability assessment.\n\n...\n\nThe Caribbean needs to create a similar action plan.

While the Florida Department of Transportation is rightly ramping up efforts to reduce these collisions using technology to detect wrong-way drivers, the recent loss of life is a reminder of the perils of impaired driving in a region where the roadways are perpetually under construction and increasingly congested.\n\nIn the stretch of just two weeks this fall, a suspected drunk driver made a U-turn and drove the wrong way on the Howard Frankland bridge, dying when he crashed head-on into a van, critically injuring a St. Petersburg man. Days later, a similar collision on the bridge critically injured a woman. Then a suspected drunk driver going the wrong way on the Lee Roy Selmon Expressway killed 68-year-old Bamnet Narongchai, a mechanic on his way home from a late shift.\n\nYet wrong-way driving \u2014 while it defies common sense \u2014 is actually quite common, a 2014 Tampa Bay Times analysis found. There were 70 incidents of drivers entering highways going the wrong way over the course of eight years in Tampa Bay, and nearly 700 wrong-way driving incidents on local roads in 2014, according to Florida Highway Patrol records. It\u2019s a problem that deserves the state\u2019s attention for changes to infrastructure that would help reduce the number of serious crashes due to wrong-way drivers.\n\nThe Department of Transportation first began to tackle the problem after a wrong-way driver killed himself and four University of South Florida fraternity members on Interstate 275 near campus in 2014, the first of six wrong-way collisions that year. After examining crash data, the department put up red flashing warning signs with radar detection at select ramps to deter wrong-way drivers. Once triggered, an alert is immediately sent to law enforcement officials, and a wrong-way driver alert is broadcast on the electronic message boards along the interstate, according to FDOT spokeswoman Kristen Carson. FDOT has also increased wrong-way signage, roadway reflectors and large painted pavement markings to help make direction of lanes and ramps even clearer. She said the data shows those measures may be working. Numbers dropped from 18 wrong-way driving crashes in the Tampa Bay area in 2016 to seven in 2017.\n\nBut the recent crashes on Howard Frankland bridge illuminate a different problem. Two wrong-way drivers recently made a U-turn in the middle of the bridge. That prompted FDOT to test new video analytics software with its cameras on the bridge to send alerts to the Traffic Management Center, dispatching troopers when there\u2019s a wrong-way driver.\n\nThese are worthwhile changes that can make Tampa Bay highways safer. But law enforcement officials are quick to point out that wrong-way driving is not an engineering issue. It\u2019s a drunk driving issue. In all but one of Tampa Bay\u2019s deadly wrong-way crashes in the last few years, the driver going the wrong way was impaired. With the availability of ride-sharing services and taxis, there\u2019s never an excuse for driving drunk \u2014 and texting while driving is just as dangerous. Only responsible driving will fix this problem. Meanwhile, FDOT\u2019s efforts are a step in the right direction to minimizing the damage wrong-way drivers cause.\n\nOnline: http://www.tampabay.com/\n\n___\n\nNov. 14\n\nThe Florida Times-Union on mental illness awareness:\n\n...\n\nThe Epilepsy Foundation of Florida is trying to combat the lack of knowledge about epilepsy in order to raise awareness, support funding and help those with the disease.\n\nEpilepsy Florida CEO Karen Basha Agozi recently visited the Times-Union Editorial Board to point out this stark reality: while a great deal of work has been done toward treating illnesses like Alzheimer\u2019s and mental illness, epilepsy has too often escaped our focus.\n\nIn contrast to Alzheimer\u2019s, brain surgery sometimes can successfully treat epilepsy.\n\n...\n\nWORLD MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS\n\nA recently released report by a commission of mental health researchers \u2014 put together by the Lancet medical journal \u2014 declared mental illness to be a \u201cglobal health crisis.\u201d\n\nAccording to the report, too many people around the world do not seek treatment or receive poor care for mental illness; in numerous countries, people with mental illnesses are abused, imprisoned or living on the streets.\n\nIn all, according to the report, an estimated 13.5 million people worldwide die needlessly from mental illness each year.\n\nWhile we in the United States consider our nation to be an empathetic one, the uncomfortable fact is treatment for mental illness has been historically underfunded in our country.\n\nJust look at Florida, which traditionally ranks among the worst states in per capita funding for mental health care.

Offensive tackle Jonah Williams is picked by some to be drafted as high as No. 2 after starting all 39 games in his career with the Crimson Tide and earning All-America honors at left tackle last season.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s one of those guys that\u2019s a perfectionist\u201d Alabama coach Nick Saban said. \u201cHe wants to be the best player and he\u2019s one of the guys that\u2019s willing to do the things that you have to do to be the best player.\u201d\n\nOther possible first-round picks from Alabama include defensive tackle Quinnen Williams, safety Deionte Thompson, defensive lineman Raekwon Davis, linebacker Mack Wilson and running back Damien Harris.\n\nLSU has two top-20 prospects in cornerback Greedy Williams and linebacker Devin White. Williams led the SEC with six interceptions as a redshirt freshman last season and has two interceptions and 28 tackles and has defended eight passes this year. White ranked first in the country with 96 assisted tackles last season and has 89 tackles, including seven for losses, a forced fumble and two fumble recoveries this year.\n\nKentucky hasn\u2019t had a player taken in the past two drafts with the Wildcats\u2019 most recent draft pick coming when Josh Forrest was selected by the Rams in the sixth round in 2016. Their drought should end this year with outside linebacker Josh Allen expected to be chosen in the first round. If he is, it will give the Wildcats a first-round pick for the first time since Bud Dupree was selected by the Steelers with the 22nd overall pick in the 2015 draft.\n\nKentucky coach Mark Stoops isn\u2019t shy about bragging about his star player and called him the: \u201cbest defensive player in the country,\u201d on his radio show last month.\n\nAllen, who is a senior, leads the SEC in tackles for losses (16) and sacks (11) and his five forced fumbles lead the nation. The 6-foot-5, 260-pound Allen has 65 tackles and has recovered two fumbles.\n\nMississippi could have two first-round picks with offensive lineman Greg Little and wide receiver A.J. Brown both projected to be top-25 selections. The Rebels entered the season with three first-round prospects, but receiver D.K. Metcalf could choose to return for another season after suffering a season-ending neck injury which required surgery last month.\n\nBrown\u2019s 72 receptions and 1,047 yards receiving both lead the SEC and he\u2019s had five 100-yard receiving games this season, including three in a row. The 6-1, 225 pound Brown became the school\u2019s all-time leading receiver in a loss to Texas A&M on Saturday. He has 2,711 yards receiving to move in front of Shay Hodge, who had 2,646 yards receiving from 2006-09.\n\n\u201cBeen around a lot of great receivers here at Ole Miss, for him to be the all-time leading receiver, that\u2019s a pretty special accomplishment for him,\u201d Mississippi coach Matt Luke said. \u201cHe\u2019s been very unselfish, playing inside, playing outside. He\u2019s very versatile. That will do nothing but help him going forward, his ability to do a bunch of different things.\u201d\n\nGeorgia, which had three first-round picks selected in the 2018 draft, could have another one next year in cornerback Deandre Baker. He flirted with the draft last offseason before returning for his senior year and has two interceptions and leads the SEC with nine passes defended.\n\nMississippi State has two defensive linemen who are among the best in the nation and could both be first-round draft picks. Jeffery Simmons, a 6-4, 300-pound tackle, is a three-year starter whose 12\u00bd tackles for losses rank fourth in the SEC. Simmons has 27\u00bd tackles for losses and five sacks and has piled up 148 tackles in his career.\n\nMontez Sweat is a defensive end who led the SEC with 16 tackles for losses and 11 sacks last season. This year he also ranks high on the SEC charts and is fourth with 13 tackles for losses and second with 10 sacks.\n\nAt Missouri, two offensive stars could be selected in the first round in 2019. Tight end Albert Okwuegbunam led the SEC with 11 touchdown receptions last season and is fourth this year with six TD grabs and has 466 yards receiving. His quarterback Drew Lock could join him as a first-round pick after a four-year career where he\u2019s thrown for 11,342 yards and 92 touchdowns with just 39 interceptions.\n\nLock led the nation with 44 touchdown passes last season and ranks second in the SEC this year with 21 TD tosses. He has thrown for 2,647 yards which also ranks second.\n\nFlorida has a top-10 draft prospect in defensive lineman Jachai Polite. The junior is third in the country with four forced fumbles and his 12\u00bd tackles for losses and 7\u00bd sacks are both No. 4 in the SEC.\n\nDefensive tackle Derrick Brown could be the first player from Auburn taken in the first round since the Tigers had two first-rounders in 2014. Brown has 9\u00bd tackles for losses and 3\u00bd sacks this season and has 20 tackles for losses and 8 sacks in three years at Auburn.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football coverage: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "FILE - In this Oct. 31, 2018 file photo, Andy Kim, the Democratic candidate in the U.S. Congressional District 3 race, speaks during a debate against Republican candidate Tom MacArthur, in Newark, N.J.

He faced jeers and insults from constituents during an at-times raucous town hall about health care last year.\n\nHe authored an amendment to allow states to get federal waivers to the requirement that insurers charge healthy and sick customers the same premiums. The change, which didn\u2019t pass the Senate, would have been for people who let their coverage lapse. MacArthur had said those people would be covered by high-risk pools.\n\nIn a recent interview, Kim said that was a turning point.\n\n\u201cThe moment that was most important in this district over the last two years was the health care vote and the town hall that MacArthur did,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was what got me into the race, that\u2019s what just turned this district on its head and why people got so fired up.\u201d\n\nKim largely stayed away from invoking the president, despite his unpopularity in New Jersey.\n\nAP VoteCast found that most people said that Trump was a factor in their vote, while a majority also said the country is headed in the wrong direction.

(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)\n\nBALTIMORE (AP) \u2014 U.S. Catholic bishops made clear their frustrations Wednesday as a national assembly focused on clergy sex-abuse neared its conclusion without strong new steps to combat the multifaceted crisis.\n\nAvoiding any direct confrontation with the Vatican, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops ended the public sessions of its three-day meeting without any vote on two major anti-abuse proposals that had been drafted weeks ago. On the eve of this week\u2019s meeting, the Vatican issued a surprise order for such action to be delayed until after a global meeting on sex abuse scheduled for February.\n\n\u201cThe decision of the Holy See to constrain us did allow a limited response,\u201d Bishop Christopher Coyne of Burlington, Vermont said. \u201cAll of us are disappointed that we weren\u2019t able to do as much as we wanted.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Catholic church has been grappling with sex-abuse scandals for many years, but events this year have taken a heavy toll on the leadership\u2019s credibility.\n\nIn August, a grand jury report in Pennsylvania detailed decades of abuse and cover-up in six dioceses, alleging more than 1,000 children had been abused over the years by about 300 priests. Since then, federal prosecutors and attorneys general in several other states have launched investigations.\n\nBishops at this week\u2019s meeting appeared to be most angered and embarrassed by the scandal involving disgraced church leader Theodore McCarrick, who allegedly abused and harassed youths and seminarians over many years as he rose to be archbishop of Washington and a member of the College of Cardinals until his removal by Pope Francis in July.\n\nSeveral investigations, including one at the Vatican, are underway to determine who might have known about and covered up McCarrick\u2019s alleged misconduct. The U.S. bishops expressed eagerness to learn details of the Vatican probe but defeated a motion Wednesday pressing for access to information uncovered in that process.\n\n\u201cWe have taken no official action to distance ourselves form the shameful behavior of one of our own,\u201d said Bishop Liam Cary, of Baker, Oregon. \u201cWhat do people make of our silence?\u201d\n\nBishop Michael Olson, of Fort Worth, Texas, noted with regret that McCarrick has not been defrocked and would have been eligible to participate in this week\u2019s assembly.\n\n\u201cHe is not welcome,\u201d Olson said. \u201cWe should say that for his sake, and out of respect for those he has harmed.\u201d\n\nFor much of Wednesday\u2019s session, the bishops discussed the two anti-abuse proposals that initially had been scheduled for votes. One would establish a new code of conduct for individual bishops; the other would create a nine-member special commission, including six lay experts and three members of the clergy, to review complaints against the bishops.\n\nLeaders of the conference said the Vatican intervened to ensure that steps taken by the U.S. bishops would be in harmony with those decided at a Vatican-convened global meeting on sex abuse in February. They also said more time was needed to vet aspects of the U.S. proposals that might conflict with church law.\n\nThe head of the bishops\u2019 conference, Cardinal Daniel DiNardo of the Galveston-Houston Archdiocese, said a newly formed sex-abuse task force would work on fine-tuning those and other proposals ahead of the global meeting in Rome in February. One proposed step will be a national mechanism for publishing the names of clergy who face substantiated claims of abuse.\n\n\u201cI opened this meeting expressing some disappointment \u2014 I end the meeting with hope,\u201d DiNardo said. \u201cWe leave this place committed to take the strongest possible action at the earliest possible moment.\u201d\n\nIn other action, the bishops approved a pastoral letter condemning racism, the first time they have spoken as a group on that issue since 1979.\n\n\u201cEvery racist act \u2014 every such comment, every joke, every disparaging look as a reaction to the color of skin, ethnicity or place of origin \u2014 is a failure to acknowledge another person as a brother or sister, created in the image of God,\u201d the document said.\n\nIt also denounced racial profiling of Hispanics and African-Americans and decried \u201cthe growing fear and harassment\u201d of people from Muslim countries.\n\nAccording to Catholic News Service, the committee responsible for the pastoral letter rejected a proposed amendment that would have included the Confederate flag as a symbol of hate, along with nooses and swastikas.\n\nThe bishops also voted to endorse a campaign seeking sainthood for Sister Thea Bowman, a Mississippi-born descendant of slaves who became the first black member of the Franciscan Sisters of Perpetual Adoration and \u2014 in 1989 \u2014 the first black woman to address a national meeting of the bishops\u2019 conference.\n\nAmong the bishops elected to USCCB posts was Archbishop Salvatore Cordileone of San Francisco, who will head the Committee on Laity, Marriage, Family Life and Youth. Cordileone, an outspoken opponent of same-sex marriage, suggested Tuesday that the bishops commission a new study on whether there\u2019s a link between clergy sex abuse and the presence of gays in the priesthood. A church-commissioned study in 2004 determined there was not a link.\n\nNot far from the assembly venue, a Minnesota attorney who handles sex abuse cases nationwide and three men who say they were abused by clergy during their boyhoods gathered to announce a lawsuit against the bishops conference, accusing it of hiding the crimes of predator priests.\n\nJeff Anderson, who filed the lawsuit this week in federal court in Minnesota, said the bishops were named because their dioceses kept secret files about clergy whose misconduct might expose the church to more abuse accusations.\n\n\u201cWe are taking the opportunity to do everything we can together to protect kids, to disgorge the secrets,\u201d Anderson said.\n\nThe federal lawsuit demanding a trial by jury has six plaintiffs; three joined Anderson in Baltimore.\n\nAmong then was Joseph McLean, of Minneapolis. The priest he says abused him decades ago was publicly named as a \u201ccredibly accused\u201d offender in 2015 by the Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis.\n\n\u201cI am here to protect kids today. I\u2019m here to protect kids tomorrow. And I\u2019m here to protect children who have grown into adults and who haven\u2019t had an opportunity to heal from the abuse that they suffered,\u201d McLean said.\n\n___\n\nCrary reported from New York.", "AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) \u2014 A Maine man who blinded himself by gouging his own eyes last year at the Maine State Prison has died.\n\nThe Kennebuc Journal reports no information has been released on how 67-year-old James Staples died at a South Carolina health facility.

Solid judicial decisions played a role, too, particularly the court-ordered redrawing of a gerrymandered congressional map that had favored Republicans. And years earlier, the overturning of a restrictive voter ID law.\n\nThis is progress, but Pennsylvania still trails many states in voter access. Early voting would help bring the state into the 21st century. (If you waited in a long line in the rain on Tuesday, you might want to send a follow-up message to your state representative and senator. In Harrisburg, bills to allow early voting die in committee.)\n\nPennsylvania\u2019s idea of early voting is by absentee ballot \u2014 but you\u2019ve to mail in a sworn statement that you\u2019re disabled or going to be out of town on Election Day.\n\nThirty-seven states extend some form of early voting. New Jersey, for example, allows no-excuse absentee voting, and lets people vote early in person at voter registration sites, for 45 days before an election.\n\nWhat else? Same-day registration would be a step forward, along with easier ballot access for third-party candidates. And open primaries.\n\nA predicted blue wave of Democratic fervor didn\u2019t sweep through every corner Pennsylvania last week, but a statewide rebalancing took hold.\n\nIn January, the state\u2019s congressional delegation will be perfectly purple \u2014 nine Republicans and nine Democrats, a dramatic change from the gerrymandered results of the last decade. That imbalance, enabled by a Republican governor and Legislature, helped to elect 13 Republicans to Congress, even though Democrats turned out in higher numbers overall.\n\nPennsylvania played a leading role in turning the U.S. House of Representatives to a Democratic majority. The state saw an unprecedented number of women candidates, including Democrat Susan Wild, who captured the Lehigh Valley\u2019s newly drawn 7th District.\n\nIt\u2019s notable that Wild won by 15,000 votes in the new 7th district, which reunited the Lehigh Valley. Republican Marty Nothstein, by a razor-thin margin, appears to have won the race to serve the final two months of former Rep. Charlie Dent\u2019s term in the old 15th District. That district was gerrymandered to protect Dent after the 2010 census.\n\nRepublicans still ran strong, and won, in Republican-dominated areas of the state.\n\nThat\u2019s the way it\u2019s supposed to work.\n\nStill, Pennsylvania voters sent a message in re-electing U.S. Sen. Bob Casey, as New Jersey voters did in returning ethically challenged Sen. Robert Menendez to Washington.\n\nPennsylvanians opted for a split state government again, choosing Gov. Tom Wolf as a hedge against legislative Republicans, who retained majorities in both houses.\n\nThe rancorous segregation of Americans into red and blue camps isn\u2019t going away, and it won\u2019t be helped by selectively limiting voter access \u2014 as North Dakota did in making voting difficult for native Americans. A town in Kansas moved a polling site out of town. Georgia and other states have opted for aggressive purging of registration rolls.\n\nIt falls to the courts, in many cases, to point out partisan overload. Witness the federal court decision last week to toss Maryland\u2019s congressional map. It had been sliced and diced, a panel of judges said, to help elect Democrats.\n\nThat\u2019s the way it\u2019s supposed to work.\n\n__ The Easton Express-Times\n\n__ Online: https://bit.ly/2RQUmiY\n\n___\n\nEXPEDITE ASYLUM REQUESTS, Nov. 14\n\nPresident Donald Trump is correct in the strong stand he is taking against the pileup of immigrants seeking to get into and stay in the United States. Some 800,000 asylum applications are pending in the immigration court system, and the backlog is growing.\n\nAt current rates, it will take years to wear it down. But Mr. Trump proposes to solve the problem the wrong way.\n\nHe should not plan to erect \u201cmassive\u201d tent camps to hold people while they await their asylum decisions. This will lead to inhumane conditions and probably a permanent population of taxpayer-dependent people living in refugee status on American soil.\n\nWe need a ramped-up court system to handle these applications in the interest of prompt justice. Perversely, the interminable delays in handling asylum applications may work to encourage asylum seekers, who generally get to remain in this country awaiting their day in court.\n\nAnd the specter of massive camps of immigrants living for free on American taxpayers while doing nothing but becoming embittered about their status is the kind of image that will feed the anti-immigrant anger of many Republican voters, many for years to come.\n\nMr. Trump didn\u2019t choose the timing of the caravan that is making its way here from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador. The marchers and whoever is organizing and assisting their trek did that.\n\nThe president has done the right thing in sending strong signals that the United States will not lower its standards for granting asylum, and people should not expect to win asylum unless their cases meet established standards. The result is that the caravan has greatly diminished in size.\n\nThe president must avoid actions that overstate the situation, or threaten constitutional liberties, as he did with an extremely inappropriate proposed executive order to countermand the 14th Amendment to the Constitution that guarantees citizenship to anyone born on U.S. soil.\n\nThe solution is to crank up the court system rapidly to quickly process the backlog of asylum seekers. At the same time, the United States has an obligation to engage with the governments of Central America to correct policies that are driving people away from their homeland.\n\n__ The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\n\n__ Online: https://bit.ly/2qNQSCw\n\n___\n\nKEEP MOVING FULL STEAM AHEAD, Nov. 14\n\nIt was exhilarating last week to see such engagement from voters.\n\nThe electorate came out in droves, not only across the state and country, but locally. Estimates show that the percentage of voters in each of Fayette, Greene, Westmoreland and Washington counties who made their voices heard surpassed the percentage of those who showed up nationally and across Pennsylvania.\n\nIt should be a moment of pride across our local counties, where voter turnout hasn\u2019t always been extraordinary.\n\nElection bureau directors from each of the four counties said turnout was above 50 percent (the lowest was Fayette at 53.2 percent). Westmoreland County, where there are nearly a quarter of a million registered voters, had a turnout of 59.4 percent. Rewind six months to the May primary and you\u2019ll find that turnout in Fayette and Westmoreland didn\u2019t crack 20 percent.\n\nThe turnout locally surprised even the most seasoned election bureau directors, some of whom said they\u2019ve never seen that type of turnout for a midterm election.\n\nNationwide, according to the United States Election Project, 49.2 percent of those eligible to vote made their voices heard. Pennsylvania\u2019s overall percentage was 50 percent, according to the organization.\n\nMidterm elections, i.e. those for U.S. House and U.S. Senate that fall between presidential elections, don\u2019t always bring a lot of excitement. The state\u2019s overall turnout in 2014 was 36 percent and in 2010 it was 42.4 percent.\n\nThat the nationwide turnout nearly cracked 50 percent might feel like a \u201cbig whoop\u201d moment to some. Without a doubt, the number still isn\u2019t where it should be.\n\nHowever, the last time such a high percentage turned out for a midterm election was 52 years ago, according to numbers from the United States Election Project, but at the time, the legal voting age was still 21.\n\nSo yes, to one of every two voters coming out on Nov. 6, we say, \u201cThat\u2019s amazing.\u201d\n\nBut we must feed that sense of civic duty and foster it so that it grows during next year\u2019s municipal elections, where we\u2019ll nominate and then choose candidates for county, city, borough and township offices. Among those up for election are commissioners \u2014 the group of three who will lead our counties. Mayors, council members, township supervisors, magisterial district judges and other county-level row offices will also be up for grabs.\n\nThe people elected to those offices might not make the same headlines as those in state and federal ones, but they impact the daily lives of the residents they serve.\n\nAt the polls last week, a Uniontown woman told one of our reporters that she read an article that said those who vote are usually the ones who are \u201cenraged or engaged.\u201d That leaves elections decided by those who are heavily involved in politics or incensed by the political climate.\n\nAs Nov. 6 proved, you needn\u2019t be in either of those camps to participate.\n\nYou just need to care enough to go.\n\n__ The Herald-Standard\n\n__ Online: https://bit.ly/2z9C99I\n\n___\n\nPOCONO RACEWAY AIR SHOW WRONG TO FEATURE RE-ENACTMENT OF PEARL HARBOR, Nov. 11\n\nDon\u2019t get us wrong.\n\nWe love a good show just as much as the next person.\n\nBut a recent announcement about an air show at Pocono Raceway has left us wondering just what in the world officials at the track are thinking.\n\nIn case you haven\u2019t heard, as reported on our website and by other area media Thursday night, the Great Pocono Raceway Air Show is going to have a host of entertainment on Aug. 24 and 25 next year.\n\nOf course, their will be airplanes, displays, vendors and even something called the \u201cFan Fair,\u201d which promises kid-friendly entertainment.\n\nBut it\u2019s the grand finale of the show that has turned our stomachs.\n\nA group called Tora! Tora! Tora! is coming to the Long Pond race track. (If the name of the group doesn\u2019t ring a bell, you need to go back to your eighth grade history class.)\n\nIn case you haven\u2019t heard or figured it out yet, Tora! Tora! Tora! will be performing an historic re-enactment of the bombing of Pearl Harbor, with up to 12 replica Japanese planes.\n\nIsn\u2019t that just wonderful? In case you miss the sarcasm, we don\u2019t think it\u2019s wonderful. In fact, it\u2019s downright offensive to those who gave their lives on that fateful day.\n\nLet\u2019s forget for a moment that there isn\u2019t a harbor anywhere in Long Pond that could hold the 16 U.S. Navy ships that were either destroyed or damaged during the actual attack.\n\nWe are sure the 2,000-foot wall of fire promised during the performance will more than make up for a lack of a deep-water port.\n\nWe\u2019re not sure, however, if that wall of fire is supposed to represent the torpedoes that caused the USS Oklahoma to capsize, trapping many of its crew inside, or if it is an ode to the bomb that struck the USS Arizona\u2019s magazine, sending it to the bottom and claiming 1,177 officers and crewmen.\n\nQuite simply, we can\u2019t believe that anyone would think re-enacting an attack that killed 2,403 Americans and wounded another 1,143 is appropriate.\n\nMay be we are just a little too sensitive.\n\nThe Tora! Tora! Tora!\u2019s website says it has been re-enacting the attack since 1972. It says it\u2019s a \u201cmemorial to all the soldiers on both sides who gave their lives for their countries.\u201d\n\nWell then, we just hope that the 15 sailors that died on the USS Pennsylvania as it was hit while in dry dock are properly honored.\n\nActually, race track officials should just reconsider their decision and pass on hosting the Tora! Tora! Tora! group and the re-enactment.\n\n\u201cThe motto of the Commemorative Air Force and the \u2018Tora\u2019 act is \u2018Lest We Forget.\u2019 \u2018Tora, Tora, Tora,\u2019 as other Commemorative Air Force flying history recreations, is not intended to promote nationalism or glorify war. The intent of the Tora group is to help generations of individuals throughout the world born after World War II understand that war does not discriminate in the pain it causes and that courageous individuals on both sides lose their lives,\u201d the group\u2019s website says.\n\nA lofty goal. But excuse of us if we believe the only thing that anyone is going to learn at this show is that planes can drop things that blow up.\n\nWe hardly believe that this is what Franklin D. Roosevelt meant when he said Dec. 7, 1941, was \u201ca day that will live in infamy.\u201d\n\n__ The Times Leader\n\n__ Online: https://bit.ly/2DnNIgp\n\n___\n\nACTION NEEDED NOW TO PROTECT MUELLER PROBE, Nov. 8\n\nFormer Attorney General Jeff Sessions had long been rumored to be on the postelection chopping block, so the announcement Wednesday that he had been forced out \u2014 finally \u2014 came as something less than a shock.\n\nThe timing, a little less so.\n\nThat President Donald Trump would wait less than 24 hours after the polls closed to offload his beleaguered AG was a reflection both of how eager he was to pull the trigger, and how incensed he was at the outcome of Tuesday\u2019s elections.\n\nThe capture of the House by Democrats this week puts Trump in the crosshairs of legitimate political accountability for the first time in his presidency, and he seemed eager to deflect attention from that fact, which he did by demanding Sessions\u2019 resignation.\n\nIf Sessions has a shred of self-decency left, he should have been only too glad to submit it. After all, Trump has pilloried his hand-picked AG mercilessly for more than a year since the latter committed the mortal sin (in Trump\u2019s eyes) or recusing himself from any investigations into the Trump campaign\u2019s possible cooperation with Russian efforts to influence the 2016 presidential elections.\n\nSessions\u2019 recusal led to the hiring of special counselor Robert Mueller, which led to the largest cloud over Trump: An ongoing probe that has already generated scores of charges, as well as half a dozen guilty pleas from several close Trump associates, including his former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, longtime personal attorney Michael Cohen and short-tenured National Security Advisor Michael Flynn.\n\nWhich brings us to this week.\n\nIn forcing out Sessions, Trump did not name the agency\u2019s second-in-command, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, to assume his duties. Leapfrogging over Rosenstein was Sessions\u2019 chief of staff, Matthew Whitaker, who now assumes oversight of the Mueller probe.\n\nUnlike Rosenstein, who had been Mueller\u2019s boss owing to Sessions\u2019 recusal, Whitaker is not on record as a defender of the special counsel. Just the opposite, in fact. He has, in his past role as a political commentator, questioned the latitude of the probe and has said it should be constrained. He even described how that could be done financially, by squeezing or outright defunding Mueller\u2019s office.\n\nNo surprise, then, that leading Democrats are calling for Whitaker to recuse himself from any role in the investigation. Fat chance of that. Trump is no Rhodes scholar, but he isn\u2019t dumb enough to make the same mistake twice of appointing an AG (acting or otherwise) with recusal plans.\n\nAll of which is why the Senate needs to act \u2014 and quickly.\n\nA bipartisan bill that would shield Mueller\u2019s investigation has already been approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee and need only be called to the floor by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\nMcConnell, in the past, has said the Mueller probe should proceed to its conclusion but that he did not think it needed legislative protection because it was not threatened. That is no longer the case.\n\nWith the probe now under the auspices of an acting attorney general who is on record as hostile to its scope, if not its very existence, lawmakers cannot respond quickly enough.\n\nMcConnell, sitting on his two Supreme Court judges and his about-to-expand majority, must now act in the best interest of country rather than party.\n\nIf not, Democrats, weakened though they be, ought not to shy away from using upcoming budget negotiations to force the issue.\n\nThe American public needs to know how and to what extent Russian adversaries meddled in the run-up to the 2016 presidential elections. The Mueller probe has uncovered no small amount of malfeasance already. It must be allowed to continue to its conclusion, wherever that may lead.\n\n__ The York Dispatch\n\n__ Online: https://bit.ly/2B7RyZp", "PHILADELPHIA (AP) \u2014 A retired Philadelphia police officer has been indicted by a federal grand jury on a charge of deprivation of rights after a woman alleged he sexually assaulted her for 90 minutes in his police car while he was on duty.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney\u2019s office announced the indictment of retired officer Thomas O\u2019Neill Wednesday related to the alleged July 2016 assault.

(AP) \u2014 U.S. Sen. John Kennedy called Wednesday on Louisiana\u2019s health secretary to resign after an audit said her agency may have spent as much as $85 million on Medicaid coverage for people who weren\u2019t eligible since Gov. John Bel Edwards expanded the government-financed program.\n\nThe Republican senator said Rebekah Gee, an appointee of the Democratic governor, didn\u2019t show respect for taxpayer dollars and shouldn\u2019t be able to maintain her position.\n\n\u201cActions ought to have consequences. If this was in the private sector, Dr. Gee would have been fired an hour after that report,\u201d said Kennedy, who is considering a run against Edwards in the 2019 election.\n\nEdwards spokesman Richard Carbo dismissed Kennedy\u2019s criticisms as \u201canother one of Sen. Kennedy\u2019s baseless soundbites brought about by having too much free time in Washington.\u201d\n\nThe governor has \u201cfull confidence\u201d in Gee, Carbo said. He said the Medicaid expansion program under Gee\u2019s watch has cut Louisiana\u2019s uninsured rate in half, and he described new technology the health department launched this week aimed at improving Medicaid eligibility verification.\n\nLegislative Auditor Daryl Purpera\u2019s office says since Edwards expanded the Medicaid program in July 2016, the department has relied on recipients to self-report changes in their paychecks in the 12-month period between the initial application for Medicaid and coverage renewal.\n\nAuditors suggested more frequent checks using available state wage data should be used to ensure Medicaid recipients aren\u2019t earning more than what is allowed to qualify.\n\nPurpera\u2019s office used a random sample of 100 Medicaid recipients in the expansion program, to check if their income exceeded the threshold for eligibility. Projecting those results across the entire expansion population, auditors wrote, suggests the health department spent between $61.6 million and $85.5 million over 20 months on people who weren\u2019t eligible for coverage.\n\n\u201cThe Department of Health just threw the money in the dirt,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cIt is difficult for me to overstate how stunning I found this audit report. Everyone involved should hide their head in a bag.\u201d\n\nThe health department said it follows a federally approved verification plan for checking Medicaid recipients\u2019 income when a person applies for the program and renews coverage yearly. But Gee said her department\u2019s new computer system to double-check eligibility will connect with state and federal databases to have real-time verification of citizenship, income and disability information. If anyone is found to have intentionally misrepresented income levels, that information will be sent to law enforcement agencies for possible prosecution, the agency said.\n\n\u201cThis administration is increasing income verification checks by 400 percent, which will address the long-term problem described in the audit,\u201d Carbo said.\n\nMore than 480,000 working poor and other nonelderly adults in Louisiana are enrolled in Medicaid through the expansion program.

Jackson was fired by the Cleveland Browns last month after he won only three games in three seasons as head coach. (AP Photo/John Minchillo)\n\nCINCINNATI (AP) \u2014 Hue Jackson was talking to reporters outside Paul Brown Stadium when quarterback Andy Dalton yelled at him that practice was about to begin.\n\nJust like old times.\n\nThe former Bengals offensive coordinator is back in town, though this time dabbling in the other side of the playbook \u2014 well, mostly. How that part plays out is an interesting subplot as the Bengals (5-4) make one final push to save their at-risk season.\n\nAn unusual coaching arrangement for desperate times.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a unique situation for a lot of us,\u201d linebacker Preston Brown said.\n\nA 51-14 loss to the Saints \u2014 the third straight game in which Cincinnati has given up 500 yards \u2014 set things in motion. Head coach Marvin Lewis fired defensive coordinator Teryl Austin on Monday and installed himself in the dual role of coach and coordinator.\n\nHe also called his unemployed close friend to see if he was interested in returning for a third stint in Cincinnati as a special assistant on defense. Jackson was fired by the Browns two weeks earlier after winning three games in three seasons.\n\nJackson was hoping the Bengals would reach out to him.\n\n\u201cThis is a tremendous opportunity for me, and I\u2019m just thankful that they said, \u2018You come on home,\u2019\u201d Jackson said.\n\nSo, now what?\n\nLewis built his coaching reputation as a defensive coordinator, directing the Ravens defense that won the Super Bowl in the 2000 season. He\u2019s decided to go back to his roots as a coordinator while also functioning as head coach \u2014 a challenge that few would undertake.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot,\u201d Lewis said Wednesday.\n\nHe spent Tuesday night at home scripting defensive plays. He then led the team meeting on Wednesday morning and presided over the defensive meeting, simplifying things and pulling out a few plays from his past.\n\n\u201cHe had a different PowerPoint,\u201d Brown said. \u201cHe had a really small font, so it was kind of hard to take notes. But it was cool having him up there. You can tell he was having fun.\n\n\u201cWe did a lot of things \u2014 old plays he was calling in 2015, \u201914, stuff I haven\u2019t seen yet. So he was bringing back some plays.\u201d\n\nLewis isn\u2019t sure how it will play out Sunday in Baltimore (4-5), a game the Bengals need to win to stay in the AFC North race. Jackson is providing input for the defensive game plan and will be on the sideline helping Lewis manage the defense, though their game-day roles haven\u2019t been defined.\n\nOne thing is clear: Jackson won\u2019t be dabbling in the offense. Not for now, anyway.\n\nAsked if Jackson would do anything with the offense, Lewis said emphatically, \u201cNo. Separate from the offense.\u201d\n\nJackson was the Bengals\u2019 offensive coordinator when Dalton had his best season in 2015. He left to take Cleveland\u2019s head coaching job after the season. His return could create an awkward dynamic on the coaching staff.\n\nJackson said that offensive coordinator Bill Lazor came to his office at Paul Brown Stadium to greet him. Jackson said he\u2019d be glad to offer an opinion if Lazor asks, but he\u2019s going to be careful not to trespass on other coaches\u2019 areas.\n\nHe knows that adding a newcomer midseason can work both ways.\n\n\u201cIt can be impactful, but it can also hurt, too,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cAnd I get that. I just have to play my role, to the best of my ability. I don\u2019t want to do anything to upset anything that they have going on here. But at the same time if I can help, I do want to help.\u201d\n\nA DOZEN INJURED\n\nSeven players were held out of practice because of injuries Wednesday and five more were limited. The defense has been hit particularly hard.\n\nLB Preston Brown (knee), CB Dre Kirkpatrick (concussion), LB Nick Vigil (knee) and DT Adolphus Washington (knee) didn\u2019t practice. LB Vontaze Burfict (hip), CB Darqueze Dennard (shoulder) and LB Vincent Rey (groin) were limited.\n\nWR A.J. Green is out indefinitely with an injured toe. WR John Ross was limited because of a groin injury.\n\nSTADIUM UPDATE\n\nThe Bengals and Hamilton Country agreed in principle Wednesday on a plan to add parking and a music venue outside Paul Brown Stadium, and to repair and upgrade the 19-year-old stadium. The Bengals retain the right to build a cover over one of their adjacent practice fields, though they would have to pay for it. The team said there are no immediate plans to cover a field. The Bengals use the University of Cincinnati\u2019s covered field on wintry days.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz, right, looks to pass as offensive tackle Halapoulivaati Vaitai, left, tries to block Dallas Cowboys defensive end Demarcus Lawrence during the second half of an NFL football game, Sunday, Nov. 11, 2018, in Philadelphia. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke)\n\nThrough 10 weeks of the NFL season we now have a better idea of the strengths and weaknesses of NFL teams and their defensive identities.\n\nWhile NFL head coaches game plan how to exploit these weaknesses, savvy fantasy owners do the same thing to gain an edge in daily fantasy tournaments.\n\nThere are four teams allowing 23-plus fantasy points to opposing quarterbacks through 10 weeks of the season and the gap from the fourth to the fifth place team is nearly as large as the gap from the fifth place to the 20th place team. New Orleans, Tampa Bay, Cincinnati and Atlanta have all emerged as defensive units that allow consistent production to opposing quarterbacks. The Saints are a particularly unique case as they have been a top 5 rush defense and funnel opponents toward the pass. The Eagles travel to New Orleans this week to play in the SuperDome, often referred to as \u201cThe Coors Field of DFS\u201d due to the high-scoring matchups, just like what fantasy baseball players see from Colorado.\n\nCarson Wentz projects as a top QB option in a matchup where the Eagles have a 24-point team total and a need to throw if they\u2019re trailing. DailyRoto has Wentz projected for the highest passing yardage of any QB on the Week 11 main slates, expected to throw for 300-plus yards and two touchdowns with upside for more. The Saints defense has also allowed the most PPR points to opposing pass catchers and both Alshon Jeffrey and Zach Ertz can be paired comfortably with Wentz in tournaments. The duo has combined for 56 targets over the previous three weeks and should be in line for another strong workload. While it remains to be seen how quickly Golden Tate can pick up the Eagles offense, his emergence would hurt Nelson Agholor more than Jeffrey or Ertz.\n\nThe Raiders, Patriots, Bucs and Panthers all average double digit points allowed to opposing tight ends. With DFS pricing tighter, the highly variant tight end position has been a popular position to save salary. At just $2,900 on DraftKings, Arizona\u2019s Ricky Seals-Jones should provide value and salary relief for fantasy lineups. Since Byron Leftwich took over playcalling, Seals-Jones has drawn 13 targets in the last two games and finished with double digit fantasy points in Week 10. Betting on Seals-Jones is also a bet against the depth of the tight-end position as a whole, allowing daily players to spend up on high volume wideouts and running backs.\n\nAmong running backs, Ezekiel Elliott of Dallas also has value for tournaments against an Atlanta Falcons team that ranks as a bottom five defense against opposing RBs. Zeke is one of the true workhorse backs, seeing 90 percent of the Cowboys snaps at running back, virtually all of their RB carries and he also projecting for an 18 percent share of targets in Week 11. With high ownership going to Saquon Barkley, Melvin Gordon and Alvin Kamara, using Elliott could be a contrarian play that pays dividends.\n\n___\n\nFor more daily fantasy tools and advice, visit DailyRoto: https://dailyroto.com", "Jason Coffman, right, talks to the media about his son, Cody Coffman, who died in the shooting, and holds onto his father-in-law, Mike Johnston, in Thousand Oaks, Calif., Thursday, Nov. 8, 2018.

That leaves just one state in which a jury can convict a defendant of a felony on a 10-2 vote. Can you guess what that state is?\n\nThat\u2019s right. But there\u2019s an excellent chance that Oregon voters will get a chance in 2020 to erase this stain on the state\u2019s constitution \u2014 and legislators are kicking around a fix in the 2019 session that could cover the gap until that election.\n\nUntil last Tuesday night, Oregon and Louisiana were the only two states to allow a nonunanimous jury to decide a felony case, although Oregon does require unanimous juries in murder or aggravated murder cases. In last Tuesday\u2019s election, though, 65 percent of Louisiana voters approved a constitutional amendment to do away with nonunanimous convictions; the amendment goes into effect on Jan. 1. The measure drew support from political players of every stripe, from the state\u2019s Republican Party to the Southern Poverty Law Center.\n\nIn Louisiana, the nonunanimous jury rule dates back to 1898; scholars have argued that the measure was intended to limit the influence of African-American jurors.\n\nOregon\u2019s nonunanimous jury practice also was born out of prejudice \u2014 but in this case, it was anti-immigrant fervor that paved the way.\n\nThe state amended its constitution in 1934 to allow juries to decide most felony cases on 10-2 votes. Legal scholars (most notably, Aliza Kaplan of Lewis & Clark Law School, who wrote an influential piece on this topic) point to a sensational Columbia County murder case that paved the way for the ill-considered amendment.\n\nThat 1933 case involved a Jewish suspect, Jake Silverman, on trial for murder. One juror held out against conviction, and the jury eventually reached a compromise guilty verdict on a lesser charge of manslaughter. A judge sentenced Silverman to three years in prison.\n\nThe backlash was considerable. The Morning Oregonian, for example, railed against the verdict on its editorial pages, in language that was \u2014 well, not even borderline racist, but you can be the judge. Consider this excerpt from a November 1933 editorial: \u201cThis newspaper\u2019s opinion is that the increased urbanization of American life ... and the vast immigration into America from southern and eastern Europe, of people untrained in the jury system, have combined to make the jury of twelve increasingly unwieldy and unsatisfactory.\u201d The newspaper previously had editorialized against so-called \u201cmixed-blood\u201d jurors. (To be fair, The Oregonian recently recanted its 1933 editorial position on this matter.)\n\nThe Legislature, responding to the outcry, voted to place a constitutional amendment on the May 1934 ballot to allow nonunanimous juries. The measure drew no organized opposition and was approved by 58 percent of voters.\n\nSince then, a number of attempts have been made to amend the constitution on this point \u2014 including a recent effort by the Oregon District Attorneys Association \u2014 but none has managed to gain much traction. (The effort by the District Attorneys Association seemed to lose steam after a premature rollout of a website leaked critical details, but many Oregon prosecutors support eliminating nonunanimous verdicts.)\n\nSince the effort requires amending the constitution, it would require a vote. Last week, Democratic House Majority Leader Jennifer Williamson said she\u2019ll sponsor two bills on the matter in the 2019 Legislature: One would refer the question to voters in the 2020 general election. The other, she said, would be a statutory fix that would seek to ensure we don\u2019t have to wait until after the 2020 election to do away with nonunanimous juries.\n\nOregonians love to brag about the state\u2019s independence, how we love to stand apart. But here\u2019s a case where we need to fall into step with the rest of the nation, and the sooner we do that, the better.\n\n___\n\nThe Register-Guard, Nov. 10, on Gov. Brown needing to embody \u201cThe Oregon Way\u201d:\n\nGov. Kate Brown has a unique opportunity to succeed where our national government has failed.\n\nTo prevail in last week\u2019s election, Brown and her fellow Democrats put together a powerful coalition that not only re-elected her but also gained a supermajority in both the Oregon House and Senate.\n\nLegislative Democrats will have the power next year to make policy, including raising taxes, without needing any Republican votes. Yet that would not be good governance. Neither would it be long-lasting governance, given how the political pendulums swing.\n\nSo for Brown, this becomes the moment to defy conventional political wisdom and rise above the partisanship that permeates our country.\n\nBrown won with a grass-roots coalition that she said knocked on over 400,000 doors in 10 days. Imagine what could happen if Brown built a wider, deeper, bipartisan coalition to address the state\u2019s many challenges. That collaboration could transform Oregon.\n\nAs for Brown, she would be not just a two-term governor but an innovative, insightful and potentially great governor.\n\nTo achieve that, Brown must reinvent herself and lead with courage and candor instead of caution. The election campaign was overly divisive, but it raised legitimate criticisms of Brown\u2019s performance. Her focus has not been clear, her policies have been ill-defined and her administration\u2019s commitment to transparency has been iffy.\n\nIn the aftermath of Tuesday\u2019s election, Oregon\u2019s priorities should be clear to all. They are intertwined.\n\nOur high school graduation rate is too low, our school year too short, our student attendance too erratic. Legislators examining our educational system said last week that they were stunned at the impact of mental health issues and family upheaval on the classroom.\n\nHomelessness is pervasive, touching students, families and single individuals. The lack of affordable housing touches every corner of the state. Concerns about access to high-quality, affordable health care are widespread.\n\nSchools and local governments, burdened by Oregon\u2019s public pension system, increasingly struggle to provide basic services. The state budget is headed there too, unless Brown and lawmakers put together PERS reforms, other cost savings and revenue increases that can pass muster throughout the state, as the 2017 Legislature\u2019s transportation package did.\n\nChild protection and foster care remain significant challenges. Untreated substance abuse and mental illness disrupt families, cost jobs and clog the criminal justice system.\n\nThe economy is humming but not everywhere. And the urban-rural divide, which this election seemed to widen nationally, persists in Oregon.\n\nIt will be several weeks before the election tallies are official. As of last week, Brown won nearly 78 percent of the vote in Multnomah County and 55 percent in Lane County. However, she must be cognizant that statewide, her vote was hovering around only 50 percent. Although that was a substantial margin over Republican Knute Buehler\u2019s 46 percent, in some counties Brown did not draw even 20 percent of the vote.\n\nBrown has visited much of the state \u2014 dealing with wildfires and other issues \u2014 since succeeding Gov. John Kitzhaber in 2015. Yet the perception persists that she is Portland-focused.\n\nTo become a great governor, she must demolish that perception. That means getting out of the Portland-Salem area and getting to know the small towns throughout Oregon as well as the population centers like Eugene-Springfield. Sens. Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley hold town halls in all 36 counties every year. Why can\u2019t the governor?\n\nThose personal interactions are Brown\u2019s strength. When people meet her, they like her. Legislators of all political stripes say she is accessible. Yet she often has been described as listening but not really hearing. She has been deaf to valid criticisms of her administration, proclaiming her good work instead of understanding where she fell down. She has stood up to the Trump administration on national issues but been cautious within Oregon on state issues.\n\nHaving won her second and final consecutive term as governor, Brown should dare to lead. Her supporters count on her to carry their progressive ideas through the Oregon Capitol. Brown must make room for views representative of the entire state to join her in refining those goals. Again, such a diverse coalition \u2014 in politics, geography and other ways \u2014 could best meet Oregon\u2019s challenges and also serve as a national model.\n\nPublic officials frequently talk about \u201cThe Oregon Way,\u201d by which they mean true collaboration where each side believes it has an opportunity to shape the outcome, and the final result is more than the individual parts. That is the epitome of leadership.\n\nThat is the opportunity for Kate Brown.\n\nThat is the hope for Oregon.\n\n___\n\nThe Bend Bulletin, Nov. 8, on preparing for the Legislature\u2019s taxing superpowers:\n\nIf you don\u2019t like taxes, Nov. 7 was a rough morning in Oregon. Final results are still out, but Democrats now apparently hold a supermajority in the Legislature.\n\nAll those tax bills thwarted in the past by Republicans? Democratic supermajorities could even now have an eye on your wallet.\n\nOregon Democrats used to have to pretend that massive tax hikes, such as a proposed annual $700 million state carbon tax, weren\u2019t taxes at all. That enabled them to slouch past the state constitutional requirement for a supermajority.\n\nIn an outrageous bit of trickery, legislators insisted the new carbon taxes were not taxes because \u2014 they wrote that they were not in the bill. Now they won\u2019t even have to pretend.\n\nPlans for a $1 billion or more gross receipts tax will surely come back off the shelves. Democrats put plans for such a tax on hold after the failure of Measure 97, waiting for the outcome of the 2018 election. With a supermajority, expect it to be back.\n\nIn the Democratic Temple of Taxation, gross receipts taxes are among the holiest of holies. They tax business sales, usually don\u2019t allow deductions and businesses basically have to pay no matter what \u2014 even if they are not making a profit.\n\nBut they have serious flaws. Why tax a business that isn\u2019t managing to make a profit? Do Democrats really want to encourage more businesses to fail?\n\nGross receipts taxes also tax all transactions between businesses, including when businesses buy supplies and equipment to build their products. That means that gross receipts taxes pyramid. Businesses end up paying taxes on taxes on taxes.\n\nWe know Oregonians don\u2019t like sales taxes, but they are much fairer than charging taxes on taxes on taxes. And as the Oregon Legislative Revenue Office pointed out, tax pyramiding almost inevitably means higher prices for consumers.\n\nThe Legislature has also considered in the past bills that would cut mortgage interest deductions for homeowners. More than half a million Oregonians could lose that tax break for their state taxes. With the Legislature loaded with Democrats, start saying your goodbyes now to that deduction.\n\nThe only solace is that in Oregon voters still hold a check on the power of the Legislature to tax with or without a supermajority.\n\nTaxes can be challenged at the ballot box \u2014 except of course, Democrats may resort to their old trick of insisting taxes are really not taxes at all.", "Recent editorials from Louisiana newspapers:\n\n___\n\nNov. 11\n\nNOLA.com/The Times-Picayune on mental health treatment and the criminal justice system:\n\nAfter New Orleans police Officer Nicola Cotton was killed in 2008 by a man with a history of schizophrenia who attacked her and took her gun, lawmakers created a new type of court. Nicola\u2019s Law called for assisted outpatient treatment courts, in which a judge oversees mental health treatment in difficult cases to help keep patients on track.\n\nBut the Legislature provided no funding. And a decade later no assisted outpatient treatment program is operating in the state. Orleans Civil District Judge Kern Reese is starting a pilot program now to provide support services for patients when they are released from University Medical Center. But he needs more funding.\n\nSeparate from that effort, there are three parishes \u2014 St. Tammany, Orleans and Calcasieu \u2014 that have behavioral health courts to help defendants who have been diagnosed with mental illness succeed on probation.\n\nThis isn\u2019t nearly enough.\n\nAn estimated 634,000 adults in Louisiana have a mental illness or substance abuse disorder, but our state ranks 45th nationally in access to mental health care, according to Mental Health America.\n\nServices in Louisiana have been decimated over the past decade, as documented in NOLA.com/The Times-Picayune\u2019s \u201cA Fragile State\u201d project. Gov. Bobby Jindal\u2019s administration closed the New Orleans Adolescent Hospital in 2009 and shifted inpatient services to Southeast Louisiana State Hospital in Mandeville. Then, in 2012, his administration closed that hospital.\n\nThe state has cut other mental care services and lost federal money, which has left people who are dealing with mental illness with even fewer options.\n\nSadly, jails, emergency rooms and nursing homes have been left to house and care for many people who are mentally ill in Louisiana. Locking up someone who actually needs treatment is shameful.\n\nAssisted outpatient treatment programs, known as AOT, and behavioral health courts could help prevent that.\n\nSt. Tammany Judge Peter Garcia started his Behavioral Health Court in 2011 with a grant. It is an 18-month program that is set up to give defendants diagnosed with a mental illness the support they need to comply with the terms of their probation. The court can handle up to about 40 people at a time.\n\nJudge Garcia spends his lunch hour on Wednesdays dealing with these cases. A team of social workers, probation officers, attorneys, mental health advocates and court staffers join him for the session to look at the needs of people in the program. There are consequences for probation violations, but jail isn\u2019t the first option.\n\nIt\u2019s working. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen the lives it\u2019s changed, the family members it\u2019s affected,\u201d Nick Richard, executive director of NAMI\u2019s St. Tammany chapter, said in an interview with NOLA.com/The Times-Picayune. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing these people who have had a long history of not being able to complete probation have a successful recovery.\u201d\n\nMr. Richard, who works with the behavioral health team in Judge Garcia\u2019s court, said it is only fair to offer people with mental illness alternatives. \u201cHow just is it to sanction someone to jail because the mental health system failed them?\u201d he said.\n\nIt isn\u2019t.\n\nEvery parish dealing with defendants who are mentally ill ought to have these alternative court programs.\n\n...\n\nOnline: https://www.nola.com/\n\n___\n\nNov. 14\n\nThe Advocate on a grading system for public schools:\n\nEverybody wants a shiny A on the report card, but the goal of then-Gov. Bobby Jindal when he pushed letter grades for public schools was to make clear to the public whether a school was doing well or not.\n\nWell, not every school can be an A campus, nor can every system get an A. In the fictional Lake Wobegon, all the children were above-average, but in real life, the letter grades cannot provide that affirmation to principals and superintendents.\n\nYet what is the important goal of the letter grades? Clarity is good, but parents and teachers should keep them in perspective: They are just one part of a much more elaborate system of school performance scores. The scores are based on whether a school is providing a solid academic foundation for the student, and the bar should be raised over time.\n\nNow that long-promised commitment to improvement has happened, with a series of gradual changes to make the standards for school performance scores tougher. Given that reality, it\u2019s not surprising that some schools have not done as well as in the past.\n\nThe first report cards since standards were strengthened means fewer top-rated schools and more with lower grades. Only 13 percent of schools earned A ratings compared to 20 percent under the old scoring system; F-rated schools rose from 8 percent to 12 percent.\n\nWhat is important is that the academic standards rise.\n\nIn releasing the new scores, state Superintendent of Education John White said that there hasn\u2019t been that dramatic a difference; the overall distribution of grades is roughly the same as 2017.\n\nStill, parents have a right to worry if their child is going to a D or F-rated school, even if the school\u2019s score reflects a higher expectation for academics.\n\nSchools should get credit for improvements in student performance. Nevertheless, D- and F-rated schools clearly have much more work to do. Officials in charge of nearly 40 percent of Louisiana schools will be asked, in compliance with the state\u2019s pledge under federal law, to develop plans for how to help lower-scoring schools improve.\n\nThe goal of a rating system is not to generate numbers, but to use the numbers to drive reform. A classroom with an effective teacher is always going to do better, and principals\u2019 interventions and mentoring by other teachers are one part of the formula.\n\nUnder federal law, some of the changes might involve improvements focused on specific groups of students, such as those learning English as a second language.\n\nBut as Jindal intended, ultimately the complexity of the challenge should result in school improvements that parents and taxpayers can see reflected in the letter grades for schools.\n\nOnline: https://www.theadvocate.com/\n\n___\n\nNov. 13\n\nThe Advocate on Medicaid expansion:\n\nWhen Louisiana in 2016 joined the majority of states expanding Medicaid insurance coverage for the working poor, it turned out to be a good move for the state\u2019s people and for its general fund, as almost all of the costs are picked up under the much-debated Obamacare law of 2010.\n\nOther \u201cred\u201d states politically are starting to take notice, and they don\u2019t get much redder than Idaho.\n\nIn advance of last Tuesday\u2019s election, Republican Gov. Butch Otter endorsed a ballot initiative that would expand Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare. It won.\n\nThe measure\u2019s supporters said it would provide coverage for those making too much to qualify for Medicaid, but not enough to qualify for subsidized health insurance through the state insurance exchange set up under provision of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIdaho was not alone.\n\nVoters in Nebraska and Utah also opted to expand Medicaid, a central tenet of Obamacare. In Montana, voters rejected a ballot measure that would have extended the state\u2019s expansion and funded it with an increase in cigarette taxes, so it was not a clean sweep for the ACA.\n\nOther states\u2019 decisions, like that of Louisiana, may depend on governor\u2019s races where Democrats made gains. Until last Tuesday, 17 of the 50 states did not expand Medicaid.\n\nLouisiana was a laggard, purely because of politics: Republican legislators and then-Gov. Bobby Jindal were adamant opponents of anything with the name of then-President Barack Obama on it.\n\nThe election of Gov. John Bel Edwards broke a logjam and made the expanded coverage available to thousands of families that need it in the Bayou State.\n\nThe number of adults in Louisiana without health insurance has dropped dramatically since the state expanded Medicaid two years ago, a new report has found.\n\nThe Louisiana Health Insurance Survey is performed every two years by researchers at LSU. It found 11.4 percent of non-elderly adults in the state did not have health insurance in 2017 \u2014 down from 22.7 percent uninsured in 2015.\n\nUnder Medicaid expansion, which took effect July 2016 under Edwards\u2019 executive order, more than 487,000 non-elderly adults have received health care coverage, the survey reported.\n\nSince 2010, nearly 90 rural hospitals across the nation have shut their doors, reported The New York Times recently. In Louisiana, rural hospitals are healthier, as working families in poorer parishes now have reliable insurance coverage under Medicaid expansion.\n\nIt\u2019s a good deal for the state\u2019s general fund because most of the costs are covered by the U.S. Treasury and a hospital fee. Those are still costs, of course, but we believe the benefits vastly outweigh the burden.\n\nA healthier population is the goal that should be kept in mind. We don\u2019t know how many states will now follow suit, but it\u2019s a good bet that the benefits found in our state will be persuasive elsewhere.\n\nOnline: https://www.theadvocate.com/", "MILWAUKEE (AP) \u2014 Prosecutors say a Milwaukee sheriff\u2019s deputy who fatally shot a man in an SUV last year was justified in killing him because the man\u2019s reckless driving posed a threat.\n\nDeputy Michael Truax shot 19-year-old Terry Williams after Williams failed to obey a traffic sign and drove off a road and onto grassy public space on Milwaukee\u2019s lakefront on June 2017.

It\u2019s a sort of a 12-block town of less than 600 people tucked between Wheat Ridge and Lakeside. It\u2019s claim to fame is how the town makes money. A joint 9News-Rocky Mountain PBS investigation in 2014 and beyond revealed that the townlette is a notorious ticket farm. Stories made public that the municipality makes up to half its revenue by having its 10-person police force hand out a mountain of tickets for things like having an air-freshener hanging from a rear-view mirror or driving a car with a cracked windshield.\n\nThe Arapahoe County sheriff oversees a staff of deputies and jail employees nearly as large as the town Brown is now policing. He previously was a police officer for a short time in Northglenn, and before that, a code enforcement officer in Aurora.\n\nHe\u2019s a smart and affable man. And he may eventually make a good sheriff. But if Brown were applying for a similar top police job in any county or city in the country, he wouldn\u2019t even get an interview because of his lack of ranking experience.\n\nThe current sheriff, Dave Walcher, virtually has a lifetime of experience. He also boasts rave reviews from local officials and peers across the political spectrum as a solid lawman.\n\nHe lost last week\u2019s election because a \u201cblue wave\u201d of votes for Democrats washed over just about every Republican in the county.\n\nWalcher is a Republican.\n\nThe county has long been a Republican stronghold, so despite the recent anti-Trump, anti-Walker Stapleton sentiment, the down-ballot outrage for all things Republican was surprising.\n\nThe same thing happened to Arapahoe County assessor and clerk incumbents. Both were tossed out last week by voters only because they were Republicans.\n\nVoters have just elected a Democratic Realtor to run one of biggest and most complex property tax assessment offices in the state, throwing out an esteemed pro who\u2019s worked as a professional for years.\n\nThe county assessor, clerk, treasurer, coroner and sheriff have no more to do with partisan politics than does the employee who plows the roads.\n\nAt the very least, these should be non-partisan offices, but for the sake of the public, they should be appointed by the county commission in the same way cities like Aurora appoint its police chief and top administrative officials.\n\nState lawmakers this year should create legislation to permit and encourage counties to end the ludicrous partisan pandemonium for all elected positions, but especially administrative ones.\n\nBetter yet, counties should be required to end the pioneer-days notion of electing these positions. They\u2019re important enough to require specific skills, experience and much more accountability and scrutiny than they now get just once every four years. And these positions are far too important to be decided by the political whims of voters taking out their righteous disdain for politics in Washington and Denver against down-ballot elected officials with the wrong letter at the end of their name on the ballot.\n\nEditorial: https://bit.ly/2OKkpq3\n\n___\n\n(Colorado Springs) The Gazette, Nov. 11, on never soaking the rich:\n\nPandering politicians claim the rich are a problem for the poor. They talk of \u201cincome disparity\u201d and a \u201cconcentration of wealth\u201d among the few. They appeal to class envy and declare something must be done.\n\nThe Gazette\u2019s editorial board heard it recently in a meeting with our friend, Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper. The wealthy Democrat is a likely candidate for president and speaks of the need for future tax policies to address a \u201cconcentration of wealth\u201d resulting from the technological revolution.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at all senior executives and shareholders of these companies, basically you have to switch your eyes,\u201d Hickenlooper said. \u201cThat\u2019s sucking money out of every man, woman and child in this country.\n\n\u201cWe as a society have to figure out what we\u2019re going to do about it. It\u2019s going to doom us to not be able to take care of our elderly when they\u2019re sick. It\u2019s going to doom us. We\u2019ll face moral situations we\u2019re not going to want. I sound like a (expletive) socialist, but I\u2019m not.\u201d\n\nHe is a quintessential capitalist, if we consider his actions instead of words. His life story belies his concern.\n\nHickenlooper\u2019s tale reveals the secret of success. It is a recipe of patience, vision, delayed gratification and using money like seed corn.\n\nHe worked as an oil and gas geologist in the 1980s. When oil prices fell, he lost his job.\n\nWith extremely limited resources, Hickenlooper built a dream job. He converted a vacant warehouse in lower downtown Denver into a brewpub, before most people knew about craft beer.\n\nThe famous Wynkoop Brewing Company led a cultural and economic renaissance in a dilapidated warehouse district.\n\nHickenlooper had no reason to stop. He opened more brewpubs, including the popular Phantom Canyon in downtown Colorado Springs. Phantom Canyon inspired others to invest in the neighborhood. Over decades, the growth of Hickenlooper\u2019s small investment helped make Colorado\u2019s Front Range the Napa Valley of high-end beer.\n\nIn creating a small restaurant empire, Hickenlooper\u2019s net worth grew to millions. As he concentrated wealth, investing in constructive endeavors, he deprived the working class and poor of nothing. He created work for truck drivers, waiters, cooks, janitors, CPAs, lawyers, architects and more. By growing his wealth, he spread wealth.\n\nHickenlooper\u2019s success enhanced the tax base, generating revenue for indigent health care and other social concerns he cares about.\n\nIn a free market, wealth amasses among those who provide the goods, services and commodities humanity needs. One gets rich by producing riches, which are all that backs the value of a dollar.\n\nTo simplify, consider a tale of two young twins. Bobby and Cindy receive $5 gift cards from grandma. One will grow the money, the other will not.\n\nEach child wants the latest Fortnite game app upgrade, a bag of Skittles, and a Sprite. Problem is, the game costs $4. The remaining dollar won\u2019t buy Skittles and Sprite.\n\nBobby settles for the game. Cindy commits to having all three and buys none with her $5. Instead, she spends $4 on powdered lemonade and sets up a table at the park. She sells 32 drinks for 50 cents each. She earns $16. Minus her $4 investment, plus the dollar she had, Cindy has $13 instead of $5.\n\nWith $13, Cindy buys the game, the Skittles and the Sprite for $7. She has $6 remaining and invests an additional $4 in Lemonade. Each time she repeats the cycle, she has more cash and more of what it can buy. She uses her expanding pool of capital to start additional lemonade stands run by kids who repay her with a cut.\n\nCindy took nothing from Bobby or anyone else. By growing her capital \u2014 and her net worth \u2014 she helped people in need of refreshment. The local store sold more Skittles, Sprite and lemonade. She traded her wealth with many, each benefiting from the exchanges. It all began with 5 bucks.\n\nBobby considers Cindy\u2019s wealth unfair, even though he benefits from her plentiful candy supply and regular Fortnite upgrades.\n\n\u201cTell Cindy to share her money. She has more than she needs,\u201d Bobby says to mom.\n\nThink: new tax on Cindy.\n\n\u201cIf I do that, Cindy will have less to invest in lemonade. That does no one any favors,\u201d mom explains. \u201cGo help Cindy sell lemonade.\u201d\n\nThis phenomenon scales up and the outcomes do not change, whether one turns dollars into millions or billions. It works the same when Apple sells iPhones or Exxon sells fuel. It works the same when a jobless man creates an entertainment trend in a warehouse.\n\nConstructive endeavors grow the gross domestic product. Everyone wins when millionaires, billionaires or penny ante lemonade barons grow the economy.\n\nBecause of capitalism spreading around the globe, by humans accumulating wealth, the world poverty rate fell from 28.6 percent in 1970 to about 5 percent in the early 21st century.\n\nDon\u2019t believe the myth of the zero-sum game. Someone getting rich does not cause someone to get poor.\n\nCapitalists do not bury money in the backyard, keeping it from the middle class and poor. They succeed financially by solving problems and improving the way we live, work and play. To do so, they create jobs, distribute goods and consume. They are economic brewer\u2019s yeast, growing the money supply and keeping it moving. By amassing wealth, they benefit the rich, poor and middle class alike. As you did, Mr. Governor. It is a far cry from doom.\n\nEditorial: https://bit.ly/2qNNIyC\n\n___\n\nGrand Junction Daily Sentinel, Nov. 11, on transitioning to Gov. Polis:\n\nFresh off his Election Day win, Governor-elect Jared Polis on Thursday pledged to protect the state\u2019s public lands and promote its outdoor recreation industry, which he said provides 229,000 jobs and $2 billion a year in state and local taxes in Colorado.\n\nFor Polis, the Outdoor Retailer Winter Market in Denver couldn\u2019t have been timed more perfectly. The show provided a ready audience to tout his commitment to Colorado\u2019s outdoors heritage. The Outdoor Retailer trade show left Utah because state leaders there were perceived as hostile toward public lands issues, including protecting Bear Ears National Monument.\n\n\u201cI will very much take seriously my responsibility to be a faithful steward of our outdoor resources as well as an evangelist for growth of the outdoor tourism and recreation economy,\u201d Polis said at the massive trade show.\n\nA day later, Polis put some teeth behind those sentiments by naming Sarah Shrader and Ken Gart to his transition team. Both have been evangelists in their own right about plumping up the role outdoor recreation can play as a driver in the Grand Valley\u2019s economy. Shrader, the founder and owner of Bonsai Design, which is anchoring a private-public partnership to establish an outdoor recreation-themed business park at Las Colonias, and Gart, one of the owners of Powderhorn Mountain Resort and Gov. John Hickenlooper\u2019s bike czar, were appointed to a transition team subcommittee focused on economic development and labor.\n\nAll told, there are seven committees, \u201ceach tasked with helping us find the best talent in Colorado to join our administration and helping us dig into a specific stet of questions or challenges,\u201d according to Polis\u2019s transition website, www.BoldlyForward.co. The Keystone Center is facilitating the work of the transition team subcommittees.\n\nThe transition team includes major political donors and prominent Democrats, such as former Gov. Bill Ritter, Lt. Gov. Donna Lynne and former Colorado State University President Al Yates. But Polis spokeswoman Mara Sheldon said no lobbyists or current lawmakers are part of the team and the transition website invites anyone to apply for a position among the subcommittees and the working groups they oversee.\n\nIn a statement Polis said he and Lt. Gov.-elect Dianne Primavera \u201cplan to hit the ground running in January and get to work turning our vision for a stronger education system, expanding access to affordable health care, and an economy that works for everyone into reality,\u201d Jared Polis said. \u201cOver the next 60 days, a group of more than 60 experts in their field, community leaders, and Coloradans representing the broad diversity of our state will be helping us prepare to take on these challenges.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re glad to see Polis reaching out to the Western Slope, especially in the realm of outdoor recreation. Hopefully some of the region\u2019s other luminaries with expertise in health care, education and transportation \u2014 and the challenges they pose in rural areas \u2014 will find their way onto the roster regardless of political affiliation. Because the best ideas always transcend partisanship.\n\nEditorial: https://bit.ly/2qMVJUn\n\n___\n\nThe Durango Herald, Nov. 9, on Colorado voters\u2019 approach to amendments and propositions:\n\nDecision-making by ballot was in high order in this fall\u2019s election in Colorado. Tax increases and additions to the constitution and new statutes which never would have been created by the legislature were subject to much rhetoric and to limited discussion. For the most part the craziness was voted down.\n\nAmendment 73, which would have added to the taxes of businesses and high-income individuals to provide $1.6 billion for public schools was defeated by 12 percentage points (following the 2016 election, amendments to the state Constitution require 55 percent approval). Residential taxes would contribute and the Gallagher\u2019s factor\u2019s downward spiral would be halted; on the other hand, noncommercial property owners would see a school tax reduction. And, a new funding formula was have been required.\n\nAmendment 73 included appealing components, but it was too expansive to be absorbed by voters in a couple of months. It did not lend itself to yard signs.\n\nMore importantly, and unfortunately, 73 is not a mix that the Colorado Legislature would be able to design. Anything like it would require extraordinary participation from all players.\n\nColoradans made clear they also do not want to pay for highways with new taxes nor threaten the state\u2019s budget. An additional sales tax which would have put a big dent in the state\u2019s backlog of construction needs lost by 12 points (a statute, so only 51 percent was needed). A second, limited approach to use existing revenues to fund a smaller list of projects also failed by about the same amount. Voters likely heard the opposition cautioning voters that in difficult economic times, that money would have to come from other state needs.\n\nWhat will be the next approach? The newcomers whom the state\u2019s strong economy are attracting are growing the state\u2019s highway needs. Current funding mostly covers repairs only.\n\nThe extreme oil and gas well setback distance, which originated in and around Boulder County, where wells back up against subdivisions, rightly failed by 8 percentage points statewide. Proposition 112 was too excessive for most of the state, and would have almost halted the exploration industry which comes with good jobs and healthy local and state tax revenues. Voters showed good judgment.\n\nIt was the possibility of a large setback requirement that caused the energy industry, aided by agricultural groups, to put forth the \u201ctakings\u201d amendment to the Constitution, which would have had governments compensate landowners for reducing the value of their property - preventing drilling, that is. But that compensation could have been extended to the negative effects of all kinds of government decisions involving property, leading to government inaction and legal frenzies. Wisely, Amendment 74 was defeated.\n\nBallot questions can be overly simplistic or excessive, poorly constructed or miss their mark. And they can test voters\u2019 wishes. A Colorado election can include examples of them all.\n\nEditorial: https://bit.ly/2zRSMpU", "FILE - In this Dec. 15, 2014, file photo, Massachusetts Gov.

(AP) \u2014 Joey Logano is the outlier in this year\u2019s championship race. He was never in the mix for this year\u2019s Cup title, not until he used his bumper to move reigning champion Martin Truex Jr. out of his way to forcefully snag a spot in NASCAR\u2019s version of the final four.\n\nThe move aggravated Truex, who vowed not to allow Logano to win the title . \u201cHe may have won the battle,\u201d Truex fumed, \u201cbut he ain\u2019t winning the damn war.\u201d\n\nA week later, Aric Almirola made a similar promise because he was rankled Logano refused to cut him any slack on the track.\n\nTime and again, Logano finds himself in the center of a high-profile spat.\n\nA decade of dealing with these silly little slights, being pushed around on and off the track, has taught Logano how to tune it out. He goes into Sunday\u2019s winner-take-all season finale at Homestead-Miami Speedway convinced he\u2019s finally going to win his first Cup title.\n\nLogano will race Truex, Kevin Harvick and Kyle Busch for the championship.\n\n\u201cI said 15 weeks ago we were an underdog and I would be surprised if we made it to the final four,\u201d Logano said. \u201cNow I feel like we are the favorites to win this thing. It\u2019s crazy how things change.\u201d\n\nHe feels as if he\u2019s the favorite, but Logano is clearly the underdog of this group. His No. 22 Team Penske group was mediocre most of the season and an afterthought to the so-called Big Three of Busch, Harvick and Truex, a trio of former series champions who dominated the regular season.\n\nBut Logano mastered a path through the playoffs and could pull off the upset of his career.\n\nIt would be vindication for the driver tagged as NASCAR\u2019s next superstar by Hall of Famer Mark Martin when Logano was just a teen waiting to turn 18 and be eligible to race at NASCAR\u2019s national level. He was nicknamed \u201cSliced Bread,\u201d because he was allegedly \u201cthe best thing since,\u201d and the expectations were enormous by the time he made his debut.\n\nLogano is by nature happy-go-lucky, and when he made it to the big leagues, his parents traveled the circuit with him. That became a bone of contention among Logano\u2019s peers, who resented his clean path into NASCAR and found him an easy target for scuffles on and off the track.\n\nThen he was pushed into the Cup Series way ahead of schedule because Joe Gibbs Racing, the team that groomed him, had an unexpected opening. It made Logano a target for everyone from Tony Stewart, Kevin Harvick, Denny Hamlin, Matt Kenseth and other high-profile drivers.\n\nDrama after drama would have broken some, but Logano has rebounded every time.\n\nWhen Gibbs could no longer wait for him to produce, he landed with Team Penske and has won 18 races since moving teams. He\u2019s qualified for NASCAR\u2019s championship round in three of the last five seasons, and was the favorite to win the title in 2015 but a feud with Matt Kenseth led to Kenseth wrecking Logano out of an automatic berth into the finale.\n\nHe was in a spectacular crash racing Carl Edwards for the victory the next year, and a penalty kept the No. 22 team out of the playoffs last season. Logano was the first driver locked into the finale this year, despite just one regular-season victory and not showing his Ford could keep up with the Big Three.\n\nHe earned his berth win a victory at Martinsville Speedway, where he moved Truex out of his way in the final turn to grab the ticket to Homestead. Truex was furious with the move, but Logano was adamant he had to take that opportunity and couldn\u2019t risk not going for broke.\n\nLogano was booed as he took the checkered flag.\n\n\u201cI love his passion. The one thing you\u2019ve got to appreciate out of Joey is that he races, he gives 100 percent,\u201d said Logano crew chief Todd Gordon. \u201cHe\u2019s racing all the time, and that\u2019s a great attribute of his. He\u2019s up on it. You never have to question where we are, if it\u2019s through practice or through any session, you\u2019re getting 100 percent out of him.\u201d\n\nLogano backed up his right to be aggressive with Truex and Almirola in last weekend\u2019s penultimate playoff race at Phoenix. A flat tire caused him to crash out early. If Logano hadn\u2019t won Martinsville, the Phoenix crash would have prevented him from making the finale. So he paid no mind to Truex\u2019s anger, and even less to Almirola\u2019s assentation that Logano should have cut other playoff drivers some slack because Logano had nothing on the line once he was locked into Homestead.\n\n\u201cOur sport was built on tough racing and I\u2019m going to race hard,\u201d Logano said. \u201cI\u2019m a racer. That\u2019s what I am. I\u2019ve got one gear when I get in a race car ... it\u2019s to go win the race. To be a good race car driver, a lot of times you have to be selfish, you\u2019ve got to think about what\u2019s best for your race team and I think that\u2019s kind of the approach I\u2019ve taken over the years.\n\n\u201cOnce I started racing that way, I\u2019ve won a lot more races.\u201d\n\nHe also had to deal with the ire of some of his rivals, namely Kenseth in 2015. He and Kenseth had tangled on the track various times in that season, when Logano won six races, including three straight in the playoffs. One of those wins was at Kansas and Logano didn\u2019t need it to advance into the next round and the victory came at Kenseth\u2019s expense.\n\nLogano was unapologetic, made no effort to make peace with Kenseth, and Kenseth retaliated two weeks later by preventing Logano from winning at Martinsville Speedway to earn an automatic berth into the championship. Logano didn\u2019t recover and missed the final four.\n\nAll of those altercations \u201cmake you tough as nails,\u201d Logano said, but also matured him into the driver he is now. The problems with Kenseth were a career-changer in that Logano now understands politics in racing stretch off the track and into the motorhome lot.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve learned how to handle situations,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to go through things to learn things sometimes and you just have to learn things the hard way. It\u2019s not the fun way to learn things the hard way, but you do and not only does that help you on the race track, but for the rest of my life I\u2019ll be able to take those lessons with me.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP Auto Racing: https://apnews.com/apf-AutoRacing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "CLAYTON, Mo. (AP) \u2014 A police association that focuses on adding diversity and fighting discrimination is trying to gain a foothold within the St. Louis County Police Department, but its leaders claim the police chief is blocking its path.\n\nThe Fraternal Order of Police is the collective bargaining unit for 860 rank-and-file officers in the county that surrounds St. Louis city. In April, several black officers citing concerns about lack of diversity and racial tension asked the mostly-black city-based Ethical Society of Police to expand into the county as an alternative association. Since then, 54 black county officers have joined, along with 10 white officers.\n\nPolice Chief Jon Belmar refuses to sign a memorandum formally recognizing their association on the grounds that the Fraternal Order of Police has exclusive collective bargaining rights.\n\nEthical Society leaders say they don\u2019t want to be a bargaining unit \u2014 their goal is to promote diversity and represent members in disciplinary and personnel hearings.

But at a county council meeting on Tuesday, Fraternal Order of Police representative Jane Dueker said the Ethical Society\u2019s proposed memorandum of understanding included ambiguous language that could be interpreted as seeking collective bargaining rights.\n\nIn a letter earlier this month, Belmar cited \u201cgreat strides\u201d in recruitment and said more minority officers have been promoted to higher ranks, from sergeants up through command staff.\n\nStill, Ethical Society leaders say Belmar\u2019s refusal to sign the memorandum is another setback for a region whose racial scars were torn open after the fatal police shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson in 2014.\n\nBrown, who was black and unarmed, was killed in a street confrontation with white Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson. A St. Louis County grand jury and the U.S. Department of Justice both declined to prosecute Wilson, who later resigned.\n\nBut the shooting led to months of protests and scrutiny over treatment of blacks by St. Louis-area police agencies and courts.\n\nMore than a dozen supporters of the Ethical Society spoke at the county council meeting.

The Ethical Society represents 240 black city officers, said the Rev. Darryl Gray, its community liaison.\n\nThe St. Louis Police Officers Association represents around 1,100 city officers, its business manager, Jeff Roorda,said. Some officers are members of both organizations.\n\nIn the county, 808 of the 934 officers are white. Ninety-nine are black \u2014 less than 11 percent. African-Americans make up about 30 percent of county residents.\n\nRacial tension within the county department escalated in September when a black female officer resigned, citing concerns about what she saw as a culture of bias against blacks and women.\n\n\u201cActually it\u2019s a damn shame that we have to constantly in 2018 be dealing with racial issues,\u201d community activist Zaki Baruti told the council.", "OLYMPIA, Wash.

Pizano admits he can\u2019t be certain the suspicious payments were bribes, suggesting they may have even been outlays to paramilitary groups, and the conversation ends with Martinez telling Pizano not to discuss the matter with others.\n\nThe news program said Pizano, who had cancer, gave it the recording on the condition it not be aired until his death, which came last week. Authorities initially said he died of a heart attack, but that is now under review after his son died less than 72 hours later from exposure to cyanide contained in a bottle of flavored water found on his father\u2019s desk.\n\nThe Pizano recording dates from June 2015, just as the scandal over bribery payments was starting to engulf Odebrecht \u2014 revelations that that would lead to criminal charges against scores of senior politicians and business executives across Latin America. In a 2016 plea agreement with the U.S. Justice Department, Odebrecht admitted to paying $788 million in bribes to win contracts in 12 nations \u2014 including $11.1 million in Colombia.\n\nMartinez later became attorney general in 2016 despite complaints about his corporate background and years of service to the Aval Group, a New York Stock Exchange-listed banking conglomerate run by Colombia\u2019s richest man that was allied with Odebrecht.\n\nHe formally recused himself when his office opened an investigation into the Aval Group-Odebrecht contracts in 2017, charged a deputy minister and former senator with taking bribes and issued arrest orders against several middlemen as well as the former head of the Aval unit involved in the consortium.\n\nMartinez has since accused Odebrecht of shelling out almost $50 million in bribes in Colombia \u2014 or more than three times the amount the company acknowledged to U.S. authorities. Pizano was himself under investigation for an unrelated Odebrecht project.\n\nNow the recording has revived calls for Martinez to quit.\n\nThe union representing thousands of judicial workers called on Tuesday for Martinez\u2019s resignation, saying his apparent failure to denounce corruption he learned about in his law practice undermines his credibility as the standard bearer of Colombians\u2019 fights for justice.\n\n\u201cWhoever doesn\u2019t comprehend that sacred mission, or performs it with disregard, should step aside,\u201d the group said in a statement.\n\nMartinez through a spokesman declined a request for comment.\n\nThe 64-year-old, who also served in three previous Cabinet posts, was appointed to an autonomous, four-year term as Colombia\u2019s top law enforcement official in 2016 and he\u2019s been praised by U.S. officials who rely heavily on his agency\u2019s cooperation in hundreds of drug investigations every year aimed at breaking the Colombian cartels who are the world\u2019s top suppliers of cocaine.\n\nMartinez\u2019s cooperation has extended to ordering the controversial arrest on a U.S. drug warrant of a former guerrilla ideologue who negotiated the recent peace accord between the government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia.\n\nU.S. Ambassador Kevin Whitaker in September called Colombia\u2019s handling of the Odebrecht case \u201cthe best in the world, by far\u201d and attributed its success to the dedication of Martinez\u2019s office.\n\nBut his reputation took a hit when his top anticorruption prosecutor was arrested last year on a U.S. warrant for extorting bribes from politicians in exchange for soft-pedaling investigations against them.\n\nAnd he has been fending off allegations that he is abusing his authority to protect his long-time employer by Luis Andrade, the former head of Colombia\u2019s infrastructure agency.\n\nFor the past year, Andrade has been under house arrest on what he calls bogus charges that he favored Odebrecht\u2019s co-conspirators, though he has not been accused of taking bribes himself.\n\nHe has called the charges payback by Martinez for his attempt at the outbreak of the scandal to invalidate the Aval-Odebrecht highway contract.\n\nAn American citizen who previously helped run McKinsey & Company\u2019s consulting business in Latin America, he has enrolled a team of PR specialists and convinced a former U.S. senator to try to get the case dismissed.\n\nBut that effort has been complicated by the death of Pizano, who was supposed to be his key witness and is believed to have prepared detailed reports on corruption.\n\n\u201cJorge Pizano was a courageous man who dared to render testimony against Odebrecht and Aval,\u201d Andrade said. \u201cUnfortunately, it cost him his life.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Goodman on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APjoshgoodman", "Robert Bailey poses for photographers during a news conference at the Resorts World Casino New York City, Wednesday, Nov. 14, 2018, in New York.

(AP) \u2014 The Little Rock School District and the district\u2019s teachers\u2019 union agreed Tuesday to a contract through October 2019 after weeks of disagreement and tense negotiations.\n\nThe agreement came one day before the current contract was set to expire and was ratified unanimously by union members.\n\nThe contract contains language which says the education department can petition the state for a waiver that would make it easier to fire teachers in poorly performing schools.\n\nLast month, Arkansas Education Commissioner Johnny Key rejected a tentative agreement because the contract did not include language for the waiver. As the contract expiration date approached, both sides agreed to a two-week negotiation extension, which was set to expire Wednesday night. Little Rock School District has been under state control since 2015 because of low test scores in some schools.\n\nThe union agreed to the contract largely because the state could apply for the waiver regardless of whether the contract allowed it, said Little Rock Education Association President Teresa Knapp Gordon.\n\nIn a statement, Key called the agreement a \u201cwin for students.\u201d He underscored his support for a waiver, which would apply to teachers in Little Rock schools that the state has rated \u201cD\u2033 or \u201cF.\u201d\n\nThe contract also includes a clause which stipulates the Arkansas State Teacher Excellence Support System should be used to support teachers, and which provides \u201cclear expectations on performance\u201d which are consistent for all teachers.\n\nBoth Key and Gordon said they supported including the support system clause in the contract.\n\nGordon said an important objective for union members was the inclusion of a due-process clause, which says no disciplinary action can be taken against an employee without \u201cjust cause.\u201d Minor offenses can result in a variety of disciplinary actions before termination, though employees can be immediately fired for \u201cserious professional competency deficiencies or misconduct.\u201d\n\nThe agreement also gives the Little Rock Education Association sole representation rights in the district.\n\nBecause contract negotiations were so contentious this year, the new agreement says the current contract will apply while negotiations next year continue.\n\nGordon said negotiations nearly broke down on Monday. Both sides agreed to take a break and resume the next day, and by Tuesday evening a deal was reached.", "FILE - In this Sept. 15, 2018, file photo, Clemson's Clelin Ferrell (99) rushes into the backfield during the first half of an NCAA college football game against Georgia Southern, in Clemson, S.C.

That\u2019s just a half-sack more than Ferrell, who\u2019s confident his total will rise over the final two weeks of the season.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s two things a defensive lineman always knows: How much he bench presses and how many sacks he has,\u201d said Ferrell, adding that he has pressed 405 pounds. \u201cI\u2019m at 8\u00bd (sacks) right now. The year\u2019s going well, but I feel like there\u2019s another level I can take it to for my teammates.\u201d\n\nSacks aren\u2019t the only category where ACC players are making their presence felt.\n\nBoston College\u2019s Hamp Cheevers is tied for first with six interceptions and leads a three-man ACC contingent in the top five. Virginia\u2019s Juan Thornhill and Syracuse\u2019s Andre Cisco are tied for third with five picks each.\n\nThe conference also has a significant presence in tackles for loss with five in the top 25 nationally. Two are at Miami: Senior Gerald Willis III (17) is tied for eighth and sophomore Jonathan Garvin (14.5) is tied for 18th. Syracuse junior Alton Robinson is tied for 15th with 15 while Burns, Ferrell and Boston College\u2019s Zach Allen are tied for 23rd with 13.5.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t stop there.\n\nVirginia cornerback Bryce Hall leads the nation with 19 passes defended and has intercepted two.

State\u2019s Germaine Pratt (91) rank 32nd and 38th respectively in that category.\n\nHaving defensive difference-makers has helped Syracuse (8-2) to the No. 12 ranking in the Top 25 \u2014 its highest since September 1998 \u2014 while BC (7-3) is 22nd.\n\nHall jokes that Thornhill steals his interceptions, but adds that it\u2019s because his fellow Cavalier is all over the field.\n\n\u201cUltimately, he\u2019s a playmaker,\u201d Hall said of Thornhill. \u201cI like his game because anywhere you stick him on the defense, he\u2019s going to make plays and that just shows how smart he is.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no underestimating the value coaches place on a player with a keen instinct for the ball, such as the Seminoles\u2019 Burns.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s smart, first of all,\u201d Florida State defensive coordinator Harlon Barnett Barnett said. \u201cA smart football player allows you to be an even better football player on all levels. If you have a great understanding of your opponent \u2014 the guy across from you and the scheme \u2014 and understanding certain situations (where) they like to do this and certain situations they like to do that. ... Now, your game can go to another level.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a great example of that.\u201d\n\nThat type of play can also make teammates better. BC is a great example of that.\n\nThe Eagles\u2019 Ray has definitely thrived playing on the opposite end of Allen, who was the nation\u2019s only lineman with 100 tackles last season. Boston College coach Steve Addazio cites Allen as his biggest playmaker and praises Cheevers and Ray for making clutch plays, but notes that everybody\u2019s capable of contributing on an opportunistic unit.\n\n\u201cThose two guys have done a good job with (interceptions) and sacks, and both are athletic guys and experienced guys,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we have a number of those guys on our defense right now.\u201d\n\nClemson continues to set the defensive standard as it seeks a fourth consecutive ACC championship and second national title in three seasons.\n\nThe Tigers are tied for No. 1 nationally in scoring defense at 12.7 points per game and ranks second in yardage allowed at 253.6 yards per game.

The United States play England in an international friendly soccer match at Wembley stadium in London on Thursday. (AP Photo/Matt Dunham)\n\nLONDON (AP) \u2014 Back with the United States for only the second time in an injury-troubled year, Christian Pulisic has watched the Americans rebuild from afar after their failure to qualify for the World Cup.\n\n\u201cI definitely need to be a more important piece of this team and continue to grow as a leader,\u201d the 20-year-old midfielder said ahead of Thursday\u2019s friendly against England. \u201cIt\u2019s tough because I\u2019m not a very vocal guy, not super outgoing. But I think the biggest thing I can do is lead by example. I want to show these guys how it\u2019s done on a professional level.\u201d\n\nPulisic is talking like a veteran and yet only debuted in March 2016. The Hershey, Pennsylvania, native has 21 appearances and nine goals, the last in the 2-1 loss at Trinidad and Tobago in October 2017 that ended the American\u2019s streak of seven straight World Cups. Pulisic\u2019s only appearance since has been in a friendly against Bolivia in May.\n\nHis focus has been getting playing time at Borussia Dortmund, a task frustrated by injuries. Pulisic didn\u2019t even make the bench Saturday when Dortmund beat Bundesliga champion Bayern Munich 3-2 to stay atop the standings. Pulisic confirmed he was \u201c100 percent\u201d fit last weekend.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough. I had some injuries going on and off, and I got some games that I missed out,\u201d Pulisic he said Wednesday. \u201cWe have a great team this year. I want to be on the field just like everyone else does.\u201d\n\nPulisic inherited Landon Donovan\u2019s No. 10 jersey and his importance to the U.S. team.\n\nThe burden of pressure, too, at a young age, much like Wayne Rooney experienced with England. Now 33 and finishing his career in Major League Soccer, the D.C. United striker is making a one-off England return after a two-year absence and will make his 120th appearances.\n\n\u201cI can definitely look up to a guy like that,\u201d Pulisic said of Rooney, a five-time Premier League champion with Manchester United.\n\nRooney was part of an England \u201cgolden generation\u201d that failed to live up to the hype. With a more low-key approach and most players unscarred by past setbacks, England in July unexpectedly reached its first World Cup semifinal in 28 years.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an inspiration for us,\u201d Pulisic said. \u201cWe definitely feel that with the young side that we can we can also do something like that. That\u2019s the goal for us.\u201d\n\nPulisic has spoken with new U.S. team general manager Earnie Stewart, who says he will hire the next U.S. coach later this year, putting the new regime in place ahead of next year\u2019s CONCACAF Gold Cup. After that will be qualifying for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, and Pulisic figures to be in the prime of his career when the U.S. co-hosts the 2026 tournament with Canada and Mexico.\n\nThe American midfield of the future could be on the field together for the first time at Wembley: Pulisic, 19-year-old Tyler Adams and 20-year-old Weston McKennie, perhaps joined by Tim Weah, the 18-year-old son of former FIFA Player of the Year \u2014 and current Liberia president \u2014 George Weah.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of brave young players and guys who aren\u2019t afraid to come in and show us what they know about the game,\u201d Pulisic said. \u201cGuys can\u2019t come in to be shy and expect us to kind of show them the ropes. They\u2019ve got to come in and they\u2019ve got to show what they can do it and be competent with it.\u201d\n\nPulisic is friends with McKennie, also based in Germany. Adams is expected to move there, too, this winter, leaving MLS\u2019s New York Red Bulls for sister club RB Leipzig.\n\n\u201cWe want to help out the young guys ... as much as we can,\u201d Pulisic said. \u201cWe also still have a lot to learn.\u201d\n\nPlaying in Germany helps.\n\n\u201cThe Bundesliga has been a great platform,\u201d Pulisic said. \u201cThey trust their young players, and Dortmund has been an unbelievable start to my career.\u201d\n\nInevitably when visiting England, talk will turn to whether Pulisic envisages a move to the Premier League. His Dortmund contract ends in 2020.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still enjoying every moment of it,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the time comes, that\u2019s when I have my talks my Dortmund and see what I want to do moving forward.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "LANSING, Mich.

Buses and trucks are carrying some migrants into the state of Sinaloa along the Gulf of California and further northward into the border state of Sonora. The bulk of the main caravan appeared to be about 1,100 miles from the border, but was moving hundreds of miles per day. (AP Photo/Marco Ugarte)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on Wednesday defended the use of active duty troops on the U.S.-Mexican border, saying that in some ways it provides good training for war. He argued that it\u2019s analogous to a 1916 deployment to counter the Mexican revolutionary Gen. Francisco \u201cPancho\u201d Villa.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on his way to visit U.S. troops along the border in south Texas, Mattis declined to provide an estimate of how much the mission will cost. He said cost figures he has received thus far are \u201cnot anywhere near right.\u201d He added that he believes, \u201cvery quickly we\u2019ll know the real cost. So we\u2019ll keep you posted as the real costs come in.\u201d\n\nIn his most extensive remarks about the hastily arranged border mission, Mattis argued that it fits an historical pattern dating to early in the 20th century. He noted that President Woodrow Wilson deployed tens of thousands of National Guard and active duty troops to the border in 1916 in response to a Mexican military raid into the U.S.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s over a century ago, and the threat then was Pancho Villa\u2019s troops \u2014 revolutionary raiding across the border into the United States,\u201d he said. He noted that more recently, National Guard troops were used in border missions ordered by President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama, although not on the cusp of a midterm election.\n\nThe Pentagon chief said that within a week to 10 days the 5,800 troops currently deployed for the border mission will have accomplished all the tasks initially requested by Customs and Border Protection, although additional tasks are now being worked out between the Pentagon and the Department of Homeland Security. Mattis did not say how soon the mission might end; current deployments are scheduled to last until Dec. 15, but that could change.\n\nIn addition to the 5,800 active duty troops in the border area, about 2,100 National Guard troops have been providing border support since April.\n\nCritics have questioned the wisdom of using the military on the border where there is no discernible security threat, although President Donald Trump has said that a caravan of Central American migrants traveling northward through Mexico amounts to an \u201cinvasion.\u201d Since the election, Trump has said little about the matter, and no border threat has yet materialized.\n\nAsked whether he believes there is a security threat at the border that justifies the use of the active duty military, Mattis said he defers to the judgment of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, who joined him at the border Wednesday.\n\nNielsen and Mattis spoke with senior U.S. commanders and addressed rank-and-file troops. Mattis told the troops their mission is to \u201cback up\u201d Customs and Border Protection. \u201cRight now that\u2019s our role and that\u2019s all our role is,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe eyes of the world right now \u2014 certainly all of the Americans \u2014 are on you,\u201d Mattis told the soldiers, adding that they are part of a \u201cnon-traditional\u201d mission. \u201cWe\u2019re here because of the number of illegals who say they are going to illegally try to cross into our country,\u201d he said, apparently referring to the several thousand migrants moving north through Mexico.\n\nOne soldier asked Mattis what are the short- and long-term plans for the military mission.\n\nMattis said the short-term objective is to get sufficient numbers of wire and other barriers in place along the border as requested by Customs and Border Protection. The longer-term objective, he said, is \u201csomewhat to be determined.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re in something like this,\u201d Mattis said, \u201cit\u2019s dynamic, it\u2019s unpredictable. We\u2019ll have to see.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with reporters traveling with him to Texas, Mattis took issue with assertions by critics that the deployment undertaken shortly before the Nov. 6 midterm elections was costing the military in preparedness for combat. He said military officers have told him that the deployment has been \u201cvery good training\u201d because it amounts to a rehearsal for the kind of logistical demands \u2014 such as loading aircraft \u2014 that must be met in wartime.\n\n\u201cIn terms of readiness, it\u2019s actually, I believe, so far improving our readiness for deployments,\u201d he said.\n\nMattis said the mission, which does not include performing law enforcement tasks, was reviewed by Department of Justice lawyers and deemed a legal undertaking. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously a moral and ethical mission to support our border patrolmen,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nAP Radio correspondent Sagar Meghani contributed to this report.", "Sen.

The Devils won 4-2. (AP Photo/Julio Cortez)\n\nPITTSBURGH (AP) \u2014 Jim Rutherford celebrated a new contract in the most expected of ways: by putting together a trade he hopes will jump-start his struggling team.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Penguins general manager signed a contract extension on Wednesday that will keep him with the club through the 2021-22 season. Moments later he dealt forward Carl Hagelin to the Los Angeles Kings for forward Tanner Pearson.\n\nAll of it unfolded as Penguins captain Sidney Crosby skipped practice while being evaluated for an upper-body injury. Just another busy day for the 69-year-old Rutherford.\n\nThe only general manager to win Stanley Cups with multiple teams in the expansion era remains fervently committed to his job, which is why he didn\u2019t hesitate to make a trade that sent the speedy but slumping Hagelin to the Kings for the younger Pearson, the first of what could be several moves as Pittsburgh tries to shake itself out of a 7-6-3 start.\n\n\u201cDespite the fact it hasn\u2019t been a happy couple of weeks with the Penguins as a whole, I\u2019m very happy to be staying and will do my best to fix it,\u201d Rutherford said.\n\nThe Penguins hired Rutherford in the summer of 2014 to replace Ray Shero. Under his guidance, the Penguins revamped their roster and their coaching staff, surrounding Crosby and Evgeni Malkin with a talented group that helped Pittsburgh become the first franchise in nearly 20 years to win consecutive Stanley Cups in 2016 and 2017.\n\nHagelin scored the empty-net goal that clinched the 2017 Cup, racing down the ice in the final seconds of Game 6 to set off a giddy celebration on the bench. Yet Hagelin\u2019s production dipped last year. He finished with just 10 goals \u2014 the fewest in his career in a season in which he played at least 65 games \u2014 and had just one goal this year before the trade was announced.\n\n\u201cI feel bad,\u201d Rutherford said. \u201cCarl Hagelin is a very popular guy and I like him a lot personally ... at the same time we\u2019re not tracking toward winning a Stanley Cup right now and changes are necessary.\u201d\n\nHagelin is in the final season of a contract that pays him $4 million annually. Pearson, 26, has two more seasons left on his deal that is worth around $3.75 million per year. Pearson has averaged 40 points in each of the past three seasons, but had just one point \u2014 an assist \u2014 in 17 games with the Kings this season. He could be available as early as Thursday night when the Penguins host Tampa Bay.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s shown an ability to produce offensively ... he\u2019s a decent skater ... he\u2019s got a good 200-foot game,\u201d Pittsburgh coach Mike Sullivan said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see where we slot him here over the next little while.\u201d\n\nThe Penguins could certainly use a boost. They have dropped five of six, the longest extended slide of Rutherford\u2019s largely successful four-plus year tenure. The man nicknamed \u201cTrader Jim\u201d for his aggressive approach to addressing problems insists he still has plenty of juice left to keep going even as his 70th birthday approaches in February. It\u2019s a far cry from the day he was hired when he said he anticipated working a few more seasons.\n\n\u201cI said at the time I\u2019d probably be around a couple years,\u201d Rutherford said. \u201cI guess I went a couple years at a time. Two times two and we\u2019re still counting. You never know.\u201d\n\nFor now his attention is focused on helping the star-laden Penguins emerge from another early malaise.\n\nCrosby played more than 21 minutes and didn\u2019t miss a shift during Tuesday night\u2019s 4-2 loss to New Jersey. His absence at practice on Wednesday was a surprise, though Sullivan offered few details. It doesn\u2019t appear to be a long-term problem, however, though Pittsburgh\u2019s issues are far larger than just health. They are having trouble preventing goals and the offense for once isn\u2019t picking up the slack.\n\n\u201cI just think we\u2019re in a funk now, we\u2019re a fragile team,\u201d Rutherford said. \u201cWe\u2019re struggling but for the most part I still believe in this team. ...

(Gleiver Prieto/Katerina Harvati via AP)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Life as a Neanderthal was no picnic, but a new analysis says it was no more dangerous than what our own species faced in ancient times.\n\nThat challenges what the authors call the prevailing view of our evolutionary cousins, that they lived risky, stressful lives. Some studies have suggested they had high injury rates, which have been blamed on things like social violence, attacks by carnivores, a hunting style that required getting close to large prey, and the hazards of extensive travel in environments full of snow and ice.\n\nWhile it\u2019s true that their lives were probably riskier than those of people in today\u2019s industrial societies, the vastly different living conditions of those two groups mean comparing them isn\u2019t really appropriate, said Katerina Harvati of the University of Tuebingen in Germany.\n\nA better question is whether Neanderthals faced more danger than our species did when we shared similar environments and comparable lifestyles of mobile hunter-gatherers, she and study co-authors say in a paper released Wednesday by the journal Nature.\n\nTo study that, they focused on skull injuries. They reviewed prior studies of fossils from western Eurasia that ranged from about 80,000 to 20,000 years old. In all they assessed data on 295 skull samples from 114 individual Neanderthals, and 541 skull samples from 90 individuals of our own species, Homo sapiens.\n\nInjury rates turned out to be about the same in both species.\n\nThat questions the idea that the behavior of Neanderthals created particularly high levels of danger, Marta Mirazon Lahr of Cambridge University wrote in an accompanying commentary.\n\nBut the new study is not the final word on Neanderthal trauma, she wrote. It didn\u2019t include injuries other than to the skull. And scientists still have plenty of work to do in seeking the likely cause of injuries and evidence of care for the injured, which could give insights into the behavior of both Neanderthals and ancient members of our species, she wrote.\n\n___\n\nFollow Malcolm Ritter at @MalcolmRitter\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

A study released on Wednesday, Nov. 14, 2018 says that between being tripped up by downtown and the bigger effect of massive paving and building up of the metro area to reduce drainage, development in Houston on average increased the extreme flooding risk by 21 times. (AP Photo/LM Otero)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Humans helped make recent devastating U.S. hurricanes wetter but in different ways, two new studies find.\n\nHurricane Harvey snagged on the skyscrapers of Houston, causing it to slow and dump more rain than it normally would, one study found. The city\u2019s massive amounts of paving had an even bigger impact by reducing drainage. Land development in the metro area, on average, increased the chances of extreme flooding by 21 times, study authors said.\n\nA second study looked at last year\u2019s major Hurricanes Maria and Irma and 2005\u2032s deadly Katrina and used computer simulations to see what would have happened if there had been no human-caused global warming. The study found that climate change significantly increased rainfall from those three storms, but did not boost their wind speed.\n\nBoth studies are in Wednesday\u2019s journal Nature .\n\nHouston was a literal drag on Harvey as it sloshed through, with the storm getting tripped up by the skyscrapers, said study co-author Gabriele Villarini, a civil and environmental engineering professor at the University of Iowa.\n\nCo-author Gabe Vecchi, a climate scientist at Princeton University, said that forced the storm to move up higher, causing more concentrated rain over Houston and slowing, which also made more rain.\n\nHe compared it to a river running over rocks, creating bubbles.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s sort of what\u2019s going on here,\u201d he said.\n\nThis effect is dwarfed, though, by the paving and building that don\u2019t allow water to sink into the ground, Vecchi said.\n\nHarvey\u2019s record rainfall reached 5 feet in one spot near Houston. The scientists used computer simulations to see the effects of urbanization. In parts of the Houston metro area, the effects of development ranged from a 10 percent higher risk of extreme flooding in the less developed northwest to nearly 92 times the risk in the northeast, they reported.\n\nThat\u2019s on top of the unique weather patterns that made Harvey slow down and stall and climate change which brought more water into the storm, Vecchi said.\n\nMIT hurricane and climate expert Kerry Emanuel, who wasn\u2019t part of the study, called the Harvey study \u201ca real advance in our understanding of hurricane impacts on urban areas.\u201d\n\nBut Texas state climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon wasn\u2019t convinced. He said the team used generic shapes instead of the actual Houston skyline. He said the storm\u2019s wind speeds may have slowed, but that\u2019s different from the storm\u2019s forward movement slowing.\n\nThe other study in Nature looked at a variety of historical damaging storms and tried to calculate past and future effects of climate change. In three cases, the scientists simulated the storms without the changes in the climate from greenhouse gases, showing that global warming increased rainfall 8.9 percent in Hurricane Maria , 6.3 percent in Hurricane Irma and 8.7 percent in Hurricane Katrina .\n\nMaria hit Puerto and Rico and other parts of the Caribbean. Irma hit the Caribbean and Florida, while Katrina struck New Orleans and the Gulf Coast.\n\nIn Maria\u2019s case, a warming climate concentrated heavier rain in the center of the storm and reduced it on the edges, said co-author Michael Wehner, a climate scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.\n\nFor 15 storms, which included the devastating Typhoon Haiyan , the potent Gilbert and 1992\u2032s Hurricane Andrew , the scientists projected future warming and found future versions of the same storms would be significantly wetter and stronger.\n\n\u201cWe are beginning to see a climate change influence emerge on tropical cyclones and that\u2019s coming out as rainfall,\u201d said study lead author Christina Patricola, an atmospheric scientist at the national lab.\n\nAlthough replicating a storm in a different climate is difficult and can\u2019t account for certain changes, this work bolsters science understanding of how climate change alters hurricanes, Emanuel said.\n\n___\n\nFollow Seth Borenstein on Twitter: @borenbears .\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

Engel then edits the footage to be shown with the school's news program on Tuesdays. (Rhianna Gelhart/Gillette News Record via AP)\n\nGILLETTE, Wyo. (AP) \u2014 To kick off \u201cMingle with Engel\u201d is an image of a golden, spinning globe throwing off city names like Hong Kong, London, Dublin, Cairo and Seoul into space.\n\nThen comes the introduction and it\u2019s clear the show is from nowhere near those locations around the world. It\u2019s from Gillette, Wyoming, and centers around a school of about 1,100 students.\n\nAdam Engel sits in an office chair, spins around and doffs his glasses in one smooth movement, showing an intense game face. The gesture \u2014 now often copied among students \u2014 opens \u201cMingle with Engel\u201d each week, a show in which Engel is the cameraman, broadcaster, writer, editor and producer.\n\nThat whipping-off-his-glasses move \u2014 he calls it the \u201chead turn\u201d \u2014 only begins to tell the story.\n\nHis face shows his love of sports. It\u2019s apparent from the enthusiasm in his voice when he begins his always-gaining-speed spiel.\n\nIt\u2019s all part of a take-no-prisoners attitude that earned his show a cult following at his high school and around the community.\n\nEngel wonders if he should change the intro because he recently got a haircut. It\u2019s not an easy question to answer. After two years and about 40 YouTube videos, that intro \u2014 designed with the help of fellow student journalist Brayden Bryngelson, who\u2019s now in college \u2014 has morphed into a touchstone for Engel\u2019s fans.\n\nThat\u2019s the signal for Engel to enthusiastically spell out the sports results for the Thunder Basin High School Bolts each week whatever season it is. In the two- to four-minute program, he waves his arms, punches the air with a finger or his hand to make a point. His voice becomes louder as he tries to convey the enormity of the Bolts\u2019 accomplishments.\n\nSomething subtle and infectious is at work. It could be that he uses a fake microphone or stuffs tissues into the camera\u2019s rolling tripod to keep it upright. It could be that he changes T-shirts for each show \u2014 trumpeting Michigan State, a tie-dyed look or FBLA, for instance \u2014 that reflect his personality. Or it could simply be his enthusiasm.\n\nBut it grabs you.\n\n\u201cI love Adam. Adam is my favorite little dude,\u201d said Marcus Glick, a lineman on the school\u2019s football team.\n\nEngel\u2019s show, included with the TBHS journalism package of announcements and awards each week, is required viewing in weekly advocacy classes that are similar to a homeroom to discuss a variety of social or school issues and projects.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always fun because everybody loves Adam,\u201d said English instructor Jeri Anderson as her advocacy class watched Engel\u2019s show last week. \u201cWe were talking two weeks ago and they wondered what we\u2019ll do next year after Adam graduates and if someone will replace him.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone can replace him,\u201d she continued. \u201cFor Thunder Basin, he\u2019s a constant.\u201d\n\nEngel records his own sports scenes each weekend. He writes his script each Sunday in the kitchen or library of his home.\n\nThen he films himself delivering the sports news with descriptions ranging from \u201cmassacre\u201d to \u201cslayings\u201d early each Monday morning. He sits in a spare room in front of a green cloth background and equipment scrounged up by students and teachers. Other Thunder Basin students often pass by in the hallways and watch him work.\n\nA few hours later, he edits his own shows as part of his media literature class.\n\nThrough dedication and willingness to work at his craft, Engel has molded himself into a popular one-man expert on all things sports at Thunder Basin High School.\n\n\u201cWhen I watch his show, I think it\u2019s cool how a student is reporting sports news and stuff instead of a teacher. I think he\u2019s a relatable person, because sometimes he runs over words too fast. It makes him seem more down-to-earth, more relatable to your average Joe,\u201d freshman Cole Guseman said.\n\nEngel has some theories, but even he can\u2019t explain why his show has become such a hit.\n\nThe senior has produced his sports show weekly for the past two years while school is in session. He\u2019s missed only once a year ago when he was absent on a Monday.\n\n\u201cWhat really gets people interested, I don\u2019t know. I think it\u2019s the head turn. It\u2019s the glasses,\u201d he said.\n\nHe\u2019s been asked for his autograph twice. Athletes and students at Thunder Basin continually ask him when they\u2019ll be on his show.\n\nThat is all unexpected. But Engel points out that there is a 100 percent saturation at Thunder Basin for the target audience.\n\nStill, that doesn\u2019t explain the numbers of viewers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s his enthusiasm and his knowledge and his passion,\u201d said former Thunder Basin Principal Dennis Holmes. \u201cHe has made virtually his own legacy. That\u2019s important. I tell kids it\u2019s not what you do while you\u2019re here, it\u2019s what you leave.\u201d\n\nThe first show Sept. 22, 2017, drew 872 views. That was the night before Thunder Basin played the Camels in the first rivalry game between the two Gillette high schools.\n\nIn that show, Engel handled all of the broadcasting duties. Since then, Matt \u201cRat-a-tat\u201d Harris has taken on news duties and others announce the weekly Spark award winners. It\u2019s left Engel free to work on his unique sports show.\n\nSince then, viewer numbers have ranged from 35 to 368 per episode. This school year, there\u2019s been an average of more than 200 viewers each show because of the advocacy class. That represents each class showing the video. It\u2019s not a count of every individual student who watches.\n\nIn reality, his numbers each week are close to the all-time highest viewed video from TBHS journalism, the 2018 lip dub that has 1,500 views.\n\n\u201cHe has quite the following,\u201d said journalism teacher Claire Carter. \u201cWhen he walks down the hall, there\u2019s often kids giving him high fives.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s gotten quite good,\u201d she added. \u201cHe is a unique talent. He\u2019s such a success story.\u201d\n\nThat isn\u2019t why Engel got into this, though. He had other motivations.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s never really played any sports but he knows more than I do about some of that stuff. I didn\u2019t know the one call during the game and he told me what the call was and he told me why they called it like that. He\u2019s so smart and it\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d football player Brendan Jordan said.\n\nEngel jokes that he was holding the sports section of the newspaper in his hands just a few months after being born. He was too young to read but looked at the photos.\n\n\u201cMy mom says I came out of the womb destined to do something with sports,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve always been a stat nerd. ... I\u2019m the type of guy who could talk sports all day long.\u201d\n\nHe wants to be a play-by-play broadcaster and produce a sports show. The senior looks up to NBC Sports hockey play-by-play man Mike \u201cDoc\u201d Emrick and his dream since sixth grade is to reach an ESPN-level job.\n\n\u201cMingle with Engel\u201d is his way of \u201cgetting my foot in the door,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I\u2019m open to everything. I\u2019m willing to get better.\u201d\n\nHis talent has progressed this school year, as has his popularity. He was chosen as homecoming king for Thunder Basin High School.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t always that way.\n\nHe was diagnosed with Asperger\u2019s syndrome on the autism spectrum as a young boy, he said. As a result, he underwent speech therapy through fifth grade.\n\nNow, he may communicate through slight pauses in his delivery as he makes sure he pronounces words correctly. Those pauses have become less frequent as he reads his scripts.\n\nIt\u2019s all about practice, Engel said, which he\u2019s doing a lot of these days.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t normally interview sports figures for his show but recently made an exception, interviewing the \u201cWyoming Guy\u201d who hopes to visit all of the state\u2019s 65 high school sports stadiums this year.\n\nEngel presented the young man a Bolts T-shirt embossed with \u201cthe Wyoming Guy\u201d on back and then questioned why the Wyoming Guy, a Kemmerer native who now lives in Colorado, wants to visit all the Wyoming stadiums and has added 4,000 miles to his car\u2019s odometer while doing so.\n\nHis humor and the interview are a hoot. Those in doubt should note the show where he played the theme from \u201cSuper Mario Bros.\u201d to illustrate the climbing score in a game.\n\nYes, Engel has his own style.\n\n\u201cA lot of times I like to use alliteration,\u201d he said. \u201cI really try to develop my own style, if you will.\u201d\n\nAs in: \u201cFriday night in Casper the Bolts football team slayed the Kelly Walsh Trojans in the very windy, windy city of Casper, Wyoming.\u201d\n\nOr \u201cthe massacre\u201d of the Bolts\u2019 50-0 win on one week.\n\nAdam grapples with many issues teens his age do.

(Randy Tucker/Riverton Ranger via AP)\n\nRIVERTON, Wyo. (AP) \u2014 It was known simply as Red Rocks a generation ago, the restaurant and motel on the north side of U.S. Highway 26 just before the big curve 20 miles east of Dubois.\n\nWhile the meals may have been memorable, what goes on inside the former restaurant and motel complex is unexpected.\n\nBen Barto, a Wyoming native originally from Rock Springs, has created a quiet industry along the Wind River that produces world-quality knives, ornaments, pins and just about anything else you can imagine from elk and deer antlers.\n\n\u201cWe take a basic hunting knife and turn it into a work of art,\u201d Barto said.\n\nThe enterprise produces unique wildlife-based art but has another special purpose in supporting veterans and veteran organizations across the state and the nation.\n\nThe walls of the company office, adjacent to the showroom, clearly display the respect and dedication to veterans that is the focus of Barto\u2019s efforts.\n\n\u201cAfter spending time with these veterans, hearing their stories and learning that roughly 23 veterans commit suicide every day, I knew I needed to figure out a way to help,\u201d Barto said.\n\nHelp he has in a variety of ways, most notably through his brainchild, \u201cHorns for Heroes.\u201d\n\nHorns for Heroes is an all-volunteer project designed to help veterans through the sale and donation of antlers and antler-based products.\n\nThe hunting tradition runs strong in Wyoming, and most hunters have deer, elk and moose antlers hanging around the garage, the shop or barn. These horns can be donated to help local American Legion posts.\n\nBarto has five sanctioned horn buyers he works with. If a supply of antlers is large enough, a buyer will meet the seller, sort, weigh and value the antlers then write a check to the local American Legion for 50 cents below the current spot price for the horns.\n\nAntlers come in grades of A, B and C with the A and B grades newer, harder horns with some or all of the original color still in them. C-grade antlers are older, have lost most of their original tint and often have a chalky appearance. The grade doesn\u2019t matter; all of them are marketable, and Barto has a use for every one of them.\n\nAn interesting product sold and marketed directly from his Red Rocks location is antler dog treats. Barto\u2019s staff takes raw antlers, cuts them to dog-bone-sized lengths and packages them for local sales or worldwide distribution.\n\n\u201cThe difference between wholesale and retail of all dog treat sales go to veterans,\u201d Barto said.\n\nThe antler treats are a favorite treat for dogs and last a long time. Barto markets these wholesale to large retail sporting and pet supply outlets.\n\nDog treats are good source of revenue for veterans organizations, but Barto is much more an artist than an entrepreneur.\n\n\u201cMy skills are in designing and creating art,\u201d Barto said. \u201cThe business side, I\u2019m just not that good at it.\u201d\n\nBarto started in the antler-carving business as a hobby just a few years after graduating from Rock Springs High School in 1971.\n\nHe was working for Pacific Power during the construction of a line from Rock Springs to Medford, Oregon, in 1974 when he began to carve antlers as a hobby in his free time. Over the next few years his hobby developed into a passion. He began to buy antlers and in 1982 purchased a hand-crafted resin and hand-painted wildlife hat pin business from artist Brent Barret.\n\nHe began carving and hired 11 sub-contractors to mold and paint products. He began wholesaling pins to Cabela\u2019s, and his carving business picked up. He began buying more antlers as well.\n\nIn 1991 he purchased the Red Rock Lodge. He began holding concerts in 1995 with Steppenwolf, Nazareth, the Ozark Mountain Daredevils, Gary Allen and Mark Chestnut performing over the next few years.\n\nIn 1998 he met and later married Sherry Moser, also an artist, and the couple decided to close the bar and enlarge their pin business into magnets and Christmas tree ornaments.\n\nBarto\u2019s creative side kicked into high gear and he began designing wine holds from antlers, tree toppers and even patented an antler Christmas tree. His buyers expanded from Cabela\u2019s to Bass Pro Shop, Gander Mountain, Sportsman\u2019s Warehouse and Ace Hardware along with hundreds of gift shops across the west. At peak production they were creating 400,000 pins a year after moving the molding production to China.\n\nIn 2000 he hired Chance and Kelly Phelps, a couple of Dubois High School students, to hand-paint wildlife pins. Both brother and sister joined the military, and Chance, a Marine, was killed in action in Iraq on April 9, 2004.\n\nIt was a tragic event that enhanced Barto\u2019s respect, admiration and interest in veterans\u2019 lives after they returned from service.\n\nHe helped Chance\u2019s mother, Gretchen Mack, in supporting the Chance Phelps Foundation she started in her son\u2019s honor.\n\nThe story of Chance Phelps was retold in the film \u201cTaking Chance\u201d starring Kevin Bacon.\n\nBarto made custom hat pins for the surviving Doolittle Raiders and built a knife for the late Samuel T. Holiday, one of the only two remaining Navajo code talkers, when Holiday was 98. Dick Cole, age 103, presented Barto with a Doolittle coin later.\n\nOne afternoon at a \u201cRocking the Winds\u201d fundraiser at Crowheart, Barto watched double-amputee Green Beret Dana Bowman parachute into a nearby field and was inspired once again.\n\nBowman is now a member of the Horns for Heroes Board of Directors. Jeff Milton of Dubois, a veteran and now a real-estate agent, is a member of the board along with Goran Berndtsson, a Swedish businessman who designs and markets personal protective equipment across the world.\n\nThe exterior of the Red Rock facility is traditional red painted logs that are common in buildings along the upper Wind River Valley but inside is a state-of-the-art production and distribution facility.\n\nPallets of antlers weighing 1,200 pounds each are bundled and awaiting shipment across the nation. A store room of complete art work awaits customers who select knives, pins and ornaments from the myriad displays in well-lit, mirrored showcases.\n\nIn the bowels of the building Barto and his staff work with Dremel tools, sanders and stains to put the perfect finish on a handmade antler handle destined to be mated with a stainless or Damascus steel blade, but a surprise awaits in one of the work rooms in the back.\n\nTwo industrial lasers, one a fine-tuned fiber optic device, cut laminated birch panels into custom ornaments and the other engraves knife blades, antlers, handles and even items as tiny as shell cases with the Horns for Heroes trademark or any other design or name a customer may choose.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The (Riverton, Wyo.)

His lawyer said the case stems from a misunderstanding about a land investment in Oregon.\n\n\u201cThe statute is really clear. The president is violating the appointments clause,\u201d Pariente said, pointing to the federal Vacancies Reform Act and the Constitution requirement for U.S. Senate confirmation of the attorney general.\n\nJustice Department officials did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment about the Tuesday filing in U.S. District Court in Davenport, Iowa.\n\nHowever, the department on Wednesday released a 20-page internal legal opinion supporting Trump\u2019s appointment of Whitaker after former U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions was forced out a week ago.\n\nThe move elevated Whitaker over Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to become the nation\u2019s chief law enforcement officer without Senate confirmation.\n\nWhitaker had been confirmed by the Senate in 2004 as U.S. attorney in Iowa. But Pariente maintained that confirmation didn\u2019t carry over to the top Justice Department job.\n\nThe state of Maryland has also challenged Whitaker\u2019s appointment, arguing that the post must be held by a Senate-confirmed official such as Rosenstein, and congressional Democrats have called the appointment unconstitutional.\n\nThe Justice Department opinion says that even without Senate confirmation, Whitaker may serve as acting attorney general because he has been at the department for more than a year at a \u201csufficiently senior pay level.\u201d\n\nPariente, in an interview, acknowledged his client\u2019s challenge was a longshot.

Twenty-nine more plaintiffs have joined one of the two lawsuits filed against Ohio State University by alumni who say they were victims of sexual misconduct by Strauss during the two decades he worked there. Counting the allegations added Tuesday, Nov. 13, 2018, the lawsuits allege more than 20 school officials and employees, including athletic directors, knew concerns about Dr. Richard Strauss but didn't stop him. .(Ohio State University via AP, File)\n\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) \u2014 Alumni who say they\u2019re victims of sexual misconduct by an Ohio State University team doctor allege more than 20 school officials and staff, including two athletic directors, knew of concerns about how the physician treated young men but didn\u2019t stop him.\n\nThe list of such employees grew Tuesday as 29 plaintiffs were added to one of the two pending lawsuits alleging Ohio State didn\u2019t deal appropriately with the now-deceased doctor, Richard Strauss. He is accused of unnecessarily groping scores of athletes and others under the guise of medical care during his two decades at the school.\n\nFormer tennis player Ron McDaniel said he is frustrated that Ohio State didn\u2019t do more to stop Strauss back when players voiced concerns to coaches or administrators, as McDaniel and some fellow plaintiffs in the updated lawsuit say they did.\n\nOhio State is \u201cgreat in a lot of things, but when it came to protecting them from this guy . they didn\u2019t do a very good job of protecting us,\u201d McDaniel said in an interview.\n\nThe university has sought to dismiss the lawsuits as being time-barred by law but insists it is not ignoring the men\u2019s stories. The allegations raised this year prompted Ohio State to have an outside law firm investigate .\n\nThe school is aiming \u201cto thoroughly and carefully pursue the truth about what happened during Strauss\u2019 time at Ohio State and what university leaders at the time knew,\u201d spokesman Ben Johnson said in an email Wednesday. \u201cWe do not tolerate sexual misconduct and pledge to appropriately address the findings of the investigation.\u201d\n\nStrauss killed himself in 2005. His relatives have said they are shocked by the allegations.\n\nEmployment records released by the university reflect no major concerns about Strauss. But alumni say they complained about him as far back as the late 1970s, and Ohio State has at least one documented complaint from 1995.\n\nSome of the newest plaintiffs told their coaches or trainers about inappropriate behavior by Strauss, but little came of that, according to their lawsuit. Those plaintiffs include a swimmer who said Strauss kissed his neck and back while massaging him before a swim meet, and a fencer who said he was told by a female coach that she would talk to someone about Strauss after hearing concerns.\n\nAnother male athlete, Kelly Reed, raised concerns with several track and field coaches and with Buckeyes football star-turned-administrator Archie Griffin while he was assistant athletic director, according to the lawsuit. Griffin told Reed he would look into the situation, but Reed never heard of any follow-up or action taken against Strauss, the lawsuit said.\n\nGriffin is retired. Messages seeking comment from him were left Wednesday via phone and email, and with an attorney who has represented him in another lawsuit.\n\nAnother plaintiff, an ex-wrestler, alleges Strauss made a sexual proposition to him while examining a groin injury in the late 1970s. Embarrassed and angry, the wrestler said, he declined. He told The Associated Press that he reported it to now-deceased wrestling coach Chris Ford but doesn\u2019t know whether Ford did anything with the information.\n\nA second fencer from the early 1990s told the AP that at his first physical exam with Strauss, the doctor told him to fully disrobe, complimented his collar bones, and then sat with his head near the athlete\u2019s crotch and commented about being in a vulnerable position. The athlete said that he told a trainer about it and got the impression that the trainer would address it with the doctor, but that he never heard anything further.\n\nThat former fencer and the ex-wrestler consider their experiences to be sexual abuse and discussed them with the AP on condition of anonymity. The AP generally doesn\u2019t identify victims of sexual abuse without their consent.\n\nThey say they are pursuing accountability from Ohio State and want to make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again.\n\nThey also hope to push for transparency from the school and \u201cto encourage people that there is an avenue to have their story told, to help contribute to the fight to change this practice and this policy of indifference,\u201d said Jack Landskroner, one of their attorneys.\n\nAt least 150 ex-students have alleged sexual misconduct by Strauss between 1979 and 1997. The allegations under investigation involve Ohio State male athletes from at least 16 sports and Strauss\u2019 work at the student health center and his off-campus medical office .\n\nThe U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights also is examining how the university responded to students\u2019 complaints about Strauss.\n\nOhio State is encouraging anyone with information to contact the investigators from Seattle-based Perkins Coie. The firm isn\u2019t proactively reaching out to possible victims, citing concern for potentially re-traumatizing them.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press reporter Andrew Welsh-Huggins contributed to this report.

Nancy Pelosi all but dared potential rivals for the gavel to come forward, a group of restive House Democrats vowed Wednesday to produce enough votes to block her from becoming the House\u2019s new speaker.\n\nFor two days now, disgruntled Democrats have claimed they have 17 names on a letter opposing Pelosi\u2019s leadership, promising to air the document soon. They say those signing on are pledging to vote against the Californian when the full chamber elects the next speaker on Jan. 3.\n\nRep. Kathleen Rice, D-N.Y., confirmed the letter Tuesday, and an aide to an organizer of the effort said it stood at 17 names as of Wednesday. The aide was not authorized to discuss the letter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nPelosi, asked by a reporter about her message to rebellious colleagues, challenged them to put forward an alternate candidate for speaker.\n\n\u201cCome on in, the water\u2019s warm,\u201d she said.\n\nDemocrats seeking to block Pelosi argue it\u2019s time to give younger Democrats a chance to rise to high-level posts. They also say that Republicans have done such a good job demonizing her in campaign ads that it\u2019s hard for Democrats to be elected in closely contested, moderate districts.\n\nNo challenger to Pelosi has emerged, but the group agitating for changes at the top of party leadership says there would be plenty of candidates should her bid be derailed.\n\n\u201cThe first step is showing that she cannot get to 218, and then I believe the challengers will emerge,\u201d Rice told reporters. She said that would make new members \u201cfeel more comfortable that they\u2019re not just taking a no vote just to take a no vote.\u201d\n\nBut Pelosi is one of her party\u2019s most productive fundraisers, energetic campaigners and respected legislative tacticians, giving her wide support that will make her difficult to topple.\n\n\u201cI will be speaker,\u201d she said Wednesday.\n\nWhile simple math would say the 17 names would be enough to deny Pelosi a majority, other factors are at play. To win on the floor, a speaker needs 218 votes, under typical circumstances, but with absences or members voting present, the tally is reduced. As of now, Democrats hold 229 seats and Republicans hold 198, but several races remain undecided, so the Democratic number could grow. That gives Pelosi a margin of about a dozen or more seats, assuming all Republicans vote against her as expected.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got enough to ensure that she cannot become speaker,\u201d said Rep. Kurt Schrader, D-Ore.\n\nThe efforts to block Pelosi are led by a core group of incumbent Democrats opposed to her, but some newly elected lawmakers pledged during their campaigns to do the same.\n\nOne veteran lawmaker who signed the letter, Rep. Marcia Fudge, D-Ohio, told reporters that colleagues have urged her to run for speaker.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to allow the Republicans to have a speaker, so certainly there will be someone that will step up\u201d if Pelosi steps aside, Fudge said. \u201cAnd those discussions are going on now.\u201d\n\nEven so, some divisions were emerging among the Pelosi opponents.\n\nRep.

(AP Photo/Butch Dill, File)\n\nNAPLES, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Ariya Jutanugarn is occasionally fearful on the golf course, which might seem peculiar given her resume.\n\nShe\u2019s already clinched the LPGA\u2019s player of the year award, her second in the last three seasons. She\u2019s already clinched the money title, also for the second time in three years. She\u2019s back to No. 1 in the world rankings, will almost certainly have the lowest scoring average on tour this year and finished in the top 10 more regularly than any of her fellow competitors.\n\nIf all that wasn\u2019t enough, she has the best chance this week at the season-ending tour championship that starts Thursday at Tiburon Golf Club of capturing the Race to the CME Globe \u2014 which comes with a $1 million bonus.\n\nSo still playing scared at times, that\u2019s a puzzler.\n\n\u201cI just want to improve myself every day,\u201d Jutanugarn said. \u201cI know I have so much room (to) improve. ... Every time when I go out and play I always have some different situation. Sometimes I worry. Sometimes I\u2019m scared. Sometimes I feel so confident to play golf.\u201d\n\nThe confident moments seem like they override the worrisome and fearful ones.\n\nShe got hot at the right time in 2018 \u2014 winning twice in May, the second of those being the U.S. Women\u2019s Open, then grabbing the Scottish Open victory in July. She\u2019s been tied for third or better in three of her last four starts, and went 67-67 on the weekend to prevail at the tour championship on this southwest Florida track last year.\n\nJutanugarn won\u2019t carry a driver this week \u2014 she\u2019s 122nd this season in driving accuracy \u2014 but she seems to rarely have trouble scoring. She leads the LPGA in birdies, is third in putting average and is even 13th in driving distance despite her disdain for using what ordinarily is the biggest club in the bag.\n\n\u201cI want to play well, I want to hit this shot good because I care about other people, what they\u2019re going to be thinking about me,\u201d Jutanugarn said. \u201cBut then I have to come back to myself and know that other people\u2019s expectation is not my expectation. I have to know what is my expectation, because I expect to have a good commitment with every shot. I expect myself to have fun, enjoy, and feel free on the course.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s one of five women in the field who have the simplest path to winning the CME Globe: Win the tournament, and the trophy and bonus are theirs. Minjee Lee, Brooke Henderson, Nasa Hataoka and Sung Hyun Park are the others; five who are assured of winning the Globe if they win the tournament. There are seven other women with a mathematical chance,\n\n\u201cOne of my main goals this year was to be in the top five coming into this event so that I could have this opportunity,\u201d Henderson said. \u201cI\u2019ve been really fortunate that for the past three years I\u2019ve been in position if I play well this week that I could walk away with that $1 million, which is pretty special. I think it all comes down to you need to have a really great week.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the third consecutive year where Henderson has come to Naples \u2014 she\u2019s Canadian, but now has a home about 30 minutes away from Tiburon \u2014 with a chance to win the Globe and the bonus money.\n\nShe still doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019d do if she won the extra $1 million.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been asked that the last three years, and I\u2019m still not really sure,\u201d Henderson said. \u201cBut just the opportunity to be here, I\u2019m really grateful.

A study released by a Native American non-profit says numerous police departments in cities nationwide are not adequately identifying or reporting cases of missing and murdered indigenous women. (AP Photo/David Goldman, File)\n\nALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) \u2014 Numerous police departments nationwide are not adequately identifying or reporting cases of missing and murdered indigenous women and girls as concerns mount over the level of violence they often face, according to a study released by a Native American nonprofit Wednesday.\n\nThe report from the Seattle-based Urban Indian Health Institute, the research arm of the Seattle Indian Health Board, was conducted over the past year amid worry in tribal communities and cities that Native American and Alaska Native women are vanishing in high numbers, despite limited government data to identify the full scope of the problem.\n\nU.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a Republican from Alaska, joined other lawmakers and representatives of the Urban Indian Health Institute to review the report\u2019s findings at a news conference in Washington. Its release comes as multiple bills at the state and federal level have been proposed to address the issue and improve data collection, including Savanna\u2019s Act, which the U.S. Senate Committee on Indian Affairs voted Wednesday to send to the full chamber for consideration.\n\nThe bill would expand tribal access to some federal crime databases, establish protocols for handling cases of missing and murdered Native Americans, and require annual reports on the number of missing and murdered Native American women.\n\n\u201cWe simply don\u2019t have a grasp of the extent of the problem we\u2019re dealing with,\u201d Murkowski said. \u201cMaking sure that we do not have these gaps in reporting is going to be a critical and important first step.\u201d\n\nThe authors of the Seattle nonprofit\u2019s report said they identified some 500 missing persons and homicide cases involving Native American women in 71 cities after reviewing data obtained through media reports and public records requests sent to police departments.\n\nThey reviewed cases dating back to the 1940s, though roughly two-thirds were from the past eight years, according to Annita Lucchesi, a cartographer and descendant of the Southern Cheyenne whose database of missing and murdered indigenous women in the U.S. and Canada was the basis for the research.\n\nIn total, she has a list of some 2,700 names. Of the cases included in the report on U.S. cities, a quarter represented missing persons cases, and just more than half were homicides.\n\nResearchers said they expect their figures represent an undercount, in part, because some police departments in cities with substantial Native American populations \u2014 such as Albuquerque and Billings, Montana \u2014 did not provide figures in response to records requests, or because Native American victims may have been identified as belonging to another race.\n\nPolice in Albuquerque and Billings did not immediately respond to The Associated Press\u2019 requests for comment.\n\n\u201cWhat it does show is, yes, this is happening,\u201d said Abigail Echo-Hawk, who is the director of the Urban Indian Health Institute. \u201cBut there has to be major changes to the way data is collected.\u201d\n\nSome efforts to improve data collection at different levels of government are already underway.\n\nIn Washington state, for example, a law was enacted in June that requires the State Patrol to conduct a study to examine how to improve the collection and sharing of information about missing Native American women. The study also will develop an estimate of how many Native women are missing in the state. A report to the Legislature is expected in June.\n\nIn Congress, meanwhile, Savanna\u2019s Act is among several proposals drafted to address cases involving missing and murdered Native American and Alaska Native women.\n\nA proposal for reauthorizing the Violence Against Women\u2019s Act also calls for annual reports on the number of missing and murdered Native Americans.\n\nSavanna\u2019s Act was introduced last year by North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat who lost her bid for re-election last week. She named the bill Savanna\u2019s Act in honor of Savanna LaFontaine-Greywind, a 22-year-old who was brutally killed in Fargo, North Dakota, in 2017 while eight months pregnant.\n\nHer neighbor Brooke Crews admitted to the killing and was sentenced to life in prison without parole earlier. Her boyfriend William Hoehn was sentenced last month to life in prison with a chance at parole for conspiring to kidnap the baby and lying to police about it.\n\nThe child survived and lives with her father.\n\nHeitkamp has said that if authorities had more accurate statistics, they might be able to detect patterns to help solve more cases. The authors of the nonprofit\u2019s report share that opinion, but also point out that the legislation\u2019s data collection mandates likely would not include LaFontaine-Greywind herself.\n\nThat\u2019s because the bill would largely set mandates for federal law enforcement, which has some jurisdiction over crimes on reservations and other tribal lands but not municipalities, like Fargo.\n\nThe report underscores U.S. Census figures showing that a majority of Native Americans now live in urban areas. The study said that shows the need for including consideration of cases stemming from cities in reforms.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press national writer Sharon Cohen in Chicago contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow Hudetz on Twitter at https://twitter.com/marymhudetz\n\n___\n\nRead AP\u2019s full coverage on missing Native American women: https://apnews.com/tag/MissingInIndianCountry", "SANFORD, Maine (AP) \u2014 Federal authorities are searching for a suspect in a drug case who fled after being released from jail and is considered \u201carmed and dangerous.\u201d\n\nThe Portland Press Herald reports the FBI\u2019s Southern Maine Gang Task Force said Wednesday they were offering a reward for information about Joshua Weldon\u2019s whereabouts.\n\nWeldon was arrested by the FBI in August and charged with conspiracy to distribute fentanyl.

Volkswagen and other car makers had bet heavily on diesel models, which get better mileage than gasoline powered vehicles, to meet tough limits on emissions of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas scientists say causes global warming.

Subsequent scrutiny of diesel technology showed that other carmakers\u2019 vehicle emitted more nitrogen oxide pollution in real-life driving than during tests. The EU introduced new test procedures Sept. 1 that are intended to measure emissions in daily driving conditions.\n\nAs diesel sales fall carmakers are turning to electric vehicles to meeting the new C02 limits, even though consumer uptake has been slow because of higher costs and lack of convenient places to charge up.

Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., speaks with reporters before he and Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., try to bring up the legislation to protect special counsel Robert Mueller, at the Capitol in Washington, Wednesday, Nov. 14, 2018. Senate Republicans are facing renewed pressure to pass legislation to protect Mueller, with a handful of GOP senators urging their leadership to hold a vote now that President Donald Trump has pushed out Attorney General Jeff Sessions. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Republican Sen. Jeff Flake said Wednesday that he won\u2019t vote to confirm judicial nominees unless GOP leaders hold a vote on legislation to protect special counsel Robert Mueller from being fired.\n\nFlake of Arizona and Democratic Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware went to the Senate floor on Wednesday and tried to bring the legislation up for a vote. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell objected. McConnell has said that the legislation is unnecessary because he believes Mueller won\u2019t be fired.\n\nFlake and Coons called for the vote in the wake of Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019 departure. President Donald Trump pushed Sessions out last week and temporarily replaced him with a loyalist, Matt Whitaker, who has criticized the Mueller investigation. The special counsel\u2019s probe is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and Russian ties to Trump\u2019s Republican campaign.\n\n\u201cThis is not a moment for our leadership to be weak or irresolute or compromised in any way,\u201d Flake said, adding that \u201cthe president now has this investigation in his sights and we all know it.\u201d\n\nHe said the appointment of Whitaker was a \u201cblatant\u201d move that increased the urgency for the legislation.\n\nFlake, who retires in January, said he wouldn\u2019t vote to confirm judges on the Senate floor or to advance them out of committee until there was a vote on the Mueller bill. He said he\u2019d continue to come to the Senate floor to call for one.\n\nMcConnell objected without comment. But he said earlier Wednesday that he\u2019s never heard anyone at the White House suggest they want to shut the investigation down.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s in no danger, so I don\u2019t think any legislation is necessary,\u201d McConnell said.\n\nThe move by Flake and Coons comes more than a year after the bipartisan legislation was introduced and underscores the deep concerns many lawmakers have long had over Trump\u2019s comments about Mueller\u2019s investigation. Trump has repeatedly called the probe a \u201choax\u201d and leveled personal criticism at the former FBI director. Those concerns were only amplified after Trump appointed Whitaker as acting attorney general.\n\nWhitaker is now overseeing the probe, which had previously been overseen by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Rosenstein told Congress that he saw no reason to fire Mueller.\n\nSessions had recused himself from overseeing Mueller because he worked on Trump\u2019s campaign \u2014 a decision that infuriated Trump and led to Sessions\u2019 resignation.\n\nSeveral other Republicans have said they would vote for the special counsel bill. They include Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, Maine Sen. Susan Collins and the legislation\u2019s GOP co-sponsors, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham and North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis.\n\nDemocrats, who will take the House majority in January, have also said shielding Mueller\u2019s investigation will be one of their top priorities. Along with Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, they have called for the special counsel bill to be added to a year-end spending bill that must pass in December to avoid a partial government shutdown.\n\nThe bipartisan legislation to protect Mueller was approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee in April. It would give any special counsel a 10-day window to seek expedited judicial review of a firing and put into law existing Justice Department regulations that a special counsel can only be fired for good cause.\n\nDespite some GOP support, it\u2019s unclear if the measure could gain 60 votes in the Senate \u2014 and even less clear that Trump would sign a bill that contained the legislation. Flake and Coons said they were certain they could get 60 votes and noted that Trump has changed his mind on legislation before.\n\nOn Tuesday, Grassley said that he would leave the decision up to McConnell but that \u201cif it comes to a vote, I will vote for that bill.\u201d Graham, who is close to Trump, said he doesn\u2019t expect Mueller to be fired, \u201cbut it would probably be good to have this legislation in place just for the future.\u201d Tillis said he was talking to other senators about how they might be able to get it done.\n\nCollins said passage of the bill would \u201csend a powerful message that Mr. Mueller must be able to complete his work unimpeded.\u201d\n\nMueller\u2019s investigation has already resulted in six guilty pleas, a trial conviction and pending charges against more than two dozen others, including Russian intelligence officers.\n\nAccording to a new court filing Wednesday, the investigation could go on for several more months. Prosecutors say they\u2019re not ready for Trump campaign aide Rick Gates to be sentenced because he is continuing to cooperate with \u201cseveral ongoing investigations.\u201d And they\u2019re asking a federal judge to give them until mid-January to offer another update about his case.\n\nGates pleaded guilty this year to two felonies as part of the probe. Gates\u2019 mentor, ex-Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, was convicted this year on eight counts of tax and bank fraud. He is also cooperating.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Chad Day and Matthew Daly contributed to this report.", "CORRECTS LAST NAME TO PROUDFIT FROM PROUD - In this July 2, 2012 photo, Kids Against Hunger founder Richard Proudfit works at the company headquarters in New Hope, Minn.

In 1987, he founded Feed My Starving Children, a Christian-based nonprofit that has sent more than 2 billion meals to children and families in 70 countries since its inception.\n\nAn entrepreneur and philanthropist, Proudfit assembled scientists from General Mills, Cargill and other companies to create a food product that met nutritional requirements for the malnourished, the Star Tribune reported .

The developer who took over the project from Whitaker ultimately pulled out of the affordable housing agreement and fully refunded the city for its $165,000 loan.\n\nToday, all 22 units in the complex are being rented at market rates that are higher than what the city envisioned when Whitaker\u2019s company was awarded the affordable housing loan in 2012.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of development on Ingersoll Avenue right now, and most of it is going market rate. We were trying to preserve some affordable housing,\u201d Johansen said. \u201cIt is a loss for that corridor.\u201d\n\nWhitaker\u2019s abandonment of the project is the latest concern about his record that has arisen since his appointment by President Donald Trump last week. Critics have assailed him for his ties to a Florida company that has been accused of scamming investors, his prior comments critical of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation, and his botched prosecution of a gay Democratic state senator in Iowa. Whether his appointment is constitutional is also the subject of legal challenges.\n\nJohansen spoke one day after The Associated Press reported that the city terminated Whitaker\u2019s loan agreement in 2016 and a bank declared him in default on a nearly $700,000 mortgage after he stopped work on the building.\n\nAt least four contractors also had complained that Whitaker hadn\u2019t paid them for thousands of dollars in completed projects on the building. While the city got its money back, it\u2019s unclear whether the bank and the contractors were repaid in full.\n\nThe agreement between the city and Whitaker\u2019s company, MEM Investment, called for at least 11 of the units to be restricted to low-income tenants for five years. Monthly rents were to be capped at $631 with utilities for a one-bedroom and $783 for a two-bedroom, and only individuals earning below 60 percent of the median income were to be eligible. If those requirements were met, all but $25,000 of the loan would have been forgiven.\n\nWhen Whitaker walked away from the project, he sold the building to another developer for $650,000. That developer completed the work but pulled out of the affordable housing plan, selling the building for $1.6 million in 2017 to another owner.\n\nToday, apartment listings show that a two-bedroom in the building is going for $1,000 per month, while a one-bedroom flat is $700.\n\nThe city didn\u2019t have to repay any funding to U.S. Housing and Urban Development because it was able to use the money for other projects, Johansen said.\n\nWhitaker met with state and local law enforcement officials in Des Moines on Wednesday and spoke at a conference on elder abuse. He didn\u2019t address his development project and wasn\u2019t made available for questions.\n\nOn Tuesday night, a Department of Justice spokeswoman said Whitaker didn\u2019t complete the project because of cost overruns and an unidentified \u201cbad general contractor.\u201d A message left for a handyman who is identified in documents as the general contractor hasn\u2019t been returned.\n\nDocuments released Wednesday show that city officials tried to work with Whitaker throughout 2015 to finish the project but were unsuccessful. The city in October 2015 obtained a one-year extension from HUD that pushed the completion deadline back to December 2016.\n\nSenior city planner Mary Neiderbach warned Whitaker at that time that the city wanted to see progress in the coming months. The city pulled the plug on the loan in April 2016 after the building appeared to be abandoned and was suffering additional water damage.\n\n___\n\nThis story corrects the spelling of Johansen in one reference.", "HORTONVILLE, Wis.

R. 5682, the \"First Step Act\" in the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington, Wednesday, Nov. 14, 2018, which would reform America's prison system. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced his support for the first major rewrite of the nation\u2019s criminal justice sentencing laws in a generation, but it remains to be seen whether the proposal can pass Congress.\n\nTrump said the bill \u201cwill make our communities safer and give former inmates a second chance at life after they have served their time.\u201d Trump hailed the deal as proof that \u201ctrue bipartisanship is possible\u201d \u2014 though no Democrats attended the White House announcement.\n\nSenators reached an agreement this week on bipartisan legislation that would boost rehabilitation efforts for federal prisoners and give judges more discretion when sentencing nonviolent offenders, particularly for drug offenses. The House approved a prison reform bill in May, but the proposed Senate package makes additional changes and adds the sentencing component. That means the House would need to revote on anything the Senate passes.\n\nCriminal justice reform has been a priority of Trump\u2019s son-in-law, White House senior adviser Jared Kushner, who has been working on the issue for months. Trump pushed for swift passage of the legislation, potentially during the lame-duck session of Congress.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be waiting with a pen,\u201d he said.\n\nPresident Donald Trump hailed the first major rewrite of the nation's criminal justice sentencing laws in a generation. Lawmakers reached agreement this week on the bipartisan First Step Act, but it still needs to be voted on by Congress. (Nov. 14)\n\nBut members still haven\u2019t seen the details, and time is running short.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. was cautious about the bill\u2019s prospects Wednesday. He told reporters that GOP leaders would do a whip count to gauge the bill\u2019s support once they have a final proposal in hand.\n\nStill, he noted the Senate has other things it needs to accomplish in the final weeks of the year, including funding the government and passing a farm bill. He said Republicans would have to see how the criminal justice bill \u201cstacks up against our other priorities\u201d once a final agreement is reached.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., called Trump\u2019s announcement \u201can encouraging sign that we can achieve substantive reforms to our criminal justice system in this Congress.\u201d\n\n\u201cRedemption is at the heart of the American Idea, and that\u2019s what this is about,\u201d he said.\n\nA White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss internal thinking, said they hoped McConnell would hold a whip count after the Thanksgiving break. They also argued Trump\u2019s support would move lawmakers to back the compromise and that more would sign on once legislative text is released.\n\nThe bill is a rare bipartisan endeavor in a typically log-jammed Congress and has attracted support from a coalition of liberal and conservative groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union and groups backed by the political donors Charles and David Koch. Critics say current sentencing guidelines are unfair and have had a lopsided impact on minority communities.\n\n\u201cDid I hear the word bipartisan?\u201d Trump joked during a Roosevelt Room event announcing his backing for the deal. \u201cDid I hear that word? That\u2019s a nice word.\u201d\n\nBut even as he hailed the cooperation, Trump couldn\u2019t resist a swipe at his former political opponents, saying the \u201cClinton crime law\u201d disproportionality affected black Americans.\n\nThe Senate package overhauls some of the mandatory sentencing guidelines that have been in place since 1994 legislation approved by Congress and signed into law by then-President Bill Clinton.\n\nDemocrat Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois and Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa released a joint statement, calling the endorsement \u201can important step in our shared effort to promote safe communities and improve justice.\u201d\n\nGrassley had said Tuesday the bill would be easier to pass after the departure of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who was ousted by Trump last week. Sessions was a longtime opponent of criminal justice reform and had been especially wary of efforts to overhaul sentencing laws.\n\n\u201cI think we have a commitment from the Justice Department now to work with us on it,\u201d Grassley said.\n\nThe White House official called the timing coincidental.\n\nThe Senate approach would allow thousands of federal prisoners sentenced for crack cocaine offenses before August 2010 the opportunity to petition for a reduced penalty. It would also lower mandatory minimum sentences for some drug offenses. The life sentence for some drug offenders with three convictions, or \u201cthree strikes,\u201d would be reduced to 25 years.\n\nBut roughly 90 percent of prison inmates are held in state facilities and would not be affected by the legislation.\n\nAll but two Republicans voted for the House bill when it was overwhelmingly approved in May, 360-59. Democratic lawmakers supported the bill by about a 2-to-1 margin, but opponents voiced concerns that it did not go far enough in giving judges more discretion to make the punishment fit the crime.\n\nThe House bill directs the Bureau of Prisons to conduct assessments for every offender once he or she is sentenced and to offer rehabilitation plans designed to lower the chance of recidivism. The plans would include vocational training, education, counseling and substance abuse treatment.\n\nThe federal inmate population has been on the decline since 2013, when it peaked at just more than 219,000. The total now stands at about 181,400, according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Still, that\u2019s about triple the number of inmates in federal detention 30 years ago.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Deb Riechmann contributed to this report.", "CLEVELAND (AP) \u2014 A man accused of scouting locations in Cleveland to attack people watching Fourth of July fireworks and who talked about carrying out additional bombings has been found competent to stand trial.\n\nA U.S. magistrate adopted the conclusion of a psychologist who evaluated 48-year-old Demetrius Pitts and found Pitts competent to understand court proceedings and assist in his defense.

(AP Photo/Ron Schwane, File)\n\nBEREA, Ohio (AP) \u2014 As John Dorsey prepares to make a critical decision he knows may shape Cleveland\u2019s football fortunes, the Browns general manager spends a moment every day giving himself a pep talk.\n\nAnd a stern warning.\n\n\u201cJust make sure you don\u2019t mess it up, that\u2019s what I tell myself,\u201d Dorsey said. \u201cJust don\u2019t mess this thing up.\u201d\n\nDorsey is in the early stages of heading his first coaching search with the Browns, who have been in a futile pursuit of a competent leader for nearly as long as they\u2019ve been looking for a quarterback.\n\nWith the Browns (3-6-1) on their bye this week, Dorsey provided some insight into a quest that will accelerate once the season is completed and conclude with Cleveland\u2019s ninth coach since 1999.\n\nAs expected, Dorsey said interim coach Gregg Williams will be one of the candidates interviewed. Dorsey has been impressed with the job that Williams, the team\u2019s fiery defensive coordinator, has done over the past two weeks since taking over for Hue Jackson, who was fired on Oct. 29 after going just 3-36-1 in two-plus seasons.\n\nThe Browns beat Atlanta 28-16 on Sunday and have split their two games under the 60-year-old Williams, who Dorsey feels he has provided more than stability.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been a believer of you play the game like you practice and I think these practices have been very competitive,\u201d Dorsey said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been very structured, they\u2019ve been very disciplined, and guys have had some energy and that\u2019s the difference I see. There\u2019s been a focus on the little things which I think is important.\u201d\n\nWilliams has previous head coaching experience with Buffalo from 2001-2003. He was also the defensive coordinator in New Orleans from 2009-2011, when he guided a group that won the Super Bowl but was also embroiled in the \u201cBountygate\u201d scandal that resulted in him being suspended by the NFL for one season.\n\nBesides Williams, Dorsey has been pleased with how Cleveland\u2019s offense has played under running backs coach Freddie Kitchens, who took over play-calling duties when coordinator Todd Haley was fired the same day as Jackson. Dorsey would not speculate on Kitchens\u2019 future with the team, but said he \u201chas done a heck of a job.\u201d\n\nDorsey would not divulge who else in upper Cleveland\u2019s management team will help him find a coach, but he was adamant the Browns will not hire an outside firm to assist, which is something owners Dee and Jimmy Haslam have done in the past.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need that,\u201d he snapped.\n\nDorsey was tight-lipped on other aspects of the search, including whether he would be willing to hire a college coach with no pro experience. However, he did outline the traits he\u2019s seeking in a new coach.\n\n\u201cFor me personally, I would like to see a man of character,\u201d he said. \u201cI would like to see a man who can lead young men. I would like a man who has high football acumen. Those are the three basic things there I\u2019m looking for.\u201d\n\nDorsey promised to be as publicly quiet about the search as he was earlier this year when he kept Cleveland\u2019s No. 1 draft pick a well-guarded secret before choosing quarterback Baker Mayfield.\n\nThat selection is part of why Dorsey feels Cleveland\u2019s coaching gig is so appealing. Mayfield is showing signs of growth and along with rookie running back Nick Chubb, defensive end Myles Garrett, wide receiver Jarvis Landry and others, the Browns have a talented core of young players. The Browns also have nearly $60 million in salary cap space, a rabid fan base, 11 draft picks in 2019 and committed owners fixated on winning.\n\n\u201cThose are exciting things for this organization moving forward,\u201d he said. \u201cAnybody, once they understand that, you will see that, you know what? Cleveland is a good place to be.\u201d\n\nNOTES: Dorsey had little to say about Jackson returning to Cincinnati as a special assistant to Bengals coach Marvin Lewis. \u201cI wish him the best,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was hard a couple of weeks ago.\u201d ... Dorsey would not say if he intends to interview former Arizona coach Bruce Arians, who is retired and doing TV analysis but has expressed interest in Cleveland\u2019s opening. \u201cI have a lot of respect for coach Arians,\u201d Dorsey said. \u201cRight now, we are in the process of beginning to finalize our plan.

(AP Photo/Eric Risberg)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The alcohol will flow less freely, and sometimes not at all, at some small business parties this holiday season.\n\nOwners concerned about sexual misconduct and the safety of staffers and guests are eliminating or limiting the open bar, making their events alcohol-free or switching from a traditional cocktail party to activities including games and contests. Human resources consultants and employment law attorneys say they\u2019re fielding more questions about alcohol and parties than in the past following the string of high-profile sexual misconduct cases that began a year ago. They\u2019re advising their small business clients to impose limits on how much people drink.\n\nLadan Davia decided there\u2019d be no drinking at her company\u2019s party this year after two incidents at last year\u2019s gathering \u2014 a male staffer and then a female staffer who were drunk groped other co-workers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m creating a safer environment for everyone,\u201d says Davia, owner of Beeya, a job search website based in Irvine, California. \u201cWhile I know it can be seen as \u2018not fair\u2019 for banning alcohol from our holiday party, I would respond saying it\u2019s \u2018not fair\u2019 for anyone to feel uncomfortable especially in their place of work.\u201d\n\nDavia understands that alcohol becomes a form of entertainment at an office party, so she\u2019s going to have substitutes for her 11 staffers and their guests: a magician, games and prizes.\n\nHR consultant Rob Wilson has gotten many more calls than in the past from companies needing help with party policies. Even owners who haven\u2019t had problems are asking about going alcohol-free or limiting everyone\u2019s intake. Some owners ask whether they should have chaperones to ensure no one is overdrinking or trying to grope anyone.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re much more cautious than I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d says Wilson, president of Chicago-based Employco.\n\nOwners\u2019 questions come from their concerns about staffers\u2019 well-being and the fact they\u2019re legally liable if drunken employees or guests are in accidents of any kind, hurting themselves or others. The company is also liable if a staffer sexually harasses or verbally or physically abuses anyone.\n\nThere are ways to prevent problems, starting with banning or limiting alcohol. One way to put the brakes on drinking is to give staffers coupons or tickets for drinks. Another option is to serve only wine and beer.\n\nSome of Jay Starkman\u2019s small business clients struggle with the idea of not serving alcohol. They\u2019re concerned about sending a negative message to staffers.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re saying, \u2019I don\u2019t want to not trust my people, or insinuate that they\u2019re a problem,\u201d says Starkman, CEO of Engage PEO, an HR provider based in Hollywood, Florida. Using drink coupons is a way around that concern, Starkman says.\n\nJulia Kravets used to have an open bar at the parties at her Brooklyn, New York, restaurant, Little Choc Apothecary, but some employees drank so much they became sick and Kravets had to help them into cabs. Last year, Kravets brought in games \u201cas opposed to just standing there and alcohol is the only activity.\u201d\n\nShe did serve wine, but no one drank to the point of vomiting and \u201cI didn\u2019t have to revive anybody,\u201d Kravets says.\n\nWhen small business clients ask employment law attorney Mark Kluger what they should do, he tells them, no alcohol, period. But Kluger says that has been the most ignored advice given by the lawyers at his New Jersey-based firm, Kluger Healey, even though when alcohol is served, \u201cthings can get out of hand and often do.\u201d\n\nThis year, clients\u2019 concerns about alcohol are ramped up because of the potential for sexual misconduct. Kluger suggests they follow his firm\u2019s example \u2014 it\u2019s not serving alcohol and is having its party at a hatchet-throwing venue. Kluger believes his staffers and guests won\u2019t miss drinking because they\u2019ll be having fun throwing hatchets at wooden targets, much like the events in lumberjack competitions.\n\n\u201cWe need to walk the walk,\u201d Kluger says. \u201cLast year, we went bowling and we kept so busy, people weren\u2019t thinking, \u2018hey, we\u2019re not drinking.\u2019\u201d\n\nJonathan Bell, also an employment lawyer, is serving alcohol at his firm\u2019s party at a restaurant. But, he says, \u201cwe are sending an email before the holiday party about being responsible both for purposes of safety and for sexual harassment.\u201d He\u2019s also not allowing alcohol in the last hour of the celebration, and if his 11 staffers and/or their guests are drinking too much, he\u2019ll ask the restaurant to stop serving altogether.\n\nBell, founder of the Bell Law Group in Garden City, New York, is putting his staff on notice that they face discipline if they drink too much and behave badly. He notes that under the law, misconduct at a company-sponsored event is the equivalent of misconduct at work. He suggests all employers issue similar warnings \u2014 giving employees a reality check can help them stay in line.\n\n\u201cThat seems to bring the focus to everyone that while they\u2019re hanging out and having a good time socially, they need to be responsible,\u201d he says.\n\n_____\n\nFor more small business news, insights and inspiration, sign up for our free weekly newsletter here: http://discover.ap.org/ssb\n\n_____\n\nFollow Joyce Rosenberg at www.twitter.com/JoyceMRosenberg .

Migrants in a caravan of Central Americans scrambled to reach the U.S. border, catching rides on buses and trucks for hundreds of miles in the last leg of their journey Wednesday as the first sizable groups began arriving in the border city of Tijuana. (AP Photo/Gregory Bull)\n\nTIJUANA, Mexico (AP) \u2014 Migrants in a caravan of Central Americans arrived in Tijuana by the hundreds Wednesday, getting their first glimpse of the robust U.S. military presence that awaits them after President Donald Trump ordered thousands of troops to the border.\n\nSeveral hundred people from the caravan got off buses and made their way to a shelter on the Mexican side near the border to line up for food. Doctors checked those fighting colds and other ailments while several dozen migrants, mostly single men, spent the night at a Tijuana beach that is cut by a towering border wall of metal bars. Several Border Patrol agents in San Diego watched them through the barrier separating the U.S. and Mexico.\n\nThe first wave of migrants in the caravan, which became a central theme of the recent U.S. election, began arriving in Tijuana in recent days, and their numbers have grown each day. The bulk of the main caravan appeared to be about 1,100 miles (1,800 kilometers) from the border, but has recently been moving hundreds of miles a day by hitching rides on trucks and buses.\n\nMany of the new arrivals were waiting in Tijuana for the caravan leaders to arrive and provide guidance on their immigration options to the U.S., including seeking asylum. Some said they might cross illegally.\n\nMexican authorities said 398 Central American migrants travelling in caravan, arrived in the border city of Tijuana on Wednesday. (Nov. 14)\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, meanwhile, visited U.S. troops posted at the border in Texas and said the deployment provides good training for war, despite criticism that the effort is a waste of taxpayer money and a political stunt. Most of the troops are in Texas, more than 1,500 miles from where the caravan is arriving.\n\nThe first arrivals generally received a warm welcome from Tijuana, despite the fact that its shelter system to house migrants is at capacity. The city\u2019s secretary of economic development has said there are about 3,000 jobs for migrants who want to stay in the city. Some residents came down to where the men were camped on a beach and gave them tacos to eat Wednesday.\n\nThe Central Americans in the caravan are the latest migrants to arrive in Tijuana with the hope of crossing into the United States. Tijuana shelters in 2016 housed Haitians who came by the thousands after making their way from Brazil with plans to get to the U.S. Since then, several thousand Haitians have remained in Tijuana, finding work. Some have married local residents and enrolled in local universities.\n\n\u201cMexico has been excellent; we have no complaint about Mexico. The United States remains to be seen,\u201d said Josue Vargas, a migrant from Honduras who finally pulled into Tijuana on Wednesday after more than a month on the road.\n\nIlse Marilu, 24, arrived in Tijuana late Tuesday with her 3-year-old daughter, having joined the caravan with a large contingent from San Pedro Sula, Honduras. She walked several miles Tuesday in a fruitless search for space in a migrant shelter before reaching the beach plaza. A Mexican couple dropped off a tent that her daughter and three other children used to sleep in as an evening chill set in.\n\nShe planned to stay in Tijuana until caravan leaders arrived and offered help on how to seek asylum in the US.\n\n\u201cWe are going to enter through the front door,\u201d Marilu said, insisting she would never try to enter the country illegally.\n\nA few people pitched tents at the Tijuana beach plaza while most, like Henry Salinas, 30, of Honduras, planned to sleep there in the open.\n\nHe said that he intended to wait for thousands more in the caravan to arrive and that he hoped to jump the fence in a large group at the same time, overwhelming Border Patrol agents.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be all against one, one against all. All of Central America against one, and one against Central America. ... All against Trump, and Trump against all,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Tuesday, a couple of dozen migrants scaled the steel border fence to celebrate their arrival, chanting \u201cYes, we could!\u201d One man dropped over to the U.S. side briefly as border agents watched from a distance. He ran quickly back to the fence.\n\nTijuana\u2019s head of migrant services, Cesar Palencia Chavez, said authorities offered to take the migrants to shelters immediately, but they initially refused.\n\n\u201cThey wanted to stay together in a single shelter,\u201d Palencia Chavez said, \u201cbut at this time that\u2019s not possible\u201d because shelters are designed for smaller groups and generally offer separate facilities for men, women and families.\n\nBut he said that after their visit to the border, most were taken to shelters in groups of 30 or 40.\n\nOn Wednesday, buses and trucks carried some migrants into the state of Sinaloa along the Gulf of California and farther northward into the border state of Sonora.\n\nThe Rev. Miguel Angel Soto, director of the Casa de Migrante in the Sinaloa capital of Culiacan, said about 2,000 migrants had arrived in that area. He said the state government, the Roman Catholic Church and city officials in Escuinapa, Sinaloa, were helping the migrants.\n\nThe priest said the church had been able to get \u201cgood people\u201d to provide buses for moving migrants northward. He said 24 buses had left Escuinapa on an eight-hour drive to Navojoa in Sonora state.\n\nSmall groups were also reported in the northern cities of Saltillo and Monterrey, in the region near Texas.\n\nAbout 1,300 migrants in a second caravan were resting at a stadium in Mexico City, where the first group stayed several days last week. By early Wednesday, an additional 1,100 migrants from a third and last caravan also arrived at the stadium.\n\nLike most of those in the third caravan, migrant Javier Pineda is from El Salvador, and hopes to reach the United States. Referring to the first group nearing the end of the journey, Pineda said, \u201cif they could do it, there is no reason why we can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nMexico has offered refuge, asylum and work visas to the migrants, and its government said Monday that 2,697 temporary visas had been issued to individuals and families to cover them during the 45-day application process for more permanent status. Some 533 migrants had requested a voluntary return to their countries, the government reported.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Elliot Spagat reported in Tijuana, Mexico, and AP writer Maria Verza reported from Escuinapa, Mexico.", "FILE - In this May 22, 2018, file photo, former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio speaks during a campaign event in Phoenix.

(AP Photo/Matt York, File)\n\nPHOENIX (AP) \u2014 A judge in Arizona who ordered taxpayer-funded compensation for Latinos who were illegally detained when then-Sheriff Joe Arpaio defied a court order has declined to give the victims more time to apply for the money.\n\nThe two-sentence ruling issued Tuesday by U.S. District Judge Murray Snow in the racial-profiling case means the one-year period for filing claims will end on Dec. 3.\n\nTwo years ago, Snow ordered the creation of a $500,000 compensation fund as a remedy for Arpaio\u2019s acknowledged disobedience of the 2011 order to stop his traffic patrols that targeted immigrants.\n\nAdvocates for immigrant rights had argued that more time was needed to locate the victims.\n\nAttorneys for Maricopa County countered by urging the judge to reject the proposed extension and accused opposing lawyers of trying to rewrite the terms of the compensation plan.\n\nUnder the plan, Maricopa County will pay $500 for the first hour of a person\u2019s illegal detention and $35 for each additional 20-minute increment.\n\nA $10,000 cap was imposed on such compensation, but victims can also seek money for damages such as lost wages and emotional distress.\n\nThe compensation costs are a small piece of the overall cost of the case, which so far have totaled $90 million.\n\nLawyers who filed the profiling lawsuit have said at least 190 people were detained in violation of the 2011 order, but they are unable to find their phone numbers and addresses.\n\nFar fewer people than expected have filed claims because of the difficulty of locating victims.\n\nOnly one claim totaling $1,095 has been paid among the 93 filed. Twelve others are considered payable but await a rebuttal from the sheriff\u2019s office, according to county records.\n\nArpaio called The Associated Press unsolicited Wednesday morning to point out that, after all the litigation over the illegal detentions, only one person has been paid.\n\n\u201cWhy isn\u2019t anybody coming forward? I would like to know the answer to that question. It\u2019s not gloating. I\u2019m not gloating,\u201d said Arpaio, who insisted he wasn\u2019t responsible for causing the fund to be created.\n\nKathy Brody, one of the American Civil Liberties Union attorneys leading the profiling case against the sheriff\u2019s office, said the claims from the 12 people whose claims are considered payable would total about $150,000 if approved.\n\nBrody said she and others involved in the case suspect victims aren\u2019t coming forward because they fear that doing so will lead to their deportation.\n\n\u201cHe (Arpaio) has never shown any respect for the rights of these people and any concerns they have, so I am not surprised that this is his view,\u201d Brody said.\n\nArpaio was accused of prolonging the patrols to boost his 2012 re-election campaign. He was later convicted of criminal contempt of court for violating the court order, though a pardon by President Donald Trump spared Arpaio a possible jail sentence. He lost the 2016 sheriff\u2019s race.\n\nTaxpayers in metro Phoenix remain on the hook for compensation for the illegal detentions made during the patrols between late December 2011 and May 2013.\n\nLawyers involved in the profiling case and a firm running the claims process have worked with community organizations and foreign consulates offices in hopes of finding victims.

(AP Photo/Gareth Patterson, File)\n\nLITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) \u2014 Arkansas\u2019 governor on Wednesday proposed a $5.7 billion budget for the coming year that sets aside money to raise minimum salaries for public school teachers and for his plan to continue cutting state income taxes.\n\nGov. Asa Hutchinson, a Republican who was re-elected last week, proposed increasing state spending in the fiscal year that begins July 1 by more than $129 million, or about 2 percent. The biggest spending increases go toward the state\u2019s Medicaid program and its public schools, and the proposal also calls for hiring more parole officers and state police troopers.\n\n\u201cThere are always other ways to spend money, but this budget meets our state obligations, funds necessary services, increases teacher pay, meets the needs of public safety and continues to reform our tax code,\u201d Hutchinson told a legislative panel.\n\nHutchinson said the budget includes a $111 million plan to cut the state\u2019s top income tax rate, as well as simplify tax tables and brackets. Under Hutchinson\u2019s proposal, the state\u2019s top income tax rate will be cut from 6.9 percent to 6.5 percent in 2020 and to 6.3 percent the following year. The proposal will cost the state $47 million the first year and $111 million when fully implemented. The proposal also calls for raising the standard deduction for taxpayers.\n\nHutchinson also proposed setting aside $60 million to raise the minimum teacher salary in the state from $31,800 to $36,000 over the next four years. Hutchinson said the money will be available to 174 school districts that are paying less than the new proposed minimum salary.\n\nHutchinson\u2019s tax cut plan is likely to face competition in the majority-Republican Legislature from lawmakers who say they\u2019d like other reductions to be considered.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s substantial interest in the governor\u2019s proposal. I\u2019ve also heard from others who have maybe other things they want to look at in addition to that, or other possible alternatives,\u201d House Speaker Matthew Shepherd, a Republican, said.\n\nDemocrats have expressed concern about the impact the tax cuts could have on other state needs. House Minority Leader Charles Blake said Democrats in that chamber will again push for a tax credit aimed at helping low-income residents.\n\nHutchinson said the state\u2019s revenue will take a $38 million hit from a measure voters approved last week legalizing casinos in four counties. The measure allows full casinos at a Hot Springs horse tack and a West Memphis dog track that already offer electronic gambling. The tracks will pay a lower tax rate on the casino gambling proceeds than the electronic gambling under the amendment. Supporters of the amendment have argued the casinos will generate far more income with the additional gambling. Hutchinson said the reduction won\u2019t lead to a cut in any state services, but will mean less money the state could put in reserve funds or other savings.\n\nHutchinson did not outline any plans to call for additional highway funding. The governor on Tuesday said a highway funding plan is a priority for the legislative session that begins January, but stopped short of endorsing any specific proposals yet.\n\n___\n\nFollow Andrew DeMillo on Twitter at www.twitter.com/ademillo", "US energy secretary In Prague to lobby for nuclear industry\n\nPRAGUE (AP) \u2014 U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry has been lobbying in Prague for the U.S. civil nuclear industry as the most suitable to develop the Czech nuclear program.\n\nThe Czech Republic relies on nuclear energy and the current six reactors produce a third of the country\u2019s electricity.\n\nThe country is planning to build new reactors and possibly extend the life of some of the existing ones.\n\nPerry said Wednesday: \u201cI can assure you that the U.S. industry is the safest, most reliable for the job.\u201d\n\nAlthough the Czech government has yet to announce a detailed plan, six major industry players from around the globe, including U.S. Westinghouse and Russia\u2019s Rosatom are interested in getting a lucrative deal.\n\nPerry warned against cooperation with Russia, saying it has used energy \u201cas a political weapon.\u201d", "Florida school shooting suspect Nikolas Cruz appears in court via video with public defender Diane Cuddihy in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Wednesday, Nov. 14, 2018.

(AP) \u2014 Florida school shooting suspect Nikolas Cruz attacked a detention officer at the county jail and now faces new charges including use of the officer\u2019s electric stun device, authorities said Wednesday.\n\nBroward Sheriff\u2019s Office spokeswoman Veda Coleman-Wright said in an email Wednesday that Cruz assaulted Sgt. Raymond Beltran around 6 p.m. Tuesday.\n\nJail records show Cruz now is charged with aggravated assault on an officer, battery on an officer and use of an \u201celectric or chemical weapon against an officer.\u201d\n\nThe 20-year-old Cruz faces the death penalty in the Feb. 14 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland that killed 17 people and wounded 17 others. He\u2019s pleaded not guilty in the shooting, but his lawyers say he would plead guilty in exchange for a life prison sentence.\n\nAccording to the assault arrest report, Cruz attacked Beltran after he was told to \u201cnot drag his sandals around\u201d while walking in a jail dayroom. Cruz responded, the report says, by showing Beltran his middle finger and then rushing the deputy and striking him with his fist.\n\nThe report says Cruz and Beltran then \u201cgot into a physical altercation\u201d in which both wound up on the floor and Cruz was able to wrest control of the stun gun, technically called a \u201cconducive electronic weapon.\u201d The stun gun discharged but it\u2019s not clear from the report whether it struck anyone; Beltran was able to regain control.\n\nBeltran was struck multiple times by Cruz using his fists, according to video surveillance cited by the report.\n\nFinally, the report says Beltran struck Cruz in the face with a fist containing the stun gun and Cruz then \u201cretreated to one of the seats\u201d in the dayroom before he was taken into custody.\n\nThe report doesn\u2019t detail the severity of injuries to Cruz or Beltran.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know any more than you do as of yet,\u201d Broward County Public Defender Howard Finkelstein said in an email.\n\nCruz appeared at a brief initial hearing Wednesday on the assault charges, with bail set at $200,000. But he won\u2019t be released because he is being held without bail on the murder charges.\n\nMeanwhile, the state commission investigating the shooting heavily criticized Wednesday the actions of the sheriff\u2019s deputy assigned to the campus, calling him a coward for not confronting the gunman.\n\nMembers of the Marjory Stoneman High School commission said Broward sheriff\u2019s deputy Scot Peterson was \u201cnot a real cop\u201d and was \u201ca coward\u201d as they reviewed video and photos of his actions during the shooting. They said Peterson did not enter the building to confront the shooter, but stayed outside.\n\nHis attorney didn\u2019t respond to an email Wednesday seeking comment. Peterson is scheduled to testify before the commission Thursday. He has previously said he didn\u2019t know whether the shots were coming from inside or outside the building and that he heard only two or three shots.\n\nThe commission also heard from a Pinellas County detective who investigated Cruz\u2019s internet searches, text messages and cellphone usage.\n\nSgt. John Suess said Cruz\u2019s earliest found internet search referencing school massacres happened three months before the Parkland shooting. On Jan. 21, Cruz wrote himself a cellphone note saying \u201clife is a mess\u201d and \u201cunfair\u201d and he was getting \u201ceven more agitated.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to kill people but I don\u2019t know how to do it,\u201d he wrote.\n\nSuess said Cruz frequently looked up the song \u201cPumped Up Kicks,\u201d where a shooter sings that other kids \u201cbetter run, outrun my gun.\u201d\n\nAbout a week before the shooting, he said, Cruz searched \u201cIs killing people easy.\u201d\n\nOn Feb. 9, five days before the shooting, Cruz did searches seeking information about homicidal thoughts and urges and for a therapist. Some commissioners said they believe Cruz was having second thoughts.\n\nBut the next day, Cruz was again looking at videos about the Columbine and Virginia Tech shootings.\n\nThree days before the shooting, Cruz made previously released cellphone videos that he never shared outlining his plans, the commission was told. He looked up how long it takes police to respond to school shootings.\n\nOn the morning of the shooting, Cruz sent innocuous texts to the friend he was living with about meeting some girls that night or that he might go to a movie.\n\nIt was Valentine\u2019s Day and during the two hours before the shooting, Cruz tried repeatedly to engage his ex-girlfriend in phone and text conversations, but she told him to leave her alone and that she had a boyfriend. He responded, \u201cYou will always know I love you.\u201d\n\nHe soon contacted Uber to take him to the school.\n\n___\n\nFollow Curt Anderson on Twitter: http://twitter.com/Miamicurt", "PHOENIX (AP) \u2014 Sunday, Nov. 18\n\nOn this date in 1873, the military telegraph was completed between San Diego and Prescott.\n\nOn this date in 1900, the two Haldeman brothers were legally hanged in Tombstone for killing two police officers.\n\nOn this date in 1914, a feature story in the Tucson Citizen told how ostrich farms in Phoenix and Yuma were facing ruin as plumes on women\u2019s hats went out of style.\n\nOn this date in 1930, The Arizona Republic announced the purchase of The Phoenix Gazette.\n\nOn this date in 1931, the Steward Observatory at the University of Arizona recorded a spectacular display of 278 meteors from midnight to 5 a.m.\n\nMonday, Nov. 19\n\nOn this date in 1887, a boiler exploded in a Prescott sawmill, killing six workmen.\n\nOn this date in 1929, by a vote of more than 2 to 1, Cochise County residents elected to move the county seat from Tombstone to Bisbee.\n\nOn this date in 1929, a party of surveyors from the Pima County engineers office left for the Ajo-Sonoyta road project site to begin preliminary surveying.\n\nOn this date in 1961, Joe Clark, rancher, city marshal of Willcox, and grandfather of movie and recording star Rex Allen, died.\n\nOn this date in 1979, a Nevada Airlines plane crashed near the Grand Canyon\u2019s South Rim shortly after takeoff, injuring seven passengers and two crew members.\n\nTuesday, Nov. 20\n\nOn this date in 1899, Pearl Hart, Arizona\u2019s female bandit, was tried at Florence for robbery, convicted and sentenced to five years in prison.\n\nOn this date in 1914, James A.

That estimate was significantly higher than previous studies that focused on primarily on costs associated with prescription opioid misuse and dependence, including health care and lost productivity.\n\nRepublican Gov.

When someone who does not live in fire country sees hell on earth through their television screen, it is a surreal vignette, a movie special effect, but not one that most of us would ever directly experience. But thousands of courageous firefighters and other first responders are staring directly into the inferno in California each day.\n\nMany of these firefighters sleep on the ground because they are too exhausted to make the return trip to their base camp. Then they get up and do it again, day after day. All Californians should be profoundly grateful to them.\n\nForty-four people have lost their lives in the Camp Fire, making it the worst fire in the state\u2019s history. Rescuers fear the number will be much higher; 200 are still unaccounted for.\n\nClose to 9,000 firefighters are on the ground battling the Butte County Camp Fire and the Woolsey Fire centered in Malibu. That figure doesn\u2019t include police, sheriffs, hospital personnel, EMTs, coroners, and volunteers helping to feed and support them. They\u2019re not just from California, either. Firefighters from Oregon, Idaho, New Mexico, Texas, Utah, Washington, and Montana are pitching in, too. No red states, no blue states: states, united.\n\nTragically, ninety firefighters and first responders have lost their homes in the Camp Fire as they struggled to contain the flames. In Butte County, 30 sheriffs alone are now homeless due to the conflagration. Butte College Police Chief Casey Carlson lost his house, along with the houses of several of his officers.\n\n\u201cWhen we got the evacuation order, I went up to grab a few things, and houses (on the block) were on fire when I was leaving,\u201d Carlson said. \u201cYou kind of have to accept it.

It was, after all, only a year ago that the Thomas Fire and Las Vegas massacre profoundly scarred Ventura County.\n\nOur community is hurting right now. Yet as individuals, we are not helpless. We can leave cynicism, fatalism and paralysis behind and take personal responsibility for doing what we can to support the victims while preparing ourselves for emergencies. The hurt cannot be undone, but we can strive to lessen the damage if and when tragedy strikes again.\n\nLives were saved at the Borderline when people took cover or fled. Many schools, large companies and other institutions practice these techniques in active-shooter training, but how many of us have taken the initiative to do it on our own?\n\nExperts say it\u2019s a natural reaction to freeze when you hear a gunshot, and that makes you vulnerable. Preparing yourself mentally on how to immediately react can save your life, they say, especially considering that most active-shooter incidents are over within 3 minutes.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security has posted a shooting training video, \u201cOptions for Consideration,\u201d that can benefit us all. The video on when to \u201crun, hide or fight\u201d and other important information is available at dhs.gov/active-shooter-preparedness, and we encourage you to study it.\n\nLives and property also were undoubtedly saved this past week because homeowners were prepared for wildfires. In a county prone to drought, Santa Ana winds and heat waves \u2014 weather patterns expected to worsen because of climate change \u2014 every resident, and especially those in hillside areas, must be prepared for the worst.\n\nThat includes clearing at least 100 feet of brush around structures (required by law), having a cache of emergency supplies (food, water, flashlights, batteries, etc.) in both your home and car, and developing an evacuation plan for all members of your family. A Public Policy Institute of California survey in 2014 found 47 percent of respondents didn\u2019t have a disaster supply kit and 51 percent lacked a disaster plan.\n\nIt also means evacuating sooner rather than later. Before the deadly Montecito mudflows that followed the Thomas Fire, many residents refused to leave. Now, those in the Woolsey and Hill burn areas may face similar choices when winter rains arrive.\n\nAll the information you need is at readyventuracounty. We urge you to educate yourself and get prepared if you\u2019re not already.\n\nPsychologists say helping victims or survivors also can reduce a sense of helplessness and start a healing process. You can donate blood (blood4life.org), or give money to Ventura County Community Foundation funds earmarked for the Borderline and fire victims (vccf.org). The Rotary Club of Westlake Village also is raising money for the shooting victims (gofundme.com/borderline-shooting-victim039s-fund).\n\nFinally, it can help to just share your feelings with family, friends and neighbors. \u201cDon\u2019t get trapped in isolation,\u201d Shawn Thornton, a pastor at Calvary Community Church in Westlake Village, told The Star. \u201cThis feeling is very real, but it won\u2019t always be here.\u201d\n\n___\n\nNov. 9\n\nThe San Diego Union-Tribune on California Supreme Court case possibly easing cities\u2019 pension crisis:\n\nIt is a basic precept of democracy that laws are crafted by legislative bodies, subject to vetoes by mayors, governors or presidents, and that laws cannot be imposed on citizens without going through this process. So how is it possible that governments in California are tied in knots by a legal theory that\u2019s treated as law even though it was never passed by the Legislature and signed by the governor?\n\nThat should be the central question considered by the California Supreme Court on Dec. 5 when it takes up challenges to the state\u2019s 2012 pension reform law, including its ban on the outrageous practice of allowing public employees to spike their pensions by buying years of service. The fire union local that sued over this provision argued that it violated the \u201cCalifornia rule\u201d \u2014 a legal theory arising out of a 1955 state Supreme Court ruling that holds that the pensions in place on the day a public employee is hired can never be reduced even for years not yet worked. Various legal analyses have shown this ruling cannot be based on any claim that it reflected the intent of the state Legislature.\n\nIf the \u201cCalifornia rule\u201d is scrapped, as some lower courts have advocated, that wouldn\u2019t just be a triumph for democracy. It would give local governments \u2014 which face what the League of California Cities called \u201cunsustainable\u201d pension burdens that will soon eat up 21.5 percent or more of annual budgets in one out of 10 cities \u2014 a tool to address pension costs immediately. To those who say public employee pension benefits should be immutable, here\u2019s a request: Cite the state law backing that up.", "GREAT FALLS, Mont.

(Avontea Boose via AP)\n\nCHICAGO (AP) \u2014 A security guard who was working at a suburban Chicago bar when a black co-worker was fatally shot by a white police officer said Wednesday that he never heard the officer order the other man to drop his gun.\n\nThe comments from Dorian Myrickes came hours after Illinois State Police released a statement saying witnesses have told investigators that the officer ordered security guard Jemel Roberson to drop his gun before opening fire. Police were responding to a gunfight early Sunday at Manny\u2019s Blue Room in Robbins that injured four people, including Myrickes.\n\nMyrickes, who was shot in the shoulder, told The Associated Press in a phone interview from his hospital room that he clearly heard several people shout at the officer that Roberson \u2014 who was holding a suspect at gunpoint \u2014 was a security guard.\n\nIt was not the only aspect where Myrickes\u2019 account differed from that of the news release that Illinois State Police issued Tuesday night that for the first time addressed in detail what happened in the predominantly black community of Robbins just south of Chicago. The agency declined to comment beyond the release, which came as questions have swirled about whether the shooting was justified and whether race played a role.\n\nIn its release, state police said Roberson was wearing \u201cplain black clothing with no markings readily identifying him as a Security Guard.\u201d However, Myrickes said all the security guards wore knit hats emblazoned with the word \u201cSecurity\u201d on them and that Roberson wore a black sweat shirt with the word \u201cSecurity\u201d on the back of shoulder. But he also acknowledged that it\u2019s possible the officer could not see the white lettering from where he was standing.\n\nMyrickes was one of six security guards working at the bar at the time, but he is the only one so far to come forward publicly to discuss what happened. A bar patron also told reporters earlier that he heard people yelling at the officer that Roberson was a security guard.\n\nMyrickes, 43, said the initial shooting at the bar stemmed from a fight between two groups of people. As security guards tried to separate them and lead them out separate doors, \u201cSomebody came back and opened fire,\u201d Myrickes said.\n\nHe said he wasn\u2019t armed and that he doesn\u2019t believe other security guards fired their weapons.\n\nThe officer who shot Roberson was from the nearby community of Midlothian and was among several officers from various agencies who responded to the shooting. Myrickes told the AP that the officer ran into the bar and pointed his gun at a bar customer, the bartender and Myrickes. Myrickes said he informed the officer that he was a security guard, and the officer then went outside.\n\nLooking out the door, Myrickes said he \u201ccould see Jemel had one guy face down, asking him to put his hands behind his back\u201d when he saw the officer point his weapon at Roberson.\n\n\u201cI never heard the cop demand him to do anything, (but) everybody was telling him (Jemel) was security.\u201d\n\nMyrickes also noted that none of the other responding officers opened fire.\n\nThe officer\u2019s name has not been released. He is on paid leave.\n\nVideo of the shooting could reveal exactly what happened, but the agencies involved have not said whether any exists. If any police bodycam video exists, no state law requires that it be released. The Chicago Police Department releases video within 90 days of a shooting, but that policy does not apply because that agency\u2019s officers were not involved.\n\nKulis, who has filed a motion asking a judge to order the agencies to preserve any footage they have, also said he doesn\u2019t yet know how many times Roberson was shot or where on his body he was shot.\n\n\u201cI talked to the family after they viewed his body and they said they (authorities) did not tell them how many times he\u2019d been shot,\u201d he said.", "FILE - In this Friday, Oct. 19, 2018 file photo, Nikola Gruevski, former country's Prime Minister and now a lawmaker of the opposition VMRO-DPMNE, looks on in Macedonian Parliament in the capital Skopje.

(AP) \u2014 An Alabama community is coping after five of its high school football players were injured when a block wall collapsed in a locker room before a game.\n\n\u201cInitially, they were in shock,\u201d Oakman High School Principal Patrick Gann said of the student body. \u201cThey were really upset and worried. Some of them were even in tears that happened to their friends, and seeing them hauled off in an ambulance, on stretchers, was eerie.\u201d\n\nOakman football players traveled over three hours to Pike County High School last Friday to face the Bulldogs in the first round of the 3A playoffs. Shortly before the game, a concrete retaining wall in the visitor\u2019s locker room at Pike County High collapsed on five Oakman players.\n\nAll five were taken to hospitals, and three suffered back injuries. Around midday Tuesday, Oakman coach Mark Hastings said one student remained in the hospital, while another was released Sunday in a back brace. Another student was visiting an orthopedic physician for back and shoulder injuries.\n\nHe said two other players were released from the hospital the night of the incident after suffering head lacerations. Those two students are expected to have no lasting impacts from their injuries, but the healing process of the other three players remains uncertain.\n\nThree of the injured players were starters, which Hastings said put the team at a disadvantage when they played Pike County in the rescheduled game Monday. The Wildcats lost 21-8, but Hastings commended the team for their valiant effort.\n\n\u201cThey definitely hurt for their teammates. A lot of them are really close, so obviously that was tough on them,\u201d Hastings said. \u201cThey also knew they had 40 other teammates that needed them, and they needed to give it their best effort \u2014 both mentally and physically \u2014 and that\u2019s what they did.\u201d\n\nOakman Mayor Cory Franks said his nephew was one of the players injured Friday. His nephew has been released from Children\u2019s of Alabama and will be wearing a back brace for a while due to injured vertebrae. He will not be able to play sports for the remainder of the school year and possibly next year, according to Franks.\n\nHe said his nephew was still trying to process what happened when he visited him at Children\u2019s Friday night.\n\n\u201cHe was in shock. He couldn\u2019t walk, and he wasn\u2019t saying much. He was in a lot of pain,\u201d Franks said. \u201cHe was really just shaken up by the whole incident. ... It was a traumatic situation for the kids.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cBeing such a small town, anything that happens on that level affects everybody, and we\u2019re all concerned for the well-being of our children athletes. I know that the school is going to handle it and make sure they get the answers they need.\u201d\n\nGann said the superintendent of Pike County Schools, along with the high school\u2019s principal, have remained supportive. He also spoke to the state fire marshal investigating the incident. What caused the wall in the locker room to fall remains uncertain.\n\nWalker County\u2019s interim school superintendent, Joel Hagood, called the incident \u201cbizarre.\u201d\n\n\u201cNone of the boys were acting out of the ordinary. They weren\u2019t rough housing or playing around \u2014 pushing on the wall, in other words, for it to collapse. It sounds like the wall just fell,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Daily Mountain Eagle, http://www.mountaineagle.com", "In this courtroom sketch Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, center, sits next to his defense attorney Eduardo Balazero, left, for opening statements as Guzman's high-security trial gets underway in the Brooklyn borough of New York, Tuesday, Nov. 13, 2018. Guzman pleaded not guilty to charges that he amassed a multi-billion-dollar fortune smuggling tons of cocaine and other drugs in a vast supply chain that reached New York, New Jersey, Texas and elsewhere north of the border. The infamous Mexican drug lord has been held in solitary confinement since his extradition to the United States early last year. (Elizabeth Williams via AP)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 An admitted former Mexican cartel member first met the notorious drug lord Joaquin \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzman when he helped him evade a manhunt, he said in court testimony Wednesday.\n\nTaking the witness stand for the government at Guzman\u2019s U.S. trial, Jesus Zambada identified Guzman in the courtroom and told jurors he \u201cwas one of the most powerful drug-traffickers in Mexico,\u201d detailing how the Sianola cartel made massive profits by smuggling ton-upon-ton of cocaine into the United States.\n\nZambada \u2014 a 57-year-old trained accountant who was arrested in 2008 and is still in U.S. custody \u2014 was the first of several cooperators expected to give jurors an inside look at a cartel with a legendary lust for drugs, cash and violence.\n\nAppearing in a blue jail uniform and wearing tinted glasses, Zambada testified when special military forces were trying to hunt down Guzman in 2001 after a prison break, he was tasked with trying to find a spot where the cartel could land a helicopter for its boss.\n\n\u201cWe were rescuing him ... because the military was about to recapture him,\u201d the witness said through a Spanish interpreter.\n\nProsecutors have started presenting evidence to jurors in the trial of the notorious drug smuggler known as El Chapo by giving them a video tour of a tunnel between Mexico and an Arizona warehouse. (Nov. 14)\n\nZambada said for most of the 2000s, his brother, Ismael \u201cEl Mayo\u201d Zambada, and Guzman were considered the top leaders of the Sianola cartel as it imported large shipments of Colombian cocaine by land, sea and air to Mexico before using various means to get it to the U.S. market. A popular smuggling method involved stashing the drugs in containers hidden inside gas tanker trucks filled with fuel, he said.\n\nAs the cocaine was moved north, its profit potential skyrocketed, he said. A kilo purchased in Colombia for $3,000 would fetch $20,000 in Los Angeles, $25,000 in Chicago and $35,000 in New York City, he said.\n\nZambada testified he ran a cartel warehouse in Mexico City that processed 80 to 100 tons of cocaine a year, a volume that that brought in \u201cbillions\u201d in revenue. Through bribes, he claimed, \u201cI controlled the airport in Mexico City. ... Controlled the authority.\u201d\n\nThe testimony, which was to continue Thursday, came on the second day of the trial in Brooklyn federal court, where Guzman pleaded not guilty to drug-trafficking charges after being extradicted to the U.S. last year.\n\nThe defense has described the cooperating witnesses like Zambada as liars seeking to reduce their own sentences.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re here because they want to get out of jail by any means necessary,\u201d a member of Guzman\u2019s defense team, Jeffrey Lichtman, said Wednesday in a continuation of an opening statement that began Tuesday.\n\nDespite his diminutive stature and nickname that means \u201cShorty\u201d in Spanish, Guzman was once a larger-than-life kingpin both feared and admired in Mexico. The defense has sought to counter that reputation by portraying him as lesser figure in a drug gang it says was actually under the control of Ismael Zambada, who\u2019s still at large.\n\nBefore Wednesday\u2019s testimony, U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan admonished Lichtman for using his opening statement to claim, without proof or any relevance, Ismael Zambada remains free because he bribed the current and former presidents of Mexico. Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto and former President Felipe Calderon both dismissed the allegations as completely false.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, federal prosecutors gave jurors a video tour of a tunnel between Mexico and an Arizona warehouse \u2014 a corridor Guzman allegedly used to speed drug deliveries to America. The warehouse was just two blocks from a U.S. Customs office in the border city of Douglas.\n\nRetired U.S. Customs Agent Carlos Salazar, the trial\u2019s first witness, told jurors agents were surprised at how sophisticated the tunnel was, saying it contained equipment that might be found in a car repair shop.\n\nThe tunnel was half the length of a football field and large enough that a 5-foot-8-inch man barely had to lower his head to walk through it. It was equipped with electric lights, an industrial-sized weigh scale and a hydraulic system to lift away flooring that was covered by a pool table.\n\nAuthorities used heavy tools to smash through concrete, Salazar said, only to realize later it all would have opened up on the Mexican side with the twist of a water faucet valve.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t know the floor came up,\u201d he said.", "Walker says he\u2019s not speaking out of \u2018decency\u2019\n\nMADISON, Wis.

It takes effect in January.\n\nBut they pleaded anew for help from Congress to relieve the Postal Service of onerous health and pension prepayments and for help from regulators to grant the agency more flexibility to increase prices so it can return to profitability.\n\n\u201cAbsent legislative and regulatory change, we cannot generate enough revenue or cut enough costs to pay off our bills,\u201d said Postmaster General and CEO Megan J. Brennan. \u201cThe flawed business model imposed by law continues to be the root cause of our financial instability.\u201d\n\nThe Postal Service reported a loss of $3.9 billion for the budget year that ended Sept. 30, compared with a $2.7 billion loss the year before.\n\nA nearly 7 percent increase in package delivery was unable to offset drop-offs in letter mail, which makes up more than 70 percent of total revenue. First-class mail volume fell by roughly 2.1 billion pieces, or 3.6 percent, as people in the digital age rely more on email for online bill payments.\n\nRevenue was $70.7 billion, compared with $69.6 billion last year, but there were higher transportation and labor costs from delivering more packages.\n\nTrump in recent months has asserted without evidence that the Postal Service is \u201closing a fortune\u201d and reporting annual losses because it is not charging higher shipping rates for online retailers such as Amazon, whose founder, Jeff Bezos, owns The Washington Post. In April, Trump issued an executive order demanding a review of the Postal Service\u2019s finances. That report, led by the Treasury Department and originally due in August, was expected to be released in the coming weeks.\n\nTrump has often labeled the Post \u201cfake news\u201d after the newspaper reported unfavorable developments during his campaign and presidency and highlighted the Bezos connection by calling it the \u201cAmazon Washington Post.\u201d On Sunday, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., the expected next chairman of the House intelligence committee, told Axios that Democrats will seek to investigate whether Trump sought to punish Bezos by pressuring the Postal Service to raise Amazon\u2019s rates.\n\nPackage delivery has been a bright spot although its growth is slowing, and regulators have found its contract with Amazon to be profitable.\n\nThe Postal Service, an independent agency, is trying to stay financially afloat as it seeks to invest billions in new delivery trucks to get packages more nimbly to American homes.\n\nRegulators this week approved the Postal Service\u2019s request to increase the price of its first-class stamp by 5 cents. The 10 percent increase to the cost of mailing a 1-ounce letter is the biggest since 1991. The price of each additional ounce will drop from 21 cents to 15 cents. The rate increase takes effect on Jan. 27.\n\nTo become financially stable, the Postal Service has been urging Congress to provide it relief from the mandate to prefund retiree health benefits. Legislation in 2006 required the Postal Service to fund 75 years\u2019 worth of retiree health benefits, something that neither the government nor private companies are required to do. It is also seeking flexibility from regulators to increase stamp rates above the rate of inflation.\n\nTo avert bankruptcy, the post office has defaulted on the multibillion-dollar health prepayments each year since 2012.\n\n___\n\nFollow Yen on Twitter at https://twitter.com/hopeyen1", "New Hampshire getting $136K to help tidal crossing projects\n\nCONCORD, N.H.

Champ won the tournament and goes into the final PGA Tour event of the year as one of the top attractions at Sea Island. (AP Photo/Rogelio V. Solis, File)\n\nST. SIMONS ISLAND, Ga. (AP) \u2014 Cameron Champ was a freshman in high school and a graduate of The First Tee program, missing only the means to travel the country to play junior golf tournaments with hopes of getting noticed outside Northern California.\n\nOne phone call made a difference as big as some of his drives.\n\nHis father called John Wood, an old friend from high school in Sacramento who at the time was caddying for Hunter Mahan.\n\n\u201cHe said his son was into golf and would I come out and spend a day with him,\u201d Wood said Wednesday morning from the Australian Open, where he now works for Matt Kuchar. \u201cYou get those calls and figure you\u2019ll go watch a guy shoot 80. But I literally watched Cam hit three shots and thought: \u2018Hang on. Something is very, very, very different here.\u2019 You could see the physical talent, and he\u2019s such a polite kid, the kind you\u2019d want to help. His potential was off the charts.\u201d\n\nChamp is a top attraction this week in the RSM Classic at Sea Island, mainly because of how far he hits the ball, partly because of the attention he gets from how far he hits the ball. He began his rookie season six weeks ago and won the Sanderson Farms Championship in his second start as a PGA Tour member. His clubhead speed has been clocked at just under 130 mph, faster than anyone on tour. His ball speed has been measured at just over 192 mph coming off the club, another head-turner.\n\nHe still views that phone call as a pivotal moment.\n\nWood made a pitch to Mahan, who invited Champ to his American Junior Golf Association event in Texas. Champ took it from there.\n\n\u201cI still look back on that as if I didn\u2019t get that, who knows what would happen?\u201d Champ said. \u201cFor my family, there was no way for us to be able to travel and play so many of those events to get rankings up.\u201d\n\nWood said he first called friends at Ping Golf, a big supporter of junior golf, which helped Champ with equipment. Then he talked to Mahan, who was in the third year hosting the Under Armour Hunter Mahan Championship outside Dallas as part of the AJGA circuit.\n\n\u201cHe had two exemptions he could give out, and I planted the seed with Hunter,\u201d Wood said. \u201cI told him this kid has not had much exposure, no one knows much about him because he hasn\u2019t played much nationally, but if you take a look at giving him an exemption, it will be worth your while. Hunter was awesome. He gave him a spot, and he ended up losing in a playoff. But it put him on the map and set him up to play in a lot of events.\u201d\n\nThe seed was planted, and the growth was rapid.\n\n\u201cThat kind of just spurred me on,\u201d Champ said. \u201cI got enough points, all the AJGA rankings to move up. I played my next one and next one, kept playing and got the rankings. And from there, it just kind of went on.\u201d\n\nHe said grants from the AJGA allowed him to travel. Champ was an AJGA All-American the next two years, played in the 2012 Junior Ryder Cup team and landed at Texas A&M, where he was slowed by back injuries his first two years.\n\nHe first got noticed on a big stage when he qualified for the 2017 U.S. Open at Erin Hills and led the field with an average drive of just under 350 yards. One year on the Web.com Tour the next season brought his first professional victory and a ticket to the big leagues.\n\nEverything about Champ is about big, starting with tee shots created by incredible speed without looking as though he\u2019s swinging hard.\n\nHe won the Sanderson Farms Championship by four shots with a late string of birdies. He was in the hunt last week at Mayakoba, a shorter golf course that demands precision off the tee, flighting his shots low and with movement. It wasn\u2019t just smashing driver. He showed off an array of shots.\n\nEven so, with Champ the conversation starts with power.\n\nHe tries not to get caught up in the attention, no small task considering he already has been featured in Golf Digest because of his swing speed. Starting with his power display at Erin Hills, he already is mentioned in the same category with Dustin Johnson, Brooks Koepka and the rest of the big hitters in golf.\n\nHe understands why he gets so much attention, though.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s kind of what our game\u2019s around right now \u2014 athletic players hit it far, and then once they learn how to hit wedges like DJ did, then the sky\u2019s the limit,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t bother me anymore. It never really bothered me before, but now with the attention, I just try to block it all out.\u201d\n\nHis goal when he earned his PGA Tour was to make all the cuts in the fall portion of the schedule, and he has done just that. The final stop is Sea Island, which starts Thursday on two courses (Seaside and Plantation) with a field that features Webb Simpson, Kevin Kisner, Zach Johnson and tournament host Davis Love III.", "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Veterans Drew Brees, Julius Peppers, Antonio Gates and Vernon Davis are among the 32 nominees for the NFL\u2019s Art Rooney Sportsmanship Award.\n\nEach team nominates a player for the award, created in 2014 in honor of the late founding owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers and a Pro Football Hall of Famer.

The safety of Indonesia\u2019s airlines had been questioned long before the Lion Air accident.\n\n\u201cThere has been a lot more trepidation about flying smaller airlines that Americans have never heard of\u201d since the Oct. 29 Lion Air crash, said Blake Fleetwood, president of Cook Travel in New York. \u201cIt is pushing people to the bigger airlines. People are scared.\u201d\n\nBefore plunking down big money to book international flights, nervous flyers can tap into resources that can provide red-flag warnings if there are doubts about a carrier\u2019s safety.\n\n\u2014 The Federal Aviation Administration determines whether countries meet international safety standards set by the United Nations\u2019 aviation agency. Five currently do not \u2014 Thailand, Bangladesh, Ghana, Curacao and Sint Maarten. Airlines from those countries can\u2019t launch new flights to the U.S. Indonesia got off the blacklist in 2016.\n\n\u2014 Europe bans 120 airlines from its skies. Most are smaller carriers from developing countries in Africa and parts of Asia. Lion Air was banned for nearly a decade until 2016; other blackballed Indonesian carriers only got off the list in June.\n\n\u2014 Aviation Safety Network has an accident database that can be searched by airline or country.\n\n\u2014 Websites like AirlineRatings.com rank carriers based on crash records and other data. That site gave Lion Air a rating of one star out of seven in 2016 but six out of seven last year, after U.S. and European regulators upgraded Indonesia\u2019s aviation regulatory regime.\n\nSuch ratings have their critics. Skytrax , a UK company that does research for airlines and surveys travelers on airline quality, says there is no objective way to rank airlines on safety due to uneven reporting of incidents by airlines and regulators around the world.\n\n\u2014 And there are companies such as Argus International that will provide reports on charter airlines. Since they charge a fee, typically $50 to $150, such services are mostly used by corporate travel departments.\n\nFatal airline accidents have been declining for about two decades. By some accounts, 2017 was the safest year yet. The Aviation Safety Network and To70 , an aviation consultant in the Netherlands, said there were no fatal crashes involving commercial passenger airlines last year. The reports excluded cargo planes, military aircraft, and flights on planes certified to carry fewer than 14 people.\n\n\u201cAviation safety has become much better even in places that were notoriously unsafe at one time,\u201d said Alberto Riva, managing editor of The Points Guy , a website for frequent flyers.\n\nWithin a country, Riva said, some airlines have better safety records than others. He said he would not worry about flying on Garuda Indonesia, the national carrier, \u201cbut if I could find a way to circumvent Lion Air, I would do that.\u201d\n\nFleetwood, the travel agent, said, \u201cI would steer clear of any airline that is not certified to fly to the European Union.\u201d\n\nMatt Kepnes, who wrote \u201cHow to Travel the World on $50 a Day,\u201d said he follows the news closely enough to have a sense of which airlines have good safety records. \u201cI don\u2019t do much digging beyond that unless it is an airline I haven\u2019t heard of, especially one that doesn\u2019t fly to the U.S. or (European Union), as they have tight airline regulations.

(AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Justice Department on Wednesday released an internal legal opinion supporting the legality of Matthew Whitaker\u2019s appointment as acting attorney general as Democrats press the case that President Donald Trump violated the law and Constitution by making Whitaker the country\u2019s chief law enforcement officer.\n\nThe 20-page opinion from the Office of Legal Counsel, which provides advice to executive branch agencies, aims to rebut mounting complaints that Trump illegally sidestepped procedure by appointing Whitaker over Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.\n\nRosenstein, the second-ranking Justice Department official, has been confirmed by the Senate and had been overseeing special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation. Whitaker had been chief of staff to now-ousted Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a job that didn\u2019t require Senate confirmation. He became acting attorney general when Sessions was forced out on Nov. 7 and was given oversight of Mueller\u2019s inquiry.\n\nSince then, the state of Maryland has challenged Whitaker\u2019s appointment, arguing that the top Justice Department job must be held by a Senate-confirmed official such as Rosenstein. A defense lawyer in Las Vegas is similarly arguing that a drug case involving his client should be halted if Whitaker was improperly appointed to lead the department.\n\nCongressional Democrats, meanwhile, have called the appointment unconstitutional and demanded that Whitaker recuse himself from overseeing the Mueller investigation. At least two former Republican attorneys general, Alberto Gonzales and Michael Mukasey, have also raised questions about it, and a handful of GOP senators are urging their leadership to hold a vote on legislation that would protect Mueller.\n\nIt was unclear whether the legal opinion would satisfy opponents of Whitaker\u2019s appointment, but the document does provide by far the most detailed defense from the Justice Department of a selection that has roiled Washington.\n\nThe opinion concludes that Whitaker, even without Senate confirmation, may serve in an acting capacity because he has been at the department for more than a year at a \u201csufficiently senior pay level.\u201d\n\nThe opinion tries to reconcile two seemingly conflicting statutes by saying that even though the department\u2019s own line of succession specifies that the deputy attorney general may hold the top spot in the event of a vacancy, a more general law known as the Vacancies Reform Act empowers presidents to depart from that order and to promote officials who haven\u2019t been confirmed by the Senate.\n\nAlthough Whitaker is not Senate confirmed and was not the deputy, the opinion concludes that he nonetheless satisfies a third element of the law by having been with the Justice Department for at least 90 days and earning high enough pay for consideration.\n\n\u201cAs all three branches of government have long recognized, the President may designate an acting official to perform the duties of a vacant principal office, including a Cabinet office, even when the acting official has not been confirmed by the Senate,\u201d the opinion said.\n\nThe opinion identified more than 160 times before 1860 in which non-Senate officials were temporarily appointed to fill vacancies as Cabinet secretaries or equivalent jobs, including some with no prior experience in federal government.\n\nIt said that both Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama had designated unconfirmed agency officials as acting agency heads and that Whitaker was not the first unconfirmed official to run an agency on an interim basis in the Trump administration.\n\nEven so, the opinion could identify only one instance, in 1866, when a non-Senate confirmed assistant attorney general became acting attorney general. The Justice Department was not established as its own agency until 1870.\n\n\u201cMr. Whitaker\u2019s designation is no more constitutionally problematic than countless similar presidential orders dating back over 200 years,\u201d the opinion says.\n\nStephen Vladeck, a University of Texas at Austin law professor, said that although the Justice Department\u2019s legal analysis appeared sound, the circumstances surrounding the Whitaker appointment may be \u201cradically different from what any of these historical examples were dealing with.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe one point (on) which I can hope everyone can agree is, whatever your bottom line is, Congress should fix this,\u201d he added. \u201cCongress should limit the circumstances in which the president can bypass Senate-confirmed officers in the same agency.\u201d\n\nA Justice Department official said the White House contacted the Office of Legal Counsel for advice, before Sessions was replaced, about options in the event of a vacancy. The department made the official available to brief reporters only on the condition that the official not be identified by name. The official would not say when exactly the White House had requested the office\u2019s advice.\n\nThe opinion didn\u2019t address the question of whether Whitaker should step aside from overseeing Muller\u2019s investigation into potential coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia.\n\nMany Democrats have called on Whitaker to withdraw from that role, citing derogatory comments that Whitaker made about the inquiry before joining the department. The investigation until now had been overseen by Rosenstein.\n\n___\n\nOnline:\n\nLegal opinion: https://tinyurl.com/ycc8zzad", "All Japan catcher Takuya Kai (62) is celebrated by teammates on the mound after beating MLB All-Stars 6-5 in Game 5 at their All-Stars Series baseball at Nagoya Dome in Nagoya, central Japan, Wednesday, Nov. 14, 2018.

The U.N. does not want the government to send the refugees back under current circumstances.\n\nDetails of the repot were not shared, but Kalam said they wanted to be \u201chopeful\u201d in beginning the repatriation on Thursday.\n\n\u201cWe hope we will be able to confirm tomorrow morning (Thursday) how many we are taking,\u201d he said.\n\nThe two countries had originally agreed to begin repatriating Rohingya to Rakhine State last January, but that was called off amid concerns among aid workers and the Rohingya that their safety wasn\u2019t guaranteed.\n\nKalam said about 2,260 refugees from 485 families would be sent back in an initial group. Myanmar officials said recently that they would receive 150 refugees each day.\n\nBut it was unclear whether the repatriation would begin smoothly amid reports that many of the refugees on the initial list have fled.\n\n\u201cI will not go. My wife and other family members have gone elsewhere, they do not want to go,\u201d 35-year-old Nurul Amin told The Associated Press outside the Jamtoli camp, where he and his family have been living for more than a year.\n\n\u201cI stayed back to guard my valuables,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you say you will shoot us if we do not agree to go back, we will welcome bullets, we still will not go.\u201d\n\nMohammed Selim, 23, said his wife and seven other family members went into hiding after finding out that they would be sent back.\n\n\u201cWe are grateful to the Bangladesh government, the Bangladeshi people for their help. Please do not force us to go,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf we need to go, we demand that we go back to our homes, not to any camps there. We have our land, we have our homes,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Sunday, the Myanmar government said it was ready to welcome returning refugees.\n\nIt said returning Rohingya would stay at repatriation camps for two days and receive food and clothing before moving on to transit camps. It said China, India and Japan were \u201cproviding necessary assistance\u201d for the repatriation process.\n\nDespite the promises by Myanmar, human rights activists say conditions are not yet safe for their return.\n\nLast week, the U.N.\u2019s independent investigator for human rights in Myanmar, Yanghee Lee, called the plans \u201crushed\u201d and said she was concerned there were no guarantees that the refugees would be protected from new persecution if they return home.\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross is one of the few humanitarian organizations operating in Rakhine state. Its U.N. observer, Robert Mardini, said Wednesday that conditions are not right for Rohingya refugees to return.\n\nHe told several reporters that the conflict between the Rohingya and Myanmar\u2019s government is not resolved, and \u201cso many\u201d Rohingya villages in northern Rakhine are flattened that there is no place to go back to.\n\n\u201cWe still believe that the conditions are not right for voluntary, safe, dignified returns, and our concerns are for people to be able to move freely, to be safe and secure, and have a normal life,\u201d Mardini said. \u201cNobody can claim today that the security in Rakhine is so well established that people can return safely.\u201d\n\nForeign leaders have criticized Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi this week on the sidelines of a summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Singapore for her handling of the Rohingya crisis.\n\nRohingya began fleeing into Bangladesh after Myanmar security forces launched a brutal crackdown following attacks by an insurgent group on guard posts in August 2017. The scale, organization and ferocity of the operation led to accusations from the international community, including the United Nations, of ethnic cleansing and even genocide. Myanmar\u2019s government has denied the accusations.\n\nMyanmar officials said Sunday that returnees can get an ID document called a national verification card that will allow them to travel in the Maungdaw area of Rakhine state, and that they can then begin to apply for citizenship.\n\nBut there is widespread skepticism that any of returning refugees will ever be granted citizenship.\n\nMost people in Buddhist-majority Myanmar do not accept that the Rohingya Muslims are a native ethnic group. They are viewed as \u201cBengalis\u201d who entered illegally from Bangladesh, even though generations of Rohingya have lived in Myanmar. Nearly all have been denied citizenship since 1982, effectively rendering them stateless. They have also been denied freedom of movement and other basic rights.\n\nMany people who fled earlier violence and moved into displacement camps inside Myanmar have been unable to leave those settlements for years.\n\nMost Rohingya have lived in poverty in Rakhine, near the Bangladesh border. Marked by their religion and their language \u2014 most speak a dialect of Bengali, while most of their neighbors speak Rakhine \u2014 they are easy to target.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Tofayel Ahmad in Cox\u2019s Bazar and Edith M.

In this landscape of challenging, provocative, edgy films, Viggo Mortensen, Mahershala Ali and, of all people, director Peter Farrelly have come along with a movie about friendship that goes down so easy that it\u2019s almost suspect, as though it were flung out of 1996 and gifted to our weary 2018 brains.\n\nBased on a true story, \u201cGreen Book\u201d recounts a 1962 road trip when a Bronx bred Italian-American Frank Anthony Vallelonga, also known as Tony Lip (Mortensen), was hired to drive a renowned black pianist, Dr. Don Shirley (Ali), to all of his concert engagements across the Deep South.\n\nThe two men are obviously mismatched \u2014 what would anyone have to learn if they weren\u2019t? Tony is a working-class bruiser and world class eater with a wife (Linda Cardellini), two sons, a limited vocabulary, institutional racism, but a generally good heart. Dr. Shirley is a wealthy, erudite dandy, a master of his art, a snob and a loner. He also knows he needs reliable protection on this journey to a segregated south, asks around and finds this Copacabana bouncer Tony Lip is the one for the job despite the prejudices.\n\nThe constructs will feel familiar and well-worn and surprises are few on this journey toward acceptance and friendship, but the pleasure of this film is in the larger than life characters created by the two leads and their perfectly askew chemistry. Mortensen is almost unrecognizable as Tony, packing extra pounds and an astute comedic sensibility. He knows just how far to push his caricature without making it cartoonish. When Dr. Shirley says to make sure that there\u2019s a Steinway piano at every concert venue, Tony scribbles down \u201cSTAINWAY\u201d on a sheet of paper. His doltishness is endearing, not annoying.\n\nAnd Ali, so memorable and heart-wrenching in \u201cMoonlight,\u201d puts his own stamp on a character who feels alienated from his own race and those he\u2019s performing for. Although a considerably more staid role than Tony, Ali also manages to have his own fun with Dr. Shirley\u2019s seemingly incurable snobbery, wincing at Tony\u2019s lack of decorum, or care.\n\nIn fact, this film allows everyone to play against their Hollywood-prescribed \u201ctype,\u201d from the actors to the director, who is perhaps the most surprising revelation of them all.\n\nThe Farrelly name conjures up a very specific kind of movie: The big, bawdy comedy that he and his brother made their own and, later, failed to keep fresh. If anything, the charm and success of \u201cGreen Book\u201d makes a heck of a case for giving directors more room to work outside of the genres or styles that they became famous for.\n\nThere is certainly a more serious story to be told out of this road trip, and about Dr. Shirley\u2019s extraordinary life. \u201cGreen Book,\u201d taken from the title of the guide Tony has to use to find the establishments and hotels where people of color are welcome at throughout the South, scratches at the surface of the horrors and indignities Dr. Shirley faced while being a \u201cguest of honor.\u201d Those range from being asked to use an outdoor toilet to being denied the right to dine in the place he\u2019s about to perform. This film chooses a different route, and is in turn funny, heart-warming, illuminating and a joy to watch.\n\n\u201cGreen Book,\u201d a Universal Pictures release, is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association of America for \u201cthematic content, language including racial epithets, smoking, some violence and suggestive material.\u201d Running time: 130 minutes.

The crash came as a winter storm has been raking parts of the South. (Joe Rondone/The Commercial Appeal via AP)\n\nBYHALIA, Miss. (AP) \u2014 An Alabama tour bus bound for a Mississippi casino overturned Wednesday on an icy highway, leaving two people dead and 44 others aboard with injuries, authorities said, as a pre-winter storm blasted parts of the South and lower Midwest.\n\nThe National Weather Service says snow and ice fell during the day across parts of Mississippi, Arkansas, Tennessee, Missouri, Kentucky, Indiana and Illinois. Snow and ice are predicted Thursday and Friday for areas ranging from Ohio and the Appalachian Mountains through Washington, D.C., New York and New England from the storm barreling toward the Northeast.\n\nWitnesses told Mississippi investigators that the bus driver lost control after crossing an icy overpass and the bus rolled over on its driver\u2019s side, coming to rest in median of Interstate 269 in Byhalia around 12:35 p.m., said Mississippi Highway Patrol spokesman Capt. Johnny Poulos. That Mississippi town is about 35 miles (55 kilometers) southeast of downtown Memphis, Tennessee.\n\nKilled were 70-year-old Betty Russell and 61-year-old Cynthia Hardin, both of Huntsville, Alabama, said DeSoto County Coroner Joshua Pounders. The injured were taken to Memphis-area hospitals, with at least three listed in serious condition Wednesday evening. Officials said the group was bound from Huntsville, Alabama, to gamble at a casino in Mississippi\u2019s Tunica County, about 40 miles (65 kilometers) to the west.\n\nAuthorities say two people have died and several others are injured, some critically, after a tour bus overturned on an icy highway ramp in northern Mississippi. (Nov. 14)\n\nThe red tour bus with white and gray stripes was later towed from the crash site, its windows mostly missing and a smell of gasoline lingering in the air. Large scratches and other damage were visible on the driver\u2019s side.\n\nPoulos said investigators hadn\u2019t yet concluded how fast the bus was traveling. He said because the road was icy, investigators have no skid marks to evaluate as part of their investigation.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t really tell what the vehicle did,\u201d said Poulos, adding more findings could be available Thursday.\n\nThe bus was operated by Teague VIP Express, based in Anniston, Alabama. The company posted a message on its Facebook page that said: \u201cOur hearts and prayers go out to victims of this tragedy. Please keep everyone involved and families in your prayers.\u201d\n\nThe company has only three buses and three drivers, according to licensing information from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. The agency gives Teague a satisfactory rating and lists no crashes in the last two years.\n\nHowever, agency records show Teague had three buses fail random unannounced inspections in February 2017: One bus was ordered off the road because of worn, welded or missing steering system components and a second bus was ordered off the road because of steering problems and defective or missing axle parts. A third bus was ordered off the road because of a cracked or broken wheel or rim, records show.\n\nA Teague driver was ordered out of service in September 2017 after an Alabama traffic stop found the driver didn\u2019t have the required duty status records, according to the records.\n\nThere was no indication Wednesday\u2019s crash was related to the violations.\n\nFederal Motor Carrier Safety Administration spokesman Willam DeBruyne declined to comment on Teague VIP\u2019s safety record. He said a bus is only ordered out of service because of an \u201cimminent hazard.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so egregious that the vehicle cannot be allowed to operate,\u201d he said.\n\nThe coroner declined to describe the causes of the deaths and no autopsies were planned.\n\nIn Washington, National Transportation Safety Board spokesman Keith Holloway said the federal agency hasn\u2019t determined yet whether it will investigate Wednesday\u2019s crash.\n\nIt was the second charter bus excursion to a Mississippi casino town to end in fatalities in two years. A bus carrying Texas senior citizens to a Gulf Coast casino in Biloxi, Mississippi, got stuck on train tracks and was slammed by a freight train in March 2017. The crash resulted in four deaths and 38 injuries. The NTSB found that the probable cause of the crash was the failure of a railroad and the city to work together to improve the safety of a sharply humped railroad crossing where it was well known that vehicles occasionally got stuck.\n\nAround the upper South, meanwhile, the storm spread scattered sleet and light snow. Flash flood watches were posted for parts of Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia. Freeze warnings were posted as far south as the Gulf Coast. And in Virginia, NASA said, the planned launch early Thursday of an unmanned cargo rocket to the International Space Station had to be rescheduled by one day because of the weather.

(AP) \u2014 Supporters of a $100 million incentive bill designed to keep open a Kimberly-Clark Corp. plant in northeastern Wisconsin argued Wednesday that taking no action would be devastating for the Appleton area and the entire state, though they remain short of the votes they need.\n\nThe paper products giant, which was founded nearly 150 years ago in Wisconsin and is now based in Dallas, is urging lawmakers to act to save nearly 400 jobs as it weighs closing either that Wisconsin plant or one in Arkansas.\n\nAt a public hearing before the Legislature\u2019s budget committee Wednesday, the bill\u2019s Republican author, state Sen. Roger Roth, admitted he still doesn\u2019t have the votes needed to pass it, despite the GOP\u2019s 18-15 majority. No Democratic senator has come out publicly in support of the bill, which the Assembly passed in March, and four Republicans have publicly opposed it, including one \u2014 state Sen. Luther Olsen \u2014 who expressed skepticism at the hearing.\n\nKimberly-Clark originally asked for resolution by the end of September but agreed to wait to make a final decision about the plant until the Legislature acts at the urging of Gov. Scott Walker and others.\n\nCompany vice president John Deitrich testified that the tax incentive bill was a \u201cgame changer\u201d and that if it were passed, the company would keep the plant open and instead close the one in Arkansas. But Democrats and Olsen expressed skepticism.\n\n\u201cI am not convinced that this is the right thing for the state to do,\u201d said Olsen, who peppered Deitrich with questions about the company\u2019s profits and expenses that Deitrich didn\u2019t answer.\n\nOpponents, including a coalition of conservative groups, have cast the measure as a corporate giveaway and said the government shouldn\u2019t be picking winners and losers. But Republican Assembly Majority Leader Jim Steineke and others said the question was whether to save the jobs and the economic impact of Kimberly-Clark on the state or lose them.\n\n\u201cWe act and they stay or we don\u2019t act and they go,\u201d Steineke said.\n\nDemocratic committee members also expressed concern about its costs, the precedent it would set and the fact that they weren\u2019t involved in developing the proposal.\n\nThe incentives are modeled after the $3 billion package passed for Foxconn Technology Group, which is building a display screen manufacturing campus in Mount Pleasant.\n\nThe nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau estimates the current bill would cost the state $109 million over 15 years, assuming jobs for 610 employees at both plants earning more than $70,000 would be retained. If only one plant were kept open, with 388 jobs, the cost to the state would be less.\n\nThe bill would extend company state tax credits for 17 percent of certain payroll costs and 15 percent of capital investment in exchange for retaining jobs. It would essentially go to Kimberly-Clark as a cash payment since its corporate income tax liability has been eliminated thanks to Wisconsin\u2019s manufacturing and agriculture credit.\n\nWalker backs the plan as a way to save the jobs for the Cold Spring plant in Fox Crossing that is the only one in North America that makes Depend adult incontinence products. Wisconsin Democratic Gov.-elect Tony Evers did not voice support for the bill in a statement Wednesday from his spokeswoman Britt Cudaback.\n\nEvers supports a \u201clong-term, industry-wide solution to the challenges facing the paper industry\u201d like a proposal put forward by Democratic state Sen. Dave Hansen, Cudaback said.\n\nKimberly-Clark, which makes Kleenex tissues, Huggies diapers and other paper products, said in January that it planned to close both the Fox Crossing and smaller Neenah plant that employs about 110 people as part of the company\u2019s plan to cut up to 5,500 jobs and close or sell 10 plants worldwide. Its North American consumer business is headquartered in Neenah, Wisconsin, where the company was founded in 1872. Wisconsin is home to about 3,000 Kimberly-Clark employees.\n\nThe Fox Crossing plant employs about 388 people but that would increase by 52 jobs and Kimberly-Clark could invest another $500 million in the facility over the next 15 years if the bill passes, Deitrich testified.\n\n___\n\nFollow Scott Bauer on Twitter: https://twitter.com/sbauerAP\n\n___\n\nSign up for \u201cPolitics in Focus,\u201d a weekly newsletter showcasing the AP\u2019s best political reporting from around the country leading up to the midterm elections: https://bit.ly/2ICEr3D", "MILLVILLE, N.J.

Such devices could be everything from household appliances like refrigerators and air conditioners to warehouse delivery systems, smart traffic signs and aerial drones.\n\n\u201cThe scale of Chinese state support for the IoT, the close supply chain integration between the United States and China, and China\u2019s role as an economic and military competitor to the United States creates enormous economic, security, supply chain, and data privacy risks for the United States,\u201d the report says.\n\nThe commission, which does not set policy but can make recommendations to Congress and the U.S. administration, is warning that the potential impact of malicious cyberattacks through such systems will intensify with the adoption of ultra-fast 5G networks that could quicken data speeds by up to 100 times.\n\n\u201cThe lax security protections and universal connectivity of IoT devices creates numerous points of vulnerability that hackers or malicious state actors can exploit to hold U.S. critical infrastructure, businesses, and individuals at risk,\u201d the report says.\n\nThe United States has already taken some steps to restrict the use of Chinese-made high technology. For example, it has restricted government procurement from Chinese tech giants Huawei and ZTE, which deny their products are used for spying by China\u2019s authoritarian government.\n\nIn June, the Defense Department suspended the purchase of all commercial, off-the-shelf drones until a cybersecurity risk assessment strategy was established. In 2017, U.S. customs authorities alleged that drones produced by Chinese company DJI, which has dominated the U.S. and Canadian drone markets, likely provided China with access to U.S. critical infrastructure and law enforcement data. DJI denied the allegation.\n\nThe commission is calling for Congress to push for assessments by U.S. government agencies on their supply chain vulnerabilities. It says the U.S. government depends on commercial, off-the-shelf products, many of them made in China, for more than 95 percent of its electronics components and information technology systems.\n\nLarge U.S. telecommunications providers also rely on global supply chains dominated by Chinese manufacturers. Although they do not source directly from Huawei and ZTE, major U.S. telecommunications providers rely on other foreign 5G network equipment suppliers that incorporate Chinese manufacturing in their supply chains, the report says.", "HOLLAND, Vt. (AP) \u2014 Firefighters in Vermont say fuel from a gas-powered water pump inside a barn ignited and caused a fire that caused several injuries and killed some calves.\n\nThe Caledonian Record reports one worker at the Champney farm in Holland suffered burns to his hands, face, and hair after trying to stop the fire Tuesday. Others suffered smoke inhalation working to get 163 calves and heifers out of the barn.\n\nKim Champney said the rest of the farm\u2019s nearly 300 milking cows were safe in a larger, new barn.\n\nThe damage was contained to one section, which will have to be torn down.\n\nThe Champneys are the farmers who want to host a large wind turbine on their farm field.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Caledonian-Record, http://www.caledonianrecord.com", "YAOUNDE, Cameroon (AP) \u2014 Cameroon\u2019s military has killed at least 30 separatists in two days of intense fighting in the turbulent English-speaking North West region, a military spokesman said Wednesday.\n\nThe military freed people held by separatists during its two-day operation, military spokesman Col. Didier Badjeck said Wednesday. Fighting was intense in the Mayo Binka area near Nkambe, he said. While no soldiers have been killed, he said the death toll for armed separatists may increase, as fighters escape into the bush.\n\nIn a separate incident, the mayor of Nwa, a local council in the same region, was found dead Wednesday and he is believed to have been killed by separatists, said Emmanuel Bunyui, the mayor of the nearby town of Ndu. Many mayors in English-speaking regions have been targeted by armed separatists demanding an independent English-speaking state, which they call Ambazonia.\n\n\u201cWhen we hoist the Cameroon flag in the council premises, we are targeted by the armed men who insist that we should instead display their blue and white flag,\u201d Bunyui said.\n\nThese incidents have highlighted the separatist unrest in Cameroon, which began in 2016, when English-speaking teachers and lawyers in the northwest and southwest staged demonstrations calling for reforms, criticizing what they called the marginalization of the Anglophone population, which accounts for about one-fifth of the country\u2019s 25 million people.\n\nViolence increased after factions of separatists armed themselves following a government clampdown on protests in 2017. Armed separatists have vowed to destabilize the regions and hundreds of civilians have been killed and dozens of schools have been burned and teachers threatened.\n\nIn the past year, more than 1,200 people including separatists, police, military and gendarmes have been killed in the fighting, according to military spokesman Badjeck.\n\nRecently 79 students and three staff were kidnapped from a school by suspected separatists, and they have all now been released.\n\nMore than 100 civilians have escaped the violence and fled to the capital, Yaounde.\n\n\u201cI am just going to nowhere. I am afraid,\u201d said Kenneth Kongyu, 19, who joined 75 other people who walked 60 kilometers (37 miles) for two days to escape violence in Ndu, Bunyui\u2019s town. \u201cWhen they come to the market, they shoot from every angle.\u201d\n\nTatah Oscar, 17, said he is a former fighter. He said many young Cameroonians are joining the separatists because their families have been killed by military \u201cso they don\u2019t have somebody to count on again ... I am pleading on the government to try and solve the problem so that we the youths we can go back to school.\u201d\n\nCol. Badjeck, however, said \u201cMost of the time the terrorists operate and hide among civilians and the world has an impression that civilians are being killed, but our military is professional.\u201d\n\nIn November last year, Cameroonian President Paul Biya declared the crisis a war. Biya was re-elected to his seventh term in October, although few votes were cast in war-torn Anglophone regions.\n\nPoliticians have repeatedly called on Biya to initiate dialogue to stem the violence. The 85-year-old president, who has ruled Cameroon since 1982, has repeatedly stated that Cameroon is one and indivisible and that he is not ready to negotiate.\n\nThe conflict poses a serious challenge for Cameroon, a close U.S. security ally in combating extremism and a new member of the U.N. Human Rights Council. The United Nations have condemned both the Cameroon military and separatists for using unnecessary and excessive force and Amnesty International criticized the \u201chorrific escalation of violence\u201d in English-speaking regions.\n\nNearly a quarter-million more people have fled the ongoing violence, many leaving their homes on foot with their belongings teetering on their heads.", "CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va.

But his friendly, gregarious nature quickly puts the people he meets at ease.\n\nThe Waco Tribune-Herald reports he is the kind of guy most people would want to have a beer with. That\u2019s what makes Colton good at his job and why he so easily earns the trust of those he is trying to help.\n\nColton, a vocational rehabilitation counselor, is one of 822 employees who work for the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office, the 123,000-square-foot, box-like structure at 701 Clay Ave. in Waco.\n\nWhen he is not trying to help a veteran apply for funding for additional education or find a meaningful vocation, Colton volunteers with veterans\u2019 groups, leading camping and team-building retreats for veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety disorders or other service-related ailments.\n\nHe gets to know veterans while huddled around campfires and gazing at stars.\n\nLike 66 percent of the employees at the VA Regional Office, where the motto is \u201cvets helping vets,\u201d Colton is a veteran. The Bunker Hill, Indiana, native spent 23 years in the Air Force, retiring in 2010 as a master sergeant. The son of an Air Force B-58 navigator, Colton was a maintenance instructor for the B-2 bomber and spent 2007-2008 in Iraq training Iraqi forces in aircraft maintenance.\n\nIt\u2019s people like Colton, veterans and others with a sincere desire to help the nation\u2019s veterans, who have worked hard to transform what was considered one of the worst-performing of the nation\u2019s 56 VA regional offices eight years ago \u2014 if not the worst \u2014 to the top-rated office in the country in terms of efficiency, accuracy and benefit claims processed.\n\nSome of the credit for improved efficiency at the much-maligned agency was the conversion to electronic files from what once were 12-inch-thick paper file folders.\n\nIt allowed the local office to clear out a football-field sized storage area on the second floor of the building and use it for office space as it was intended.\n\nOther credit for the turnaround can be given to the leadership of Regional Office Director John Limpose, a 6-foot-7 former college basketball player from Ohio who subscribes to the late, great UCLA basketball coach John Wooden\u2019s \u201cPyramid of Success\u201d and quotes former Green Bay Packers coach Vince Lombardi.\n\n\u201cIn 2012, when I got here, there was a lot of bad press about Waco being one of the worst offices in the country, and it took a toll on the employees,\u201d Limpose said. \u201cWe were taking a beating in The New York Times to the Wall Street Journal to the San Diego Tribune that we were the worst from coast to coast.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think it was justified, but we had the motto: \u2018We have to scale Mount Everest,\u2019\u201d Limpose said. \u201cWe just decided to hunker down, roll up our sleeves and go after it, and we did. We reduced our inventory of cases from 52,000 to 16,000 and reduced our backlog from 41,000 to under 2,000. At that time, our average to process a claim was 474 days and we got it down to 130 days, and last fiscal year, we processed cases in 92 days. There is no magic silver bullet here. We just hunkered down and did a lot of good old-fashioned hard work.\u201d\n\nLast year, the Waco regional office paid out $4.2 billion in disability compensation, compared to six years ago, when it paid $2.3 billion, Limpose said.\n\nLimpose, who is not a veteran but comes from a long line who served, said he and VA employees take pride that Waco was the top-performing office in the country in fiscal year 2018. The office set a national record by processing 80,102 disability claims and did it with 94 percent accuracy, he said.\n\nLimpose credits the turnaround to employees like Colton and Sheila Bounds and Kim Donna, both rating veterans service representatives; Margarita Bell, a claims assistant; Ernesto Garcia, a decision review officer; Dexter Douglas, an accounts receivable technician; and Al Miller, a coach in the veterans service center.\n\nTo the person, those employees say they strive to ensure that disabled veterans earn every benefit they are entitled to, even going out of their way if initial efforts don\u2019t produce ideal results to try to gain more information or other documentation that might qualify a veteran for more benefits.\n\nThey also say that because they all are veterans, some disabled veterans, it helps them better understand what the claimants are going through and to connect with them in a more meaningful way.\n\nColton, for example, said he was lost when he got out of the Air Force. He had spent two decades with someone telling him what to wear, where to go, what to do, what to eat, and it was a bit of a culture shock when he became a civilian, he said. He suffered from depression and anxiety and sought help.\n\n\u201cI was ready to give up,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now, it helps me know what these guys are going through. I\u2019ve lost friends through suicide, and it is heartbreaking.\u201d\n\nBounds, a West Virginia native, joined the Army in 1990. Her father was a Navy veteran, and her grandfather, a World War II Japanese prisoner of war for four years, survived the infamous Bataan Death March of April 1942, a 65-mile forced march of 75,000 American and Filipino troops to prison camps.\n\nBounds started her career in military intelligence as a Czech linguist. She was a 1st sergeant and spent time in Germany and Yugoslavia. She was sent to Iraq in 2006, where she ran a detention facility and was in charge of interrogators.\n\n\u201cIt was a very tough deployment because my brigade took a lot of losses,\u201d she said.\n\nAfter a \u201cless stressful\u201d deployment to Baghdad in 2009, she retired in 2010. Her husband, Harold Hall, retired from the Army in 2008 after a 21-year career and three deployments to Iraq.\n\nBounds, who has a bachelor\u2019s in psychology and a master\u2019s in human resources development, used part of the G.I. Bill to earn her degrees between deployments. She has been working at the VA Regional Office in Waco since 2011.\n\nHer and Donna\u2019s jobs as rating veterans service representatives is to handle what are deemed priority claims or more difficult claims with multiple disability contentions. Priority claims include terminally ill or homeless veterans or those with financial hardship claims.\n\n\u201cI almost feel like this is my calling,\u201d Bounds said. \u201cI love this job so much. Each veteran deserves our time on each claim. A lot of them grab at your heartstrings when you look at their records and see what so many of them have done for our country. No veteran is going to get brushed aside. They all deserve their shot, and if there is any way that we can grant their claims, we will.\u201d\n\nDonna, a Kempner native, enrolled at the University of Texas at Austin before realizing, as she put it, that she needed more structure in her life. She joined the Army, thinking she would get life experience and then continue her education on the G.I. Bill.\n\nThe next thing she knew, she was in Germany after training as a combat medic at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio. Five weeks later she was in Iraq, manning what was supposed to be a four-man stretcher with just one other soldier and evacuating wounded troops to helicopters so they could go for treatment.\n\nDonna also comes from a long line of military family members. Her grandfather served in Korea, her father in Desert Storm. Both her younger sister and brother were in the Army in Iraq, and her husband served in Afghanistan.\n\nShe has been diagnosed with PTSD and has nightmares and flashbacks. She can watch old movies about historic wars but cannot watch movies from the Gulf War era.\n\nLike others at the office, Donna retired from service at Fort Hood, which provides a steady pipeline of job applicants to the VA Regional Office in Waco.\n\nDonna and Bounds said they gain satisfaction from helping veterans get the benefits they seek.\n\n\u201cI think it is an affront to the veteran if we don\u2019t provide our service as efficiently as we can and do all we can for them,\u201d Donna said.\n\nBoth said they enjoy helping World War II veterans get approved for hearing aids, especially the many who have never filed a disability claim in their lives but whose hearing is decreasing as they age.\n\n\u201cThat makes me very happy and I get a lot of satisfaction in making that call to tell a veteran to tell him we can pay for his hearing aid,\u201d Bounds said.\n\nWhen veterans decide to file a claim, among the first to see it is a claims assistant, like Bell, a Chicago native who joined the Navy in 1986. She retired seven years later to raise her family while her husband, John, had a 24-year Navy career before retiring in 2004. She has a 28-year-old daughter in the Navy who is stationed in South Carolina.\n\nShe has infrequent contact with veterans but inputs their claim information into the system. She normally is assigned 100 claim packets a day and is required to finish at least 34 of those. She said the largest claim she has handled involved 64 contentions, or conditions such as back, knee or shoulder ailments and others.\n\n\u201cI wanted to stay in the Navy, but I left to raise my kids while we followed my husband from place to place,\u201d Bell said. \u201cSince I couldn\u2019t stay active duty, I feel like I am giving back here to help the veterans. It is just fulfilling to know I can do something, even if it is a small part.\u201d\n\nOnce a decision is made about a veteran\u2019s benefits and his or her level of disability, an unhappy veteran can appeal to someone like Garcia, a decision review officer. About 12 percent of all decisions are appealed, Limpose said.\n\nGarcia, who was born in Mexico, moved to Dublin, Texas, with his family when he was 10. When an appeal hits his desk, he reviews the file to determine if the law was properly applied. He sometimes requires more information or more documentation before making his decision.\n\n\u201cBasically, my job is to make a decision. If I can grant it, I will grant it,\u201d said Garcia, who also works as a freelance photographer for the Tribune-Herald.\n\nGarcia joined the Marine Corps when he was 17 and was given a medical discharge after he was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes in 2003.\n\nHe said the agency\u2019s goal is to complete the appeals process within 125 days.\n\nU.S. Rep. Bill Flores, R-Bryan, said his office was flooded with complaints from veterans about the Waco VA Regional Office and the nearby Doris Miller Veterans Affairs Medical Center. In the years since, he said he has noticed vast improvements in the regional office and an associated decrease in complaints.\n\n\u201cWhen I was elected in 2010 and came into office, the Waco regional office was one of the worst in the country in terms of backlog and timely and accurately processing claims,\u201d Flores said. \u201cNow they are among the best. They are not perfect. They are like any other bureaucracy. They are going to have their problems. But Director Limpose and all the employees have done a good job of putting veterans first and addressing the issues veterans have. I am really impressed with what they have been able to do.\u201d\n\nFlores invited McLennan County Veterans Service Officer Steve Hernandez to speak before a congressional committee to address the problems at the VA Regional Office in 2012. Hernandez, too, said he has noticed a vast improvement over the past six years but still hears complaints about the length of time an appeal in a benefits claim case can take.\n\nHe said he blames the system, not the workers in Waco.\n\n\u201cThere was a major problem back then that caused a severe backlog,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cIt all has materialized to the point that it is back to being effective. Honestly, back then when we were all upset, the people who work there are tremendous. They are local people. They work in the community. They have the intent to do everything they are supposed to do. It was the system. It can be very tedious and bureaucratic and that creates this logjam. But the people have always been very courteous and cordial. I don\u2019t have anything but respect for them.\u201d\n\nOne of the problems is that the Waco regional office covers 164 of the 254 counties in Texas, more than 158,000 square miles. There are a lot of veterans in that area, the largest in the country with the exception of Alaska, which has only one veterans regional office for the entire state.\n\n\u201cIt is a big job, but we enjoy doing it,\u201d Limpose said.\n\nBecause of the size of the area, 122 of the 822 employees work in offices in El Paso, Austin, Dallas, Tyler, Abilene, Amarillo, Lubbock and Fort Hood.\n\n\u201cMr. Limpose is really good at analyzing the data and getting the teams to work really closely together and getting them to achieve the most they can achieve,\u201d said Tom Morley, assistant veterans service center manager. \u201cThat is one reason we had the big reduction in backlogs.\u201d\n\nIn describing improvements to the office, Limpose likes to quote Wooden, the old UCLA coach who won 10 national titles, including \u201cbeing average means you are just as close to the bottom as you are to the top.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s be at the top half. We have come a long way here,\u201d Limpose said. \u201cTo me, it all really falls back to hard work, dedication. If you don\u2019t have time to do it right the first time, when are you going to find time to do it again? I read his book, \u2018Wooden on Leadership.\u2019 No matter if you are playing sports or integrating it into business, little things done well is probably the greatest secret to success. Obviously, we would like to be 100 percent accurate on every decision, but we try to do the best with what we\u2019ve got. That\u2019s a Vince Lombardi quote, by the way.\u201d\n\nOthers who have helped the Waco office improve are Al Miller, a supervisor in the Veterans Service Center, and Dexter Douglas, an accounts receivable technician.\n\nMiller joined the Army in 1983 after high school in Dermott, Arkansas. He is a Desert Storm veteran who started his military career manning a fence line between East and West Germany.\n\nDouglas grew up in Montgomery, Alabama, and won the Bronze Star in Desert Storm as a fire direction chief in a field artillery division. He served 20 years in the Army and has worked for the VA regional office eight years.\n\nBoth say their time in the military has proved invaluable to their work at the VA and that it is rewarding to help those who served.\n\n\u201cI think when you take a look, I think it is less than 2 percent of all Americans who served, and we have all these freedoms and rights,\u201d Limpose said. \u201cIt is only because of people who put their lives on the line, some who gave it all, and most of these folks in this building are veterans themselves. So we take a lot of pride in all those entitlements veterans are entitled to.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about helping and all about doing the right thing, and that is what we do. It\u2019s about making a difference in people\u2019s lives. Every day we make a difference.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Waco Tribune-Herald, http://www.wacotrib.com", "DELLWOOD, Mo.

Berget, 56, was pronounced dead 12 minutes after the lethal injection of the barbiturate pentobarbital began.\n\nA national group that compiles information on capital punishment said the state should release more details about the drug used.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know the manufacturing process that was involved, we don\u2019t know the age of the drugs and the comment is consistent with remarks made by other prisoners who had been executed using drugs that\u201d may have been outdated or impure, said Robert Dunham, executive director of the nonprofit Death Penalty Information Center, which doesn\u2019t take a position on capital punishment but is critical of the way it\u2019s administered.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, it could simply be an expression of surprise, and without transparency by the state, we won\u2019t know the answers,\u201d he said.\n\nThe state Department of Corrections didn\u2019t immediately respond to an email from The Associated Press seeking comment on Berget\u2019s last words.\n\nAfter the drug was administered at 7:25 p.m., Berget groaned and pushed out his chest. He drifted off and snored briefly before his eyes closed. He was pronounced dead at 7:37 p.m. CDT. The transcript shows Berget\u2019s last words were, \u201cIs it supposed to feel like that?\u201d\n\nThe widow of the corrections officer killed by Berget, Lynette Johnson, witnessed the execution.

I can feel that,\u201d he said before slipping into unconsciousness.\n\nDunham said South Dakota should reveal the source and manufacturer of the drug, the production date, any initial and revised expiration dates and the storage and transportation conditions. State lawmakers in 2013 approved hiding the identities of its drug suppliers.\n\nBerget was serving a life sentence for attempted murder and kidnapping when he and another inmate, Eric Robert, attacked Johnson on April 12, 2011, in a part of the penitentiary known as Pheasantland Industries, where inmates work on upholstery, signs, furniture and other projects.\n\nJohnson turned 63 on the day that he was killed, and he was nearing the end of a nearly 24-year career as a guard.\n\nAfter Johnson was beaten, Robert put on Johnson\u2019s pants, hat and jacket and pushed a cart loaded with two boxes, one with Berget inside, toward the exits. They made it outside one gate but were stopped by another guard before they could complete their escape through a second gate. Berget admitted to his role in the slaying.\n\nRobert was executed on Oct. 15, 2012.\n\nBerget\u2019s mental status and death penalty eligibility played a role in court delays. Berget in 2016 appealed his death sentence, but later asked to withdraw the appeal against his lawyers\u2019 advice. Berget wrote to a judge saying he thought the death penalty would be overturned and that he couldn\u2019t imagine spending \u201canother 30 years in a cage doing a life sentence.\u201d\n\nThe transcript of his last moments shows Berget joked about a several-hour delay to his execution.

Naftagaz refuses to resume supplies to local utility companies and power stations until they clear their debts or pay for supplies in advance.\n\nUkrainian Prime Minister Volodymyr Groisman on Wednesday laid the blame on local officials for failing to resolve the disputes, and said the parliament should consider firing them.\n\n\u201cThis has to be stopped,\u201d he told a televised session of the government. \u201cIf some mayors cannot make it work, we will be asking the parliament to deal with it and suspend them from their positions.\u201d\n\nGroisman said he has intervened and spent the past 24 hours, trying to bring about a settlement between local officials and the gas supplier.\n\nVolodymyr Mykolayenko, mayor of Kherson, where more than 100,000 people are believed to be without heating, told the 112 television station later Wednesday that thanks to Groisman\u2019s efforts the local power station has just started receiving gas and that the heating will come on in the coming hours.\n\nUkraine is struggling with a flagging economy and a separatist conflict in the east, which is weighing down on the nation\u2019s finances. One of the conditions for the International Monetary Fund to continue providing Ukraine with loans was that it should increase gas prices by 23 percent starting Nov. 1. Bills for hot water and heating are expected to increase by another 15 percent on Dec. 1.\n\nAngry Ukrainians have been rallying on the streets and blocking roads to protest the authorities\u2019 inaction.

Macy's Inc. reports earnings Wednesday, Nov. 14. (AP Photo/Mary Altaffer, File)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Macy\u2019s is heading into the crucial holiday season firing on all cylinders, logging its fourth consecutive quarter of sales growth at existing locations and getting strong reactions from customers both online and in its stores.\n\nThe company also lifted its expectations for annual earnings on Wednesday.\n\nDepartment stores like Macy\u2019s are under intense pressure to reinvent themselves with so many shoppers migrating online or just spending money elsewhere, choosing to be pampered at a spa or traveling.\n\nFortunately, Macy\u2019s and other retailers are doing so in the midst of a strong job market and robust economy, giving them more breathing room with shoppers feeling confident about splurging once in a while.\n\nMacy\u2019s, along with other stores, also have benefited from the misfortunes of others. Toys R Us and Bon-Ton have liquidated. Sears Holdings Corp., which operates Sears and Kmart stores, filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy last month. And J.C. Penney is floundering. Macy\u2019s says it\u2019s seeing increased business in the Midwest where Bon-Ton used to operate and it\u2019s aggressively courting its customers.\n\nBut Macy\u2019s focus is solidly on Macy\u2019s. It\u2019s been expanding its store label brands to differentiate itself from rivals. It\u2019s also adding more of its off-price Backstage stores and putting into place technology that allows customers to skip the line at the register.\n\nIt\u2019s rolling out multiple layers of technology to offer people something they can\u2019t get online, such as the use of virtual reality in its furniture and cosmetics sections. The company\u2019s revamped loyalty card program has helped keep its best customers engaged.\n\nAnd it\u2019s trying to become more nimble. Macy\u2019s acquired Story, a concept store, which rotates themes and what it sells every few months. It brought Story founder Rachel Shechtman aboard to help create a more vibrant shopping experience at Macy\u2019s.\n\nAnd in a more radical maneuver, the company is shrinking in order to grow.\n\nAfter closing more than 100 stores over the past several years, it\u2019s going to see how cluster of smaller stores work with today\u2019s customers.\n\nThe company released details of the new footprint to the Wall Street Journal earlier this week.\n\nCEO Jeff Gennette told industry analysts Wednesday that it\u2019s testing four different models for the new \u201cneighborhood stores\u201d format and promised to share details early next year.\n\n\u201cMacy\u2019s recipe for success is e-commerce, healthy stores and a great mobile experience that ties it all together,\u201d Gennette said, noting that the department store will hit a billion dollars in mobile sales this year.\n\nIt\u2019s still early, but industry watchers believe Macy\u2019s is on the right track in this altered retail landscape.\n\nNeil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, said consumer tracking data supports the story of an ongoing recovery.\n\nAt this time last year, 59 percent of Macy\u2019s customers rated their shopping experience as good or very good, Saunders said, based on its research. This year that figure has risen to 67 percent, Saunders said. He wrote that his data also show that for the first time in over eight years, the number of people saying they will visit Macy\u2019s to do holiday shopping has risen.\n\n\u201cAlong with the good sales numbers, these pieces of evidence underline that Macy\u2019s is succeeding in creating a stronger appeal,\u201d he wrote.\n\nMacy\u2019s Inc. reported third-quarter profits of $62 million, or 20 cents per share. Per-share earnings adjusted for one-time gains and losses were 27 cents, or 13 cents better than industry analyst expected, according to a survey by Zacks Investment Research.\n\nThe Cincinnati chain\u2019s revenue of $5.4 billion also beat expectations.\n\nSales at stores opened at least a year rose 3.3 percent, its fourth straight quarter of gains after a three-year slump. The figure included sales from its licensed departments.\n\nMacy\u2019s now expects annual profits to increase from $3.95 and $4.15 per share, to between $4.10 and $4.30.\n\nMacy\u2019s kicked off the earnings season for department stores.

(Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund via AP)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 There are more gorillas in the mist \u2014 a rare conservation success story, scientists say.\n\nAfter facing near-extinction, mountain gorillas are slowly rebounding. On Wednesday, the Switzerland-based International Union for Conservation of Nature updated mountain gorillas\u2019 status from \u201ccritically endangered\u201d to \u201cendangered,\u201d a more promising, if still precarious, designation. There are now just over 1,000 of the animals in the wild, up from an estimated population of 680 a decade ago.\n\n\u201cIn the context of crashing populations of wildlife around the world, this is a remarkable conservation success,\u201d said Tara Stoinski, president and chief scientist of the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund.\n\nThe Atlanta-based nonprofit is named for the primate researcher whose work helped draw international attention to mountain gorillas and whose memoir became the basis for the 1988 Sigourney Weaver film \u201cGorillas in the Mist.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a beacon of hope \u2014 and it\u2019s happened in recently war-torn and still very poor countries,\u201d said Stoinski, who is also a member of the IUCN\u2019s primate specialist group, which recommended the status change.\n\nMountain gorillas live in lush and misty forests along a range of dormant volcanoes in east Africa. Their habitat falls inside national parks spanning parts of Rwanda, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\n\nFossey, who died in 1985, had projected that the primates may be extinct by 2000. Instead, their populations have been slowly increasing thanks to sustained and well-funded international conservation efforts.\n\n\u201cWe have made progress in terms of their protection, in terms of allowing an environment where mountain gorillas can continue to thrive and grow,\u201d said Anna Behm Masozera, director of the International Gorilla Conservation Program, based in Kigali, Rwanda. \u201cBut it\u2019s important to note that mountain gorillas\u2019 numbers could still slip back very quickly. We still have just two fragile and small populations,\u201d split between two national park areas.\n\nSeveral factors have enabled mountain gorillas\u2019 modest rebound, said Masozera.\n\nThe three governments have stepped up enforcement of national park boundaries \u2014 areas where hunting, logging and paved roads are illegal.\n\nTourism helps too: Visitors pay up to $1,500 an hour to watch gorillas, money that helps pay for park rangers.\n\n\u201cPrimate ecotourism, done right, can be a really significant force for funding conservation,\u201d said Russ Mittermeier, chief conservation officer at Global Wildlife Conservation. \u201cIt gives local governments and communities a tangible economic incentive to protect these habitats and species.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also health care. Gorilla Doctors, a nongovernmental group, has trained veterinary staff in each of the countries where the mountain gorillas live.\n\nHunting in the national parks is illegal, but nearby residents still set traps to catch other animals, such as antelopes. Those traps can also grab gorillas\u2019 arms and legs.\n\nWhen gorillas are found struggling with snares, the vets are called in to clean wounds. Kirsten Gilardi, U.S. director for the organization, called it \u201cextreme conservation.\u201d\n\nOther experts said the emergency vet interventions play a significant role in maintaining mountain gorilla populations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a total conservation win, and there aren\u2019t that many of them,\u201d said Gilardi.\n\nOn Wednesday, the IUCN also announced that bans on commercial whaling in the North Pacific Ocean and elsewhere had allowed some whale populations to rebound. The fin whale\u2019s status was updated from \u201cendangered\u201d to \u201cvulnerable,\u201d a less critical designation.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

Likewise, the Meadowlands Racetrack in East Rutherford, just outside New York City, opened a full-scale sports book with FanDuel when it began operating in July, and Monmouth Park Racetrack in Oceanport built a sports betting lounge in a room just off the track\u2019s main betting area.\n\nSince New Jersey began taking sports bets in mid-June, over $336 million has been wagered on sports here.\n\n\u201cIt is critical that DraftKings\u2019 offering is the best-of-breed in both digital and physical sports book,\u201d said company co-founder Matt Kalish. \u201cBoth are very large markets within the legal, regulated sports book industry.\u201d\n\nThe push for physical sports books has cost millions of dollars and created hundreds of temporary construction jobs. Mark Giannantonio, president of Resorts, said 150 workers have been building the DraftKings sports book for 2 \u00bd months at a cost of several million dollars.\n\n\u201cWe have just one mission \u2014 to make sure we are first in this market,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are going to perform at a really high level.\u201d\n\nResorts and DraftKings, the daily fantasy sports company and recently minted bookmaker, have partnered for online sports betting since August.\n\nThe new sports books are designed to be much more than a place to watch a game, order a beer and make a bet. The most ambitious of them feature walls of gigantic video screens showing multiple games, plush leather chairs with cellphone chargers, and VIP areas with bottle service.\n\nThe Resorts facility will offer not just hot dogs and chicken wings, but short rib empanadas, chipotle quesadillas, and jalapeno cheddar fries.

Mobile County Sheriff\u2019s Office Detective J.T.
