(AP) \u2014 Marquez Callaway returned a punt for a touchdown and Tennessee\u2019s defense nearly pitched a shutout as the Vols defeated Charlotte 14-3 in their final nonconference game of the season Saturday.\n\nIn the first meeting between the programs, Tennessee (4-5) kept its bowl hopes alive while snapping a two-game losing streak in front of a paltry announced homecoming crowd of 86,753 at Neyland Stadium.\n\nIf Tennessee was hoping for a confidence-boosting offensive performance against a non-Power 5 opponent, the Vols didn\u2019t find it against Charlotte (4-5).\n\nThe Vols were limited to just 192 total yards and held scoreless through the final three quarters in equaling their season-low in points scored.\n\nCharlotte entered the game ranked sixth in the FBS in rushing defense (88.9 yards), and improved its standing. The 49ers held the Vols to only 20 net rushing yards on 26 attempts for a 0.8 average per rush.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t make any explosive plays and we really struggled to be consistent running the football. That is not a good recipe for success,\u201d Tennessee head coach Jeremy Pruitt said. \u201cWe did find a way to create a positive play on special teams and that probably was the difference in the ball game really.\u201d\n\nCallaway\u2019s punt return sparked the offense early. The junior wide receiver sprinted a career-high 82 yards for a touchdown to give the Vols a 7-0 lead in the first quarter. It was Callaway\u2019s second career punt return for a touchdown.\n\nUT quarterback Jarrett Guarantano found Josh Palmer for a 16-yard touchdown pass to increase the lead to 14-0. The 14 points were the most UT has scored in the first quarter this season.\n\nBut the early production wasn\u2019t a sign of things to come as the Vols offense bogged down for the remainder of the game. UT had only 93 yards of total offense in the first half, including 0 rushing yards. Until UT\u2019s final offensive drive in the fourth quarter, the Vols were in negative rushing yardage.\n\n\u201cI really thought we were able to control the line of scrimmage. I really wasn\u2019t sure of that coming into the game. Our guys up front played really well, and I was really proud of the tackling in the open field,\u201d Charlotte head coach Brad Lambert said. \u201cThat is thing you worry about playing against an SEC team. I thought they tackled well and did a nice job getting them behind the chains.\u201d\n\nUT\u2019s defense kept Charlotte from posing a serious threat for a comeback. The Vols recorded three sacks in the second half, and a fourth-down stop late in the fourth quarter secured the victory.\n\nGuarantano completed 16 of 21 passes for 172 yards. Palmer had four catches for 71 yards. UT tight end Dominick Wood-Anderson had career highs in catches (3) and yards (53).\n\nCharlotte quarterback Evan Shirreffs completed 13 of 25 passes for 152 yards and threw an interception in the final minute. Charlotte\u2019s Benny LeMay rushed 24 times for 81 yards.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nTennessee: It wasn\u2019t pretty, but the Vols did what was expected by beating their third non-Power 5 opponent this season. UT has won 30 straight against non-Power 5 opponents. But the Vols won\u2019t be happy with the lackluster performance on both sides of the ball. They will need to bring more energy as they return to SEC play next weekend for the final three games of the regular season.\n\nCharlotte: The 49ers are still searching for their first win over a Power 5 opponent. Charlotte fell to 0-4 all-time against Power 5 programs, including 0-2 against SEC opponents. But the 49ers can take some confidence from their defensive performance. They\u2019ve held four straight opponents to 21 points or fewer.

(AP Photo/Chris Seward)\n\nRALEIGH, N.C. (AP) \u2014 North Carolina State corrected many of the problems that had plagued the Wolfpack during two straight losses, namely by getting off to a fast start and running the ball well.\n\nAs for Florida State, there was no such strong response \u2014 only a second straight lopsided loss that inched the Seminoles closer to the end of decades-long streaks of success.\n\nFreshman Ricky Person Jr. scored three touchdowns while Jakobi Meyers had a big receiving day to help the Wolfpack beat the Seminoles 47-28 on Saturday, making the Wolfpack bowl eligible for the fifth straight year.\n\nMeyers had nine catches for 125 yards and a score for the Wolfpack (6-2, 3-2 Atlantic Coast Conference), who scored the first 17 points and never looked back in a one-sided show.\n\n\u201cI just thought it was really good execution in a lot of ways,\u201d Wolfpack coach Dave Doeren said.\n\nDoeren was right. The Wolfpack moved the chains against the nation\u2019s 12th-ranked run defense (102.9 yards), avoided major mistakes and got reliable kicking production when drives stalled.\n\nNot that there were many, considering N.C. State had a season-high scoring output.\n\nThe ground game certainly stood out. Person scored on 1- and 4-yard runs in the first half after missing last week\u2019s loss at No. 22 Syracuse due to injury. And Reggie Gallaspy II ran for a career-best 106 yards, part of a 177-yard output that surpassed the combined total from the losses to No. 2 Clemson followed by the Orange (172).\n\n\u201cIt makes just everything a lot more fun, to be honest, as an offensive lineman,\u201d Wolfpack center Garrett Bradbury said. \u201cWhen you can just at will drive down the field running the ball, and they know it\u2019s coming most of the time, it\u2019s just a good feeling.\u201d\n\nFSU\u2019s James Blackman threw for a career-high 421 yards and four scores in starting for Deondre Francois, with two going to Tamorrion Terry. But it didn\u2019t stop the Seminoles (4-5, 2-5) from taking a fourth loss by at least 19 points this year.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to learn to translate our effort and the way we work the sidelines to the football field,\u201d first-year FSU coach Willie Taggart said. \u201cThat\u2019s something we didn\u2019t do.\u201d\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nFSU: Things couldn\u2019t have been worse in last week\u2019s 59-10 home loss to No. 2 Clemson, a performance that had Taggart openly questioning his team\u2019s effort and whether some players quit. The Seminoles didn\u2019t play anywhere near well enough to win this one, either, including 16 penalties for 121 yards to continue their trend of being among the nation\u2019s most frequently flagged teams.\n\n\u201cI love this football team, I love our guys,\u201d Taggart said. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to do the things we\u2019re asking them to do. ... Our guys know how to play football. We\u2019ve got to teach them how to win now.\u201d\n\nN.C. State: Put simply, it was a clean performance. The Wolfpack avoided turnovers, allowed no sacks, committed just two penalties through the first three quarters and answered any FSU push. Getting the 17-0 lead was big, too, after falling behind 14-0 at Clemson and 24-7 at Syracuse in the first quarter.\n\n\u201cI feel like we have the ability to bounce back after two losses and keep going,\u201d Meyers said. \u201cIn the past once we lost to Clemson it was a real downfall for the rest of the season. But I think this team is special.\u201d\n\nSTREAK WATCH\n\nFlorida State\u2019s long streaks of winning seasons and bowl appearances are in serious jeopardy.\n\nFSU hasn\u2019t had a losing season since 1976 and has been in a bowl game for 36 straight seasons, with the last bowl-less season coming in 1981. The Seminoles have to win two of their last three \u2014 all against AP Top 25 teams \u2014 to become bowl eligible.\n\nPERSON\u2019S DAY\n\nPerson, who provides a big-play complement to Gallaspy\u2019s power in the run game, ran for 42 yards and capped his day with a short TD catch from Ryan Finley to make it 44-21 with 11:10 left.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nFSU: The Seminoles visit No. 3 Notre Dame next Saturday.\n\nN.C.

This game was decided long before the ball was kicked off.\u201d\n\nLock, a senior and projected first-round draft pick, was equally effective against Florida in a 45-16 victory last year. He will head to the NFL with six touchdowns passes and an interception in his final two games against the Gators.\n\n\u201cThis feels really good,\u201d Lock said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to put into words. It was a different week for us. You kind of had that feeling there\u2019s no way you lose that football game (to Kentucky). I think after a loss like that, there\u2019s no way you can go in and lose a game.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way I can feel any worse than I did last Saturday, so I wasn\u2019t going to let that happen again. And none of these guys were going to let that happen.

But the match turned scrappy and Ireland didn\u2019t score for half an hour.

(Matt Gentry/The Roanoke Times via AP)\n\nBLACKSBURG, Va. (AP) \u2014 Travis Levy went from a lightly used backup to the focal point of No. 24 Boston College\u2019s run-first offense, and he responded by running the Eagles into one of their biggest games in years.\n\nTaking over after star AJ Dillon tweaked an ankle injury, Levy for ran 75 yards and two touchdowns as Boston College beat Virginia Tech 31-21, setting them up for a huge home game against No. 2 Clemson next week.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m ready every game,\u201d the sophomore said. He started the day with just 29 carries for 102 yards with no touchdowns in the first eight games. \u201cNext man up mentality. That\u2019s what it is.\u201d\n\nDillon added 96 yards and a touchdown for BC (7-2, 4-1 Atlantic Coast Conference, No. 22 CFP), which will face the Tigers with first place in the ACC\u2019s Atlantic Division on the line.\n\n\u201cWe have an opportunity to play the No. 2 team in the country that\u2019s playing lights out football,\u201d BC coach Steve Addazio said.\n\nThe Eagles looked pretty good in their tuneup, limiting the Hokies to 32 yards in the third quarter and erasing a 14-7 deficit with 21 unanswered points after halftime.\n\n\u201cThe second half, everyone felt the energy throughout the locker room,\u201d said BC\u2019s Brandon Sebastian, who had a key interception. \u201cWe just kept swinging and stayed in there and put them away.\u201d\n\nRyan Willis threw for 281 yards with three touchdown passes for Virginia Tech (4-4, 3-2), but the Hokies lost their third straight at home for the first time since 1992. It came on a day when they could have moved into a share of first place in the Coastal Division with a victory.\n\nLevy scored on a 29-yard run midway through the third quarter to tie the game at 14, and his 1-yard run with 8:51 to play made it 28-14. In between, Anthony Brown got them the lead with a 22-yard TD pass to Korab Idrizi after an interception by Sebastian.\n\nOn the interception, Willis hit Damon Hazleton but the ball went off the receiver and right into the hands of Sebastian.\n\nWillis completed 25 of 42 passes and ran for 49 more yards. His touchdowns \u2014 26 yards to Hazleton, 4 yards to Eric Kumah and 14 yards to Tre Turner \u2014 all came when he threw the ball in their direction in one-on-one coverage. But the Hokies gained just 111 yards on 36 carries.\n\n\u201cIn this game, if you can only do one thing, they won\u2019t let you do that for very long,\u201d coach Justin Fuente said.\n\nBoth quarterbacks missed on what could have been long scoring passes. Brown had Michael Walker well behind the secondary but overthrew him on what would have been a 90-yard play in the second quarter, and Willis underthrew Turner in the middle of the field on a would-be 79-yard scoring play in the third quarter.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nBoston College: The Eagles\u2019 play-calling was curious at times. Dillon ran for three and then 17 yards on their first two plays, but three consecutive pass plays that followed yielded only a yard and a punt. Dillon carried seven times \u2014 half his first-half total \u2014 on their lone scoring drive before halftime.\n\nVirginia Tech: The Hokies already inexperienced defense has been worn thin by injuries. They began the day with leading tackler Rayshard Ashby dressed but not playing, nose tackle Jarrod Hewitt and OLB Dylan Rivers also sitting out with injuries and No. 2 tackler, LB Khalil Ladler, missing the first half because of a targeting call. They then lost cornerback Bryce Watts to a broken forearm and backup nose tackle Xavier Burke to an Achilles injury.\n\nEASY, TIGER\n\nAddazio had an amusing answer when asked if he\u2019s seen how Clemson fared earlier in the day. They beat Louisville 77-16.\n\n\u201cI did see it flash up on the board,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it was 77? You just want to ruin my night. Can I enjoy this game, maybe get on the plane and have one of those awful sandwiches, just feel good for a few minutes?\u201d\n\nUP NEXT\n\nThe Eagles return home, maybe to host ESPN\u2019s \u201cCollege GameDay.\u201d\n\nVirginia Tech heads onto the road to face Pittsburgh still with a chance in the Coastal Division matchup.\n\n___\n\nFollow Hank on Twitter: www.twitter.com/hankkurzjr\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "ANN ARBOR, Mich.

It was Watson\u2019s second pick-6 of the season, joining Lance Dottin (1991) as the only players to do that twice in a year.\n\nThe Nittany Lions started banged-up quarterback Trace McSorley and he was 5 of 13 for 83 yards with an interception and a fumble. McSorley played with an injured right knee in last week\u2019s win against Iowa. He shared time and rotated with Stevens, who was 3 of 4 for 35 yards. Stevens scored on an 8-yard run late in the game.\n\n\u201cWhen (Stevens) threw the interception there, we felt like we needed to put Trace back in,\u201d Franklin said. \u201cObviously, you make the decision and you probably could\u2019ve made the change a little bit earlier.

They made it a nice, makeable field goal for me.\u201d\n\nThe big finish came exactly one week after Evans endured a nightmare at Michigan State.\n\nHe missed a 57-yarder at the end of the first half following a 5-yard penalty against the Boilermakers and had a 41-yard attempt to tie the game blocked late in the fourth quarter.\n\nThis time, Evans and the field goal unit were virtually flawless after quarterback David Blough marched the Boilermakers 43 yards and put the ball on the left hash mark for the decisive field goal.\n\nBlough was 23 of 32 with 333 yards, four touchdowns and two interceptions while hooking up with Terry Wright for three scores.\n\nBut it was Evans\u2019 kick that gave Purdue (6-2, 4-2) its third win over a ranked opponent this season, the first time the Boilermakers achieved that feat in 15 years, and within one game of division-leading Northwestern.\n\n\u201cGreat job by our field goal unit of protecting and great job by Spencer kicking it right dead middle,\u201d coach Jeff Brohm said.\n\nThe Hawkeyes (6-3, 3-3, No. 16 CFP) lost their second straight road game and another chance to celebrate coach Kirk Ferentz\u2019s 150th conference victory. Woody Hayes, Amos Alonzo Stagg, Bo Schembechler and Joe Paterno are the only Big Ten coaches in the exclusive club.\n\nNate Stanley threw for 275 yards with one TD and ran for another score but it was Iowa\u2019s vaunted defense that let down the Hawkeyes.\n\nIt was burned repeatedly for big plays and couldn\u2019t come up with one last stop after Purdue took over at the 50-yard line with 4:30 to play.\n\n\u201cThat was a really tough, tough loss for us to go through,\u201d Ferentz said. \u201cI think our team played extremely hard right to the finish. Not sure what more (the players) could have done.\u201d\n\nStopping Wright would have helped. He caught six passes for 146 yards and became the first Purdue receiver to catch three TD passes in a game since Gary Bush in 2012.\n\nStill, the defense gave the Hawkeyes a fighting chance.\n\nTrailing 35-23 after Wright\u2019s final score, a 3-yard TD catch, Mekhi Sargent scored on a 1-yard run to make it 35-30. Amani Hooker picked off Blough on the next offensive play and had a touchdown return called back because of holding.\n\nSargent wound up scoring on a 1-yard plunge a few minutes later to make it 36-30 with 10:19 to play after Iowa\u2019s second 2-point conversion failed.\n\nBut the Boilermakers took advantage of a 31-yard punt by methodically moving down the field, positioning Evans for the kick he and his coach had been dreaming about.\n\n\u201cWe had a kick blocked the last game that hurt us,\u201d Brohm said. \u201cWe found a way to make this one.\u201d\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nIowa: After watching their playoff aspirations vanish with last week\u2019s loss at Penn State, the Hawkeyes\u2019 Big Ten title hopes have now likely faded away, too.\n\nPurdue: The Boilermakers are 3-1 against ranked teams this season, but there\u2019s plenty still at stake with two winnable road games and a home date against Wisconsin left on the schedule.\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\n\nIowa: Probably will fall out of the Top 25 after losing in back-to-back weeks by a total of eight points.\n\nPurdue: Another win over a Top 25 foe should turn some heads but probably won\u2019t make a strong enough case to get the Boilermakers back into the Top 25.\n\nSTATISTICALLY SPEAKING\n\nIowa: Stanley moved into the top 10 on the school\u2019s career list in yards passing, surpassing Kyle McCann.

Swift ran for a career-high 156 yards and two touchdowns as the sixth-ranked Bulldogs defeated No. 11 Kentucky 34-17 to clinch the SEC East title.\n\n\u201cI think people had started doubting us,\u201d Swift said. \u201cWe just tried to silence the critics.\u201d\n\nGeorgia RB D\u2019Andre Swift says the Bulldogs wanted to silence their critics Saturday. pic.twitter.com/BESMQuCfGH \u2014 Steve Megargee (@stevemegargee) November 4, 2018\n\nSwift had an 83-yard breakaway in the third quarter that gave Georgia (8-1, 6-1, No. 6 College Football Playoff) a 28-3 lead. He also had a nifty 20-yard scoring run in the second period when the game was close.\n\nHolyfield ran for a career-high 115 yards on 18 carries, scoring on a 4-yarder in the third quarter. Georgia rushed for a season-high 331 yards to earn a spot in the SEC championship game Dec. 1 in Atlanta.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a point proven,\u201d Holyfield said. \u201cThere was a lot of talk about them.... and not enough talk about us.\u201d\n\nKentucky (7-2, 5-2, No. 9 CFP) has never reached the SEC championship game, which has been played every year since 1992. The Wildcats entered the weekend with the nation\u2019s top scoring defense and hadn\u2019t allowed anyone to exceed 20 points all year, but they couldn\u2019t slow down Georgia\u2019s tandem of Swift and Holyfield.\n\nBefore Saturday\u2019s game, the only player to rush for as many as 75 yards against Kentucky was Texas A&M\u2019s Trayveon Williams, who ran for 138 yards in a 20-14 overtime victory over the Wildcats. Swift and Holyfield were both over the 100-yard mark by the end of the third quarter.\n\n\u201cThey did a good job,\u201d Kentucky coach Mark Stoops said. \u201cThey moved us. They made us miss. There\u2019s a lot of things we could have done better, but a lot of that has to do with them.\u201d\n\nKentucky dominated time of possession through the first 1 1/2 quarters, but still trailed 7-3. That\u2019s when Swift started to give the Bulldogs some breathing room.\n\nWith Georgia facing second-and-17, Swift made a move around a defender at the line of scrimmage, made another move between two Wildcats about five yards downfield and shed a tackle inside the 5 to complete a remarkable 20-yard touchdown run.\n\nSwift\u2019s touchdown gave Georgia a 14-3 late in the second quarter. Georgia fumbled away a scoring opportunity late in the first half but got the ball to open the second half and extended the lead to 21-3 on Holyfield\u2019s touchdown.\n\nOn Georgia\u2019s next series, Swift raced through a big hole on the left side of the line and didn\u2019t appear to get touched on his 83-yard sprint to the end zone. Before that play, Kentucky hadn\u2019t allowed a run from scrimmage longer than 34 yards all season.\n\n*looks up the definition of swift* pic.twitter.com/HfiP5INqvK \u2014 CBS Sports (@CBSSports) November 3, 2018\n\nThat touchdown sealed a hard-earned division title for Georgia, last year\u2019s College Football Playoff runner-up. After losing 36-16 at LSU two weeks ago, Georgia beat Florida and Kentucky for two straight wins over ranked division foes.\n\n\u201cGive our kids a lot of credit because their backs were against the wall kind of two weeks in a row and they came out fighting,\u201d Georgia coach Kirby Smart said. \u201cThey came out scratching and clawing.\u201d\n\nGeorgia coach Kirby Smart discusses what it means to win a second straight SEC East title pic.twitter.com/3mu3Aj7E5O \u2014 Steve Megargee (@stevemegargee) November 4, 2018\n\nTAKEAWAYS\n\nGeorgia: The Bulldogs\u2019 fearsome rushing attack was the difference in the game, but Georgia\u2019s pass rush also started showing signs of life. Georgia had four sacks Saturday after entering the weekend with an SEC-low 10 sacks all season. Georgia now won\u2019t have to play another true road game all season. The Bulldogs have home games with Auburn, Massachusetts and Georgia Tech the next three weeks.\n\nKentucky: The Wildcats reached Georgia territory on three straight first-half possessions and only had three points to show for it. That proved critical when a defense that had carried Kentucky all season couldn\u2019t slow down Georgia\u2019s rushing attack. Kentucky got more bad news in the third quarter when safety Darius West drew a targeting penalty that will knock him out for the first half of its game next week at Tennessee.\n\nSLOWING SNELL\n\nSnell ran for 73 yards and one touchdown for the Wildcats to increase his season total to 1,008, becoming the first Kentucky player to rush for 1,000 yards in three seasons. But he needed 20 carries to reach that total, an average of 3.65 yards per attempt.\n\n\u201cPeople doubt us and say we can\u2019t do this and we can\u2019t do that,\u201d Georgia defensive end Jonathan Ledbetter said. \u201cWe\u2019ll just do what we do. When they realize that\u2019s what we do, we\u2019ll just keep pushing.\u201d\n\nGeorgia DE Jonathan Ledbetter discusses the defense\u2019s motivation. pic.twitter.com/1cOe4D6lz4 \u2014 Steve Megargee (@stevemegargee) November 4, 2018\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\n\nGeorgia may need some help to get up to the top five, though this victory likely assures the Bulldogs remain in control of their postseason fate.

(AP) \u2014 Even if he isn\u2019t recognized as this year\u2019s top thoroughbred, Accelerate all but assured his place as North America\u2019s best older horse.\n\nHis signature win in the Breeders\u2019 Cup Classic should solidify his credentials for multiple honors.\n\nAccelerate took the lead at the top of the stretch and held off Gunnevera to win the $6 million Classic by a length Saturday, strengthening his bid for Horse of the Year over Triple Crown winner Justify.\n\nThe race lacked the retired 3-year-old star and left a wide-open field, which the 5-year-old chestnut horse eventually overtook after breaking from the No. 14 post as the favorite. Accelerate made a sweeping move in the far turn and was in charge at the top of the stretch, then held off Gunnevera for his fifth consecutive Grade 1 victory and sixth of seven overall this year.\n\nThat gave trainer John Sadler his first Breeders\u2019 Cup win since his initial starter 30 years ago.\n\nAs for the California-based Accelerate being named this year\u2019s top thoroughbred, Sadler said he\u2019d leave that up to media who vote on the Eclipse Awards. He noted his own bias, though.\n\n\u201cTo me, he\u2019s the Horse of the Year, no doubt,\u201d Sadler said. \u201cHe\u2019s won all those great races. To win the Santa Anita Handicap (in March) was for me probably one or two on my bucket list.\n\n\u201cThe Classic is a newer race but a great race, and he won that so smashingly. He\u2019s just a great horse and had a great year.\u201d\n\nRidden by Joel Rosario, Accelerate covered 1 1/4 miles in 2:02.93 and paid $7.40, $6 and $4.40.\n\n\u201cHe broke really well,\u201d Rosario said of Accelerate. \u201cI was on the outside and had to use him a little bit.

They finished seventh and 12th, respectively, after projections of challenging Accelerate in the marquee event of nine season-ending championship races.\n\n\u201cThey looked good for a mile,\u201d Baffert said. \u201cThey just tired and just didn\u2019t have it today.\u201d\n\nGunnevera, Thunder Snow and early pace setter Mendelssohn made things interesting before 70,423, an upside to the absence of horse racing\u2019s 13th Triple Crown winner from the Classic.

Oakland also has allowed opponents to have a 113.9 passer rating, a mark that only one team ever has been worse than over a full season.\n\nIrvin played just 24 snaps in Week 8 against Indianapolis and then just nine against the 49ers. Irvin\u2019s six games with his fewest snap counts since joining the Raiders in 2016 have come this year.

We haven\u2019t had the opposition behind in the chains a lot. So his role has been reduced. I know he\u2019s frustrated. I\u2019m frustrated. We\u2019ll try to solve that as soon as possible.

I also think it is short track racing,\u201d Logano said. \u201cAll of that was on the line at that point and I think we both understand that there was so much on the line and that is what happens sometimes.\u201d\n\nThe playoff chase has gone from the half-mile paperclip-shaped track at Martinsville to the high-speed 1 1/2-mile Texas layout where polesitter Ryan Blaney qualified at more than 200 mph, along with Bowyer.\n\nAfter Logano knocked him out of his first victory at a short track, Truex will try to get his first win at Texas, where he has 14 top-10 finishes and has led 595 laps \u2014 but never the last one.\n\n\u201cWe just haven\u2019t been very lucky here.

The first 85-lap stage earlier this year ended under caution after a front right tire blew on Truex\u2019s No. 78 Toyota, which shot up the track and slammed hard into the outer wall. Truex, second at the time, finished last in the 37-car field.\n\nTruex is tied with Harvick for third in the playoff standings, 25 points above the cutline with three spots still up for grabs.\n\nWhile trying to get one of those spots, Truex is going into the final three races with the Furniture Row team since the primary sponsor is leaving the one-car operation based in suburban Denver.\n\n\u201cHonestly I feel like we\u2019ve been so caught up in everything, and just so focused on trying to get back to Homestead and trying to repeat, we haven\u2019t really talked about it,\u201d Truex said. \u201cIt\u2019s inevitable, and it\u2019s not a perfect scenario, it\u2019s not what we all wanted, but I think everybody on the team has done an amazing job of focusing in on the right things and continue to perform at a high level.\u201d\n\nAnd contending for another championship.\n\nTruex has 19 top-10 finishes this season \u2014 all of those are top-fives.\n\n\u201cWe have zero finishes from sixth to 10th,\u201d Truex said. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of been our year. It\u2019s been either, we\u2019re in position to win, we\u2019ve run up front all day, or something really stupid happens, or crazy happens, like here in Texas. ...

Logistically, Qatar pulled off the 2018 world gymnastics championships largely without a hitch, yet the majority of the 10-day event was played in front of sparse crowds at the Aspire Dome. (AP Photo/Vadim Ghirda)\n\nDOHA, Qatar (AP) \u2014 All the usual bells and whistles were there. The pyrotechnic introductions. The in-house deejay heavy on American pop music. An aggressive social media campaign replete with its own hashtag (#GoGymtastic). The bright colors on the competition floor. Oh, and perhaps the greatest gymnast of all time at the height of her astonishing powers.\n\nOnly one thing seemed to be missing during the world championships\u2019 first visit to the Middle East: people.\n\nThe majority of the sessions during the 10-day meet that ended Saturday were held in front of significant swaths of empty blue and yellow seats at the Aspire Dome. Most of the audience wore pink lanyards with laminated ID cars attached, a clear giveaway that they weren\u2019t paying customers but members of one of the dozens of gymnastic federations who flocked to the desert for the sport\u2019s marquee event, one that at times seemed more like a convention than anything else.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really different,\u201d Simone Biles said after leading the U.S. women to gold in the team final in front of an arena that was half-filled at best. \u201cIt almost felt like it wasn\u2019t world championships out there because there\u2019s not a lot of people in the crowd and most of the crowd was made up of delegations. But it\u2019s so exciting to see the delegation out here supporting everyone in your own country.\u201d\n\nLogistically there were few hiccups, another small positive step for a country preparing to host the world track and field championships in 2019 and soccer\u2019s World Cup in 2022.\n\nThe buses ran on time and getting around in general wasn\u2019t a problem in a place where an Uber could be found. Save for a handful of brief downpours \u2014 including one that flooded one of the training gyms and another that led to a brief power outage on the floor during women\u2019s qualifying, the weather cooperated too, with temperatures in the mid-80s.\n\nConcerns about how the culture of a sport that preaches openness would be received in a conservative Muslim country evaporated quickly. The proof lay next door at a massive shopping mall, where many of the gymnasts spent their down time walking around in shorts and T-shirts alongside Qataris in culturally traditional attire.\n\nAnd yet four years of meticulous preparations by the local organizing committee did little to spark widespread interest in a sport that\u2019s still trying to gain a foothold in the region.\n\nMinutes before the women\u2019s team final Tuesday, Americans Anne Josephson, Nicole Caggiano and Tina Ferriola \u2014 all of whom own gyms in the U.S. \u2014 and Matt Goldsmith walked along a sparse concourse before what is typically the biggest night of every world championships. They marveled at how many good seats were still available, the gymnastics equivalent of the Golden State Warriors winning an NBA title in front of friends and family and little else.\n\n\u201cThere are more people in my gym on a Wednesday morning taking \u2018Mommy and Me\u2019 classes than there are in here right now and it\u2019s really sad,\u201d said Josephson, who runs Jag Gym in Culver City, California.\n\nJosephson read the U.S. State Department report on Qatar before her group purchased tickets and wasn\u2019t worried about safety, though she pointed out she chose to wear black pants despite the heat because she wanted to \u201cfollow the rules.\u201d\n\nWhile they anticipated an environment that wasn\u2019t quite as frenzied as what they experienced at the 2017 worlds in Montreal last year \u2014 when thousands of Canadians flocked to Olympic Stadium \u2014 they were struck by the lack of buzz inside the arena, which had a capacity of about 2,500 for the event.\n\n\u201cWhat an experience that we\u2019re about to have, all 60 of us together,\u201d Ferriola said. \u201cNow we all are like good friends because this is a very intimate experience.\u201d\n\nOrganizers did what they could to engage younger Qataris, holding demonstrations in the run-up to the meet and using multiple social media platforms to provide a close look at the athletes. They gave away tickets to local schools and on the day of the men\u2019s all-around final offered 50 percent off for adults and allowed children under 10 to get in free. And still the stands were nowhere close to full.\n\nSave for a couple of storefront banners close to the massive Aspire Zone \u2014 the sprawling complex in the western suburbs that served as the host of the 2006 Asian Games \u2014 and the random bus, there was little proof Biles was chasing history. Meanwhile, signs promoting a professional squash tournament lined lampposts that ran down the median of Al Corniche Street in front of the city\u2019s signature downtown skyline.\n\n\u201cWe are still building a sporting culture in our region, this cannot be done overnight,\u201d Ali Al-Hitmi, CEO of the local organizers wrote in an email to The Associated Press. \u201cWe have seen the numbers in the crowd grow each day over the course of the 10-day event. The atmosphere itself has swept across our country and word of mouth has seen many ticket purchases on the door at Aspire Dome.\u201d\n\nThe International Gymnastics Federation praised the Qatar for its effort and said it had received \u201cno major complaints\u201d from the delegations, though the federation expressed concern about the lackluster numbers \u2014 particularly early on\u2014 and placed the blame on a competition schedule designed to appease TV rights holders across the globe.\n\nThe team, all-around and event finals all began at 4 p.m. local time, the height of rush hour in a city of over a million people. Many families head home for evening prayer immediately after work or school, making getting to a two-hour meet difficult. Attendance did perk up during the event finals, which were held on Friday and Saturday, the weekend in Qatar.\n\nAmerican Morgan Hurd felt an uptick in the energy while competing in the floor exercise finals on Saturday but also allowed she received a boost because she could hear Biles shouting out her support, something that\u2019s typically difficult to pick out when music is blaring and the stands are packed.\n\nThe world championships head to Stuttgart, Germany, next October, and ticket sales are brisk. Qatar, meanwhile, will move forward in preparations for track\u2019s visit to Khalifa International Stadium, across the street from the Aspire Dome.\n\nOrganizers aren\u2019t concerned about the somewhat unenthusiastic response to gymnastics having a negative impact in terms of drawing fans \u2014 particularly Westerners \u2014 to a country that\u2019s hoping to use sports to help expand its global footprint.\n\n\u201cWe have no doubt that the venue will be full,\u201d Sheikh Asma Al Thani, director of marketing and communications for the 2019 world track championships wrote in an email. \u201cWe are working with many different stakeholders to ensure we can bring in as many international and local fans to the championship, offering them a cultural and sporting experience like no other.\u201d\n\nMaybe, but the country that promises to \u201cDeliver Amazing\u201d when the World Cup arrives in four years could have its work cut out delivering something else.\n\nEnough people to watch.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sport and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "U.S. Sen.

Chambers converted a pair of third downs during the drive.\n\n\u201cCertainly with the conditions, the wind and snow, it turned it into a game that we needed to leverage our running ability,\u201d said Wyoming coach Craig Bohl, whose team rushed 64 times and passed only eight. \u201cIt ate up time off the clock, kept our defense fresh and had a big impact on the game.\u201d\n\nEvans, who had his third-best rushing day, moved from 13th to sixth on Wyoming\u2019s single-season rushing list and with two games to go, the senior has 1,166 yards. He needs 135 to catch No. 5 Devin Moore, who had 1,301 yards in 2008.\n\nWyoming guard Kayden Jackson said Chambers \u201cruns the ball hard (and is) not afraid to lower his shoulder, and if you have a quarterback that can do that, you better look out.\u201d\n\nBlocking for Evans, Jackson said, is \u201cawesome.\u201d\n\n\u201cNico runs hard, finds seams in the gaps and if we don\u2019t quite get the movement, he makes plays.\u201d\n\nWyoming\u2019s two long runs were the exception to a great battle on the line of scrimmage, according to Spartans nose tackle Boogie Roberts, who had eight tackles and a forced fumble.\n\n\u201cMan, we were fighting. It was a battle down in the trenches,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were giving some, we were giving some. And then two small plays, long runs. ... Just a shout-out to their O-line, and their running backs were running hard.\u201d\n\nSan Jose State coach Brent Brennan said Evans is \u201ca stud, an absolute stud,\u201d adding that his team\u2019s defense had two key breakdowns.\n\n\u201cWe were playing good defense, the one Chambers split in the second half ... seemed like he was running forever,\u201d Brennan said. \u201cAnd then the one by Evans in the first half was also a big play. We got out of a gap and that\u2019s what happens. When you make a mistake like that, the ball finds you.\u201d\n\nLove, who was hit often as he threw, was 19 of 32 passing for 173 yards for San Jose State (1-8, 1-4), while Tyler Nevens rushed for 70 yards on 17 attempts.\n\nFIELD GOAL STREAKS\n\nWyoming\u2019s Cooper Rothe kicked a 26-yard field goal to open the scoring but missed a 43-yarder, ending the nation\u2019s longest active FBS streak at 18, dating to last season. He is now 15 of 16 in 2018.\n\nSan Jose State\u2019s Bryce Crawford also converted a 26-yarder, his seventh straight successful attempt and 44th of his career, moving him into second place on the Spartans\u2019 career list.\n\nNOVEMBER AT 7,220 FEET\n\nThe temperature was 34 degrees at kickoff with gusts over 40 mph, yielding a 21-degree wind chill. The sun made a brief appearance early but light snow showers, driven by strong wind, swirled most of the afternoon. Meanwhile, 1,152 miles to the west, it was 80 degrees in San Jose.\n\n\u201cMan, that was the first time I\u2019ve ever seen snow in my life,\u201d said Roberts, a Los Angeles native. \u201cBut at the end of the day it\u2019s still football. It\u2019s still 11 guys on offense and 11 guys on defense.\u201d\n\nBrennan agreed the weather was not much of a factor.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019s kids in our locker room that didn\u2019t like playing in that. I\u2019m certain of it,\u201d he said. \u201cI was talking with Coach (Bohl) before the game. He said last year, Thanksgiving weekend, his players didn\u2019t like the 85 degrees in San Jose, California. Home field advantage is what home field advantage is.\u201d\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nSan Jose State: The Spartans were hoping to build off last week\u2019s 506-yard effort in a 50-37 win over UNLV, their first victory of the season, but the Cowboys\u2019 defense stifled the visitors\u2019 attack. San Jose State had only 39 yards and two first downs in the first half and didn\u2019t cross midfield until the third quarter. The Spartans finished with 244 yards.\n\nWyoming: The Cowboys remained in the hunt for bowl eligibility with their second straight conference win. With Chambers at the helm, the offense continues to improve, piling up a season-high 475 yards and finishing with a time-consuming drive to seal the win. The defense, led by Logan Wilson\u2019s 10 tackles, made key stops down the stretch and held the Spartans to their third-lowest yardage total of the year.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nSan Jose State: The Spartans visit Utah State next Saturday.

Given the stakes for his presidency, he might as well be.\n\nA knot of investigations. Partisan gridlock. A warning shot for his re-election bid. Trump faces potentially debilitating fallout should Republicans lose control of one or both chambers in Congress, ending two years of GOP hegemony in Washington. A White House that has struggled to stay on course under favorable circumstances would be tested in dramatic ways. A president who often battles his own party would face a far less forgiving opposition.\n\nOn the flip side, if Republicans maintain control of the House and Senate, that\u2019s not only a victory for the GOP but also a validation of Trump\u2019s brand of politics and his unconventional presidency. That result, considered less likely even within the White House, would embolden the president as he launches his own re-election bid.\n\nWhite House aides insist the president doesn\u2019t spend much time contemplating defeat, but he has begun to try to calibrate expectations. He has focused on the competitive Senate races in the final days of his scorched-earth campaign blitz, and he has distanced himself from blame should Republicans lose the House. If that happens, he intends to claim victory, arguing his efforts on the campaign trail narrowed GOP losses and helped them hold the Senate, according to a person familiar with Trump\u2019s thinking who was not authorized to discuss White House conversations by name and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nThroughout the campaign, Trump has been testing out other explanations \u2014 pointing to historical headwinds for the party of an incumbent president and complaining about a rash of GOP retirements this year. He told The Associated Press last month that he won\u2019t bear any responsibility should Democrats take over.\n\nAt a rally in West Virginia on Friday, a defiant Trump brushed off the prospect of a Democratic House takeover. \u201cIt could happen,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. I\u2019ll just figure it out.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, his staff has begun preparations to deal with a flood of subpoenas that could arrive next year from Democrat-controlled committees, and the White House counsel\u2019s office has been trying to attract seasoned lawyers to field oversight inquiries.\n\nShould they take the House, Democrats are already plotting to reopen the House intelligence committee\u2019s investigation into the Trump campaign\u2019s ties to Russia. Other committees are plotting aggressive oversight of Trump\u2019s administration and his web of business interests. Some Democrats are looking at using the House Ways and Means Committee to obtain copies of the president\u2019s tax returns after he broke with decades of tradition and withheld them from public scrutiny during his campaign for the White House.\n\nA slim Republican majority in the House would also present challenges, likely inflaming simmering intraparty disputes. First among them would be a potentially bitter leadership fight in the House to replace retiring Speaker Paul Ryan. But a narrowed majority would also exacerbate divisions over policy \u2014 and continued unified control could leave the GOP facing the blame for gridlock.\n\n\u201cClearly there\u2019s an awful lot on the line in terms of the legislative agenda,\u201d said Republican consultant Josh Holmes. \u201cThe prospect of a Democratic controlled House or Senate puts a serious wrinkle in getting anything through Congress.\u201d\n\nSome in the White House think losing to the Democrats might actually be preferable. They view Democrats\u2019 eagerness to investigate the president as a blessing in disguise in the run-up to 2020. They view House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi as a potent foil for Trump and believe they can tag the party responsible for Washington dysfunction.\n\nAri Fleischer, George W. Bush\u2019s press secretary, said Democratic control of the House \u201chas both peril and promise for the president.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe peril is subpoenas, investigations, legal bills and headaches,\u201d he said. \u201cThe promise is Trump will have an easy foil to run against: Pelosi and Democratic leadership.\u201d\n\nWhite House aides have discussed floating popular legislative issues, such as infrastructure, to tempt Democrats and test the unity of the Democratic opposition.\n\nWhile keeping the House remains an uphill battle for the GOP, Trump and Republicans have tried to sell voters on the possibility of another two years of GOP control. They promised hard-line immigration policies and more tax cuts, arguing that Democrats would erase two years of progress.\n\nIn the closing weeks of the midterms, Trump has unleashed a no-holds-barred effort to boost Republicans as he dipped into the same undercurrents of unease that defined his 2016 campaign \u2014 from stoking fears about illegal immigration to warning of economic collapse if Democrats are victorious.\n\nBut a House loss will prompt GOP hand-wringing about the divides in the party and the struggles for moderate Republicans to run in the Trump era, as well as raise questions about whether the Democratic gains point to a path for presidential hopefuls in 2020.\n\nDemocratic consultant Jim Manley said Tuesday may reveal if Democrats are having any success recapturing white working-class voters in the Midwest who backed Trump in 2016.\n\n\u201cTrump is helping. He\u2019s becoming more and more radioactive,\u201d Manley said. \u201cThere\u2019s a chance to try and win them back over.\u201d\n\nBut while the results may reveal weaknesses in the Republican coalition, midterm elections are very different than presidential years. Republicans were quick to point out that the party in power typically suffers defeats in midterms. Former President Barack Obama was, in his words, \u201cshellacked\u201d in 2010 and went on to win re-election in 2012.\n\nSaid Fleischer: \u201cIn the aftermath, people will exaggerate its meaning and in two years\u2019 time, everything will have changed.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "NEW CASTLE, Del.

The forest averages 15 to 20 fires per year.\n\nWildfires in southeast Alaska are not the hazard they are elsewhere in the state. The Tongass is the world\u2019s largest intact temperate rainforest. Ketchikan, near the southern end of the forest, bills itself as the Rain Capital of Alaska and receives upward of 150 inches (381 centimeters) of rain a year.\n\nTristan Fluharty, forest fire management officer for the Tongass, said warm, dry weather was behind the increase in 2018.\n\n\u201cWe really did spend a lot more time actually putting the fires out,\u201d Fluharty said.\n\nThe 32 fires together burned 63 acres (25.5 hectares). The largest fire, which occurred in fire in May and June near Berners Bay north of Juneau, burned more than 50 acres (20 hectares).\n\nA fire at Moser Bay near Ketchikan burned for several days and cost the Forest Service about $126,000 to fight.\n\nMost wildfires in the region are caused by humans, Fluharty said. Most of the 2018 fires were near the road system in Juneau, the region\u2019s biggest population center.\n\nThe Tongass\u2019 annual budget for fire preparedness is about $1 million, which pays for salaries, equipment, inventory, travel and training.

In 2004, 706 fires burned a record 6.7 million acres (2.7 million hectares) or 10,465 square miles (27,104 sq. kilometers).\n\nHowever, in 2018, the state saw just 360 fires that burned 411,591 acres (166,565 hectares) or 644 square miles (1,668 sq. kilometers).\n\n\u201cIn terms of Alaska fire years, it was well below average,\u201d Mowry said.\n\nThe southeast Alaska fire season occurred against a backdrop of worsening wildfires in the Lower 48. From 1985 to 2017, the total acreage burned in the U.S. each year has fluctuated but increased on average. Over those 22 years, federal fire suppression spending has increased tenfold to nearly $3 billion, according to data from the National Interagency Fire Center.\n\nFluharty has seen no clear evidence pointing toward an acceleration or lengthening of the fire season in southeast Alaska.", "Police say Iowa couple left baby home alone to go to bar\n\nURBANDALE, Iowa (AP) \u2014 A central Iowa couple face charges after police say they left their 9-month-old baby home alone to go to a bar.\n\nTelevision station KCCI reports that police arrested 22-year-old Bryan Austin McCrea Bozarth and 20-year-old Ashley Lee Routh King on Friday.

He expected the decision to clock the ball, but then got the signal for the last play that resulted in the game-winning score.\n\n\u201cWe were so close that we still would have had time to kick a field goal,\u201d Brewer said. \u201cAs a quarterback you have to be ready for anything.\u201d\n\nThe win gets Baylor (5-4, 3-3 Big 12) within one win of bowl eligibility, a year after winning only one game in Rhule\u2019s first season.\n\nOn Brewer\u2019s first drive, the Bears went 86 yards \u2014 aided by 30 yards of penalties against the Cowboys \u2014 and scored on a 36-yard TD pass to Jalen Hurd with 5:43 left.\n\nBaylor\u2019s game-winning drive started after Oklahoma State (5-4, 2-4) was stopped on fourth down, when Chris Miller sacked Taylor Cornelius for a 9-yard loss with 1:31 left.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re in fourth-and-3.

That leaves them one win shy of being bowl eligible for the 13th straight season, with road games against No. 7 Oklahoma and TCU, and a home tilt with No. 12 West Virginia left on the schedule. In addition to the blocked punt, Matt Ammendola had a 47-yard field goal blocked and was well short kicking a 45-yarder into a stiff breeze.\n\nBaylor: The Bears were winless at home last season but are 4-1 with only a reeling TCU team still set to come to McLane Stadium. They won despite coming up empty on their first two drives, both of which ended inside the Oklahoma State 10.

Patty Murray, D-Wash., center, following a pep talk with Murray to volunteers at Brown's campaign office in Spokane, Wash. (AP Photo/Ted S. Warren)\n\nSPOKANE, Wash. (AP) \u2014 In 1994, Democratic U.S. Rep. Tom Foley of eastern Washington state became the first House Speaker to lose an election bid since the Civil War. People in eastern Washington may be poised to oust another legislative leader this year.\n\nRepublican U.S. Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, who is fourth in House leadership and the highest-ranking woman in the GOP, faces a formidable challenge in the 5th Congressional District from Democrat Lisa Brown.\n\nIt is one of three U.S. House races in Washington state getting national attention as Democrats try to gain control of the chamber. Democrats also are mounting strong challenges for two other Republican-held districts - the 8th, which stretches from Seattle\u2019s eastern suburbs across the Cascade Mountains and the 3rd, in southwestern Washington.\n\nCongressional races in Washington state are usually predictable, with incumbents holding their seats with relative ease. Currently there are six Democrats and four Republicans in the state\u2019s House delegation.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s just a matter of everyone anticipating that 2018 would be a good year for Democrats,\u201d said Travis Ridout, a political science professor at Washington State University. \u201cA lot of high-quality Democratic candidates saw that they might have a good chance and decided to run this year.\u201d\n\nMcMorris Rodgers got 49 percent of the vote, to Brown\u2019s 45 percent, in August\u2019s primary election, in which the top two finishers advanced to November regardless of party. But the outcome, with McMorris Rodgers below 50 percent, was close enough that Brown brought in nearly double what McMorris Rodgers raised in campaign funding in the third quarter.\n\nMcMorris Rodgers has raised $5.49 million in total, while Brown has raised $5.29 million, as of the Oct. 17 reporting period.\n\nThe $10.7 million raised by the two campaigns is unprecedented in the district. Many negative TV ads brand Brown as a tax-and-spend liberal, and McMorris Rodgers as a career politician who is in lockstep with President Trump.\n\nMcMorris Rodgers believes the country is on the right path, with unemployment low and business confidence high.\n\n\u201cWhat a change to two years ago,\u201d she said during a recent debate. \u201cLet\u2019s not go back. Let\u2019s keep striving to a positive future.\u201d\n\nShe is the highest-ranking House Republican in a competitive race, and the contest is important as the Democrats seek to win control of the House. Plus, the district hasn\u2019t seen a close election since Foley lost.\n\nBrown contended the economy is not nearly as rosy as portrayed by Republicans, and that the district needs new leadership.\n\n\u201cEastern Washington is ready for an independent advocate who will put our region\u2019s interests over special interests and party priorities,\u201d Brown said. \u201cMy opponent is a leader in a dysfunctional Congress.\u201d\n\nThe 5th District is centered in Spokane, which has a metro population of more than 500,000 residents. The other roughly 200,000 residents of the district are scattered in small communities and rural areas. The district voted for President Donald Trump by 13 points in 2016.\n\nThe two candidates served in the state Legislature in the 1990s, where both were identified as rising stars.\n\nMcMorris Rodgers was elected to Congress in 2004, replacing George Nethercutt \u2014 the man who defeated Foley \u2014 who made a failed bid for a U.S. Senate seat.\n\nBrown served as majority leader of the state Senate before leaving in 2013 to become chancellor of Washington State University Spokane.\n\nMcMorris Rodgers has voted with the president nearly exclusively, although she has broken with him on the tariff war with China. Many Washington farmers export products to China, and the tariffs are hurting their business.\n\nBrown has pounded McMorris Rodgers for her 50-some votes to repeal the Affordable Care Act. McMorris Rodgers was the only one of four GOP House members from Washington who voted to repeal the law last year.\n\nAbout 86,000 people in the 5th District have federally subsidized insurance from the ACA, and the rate of people without health insurance in the district has fallen from more than 16 percent in 2013 to less than 6 percent in 2016.\n\nBrown has produced ads showing people who say they were helped by the law.\n\nVice President Mike Pence has come to Spokane to stump for McMorris Rodgers. Former President Barack Obama has endorsed Brown.\n\nMcMorris Rodgers, 49, has spent virtually her entire adult life in politics.\n\nAfter college she worked as a campaign manager and legislative aide for a member of the Washington statehouse, ultimately being appointed to his seat when he moved to the state Senate. She served in the Washington House from 1994 through 2004, when she was elected to Congress.\n\nBrown, 62, was first elected to the state Legislature in 1992 and moved to the state Senate in 1996. She was also an economics professor at Eastern Washington and Gonzaga universities before becoming chancellor of WSU Spokane.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "High winds knock out power to thousands\n\nBOSTON (AP) \u2014 Heavy rain and high winds have led to power outages across Massachusetts.\n\nNational Grid reported more than 14,000 power customers were in the dark Saturday afternoon.\n\nThe National Weather Service says wind gusts could reach 60 mph as a warm weather front moves out of the state.\n\nThat has led to the cancellation of some ferry service to Martha\u2019s Vineyard and Nantucket.", "HARTSHORNE, Okla.

He has been linked to several other racist robocalls, including a recent effort in Florida, where Democratic nominee Andrew Gillum would become the first black governor in his state\u2019s history.\n\nKemp issued a statement calling the tactic \u201cvile\u201d and \u201ccontrary to the highest ideals of our state and country,\u201d and condemning \u201cany person or organization that peddles this type of unbridled hate and unapologetic bigotry.\u201d\n\nThe Abrams camp likewise blasted the move but took a shot at Kemp and his highest profile supporter, President Donald Trump, who is coming to Georgia to campaign Sunday. A top Abrams aide said both Kemp and Trump have contributed to a poisonous atmosphere, and that Kemp has been silent on previous racially loaded attacks on Abrams.\n\n\u201cThese automated calls are being sent into homes just days before President Trump arrives, reminding voters exactly who is promoting a political climate that celebrates this kind of vile, poisonous thinking,\u201d said Abrams\u2019 spokeswoman Abigail Collazo.\n\nAbrams sidestepped the issue Saturday in brief public remarks as she greeted voters at an Atlanta shopping complex along with her local congressman, civil rights icon John Lewis.\n\n\u201cGeorgia has long been on a path of change and evolution,\u201d Abrams said. But she also said the election is about issues like expanding Medicaid insurance and focusing state spending on public education, job training and small business startups.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the only candidate with a plan to get that done and to do that without vitriol, without vilifying people,\u201d she added.\n\nLewis, the 78-year-old congressman who as a young man was severely beaten by police as he fought for voting rights in the Jim Crow South, put Georgia\u2019s choice in the broadest context: \u201cThis young lady is playing a major role in helping liberate all of us, liberate the state of Georgia, liberate the South, liberate America.\u201d\n\nKemp did not address the robocalls at his only scheduled campaign stop Saturday at a Cuban restaurant in a diverse north-Atlanta suburb.\n\nKemp told the packed crowd of supporters that the race for governor was a simple choice: one between continued economic prosperity under Republican leadership, or a turn to \u201csocialism\u201d under Democrats.\n\nKemp said the election was about \u201cthis generation and generations to come and the kind of state that we leave them.\u201d He then blasted Abrams\u2019 policy pitches on health care and education.\n\nThe Kemp event was also hit by a number of protesters. Two men protesting Kemp\u2019s immigration policy while Kemp was onstage were forcibly removed from the restaurant.\n\nAs a TV crew from MSNBC tried to film the hecklers being removed, a Kemp supporter physically blocked their path and the view of their lens.\n\nAnd someone out front was wearing a giant chicken suit holding a sign that reads \u201ctoo chicken to debate,\u201d alluding to Kemp withdrawing from a debate scheduled Sunday in favor of appearing in Macon with President Donald Trump.\n\nMuch of the final stretch of the race was consumed by a bitter battle over race and access to the polls.\n\nTensions grew after an Associated Press report in early October that more than 53,000 voter applications \u2014 nearly 70 percent of them from black applicants \u2014 were on hold with Kemp\u2019s office ahead of the election.\n\nMany of the applications were flagged for failing to pass the state\u2019s \u201cexact match\u201d verification process, which requires that identification information on voter registration applications precisely match information already on file.\n\nKemp\u2019s office says that eligible voters on the \u201cpending\u201d list can still vote if they bring a proper ID that substantially matches their registration information. He called the controversy \u201cmanufactured.\u201d\n\nBut critics say county officials aren\u2019t always trained to make the proper determination and the system can be particularly hard to navigate for recently naturalized citizens.\n\nIn response to a lawsuit brought by civil rights groups, a judge on Friday ruled the state unfairly burdens about 3,100 possible voters whose registration was flagged for citizenship issues.\n\nShe ruled that Georgia must immediately start allowing poll managers \u2014 not just deputy registrars \u2014 to clear flagged voters who show proof of citizenship.\n\nIn a statement, Kemp said the lawsuit forced the state \u201cto waste time and taxpayer dollars for the judge to tell us to do something that we already do.\u201d\n\n____\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "GREENVILLE, S.C.

From a scrum on the Scotland 22, North popped up in the line, far off his right wing, and slipped off centers Huw Jones and Alex Dunbar and carried Blair Kinghorn over the line in a superb solo try.\n\nThe 14-3 scoreline was fair on the run of play as Wales bossed the gainline.\n\nBut with five minutes to go, Scotland waived off a penalty shot in the 22 and went for a corner lineout.

And Embiid doesn\u2019t stop going at Drummond when the game is over.\n\nEmbiid scored 32 of his 39 points in a dominating first half and had 17 rebounds and then let Drummond know about it afterward, leading the 76ers to a 109-99 victory over the Pistons on Saturday.\n\nEmbiid made 10 of 18 field goals and 18 of 23 free throws to help Philadelphia improve to 6-0 at home.\n\nDrummond and Embiid have butted heads throughout their careers, with Embiid recently saying he \u201cowns real estate\u201d in Drummond\u2019s head after Detroit\u2019s big man was ejected in the Pistons\u2019 133-132 overtime victory on Oct. 23.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a fun matchup,\u201d Embiid said. \u201cI feel like I dominate every game, especially against him.\u201d\n\nPistons coach Dwane Casey and Drummond questioned the officiating. Drummond and backup center Zaza Pachulia were in foul trouble early trying to guard Embiid, and the teams combined for 63 fouls and 92 free-throw attempts.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand how the game was being called,\u201d Casey said.\n\nSaid Drummond, \u201cIt\u2019s like you have to play with your hands behind your back; you can\u2019t really touch nobody. That\u2019s the way they\u2019re calling the game right now. I have to figure a way to adjust. It\u2019s hard to play like that.\u201d\n\nEmbiid\u2019s first-half numbers were astounding. He made 8 of 9 shots, including his only 3-point attempt, and 15 of 17 free-throw attempts with eight rebounds and two blocks in 17 minutes in a one-sided duel with Drummond.\n\nDrummond went scoreless in four foul-plagued minutes in the opening half and finished with eight points and nine rebounds in 21 minutes.\n\nEmbiid went right at Drummond early on Saturday, drawing a foul just 1:24 into the contest and then a second on Drummond 1:16 later. The Philadelphia big man held up two fingers after that one, letting everyone know Drummond had picked up his second, and Drummond exited to the bench for Pachulia.\n\nPachulia was no match for Embiid either, drawing four fouls in 10 first-half minutes.\n\nThe 76ers\u2019 lead grew to as many as 24 points, 58-34, when rookie Landry Shamet converted a three-point play after draining a 13-foot jumper and the ensuing free throw.\n\nThe Pistons scored the first 13 points of the second half over 3:55 as Philadelphia went 0-for-5 with three turnovers to start the third period.

(AP) \u2014 Deb Haaland is not the first Native American woman to run for Congress, but she could be one of the first elected Tuesday.\n\nMore than 100 Native Americans are seeking seats in Congress, governor\u2019s offices, state legislatures and other posts across the country in what political observers say has been a record number of candidates.\n\nThe uptick comes amid the #MeToo movement and as President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has taken stances that many tribes say are attacks on their status as sovereign nations.\n\n\u201cThe Native folks on the ballot are getting lots of support, and I think that speaks volumes for our country,\u201d said Haaland, a member of Laguna Pueblo in New Mexico.\n\nMark Trahant, editor of Indian Country Today, has been tracking the names largely through crowdsourcing. On Election Day, he will co-host a program focusing on the Native American candidates that will be broadcast online, and on television and radio.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s needed because nobody\u2019s ever done it before,\u201d said Trahant, of the Shoshone-Bannock Tribe in Idaho.\n\nNative Americans make up about 2 percent of the U.S. population but often are underrepresented in political office. Congress has two Republican representatives: Markwayne Mullin, Cherokee, and Tom Cole, Chickasaw, from Oklahoma. Both are seeking re-election.\n\nIn New Mexico, Haaland has outraised her opponent in a congressional district that is considered safe for Democrats.\n\nRepublican Yvette Herrell, a member of the Cherokee Nation, is in a hotly contested race for an open seat in a southern New Mexico district. Herrell\u2019s campaign spokesman, Rob Burgess, said she hasn\u2019t made being Cherokee a focus of her campaign because she wants the race to be about the issues, rather than her heritage.\n\nDemocrat Sharice Davids, a member of the Ho-Chunk Nation, is a formidable challenge to a vulnerable four-term incumbent for a congressional seat in Kansas.\n\nA win by any of them would put a Native American woman in Congress for the first time.\n\nHaaland said she\u2019d be proud to have that designation to ensure the country recognizes the inequities tribes face, and the fight they\u2019ve been waging for decades for fishing, land, water and voting rights, and protections for Native women from violence. She knows it won\u2019t be easy.\n\nThe U.S. Interior Department under Trump recently reversed a decision to hold land in trust for a Massachusetts tribe. And many tribes say recent characterizations of tribes as a race, rather than political nations, in a federal court in Texas and by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services undermine their sovereignty.\n\nIf elected, Haaland said she would not waste opportunities to \u201cimpart some knowledge, some history, some perspective on any of my colleagues,\u201d and make sure tribal leaders are heard.\n\nIn statewide races, Minnesota will have its first Native American lieutenant governor. The candidates, Peggy Flanagan and Donna Bergstrom, both are members of tribal nations that are bands of Ojibwe.\n\nCoeur d\u2019Alene tribal member Paulette Jordan is seeking to become Idaho\u2019s first Native American governor. Though she has generated excitement, especially among Idaho\u2019s younger voters, the state\u2019s overwhelmingly conservative population means the numbers likely won\u2019t fall in her favor.\n\nTrahant will be joined by Antonia Gonzales, anchor and producer of public radio program National Native News, to broadcast the results. They partnered with California-based TV network First Nations Experience and Native Voice One, both of which are geared toward covering indigenous issues.\n\nMicah Wright, executive in charge of the television network, said pre-election testing highlighted another challenge in Indian Country \u2014 staying connected with reporters who will be sending in results. He said one person who tried to phone in couldn\u2019t because a tribe had blocked Skype believing it slowed service.\n\n\u201cTaking on something this ambitious is a risk and, at the same time, it\u2019s a risk worth doing,\u201d said Wright, of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation of Oklahoma.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "1 of 6 Syracuse's Eric Dungey (2) scrambles against Wake Forest in the first half of an NCAA college football game in Charlotte, N.C., Saturday, Nov. 3, 2018.

Stidham delivered big plays on both final drives.\n\nKellen Mond and the Aggies (5-4, 3-3) pushed the ball into Auburn territory on their final drive, converting a fourth-and-5. Then a holding call pushed them back across midfield and Mond\u2019s desperation pass to the end zone was incomplete.\n\nOfficials put one second back on the clock but Mond was sacked by Nick Coe on the final play.\n\n\u201cYou think the game\u2019s over,\u201d Auburn coach Gus Malzahn said. \u201cThe game\u2019s over, you shake the other coach\u2019s hand ... and then they tell you to come back out.\u201d\n\nThe Tigers, who had plummeted from a No. 8 ranking, trailed 24-14 before staging the rally.

They survived a series of self-inflicted wounds in the second half, sandwiching a pair of lost fumbles around a botched play on fourth and inches that resulted in a turnover on downs. \u201cIt got a little crazy there,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cTo their credit, they kept playing and they fought back. And we did most everything we could to try to help them.\u201d\n\nNorth Carolina: It was another heartbreaker for the Tar Heels, who lost their fifth consecutive game. North Carolina dropped to 5-19 in its last 24 games, a stretch that includes a 2-14 record in conference games and a 2-9 mark at home. \u201cIt\u2019s a challenge when you don\u2019t have success,\u201d North Carolina coach Larry Fedora said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t worry about the guys in that room getting back up off the mat.

Marshall rushed for 61 yards on eight carries, including a 44-yard scamper, before departing. Johnson said he stuck with Oliver because he thought the freshman gave the Yellow Jackets the best chance to win, based on how the game was unfolding. \u201cIt was a gut thing, a feel thing,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cProbably the rest of the way, that\u2019s kind of what it will be.\u201d\n\nTHE GOOD SON\n\nGeorgia Tech freshman defensive back Tre Swilling made his first interception, coming up with a one-handed theft of Elliott late in the first quarter. The play snapped Elliott\u2019s streak of 219 consecutive passes without an interception. Swilling is the son of former Georgia Tech star Pat Swilling, a former NFL All-Pro selection.

(AP) \u2014 Army is in rarefied air and coach Jeff Monken is impressed.\n\nThe third wheel in the annual round-robin series with service academy rivals Air Force and Navy \u2014 the Falcons have won the Commander-in-Chief\u2019s Trophy 20 times and the Midshipmen 15 \u2014 before Saturday Army had won the coveted hardware, emblematic of supremacy among the three schools, just seven times.\n\nMake that eight \u2014 and the first time in consecutive years.\n\nFullback Darnell Woolfolk rushed for 117 yards and a touchdown, Kelvin Hopkins Jr. scored on a 6-yard run, and Army held off rival Air Force 17-14 on Saturday.\n\nIt was the 11th straight victory at Michie Stadium for Army (7-2), which won the trophy outright last season for the first time since 1996 and will keep possession no matter the outcome of its game against archrival Navy next month.\n\n\u201cThat epitomizes the mental toughness of this team,\u201d Monken said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t always pretty. We could have done better. I\u2019m really, really glad that we won the game. It\u2019s an emotional game. It feels good to win.\n\n\u201cIt was a battle. I was proud our team was able to find a way to win. I think our guys were pressed into a corner. Give them (Air Force) credit. They were fighting, too.\u201d\n\nAir Force (3-6), which beat Navy 35-7 a month ago, is 33-14 in Commander in Chief\u2019s Trophy games against Army since the trophy was first awarded in 1972 and could have won the trophy again on Saturday with a victory. The Falcons had won 18 of the previous 21 in the series against the Black Knights, but they couldn\u2019t overcome a costly interception by Army\u2019s Mike Reynolds at the Army 4 in the final minute of the first half.\n\n\u201cThere was a chance to seize this one, but I\u2019m not putting any blame on the offense at all,\u201d Air Force linebacker Kyle Johnson said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t do the job just the same way they didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThe Falcons were unable to score in the opening half with Isaiah Sanders at quarterback, fell behind by two scores, and couldn\u2019t recover despite dominating the second half. Air Force outgained Army 212-77 after halftime with Donald Hammond III at quarterback. The Black Knights secured the victory when Hammond was stopped for no gain on a fourth-and-3 play at the Army 40 with under 2 minutes to play.\n\n\u201cWe were driving downfield. We should have made some plays we didn\u2019t make,\u201d Hammond said. \u201cI just wanted to win this game for the team. We\u2019re never going to give up. That\u2019s one thing we\u2019re not going to do.\u201d\n\nHammond, who excelled in the victory over Navy, accounting for four touchdowns in his first college start, replaced Sanders to start the third quarter and quickly hit Marcus Bennett for 31 yards into Army territory, but the drive ended when the Falcons were called for an illegal block on a fourth-and-3 play and had to punt.\n\nHammond had completions of 17 yards to Geraud Sanders and 13 yards to Marcus Bennett late in the third quarter, but the Falcons turned the ball over on downs when a fourth-down pass by Hammond attempt fell incomplete.\n\nThe Falcons finally caught a break when safety Jeremy Fejedelem got a hand on a punt by Army\u2019s Nick Schrage and it traveled just 4 yards to give Air Force a first down at the Army 34 and they capitalized. Hammond scored from the 1 two plays after converting a fourth-and-1 play, cutting the lead to 14-6 with under a minute to play in the third. Jake Koehnke\u2019s point-after try hit the left goalpost and stayed out.\n\nSenior John Abercrombie kicked a 30-yard field goal with 8:35 left to complete a 13-play drive that took 7:19 off the clock on a gusty day and gave Army a 17-6 lead midway through the fourth.\n\nUndaunted, Hammond drove the Falcons 75 yards in 10 plays to pull within a field goal. The drive was kept alive by a pass interference call against Army on a third-and-10 play. Cole Fagan\u2019s 30-yard catch-and-run set up Joseph Saucier\u2019s 6-yard touchdown run off a pitch. Saucier also converted on the 2-point try to make it 17-14.\n\n\u201cWhen our backs are against the wall, we never flinch,\u201d said Army linebacker Cole Christiansen, who combined with James Nachtigal to make the saving tackle on Hammond. \u201cDefinitely in the second half they came at us differently. We got it done.\u201d\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nAir Force: The Falcons are faltering in the Mountain West Conference at 1-4 and have to win their final three games to qualify for the postseason. At least two of the games are at Falcon Stadium.\n\nArmy: The Black Knights have beaten Air Force and Navy two straight times. Another victory over Navy in December will clinch the 170-pound trophy outright.\n\nNO GAMBLE\n\nTrailing 7-0 early in the second quarter, Air Force coach Troy Calhoun elected to punt on fourth-and-2 just inside Army territory. The Black Knights were 3 for 3 on fourth down to up their season total to 29 conversions in 32 attempts.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nAir Force hosts New Mexico next Saturday.\n\nArmy hosts FCS foe Lafayette next Saturday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "Wisconsin's Jonathan Taylor runs for a touchdown during the second half of an NCAA college football game against Rutgers Saturday, Nov. 3, 2018, in Madison, Wis.

Still, the first half had the sluggish pace of a nonconference game in early September.\n\nSaquon Hampton picked off Hornibrook twice in the first half. The defense also held Wisconsin scoreless after a drive that started at the Rutgers 41 set up by D\u2019Cota Dixon\u2019s 34-yard return of Van Ginkel\u2019s blocked field goal.\n\nRunning back Raheem Blackshear had eight catches for 162 yards and a touchdown to lead Rutgers, often getting chunk plays on screens or short passes as the Badgers tried to swarm freshman quarterback Artur Sitkowski.\n\n\u201cHe can do everything, pass block, he can run, he can catch the ball. We should definitely build off him,\u201d Sitkowski said.\n\nBlackshear also ran for 38 yards for 10 carries to give him 200 yards of total offense on the afternoon. Sitkowski was 20 of 39 for 261 yards but absorbed several hits from unblocked defenders.\n\nRutgers finally got its first touchdown with 8:14 left on Jonathan Hilliman\u2019s 1-yard run to get within 14.\n\nTAKEAWAYS\n\nRutgers: Trailing just 10-0 at the half might have been victory enough for the Scarlet Knights. Despite a big day by Taylor, the defense limited the Wisconsin passing game. Rutgers has allowed an average of 24.5 points over its last games, when coach Ash has taken a bigger role in defensive planning, after giving up 40.8 over its first six losses.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t made any changes,\u201d Ash said. \u201cWe just tried to get the guys, their attitude and their effort to show up and that\u2019s really been the difference.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s something about football and guys named Saquon...@RFootball\u2019s Saquon Hampton picks off Hornibrook for the second time today. \ud83d\udd25 pic.twitter.com/QdiXgaTXYN \u2014 Big Ten Network (@BigTenNetwork) November 3, 2018\n\nWisconsin: Hornibrook was 7 of 16 for 92 yards before leaving at the half with a head injury.

The governor\u2019s office and all three Cabinet seats are on the ballot; Republican Gov. Rick Scott is challenging three-term Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson; several congressional seats will be competitive; and Floridians will vote on 12 proposed constitutional amendments. Here are items of political interest from the past week.\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA ADVANTAGE?\n\nOK, so retweets and Facebook likes aren\u2019t votes, but a candidate\u2019s social media presence can be a sign of support. In the race for governor, Democratic Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum has a clear social media advantage over Republican former U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis.\n\nGillum\u2019s Twitter campaign account has more than 427,000 followers, compared to the more than 91,000 followers on DeSantis\u2019 campaign account. While DeSantis has more than 243,000 Twitter followers on the account set up for his congressional office, the account was deactivated when he resigned his seat Sept. 10. While Gillum still has an official account for the mayor\u2019s office, it only has 1,598 followers.\n\nGillum has nearly 203,000 people who follow his campaign Facebook page, compared to nearly 147,000 people who follow the DeSantis campaign page.\n\nIn the U.S. Senate race, Republican Gov. Rick Scott has a clear advantage over Democratic incumbent Bill Nelson when comparing Twitter campaign accounts. The Scott campaign has more than 50,000 followers, while the Nelson campaign has a little more than 13,000 followers.\n\nBut when it comes to their official government accounts, Nelson tops Scott with 369,000 followers compared to 209,000 for the governor.\n\nOn Facebook, the Scott campaign account dominates over Nelson, with more than 237,000 people following his political page. Nelson\u2019s campaign page has only 34,000 followers.\n\nBut when it comes to official government Facebook pages, nearly 236,000 people follow Nelson\u2019s Senate page, while Scott\u2019s office doesn\u2019t have a Facebook page.\n\nGREENE HANDS OUT THE GREEN \u2014 BUT NOT AS MUCH\n\nBillionaire Jeff Greene boasted about the help he\u2019s giving Democrats up and down the ballot, but it\u2019s a fraction of what he promised to spend had he won the nomination for governor.\n\nGreene spent nearly $36 million of his own money on the primary, only to come in fourth. Before losing, he set up a political committee and stocked it with $5 million that he said he\u2019d spend to help other Democrats if he were the nominee. Immediately after the election, he took the money back.\n\nThis week, he sent out a press release saying he contributed $100,000 to help Democratic nominee for governor Andrew Gillum, $100,000 for a political committee supporting Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson and $25,000 for a committee backing Democratic agriculture commissioner nominee Nikki Fried.\n\nTHE FINAL TALLY\n\nWhen Florida\u2019s campaign for governor started, Andrew Gillum and Ron DeSantis were far behind their rivals in raising money for their campaigns.\n\nThe final campaign finance reports show, however, the two main candidates raised more than $100 million altogher, between their regular campaign accounts and their political committees. Much of that money flowed in after the August primary.\n\nDeSantis raised nearly $54 million, while Gillum hauled in nearly $53 million.\n\nGillum, who upset other candidates to win the Democratic primary, has received backing from some well-known billionaires such as investor George Soros who has given $1.2 million in the last 18 months. Gillum has also received $2.8 million from the group formed by hedge fund billionaire Thomas Steyer.\n\nGillum also got $7.5 million from the Democratic Governors Association.\n\nThe Republican Governors Association, meanwhile, gave $3 million directly to DeSantis\u2019s political committee, but the group also independently spent money on ads aimed to boost DeSantis\u2019s campaign.\n\nChicago hedge fund manager Kenneth Griffin donated $5.75 million to DeSantis, while Isaac and his wife Laura Perlmutter gave him $2.5 million.

(AP Photo/Orlin Wagner)\n\nLAWRENCE, Kan. (AP) \u2014 Iowa State coach Matt Campbell is a firm believer that great teams win in the red zone.\n\nThey make sure to put points on the board when they venture inside the 20-yard line, and they have the ability to turn teams back when their defense has its back against the wall.\n\nThat proved to be the case Saturday.\n\nBrock Purdy threw a short touchdown pass to cap a three-TD performance, and the Cyclones kept stopping Kansas on fourth down on the doorstep of the end zone, allowing them to cruise to a 27-3 win \u2014 their fourth straight since installing their freshman quarterback under center.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of confidence down there,\u201d Campbell said of the red zone. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a ton of five-star players so our margin for error is very small.\u201d\n\nThe margin of victory Saturday was plenty big.\n\nPurdy finished with 263 yards passing in another stellar performance, and his other two TD tosses were big-play strikes to Hakeem Butler. David Montgomery ran for 67 yards and Purdy added 53 more on the ground as the Cyclones (5-3, 4-2) kept alive their hopes of playing in the Big 12 title game.\n\n\u201cWithout a doubt,\u201d Iowa State defensive end Matt Leo said. \u201cJust trust the process.\u201d\n\nThe Jayhawks\u2019 Peyton Bender was just 19 of 40 for 185 yards, though he had several passes dropped, including one for a certain TD by Stephon Robinson early in the game. Khalil Herbert added 91 yards on the ground in what amounted to the only bright spot for coach David Beaty\u2019s team.\n\nNow, the calls for his job are sure to grow louder.\n\nThe Jayhawks (3-6, 1-5) upset TCU last week to give Beaty a week\u2019s reprieve, but his team looked woefully unprepared Saturday. Substitution mistakes, four failed fourth downs and a myriad other issues made for an ugly showing in front of a sparse crowd made up of about 50 percent Iowa State fans.\n\n\u201cObviously I didn\u2019t do a very good job because things that we\u2019ve executed well all week, we weren\u2019t able to connect on now,\u201d Beaty said. \u201cThat\u2019s unfortunate because they were there. We just weren\u2019t able to connect on them. That comes down to the person coaching them. That\u2019s me.\u201d\n\nAt least Purdy and Butler gave those wearing red a chance to cheer.\n\nAfter forcing an early three-and-out, the Cyclones needed three plays for their young quarterback to hit his tall, lanky wide receiver deep downfield. Butler was so far behind the coverage on their 83-yard TD strike that the Jayhawks gave up and jogged behind him to the end zone.\n\nThen, after another three-and-out, the Cyclones needed only two plays for Purdy to hit his big-play target downfield. Butler leaped over Hasan Defense to snare the jump ball, then turned and coasted 51 yards for another touchdown and a 14-0 lead.\n\nThe Cyclones tacked on a pair of field goals as they built a 20-3 halftime lead.\n\n\u201cCoach had a great gameplan, he had us in position to make many plays, and we ain\u2019t do it,\u201d Defense said. \u201cSo we shouldn\u2019t have been down to where we felt we had to bounce back.\u201d\n\nPurdy added his third touchdown toss when he found Matthew Eaton open early in the third quarter to make it 27-3, and Iowa State merely coasted the rest of the way.\n\n\u201cWe had plenty of opportunities.

The two entities also sought a ruling that would apply to future disclosures.\n\nAttorney Michele Earl-Hubbard represented the news organizations and said the names of patients identified in police reports were of public interest.

(AP Photo/Gary Cameron)\n\nCOLLEGE PARK, Md. (AP) \u2014 A tumultuous week for Maryland ended with a sobering defeat.\n\nMichigan State capped a rough stretch for the unsettled Terrapins football program, using a stout defensive performance to secure a 24-3 victory on Saturday.\n\nThe Terrapins (5-4, 3-3 Big Ten) managed only 100 yards and nine first downs for interim coach and offensive coordinator Matt Canada.\n\nConnor Heyward ran for 157 yards and two touchdowns to help the Spartans (6-3, 4-2 Big Ten) become a bowl eligible for the 11th time in 12 years, the only exception a 3-9 stumble in 2016.\n\nThe loss followed the reinstatement, then dismissal, of Maryland head coach DJ Durkin over the span of two days.\n\n\u201cThis week was a challenging week. That\u2019s a fact. You guys all know that,\u201d Canada said. \u201cBut we came in and worked every day. Our kids played hard. We lost today because we just didn\u2019t play well enough. We played a really good football team and I didn\u2019t coach well enough.\u201d\n\nCanada spoke alone, opting not to make the players available to the media.\n\n\u201cOur players are more than capable of speaking and they will,\u201d Canada said. \u201cThey\u2019ve had a big week, a challenging week.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, Durkin was reinstated by the University System board of regents following a probe into the culture of the football program. The investigation was launched soon after school president Wallace Loh acknowledged in August that \u201cmistakes were made\u201d in the treatment of Maryland offensive lineman Jordan McNair, who collapsed during an offseason workout and died two weeks later of heatstroke.\n\nThe decision to bring Durkin back from paid administrative leave created such a furor among students and politicians that Loh fired Durkin on Wednesday.\n\nOn Thursday, the board of regents chairman resigned from his post.\n\nSeveral outlets reported that three players walked out of a meeting with Durkin on Tuesday. After practice that day, the backup punter, who had spoken out about the coaching staff, was reportedly assaulted by a teammate who supported Durkin.\n\nComing off all those distractions, the Terrapins were looking to become bowl eligible with their third win in four games. Instead, they fell behind early and never got the offense working.\n\nThe Spartans scored on their first possession, added a first-quarter field goal and went up 17-3 in the third quarter when Max Rosenthal recovered a Heyward fumble in the end zone.\n\n\u201cHuge win for us,\u201d Michigan State coach Mark Dantonio said. \u201cWe stayed focused on the task at hand, which was to win No. 6.\u201d\n\nDantonio fully understood Maryland\u2019s unique situation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure there were a lot of distractions. They have faced a very emotional tragedy earlier in the year,\u201d Dantonio said. \u201cFor that, we are all very sorry. Everything else that\u2019s going on is difficult for us to comprehend, being on the outside looking in. But our thoughts and our prayers go with the McNair family and also our thoughts are with the entire Maryland football program as they move through challenging times.\u201d\n\nMaryland\u2019s effort to come back was thwarted by two fourth-quarter turnovers. Javon Leake lost a fumble on the MSU 26 and Byron Cowart fumbled on an interception return with the Spartans recovering in the end zone for a touchback.\n\n\u201cWe make that score, it\u2019s 17-10 with 11 minutes to go, we\u2019re right in the game,\u201d Canada said.\n\nOn the next play, Heyward ran for an 80-yard touchdown for a 24-3 lead with 11 minutes left.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how to describe it,\u201d Heyward said. \u201cYou\u2019re just smiling and then looking at the Jumbo screen hoping you don\u2019t get caught.\u201d\n\nMaryland\u2019s strong running game was limited to 26 yards (on 29 carries) by the nation\u2019s top-ranked rushing defense. Kasim Hill went 8 for 21 for 74 yards for the Terps on a very windy day.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nMichigan State: After putting off a decision on his starting quarterback until late in the week, Dantonio settled on senior Brian Lewerke, who returned from a shoulder injury to go 11 for 20 for 87 yards and an interception before being replaced by redshirt freshman Rocky Lombardi.\n\n\u201cI know there were a lot of distractions this week over here (at Maryland), but same for us, not knowing exactly what\u2019s going on as well,\u201d Dantonio said.\n\nThe Spartans have some work to do in the passing game, but the defense is good enough to make up for that and keep them competitive against any foe.\n\nMaryland: When the Terps are bad, they\u2019re bad. Maryland\u2019s one-dimensional offense sputtered again, and those two turnovers in the fourth quarter didn\u2019t help. Maryland\u2019s four losses this season have come by a combined 86 points.\n\nEJECTED\n\nTerrapins defensive tackle Mbi Tanyi was ejected in the second quarter for throwing a punch at a Michigan State player.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nMichigan State: The Spartans host No. 8 Ohio State.\n\nMaryland: The Terrapins travel to Indiana.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "ALEXANDRIA, La.

(Adam Davy, PA via AP)\n\nLONDON (AP) \u2014 One way or another, Owen Farrell was going to be the decisive factor in a tense finale between England and South Africa.\n\nThe England flyhalf was relieved it was his late penalty, and not a disputed tackle, that turned out to be the decisive moment in a 12-11 win over the Springboks at Twickenham on Saturday.\n\nFarrell\u2019s kick put England ahead in the 73rd minute.

Pollard was unable to convert, and another Farrell penalty kept England within two points, despite the Springboks having had two-thirds of the possession.\n\n\u201cIt was a frustrating test match,\u201d South Africa coach Rassie Erasmus said. \u201cThere\u2019s certainly a lot of things that we did well but then obviously there were the two obvious things that we didn\u2019t do well - finish the opportunities and our discipline.\u201d\n\nSouth Africa was dominating the scrum, so Ben Moon made his England debut at halftime. An injury to flanker Tom Curry saw Zach Mercer - another England debutant - follow moments later.\n\nEngland finally began to enjoy some possession in the opposition half and took the lead in the 50th thanks to a Daly penalty from the halfway line.\n\nThe home side was in the ascendancy as tiring legs led to more open passages of play, but Pollard put the Boks ahead.\n\nIronically, the scrum which caused so many problems for England in the first half proved decisive as England earned a penalty on a South Africa feed. Farrell, who was limping after a big tackle moments earlier, nonchalantly kicked England back in from near the left touchline.\n\nThen the England co-captain almost undid all of his good work. The referee appeared to blow the final whistle, but a review was called on Farrell\u2019s shoulder-leading hit on Esterhuizen. After a tense wait, no action was taken.\n\nThe victory gives England crucial confidence ahead of the All Blacks\u2019 visit to Twickenham next weekend.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t wait to get them,\u201d Jones said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "", "MIDDLETON, Idaho (AP) \u2014 Fourteen staff members at an Idaho school district who donned caricatured outfits depicting Mexican people and a border wall emblazoned with \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d have been placed on paid administrative leave.\n\nMiddleton School District superintendent Josh Middleton announced the decision Saturday at a special school board meeting.\n\nAfter the announcement, the board went into executive session, which is not open to the public.\n\nBoard Chairman Tim Winkle says the costumes were part of a team building activity after school hours.\n\nPhotos were posted to the district\u2019s Facebook page Thursday night and later removed, but screenshots captured the images that went viral.\n\nMiddleton is about 34 miles (55 kilometers) west of Boise, with 7,500 residents.

(AP) \u2014 Oilfield byproduct water is now a resource instead of a waste, and that new resource may improve the livelihoods of farmers and ranchers.\n\nEncore Green and the Beneficial-Use Water Alliance last Monday watered local rancher Owen Goertz\u2019s grazing grass with cleaned byproduct water from the hydraulic fracturing process.\n\nJeff Holder, director of the Beneficial-Use Water Alliance, said Marvin Nash, founder of Encore Green, used existing technology to develop a new method to clean the byproduct water.\n\nHe said byproduct, or \u201cproduced,\u201d water contains some oil, as well as sand and other elements that make it unsuitable for use.\n\n\u201cI think the (statistic) is: 71 billion gallons of water was essentially thrown away (in 2017) in the state of Wyoming,\u201d Holder said.\n\nThat water usually is injected into an underground injection well to dispose of it, he said.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t really know what we\u2019re putting back into the ground, and we are not 100 percent sure we know exactly where that water is going,\u201d Holder told the Wyoming Tribune Eagle. \u201cIt\u2019s already becoming difficult for the regulators to see their way clear to keep doing this.\u201d\n\nHolder explained that, especially with fracking, 35 times the amount of water comes out of the ground as crude oil.\n\nHe said the oil companies generally have large quantities of water to dispose of every day, while ranchers and farmers are desperate for water. So, if the water can be cleaned and made usable by the nearby ranchers and farmers, both parties win.\n\nNash\u2019s idea, which they now are implementing, is to use the same money that oil companies would spend disposing of the water to clean it instead.\n\nHolder likened the process to recycling trash instead of just taking it to the dump.\n\n\u201cWhen you put your trash out, and the garbage truck comes and takes it away, in your mind, you\u2019ve disposed of your trash,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the oil company trucks their byproduct water away and puts it in an injection well, they have disposed of it.\u201d\n\nBut in both cases, the waste has only been moved.\n\nOne of the most important pieces of this effort is that not only is the water clean, but it\u2019s cleaned to match exactly what the surrounding soil needs. The water used on Goertz\u2019s land Monday was customized for his soil.\n\nHolder explained that the farm or ranch soil is tested to see what elements it may need, and then the technology cleans out any elements that are not needed and leaves elements, such as nitrogen, that the soil does need.\n\nNash said they\u2019re cleaning the water through a process called thermal heat, though reverse osmosis would also have been an option.\n\nHe said the cleaning process will help farmers and ranchers by providing enough water to keep their crops growing.\n\nNash added that Goertz collected about 600 bales of hay this year to feed his cattle over the winter.\n\n\u201cWhat happens if we get a really long winter, and their 600 bales of hay are gone?\u201d he said. \u201cIf we could have gotten them more water on their 5,000 acres of deeded land, and we could have gotten them from 600 bales to 1,000 bales, now we\u2019ve made a difference.\u201d\n\nGoertz said, \u201cI think it\u2019s high time we did something with this wastewater other than just putting it down the disposal well, if we can do it. It\u2019s going to take some energy to process this stuff. It doesn\u2019t come free.\u201d\n\nJim Pike, district conservationist for Laramie County for the National Resources Conservation Service, said much of Laramie County gets water from the Ogallala Aquifer, which has gone dry in some areas of Texas or Oklahoma.\n\n\u201cIf we can reuse the water (from fracking), it will reduce the pressure from all of that groundwater,\u201d he said.\n\nHolder said the process also could provide water to grow grass in areas that previously were just dirt, thereby stopping soil erosion in the area and providing more oxygen.\n\nU.S. Department of Energy Secretary Rick Perry announced the Water Security Grand Challenge on Thursday. One of the challenges specifically asks the department\u2019s national labs to transform energy sector produced water from a waste into a resource.\n\nHolder said, \u201cWhat we\u2019ve done here is we\u2019ve proven that (cleaning byproduct water) works.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Wyoming Tribune Eagle, http://www.wyomingnews.com", "", "", "AFTON, Minn.

Over and over, his sound attested to and sanctified his deep love for music. His unselfish timbre covered the waterfront of every musical landscape.\u201d\n\nMany of Hargrove\u2019s peers regarded him as the greatest trumpeter of his generation. Through his own bands and as a sideman, Hargrove brewed his jazz with African and Latin sounds, R&B, soul, pop, funk and hip-hop.\n\nHe led the progressive, genre-melding group The RH Factor, played in sessions for Common, Erykah Badu and D\u2019Angelo, and collaborated with jazz giants including Herbie Hancock and Wynton Marsalis.\n\n\u201cHe is literally the one man horn section I hear in my head when I think about music,\u201d Questlove, drummer and leader of the Roots, said on Instagram Saturday. \u201cLove to the immortal timeless genius that will forever be Roy Hargrove y\u2019all.\u201d\n\nA native of Waco, Texas, Hargrove was discovered by his fellow trumpeter Marsalis while Hargrove was playing at a performing-arts high school in Dallas. He went on to the Berklee College of Music in Boston and then transferred to the New School in New York, where he joined in jam sessions at jazz clubs in the evening. One of those clubs, the Blue Note, said on its Twitter account Saturday that Hargrove was a \u201cyoung master and friend gone too soon.\u201d\n\nHargrove released his first solo album, \u201cDiamond in the Rough,\u201d in 1990.

(Courtesy of Stacey Jimenez via AP)\n\nEmbers falling on their heads, Venesa Rhodes and her husband had seconds to rush their two beloved cats into their SUV before a wildfire last summer would overtake them all.\n\nOne cat got in. But the other, named Bella, bolted and disappeared as the blaze bore down. The couple had no choice but to flee, and their home and much of the neighborhood in Redding, California, soon was reduced to ash.\n\nRhodes and her husband, Stephen Cobb, presumed Bella was dead. Devastated by their losses, they moved 1,800 miles (2,900 kilometers) to Rhodes\u2019 hometown of Anchorage, Alaska, to start over.\n\nNearly six weeks later, they got a call that left them gobsmacked: Bella was alive. Volunteers had put out a feeding station at Rhodes\u2019 burned-out property, staked it out after spotting the cat, and then trapped her.\n\n\u201cI started bawling,\u201d Rhodes said from Anchorage, where Bella was curled up in a corner sleeping. \u201cWe were shocked. We were just so overjoyed and just hoping she was OK.\u201d\n\nRhodes and Cobb are among dozens of people who lost their homes in the deadly Carr Fire but had their lives brightened weeks or months later when their pets were found.\n\nA network of about 35 volunteers \u2014 called Carr Fire Pet Rescue and Reunification \u2014 is responsible for many of the happy endings, which continue more than two months after firefighters extinguished the blaze, which destroyed more than 1,000 homes and killed six people.\n\nThe group formed with the help of another volunteer animal group born out of the devastating Tubbs Fire, which killed at least 22 people and destroyed thousands of homes last year in wine country north of San Francisco.\n\nRobin Bray, a field coordinator for the Carr Fire group, said about 80 pets have been reunited with their families using social media and specially made kiosks in Redding where images of found pets are posted. Most are cats that have \u201cbeen through hell,\u201d she said.\n\nBray said each new reunion fuels her and the other volunteers, many of whom use their own money to trap and treat the animals.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen amazing things,\u201d Bray said. \u201cWe\u2019re finding cats that were in a house and the owners presumed they had passed. The heat of fire breaks windows in houses and cats jump out and run and hide. They\u2019re survivalists.\u201d\n\nThe volunteers go to elaborate lengths to catch the animals, which often are traumatized and injured. Equipped with night-vision cameras, traps and lots of food for bait, the volunteers stake out an area where a missing pet has been spotted, waiting for the right moment to drop a trap.\n\nThey won a hard-fought rescue of a dog nicknamed Buddy on Oct. 27 after he had eluded capture for weeks. They tried luring him with steak and french fries, another dog and a pickup truck like the one his owner drove before finally nabbing him.\n\nIt was a two-woman, two-hour operation. One woman crawled on the ground and placed food under a trap and the other waited in a truck and pulled a rope to complete the capture.\n\nBray, a private pilot by day, once spent nearly seven hours trapping a cat. The wait was worth it, she said.\n\n\u201cSo many of these people have lost everything,\u201d Bray said. \u201cThe only thing they care about is finding their pet that they love. They want that hope back in their lives and we\u2019re trying to provide that.\u201d\n\nJessica Pierce, a Lyons, Colorado-based bioethicist who studies end-of-life issues involving humans and their pets, said losing a beloved animal and a home is a double whammy of grief.\n\n\u201cTo then be reunited with a pet you thought was gone, that would be like getting a piece of your home back,\u201d she said. \u201cFor many people, pets are a sense of home, and they identify home with a sense of comfort and peace.\u201d\n\nSteve and Susan Cortopassi were reunited with their cat, Big Ernie, on Oct. 3, more than two months after the fire started. Their other cat, Elsa, was found about three weeks after the fire, which destroyed their home of 30 years.\n\nThe Cortopassis had to evacuate in the middle of the night. They grabbed their two dogs but weren\u2019t able to track down the cats. A friend showed Cortopassi cellphone video of her destroyed home a couple days after the fire and she figured the cats were gone forever.\n\n\u201cIt was just complete and utter devastation,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a miracle they\u2019re alive. It\u2019s like, life finds a way.\u201d\n\nRhodes got her call on Sept. 2, 41 days after the fire began. Bella, who is 2, had some burns on her belly, her long black hair was singed to medium length and she was underweight. Her formerly gray paws are now permanently pink.\n\nWhen she was found, Rhodes and Cobb drove to Redding over five days with their other cat, Mama, so the whole family could be reunited. After staying in a hotel for another five days to make sure Bella was OK, the whole family returned to Alaska.\n\n\u201cWe have friends that don\u2019t even like cats thinking how crazy we were and we just said, \u2018They\u2019re part of our family,\u2019\u201d Rhodes said. \u201cI lost a lot.

LOUIS - Saundra McDowell, the Republican candidate for Missouri state auditor, poses for a photo Friday, Nov. 2, 2018, in Des Peres, Mo. McDowell faces incumbent Auditor Nicole Galloway in the November 6 election. (AP Photo/Jim Salter)\n\nST. LOUIS (AP) \u2014 Auditor Nicole Galloway is one of just two Democrats in statewide offices in Missouri, and if she\u2019s going to keep her job, she might need some help from the other one.\n\nGalloway faces Republican Saundra McDowell in the election Tuesday. Though Galloway holds a big fundraising edge and McDowell faces questions about her residency and personal finances, experts say the fact that Galloway is a Democrat in a red state means she could still use some top-of-the-ticket help from Sen. Claire McCaskill, who is in a tough re-election battle against Republican Attorney General Josh Hawley in the only other statewide race on the ballot.\n\n\u201cI think Galloway has a little bit of an advantage, but this is a Republican state and everything depends on turnout, and to some extent on turnout at the top of the ticket for McCaskill,\u201d said David Robertson, a political scientist at the University of Missouri-St. Louis.\n\nGalloway, 36, is a relative newcomer to state politics, thrust into her position by tragedy. She was Boone County treasurer in 2015 when Auditor Tom Schweich took his own life. Then-Gov. Jay Nixon, a Democrat, appointed Galloway as the replacement.\n\n\u201cIt was a very public tragedy,\u201d Galloway said. \u201cI\u2019m proud of the way we navigated those difficulties and that transition.\u201d\n\nGalloway said audits during her tenure have identified more than $300 million in waste and abuses, and resulted in nearly three dozen criminal charges.\n\n\u201cPeople feel the system is rigged against them, that there are these powerful people in government that make decisions on their behalf that they don\u2019t really understand how or why those decisions are being made,\u201d Galloway said. \u201cIt\u2019s my job to fight for transparency and accountability in that way.\u201d\n\nThe auditor\u2019s office is designed to determine whether tax dollars are spent efficiently, economically and legally, according to the office website. Among the entities the office reviews are state agencies, boards and commissions, statewide elected officials, the legislature, municipal and circuit courts and 90 of the state\u2019s 114 counties. The job pays nearly $108,000 a year.\n\nMcDowell is a 38-year-old attorney who has worked for the Missouri secretary of state and attorney general offices. She defeated three other challengers in the August primary.\n\nCampaign finance reports show that Galloway had $1.3 million on hand as of October. McDowell had $26,458.\n\nMcDowell said the financial disparity makes her work that much harder, visiting countless ice cream socials, barbecues and other local events across the state.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have over a million dollars like my opponent does so I\u2019m doing it the hard way and I\u2019m reaching as many people as I can,\u201d McDowell said.\n\nMcDowell said that part of her drive to run for auditor was spurred by her time in the Missouri secretary of state\u2019s securities division, where she worked with auditors and investigators. As a private attorney she also has overseen fraud investigations.\n\nShe also cited her eight years in the Air Force.\n\n\u201cJust taking that oath to protect your country, that never goes away,\u201d McDowell said.\n\nCampaign finances aren\u2019t McDowell\u2019s only hurdle. The Missouri Constitution requires the auditor to be a state resident for at least 10 years. McDowell was in law school in Virginia in 2008, though she said she intended to move to Missouri, her husband\u2019s home state.\n\nThat intent meets the residency requirement, McDowell said, citing a legal case from nearly five decades ago. Republican Kit Bond was elected auditor in 1970 even though he had lived outside the state. The Missouri Supreme Court ruled that residency \u201cis largely a matter of intention\u201d and does not require physical presence.\n\nGalloway also has raised concerns about McDowell\u2019s personal finances, noting that McDowell has been sued seven times in the last five years for unpaid bills and has more than $50,000 in garnishments and judgments against her.\n\nChief among those issues: McDowell and her husband were ordered to pay $32,658 to a Springfield landlord in 2015.\n\nMcDowell said the order was the result of a lawsuit that she and her husband lost, not financial mismanagement. She said they opted to repay the money instead of challenge the court ruling.\n\nGalloway has faced her own scrutiny. A judge is weighing arguments in a lawsuit alleging that she allowed text messages to be deleted in the face of an open records request. The conservative nonprofit Missouri Alliance for Freedom filed a request in May 2017 for a broad swath of records relating to Galloway\u2019s scrutiny of then-Republican Gov. Eric Greitens\u2019 Department of Revenue regarding state income tax refunds. Two other requests for records from Galloway\u2019s office followed.\n\nJoel Anderson, Galloway\u2019s chief litigation counsel, said the nonprofit was given screenshots of some text messages, as well as 45,000 pages of emails and other communications.

(AP Photo/Rick Bowmer)\n\nSALT LAKE CITY (AP) \u2014 Former GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney is stumping for fellow Republican candidates as he sails toward a likely victory Tuesday in the race for a U.S. Senate seat from Utah and a return to public office.\n\nWhile he\u2019s largely avoided direct criticism of President Donald Trump since a scathing speech in 2016, Romney has said he would speak out on significant issues. On Thursday, he took issue with Trump\u2019s characterization of the media as an \u201cenemy of the people,\u201d saying that a free press is essential to the \u201ccause of freedom.\u201d\n\nThe online essay was published in the final days before an election when Romney is knocking on doors and joining phone banks for local, state and congressional races in his adopted home state.\n\nThe next evening, he read scary stories to children at a corn maze in Lehi, Utah.\n\nHe and his wife, Anne, sat around a small bonfire with over 100 children and adults. Mitt Romney also judged a pumpkin pie-eating contest at Cornbelly\u2019s Corn Maze and Pumpkin Fest.\n\nRomney has crossed state lines in recent weeks to stump for Republican candidate Martha McSally in Arizona, where she\u2019s locked in a tight race for the Senate seat left open by Jeff Flake\u2019s decision not to run again.\n\nRomney has also helped with fundraising for Nevada Sen. Dean Heller\u2019s tight re-election campaign and Florida Gov. Rick Scott\u2019s run for the Senate.\n\nRomney\u2019s opponent, Democrat Jenny Wilson, also is working the phones and canvassing for her party\u2019s slate. She has criticized Romney\u2019s Arizona appearance as evidence that he\u2019s more focused on national politics.\n\nRomney\u2019s camp points to his meetings and campaign appearances with dozens of Utah officials. It\u2019s part of his effort to get out the vote and promote down-ballot candidates, said spokeswoman MJ Henshaw.\n\nThe two are vying for the Senate seat to replace Orrin Hatch, who is retiring from the Senate after four decades. The outgoing Republican helped convince Romney to run. Romney appears to be a shoo-in for the seat in the conservative state that hasn\u2019t sent a Democrat to the Senate since 1977.\n\nWilson is a member of the Salt Lake County Council and has a political pedigree as the daughter of a former mayor there.\n\nRomney is one of the most well-known faces in the state since running as the first Mormon presidential nominee of a major political party in 2012, as well as his work leading the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City.\n\nHe moved to Utah full-time after his presidential loss to Barack Obama. While criticism of Trump has been a political liability for Republicans elsewhere, Romney is able to speak out because many voters are wary of Trump\u2019s bombastic style and comments about women and immigrants.\n\nArguing his high political profile would be a boon to Utah, Romney easily dispatched a rival Republican state lawmaker who forced him into a June primary. He fulfilled a campaign promise to release his tax returns last week, showing he and his wife had a combined gross income of $22.3 million last year.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "Everton's Richarlison celebrates scoring his side's third goal of the game during the English Premier League soccer match between Everton and Brighton and Hove Albion at Goodison Park stadium, Liverpool, England.

Bibi was arrested in 2009 on allegations that she insulted Islam\u2019s Prophet Muhammad.\n\n___\n\n11:15 a.m.\n\nNationwide protests triggered by a Christian woman\u2019s acquittal on blasphemy charges have ended following an overnight deal between Islamists and the government.\n\nUnder the agreement, Asia Bibi may not leave the country until the Pakistan Supreme Court\u2019s ruling is reviewed.\n\nAuthorities cleared the intersections of major cities after supporters of the Tehreek-e-Labbaik Party dispersed upon announcement of the agreement.\n\nReligious Affairs Minister Noorul Haq Qadri announced that authorities will now not allow Bibi to leave the country until the Supreme Court makes a final review of its verdict. A petition had already been filed for the review.\n\nBibi spent eight year on death row.\n\nMeanwhile, Pakistani authorities were making arrangements for the funeral of prominent cleric Maulana Samiul Haq who was killed Friday at his home in Rawalpindi.", "HICKSVILLE, N.Y.

Owned by Brazil great Ronaldo, it entered the match at Santiago Bernabeu Stadium on a six-match unbeaten streak. The defeat left it in eighth place.\n\n\u201cIn the second half we played better than Madrid,\u201d Valladolid coach Sergio Gonzalez said. \u201cI\u2019m happy for that but frustrated by the result, which doesn\u2019t reflect the enormous effort of my players.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "Athens State University hires firm to look for new president\n\nATHENS, Ala.

Franklin, File)\n\nLos Angeles Dodgers third base coach Chris Woodward was hired as manager of the Texas Rangers on Saturday, six weeks after Jeff Banister was fired.\n\nHe received a three-year contract with a club option for 2022. He will be introduced at a news conference Monday.\n\nWoodward inherits a team that went 67-95 and finished last in the AL West, with the focus turning to the development of younger players. Texas had its first consecutive losing seasons since 2005-08.\n\nThe hiring ended a process during which general manager Jon Daniels and the Rangers interviewed more than 10 candidates, including bench coach Don Wakamatsu after he served as interim coach the final 10 games of the season.\n\nWoodward was interviewed this week after the Dodgers finished their second straight season in which they advanced to the World Series, losing both times. The last team before Los Angeles that appeared in consecutive World Series without winning the title was Texas in 2010 and 2011.\n\n\u201cWe interviewed a number of strong candidates during an extensive interview process for our managerial role and believe we have found the right fit in Chris Woodward,\u201d Daniels said in a statement released by the team. \u201cWe look forward to working with him and everyone on the baseball staff to develop and grow a culture that will lead to success for many years to come.\u201d\n\nDaniels has hired three managers in his 13 seasons as the Rangers GM, and all were first-time MLB managers. Texas won its only American League pennants during Ron Washington\u2019s eight seasons before Banister won two AL West titles in his four seasons.\n\nTwo candidates Texas interviewed were hired last month as managers by other teams, David Bell in Cincinnati and Rocco Baldelli in Minnesota. The hiring of Woodward left the Baltimore Orioles, who fired Buck Showalter after the season, as the only MLB team with a managerial vacancy.\n\nThe 42-year-old Woodward spent the past three years on the staff of manager Dave Roberts, after working for Seattle the previous three years. He started his coaching career as minor league infield coordinator for the Mariners in 2013, then joined their big league staff later that year. He was Seattle\u2019s infield coach in 2014 and the first base coach in 2015.\n\n\u201cChris brings high energy, outstanding leadership and communication skills, a strong knowledge of the game and its evolving strategies, and great integrity \u2014 attributes that we feel are vital for our next manager,\u201d Daniels said. \u201cWe believe these traits will resonate with our players, our staff, and our fans. He has also been a big part of a very successful stretch in Los Angeles.\u201d\n\nAs a player, Woodward spent 12 seasons (1999-2011) with five teams \u2014 Toronto, the New York Mets, Seattle, Atlanta and Boston. He hit .239 with 33 home runs and 191 RBIs while playing every position except pitcher and catcher.\n\nWoodward was teammates with Adrian Beltre for a short period during the 2009 season with the Mariners. Beltre, who has 3,166 career hits, just completed his 21st big league season and hasn\u2019t said yet if he will return to play for the Rangers again next year.\n\nWhen Beltre went on the disabled list during the 2009 season, Woodward started 13 games at third base in his place. Soon after Beltre\u2019s return that August, Woodward was selected off waivers by the Boston Red Sox.\n\nThe Rangers went 87-75 in 2009 before their two World Series seasons, then lost in the AL\u2019s first one-and-done wild-card game in 2012. They ended the 2013 regular season with a loss to Tampa Bay in a wild-card tiebreaker.\n\nWhen Banister was fired Sept. 21 with 10 games left in this season, Daniels acknowledged that the decision wasn\u2019t based on the record and said instead that it was time for a new voice in leadership. Banister was under contract through next season.\n\nWoodward is a native of Covina, California, as is Michael Young, the Rangers career leader in hits and games played who is now a special assistant to the general manager. They are the same age but played at different high schools.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "The Ogden City Council and police in the northern Utah city apologized Saturday to residents who were startled and confused by hovering helicopters and other loud activity from an early morning military special operations training exercise conducted at a vacant commercial building.\n\nAll seven council members said in a \u201cletter of apology\u201d to residents that use of an automated phone system Friday night \u201cproved ineffective\u201d to provide advance notice of the exercise and that city officials believed the exercise would take place only inside the building.\n\nAccording to the letter, Army officials contacted Ogden police a month ago to request help in finding a suitable location for the exercise.

Stapleton, who has served two terms as the state's treasurer, is facing Democratic U.S. Rep. Jared Polis in the race for the state's top official. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File)\n\nDENVER (AP) \u2014 Republican treasurer Walker Stapleton has attacked his opponent in the race for Colorado governor, Democratic U.S. Rep. Jared Polis, as too radical and extreme for the rapidly growing state as the GOP tries to prevent a complete Democratic takeover of the Statehouse.\n\nStapleton\u2019s repeated criticism of the liberal Polis underscores Republican fears that the party could lose control of the state Senate in Tuesday\u2019s election. The Senate has acted as a check on attempts by the Democratic-led House to restrict gun rights and raise taxes for public schools.\n\n\u201cColorado does not want a socialist for governor,\u201d Stapleton declared when Polis, an advocate of universal health care, campaigned with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders last month.\n\nIn response, Polis cites a high-tech entrepreneurial career that made him wealthy before he entered Congress in 2009 and has let him personally invest more than $22 million in his campaign this year.\n\nPolis and his supporters largely view the race as a referendum on President Donald Trump, whom Stapleton has embraced. Trump\u2019s efforts to dismantle former President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law top the list of issues.\n\n\u201cHealth care is on the ballot. Social Security and Medicare are on the ballot,\u201d Tom Perez, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, told activists while campaigning with Polis at Servicios de la Raza, a Denver community center. \u201cYou need guardrails here in Colorado.\u201d\n\nColorado Republicans haven\u2019t held the governor\u2019s seat since 2007. Early returns suggest Stapleton, 44, is the underdog in an election in which independents, the state\u2019s largest voting bloc, are turning out in high numbers, as they did in Colorado\u2019s Democratic primaries. If elected, Polis, 43, would be Colorado\u2019s first openly gay governor.\n\nA Democratic-controlled Statehouse could move forward on gun regulations, expand public school funding and limit drilling options for Colorado\u2019s $31 billion oil and gas industry \u2014 one that\u2019s prospered under centrist Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper, a former petroleum geologist who is term-limited.\n\nColorado\u2019s Republican-led Senate has forced compromise on those issues. Senate President Kevin Grantham credits that compromise for the state\u2019s fast-growing economy, one of the strongest in the nation.\n\n\u201cThat balance of government is good for predictability and stability and steady sailing for businesses,\u201d Grantham said.\n\nRepublicans have a one-vote Senate edge entering the election. A cluster of races in Denver\u2019s suburbs will determine the outcome, and they have attracted money from the national parties and outside groups.\n\nVoters have been bombarded with daily mailers, television ads, texts and door knocks in targeted races such as Democratic state Rep. Faith Winter\u2019s challenge of Republican state Sen. Beth Martinez Humenik. Democrat Hillary Clinton won the district by 5 percentage points in 2016.\n\nStapleton has attacked Polis\u2019 advocacy of green energy and publicly funded preschool and kindergarten. He defends state constitutional limits on taxes and spending that require voter approval for any tax hike.\n\nAs treasurer, Stapleton worked with both parties to ensure a stable state investment portfolio and to rescue an underfunded state pension fund.\n\nHe claims Polis\u2019 plans for fully funded preschool and kindergarten and universal health care coverage would triple Colorado\u2019s budget \u2014 if Polis could raise the taxes to fund them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a big believer that if you ask people to pay for things, you have to explain how you\u2019re actually going to fund government, health care, transportation,\u201d Stapleton said.\n\nPolis pledges to \u201cbuild coalitions\u201d to fund transportation and schools and promote green energy investment \u2014 suggesting that restrictive tax laws eventually need to change in a state whose population has grown from 4.3 million in 2000 to an estimated 5.7 million this year.\n\nPolis called for restricting access to guns for those in crisis and urged voters to elect a governor who supports abortion rights.\n\nStapleton said he would be a \u201cpro-life governor\u201d who would respect Roe v. Wade as the law of the land but didn\u2019t address during the campaign what he would do if the U.S. Supreme Court were to overturn that ruling.\n\nTrump weighed in Thursday on Twitter, saying Stapleton \u201cwill be an extraordinary Governor for the State of Colorado\u201d and calling Polis \u201cweak on crime and weak on borders \u2014 could never do the job.\u201d\n\nPolis \u2014 who founded high schools for new immigrants and English learners \u2014 cited Trump\u2019s escalating midterm rhetoric about immigration as a critical reason to vote Democratic.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m willing to stand up to this president or any president that tries to profit on division and on fear-mongering,\u201d he told the Servicios de la Raza crowd. \u201cColorado could either elect a Donald Trump \u2018yes man\u2019 as governor or somebody with a track record of creating opportunities for families and bridging the great divides in our state.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Colleen Slevin contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "Police say 5 shootings in South Carolina city are related\n\nSUMTER, S.C.

(AP) \u2014 Demonte Martin wiped the sleepiness from his eyes, stood and began waking up teammates, two of whom were resting on the aisle floor.\n\n\u201cHey, get up, we\u2019re almost home,\u201d the then-junior said to varsity football teammates as Eastern York High School\u2019s charter bus neared its Route 30 eastbound exit.\n\nIt was the 1 o\u2019clock hour, early morning Oct. 28, 2017, the team returning from a game that Friday night in Martinsburg, Blair County, some 130 miles away.\n\nCarl Carbaugh, a senior, had just entered the bathroom at the back of the bus after some good-natured teasing from teammates.\n\nSenior Jahshim Snyder, seated across from junior Drake Brown, had just stood up, too, as Martin and everybody else returned to their seats.\n\nWhat occurred next has been described in myriad ways, including both as a \u201cblur\u201d and as \u201chappening in slow motion,\u201d depending on perspective.\n\nUndeniably, though, the next moments changed countless lives \u2014 and, heartbreakingly, ended another.\n\nA Ford Explorer driven by 23-year-old Jasmine McCarter of York, driving westbound on Route 30 near mile marker 251, swerved to avoid a deer, according to Hellam Township police Chief Doug Pollock.\n\nShe lost control and crossed the median. The eastbound Krapf Bus Company charter driver, according to those on board, noticed the rapidly approaching vehicle with just enough time to turn ever so slightly, but not enough to avoid head-on impact.\n\nThe collision was violent, metal crushing into metal.\n\nSnyder flew forward, caroming across the tops of several bus seats, according to Martin.\n\nThe impact sent Carbaugh barreling out of the bathroom, water and waste splashing about.\n\nHeads of many of the 21 students and four adults on board bounced off the seats in front of them, lips and tongues bloodied by getting chomped between rows of teeth.\n\nThe bus driver, a hero to many on board for maneuvering just enough to keep the charter bus on its wheels, suffered critical injuries but survived.\n\nMcCarter did not, her young, promising life cut short because of multiple blunt force trauma. She was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\n\u201cI was not thinking about it being another human being or another car, especially because we\u2019re going this way and we\u2019re on the highway and there\u2019s a median,\u201d recalled Martin, whose initial thoughts were the bus hit an animal or a tree. \u201cIt just didn\u2019t process right away. It took a minute, and everybody was like, \u2018Holy crap.\u2019\u201d\n\nNearly a year later, the Eastern York community \u2014 members of the football program and beyond \u2014 continues to adjust to memories of that horrific night.\n\n\u201cHorrible things do happen in reality,\u201d Brown said. \u201cYou never really think about it until it actually happens to you, and it\u2019s truly a horrifying thing to witness. And that\u2019s how it is sometimes.\u201d\n\nThe greatest blessing for those associated with the Eastern York football team were, miraculously, no significant physical injuries.\n\nSnyder suffered a mild concussion, a couple of assistant coaches seated at the front of the bus were taken to local hospitals, and there were some cuts and bruises among those on board.\n\n\u201cSeeing the accident scene, it certainly was surprising (no one was seriously injured),\u201d said athletic director Don Knaub, among the first on the scene since he lives just three miles from the site.\n\n\u201cI know they gave a ton of credit to the (bus) driver for his reacting to the car coming across. They credit him for saving a lot.\u201d\n\nRepeated calls and emails to Krapf Transportation out of West Chester for an update on the status of the bus driver were not returned, though safety official Shawn McGlinchey said last year the driver had undergone surgery and was expected to recover.\n\nAnd while the haunting memories of that night will remain for the students, coaches and athletic trainer aboard the bus, as well as the families and coaches following behind in their vehicles, and the other parents and family members receiving 1 a.m. phone calls about the crash, the Eastern York community has done its best to move forward.\n\nClosing the chapter entirely seems a foolish endeavor, and the players, arguably more so than the adults, appear more willing to discuss the events that night and process the feelings that accompany it.\n\n\u201cI really feel more connected with the people who were on that bus with me, and how much closer we were living that moment together,\u201d Brown said alongside Martin and new head coach Josh Campbell, in a sit-down interview with the York Daily Record before the start of the 2018 season.\n\n\u201cYou always have that expectation of what could happen,\u201d Brown continued. \u201cAnytime you feel a sudden stop, or you look around and it\u2019s highly trafficked and you see a fast car go by, you just feel more alert. After you went through it, you know what could happen.\u201d\n\nBrown vividly remembers trying to think and act like a police officer in the aftermath of the crash, as criminal justice is a potential pursuit after high school. His instinct was to make sure teammates and coaches were OK.\n\nMartin, meanwhile, excitedly recalls strangely specific details, which isn\u2019t unusual in the aftermath of traumatic events.\n\nHe remembers the smell from the bathroom spill, the words spoken by Snyder when he first stood up and shook glass out of his hair after his atop-the-seats tumble, the smoke and dirt.\n\nAfter emergency personnel arrived and directed students and coaches out of the bus through back windows \u2014 the front of the bus was so smashed, the usual exit didn\u2019t exist anymore \u2014 Martin realized many of his teammates were staring off in a particular direction.\n\n\u201cAnd I catch myself doing the exact same thing, just sitting there stuck like this,\u201d he said, mimicking a stunned, wide-eyed look. \u201cAnd we see the car, and that was probably the scariest thing.\n\n\u201cIt gave me chills. You ever see in the cartoons, how the junkyard, they squeeze the cars into a little square? Legit, that\u2019s what her car looked like, and it was rough.\u201d\n\nWhat they also remember is the support that was readily made available to them, by parents, by school staff, by the entire Eastern York community.\n\nEven though he wasn\u2019t on the trip, Knaub said being on the scene so soon after the crash still remains \u201cpretty emotional.\u201d He was also so impressed by the kids and coaches on board and their ability to process and discuss the events, to avoid swallowing brutal memories.\n\n\u201cOur kids are resilient; kids in general are resilient,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s emotional thinking of what could have been. But quite honestly, our kids handled it really well. Very mature about it, asked great questions, open and honest with how they\u2019re feeling, and I think that really had a lot to do with how they got through it.\u201d\n\nCampbell, previously an assistant coach in 2014 and also a sixth-grade teacher at Eastern York Middle School, was named head coach in January.\n\nHe learned of the accident later on the morning it happened.\n\n\u201cIn a situation like that, you don\u2019t necessarily know how you\u2019ll react,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cYou may have a plan of action, but until you\u2019re in that situation \u2014 until something is actually occurring \u2014 you don\u2019t necessarily know how it will be handled. And I think the boys were very admirable.\u201d\n\nThe team often thinks about McCarter, a York County School of Technology graduate who had earned her master\u2019s degree and was teaching students at Crispus Attucks Association of York, and the bus driver. They\u2019ve sent flowers and prayers, donating money to Crispus Attucks in McCarter\u2019s honor.\n\n\u201cShe lives in our hearts every day, and we all miss her so much,\u201d McCarter\u2019s aunt, Jennifer Murray, wrote to the YDR recently on behalf of her family. \u201cIn her short time here, she made a tremendous impact and was a remarkable daughter, sister, granddaughter, niece, aunt, cousin, dear friend and mentor, and loving caregiver to numerous pets.\n\n\u201cOur heartfelt consolation (is) that no Eastern varsity football player/student was taken from life on the bus that Jasmine\u2019s vehicle made contact with, nor any of the adults, coaches and driver.

The bear was safely rescued by Kalispell Police, Flahtead County Sheriff's Office Animal Control, Kalispell Fire, and Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks. At least seven calls came into the the 911 Call Center with reports of the bear in the Three Mile Drive area and in the community garden. (Brenda Ahearn/The Daily Inter Lake via AP)\n\nKALISPELL, Mont. (AP) \u2014 Erik Wenum is known as the \u201cbear guy,\u201d and it\u2019s an apt moniker, given the fact that he\u2019s handled nearly 5,000 bears during his tenure with Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks.\n\nHe\u2019s the bear and mountain lion specialist for the state agency, but truth is, there just isn\u2019t enough space on his business card to provide a simplified description of the work he does.\n\nWenum, 56, has been working with large mammals for more than 30 years, including 28 with Fish, Wildlife and Parks. He earned his degree at Colorado State and studied deer in that state before moving to Montana to get his master\u2019s degree at Montana State University. He began working for Fish, Wildlife and Parks in its South Fork grizzly research project before becoming its bear and mountain lion specialist.\n\nMost of his experiences have been with bears, mountain lions and people, but he also has handled scores of incidents involving deer, elk, moose and wolves.\n\nHe has trapped and relocated black and grizzly bears, re-denned orphaned bear cubs, euthanized bears that were deemed a threat to people, removed baling twine from the antlers of a white-tailed deer, removed a volleyball net from the antlers of a young bull moose at Bitterroot Lake and relocated a moose that had taken up residence at the Whitefish Lake Golf Course.\n\nFWP Region 1 Supervisor Jim Williams has high praise for Wenum.\n\n\u201cErik is probably one of the best biologists working under pressure with local, county, state and federal agencies in terms of wildlife and human conflicts,\u201d Williams said. \u201cHe\u2019s calm, cool and collected. He is uniquely qualified for his position.\u201d\n\nWilliams said when Wenum arrived, mountain lion conflicts were rapidly increasing in the Flathead Valley.\n\n\u201cOne of our biologists, Shawn Riley, created the zone management program for lions and Erik was front and center in dealing with those conflicts,\u201d Williams said. \u201cErik worked with a lot of lions and he was probably the first in the country to work on those conflicts, teaching urban and rural communities to live with mountain lions.\n\n\u201cOther countries in South America and states here in the U.S. have modeled their lion programs after what Erik has done here,\u201d Williams added.\n\n\u201cThe big down side for him is that he is the only conflict specialist for the region, so he has to prioritize the calls he receives \u2014 which are many \u2014 and we have to make sure he gets a day off now and then.\u201d\n\nWenum also has had to investigate fatal bear maulings, including one of a close friend, FWP Game Warden Brad Treat, that occurred about two years ago on the Green Gate Trail network between Coram and West Glacier, when Treat collided with a grizzly while mountain biking.\n\n\u201cThat is the unfortunate side of the job, but those are the risks and hazards you have to deal with at times,\u201d he said.\n\nFor Wenum, the list of animals he has worked with seems endless.\n\n\u201cI have trapped and handled every species of large mammal in North America with the exception of polar bear, musk ox and caribou, but they are on my bucket list,\u201d Wenum told the Daily Inter Lake.\n\nOne moose encounter, he recalled, became a little sloppy when it vomited all over him. Wenum had responded to a Columbia Falls residence because a cow with a calf refused to allow a man to leave his home.\n\n\u201cShe and the calf had taken up residence in his yard and whenever he\u2019d try to leave to go to work, she\u2019d charge right up to the deck, so he was pretty scared to go to work,\u201d Wenum said.\n\nWhen he responded to the home, he didn\u2019t initially see either moose, but after the man safely made his way to his vehicle, Wenum found the cow and calf behind the home. He then utilized an innovative approach to try and get them to leave.\n\n\u201cI hit her with a snowball and she didn\u2019t react, so I beaned the calf. When it made a noise, the cow charged me,\u201d Wenum said.\n\nHe ducked behind a tree, but she curled her head around it and threw up all over his face and chest.\n\n\u201cI walked back to my truck wiping stuff off my face and clothes,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was really pleasant,\u201d he said with a sarcastic chuckle.\n\nWenum also has developed an international reputation as one of the leading authorities on bears.\n\nAs a member of the Wildlife Human Attack Response Team, Wenum helps lead investigations that typically involve bears and people.\n\nHe and FWP Regional Investigator Brian Sommers have traveled to several states and Canadian provinces at the requests of state fish-and-game agencies, teaching their personnel how to develop their teams and protocols and how to conduct these types of investigations. They also consult with states on mauling incidents.\n\nBut for all of his experiences and credentials, Wenum\u2019s biggest frustrations involve the interactions with wildlife and people.\n\n\u201cWe have a very large bear population here in Northwest Montana,\u201d Wenum stressed. \u201cThere are up to 1,200 grizzlies and the black bear population has always been robust. There is great habitat for them here, but the human population has rapidly expanded here in the last 20 years and the turnover of people is very high. So it seems like we are always educating people about how to limit wildlife encounters.\u201d\n\nWenum\u2019s work with bears has been the most captivating for him.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve learned a great deal about bears and most of the attacks or incidents, we know what triggers them,\u201d Wenum said. \u201cWhether it\u2019s a surprise encounter or in defense of a cub or food, we understand why they happen.\n\n\u201cBut every so often, we hear about one that just doesn\u2019t add up. We had one where a male grizzly circled a group of people in Glacier (National Park) and then charged into it and knocked one guy down before it retreated.\n\n\u201cThe people hadn\u2019t done anything to provoke it, but there was no obvious reason why it did what it did and why it homed in on the one guy,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI always said I\u2019d like to sit down and buy a bear a beer to get a better understanding of what makes them tick,\u201d he added.\n\nHe also said more people raising chickens in their backyards has increased the number of bear calls.\n\n\u201cWe really can\u2019t be surprised with the conflicts with so many food sources available to predators,\u201d Wenum said. \u201cThe population has grown dramatically and more people are living in areas where bears have traditionally been and you add chickens, gardens, pet food that isn\u2019t secured, there are going to be conflicts.\u201d\n\nConflicts have kept Wenum and others with Fish, Wildlife and Parks busy giving programs to school students and community groups.\n\n\u201cWe push the information and education side pretty hard so people know what\u2019s going on and how they deal with it best,\u201d Wenum said. \u201cPeople are starting to get a better idea of what is living in and around their homes because so many are putting up game cameras.\u201d\n\nDespite some of the frustrations of the job, Wenum said his work is extremely satisfying.\n\n\u201cI spend about 90 percent of my time working outside, I have a lot of freedom in my work and I get to work with a phenomenal group of people that are single-minded in the goals of resource management and protection,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Daily Inter Lake, http://www.dailyinterlake.com", "More than a farm: Old Friends gives new life to racehorses\n\nFILE - In this April 6, 2004 file photo, Michael Blowen prepares to take Rich in Dallas out of his stall on Afton farm near Midway, Ky., Rich in Dallas was one of the horses that played Seabiscuit in the film of the same title. Blowen is the founder of Old Friends, a new nonprofit organization devoted to providing a retirement home for thoroughbred stallions and other racehorses when their careers have ended. (AP Photo/James Crisp, File)\n\nGEORGETOWN, Ky. (AP) \u2014 It\u2019s been more than 20 years since Michael Blowen sat down to chat it up with Hollywood A-listers like actor Jack Nicholson, but the effect celebrities have on their fans is still fresh on his mind.\n\n\u201cI know how excited people get when they see a movie star,\u201d said Blowen, remembering his time as an entertainment reporter at The Boston Globe. \u201cIt\u2019s the same way I feel when I see a famous racehorse and I figured I can\u2019t be the only person who feels this way.\u201d\n\nConcerned about the welfare of ex-racehorses, Blowen figured he could use \u201ccelebrity\u201d to provide a dignified retirement not only for well-known thoroughbreds like the winners of Breeders\u2019 Cup, Kentucky Derby, Preakness and Belmont Stakes, but also for their less popular competitors.\n\nThat\u2019s how Old Friends Thoroughbred Retirement Farm, located in the idyllic Georgetown, Kentucky, was born.\n\n\u201cFor every famous horse we get \u2014 like Silver Charm, War Emblem or Alphabet Soup \u2014 we try to retire another one who isn\u2019t as well known,\u201d said Blowen, president of Old Friends Thoroughbred Retirement Farm. \u201cI think the key to this whole place is making sure these animals can still generate income once their racing and breeding careers are over.\u201d\n\nOld Friends provides a \u201cdignified retirement to thoroughbreds whose racing and breeding careers have come to an end,\u201d according to Blowen. By promoting \u201cthese one-time celebrated horses through a campaign of education and tourism, we hope to raise awareness of all equines in need,\u201d Old Friends\u2019 website states.\n\nSo far, the farm has been a success. It\u2019s easy for horse fans to become starstruck when greeted at a pasture fence by Amazombie, the winner of the Breeders\u2019 Cup sprint in 2011 or when they catch a glimpse of 2012 Breeders\u2019 Cup Turf winner Little Mike galloping around a lush field.\n\n\u201cHe was arguably the best horse in the world at longer distances on the turf in 2012,\u201d Blowen said of Little Mike.\n\nVisitors pay $10 apiece to meet these heroes of the horse world. Just a few steps from Blowen\u2019s back door, Alphabet Soup, the winner of the $6 million winner Breeders\u2019 Cup Classic in 1996, scratches his back by rolling in a patch of dirt. In the next pasture, feisty War Emblem \u2014 a Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner \u2014 races along the fence hoping to attract enough attention to win a fist full of carrots.\n\nIn 2003, the equine elder care facility was still just an idea and consisted of a leased paddock with one lone horse. Today, Old Friends Thoroughbred Retirement Farms has grown into a 136-acre farm with a herd of 126 rescued and retired horses, and two satellite facilities: Old Friends at Cabin Creek in Greenfield Center, New York and Old Friends at Kentucky Downs in Franklin, Kentucky.\n\nThe main farm is staffed by eight employees and dozens of volunteers. From veterinarian care to fencing, donations keep the farm and its mission afloat. Blowen and his wife Diane White, also a former Boston Globe columnist, generate donations through fundraising events and some from private donors, including a few of Blowen\u2019s former interview subjects like actors Angie Dickinson and Jack Nicholson.\n\nBlowen has built a benevolent reputation in the equine world. Horse owners reach out to Old Friends when they are ready to retire a beloved racehorse. Jockeys like Chris McCarron, who rode Alphabet Soup in a stunning victory over favorite Cigar in the 1996 Breeders\u2019 Cup Classic, stops by on occasion to visit his famous ride.\n\nAnd he\u2019s not alone. Each year, more than 20,000 visitors make the trip to the living history museum to feed a few carrots to some of the most successful racehorses of all time.\n\n\u201cWhen they are working (as racehorses) their lives are stressful, they\u2019re kept in stalls and trained like athletes,\u201d Blowen said as he walks along a gravel driveway carrying a black plastic bucket filled with carrots.\n\n\u201cHere, they get to be horses again. They hang out with (other racehorses) in wide-open pastures and sometimes we see them take off through the field and race each other with no jockey, no betting, no pressures,\u201d he said. \u201cJust living like horses.\u201d\n\nThe relaxed lifestyle agrees with the aging residents. Alphabet Soup, who is now 27 years old, is a gentle stallion who spends his days with his favorite companion, a 9-year-old donkey named Gorgeous George.\n\n\u201cThey are never apart,\u201d Blowen said. \u201cWhen we take Alfie (nickname for Alphabet Soup) out of his stall to the pasture, George trots right along behind him. They keep each other company and are the best of friends.\u201d\n\nThe former newspaperman currently has five Breeders\u2019 Cup winners living at his farm \u2014 Little Mike, Amazombie, Eldaafer, Alphabet Soup and Cajun Beat. Each horse has his own distinct personality but the winners all share a common trait.\n\nThey\u2019re all incredibly smart.\n\n\u201cThe ones that raced the Breeders\u2019 Cup are all smarter than everybody else. They know more about how to be racehorses, they know that it\u2019s more than just running around in a circle \u2014 there is strategy involved,\u201d Blowen said. \u201cThe good ones are playing chess while the others are playing checkers.\u201d\n\nOnce lightning-fast superstars, these four-legged athletes may be past their prime but they have found their \u2018Old Kentucky Home\u2019 and a dignified retirement thanks to this former reporter and equine fan.\n\nWith only a few carrots remaining at the bottom of his bucket, Blowen steps up to the pasture occupied by War Emblem. Suddenly like a couple of school-age kids, Blowen breaks into a sprint next to the former Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner.\n\nLaughing as he runs, Blowen taunts the handsome, nearly black racehorse. \u201cCome on, come on! Catch me, catch me!\u201d\n\nWhich of course, War Emblem does. He then bucks his hind legs as if to say, \u201chey old man, this game is done.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Courier Journal, http://www.courier-journal.com", "Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan addresses supporters at the parliament, in Ankara, Tuesday, Oct. 30, 2018.

He and his partners investigate and perform \u201csite clearings\u201d of homes and businesses within a 100-mile radius of Memphis.\n\nThey don\u2019t charge, instead suggesting those they assist donate to St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital.\n\nIt\u2019s a field replete with skeptics whose confidences are harder to win over than the spirits Williams tries to coax out of the places they inhabit. But, Williams insists, what he does is no joke.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t worry about those who don\u2019t take it seriously,\u201d Williams said. \u201cWhen people contact us, they\u2019re scared and sometimes they have kids who are scared. We want to do what we can to help.\u201d\n\nSo forget the \u201cGhostbusters\u201d references and the religious critics who believe he\u2019s dabbling in satanic realms. Williams said there\u2019s a science behind it, electromagnetic forces that can be detected with sensitive equipment.\n\n\u201cThe theory is that when a person ceases to exist, the energy still exists,\u201d Williams said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s an intelligence to the energy. Think of it like radio waves that go through the air.\u201d\n\nWilliams said his associates have \u201calmost built-in receivers\u201d that can detect the energy.\n\nThe Memphis Ghost website gives biographies for an \u201cintuitive investigator\u201d and three \u201cspiritual mediums\u201d who assist with investigations. They\u2019re identified by first names only, but Williams -- who can be contacted at 901-877-8406 or at info@memphisghostinvestigations.com -- agreed to be identified fully.\n\nIt all grew from that St. Augustine visit more than 15 years ago, when a photo came back with a mysterious glowing circle, or \u201cspirit energy orb.\u201d\n\n\u201cTwo months earlier,\u201d according to the caption on the Memphis Ghost website for a photo of the cafe where the orb was photographed, \u201cStephen had witnessed an incredible display of EMF equipment interaction at this site with a female child spirit named Alice who was well known to local residents through numerous sightings at this house.\u201d\n\nWilliams came back home and began doing home investigations with the pair of women who helped him interpret his St. Augustine experiences. Their group morphed into Memphis-Midsouth Ghost Hunters.\n\n\u201cI ran that group for a long time, then took a break about a year ago,\u201d Williams said. \u201cNow we\u2019re back doing this kind of work again.\u201d\n\nInvestigations have taken Williams across the South \u2014 from a cemetery in Brighton, where a photograph captured an \u201cenergy mist,\u201d to an antebellum home near Plains, Georgia, (once rented by former President Jimmy Carter and former first lady Rosalyn Carter) that was hopping with paranormal activity.\n\nCloser to home, Williams said he\u2019s participated in paranormal investigations at the Woodruff-Fontaine House at 680 Adams and at The Orpheum. He also lists on his website a testimonial from Frances P., a Germantown homeowner who says Williams helped a troubled spirit \u201ccross over\u201d from her home.\n\nWilliams declined to identify Frances P. by full name or to provide contact information, saying he respects the privacy requested by most clients.\n\nIn the online testimonial, Frances says:\n\n\u201cStephen was referred to me after a friend learned of a spirit in my home. After walking through each room in the house, Stephen stopped and asked if the spirit was most active where he was standing. He was spot on! He had physically felt the spirit\u2019s presence. Stephen then retraced his steps throughout the house carrying an instrument, and when he reached \u2018the spot\u2019 again, the instrument increased in activity. Stephen said he believed it was a male spirit who had passed before his wife. I was blown away! My neighbors had shared this with me about the previous owners of the house. Stephen then guided the spirit to cross over in a very gentle and respectful manner. Our home took on a light and fresh energy through Stephen\u2019s gift. Thank you, Stephen!\u201d\n\nWilliams describes himself as a Christian, though he says he hasn\u2019t asked his colleagues about their religious beliefs which he considers personal.\n\nWilliams cites a biblical reference from 1 Corinthians to support what he describes as a spiritual gift that allows him to distinguish between spirits:\n\n\u201c7 Now to each one the manifestation of the Spirit is given for the common good, 8 To one there is given through the Spirit a message of wisdom, to another a message of knowledge by means of the same Spirit, 9 to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healing by that one Spirit, 10 to another miraculous powers, to another prophecy, to another distinguishing between spirits, to another speaking in different kinds of tongues, and to still another the interpretation of tongues.\u201d\n\nBut not everyone is convinced that Williams and others like him are finding anything otherworldly.\n\nBenjamin Radford, an investigator of ghosts and the paranormal, wrote for the Live Science website more than a decade ago, shortly after Williams\u2019 paranormal adventures began, that the science is questionable, to say the least.\n\n\u201cGhosts are big business,\u201d Radford wrote in 2006. \u201cFor entities that may or may not exist, they seem to be everywhere, especially during Halloween.\u201d\n\nRadford said ghost hunters use high-tech equipment, such as electromagnetic field (EMF) detectors, to give themselves the appearance of authority. But in the end, he added, \u201cthe equipment is only as scientific as the person using it; you may own the world\u2019s most sophisticated thermometer, but if you are using it as a barometer, your measurements are worthless.\u201d\n\nOr, to put it another way, said Radford: \u201cJust as using a calculator doesn\u2019t make you a mathematician, using a scientific instrument doesn\u2019t make you a scientist.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf ghosts exist,\u201d asked Radford, \u201cwhy are we no closer to finding out what they really are, after so much research?\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Commercial Appeal, http://www.commercialappeal.com", "JESSUP, Md.

Heitkamp attended several events during the campaign season in the Fargo area, where she won by a large margin in 2012 to upset Republican Rick Berg. Heitkamp is running against Republican Rep. Kevin Cramer this time. (AP Photo/Dave Kolpack)\n\nFARGO, N.D. (AP) \u2014 When Sen. Heidi Heitkamp was choosing her campaign headquarters, Fargo was the obvious choice. She grew up in the area, it\u2019s nearly twice as large as any other North Dakota city and it\u2019s the biggest potential source of liberal-minded voters in the strongly conservative state.\n\nThe Democrat\u2019s chances to win a second term by defeating Republican challenger Kevin Cramer likely rest on her ability to pile up huge margins in Fargo. It\u2019s why her barnstorming \u201cBring It Home Heidi\u201d statewide bus tour in the final days was set to end Monday right back on home turf.\n\n\u201cObviously I do better in Fargo. This is where I\u2019m from,\u201d said Heitkamp, who grew up in tiny Mantador, 50 miles (80 kilometers) to the south.\n\nHeading into the final weekend of the campaign, Heitkamp was widely seen as trailing Cramer in a race Democrats were desperate to hold for any chance at taking control of the Senate. Former Vice President Joe Biden helped kick off the bus tour in Fargo on Thursday, urging voters to turn out.\n\nIn winning her first term six years ago, Heitkamp led Republican Rick Berg by nearly 10,000 in Cass County, which includes Fargo. She won by just 3,000 votes. Her campaign has said its internal polling shows her doing even better there this year, but officials declined to provide specific numbers they think she\u2019d need to defeat Cramer.\n\nThe huge cache of votes in Fargo and Cass County isn\u2019t something the Cramer campaign is prepared to concede. Though Cramer\u2019s strength is in the more rural west of the state, he has made multiple stops in the Fargo area and was scheduled to tailgate in the city Saturday before North Dakota State\u2019s football game.\n\nFargo is more diverse and younger than the rest of North Dakota, with the university\u2019s roughly 14,000 students and a diversified economy. Cass County has grown by about 21,000 people since Heitkamp\u2019s 2012 victory \u2014 growth largely paralleled in the oil-producing west by thousands of mostly conservative-leaning workers \u2014 and now has nearly one-fourth of the state\u2019s population. Most is in the cities of Fargo and West Fargo.\n\nA sprawling Microsoft campus employs about 1,700 workers, including many from abroad, and newer tech startups have popped up. In a city once best known for the Coen brothers\u2019 movie of the same name, Fargo\u2019s flourishing downtown now features many chic restaurants, shops, art galleries and hotels.\n\n\u201cPeople are starting to choose Fargo and then they are finding opportunities here,\u201d said Greg Tehven, executive director of Emerging Prairie, a nonprofit that provides assistance to young entrepreneurs. \u201cMore and more young folks that are creative and solutions-oriented are making this place home and continue to add to the social and creative fabric.\u201d\n\nHeitkamp\u2019s campaign manager, Libby Schneider, said they have focused on college students, young families and new immigrants, which is the fastest-growing group in Fargo. To that end, Heitkamp events this year have ranged from hanging out at the Red River Valley Fair, speaking at a new Americans rally, talking with North Dakota State University\u2019s Young Democrats and participating in Fargo\u2019s gay pride parade.\n\nAlthough Fargo is North Dakota\u2019s most liberal city, Cass County voters went decidedly for Donald Trump just two years ago. And not all of the younger downtowners are Democrats.\n\nNathan Joraanstad, who helped his brother start tech firm Myriad Mobile, is a Republican backing Cramer. He acknowledges that some Fargo residents might be more \u201cliberal-minded,\u201d particularly in downtown, but the fact that Trump carried Cass County shows that \u201ceither the demographics have changed or people\u2019s mindsets have changed.\u201d\n\nCramer said he didn\u2019t view any city in the state as more or less important to his campaign.\n\n\u201cEvery North Dakotan counts the same as every other,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nFollow Dave Kolpack on Twitter: https://twitter.com/\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "FILE - In this Wednesday, Oct. 17, 2018 file photo, Ireland's Prime Minister Leo Varadkar arrives for a meeting of the European People's Party EPP in Brussels, Belgium, as European leaders meet to negotiate on terms of Britain's divorce from the European Union.

But they haven\u2019t agreed on how to guarantee that \u2014 and Britain is due to leave the bloc on March 29.\n\nThe border impasse has heightened fears that the U.K. might crash out of the EU without a deal on divorce terms and future relations, leading to chaos at ports and economic turmoil.\n\nThe EU has proposed keeping Northern Ireland inside a customs union with the bloc to remove the need for border checks on the island.\n\nBut Britain\u2019s Conservative government and its Northern Irish ally, the Democratic Unionist Party, won\u2019t accept that because it would mean customs and regulatory checks between Northern Ireland and the rest of the U.K.\n\nBritain wants instead to keep the whole U.K. in an EU customs union, but only temporarily.\n\nAlthough there has been no outward sign of a Brexit breakthrough, Irish and British officials say they are increasingly optimistic that a solution can be found.\n\nAfter meeting Friday with Irish Deputy Prime Minister Simon Coveney in Dublin, British Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s deputy David Lidington said negotiators were \u201cvery close\u201d to an agreement.\n\nCoveney agreed there had been \u201ca lot of progress.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it is possible to get a deal in November,\u201d he said.", "BISMARCK, N.D.

And billionaires like California liberal Tom Steyer, Republican casino magnate Sheldon Adelson and the conservative Koch brothers have all picked a side.\n\nThe state\u2019s outgoing Gov. Brian Sandoval, a moderate Republican, has stayed out of the fray. He declined to endorse Laxalt, who said he wants to repeal a commerce tax on businesses that Sandoval pushed through in 2015 to boost public education by millions.\n\nEven members of Laxalt\u2019s prominent family are divided on the race.\n\nLast month, a dozen members of the Laxalt family authored an opinion column in the Reno Gazette Journal declaring their relative to be the wrong choice for governor. A day later, 22 supportive family members responded with their own column.\n\nLaxalt, who was first elected to office in 2014, is the son of former U.S. Sen. Pete Domenici of New Mexico and the grandson of former Nevada governor and U.S. Sen. Paul Laxalt, a figure who looms large in Nevada politics\n\nThe central theme of the Republican\u2019s campaign has been a promise to keep the state from resembling its liberal neighbor California by opposing higher taxes and more regulations.\n\n\u201cWhat would Nevada look like if my opponent becomes governor of this state?\u201d Laxalt asked attendees last weekend at a Carson City rally with Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nThe crowd responded: \u201cCalifornia!\u201d\n\nSisolak, his opponent, chairs the Clark County Commission overseeing the Las Vegas Strip and became a visible figure following last year\u2019s mass shooting at a country music festival. He also played a key role in the plan to build a new NFL stadium in Las Vegas for the Oakland Raiders that\u2019s funded by a hotel room tax.\n\nHe\u2019s also has pledged to stand up to Trump and the National Rifle Association while defending Planned Parenthood and the state\u2019s Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nLaxalt has NRA backing, has said he opposed the state\u2019s Medicaid expansion and would look to add work requirements to it, and has had his office file legal briefs supporting abortion restrictions in other states.\n\n\u201cAdam Laxalt used the office of the attorney general to eliminate women\u2019s reproductive rights across this country,\u201d Sisolak said at a rally last month. \u201cAnd he\u2019s been silent as his buddies in the Trump administration erode our families\u2019 access to health care.\u201d\n\nSisolak\u2019s campaign has backing from former longtime U.S. Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada and the Democratic political machine that Reid built, which has meticulously tracked Laxalt\u2019s moves and missteps.\n\nIn turn, Laxalt\u2019s campaign coined a Trump-esque nickname for Sisolak, \u201cShady Steve,\u201d and launched their own website detailing votes he cast that benefited donors and allies.\n\nDemocrats on Tuesday will be counting on Sisolak\u2019s Clark County base and enough Democratic support in the Reno area to pull off a win, while Republicans will be counting on Laxalt\u2019s appeal to conservatives and northern Nevadans.\n\nOne wild card will be independent candidate Ryan Bundy, the son of rancher Cliven Bundy who was involved in two armed standoffs with federal agents. Ryan Bundy\u2019s appeal to the state\u2019s rural residents and ranchers could siphon off enough votes from Laxalt to make a difference in the tight race.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "FILE - This combination of file photos shows Kansas gubernatorial candidates in the November 2018 election from left: Republican Secretary of State Kris Kobach; Democratic state Sen. Laura Kelly; and Independent candidate, businessmen Greg Orman. (Thad Allton/The Topeka Capital-Journal via AP, File)\n\nTOPEKA, Kan. (AP) \u2014 Democrats in Kansas who have had to sit on the political sidelines for the better part of a decade are hoping for a blue wave on Election Day that could help them break the Republican grip on power and are optimistic about their chances in several races, including the one for governor.\n\nKansas is a virtual lock for the GOP nominee in presidential races. President Donald Trump won the state two years ago by nearly 21 percentage points, and the last Democratic presidential candidate to carry it was Lyndon Johnson in 1964. Kansas last elected a Democrat to the U.S. Senate in 1932, and Republicans are close to a 2-to-1 advantage among registered voters.\n\nYet a purple streak runs through the state because of decades of infighting within the dominant Republican Party. In the past 50 years, the state has had five Republican and five Democratic governors.\n\nChris Reeves, a Democratic National Committee member from the Kansas City area, said 2018 was \u201ca year that was really set up for us,\u201d with energy high and many Democratic candidates outpacing GOP foes in fundraising.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s say everything goes wrong,\u201d Reeves said. \u201cI think what it causes us to do is to say, \u2018You know what? We needed a lot more legwork from the spring on, in registering new voters.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe marquee race for governor between conservative Republican Kris Kobach and Democrat Laura Kelly was a toss-up in the campaign\u2019s final weekend. Kelly is wooing GOP moderates who are put off by Kobach\u2019s hardline stances on issues such as immigration, while Kobach expects his conservative base to turn out to counter enthusiasm on the left.\n\nWhile Trump won the state handily, he narrowly lost the Kansas City-area congressional district of GOP Rep. Kevin Yoder, who is now in danger of losing his seat because suburban voters have turned against the president.\n\nDemocrats also hope to flip the open seat in a neighboring eastern Kansas district where Republicans are suffering from their perennial problem of internal dissension. A political novice emerged from a crowded Republican primary and is struggling to unite the party behind him.\n\nThe state GOP\u2019s goal is to wash out any purple to make Kansas like other states that haven\u2019t elected a Democratic governor in more than 20 years, such as Idaho, South Dakota, Texas or Utah. Kansas Republicans started their latest streak with a clean sweep of statewide and congressional races in 2010, riding a wave of tea party opposition to President Barack Obama.\n\nIn 1994, in a GOP-wave year nationally, Republicans swept all of those races except one, state insurance commissioner. After winning that down-ballot race, Democrat Kathleen Sebelius built a political profile that allowed her to win two terms as governor.\n\nState GOP Chairman Kelly Arnold said that if Republicans manage another sweep this year, \u201cWe have basically eliminated the Democrat bench.\u201d\n\nKobach, the Kansas secretary of state, is Trump\u2019s closest political ally in the state. He advocates tough state policies against immigration and promises to shrink state government so that Kansas can return to cutting taxes.\n\nHe\u2019s battling the ill-feelings left over from former Republican Gov. Sam Brownback\u2019s experiment in cutting income taxes in 2012-13 and ensuing budget problems that prompted even some national Republicans to label the effort a failure. Legislators reversed most of the tax cuts in 2017, and Kelly, a veteran state senator from Topeka, argues that Kobach\u2019s election would end a nascent fiscal recovery.\n\nIndependent candidate Greg Orman, a Kansas City area businessman, trails far behind Kelly and Kobach but could be a spoiler helping Kobach.\n\nKansas House Minority Leader Jim Ward, a Wichita Democrat, argues that if Kobach is elected, his conservative politics will make him a foil that helps Democrats recruit candidates. And, with the excitement this year, \u201cThat energy doesn\u2019t go away.\u201d\n\nDuring a recent get-out-the-vote rally in Topeka, Kobach described the governor\u2019s race as \u201csuper-close.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a situation where every phone call you make counts,\u201d he told fellow Republicans. \u201cEvery text message you send counts.\u201d\n\nThe race for the eastern Kansas open seat also is extremely close. It features Democrat Paul Davis, who narrowly lost to Brownback in a run for governor four years ago, and Republican Steve Watkins, an ex-Army officer and government contractor. They\u2019re running to replace retiring Republican Rep. Lynn Jenkins.\n\nWatkins, a political newcomer, has been caught inflating parts of his biography , but Trump carried the GOP-leaning district by 17 percentage points, and the GOP is hungry to keep the seat.\n\nDemocrats are more confident of picking up the Kansas City-area seat, where Yoder is struggling to win a fifth term. Democrat Sharice Davids has gained national attention because she\u2019s LGBT and Native American.\n\nPatrick Miller, a University of Kansas political scientist, said losing all three big races would be a big blow to Democrats\u2019 morale. But he discounts the idea of a long-term political exile for them because, \u201ctwo years, four years, from now, it\u2019s a different political context.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are states in this country, sometimes they go decades without electing a governor of a certain party, and that party that keeps losing, they nominate awful candidates,\u201d Miller said. \u201cBut then the right electoral circumstances happen, and, bam!\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow John Hanna on Twitter: https://twitter.com/apjdhanna\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "RICHMOND, R.I.

(AP Photo/Vadim Ghirda)\n\nDOHA, Qatar (AP) \u2014 Simone Biles returned to training last November wondering if she could ever return to the form that made her an Olympic champion.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t wonder anymore. Neither does anyone else.\n\nThe American star capped a remarkable 2018 world gymnastics championships by claiming gold on floor exercise and bronze on balance beam during event finals Saturday, giving her six medals for the meet and 20 overall in the world championships, tied with Russia\u2019s Svetlana Khorkina for the most by a female gymnast.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot to be proud, but I\u2019m most proud of that I\u2019m here, I made all the event finals, medaled in all of the events and I survived,\u201d Biles said.\n\nSomething that wasn\u2019t a guarantee when the meet began. Biles spent the night before qualifying in the hospital dealing with pain from a kidney stone. The stone was too big to pass and she couldn\u2019t take prescription pain medication because of doping regulations, forcing her to simply deal with it.\n\nBiles did more than deal with it. She dominated. Just like always.\n\nThe 21-year-old will head home to Houston with gold medals from the team final, the all-around final, floor and vault as well as silver on uneven bars and bronze on beam. She became the first woman to earn a medal on all four events since Yelena Shushunova did it for the Soviet Union in 1987.\n\nBiles believes it\u2019s just the beginning. She\u2019ll visit with doctors to treat the kidney stone, go on a short vacation and then point toward 2019.\n\n\u201cHopefully I feel more confident next year going into all of the events,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see about upgrades. I\u2019m not sure. We\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nBiles finished a busy 10 days by drilling her floor routine, which includes intricate tumbling runs that are as difficult as anything done by the men these days. Though she stepped out of bounds on her third pass, her score of 14.933 was a full point better than that of teammate Morgan Hurd, who earned her third medal of the meet by finishing with silver. Japan\u2019s Mai Murakami took third.\n\nBiles wasn\u2019t quite as crisp on beam, an event that she\u2019s struggled with recently. She wobbled during qualifying and fell off during the all-around finals. Though she managed to stay on during event finals, she found herself off balance on multiple occasions. Her score of 13.6 held up for bronze behind China\u2019s Liu Tingting and Canada\u2019s Ana Padurariu.\n\nWhile allowing it wasn\u2019t her best, Biles took to Twitter in between beam and floor exercise to chastise those who criticized her for not winning gold. It\u2019s a move she felt was necessary.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s upsetting to me whenever I see all the tweets after I do performances of how disappointed they are in me,\u201d Biles said. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair because they can\u2019t set expectations on me. I have to set them for myself.\u201d\n\nAnd no one\u2019s expectations are higher. Biles took herself to task after the all-around, unhappy with a series of uncharacteristic mistakes. She vowed to redeem herself in the event finals and responded by reaching the podium on each event.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really happy to be done,\u201d Biles said. \u201cProud of my performances here. I wish some of them would have been better but I\u2019m really proud of the outcome.\u201d\n\nSo was Hurd, who won a team gold, bronze in the all-around and silver on floor, validating her breakthrough performance at the 2017 world championships when she became an unlikely champion.\n\n\u201cOh, I wanted it so badly,\u201d Hurd said. \u201cNow I\u2019ve got a full set.\u201d\n\nFive-time U.S. champion and two-time Olympian Sam Mikulak picked up the first world championship medal of his career when he finished third in the high bar final behind Epke Zonderland of the Netherlands and Japan\u2019s Kohei Uchimura, who boosted his career medal at worlds to 21.\n\nMikulak will settle with having just one for now.\n\n\u201cI made a statement to the world that Sam isn\u2019t some washed-out gymnast that\u2019s holding on,\u201d the 26-year-old Mikulak said. \u201cHe\u2019s here to play and he\u2019s here to get medals.\u201d\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s Ri Se Gwang picked up his third world title on vault. Men\u2019s all-around champion Artur Dalaloyan earned silver, with Japan\u2019s Kenzo Shirai taking bronze. China\u2019s Zou Jingyuan captured gold on parallel bars with a score of 16.433 \u2014 the highest on any apparatus by a man during the meet \u2014 while Oleg Verniaiev took silver and Dalaloyan bronze.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sport and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "In this Oct. 25, 2018 photo, Virginia Senate candidate Corey Stewart speaks with members of the Virginia Deer Hunters Association in Chesterfield County, Va.

Republicans openly worry Stewart will hurt down-ballot candidates facing stiff competition in several Virginia congressional districts as Democrats try to take control of the U.S. House.\n\n\u201cWithout a lot of top-of-the-ticket support, these congressional candidates have really got to grind it out,\u201d former White House adviser Steve Bannon recently told a local talk radio host.\n\nStewart\u2019s devotion to Trump has gotten little in return from the White House. Vice President Mike Pence recently campaigned for a little-known, longshot Virginia congressional candidate in a heavily Democratic district, but has done no events with Stewart.\n\nOn top of it all, Stewart said he recently lost a major client at his international trade law firm because of the campaign.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve lost a lot of money because of this,\u201d Stewart said in an interview, adding he\u2019ll be facing \u201csome painful years\u201d if he loses.\n\nStewart declined to name the client or the reason why the client left, but the immigration hardliner and outspoken advocate of Confederate imagery has been a magnet for controversy.\n\nCritics have routinely labeled Stewart, who also chairs the Prince William County Board of Supervisors, an opportunist trying to use racial discord for political gain. His main Republican primary opponent accused him of \u201cdog-whistling\u201d to win support from white supremacists, anti-Semites and racists. Stewart has had to disavow past associates, including Jason Kessler, the major organizer of last year\u2019s violent protests in Charlottesville.\n\n\u201cThis is an individual who is a lawyer, and a Georgetown grad, he knows who these people are, he knows what they stand for,\u201d Kaine said of Stewart at a debate.\n\nKaine\u2019s campaign message centers on fostering a \u201cVirginia that works for all.\u201d\n\nA former governor and lieutenant governor seeking a second Senate term, Kaine has never lost a statewide election in Virginia. But having been Hillary Clinton\u2019s running mate in 2016, he\u2019s keenly aware of the threat of an upset. Kaine has kept a full campaign schedule and amassed a war chest 10 times the size of Stewart\u2019s. Kaine has used the money to blanket the state with ads, while Stewart only recently started limited circulation of television ads.\n\nKaine has frequently campaigned with Democratic congressional candidates, spending much of the past week supporting Democrats in deep-red, rural districts.\n\nOn Monday, he did three events with Jennifer Lewis, a Democrat running in a western Virginia district that Trump won by about 25 percentage points. She said Kaine was the first person to call her when she won her primary, and has given helpful advice since.\n\n\u201cWhen he shows up, it definitely increases the crowd for sure,\u201d Lewis said.\n\nStewart says he\u2019s not bothered that other Republicans aren\u2019t campaigning with him, and he insists the polls are wrong.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m all in, there\u2019s nothing to go back to,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m all in, I\u2019ve got to win ...

(AP) \u2014 With President Donald Trump clamoring to defeat U.S. Sen. Jon Tester and conservative groups spending heavily against him, the Democrat is falling back on a well-worn strategy in his pursuit of a third term: make the election about Montana, not Washington.\n\nTrump\u2019s feud with Tester, triggered by the lawmaker\u2019s opposition to Trump\u2019s choice for Veterans Affairs secretary, has blossomed into an all-out presidential campaign to install Republican Matt Rosendale. Trump is making a record fourth visit to Montana on Saturday.\n\nInstead of fighting back, Tester has sought to ingratiate himself with Trump\u2019s supporters, reminding them of legislation on veterans that he sponsored and the president signed and touting his understanding of the state as a lifelong resident and farmer.\n\nTester avoids almost any mention of Trump in campaign speeches. He speaks about health care and Republican proposals to make it harder to get coverage for pre-existing conditions. He talks about protecting public lands in the state, while demonizing his opponent as \u201cMaryland Matt,\u201d a real estate developer from Maryland who falsely claims to be a rancher.\n\n\u201cLook, Montanans know who I am: They know I\u2019m a lifetime Montanan, they know I understand rural America, they know I understand public lands and not privatizing them, they know I understand the importance of public education,\u201d Tester said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cMatt Rosendale isn\u2019t any of that.\u201d\n\nRosendale, Montana\u2019s state auditor and insurance commissioner, has looked to score points by using the GOP playbook \u2014 plugging a hardline immigration stance and highlighting Tester\u2019s opposition to Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominees. But his primary strategy seems to be riding the president\u2019s coattails.\n\n\u201cHow can you argue about the tax cuts and the benefits being provided to the people of Montana and the nation?\u201d Rosendale said during an interview. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing national security in a better place. We\u2019re starting to work on securing our southern border. ... These are things that are working for people across the state and across our nation.\u201d\n\nA Rosendale victory would give Montana an all-GOP congressional delegation and could cement the party\u2019s control of a closely divided Senate.\n\nRosendale, 58, moved to Glendive, Montana, with his wife and three sons in 2002. He won a seat in the state Legislature in 2010. He ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. House in 2014, became state Senate majority leader the next year and was elected in 2016 as state auditor.\n\nTester, 62, is married with two children. He took over his family\u2019s farm in the town of Big Sandy after college and taught music at an elementary school. He was elected to the state Senate in 1998 and the U.S. Senate in 2006. In 2012, Tester beat back a challenge from a Republican congressman.\n\nLibertarian Rick Breckenridge rounds out Tuesday\u2019s Senate ballot. He hasn\u2019t been actively campaigning and on Thursday threw his support behind Rosendale. The move caught Libertarian leaders off guard and was disavowed by the party\u2019s chairman, Francis Wendt, who said Rosendale was weak on personal privacy protections.\n\nThe GOP is hopeful the move will prevent a repeat of Tester\u2019s 2012 re-election, when a Libertarian candidate peeled away enough votes that they could have changed the outcome if they had gone to the Republican.\n\nTrump\u2019s appearance Saturday in Belgrade will mark the most visits to Montana by any sitting president. He took a personal interest in the race after Tester released allegations of workplace misconduct against Trump\u2019s first nominee for VA secretary, Ronny Jackson, who withdrew from consideration in April.\n\nJackson has denied the allegations and they are being investigated by Pentagon officials.\n\nAt Saturday\u2019s rally, Trump railed against Tester for three minutes for attempting to \u201cruin\u201d Jackson, \u201cthe most clean-cut, wonderful person that\u2019 you\u2019ve ever met,\u201d the president said.\n\n\u201cHe tried to destroy him, and I\u2019ve never forgotten,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s honestly one of the reasons I\u2019ve been here so much.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s attentions have helped boost a candidate who wasn\u2019t the GOP\u2019s first or even second choice to take on the two-term incumbent. The White House blitz in Montana also included multiple trips by the president\u2019s son, Vice President Mike Pence and a parade of Republican senators.\n\nThe visits have fired up interest in the race but that could backfire if it motivates voters who disapprove of the president, said David Parker, a political analyst at Montana State University.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re putting all their chips on the table with the Trump brand,\u201d Parker said, adding that Rosendale\u2019s campaign had no choice, with Tester outraising him 4-to-1 in donations.\n\nOutside groups and donations to the candidates have reached $60 million, a record for Montana politics.\n\nIn Rosendale\u2019s view, Tester embodies the same corrupt Washington establishment that the Democrat pledged to change when he first ran in 2006. Tester now ranks as one of the top recipients of cash donations from lobbyists among all members of Congress, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.\n\n\u201cHow can you stand there 12 years ago and say that I won\u2019t be encumbered by lobbyists, and this is the number one recipient?\u201d Rosendale said of Tester. \u201cPeople spend too much time in Washington, D.C., and they become intoxicated with the power and privilege that\u2019s presented to them.\u201d\n\nTester has made a name for himself as a proponent of campaign finance reform and says the amount of money going into the race is out of his control.\n\n\u201cLook, this is the landscape,\u201d Tester said. \u201cThe difference is, I will push and I will work hard for campaign finance reform.

The U.S. Army is being criticized for reburying the remains of two recently discovered Civil War soldiers without conducting DNA testing. The soldiers were found at Manassas National Battlefield, among severed limbs in what researchers believe was a surgeon\u2019s pit. Army officials said DNA testing was unjustified and reburied them as unknown soldiers at Arlington National Cemetery. (AP Photo/Cliff Owen)\n\nARLINGTON, Va. (AP) \u2014 When Paul Davis heard earlier this year that the complete remains of two Civil War soldiers had been uncovered recently at Manassas National Battlefield, mixed among severed limbs in a surgeon\u2019s pit, he immediately wondered: Could that be his great-great uncle William, who died at the Second Battle of Bull Run, but whose bones had been lost to history?\n\nFrom what he knew of his ancestor\u2019s death, it seemed possible. Davis had read letters that said William \u2014 a color sergeant in the 2nd Wisconsin Infantry Regiment, part of the Union Army\u2019s famed Iron Brigade \u2014 died after being taken by ambulance for treatment.\n\nUnfortunately for Davis, he may never find out.\n\nArmy officials rejected requests from several families to conduct DNA testing that might have enabled their identification before reburying the remains as unknown soldiers at Arlington National Cemetery in September.\n\n\u201cThe Army made the decision that the costs associated with obtaining, storing, and testing of the DNA from these two Unknown U.S. Soldiers was not justified due to the significant passage of time as the possibility of identifying comparator DNA is extremely unlikely,\u201d a statement from Army officials at the cemetery says.\n\nDavis said he finds the Army\u2019s stance insulting.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t put someone in a box for eternity without their name if you have the ability to identify that person,\u201d said Davis, 64, of Fort Myers, Florida.\n\nDavis noted that the U.S. military has an entire department working to identify remains of service members, but the agency only investigates cases going back to World War II. He said he doesn\u2019t understand why the military\u2019s commitment comes with an apparent expiration date on older conflicts.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a covenant that exists between our country and our soldiers: If they\u2019re lost, our country will try to find them, and if they\u2019re found, our country will try to identify them,\u201d Davis said. \u201cWhen a soldier makes the ultimate sacrifice in battle for his country, when does the commitment to bring him home end?\u201d\n\nThis discovery was unusual, and accidental. Countless unidentified soldiers were buried where they fell during the Civil War. National Park Service policy is to leave their remains in place, considering battlefields to be hallowed ground.\n\nThese bodies were discovered in 2014 when workers digging to install a pipeline uncovered human bones. Researchers eventually found nearly a dozen severed limbs, along with two full sets of remains. They were able to conclude the soldiers were members of the Union Army, based on uniform buttons found in the pit and a bullet lodged in the one man\u2019s femur, fired from a Confederate Enfield rifle.\n\nThe location corresponds with work done by surgeons in the battle\u2019s aftermath, as the Union medical corps sent ambulances to collect the wounded and treat those left lying on the battlefield who could be saved, said Douglas Owsley, an anthropologist with the Smithsonian Institution who examined the remains.\n\nOwsley said he does not dispute the Army\u2019s contention that DNA testing would be unlikely to identify the two individuals, because there could be many potential candidates with plausible claims like those put forward by Davis, given the large number of casualties at Second Bull Run.\n\nThe Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency already has a $144 million budget and 600 staffers working to identify tens of thousands of remains, and typically identifies about 200 service members a year. Making an exception in Davis\u2019 case could open the door to an even larger caseload by violating its firm rule against investigating pre-World War II conflicts.\n\nOwsley said some consideration was given to developing DNA profiles of the remains before they were reburied, but the Army opted against that as well, noting that Arlington was founded as a place to honor the Civil War dead, both known and unidentified.\n\n\u201cThe Army feels strongly that the dignified burial of these two sets of remains is in keeping with the over 2,000 Civil War Unknowns who were killed in action near the national capital region and are buried at Arlington National Cemetery,\u201d the Army said in its statement.\n\nOwsley said it may be easier to identify the severed limbs. Surgeons were under orders to document amputations so that Army pensions could be issued to these wounded soldiers, and there are fairly extensive records of surgeries from the battle. Owsley said he hopes to preserve samples from the limbs, which are stored at the Smithsonian, but the Army has not yet agreed to such testing.\n\nDavis said every detail he learns about the case seems to jibe with his ancestor\u2019s story. He said no one at the Army was willing to look at his documents and other evidence corroborating the possibility that his ancestor has been unearthed.\n\nFor instance, Park Service officials said Davis\u2019 ancestor couldn\u2019t have been connected because he served in a Wisconsin regiment, and isotope testing \u2014 which can be done less expensively and more easily than DNA testing \u2014 indicated the two soldiers were likely from New England. But Davis said his great-great uncle lived in Maine before moving to the Midwest for work as a lumberjack.\n\nIndeed, a headstone in a Maine cemetery bears William Garcelon Davis\u2019 name, marking an empty gravesite. That\u2019s why Paul Davis wants his ancestor buried in Maine, even though he recognizes the honor of burial at Arlington.\n\n\u201cThe ones who loved him, that\u2019s where they thought he belonged,\u201d Davis said.", "The Latest: Caravan splinters as it heads through Mexico\n\nCentral American migrants, part of the caravan hoping to reach the U.S. border, wait for a ride in Donaji, Oaxaca state, Mexico, Friday, Nov. 2, 2018.

(AP Photo/Tony Dejak, File)\n\nOXFORD, Ohio (AP) \u2014 Ohio Democrats are hoping one of their winningest politicians ever can help halt statewide Republican domination, pitting Sen. Sherrod Brown\u2019s popularity against Donald Trump\u2019s after the impressive 2016 presidential-race victory raised questions about the future of the Buckeye State\u2019s traditional role as a bellwether.\n\nBrown, who won his first Ohio legislative election in 1974, is expected to capture a third term by a substantial margin over Trump-backed GOP Rep. Jim Renacci. The governor\u2019s race is considered a toss-up, other statewide races are competitive, and Democrats are within range to flip a House seat or two. Republicans swept statewide offices in 2014 and 2016, and Trump\u2019s 8-point win over Democrat Hillary Clinton was the biggest presidential margin in Ohio since 1988.\n\nDemocrats know that in a midterm election, which tends to favor the out-of-power party, and with an open governorship because Republican incumbent John Kasich is term-limited, this is their best opportunity in years to turn that tide.\n\nBrown has been campaigning in the final week for other Democrats on the ballot and has made fundraising appeals for Democratic governor nominee Richard Cordray. He is transferring $300,000 from a Brown-led fundraising committee to help other Democrats. He has raised $2 million for Ohio Democrats in the current two-year election cycle, while raising more than $27 million for his own campaign.\n\n\u201cI think people want change,\u201d Brown said in an AP interview before his third Senate debate, at Miami University. \u201cI think people see corruption in Columbus, and the rich getting tax cuts. I think that\u2019s going to affect voters up and down the ticket.\u201d\n\nBrown said he wants Cordray, a former federal consumer watchdog, as \u201cmy partner\u201d in standing up to Wall Street.\n\nBrown planned to join former Vice President Joe Biden, Cordray and other Democratic candidates Saturday in the Cleveland area. Meanwhile, Trump will lead a rally for Republicans in Cleveland on Monday, the day before the election.\n\nTrump is not on this year\u2019s ballot but is very much on the minds of voters on both sides.\n\nEven in the same house.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping that the Democrats are motivated to get out there and vote,\u201d said Sally Schott, executive director of a nonprofit organization. The suburban Cincinnati woman, 58, is alarmed at \u201chow uncivil things are right now.\u201d\n\nHer husband, Tom, 62 and retired from a career in print communication sales, said he expects Republicans will turn out to express their support for Trump, as he will.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s done real well. The economy\u2019s doing well; I think the world\u2019s in a better place,\u201d Schott said. \u201cI\u2019m happy.\u201d\n\nAnother Republican sweep on the heels of Trump\u2019s decisive 2016 victory might move the state off a 2020 Democratic presidential nominee\u2019s must-win list, said Kyle Kondik, who wrote 2016\u2032s \u201cThe Bellwether.\u201d Kondik, at the University of Virginia Center for Politics, studied the state\u2019s record of picking the presidential winner in all but two elections since the 19th century.\n\n\u201cGiven how Trump ran pretty significantly ahead of his national margin in Ohio, I wonder if that will scare off Democratic presidential investment,\u201d Kondik said.\n\nBut Kondik agreed that Brown could lift Democrats in tight races such as the governor\u2019s race between Cordray and Attorney General Mike DeWine, a former senator unseated by Brown in 2006 who has been winning elections nearly as long as Brown has.\n\nBrown said he couldn\u2019t predict whether he will have any coattails.\n\n\u201cYou guys get to do that,\u201d he replied.\n\nThe gravelly voiced senator speaks blue-collar language and has populist appeal. He has praised Trump moves to toughen trade deals and use tariffs.\n\n\u201cSherrod Brown is the most difficult Democrat in Ohio to beat,\u201d said Gary Cates, a former longtime Republican state legislator in southwest Ohio. \u201cHe\u2019s a got a pretty good brand that represents a broad cross-section of people.\u201d\n\nBrown has also been a state legislator, secretary of state, and congressman, winning 15 of his 16 elections.\n\nA Brown campaign ad had factory workers praising Brown, 65, while noting he has been described as \u201cdisheveled,\u201d \u2033rumpled\u201d and \u201cwrinkled.\u201d\n\n\u201cSherrod Brown is just exactly what you see,\u201d said Michele Fisher, 61, a small-business woman in suburban Cincinnati. \u201cHe will listen. He\u2019s there to help people.\u201d\n\nIn an Oct. 12 rally in the southwest Ohio community of Lebanon, Trump urged support for Renacci, a fourth-term congressman who decided to challenge Brown after getting White House encouragement. Trump took note of Brown\u2019s support of him on tougher trade.\n\n\u201cIn fact, I just want to think, is he a Republican?\u201d Trump said. But he added: \u201cHe didn\u2019t vote for tax cuts. He doesn\u2019t vote for us, folks. It might be nice for him to say he agrees with my economic policy when he\u2019s never going to vote for it.\u201d\n\nBesides the tax cuts, Brown has been sharply critical of Trump\u2019s immigration policies and has called on Renacci to join him in urging Trump to show leadership in trying to unite the country.\n\nBefore the rally on a rainy Friday evening in a Warren County Fairgrounds arena, Renacci said in an interview that Brown\u2019s lead isn\u2019t as big as widely reported, and that \u201cif we get turnout, he loses.\u201d\n\nJourney\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Stop Believin\u2019\u201d blared on the arena speakers as Renacci spoke. Recent polls have given Brown a double-digit percentage-point lead. Renacci blames Brown\u2019s fundraising prowess on special interests.\n\nRenacci has repeatedly said Brown\u2019s liberal record is more like \u201ca Hollywood liberal\u201d than a typical Ohioan\u2019s views. Renacci, 59, has recycled 1980s allegations of domestic abuse from Brown\u2019s divorce, triggering a campaign ad by Brown\u2019s ex-wife, who has remained a political supporter of Brown, saying Renacci \u201cshould be ashamed.\u201d\n\nBrown\u2019s campaign followed with an ad for \u201cAir Renacci,\u201d satirizing the businessman\u2019s campaign flights aboard a strip-club owner\u2019s private plane.\n\nBrown was vetted by Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign as a possible 2016 running mate, but he insists he has no strong interest in running for president in 2020.\n\nRepublicans including Cates say don\u2019t underestimate the power of the guy not on the ballot.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been really surprised by the level of Trump energy there still is in Butler County,\u201d said Ann Becker, a West Chester Township trustee and veteran GOP activist. \u201d(Trump) kind of galvanizes us.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics\n\n___\n\nFollow Dan Sewell at https://www.twitter.com/dansewell", "With 2 more goals, Suarez keeps Barca winning without Messi\n\nFC Barcelona's Luis Suarez celebrates after scoring during the Spanish La Liga soccer match between Rayo Vallecano and FC Barcelona at the Vallecas stadium in Madrid, Spain, Saturday, Nov. 3, 2018. (AP Photo/Manu Fernandez)\n\nBARCELONA, Spain (AP) \u2014 Luis Suarez is making sure Barcelona keeps on winning without the injured Lionel Messi.\n\nSuarez came to the rescue of Barcelona on Saturday with a two-goal performance that included a 90th-minute winner to cap a 3-2 comeback at Rayo Vallecano.\n\nSuarez\u2019s double gives him six goals for Barcelona since Messi went down with a broken right forearm on Oct. 20.

Suarez then scored his second goal to complete the fightback when he was left unmarked to stab in Sergi Roberto\u2019s cross at the far post.\n\nVINICIUS SAVES SOLARI\n\nFor a second straight game under Solari, Madrid has turned to an 18-year-old newcomer to get a much-needed victory.\n\nMinutes after replacing Marco Asensio, Vinicius Junio showed more verve than his fellow forward by darting past a defender and unleashing a powerful shot. His strike deflected in off Valladolid defender Kiko Olivas. The league credited Vinicius with the 83rd-minute goal.\n\n\u201cWhen I received the ball, I was thinking about scoring. I counted \u2018one, two, three\u2019 and then struck it hard,\u201d Vinicius said.\n\nSergio Ramos added another goal from the penalty spot with two minutes remaining after Karim Benzema was fouled by Fernando Calero.\n\nSolari gave Vinicius his first start for Madrid on Wednesday, and the Brazil forward responded by setting up two goals to beat Melilla in the Copa del Rey. Vinicius played 12 minutes under Solari\u2019s predecessor, Julen Lopetegui, since he joined the club this summer from Flamengo.\n\nWhile some of Madrid\u2019s players were jeered by the home fans for the team\u2019s recent form, Vinicius received applause when he went on in the 73rd.\n\nSolari said he told Vinicius to \u201ctake chances, to have a go at the defense.\u201d\n\nGRIEZMANN FREE KICK\n\nAntoine Griezmann scored from a free kick before Atletico conceded a late goal to draw for a third consecutive away match.\n\nLeganes equalized through Guido Carrillo with eight minutes left.\n\nAtletico has won only one of six away matches in the league.\n\n\u201cWe know that it is at grounds like these where league titles are decided,\u201d Atletico midfielder Saul Niguez said. \u201cLeganes played a good first half, but we have to be more ambitious.\u201d\n\nMAD MESTALLA\n\nValencia was jeered by its fans at Mestalla Stadium, with many waving white handkerchiefs to emphasize their anger at the team\u2019s poor season, after it lost to an injury-depleted Girona 1-0.\n\nValencia, which finished fourth last season, is 14th after winning just once in 11 rounds.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "In this photo taken Wednesday, Sept. 12, 2018, Assemblywoman Anna Caballero, D-Salina talks with Lt.

(AP Photo/Nick Wass)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Scott Brooks knows he needs to try something to change the way things are going for his Washington Wizards. The problems are so plentiful, the coach just is not quite sure what to do.\n\nAll-Star guards John Wall and Bradley Beal lead the Wizards into their game against the visiting New York Knicks on Sunday with a 1-7 record, including 0-3 at home, and five consecutive losses overall.\n\n\u201cPatience is running low from everybody,\u201d Beal said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to do it more collectively. The only way were going to get out of this slump is we\u2019ve got to do it together.\u201d\n\nTheir defense already was the worst in the NBA, giving up 122.4 points per game, before allowing even more than that in a 134-111 setback against Russell Westbrook and the Oklahoma City Thunder on Friday night.\n\n\u201cIt just looks like nobody\u2019s on the same page. I mean, like, if one person gets beat or somebody gives up a wide-open shot, nobody is there to help that person or pick that person up. Got to all be on one string,\u201d Wall said. \u201cYou can\u2019t teach effort. You can\u2019t teach heart. You\u2019ve got to go out there and compete. That\u2019s just something you\u2019ve got to be born with.\u201d\n\nThe transition defense, in particular, is absent.\n\nWashington\u2019s rebounding isn\u2019t much better.\n\nIts second unit \u2014 which Brooks often deploys without a starter to lead the way \u2014 is slumping and turned a 30-all contest against OKC into a 79-50 blowout by halftime. Turnovers have become a real issue, with Beal and Wall combining for 12 on Friday.\n\nSo how will Brooks fix all of that?\n\n\u201cEverything\u2019s open. We have to figure out ways to play better in all the 48 minutes that we\u2019re on the floor, whether it\u2019s going with a smaller rotation or it\u2019s playing other guys. I have to figure it out,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t just keep watching the same thing over and over and over and expect things are going to change.\u201d\n\nAgainst the Thunder, the Wizards led by 10 points in the first quarter, but were run off the court in the second, outscored by 24 in that period alone.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where they killed us,\u201d Wall said. \u201cWhen we\u2019re not making shots, we don\u2019t defend at a high level.\u201d\n\nThe Wizards heard boos from spectators as the Thunder pulled away and piled on.\n\n\u201cWe know the fans are getting impatient with it. Ted is probably impatient with it,\u201d Beal said, referring to team owner Ted Leonsis. \u201cSo we\u2019ve just got to do it.\u201d\n\nOtherwise, this season is on the verge of spiraling out of control.\n\nLast season, when Wall sat out 41 games because of a bad knee, Washington was the Eastern Conference\u2019s No. 8 seed and lost in the first round of the playoffs to No. 1 seed Toronto. There were questions about chemistry, defense and rebounding.\n\nTeam architect Ernie Grunfeld hoped to help those last two areas by adding center Dwight Howard. But Howard wasn\u2019t able to play in a Wizards uniform until Friday after dealing with a sore backside. And while his debut looked promising at the outset \u2014 13 of his 20 points came in the first quarter \u2014 the result was the same for the team.\n\n\u201cDwight,\u201d Brooks noted, \u201cwas a bright spot.\u201d\n\nThose have been few and far between lately for the Wizards during what their coach called \u201ca tough patch.\u201d\n\nThat might be underselling it.\n\nNo one in the NBA has a worse record.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t keep looking at the negatives, negatives, negatives,\u201d Beal said, \u201cbecause it\u2019s just going to continue to brainwash us and kill us mentally.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Howard Fendrich on Twitter at http://twitter.com/HowardFendrich\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "CINCINNATI (AP) \u2014 A police spokesman says a K-9 officer on the Cincinnati police SWAT team has been placed on restricted duty for allowing a friend to wear his tactical vest and drive his take-home cruiser while bar hopping Halloween night.\n\nWXIX-TV reports Lt.

Federer saved both break points, and Djokovic whacked his racket into the ground, drawing the first and only boos of a titanic match.\n\nDjokovic held his hands up as if to apologize to the unforgiving crowd, unhappy that a pique of rage interrupted their gourmet feast of tennis.\n\nBrimming with confidence in a season which has seen him go from No. 22 in the rankings in May to No. 1 when they are released on Monday, and in which he also added the U.S. Open to his Grand Slam haul, Djokovic created pressure throughout.\n\nBut Federer saved every break point \u2014 12 of them \u2014 and secured the only break of the match in clinching the second set.\n\n\u201cHasn\u2019t happened too many times that I don\u2019t break a serve of anyone, especially if I have 12 break points,\u201d Djokovic said. \u201cMost of the break points he just served well, and played great shots.\u201d\n\nThe best one of the match went to Federer in the eighth game. As Federer charged to the net, Djokovic hit a powerful forehand which clipped the net and flew to the left of Federer, wrong-footing him. From a seemingly impossible angle, and totally off balance, he scooped his racket behind his neck and flicked a volley over the net for a winner.\n\nFederer thrust his arms into the air, the crowd rose to their feet in sheer disbelief.\n\nEven by Federer\u2019s lofty standards, it was remarkable.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why he is who he is,\u201d Djokovic said, admiringly.\n\nBut after losing the match, Federer was left shaking his head.

Moore said he\u2019s never had a black professor in his business administration major, but called the university\u2019s hiring of an assistant vice chancellor for inclusion an \u201cawesome\u201d step.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Omaha World-Herald, http://www.omaha.com", "NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 Tennessee voters will elect a new governor Tuesday, ushering in a new administration with new priorities.\n\nIf elected, Republican Bill Lee says he\u2019ll tackle expanding vocational education, implementing criminal justice reforms and helping spur job creation but offered few details on specific policies he wants to see passed within his first legislative session.\n\nLee, owner of Franklin-based Lee Company, is making his first run for political office. The GOP nominee often touts the success of his firm \u2014 a $225 million mechanical contracting, facilities and home services company with more than 1,200 employees \u2014 as evidence he\u2019s ready to lead the state.\n\nDemocrat Karl Dean promises to hit the ground running on expanding the state\u2019s Medicaid program to increase coverage to the state\u2019s neediest residents, even though he will likely face a Republican-dominant Legislature that has previously resisted such efforts.\n\nDean, a former Nashville mayor, says he\u2019s undaunted by the challenge because he has experience in public service and a willingness to work with both political parties.\n\nBut first he has to get elected. While he\u2019s long on specifics he\u2019s been short on flair, and some critics say he has not swung hard enough or campaigned with enough fire to overcome the state\u2019s growing tendency to vote Republican.\n\nDean has trailed in the polls for most of the campaign, but remains hopeful he\u2019s closing that gap.\n\n\u201cIf I win this election, the voters will have spoken pretty clearly,\u201d Dean said. \u201cThe voters will have elected someone who campaigned on getting this done.\u201d\n\nDean mostly stuck with positive campaign messaging, but lately has issued warnings about what a Lee administration would look like. In a statewide television ad he described the Republican\u2019s policy positions on guns and school vouchers as \u201cextreme.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just trying to get people to know what\u2019s coming,\u201d Dean told The Associated Press earlier this week.\n\nWith GOP Gov. Bill Haslam and House Speaker Beth Harwell leaving office, Dean said, the Legislature is losing its key gatekeepers on preventing far-right conservative policies from becoming law. Dean said he didn\u2019t believe Lee would offer adequate pushback like Haslam.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be no check,\u201d Dean said.\n\nIn a recent phone interview with AP, Lee declined to address Dean\u2019s characterization. Instead, he said anything he wants to accomplish must include a strong relationship with the Legislature.\n\nIf elected, Lee says he\u2019ll work to \u201cdedicate funding and reallocate commitments\u201d to support his education proposals to expand vocational training to give more students options when leaving high school. The details are still being fleshed out, Lee said.\n\nLee also said Tennessee\u2019s sentencing and recidivism laws will have his attention come January. He said the state could work with private groups to reduce the number of people who return to prison and possibly propose changes to sentencing for certain crimes.\n\nHe said that, \u201d... I suspect this session we will develop legislation that will in fact address re-entry, that will address intake and that will begin to address sentencing reform.\u201d\n\nLee has positioned himself as a political outsider that Tennessee needs to bring the state from \u201cgood to great.\u201d However, that stance also comes with questions on how he\u2019ll govern.\n\nLee has been asked multiple times where he stands on school vouchers, but hasn\u2019t said clearly what he would or would not veto when it comes to funneling public money to private schools. Dean has come out against vouchers.\n\nDean has endorsed legalizing medicinal marijuana, while Lee says the data hasn\u2019t shown medicinal marijuana is the right approach for states. On immigration, Lee opposes giving in-state public higher education tuition to students whose parents brought or kept them in the country illegally while Dean supports doing so.\n\nAnd while Lee has made his religious faith one of the central talking points of his gubernatorial campaign, he didn\u2019t respond when asked if he would have vetoed legislation making the Bible the official state book of Tennessee \u2014 as Haslam did in 2016.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what the specifics of that bill were,\u201d Lee said. \u201cMy hope is that I\u2019ll govern in a way that brings people together and doesn\u2019t divide.\u201d\n\nLee is much more comfortable talking about where he stands on guns. He says \u201cqualified and vetted\u201d teachers should be armed in schools. He also promises to sign legislation that would expand \u201cconstitutional rights\u201d to carry firearms and opposes a ban on any type of weapons but particularly assault weapons.\n\nDean counters that those positions back up his claims that Lee would be coming to the governor\u2019s seat with \u201cextreme\u201d views.\n\n\u201cTennessee has very pro-Second Amendment laws, I would say it\u2019s not mainstream to have guns in schools,\u201d he said. \u201cMost of us agree that some people, those who have made threats or mental illness, should not have guns.\u201d", "LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) \u2014 China\u2019s decision to require cleaner recyclables has put some U.S. recyclers out of business or forced them to limit the kind of materials they will take.\n\nBut in Lincoln the China decision has had a more limited impact, so far.\n\nRecycling processing companies \u2014 which buy from local haulers, sort and resell material \u2014 have raised their rates, but they are still taking all the traditional recycling products, except for glass and plastic bags.\n\nIn January, China, the world\u2019s leading recyclables buyer, closed its doors to waste paper, metals or plastic unless they\u2019re 99.5 percent pure.\n\nThat\u2019s an unattainable standard at most U.S. single-stream recycling processing plants.\n\n\u2033(China\u2019s decision) affected everyone, but it probably has had a different impact here than on the coasts, largely because we haven\u2019t had the same luxury of sending everything off to China,\u201d said Dale Gubbels, CEO of First Star Fiber, a Nebraska processor.\n\nBoth First Star Fiber and Mid America Recycling have raised their rates to haulers, who handle Lincoln\u2019s curbside recycling, the Lincoln Journal Star reported.\n\nIn some cases the rates are higher than the city landfill fees.\n\nIn Lincoln, recycling companies relied more heavily on domestic companies to purchase their recyclables and have built up relationships with domestic mills, Gubbels said.\n\nSo local processors still have a market for recyclables. But, because of supply and demand, the prices for recyclable products have dropped.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have much choice. We have to cover our costs,\u201d Gubbels said, about recycling processors raising their rates.\n\nThe city has been less affected because the recyclable material from the public sites is already sorted, giving it a higher value, said Donna Garden, assistant director at Public Works and Utilities.\n\n\u201cThe materials we take to the processors are clean and separated,\u201d she said.\n\nBut the city has seen a drop this year in the price it is reimbursed for recyclable material. The combined value for total recyclables has dropped from about $40 a ton at the beginning of the year to about $28 a ton, according to Garden.\n\nBecause of the increase in recyclables being taken to city centers, the city\u2019s revenue of about $16,000 a month has not changed.\n\nThe city has also seen an increase in costs, from an average of $37,000 per month to $55,000 per month, for hauling recyclables from the city sites because of the dramatic increase in cardboard recycling since the city banned corrugated cardboard at the landfill April 1.\n\nThe city pays hauler Von Busch for pulling each container from a recycling center, under a three-year contract. The cost per pull hasn\u2019t changed but the amount of material dropped off at city sites has increased, Garden said.\n\nBut recycling is not just about the money, according to Garden. Recycling is important because it diverts material from the landfill, saves natural resources, provides jobs and \u201cis a good thing for the environment.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have to keep that in mind,\u201d she said.\n\nLocal haulers are concerned as they see some processors in surrounding states refusing to take some plastic and other material and raising rates.\n\n\u201cGlass is gone. Plastic\u2019s on the way out,\u201d said Ryan Hatten, with Paragon Sanitation and president of Lincoln Solid Waste and Recycling Association.\n\nWhat happens in surrounding states usually finds its way to Nebraska, he said.\n\nBut Gubbels and Kelley McReynolds, with Mid America Recycling, are optimistic that U.S. companies will find more ways to use recyclable material, increasing demand.\n\nFirst Star Fiber is working on a program where consumers will be able to buy a bright orange Hefty Energy bag that they will fill with non-recyclable plastic, like bags, bread wrappers, straws and items that degrade the value of recyclable material.\n\nThe plastic will be sent on to be used as a fuel or to a company that can use it for making fence posts, railroad ties, landscaping timbers and parking lot bumpers, Gubbels said.\n\nGubbels said he is also seeing some investments in the domestic market, a hopeful sign that there will be some new markets to replace China.\n\nBut McReynolds said he expects the fees to remain high and pressure to keep contaminants out of the recycling stream will continue.\n\nRecycling companies moved to single stream (where consumers do not have to separate the plastic from the paper and the cardboard) because they wanted to increase the level of recycling by making it more convenient, Gubbels said.\n\nRecyclers, like him, didn\u2019t take into account the cost of putting in the sorting system or that commodity prices would drop, he said.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Lincoln Journal Star, http://www.journalstar.com", "HOUMA, La. (AP) \u2014 One of the last commercial citrus growers in south Louisiana\u2019s Terrebonne Parish says he lost hundreds of trees to last winter\u2019s cold, but hopes that a good crop in his remaining trees will let him fill his orchard back up again.\n\n\u201cI lost between 300 to 400 trees of my trees during the winter, and I plan to plant about 300 to replace those,\u201d Terry Breaux told the LSU AgCenter.\n\nThe crop is ripening and sweetening earlier than usual, Breaux and LSU AgCenter horticulture agent Barton Joffrion of Houma said in a news release.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t seem to be the case in Plaquemines Parish, the heart of Louisiana\u2019s citrus business.\n\n\u201cNot any earlier than normal. But I ate a navel yesterday and it was very good,\u201d said Ben Becnel of Ben & Ben Becnel Inc. in Belle Chasse. He said he lost about 100 young citrus trees to last winter\u2019s freezes, but has about 3,000 left.\n\nStuart Riley, who has a small citrus farm in Port Sulphur, also said fruit seems to be ripening about the usual time.\n\n\u201cThere is a feeling that the fruit seems sweeter this year\u201d in Plaquemines Parish, AgCenter agent Joe Willis wrote in an email. He said that hadn\u2019t been expected because there was so much rain.\n\n\u201cThere is also an overall plentiful crop which is a blessing and a curse. The commercial growers have plenty to sell but the backyard orchard is also loaded. Therefore, sales are lagging,\u201d he wrote.\n\nPlaquemines Parish contributed $6.1 million of Louisiana\u2019s $11.6 million citrus business last year, compared to $230,300 in Terrebonne Parish \u2014 one of eight parishes with citrus crops worth at least $100,000, according to the LSU AgCenter\u2019s annual report. Other top citrus-producing parishes were Vermilion at $1.5 million, Beauregard with $1.2 million and Iberia at $1 million, Lafourche at $442,400; St. James at $202,200, and St. Mary at $103,700.\n\nThe state agriculture department tested satsuma sweetness earlier than usual in Terrebonne Parish, and ended early, Joffrion said.\n\nJoffrion said Terrebonne Parish had as many as 30 citrus growers a few years ago, but now there are only about five. Many older growers got out of the business after recent freezes, he said in a phone interview.\n\nBreaux, who hopes to get back up to about 1,200 trees, said he is surprised to have navel oranges ripening now, because they\u2019re normally about a month later than satsumas.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been testing my navels, and I would say they are ready right now due to their sweetness, but I\u2019m going to wait a few more weeks before I start picking,\u201d said Breaux, who markets most of his crop in Baton Rouge and Denham Springs.\n\nYard trees now provide much of Terrebonne Parish\u2019s citrus, Joffrion said. He had a tip for those growers: pick fruit as soon as it ripens, because leaving it on the branch saps energy from the tree.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen some satsuma growers with more than 500 pieces of fruit on their trees,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s way too much.\u201d\n\nAt the end of the season, Joffrion said, backyard growers should pick all the fruit.\n\n\u201cWe should have fruit from now through January, so if you\u2019re in the market for fresh fruit, now is the time to look for it,\u201d he said.\n\nBecnel said he grows some satsumas bred to bear fruit early, and began selling their fruit in early September.\n\n\u201cThey are getting really good,\u201d he said. \u201cThe best time is mid-November to New Year\u2019s, or even into mid-January.\u201d\n\nBecnel said, \u201cI\u2019ve seen satsumas sell into March and early April, as long as we don\u2019t get any freezes.\u201d", "OMAHA, Neb. (AP) \u2014 It\u2019s like a giant puzzle.\n\nAn approximately 4,000-piece limestone puzzle that involves cranes, labeling, assistance from an engineer in Indiana and careful planning to fit everything together.\n\nWhen it\u2019s done, the final product will be a new addition to the century-old Central High School in downtown Omaha.\n\nSchool expansions are not uncommon. But most don\u2019t happen because alumni see a need and then raise $19.3 million to make it a reality.\n\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t happen in public high schools. It just doesn\u2019t. But it does here in Omaha, thanks to our philanthropic community,\u201d said Central High School Principal Ed Bennett.\n\nThe Central High School Foundation wanted to provide new and updated spaces for the fine arts, but no one wanted the addition to block the view of the school or add a wing that would clash with the building\u2019s neoclassical style, the Omaha World-Herald reported.\n\nThat\u2019s where the limestone comes in.\n\nThe limestone being used for the project comes from the same area in Bloomington, Indiana, where the limestone for the original building was extracted, said Faron Riley, project manager for Sampson Construction.\n\nThe stone is cut in Indiana and then brought to Omaha, where it\u2019s milled.\n\nEvery piece of limestone is cut, fabricated and installed. Sampson Construction works with an engineer in Indiana to figure out the size, depth and cubic footage of each piece and how to anchor it to the building.\n\nSome of the limestone pieces weigh a couple of hundred pounds and can be set by hand. Other pieces weigh 800 to 900 pounds and have to be moved by crane.\n\n\u201cIt cost more. And it took a little longer. But we think it\u2019s worth it,\u201d Mike Lebens, class of 1970, said of the limestone. Lebens is the co-chair of the project\u2019s fundraising campaign.\n\nThe school\u2019s current library, vocal music and drama spaces have not been significantly updated since the 1930s.\n\nThe alumni knew that the fine arts spaces were outdated, small and not equivalent to those in other high schools. Lebens said they wanted to change that.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obvious that the alumni and donors love Central. That\u2019s why they made the donations,\u201d Lebens said. \u201cBut I think, without exception, we\u2019re all big supporters of public education. I think that\u2019s critically important for Omaha and the country.\u201d\n\nThe original school\u2019s limestone exterior was carefully cleaned and restored. The hope is that it will be difficult to tell where the original building starts and the addition begins.\n\nThe addition will provide new classrooms for instrumental and vocal music and a black box theater \u2014 a sparse, boxlike performing space that allows for flexible sets \u2014 that also will serve as a storm shelter.\n\nA new library also is being built. In addition to having books and computers, it also will have windows and a skylight that will let in natural light and offer a view of downtown Omaha.\n\nThe project also includes a plaza and a green roof.\n\nThe addition frees up 25,000 square feet of space inside the existing school.\n\nThat space will be repurposed for programs for special education students and English language learners. Bennett, the principal, said facilities for those students are inadequate because of the building\u2019s size and age.\n\nThe Omaha Public Schools kicked in $5.5 million for the renovation inside the existing building and to provide furniture and fixtures for the addition. The money came out of the district\u2019s site and building fund.\n\nConstruction work on the addition is expected to be completed in February. The goal is to have students in the new classrooms after spring break.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Omaha World-Herald, http://www.omaha.com", "Iowa silo to be turned into mural\n\nFORT DODGE, Iowa (AP) \u2014 There are big canvases to paint on, and then are BIG canvases.\n\nArtist Guido van Helten, of Brisbane, Australia, is working on the biggest one available in Fort Dodge \u2014 an 80-foot-tall abandoned concrete silo along Hawkeye Avenue.\n\nHe\u2019s recently started putting brush to concrete after meticulously planning the work.\n\n\u201cI trust my planning,\u201d he told The Messenger .\n\nThe mural will, in its finished form, be viewable from all four sides of the structure.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a 360-degree mural,\u201d van Helten said.\n\nVan Helten\u2019s work was chosen by the Public Art Committee, which was formed in 2016 to oversee the silo project. Members include city planning staff, the Fort Dodge Fine Arts Association, the Image Committee of the Greater Fort Dodge Growth Alliance, and staff from the Blanden Memorial Art Museum.\n\nHe\u2019s painted murals on large buildings all over the U.S., Asia, Europe and Australia.\n\nWhen planning a work, he considers the existing concrete surface, both its color and shape, to be an organic part of the work.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really cool to use the concrete as a base,\u201d he said. \u201cI use all the angles. Some are curved, some are flat.\u201d\n\nThe paint is specially formulated for concrete.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mineral-based paint,\u201d he said. \u201cIt bonds and becomes part of the wall.\u201d\n\nIt actually repels moisture, something that will be important in the future on the north-facing side of the silo.\n\n\u201cThere was a mold back here,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, with this paint, it protects the concrete as well.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t want to get too aggressive in removing that mold, he said, because he wanted to preserve the concrete\u2019s naturally aged patina.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to change it; I want to add to it,\u201d he said.\n\nRight now he\u2019s working on the sides that receive the least sunlight.\n\n\u201cWhen the weather turns I\u2019ll be in the sun,\u201d he said.\n\nHe\u2019s already had one turn with the Iowa weather.\n\n\u201cI was painting in the snow the other day,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cThe paint dries. It\u2019s OK.\u201d\n\nMuch of his workday is spent in a lift bucket high above the ground. He likes it when people come by and watch, but he isn\u2019t able to spend much time on the ground with them.\n\nAnd don\u2019t ask him how many gallons of paint he\u2019s going to use either. The land down under uses metric measurements.\n\n\u201cI use liters,\u201d he said.\n\nVan Helten doesn\u2019t have an exact date when he expects to complete his work, but he does have an estimate.\n\n\u201cEnd of November,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nThe silo mural project is funded entirely by donations from the community, local businesses and grants.

One of four brothers with Hansen\u2019s Dairy Farm in Hudson, Hansen quickly got to work acquiring the rare breed for his farm.\n\nWagyu meat has an extreme marbling, boasts health benefits and a \u201cmelt in your mouth\u201d level of tenderness.\n\n\u2033(The full-bred wagyu) was good, but it was just too rich for me. It\u2019s pretty powerful stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cI could only eat maybe 4 to 5 ounces.\u201d\n\nWith more than 150 Holstein dairy cattle outside his front door, Hansen decided to cross-breed his Holstein dairy cattle, which also are known for their fine marbling, with a wagyu.\n\n\u201cIt turned out to be fantastic,\u201d he said.\n\nThe prepared beef is available exclusively at the Table 1912 restaurant in Cedar Falls.\n\nChef Jim Nadeau of the Western Home Communities was one of Hansen\u2019s first customers when the retail stores opened in 2014. At Table 1912, the chefs have a \u201cFarm to Fork\u201d program where they use as much food from area farmers as possible.\n\n\u201cWe need to be unique here in order to draw people in, and it\u2019s a special product,\u201d Nadeau said. \u201cFor us to be the first place in Iowa to be able to use it basically right from farm to fork is phenomenal.\u201d\n\nHansen recently rolled out the Cedar Valley\u2019s first Holstein-Wagyu hamburger at Hansen\u2019s retail stores in Waterloo and Cedar Falls, with the rest of the cuts available for sale privately through Hansen. For those daring enough to try the full-flavored Wagyu, the full-bred beef will be ready near the end of 2019.\n\nCosts for the Wagyu-Holstein beef vary from $100 for a one-pound filet down to $8 for one pound of hamburger. Full-bred Japanese Wagyu beef can cost anywhere from $120 to $200.\n\nPronounced \u201cwag-you,\u201d the larger and meatier breed is derived from Japan. \u201cWa\u201d can be translated as Japanese, and \u201cgyu\u201d means cow, according to the American Wagyu Association.\n\nThe wagyu breed came to the U.S. in the 1980s. Hansen said monitoring the rare breed in the U.S. can be difficult, but some say there are less than 30,000 full-blood wagyu in the United States.\n\nHansen was able to purchase reproductive material from the Tajima strain from Japan, which are fattened longer, taking about 26 to 32 months to create the supreme marbling. Other U.S. beef cattle can take only 18 months to mature for consumption.\n\n\u201cSupposedly this Tajima line is one of the best Wagyu lines in the breed,\u201d Hansen said.\n\nA Holstein also creates a fair amount of marbling and requires a similar low-energy diet. While still boasting the wagyu\u2019s rich flavor, the Wagyu-Holstein crossbreeds produce a more palpable taste.\n\nWagyu has three times the amount of mono-unsaturated fatty acids compared to other beef breeds, meaning it\u2019s higher in unsaturated fat and oleic acid, which is said to be responsible for the rich flavor. Oleic acid also is found in olive and canola oil and, according to reports, can help lower bad LDL cholesterol.\n\nTypically, wagyu breeders will send the high-end quality cuts to the east and west coasts, Hansen said, but he plans to keep all of the meat in Iowa.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to keep everything here in the state, let alone the Cedar Valley, just to have people around us enjoy good cuts of meat and not getting rid of it to the coasts.\u201d\n\nHansen said the best way to cook a Wagyu-Holstein steak or burger is rare to medium rare at about 135 degrees.\n\n\u201cYou can definitely taste a difference when you\u2019re eating it in a patty,\u201d said Hansen\u2019s wife, Jordan. \u201cOther seasonings can dull the rich flavor.\u201d\n\nJordan Hansen said she considers the hamburger to be 90 percent lean.\n\n\u201cIf you over cook it, it\u2019s like any other hamburger then, there\u2019s nothing special to it because it gets dry and loses the flavor,\u201d she said.\n\nHansen said he is unsure how popular the beef will be in the Cedar Valley, but he plans to continue breeding and raising the special cattle well into the future.\n\n\u201cBeing that it takes 30 months to get one raised and ready for slaughter, you just don\u2019t want to stop now because if the consumer likes what they eat, then they\u2019re going to have to wait for another 30 months before they get another one,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a continuum of Wagyu-Holstein cattle coming down the pipe from here on out. . I know that I\u2019ll be eating some good quality meat for the rest of my life. If you are a beef eater, you are going to want to try it at least once.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier, http://www.wcfcourier.com", "Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea and Ashley Young celebrate after winning the English Premier League soccer match between Bournemouth and Manchester United at The Vitality Stadium, Bournemouth, England.Saturday Nov. 3, 2018.

At halftime I thought I was the luckiest manager in the Premier League because ... it should have been 5-2 or 6-2 (to Bournemouth).\n\n\u201cI said to my players (at halftime) it was impossible to play worse than we did and the second half was going to be better for sure.\u201d\n\nBuoyed by what Mourinho called \u201ccalm\u201d words at the interval, United was a transformed team in the second period and several times went close to scoring.\n\nBournemouth had a remarkable double escape in the 65th when Nathan Ake threw his body in the way of a shot from England striker Rashford after Young had hit the woodwork. David Brooks then hacked Paul Pogba\u2019s rebound off the line.\n\nIt proved a temporary reprieve, however, as Pogba dashed down the left two minutes into stoppage time before sending over an inviting center that Rashford chested down before beating Bournemouth goalkeeper Asmir Begovic.\n\n\u201cThe second half was exactly the opposite to the first,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cWe created a lot of chances, we pressed higher, we had much more aggression, intensity and intention.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe how bad we started. I was not at the warm-up but my assistants were telling me this is the best warm-up of our season, everybody very focused with a great intensity. I love the song \u2018Attack, attack, attack\u2019 but you need to know that when you lose the ball you have to have stability.\n\n\u201cWe are not showing we have stability. We were ready for everything, we worked tactically for everything. I really can\u2019t understand the kind of mentality that brings me more white hair.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP English soccer: https://apnews.com/tag/PremierLeague and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) \u2014 Arkansas\u2019 voters will decide Tuesday whether to raise the state\u2019s minimum wage, legalize casinos in four counties and enshrine a voter ID requirement in the state\u2019s constitution.\n\nAlthough questions will appear on the ballot that would cap the damages that could be awarded in lawsuits and impose strict term limits on legislators, the state Supreme Court disqualified those measures and votes cast for or against them won\u2019t be counted.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the valid proposals that will decided:\n\nCASINOS\n\nThe most expensive campaign among the ballot measures has been for a proposal to legalize casinos in four Arkansas counties, including at a dog track and horse track that already offer video poker and other electronic gambling.\n\nThe Cherokee and Quapaw tribes have spent more than $5.8 million combined on the campaign for th\u2019e measure, which would allow casinos at the Southland dog track in West Memphis and the Oaklawn horse track in Hot Springs. The proposal would allow one casino in Pope County and another in Jefferson County. Southland\u2019s parent company, Delaware North, also donated $1.1 million to the campaign.\n\nIf voters approve the measure, the state Racing Commission would be required to accept applications for the Pope and Jefferson County casinos by June 1, 2019. The casinos in those counties must have the support of the county judge or quorum court, as well as the mayor if it\u2019s located in the city.\n\nThe state Supreme Court rejected two lawsuits by opponents that sought to disqualify the measure.\n\nMINIMUM WAGE\n\nVoters will decide whether to raise Arkansas\u2019 minimum wage for the second time in four years.\n\nIf approved, the ballot proposal would gradually raise the state\u2019s minimum wage from $8.50 an hour to $11. It would raise the wage to $9.25 an hour on Jan. 1, 2019, then to $10 an hour the following year and $11 an hour the year after that.\n\nThe state Supreme Court rejected a lawsuit by business groups that opposed the measure and that claimed some of the petition signatures submitted to get the measure on the ballot were invalid.\n\nVOTER ID\n\nArkansas already has a voter ID law, but the ballot proposal would enshrine the requirement in the state\u2019s constitution.\n\nThe proposed constitutional amendment will add showing a photo identification to the list of qualifications to vote. The state Supreme Court recently upheld the current voter ID law, which the Republican-controlled Legislature and governor enacted last year. That law will remain on the books regardless of whether the ballot measure is approved.\n\n___\n\nFollow Andrew DeMillo on Twitter: https://twitter.com/ademillo\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "DODGE CITY, Kan.

Lamont is running against Republican Bob Stefanowski and independent Oz Griebel in Tuesday's general election. (AP Photo/Susan Haigh)\n\nHARTFORD, Conn. (AP) \u2014 Wealthy businessman Ned Lamont nearly rode a wave of Democratic anger over the Iraq war into the U.S. Senate in 2006. Twelve years later, he is hoping frustration with President Donald Trump will help carry him into Connecticut\u2019s governor\u2019s office.\n\nBut his Republican opponent, a fellow businessman, has an unpopular foil of his own in Democratic Gov. Dannel P. Malloy.\n\nBob Stefanowski has painted Lamont as a Malloy clone, someone who will raise taxes and fail to jumpstart Connecticut\u2019s economy. Lamont, meanwhile, has portrayed Stefanowski as a Trump disciple and threat to this politically blue state\u2019s values.\n\nBoth approaches appear to be working somewhat, considering an Oct. 30 Quinnipiac University Poll shows the race is very close. But many voters, already frustrated by the state\u2019s continued fiscal problems, are exasperated by an election they claim is long on negative ads and finger-pointing and short on specifics and good ideas.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re talking more about what this guy is going to do and what this guy is not going to do instead of addressing the problems during these debates, which kind of drives me crazy,\u201d said Keith Lesage, a 50-year-old design engineer at Westminster Tool Inc. in Plainfield. \u201cLet\u2019s start talking more about the issues.\u201d\n\nLamont, Stefanowski, petitioning independent candidate Oz Griebel and two other independent candidates are competing Tuesday to fill the job being vacated by Malloy, who is not seeking a third term.\n\nMalloy has suffered from low public approval ratings and taken the brunt of the public\u2019s blame for Connecticut\u2019s continued fiscal woes and higher taxes. While mostly absent from the campaign trail, grainy black-and-white pictures of Malloy appear frequently in ads run by Stefanowski and the Republican Governors Association, claiming Lamont will be a third Malloy term.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had eight years of this insanity,\u201d Stefanowski said. \u201cIt\u2019s time for a change.\u201d\n\nStefanowski, 56, has been laser-focused on his tax cut plan, including phasing out Connecticut\u2019s personal income tax over eight years. It resonated with some Electric Boat workers, who gave Stefanowski the thumbs up during a recent shift change.\n\nThe tax generates roughly $9 billion annually, more than half of Connecticut\u2019s gross revenue. While Stefanowski claims reducing the tax burden will spark economic growth, Lamont called the proposal \u201cradical.\u201d He said the wealthy will be the main beneficiaries while public services, such as education and health care, will be decimated. Both Lamont and Griebel have also slammed Stefanowski for not providing specifics on how he\u2019ll fill the revenue gap.\n\n\u201cMaybe Mexico is going to pay for it,\u201d Lamont recently quipped, a not-so-subtle reference to Trump and his claims Mexico will pay for a border wall.\n\nLamont, who has billed himself as a job creator, proposed more regionalization of local services, funding a property credit against the income tax and greater education investment.\n\nSo far, the 64-year-old cable company founder has poured more than $12 million into this race, his third run at a major higher office. He spent roughly $17 million of his money when he challenged U.S. Sen. Joe Lieberman in the Democratic primary. While Lamont won the primary, he lost the general election when Lieberman ran as an independent.\n\nWhile Stefanowski has denied Lamont\u2019s accusations, he has also avoided discussing national and social issues on the campaign trail, arguing voters care more about jobs and the economy. He loaned his campaign roughly $3 million, portraying himself as \u201cBob the Rebuilder,\u201d a corporate fix-it expert who can turn around state government. Lamont, in turn, has criticized Stefanowski for recently running a payday lending company.\n\nGriebel, meanwhile, has accused both major party candidates of falling short on specific ideas for tackling Connecticut\u2019s weighty financial problems. Besides large unfunded pension liabilities, the next governor will inherit a projected $2 billion deficit when he takes office in January. Griebel, a former Hartford chamber of commerce leader, banker and lawyer, has suffered from low name recognition, despite the endorsement of the Hartford Courant. The state\u2019s largest newspaper said the independent is \u201cin the best position to get Connecticut unstuck.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe spoilers in this race are the two major party candidates,\u201d said Griebel, who argues Lamont and Stefanowski will repeat the last 30 years of no net job growth, higher taxes and fees, under-investment in transportation, education and services for the most vulnerable.\n\nRetired teacher Jean Gordon, 79, of Mystic, said she wants change in Connecticut, but is concerned by the lack of ideas and back-and-forth bickering.\n\n\u201cThe accusatory things, it just isn\u2019t right,\u201d she said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t get us anywhere", "AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) \u2014 State officials are inviting the public to help collect family-held mementoes of Maine\u2019s involvement in World War I.\n\nThe public can help the effort Saturday at the Maine Cultural Building in Augusta.\n\nMaine State Librarian James Ritter says the state\u2019s looking for collections hidden away in closets and attics that tell the stories of Mainers in the \u201cGreat War.\u201d\n\nThe state\u2019s using state-of-the-art digitization technology to gather high quality images of such materials for future generations.\n\nTrained staff and volunteers will scan photos, diaries, scrapbooks and other mementoes on a first-come, first-serve basis.\n\nMaine State Library Staff Genealogist BJ Jamieson will help those seeking information about relatives\u2019 service history.", "GARYVILLE, La.

(AP Photo/Sue Ogrtocki, File)\n\nOKLAHOMA CITY (AP) \u2014 Oklahoma Republicans seized control of every statewide elected office in the 2010 midterm election, and they\u2019ve maintained their dominance ever since.\n\nBut in a state Republicans like to boast is the \u201creddest of the red,\u201d 72-year-old Democrat Drew Edmondson is threatening to break the GOP stranglehold and win back the governor\u2019s mansion after eight years under Republican Gov. Mary Fallin, who has reached her term limit.\n\nPolls have consistently shown Republican mortgage company owner Kevin Stitt, a 46-year-old political newcomer who casts himself in the mold of a businessman outsider like President Donald Trump, slightly ahead of Edmondson. But the race appears to be tightening. The Cook Political Report has moved it from \u201clikely Republican\u201d to \u201ctoss up,\u201d though FiveThirtyEight.com, which also analyzes political contests, still projects Stitt likely to win. A Libertarian, Chris Powell, also is running.\n\nDespite Republicans\u2019 growing advantage in voter registration and recent dominance at the ballot box, there are signs the party\u2019s grip on power may be slipping after years of a sluggish state economy, budget crises and GOP tax cuts that forced deep cuts to state programs, especially public schools.\n\nOver the last two years, Democrats have chipped away at the GOP\u2019s super majorities in the Legislature, winning a string of four special elections to claim seats previously held by Republicans, including two where the GOP incumbents stepped down amid sex scandals.\n\nDemocrats, particularly women , also appear to be energized by their opposition to Trump and by spring teacher walkouts in Republican-led states including Oklahoma, where schools shut down across the state while tens of thousands of educators and their supporters flooded the Capitol for two weeks of protests over school funding.\n\nSally\u2019s List, an Oklahoma group dedicated to recruiting and training politically liberal women for public office, endorsed about a dozen female candidates in each of the last two election cycles. This year, they\u2019ve endorsed 45.\n\nThe group\u2019s executive director, Sara Jane Rose, said a growing interest among women seeking office \u201cstarted with anti-Trump and gun violence, and then teachers sort of fell into that group, and also people looking at what\u2019s going on nationally with women mobilizing.\u201d\n\nThere are also signs of Democratic enthusiasm in rural areas where Republicans have made huge gains over the last two decades. In Pontotoc County, about 70 miles (110 kilometers) southeast of Oklahoma City, the local Democratic Party had to move its monthly meeting twice after attendance exploded following Trump\u2019s 2016 election. Two years ago, the party didn\u2019t field a single precinct officer. This year, it filled 24 of 27 positions, said local chairman Bobby Joe Trail.\n\nEdmondson also is generating enthusiasm among teachers, whom he courted with frequent visits during the walkout. They made \u201cRemember in November\u201d their mantra after becoming frustrated with Fallin and the GOP-led Legislature.\n\nDuring a recent campaign stop at JD\u2019s diner in the Pontotoc County community of Ada, Edmondson hit on familiar themes that he hopes will help neutralize Stitt\u2019s advantage in rural areas: improving public schools and expanding Medicaid to cover more of the working poor.\n\nThose sounded like good ideas to 72-year-old local Ronald Boggs.\n\n\u201cThe top two issues to me are education and health care,\u201d Boggs said. \u201cI think education hasn\u2019t been sufficiently funded and we don\u2019t pay our teachers enough.\u201d\n\nPat McFerron, a Republican political strategist and pollster, said that while he expects Stitt to win, Edmondson has been able to take advantage of growing discontent among voters with the direction the state is moving, particularly when it comes to education.\n\n\u201cI jokingly say the top three issues in the state are education, education funding and teacher pay,\u201d McFerron said. \u201cAnd on education issues, right or wrong, Democrats have an advantage.\u201d\n\nMcFerron said Stitt\u2019s opposition to this year\u2019s tax hikes that funded the teacher pay raise also \u201cis damaging when that\u2019s the top issue voters are talking about.\u201d\n\nStitt says despite his opposition to taxes, he supports raising teacher pay even more. And while he recognized the race is tight, he said his lack of political experience is a benefit.\n\n\u201cI think we have to have an outsider, a business person,\u201d Stitt told a packed crowd at a coffeehouse in the Oklahoma City enclave of Bethany.\n\nStitt also has amassed more than twice as much money as Edmondson, raising $10 million for his campaign, including nearly $5 million of his own money.\n\nOklahoma Republican Party Chair Pam Pollard agreed there is a rising level of enthusiasm among Oklahoma voters but that it also extends to Republicans, particularly after the testy Senate confirmation hearings for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh .\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see and hear the blue wave. I don\u2019t,\u201d Pollard said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk out there, but when I take a look at the polls, we\u2019re in good shape.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Sean Murphy on Twitter: https://twitter.com/apseanmurphy\n\n___\n\nFor the AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "This photo made available by the U.S. National Archives shows a portion of the United States Constitution with the title of Article V. For the past two centuries, constitutional amendments have originated in Congress, where they need the support of two-thirds of both houses, and then the approval of at least three-quarters of the states. But under a never-used second prong of Article V, amendments can originate in the states. (National Archives via AP)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Whatever success Republicans have amassed in taking control of all three branches of U.S. government, and whatever fate awaits them as midterm elections near, some on the right are working to cement change by amending the Constitution. And to the mounting alarm of others on all parts of the spectrum, they want to bypass the usual process.\n\nThey\u2019re pushing for an unprecedented Constitutional convention of the states. While opponents are afraid of what such a convention would do, supporters say it is the only way to deal with the federal government\u2019s overreach and ineptitude.\n\n\u201cThey literally see this as the survival of the nation,\u201d said Karla Jones, director of the federalism task force at the conservative American Legislative Exchange Council, which represents state lawmakers and offers guidance and model legislation for states to call a convention under the Constitution\u2019s Article V.\n\nAmong the most frequently cited changes being sought: amendments enforcing a balanced federal budget, establishing term limits for members of Congress, and repealing the 17th Amendment, which put the power of electing the Senate in the hands of the public instead of state legislatures.\n\nFor the past 229 years, constitutional amendments have originated in Congress, where they need the support of two-thirds of both houses, and then the approval of at least three-quarters of the states.\n\nBut under a never-used second prong of Article V, amendments can originate in the states. Two-thirds of states \u2014 currently, 34 \u2014 must call for a convention at which three-fourths of states approve of a change.\n\nThe particulars of such a convention, though, are not laid out. Do the states have to call for a convention on the same topic? Must they pass resolutions with similar or identical wording? The U.S. Supreme Court may have to decide whether the threshold of states has been reached and, ultimately, the parameters of a convention and the rules delegates would be governed by.\n\nA bill introduced in the U.S. House last year would direct the National Archives to compile all applications for an Article V convention.\n\nSome believe enough states have already passed Article V resolutions, pointing to votes over the years across the country on a variety of potential amendment topics. Others contend the highest possible current count of states is 28 \u2014 the number of states with existing resolutions on the most common convention topic, a balanced budget amendment. Others point to lower total counts based on states that have passed near-identical resolutions.\n\nRegardless, proponents of a convention believe they have momentum on their side more than any other time in American history.\n\n\u201cThat second clause of Article V was specifically intended for a time like this, when the federal government gets out of control and when the Congress won\u2019t deliver to the people what they want,\u201d said Mark Meckler, a tea party leader who now heads Citizens for Self-Governance, which runs the Convention of States Project calling for an Article V convention. Legislation promoted by the group calls for a convention focused on the federal government\u2019s budget and power, and term limits for office holders. It has passed 12 states and one legislative chamber in another 10.\n\nThe Convention of States Project says 18 other states are considering the measure.\n\nMeckler, like other backers of a convention, believes there\u2019s no reason why it can\u2019t be limited in scope. Others aren\u2019t so sure. Four states that previously had passed resolutions calling for a convention have rescinded them in recent years, often citing wariness over a \u201crunaway\u201d convention.\n\nKaren Hobert Flynn, president of Common Cause, has sounded alarms on a possible convention and portrays the coast-to-coast emergence of resolutions on the issue \u201ca game of Whack-a-Mole.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the most dangerous idea in American politics that most people know nothing about,\u201d she said.\n\nNancy MacLean, a Duke University historian and author of \u201cDemocracy in Chains: The Deep History of the Radical Right\u2019s Stealth Plan for America,\u201d views the prospect of an Article V convention with fear \u2014 the next chapter of decades of work on the far right transforming the federal judiciary and supporting cases that go on to make broad constitutional points, all while suppressing votes and gerrymandering districts.\n\n\u201cThe ultimate project,\u201d MacLean said of conservatives, \u201cis to transform our primary rules book, which is the Constitution.\u201d\n\nThere are proponents of an Article V convention on the left who see it as a possible way to overturn the Citizens United campaign finance decision, pass the Equal Rights Amendment and otherwise address what they see as a stacked deck that has helped the GOP get an unfair advantage. But with more red states than blue ones, it seems an unlikely path to abolishing the Electoral College, reengineering apportionment of the Senate or otherwise devising a democracy they believe is more reflective of the American public\u2019s views.\n\nIn that view, it\u2019s baffling to some observers that conservatives are the ones pushing a convention.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what exactly they\u2019re unhappy with. When I look at the current politics, it seems to me things for them are going really well,\u201d said constitutional law professor Michael Klarman of Harvard University. \u201cThey\u2019re already getting what they want from the Supreme Court. Gerrymandering is fine. Unlimited money in politics is fine. The Electoral College is OK. Voter purges, photo ID laws are OK. So I don\u2019t know exactly what they\u2019re looking for.\u201d\n\nMeckler acknowledges the loudest voices calling for a convention are conservative. (\u201cYou look at our website, it\u2019s all right-wingers,\u201d he says.) But he sees that as a reflection of a conservative culture in which the Constitution is more frequently discussed, not a reflection of the politics of it.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time a convention has been proposed.\n\nIn the 1890s, when the Senate refused to take up the issue of direct election of senators, states pursued a convention, falling just short. Eventually, the 17th Amendment passed in the usual way, fulfilling that aim. In the 1960s, states sought a convention over a Supreme Court decision dictating how legislative districts were apportioned.\n\nBut convention opponents have always feared that once one has been launched, it could tear up the Constitutions in all sorts of ways.\n\nWhat\u2019s to stop a convention from passing an abhorrent affront to the Founders, like an outright ban on Muslims, Klarman asks. He points to a 2009 Swiss referendum that resulted in outlawing the construction of minarets, the towers found beside mosques.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a dangerous route and an unpredictable one,\u201d said Laurence Tribe, another Harvard University constitutional law expert.\n\nJones said such fears are \u201cmisguided\u201d and that \u201cso many stopgaps\u201d would prevent a \u201crunaway\u201d convention.\n\n\u201cThat suggests a failure of institutions that is so massive that the last thing we need to worry about is a constitutional amendment,\u201d she said. \u201cThat would suggest that Congress failed in its duty to say, \u2018Look, you dealt with an issue that is not contained in the resolution.\u2019 That would require the judiciary to also not step in. It would require a failure of all of our democratic institutions and it would require a failure of the American people not to rise up.\u201d\n\nStill, several states have rescinded previous calls for a convention as lawmakers grew fearful of what it could bring.\n\nOver the years, Nevada lawmakers have made various calls for a convention to consider a ban on abortion, to prohibit racial integration of schools and to abolish the 17th Amendment.\n\nBut when Democratic state Sen. Tick Segerblom saw how close advocates were to hitting the 34-state mark, he realized the idea was no longer far-fetched and that it would be safer to back off its Article V votes rather than take the chance of a runaway convention. So last year, he sponsored a resolution to do just that.\n\nThe goals of convention backers \u201care not the Democratic Party\u2019s goals or even the Republican Party\u2019s goals,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s some fringe groups.\u201d\n\nIn fact, while some conservatives have voiced the greatest support for a convention, others strongly oppose it.\n\nAt an October hearing in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, Kim Stolfer of the gun rights group Firearms Owners Against Crime told lawmakers that the push for a convention \u201cscares the dickens out of me.\u201d Andy Schafly of the conservative Pennsylvania Eagle Forum called a convention \u201ca Pandora\u2019s box.\u201d\n\nA Republican who sponsored an Article V resolution and supports it so passionately that she calls it \u201cmy baby,\u201d Arizona state Rep.

(AP) \u2014 Overshadowed by an open governor\u2019s race and drowned out by the flood of ads in bare-knuckle congressional contests, control of Minnesota\u2019s Legislature is also up for grabs in Tuesday\u2019s election. But it\u2019s not something that all voters will notice.\n\nThe battle for the state House is being fought largely in the suburbs of Minneapolis and St. Paul, where Democrats hope a backlash against President Donald Trump and Republicans will help sweep them back into power for the first time since 2014. And control of the Senate rests solely with voters around the St. Cloud area, where a surprise special election has triggered a $1 million-plus affair that could tilt the majority back to Democrats.\n\nWith voters also picking Democratic Gov. Mark Dayton\u2019s replacement on Tuesday, the results will determine whether Minnesota government is in one party\u2019s hands or split. As they barnstorm to knock doors and host rallies, party chairs and candidates alike are urging supporters not to lose sight of those down-ballot races.\n\n\u201cFor all of us, legislative races are very important,\u201d Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party Chairman Ken Martin said. \u201cEveryone on the top of the ticket understands how important it is to win back the Legislature.\u201d\n\nControl of the Senate wasn\u2019t supposed to be at stake this year, since the chamber isn\u2019t up for re-election until 2020. But Dayton\u2019s decision to appoint Lt. Gov. Tina Smith to the U.S. Senate set off a chain reaction, eventually elevating Republican Sen. Michelle Fischbach to lieutenant governor. Fischbach resigned her Senate seat in late May, triggering the one-off election and leaving the Senate deadlocked 33-33.\n\nHer rural central Minnesota district is generally safe Republican territory \u2014 Fischbach won her last two terms by more than 25 percentage points, and Trump captured the district by nearly 34 points in 2016.\n\nBut with control of the Senate at stake, outside groups have spent $1 million and counting on mailers and ads. Democratic hopeful Joe Perske and Republican Rep. Jeff Howe have spent months knocking on doors of voters who have been written off as GOP supporters for years. Neither the Senate\u2019s top Republican nor its leading Democrat is declaring victory.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s knocked as many doors as you\u2019re ever going to knock,\u201d Democratic Senate Minority Leader Tom Bakk said.\n\nBoth are strong candidates. Howe has represented half the Senate district as House member for six years. Perske is a local county commissioner and former mayor of Sartell, a Democrat advertising his pro-gun and anti-abortion views \u2014 positions that play well in the area.\n\nRepublican Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka said that\u2019s complicated what\u2019s clearly a Republican district on paper. He makes the case to voters that a vote for Howe is a vote to retain a GOP majority.\n\n\u201cThere is no other vote. This is the deciding vote,\u201d he said.\n\nDemocrats would have to gain far more ground in the House to take control. They need to flip 11 districts. With all 134 House members on the ballot, Democrats have homed in on the suburbs, including 12 seats held by Republicans that Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton won in 2016.\n\nAt the top of the list is Edina, where GOP Rep. Dario Anselmo is fighting for a second term in a district that narrowly elected him in 2016 while swinging for Clinton by a landslide. Anselmo said he\u2019s playing up his \u201cpurple\u201d political philosophy with voters \u2014 he joined a Democratic lawmaker\u2019s protest on the House floor to call attention to the lack of action on gun legislation in the GOP-controlled House earlier this year.\n\nBut Democratic challenger Heather Edelson said Anselmo\u2019s similar stance on increasing gun restrictions isn\u2019t enough.\n\n\u201cHe stood up for those things, but he brought no Republicans with him.

Bill Nelson campaigns in Orlando. Florida Gov. Rick Scott has spent tens of millions of his own money. He has tried to make the election about Nelson's lengthy tenure in Washington, but instead he has been put on the defense over the environment, health care and his finances. (Joe Burbank/Orlando Sentinel via AP, File\n\nTALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Floridians could help determine control of the U.S. Senate on Tuesday as they decide whether to keep three-term incumbent Democrat Bill Nelson in office or replace him with Republican Gov. Rick Scott.\n\nNelson has been viewed as one of the nation\u2019s most vulnerable Democrats thanks to the formidable challenge from Scott, a multimillionaire businessman who has poured more than $60 million of his own fortune into the contest. A Nelson loss could make it difficult for Democrats to take back the Senate.\n\nWhile the two men differ on a range of issues ranging from gun control to health care, the election has been more about character and competence and the candidates\u2019 respective relationships with President Donald Trump.\n\nScott has urged voters to \u201cretire\u201d the 76-year-old Nelson, calling him ineffective and faulting him on everything from the level of federal support for the space program to the slow wait to get federal money to help repair the Lake Okeechobee dike.\n\n\u201cI work and he doesn\u2019t,\u201d said Scott. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t do anything. I don\u2019t know what he has done in 42 years of office.\u201d\n\nThat message has resonated with voters such as Ed Evangelista, who attended a Trump political rally this week in southwest Florida. He recently moved to the state after living in Connecticut for most of his 70 years.\n\nIn his home state, he said he voted for Democrats and Republicans. Now that he lives in Venice, Florida, he\u2019s casting his first ballot in the state for Scott.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been in way too long,\u201d Evangelista said of Nelson. \u201cI don\u2019t care if he\u2019s a good guy or not.\u201d\n\nNelson has responded by branding Scott as a Trump follower who has used the governor\u2019s office to pad his wealth and has ignored problems festering in the state. He has insisted Scott\u2019s actions to cut the budgets of water-management districts and limit enforcement actions at the state\u2019s environmental agency have contributed to the toxic algae and red tide that have plagued the coast this year. Nelson has also criticized Scott for opposing President Barack Obama\u2019s federal health care overhaul.\n\n\u201cThe campaign is about trust and integrity,\u201d Nelson said during a campaign swing through Tallahassee with Vice President Joe Biden. \u201cI think the choice is pretty clear. You just can\u2019t trust Rick Scott. He\u2019ll either change his position or he goes completely against the public interest.\u201d\n\nWhen Scott first decided to run, the contest between him and Nelson was seen as one of the marquee races in the nation, involving two heavyweights.\n\nBut that battle has been overshadowed by the governor\u2019s race, a vitriolic contest between Republican Ron DeSantis and Democrat Andrew Gillum that\u2019s been seen as a proxy battle between Trump and Democrats. Scott also spent nearly two weeks off the campaign trail to respond to Hurricane Michael, which pummeled several counties in the Florida Panhandle and was responsible for dozens of deaths.\n\nScott, a one-time health care executive, jumped into politics eight years ago and rode a tea party wave into the governor\u2019s office. He promised to enact stiff new policies to deal with immigration and was a loud critic of Obama. While in office, Scott backed away from his hard line on immigration and even came out in support of Medicaid expansion, although he changed that position once he was re-elected.\n\nThe 65-year-old governor planned to make the election a referendum on Nelson\u2019s tenure, but found himself playing defense over his own record and became the target of vocal protests at some of his campaign stops.\n\nThe governor also began widely airing a television ad promising to retain the Affordable Care Act\u2019s consumer protections for people with pre-existing conditions, even though Florida is one of the states involved in a lawsuit aimed at overturning the federal law. The governor has maintained he had nothing to do with the lawsuit, but he has not called for the state to withdraw from it.\n\nNelson and his allies ran ads questioning Scott\u2019s ethics, pointing to his ouster as chief executive of health care giant Columbia/HCA amid a federal fraud investigation. Although Scott was never charged with any wrongdoing, the health care conglomerate paid a then-record $1.7 billion fine for Medicare fraud.\n\nNelson, whose long political career included a stint as the state\u2019s insurance commissioner, has been put on the defensive this election season, as well, particularly over several public comments and statements.\n\nOver the summer he triggered a firestorm when he said the Russians were meddling in Florida\u2019s election system after an unsuccessful attempt in 2016. While top GOP senators would neither confirm nor deny Nelson\u2019s statement, federal authorities told Florida election officials they saw no signs of any \u201cnew or ongoing compromises\u201d of state or local election systems.\n\nMore recently, Nelson warned that the ongoing political strife in the nation could lead to the genocide that happened in the African nation of Rwanda, where nearly a million people were killed in the early \u201990s.", "County researching if it can donate to veterans shelter\n\nVICKSBURG, Miss.

(AP) \u2014 Pennsylvania voters will be in the middle of the national political picture when they cast ballots Tuesday, but many will undoubtedly also have issues closer to home on their mind as they consider contests for governor and state legislative seats.\n\nAt the top of the ballot, voters will decide whether Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf merits a second four-year term in office or if he should be replaced by Republican Scott Wagner, a former state senator who made millions in waste hauling.\n\nWolf, whose first run for office was his successful 2014 campaign, and Wagner, who has closely associated himself with President Donald Trump, both hail from York County.\n\n\u201cIf anyone were to tell you that this election on Tuesday was not the most important election in your life, they\u2019d be lying to you, because it is,\u201d Wolf told a crowd of more than 500 on Sunday evening at Harrisburg\u2019s Pennsylvania Farm Show Complex.\n\nWolf has closed his campaign by warning that he is the last line of defense against an opponent, Wagner, who is hostile to Pennsylvania\u2019s Medicaid expansion, funding for public schools and labor unions. His campaign has framed the brash Wagner as being unfit for office, highlighting Wagner\u2019s comments in a video streamed online last month advising Wolf to put on a catcher\u2019s mask because \u201cI\u2019m going to stomp all over your face with golf spikes.\u201d\n\nShould he win, Wagner, a Republican, would likely have Republican majorities to work with in the state Legislature.\n\nWagner, meanwhile, has closed his campaign echoing Trump\u2019s hard-edged message on illegal immigration, accusing Wolf of being soft on illegal immigrants and sanctuary cities and opposing sending troops to the border for the migrant caravan making its way north in Mexico. Wagner warns that Wolf will raise taxes while he is pledging to cut taxes, eliminate property taxes and rein in an out-of-control state government.\n\nWolf has maintained a comfortable lead in the polls, as has U.S. Sen. Bob Casey, a second-term Democrat from Scranton being challenged by another Republican candidate closely identified with Trump, four-term U.S. Rep. Lou Barletta.\n\nCasey, in his seventh statewide race, is the son of Pennsylvania\u2019s late former two-term governor, Bob Casey Sr. He is endorsed by labor unions and environmental advocacy groups, and has been a staunch critic of Trump.\n\nBarletta, the former Hazleton mayor, is one of Trump\u2019s strongest allies in Congress. Barletta is backed by business trade associations and anti-abortion groups, and is one of Congress\u2019 most prominent voices against illegal immigration.\n\nThe significance of Pennsylvania\u2019s swing voters is magnified this year, after the state Supreme Court redrew a Republican-crafted map of congressional districts that had produced durable 13-5 GOP majorities in the state\u2019s U.S. House delegation.\n\nAlong with the court\u2019s more competitive map of districts, the most open U.S. House seats in Pennsylvania in decades \u2014 seven \u2014 are fueling a big pool of competitive races as Democrats nationally seek to wipe out the 23-seat Republican majority.\n\nA Democratic House would be a major blow to Trump\u2019s agenda, which has so far been aided by GOP control in both chambers. Democrats are also expected to send as many as four women to the U.S. House, breaking up the state\u2019s all-male delegation since 2014.\n\nRepublicans are widely expected to lose two open seats in the Philadelphia suburbs and a third in Allentown. Three House Republicans find themselves in particularly difficult re-election contests: Brian Fitzpatrick in suburban Philadelphia, Scott Perry in the Harrisburg-York area and Keith Rothfus in suburban Pittsburgh.\n\nIn the Legislature, all 203 House seats are up, along with half the 50 Senate districts. Republicans have been on a winning streak in legislative races going back several cycles, leaving them with commanding majorities in both chambers, 121-82 in the House and 34-16 in the Senate.\n\nFor Republicans, that means they have more territory to defend. Democrats have positioned themselves to capitalize if the much-discussed \u201cblue wave\u201d of Democratic votes materializes on Tuesday.\n\nPolls in Pennsylvania are open from 7 a.m.-8 p.m. The state currently has about 4.1 million registered Democrats, 3.3 million Republicans and 1.2 million who are independent or with some other party.\n\nSlightly more than a quarter of registered voters are 34 and younger, the same proportion as in the 2010 mid-term election.

The jury couldn\u2019t reach a verdict in 2017 and the government dropped the case this year.\n\nBut the case led the Senate Ethics Committee to admonish Menendez and say he brought discredit upon the chamber. Menendez has consistently denied any wrongdoing, though in the weeks before the election, he apologized to voters. He urged them to focus on his decades of public service, including his work drafting the Affordable Care Act, and return him to office.\n\nHugin, a wealthy former executive at drugmaker Celgene, has tapped his own funds for more than $30 million to finance TV ads to portray Menendez as corrupt. The torrent of cash has put Menendez on the defensive in a state where Democrats have over 900,000 more voters than Republicans.\n\nA super PAC tied to Senate Democrats promised $3 million to help, and another outside group that has attacked Hugin over his firm\u2019s raising prices of a cancer drug has spent seven figures as well.\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s low approval rating in the state could buoy Menendez.

Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., speaks during a campaign rally Wednesday, Oct. 31, 2018, in Bridgeton, Mo. McCaskill is running for re-election. (AP Photo/Jeff Roberson)\n\nCOLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) \u2014 Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill has approvingly evoked former President Ronald Reagan. She said she would back President Donald Trump if he stopped a migrant caravan at the border. And speaking on Fox News, she has decried \u201ccrazy Democrats.\u201d\n\nWhat is the Democratic senator up to?\n\nThe vulnerable incumbent is appealing to the right in a bid to win a third term in a state that Trump won by 19 percentage points in 2016.\n\nShe\u2019s betting a more centrist message will resonate with independents and moderate Republican voters she desperately needs to beat Republican challenger Josh Hawley, who has relentlessly attacked her as too liberal for the conservative leaning state.\n\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s not about fighting the president every day,\u201d she told a group of supporters gathered at an iconic Missouri pizza parlor called Shakespeare\u2019s Pizza in the college town of Columbia. \u201cIt\u2019s about fighting for you every day.\u201d\n\nMcCaskill\u2019s messaging prompted Trump to say sarcastically during a Thursday rally in Columbia, Missouri, that: \u201cI didn\u2019t know she was a Republican.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s among 10 Democratic Senate incumbents up for re-election in states the president won, and Republicans see Missouri as a prime opportunity to flip a seat and build on their now slim 51-49 majority in the Senate.\n\nSo, during a late October debate McCaskill praised Republican icon Reagan for working to unite the country when he was president in the 1980s.\n\nShe accepted an interview with Fox News, which in itself is unusual for a Democrat, and on Monday criticized \u201ccrazy Democrats\u201d who \u201cwalk in restaurants and scream in elected officials\u2019 faces.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not somebody who thinks that we should ever be uncivil,\u201d McCaskill said. \u201cI think what most Missourians want is for us to listen to each other, figure out where we can compromise, not scream in each other\u2019s faces (and) not call each other names.\u201d\n\nShe avoided calling any of her Senate Democratic colleagues crazy but noted that she has clashed with Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren and disagrees with Sen. Bernie Sanders on a number of issues.\n\nAsked in the same Fox interview about the caravan of migrants making its way through Mexico, McCaskill said:\n\n\u201cStop it at the border. I think the president has to use every tool he has at his disposal and I\u2019ll 100 percent back him up on that.\u201d\n\nHawley scoffs at such talk from McCaskill, who he called a \u201cliberal Democrat, for darn sure.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe votes with (Sen.) Chuck Schumer almost 90 percent of the time, she voted against Justice (Brett) Kavanaugh, against Justice (Neil) Gorsuch, against middle-class tax cuts, against border security,\u201d Hawley said Saturday at a Columbia campaign stop. \u201cShe\u2019s against standing up to China and trade cheaters. I mean any issue that\u2019s important to Missourians, she\u2019s with her party down the line.\u201d\n\nHawley tied his campaign to Trump and has embraced the president throughout his campaign, although he\u2019s been careful not to adopt Trump\u2019s incendiary rhetoric.\n\nHe got some conservative backup from National Rifle Association President Oliver North, who campaigned for him Saturday in Imperial, Missouri, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) south of St. Louis. The NRA endorsed Hawley and aired ads against McCaskill, even as the organization nationally adopted a lower profile in this year\u2019s high-stakes midterms as the dynamics shift in the gun debate.\n\nA check of McCaskill\u2019s record shows that she votes with the president about half the time, though she has opposed him on some of the biggest votes including both of his Supreme Court nominees, Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch.\n\nTrump said that McCaskill had been \u201csaying such nice things about me. But you know what? She\u2019ll never vote with me. That\u2019s the problem.\u201d\n\nSome voters don\u2019t seem sold on McCaskill\u2019s message, either.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a hardcore conservative, and she\u2019s a hardcore liberal even though she\u2019s trying to hide it,\u201d said Jeff Ferry, a 50-year-old antique store owner from Perry, Missouri who traveled to Columbia to see the president speak. When asked who he will pick for Senate, he said \u201cit sure won\u2019t be Claire McCaskill.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "BOSTON (AP) \u2014 Besides casting ballots for the two top tier races in Massachusetts \u2014 governor and U.S. senate \u2014 voters will be deciding the winners of four other statewide offices on Tuesday\u2019s ballot.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the races for attorney general, secretary of state, treasurer and auditor. In the general election, the candidates for lieutenant governor run as a team with the candidate for governor from their party.\n\n___\n\nAttorney General:\n\nIncumbent Democratic Attorney General Maura Healey is running for a second four-year term. She\u2019s facing a challenge from Republican Jay McMahon, an attorney from Cape Cod.\n\nThe two have taken opposing views on a range of topics.\n\nMcMahon faulted Healey for her 2016 crackdown on \u201ccopy\u201d or \u201cduplicate\u201d assault weapons. Healey has defended her decision, saying she was just enforcing the state\u2019s existing assault weapons ban.\n\nThe two also clashed on the state\u2019s 2016 transgender rights law, which is the subject of a repeal effort Tuesday. The law in part guarantees transgender people can use restrooms and locker rooms that correspond with their gender identities.\n\nHealey supports the law, calling it an important guarantee of the rights of transgender people. McMahon said the law doesn\u2019t include enough protections against those who might use it to gain access to bathrooms or locker rooms for illicit purposes.\n\n___\n\nSecretary of State:\n\nThe longest-serving statewide office-holder on the ballot \u2014 Secretary of State William Galvin \u2014 is seeking another four-year term. He\u2019s being challenged by Republican Anthony Amore and Green-Rainbow candidate Juan Sanchez.\n\nGalvin and Amore have split on whether the state should let residents register to vote and cast a ballot on the same day.\n\nGalvin said he supports same-day voter registration. Amore said he\u2019s against the proposal, saying he\u2019s not convinced it could be done securely.\n\nThe two also differed on a new state system that will automatically update a person\u2019s voter registration when that person notifies a state agency like the Registry of Motor Vehicles of a new address or other change in their voter status.\n\nAmore said he\u2019s concerned about the new system. Galvin backs it.\n\nGalvin has held the office since 1995. Amore works as director of security at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston.\n\n___\n\nTreasurer:\n\nDemocratic incumbent state Treasurer Deb Goldberg is hoping to fend off a challenge from Republican state Rep. Keiko Orrall and Green-Rainbow Party candidate Jamie Guerin as she seeks another four-year term.\n\nOn nearly every issue, Orrall has argued the state can do better than under the leadership of Goldberg, including the treasury\u2019s unclaimed property division, which helps people search for forgotten savings and checking accounts, and the contents of unattended safe deposit boxes.\n\nOrrall says Goldberg hasn\u2019t worked hard enough to return the money. Goldberg\u2019s office said the state returned about $118 million in unclaimed property in the 2018 fiscal year, up from the $100 million during the previous fiscal year.\n\nThe two also sparred about online lottery sale.\n\nGoldberg said moving the lottery online is inevitable. Orrall is more skeptical, saying online lottery sales could hurt stores that rely on selling lottery tickets.\n\n___\n\nAuditor:\n\nThe auditor may have the lowest profile of any statewide office. This year, it also has the most crowded field of candidates.\n\nDemocratic incumbent auditor Suzanne Bump is facing three challengers \u2014 Republican Helen Brady, Libertarian Daniel Fishman and Green-Rainbow candidate Edward Stamas.\n\nBump, who\u2019s seeking a third four-year term, said she sees her job as ensuring that government has the confidence of citizens.\n\nShe\u2019s been criticized at times, such as in September when Republican Gov. Charlie Baker challenged her office\u2019s conclusion that the Registry of Motor Vehicles had issued more than 1,900 drivers\u2019 licenses under the names of dead people.\n\nBrady is the business manager for the Boston Pops and has worked for the Boston Symphony Orchestra for 30 years.

Facebook and other social platforms have been waging a fight against online misinformation and hate speech for two years. With the U.S. midterm elections coming soon on Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2018, there are signs that they're making some headway, although they're still a long way from winning the war. (AP Photo/John Minchillo, File)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Facebook and other social platforms have been fighting online misinformation and hate speech for two years. With the U.S. midterm elections just a few days away, there are signs that they\u2019re making some headway, although they\u2019re still a very long way from winning the war.\n\nThat\u2019s because the effort risks running into political headwinds that Facebook, Twitter and Google find bad for business. Some even argue that the social networks are easy to flood with disinformation by design \u2014 an unintended consequence of their eagerness to cater to advertisers by categorizing the interests of their users.\n\nCaught embarrassingly off-guard after they were played by Russian agents meddling with the 2016 U.S. elections, the technology giants have thrown millions of dollars, tens of thousands of people and what they say are their best technical efforts into fighting fake news, propaganda and hate that has proliferated on their digital platforms.\n\nFacebook, in particular, has pulled a major reversal since late 2016, when CEO Mark Zuckerberg infamously dismissed the idea that fake news on his service could have swayed the election as \u201cpretty crazy.\u201d In July, for instance, the company announced that heavy spending on security and content moderation, coupled with other business shifts, would hold down growth and profitability. Investors immediately panicked and knocked $119 billion off the company\u2019s market value.\n\nThe social network has started to see some payoff for its efforts. A research collaboration between New York University and Stanford recently found that user \u201cinteractions\u201d with fake news stories on Facebook, which rose substantially in 2016 during the presidential campaign, fell significantly between the end of 2016 and July 2018. On Twitter, however, the sharing of such stories continued to rise over the past two years.\n\nA similar measure from the University of Michigan\u2019s Center for Social Media Responsibility dubbed the \u201dIffy Quotient \u201d \u2014 which gauges the prevalence of \u201ciffy\u201d material on social networks \u2014 also shows that Facebook\u2019s \u201ciffiness\u201d has fallen from a high of 8.1 percent 1n March 2017 to 3.2 percent on Monday. Twitter iffiness has also fallen slightly, from 5.6% in November 2016, to 4.2 percent on Monday.\n\nEven at these levels, fake news remains huge and may be spreading to new audiences. A team led by Philip Howard, the lead researcher on Oxford\u2019s Computational Propaganda effort, looked at stories shared on Twitter during the last 10 days of September 2018 and found that what it called \u201cjunk news\u201d accounted for a full quarter of all links shared during that time \u2014 greater than the number of professional news stories shared during that time.\n\nThe team defined junk news as sources that published deceptive or incorrect information, often in an ideological or conspiratorial way, while failing to meet criteria such as professionalism, bias, credibility and style.\n\nWhile the Oxford analysis didn\u2019t produce similar figures for Facebook, the researchers did map out how junk news circulates on the social network and found that conspiracy theories and other misinformation once confined to a \u201chard right\u201d audience are now shared more freely among mainstream conservatives as well. (Left-leaning users have also developed a taste for junk news, the Oxford team found, but it represents only a small fraction of the material they share on Facebook.)\n\nSuch studies offer imperfect pictures of what\u2019s actually happening on social networks, since the services typically don\u2019t offer researchers untrammeled access to their data. Twitter, for instance, takes issue with the Oxford study, noting that it used a public feed of tweets that doesn\u2019t reflect the filtering Twitter does to remove malicious or spammy material.\n\nTamping down misinformation, of course, is anything but easy. Adversaries are always finding new ways around restrictions. It can also be hard to distinguish misinformation and propaganda from legitimate news, especially when world leaders such as President Donald Trump are regularly disseminating falsehoods on social media.\n\nPolitics also complicates matters, since the social-media companies are anxious to avoid charges of political bias. When Facebook, Google\u2019s YouTube and, eventually, Twitter all banned the conspiracymonger Alex Jones for various violations of their terms of service, Jones and his allies immediately claimed he was being censored. President Trump chimed in a few weeks later with a parallel charge, claiming without evidence that Google and other companies were \u201csuppressing voices of Conservatives and hiding information and news that is good.\u201d\n\nTwitter, in fact, charges that researchers such as the Oxford team define \u201cjunk news\u201d too broadly. The group, for instance, classes conservative sites such as Breitbart News and the Daily Caller as \u201cjunk\u201d by its criteria. Twitter argues that banning \u201cmedia outlets that reflect views within American society\u201d would \u201cseverely hinder public debate.\u201d\n\nSome critics charge that the very advertising-based business model that made Zuckerberg rich is also perfectly suited for propagandists. Services like Facebook and Twitter \u201csustain themselves by finding like-minded groups and selling information about their behavior,\u201d Dipayan Ghosh, a former privacy policy expert at Facebook and Ben Scott, senior adviser at New America, wrote in a Time Magazine op-ed earlier this year. \u201cDisinformation propagators sustain themselves by manipulating the behavior of like-minded groups.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t self-regulate,\u201d said Dora Kingsley Vertenten, a professor of public policy at the University of Southern California and CEO of research consulting firm Trenton West. \u201cThey just want to make a profit, and what they have done to date is not nearly enough.\u201d\n\nReally fixing the misinformation problem might require big changes to how these services work. Users started spending less time on Facebook after it made changes to make its service more \u201cmeaningful\u201d to users, involving less scrolling through posts and more interactions with friends, the company said.\n\nTwitter CEO Jack Dorsey has hinted that he is open to drastic changes , but he hasn\u2019t yet said what they might look like. And there haven\u2019t been any obvious shifts since he made that statement in August.", "OMAHA, Neb.

When the name of the place you hold dear suddenly becomes synonymous with tragedy, the emotional impact can be searing and the aftereffects can linger for months, years, even generations. (AP Photo/Charles Krupa)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 As the neighborhood where she grew up became national news, as the synagogue where her bat mitzvah took place 37 years ago became the font of a thousand unwelcome tears, Sarah Bloom watched TV \u2014 and listened.\n\nWhat she heard as she sat in her Florida home last weekend made her very sad: news anchors discussing what \u201cSquirrel Hill\u201d means to the national political debate. Talking heads analyzing what implications \u201cPittsburgh\u201d will have on anti-Semitic activity in the United States. The names of her hometown and beloved neighborhood, suddenly a national shorthand for bloodshed and heartbreak.\n\n\u201cIf you hurt Pittsburgh, you hurt me. If you hurt Squirrel Hill, you kill me,\u201d said a still disbelieving Bloom, 49, who lives a few miles from the site of the Parkland shooting eight months ago. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t fit \u2014 Orlando, Sandy Hook, Las Vegas, Pittsburgh. Not my city. Take that out of there.\u201d\n\nShanksville and Newtown. Waco and Charlottesville and Aurora. Kent State and Columbine and Lockerbie and Oklahoma City. Pearl Harbor and Hiroshima. And now: Pittsburgh and Squirrel Hill.\n\nWhen the name of the place you hold dear suddenly becomes synonymous with tragedy, the emotional impact can be searing and the aftereffects can linger for months, years, even generations.\n\n\u201cCharlottesville is now known for the tiki-torch carriers,\u201d says Waki Wynn, 47, a private-school athletic director in the Virginia town where a \u201cUnite the Right\u201d march last year drew white supremacists and led to violence. The events etched the name of his community indelibly onto the national psyche.\n\nUnsurprisingly, there\u2019s a term for this: metonymy, or using a word as a stand-in for what it represents. We do it a lot in America, and to some extent it\u2019s natural. A busy society with complicated ideas to express needs shorthand sometimes.\n\nThus we say we have problems with \u201cWashington\u201d (the American government). When baseball players talk of making it to Cooperstown, they\u2019re talking not just about the community but the larger notion of baseball immortality. And when astronauts out in space reach out to \u201cHouston,\u201d it\u2019s not the city where Mission Control is located but the institution where problems can be solved.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a way of encapsulating a whole series of ideas that are complex, that we don\u2019t have to explain,\u201d says linguist Alan Juffs, who heads the English Language Institute at the University of Pittsburgh.\n\nBut it is tragedy that seems to repurpose place names into monikers for traumatic events most freely, and our modern, quick-draw media society has only accelerated this.\n\n\u201cSquirrel Hill has become one point on a long continuum of increasingly common moments like this,\u201d says Robert Hayashi, an associate professor of American studies at Amherst College who studies how stories about places shape local identity.\n\n\u201cThose place names become a kind of simplistic kind of label for this kind of event that doesn\u2019t allow us to delve into the history and context behind it,\u201d says Hayashi, a Pittsburgh native. \u201cPeople can talk about their community, but it gets overwritten by this larger narrative.\u201d\n\nBigger towns where bad things happen don\u2019t suffer this syndrome the same way because their identity, to the rest of the country and world, is much more multifaceted.\n\nSay \u201cNew York\u201d today and no one will think of 9/11 as they do with Shanksville, the crash site of United Flight 93. And \u201cLas Vegas\u201d doesn\u2019t only mean \u201cmass shooting\u201d a year after the worst one by a single assailant in the country\u2019s history took place there. Same with Orlando, which still means \u201cDisney\u201d more than it does \u201cnightclub massacre.\u201d\n\nEven \u201cPittsburgh\u201d is a big enough, familiar enough place that it will likely regain its status as a city, rather than an event, in relatively short order.\n\nBut with smaller towns and schools \u2014 or, in the uniquely named Squirrel Hill\u2019s case, a distinct part of a larger town \u2014 it is harder to shake the reputation.\n\nKent State and Columbine, both names of schools, remain stand-ins for larger social issues. The communities of Auschwitz and Dachau will never shed global recognition for what happened there during World War II, though Auschwitz\u2019s reversion to its original Polish name, Oswiecim, was a step in that direction. Same story for the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki; in the West, at least, they remain metaphors for atomic devastation.\n\nSometimes the name of an entire nation is the traumatic event. In Hanoi in 2015, a senior Vietnamese journalist leaned over a table toward a visiting American speaker. \u201cI look forward,\u201d he said, \u201cto the day when you hear the word \u2018Vietnam\u2019 and you think of a country, not a war.\u201d\n\nHow do communities move on? Time helps, but not always.\n\nPearl Harbor will still mean a day of infamy a century from now. The upstate New York neighborhood of Love Canal, virtually wiped out today, will forever be synonymous with toxic waste.

This past week, after many successful years, Detroit abandoned \u201cAngel\u2019s Night\u201d in favor of its new, if slightly precious, replacement: \u201cHalloween in the D.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was a community redefining a moment for itself.

Charlottesville, he says, is not perfect when it comes to race \u2014 but it\u2019s a good place to live. \u201cSo when they respond that way, it gives me a chance to say how wonderful Charlottesville is.

The state is arguing that Turner is a sexually violent person and suffers from mental disorders.\n\nTurner was convicted for the Oct. 31, 1973 rape and murder of Lisa Ann French, a 9-year-old who went trick-or-treating that evening in Turner\u2019s Fond du Lac neighborhood. The girl\u2019s body was found days later in a garbage bag along a rural road outside the city.\n\nTuner received a 38-year sentence, but he has been released from prison twice during that time.\n\nTurner was a friend of the French family, who now want him to remain locked up for life so he can\u2019t hurt another child.\n\nLisa\u2019s mother, Maryann Gehring, and sister, Susan De Pauw, have been petitioning online to stop his release.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing he is still locked up and not out on the streets,\u201d Gehring said. \u201cI would just like to get this over with once and for all.\u201d\n\nTurner\u2019s public defenders have requested that his case be transferred from Fond du Lac County to Dane County, where he lived when his parole was revoked in 2003.

Those districts figure prominently in the party\u2019s national strategy to seize at least 23 seats on Election Day to retake control of the House.\n\nIn the closely fought suburbs of the 45th District, comedian Chelsea Handler kicked off a rally for U.S. House candidate Katie Porter, who is trying to unseat Republican Rep. Mimi Walters.\n\nThe boisterous rally in a hotel ballroom was headlined by Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, the Democratic candidate for governor, who described the election as a proxy vote on President Donald Trump\u2019s administration.\n\nHe urged the crowd to send a message to the president about his agenda: \u201cWe reject it,\u201d he said, setting off a thunderous cheer.\n\nPorter, a law school professor, said Walters had turned her back on the county and its residents, pointing to her votes against the Affordable Care Act. \u201cShow her the door,\u201d she told them.\n\nA similar urgency was on display in the nearby 39th District, where Republican Young Kim is in a toss-up contest with Democrat Gil Cisneros for the seat being vacated by Republican Rep.

The cubs were right behind the mama bear, and it was like, \u2018Holy cow. OK, I\u2019m gone.\u2019\u201d\n\nJudging on his usual demeanor, he was probably smiling, even as he faced the bear.\n\nAsk most people in the downtown neighborhoods the first thing they think of with Ebron and they\u2019ll probably say his smile. After 33 years of that smile being a downtown staple, Ebron is retiring this Wednesday at the age of 62.\n\nHis joyous laugh changes to a bit of an embarrassed one when you call him a celebrity, but he\u2019s become one of the most recognizable people in the neighborhood. He recalled when his sister visited from Boston once and was shocked at how many people knew him by name.\n\n\u201cMan, you can be a politician around here,\u201d she told him. \u201cYou know pretty much everyone.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s quite the change from his first visit to Juneau.\n\nOriginally from the Philippines, Ebron came from a family of musicians. His father was a professional drummer, and Ebron grew up playing the piano. He ended up playing piano on a cruise ship, which brought him to Juneau. He still plays piano in the Juneau Big Band, also called the Thunder Mountain Band, and said he sees people from his route in the audience from time to time.\n\nAs is the case with so many short-term visitors to Juneau, Ebron fell in love \u2014 with a woman named Lourdes who was also from the Philippines \u2014 and ended up moving to the capital city for good. The two of them got married and now have two sons, who have moved to California and Oregon. Lourdes, a former state employee, is currently retired.\n\nEbron moved to Juneau in 1982 and in 1985 he took the job with the Postal Service. Within a year, he was assigned to the downtown route.\n\nSince then, all of his trademarks have become as synonymous with the neighborhood as the street names: His all-weather helmet, his laugh, his truck being parked in the same places and of course, his Postal Service cape.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got my very popular cape,\u201d Ebron said. \u201cPeople love my cape.\u201d\n\nEbron has to work in all of the precipitation that Juneau has to offer \u2014 rain, sleet and snowstorms \u2014 and said he always wears layers and has all of his equipment in his truck and ready to go.

Another wrote that Ebron was the only one to purchase the lemonade she tried to sell when she was younger.\n\n\u201cHe really cared about the people he served every day for more than 30 years,\u201d Richardson said in an email. \u201cHe was a constant in our lives. If I was feeling down, just seeing him smile and stop for a moment on his route was uplifting.\u201d\n\nRichardson took the Facebook comments and included them in a birthday card for Ebron a couple weeks ago. She also gave him a Starr Hill mug.\n\nEbron said the messages from the neighbors were meaningful, and he hopes to still see them around town.\n\n\u201cI really appreciate all their well wishes for me and I\u2019ll miss them all,\u201d Ebron said. \u201cMore than half of my life has been doing this job.

Thad Cochran, who retired earlier this year. Although the race is nonpartisan and party labels won\u2019t appear on the ballot, it features two Republicans and two Democrats, and could result in a Nov. 27 runoff.\n\nGov. Phil Bryant appointed Cindy Hyde-Smith, then the state\u2019s Agriculture Commissioner, to fill the vacancy, and the GOP\u2019s Hyde-Smith has stuck close to President Donald Trump, winning his endorsement. Also running is Republican state Sen. Chris McDaniel, who nearly knocked off Cochran in a 2014 primary, only to see Cochran escape defeat in a runoff partly by appealing to Democrats.\n\nOn the Democratic side, former U.S. Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy is trying to pull off an upset that could have national implications in a closely divided Senate. Another Democrat and former military intelligence officer, Tobey Bernard Bartee, is also running.\n\nThat closely watched race won\u2019t be all, though. Also on the ballot is incumbent U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker, who\u2019s seeking re-election to another full six-year term in the seat he\u2019s held since December 2007. Wicker is challenged by Democratic state Rep. David Baria. Libertarian Danny Bedwell and Reform Party member Sean O\u2019Hara are also seeking Wicker\u2019s seat.\n\nOther races include:\n\nU.S. HOUSE 3rd DISTRICT\n\nMississippians will elect a new member of Congress in the 3rd District.\n\nRepublican District Attorney Michael Guest of Brandon is squaring off against Democratic state House member Michael Ted Evans of Preston and Reform Party member Matthew Holland.\n\nThe 3rd District runs across 24 counties from Natchez through the Jackson suburbs and farther northeast to Starkville. The retiring Gregg Harper, like Guest a Rankin County Republican, has represented the area for 10 years.\n\nWinning a competitive primary, Guest supports higher infrastructure spending, immigration changes, and more consumer choice in health care.\n\nEvans is a populist but conservative Democrat who voices distaste for Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi and opposes abortion. He opposes Trump\u2019s trade policies and supports broader health coverage.\n\nU.S. HOUSE 1st DISTRICT\n\nRepublican U.S. Rep Trent Kelly is seeking a second full term in a north Mississippi congressional seat, opposed by Democrat Randy Wadkins and Reform Party member Tracella Lou O\u2019Hara Hill.\n\nThe 22-county 1st District stretches from suburbs of Memphis, Tennessee, to Tupelo and Columbus.\n\nKelly, a former district attorney, first won election to Congress in 2015 after U.S. Rep. Alan Nunnelee died. Kelly has heavily outraised Wadkins, a University of Mississippi chemistry professor.\n\nA Mississippi National Guard general, Kelly emphasizes support for higher military spending. He also wants to keep decreasing regulations and supports Trump on trade, saying other countries trade unfairly with the United States.\n\nWadkins entered the race citing disagreements with Kelly and Trump, especially over health care. Wadkins supported plans for government-funded health insurance for all Americans.\n\nU.S. HOUSE 2nd DISTRICT\n\nThe state\u2019s only Democrat in Congress, Rep. Bennie Thompson of Bolton, is aiming for a 13th full term in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nHe\u2019s running against independent Troy Ray and Reform Party candidate Irving Harris in the 2nd District which spans 26 counties including the Mississippi Delta and parts of Jackson.\n\nA Hinds County supervisor before he was first elected in 1993, the 70-year-old Thompson could reclaim the chair of the House Homeland Security Committee if Democrats win the majority in the House.\n\nU.S. HOUSE 4th DISTRICT\n\nU.S. Rep. Steven Palazzo, a Republican, is seeking to a fifth term in south Mississippi, opposed by Democratic state Rep. Jeramey Anderson and Reform Party member Lajena Sheets.\n\nThe 4th District covers 14 counties from Laurel to the Gulf Coast.\n\nPalazzo touts support for military spending, in a district where the largest employer is military shipbuilder Ingalls Shipbuilding. He argues he\u2019s building seniority and that voters should re-elect him to support President Donald Trump.\n\nAnderson calls for broader health coverage, an increased minimum wage, and less punitive criminal sentencing.\n\nPalazzo has raised nearly $700,000 since 2017 began, compared to $131,000 for Anderson.\n\nCOURT OF APPEALS\n\nVoters in two districts in the western half of the state will get a chance to elect new members to eight-year terms on the state Court of Appeals.\n\nThe court races are nonpartisan, and if no one wins a majority Tuesday, runoffs would be held Nov. 27.\n\nIn the 2nd District in the Mississippi Delta and parts of Jackson, candidates include Eric Hawkins of Greenville; Ceola James of Vicksburg; and Deborah McDonald of Fayette.\n\nMcDonald raised more than $30,000, the most of the three. She cites experience as a municipal court judge and lawyer for government agencies in southwest Mississippi.\n\nJames served four years on the court before losing to Latrice Westbrooks. Hawkins has been Washington County prosecutor since 2007 and Greenville city prosecutor since 1999.\n\nIn the 2nd District in southwest Mississippi and parts of Jackson, the candidates are Hinds County Circuit Judge Jeff Weill of Jackson, David McCarty of Jackson, and Byron Carter of Byram.\n\nWeill, previously a Republican member of the Jackson City Council, raised nearly $150,000. Although technically running without a party label, Weill was endorsed by the state GOP.\n\nMcCarty raised more than $125,000. Endorsed by some Democrats, McCarty says he has more experience arguing cases before Mississippi\u2019s appellate courts.\n\nCarter raised little money, but says varied legal experience qualifies him.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "CROWN POINT, Ind.

But under a never-used second prong of Article V, amendments can originate in the states. (National Archives via AP)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Whatever success Republicans have amassed in taking control of all three branches of U.S. government, and whatever fate awaits them as midterm elections near, some on the right are working to cement change by amending the Constitution. And to the mounting alarm of others on all parts of the spectrum, they want to bypass the usual process.\n\nThey\u2019re pushing for an unprecedented Constitutional convention of the states. While opponents are afraid of what such a convention would do, supporters say it is the only way to deal with the federal government\u2019s overreach and ineptitude.\n\n\u201cThey literally see this as the survival of the nation,\u201d said Karla Jones, director of the federalism task force at the conservative American Legislative Exchange Council, which represents state lawmakers and offers guidance and model legislation for states to call a convention under the Constitution\u2019s Article V.\n\nAmong the most frequently cited changes being sought: amendments enforcing a balanced federal budget, establishing term limits for members of Congress, and repealing the 17th Amendment, which put the power of electing the Senate in the hands of the public instead of state legislatures.\n\nFor the past 229 years, constitutional amendments have originated in Congress, where they need the support of two-thirds of both houses, and then the approval of at least three-quarters of the states.\n\nBut under a never-used second prong of Article V, amendments can originate in the states. Two-thirds of states \u2014 currently, 34 \u2014 must call for a convention at which three-fourths of states approve of a change.\n\nThe particulars of such a convention, though, are not laid out. Do the states have to call for a convention on the same topic? Must they pass resolutions with similar or identical wording? The U.S. Supreme Court may have to decide whether the threshold of states has been reached and, ultimately, the parameters of a convention and the rules delegates would be governed by.\n\nA bill introduced in the U.S. House last year would direct the National Archives to compile all applications for an Article V convention.\n\nSome believe enough states have already passed Article V resolutions, pointing to votes over the years across the country on a variety of potential amendment topics. Others contend the highest possible current count of states is 28 \u2014 the number of states with existing resolutions on the most common convention topic, a balanced budget amendment. Others point to lower total counts based on states that have passed near-identical resolutions.\n\nRegardless, proponents of a convention believe they have momentum on their side more than any other time in American history.\n\n\u201cThat second clause of Article V was specifically intended for a time like this, when the federal government gets out of control and when the Congress won\u2019t deliver to the people what they want,\u201d said Mark Meckler, a tea party leader who now heads Citizens for Self-Governance, which runs the Convention of States Project calling for an Article V convention. Legislation promoted by the group calls for a convention focused on the federal government\u2019s budget and power, and term limits for office holders. It has passed 12 states and one legislative chamber in another 10.\n\nThe Convention of States Project says 18 other states are considering the measure.\n\nMeckler, like other backers of a convention, believes there\u2019s no reason why it can\u2019t be limited in scope. Others aren\u2019t so sure. Four states that previously had passed resolutions calling for a convention have rescinded them in recent years, often citing wariness over a \u201crunaway\u201d convention.\n\nKaren Hobert Flynn, president of Common Cause, has sounded alarms on a possible convention and portrays the coast-to-coast emergence of resolutions on the issue \u201ca game of Whack-a-Mole.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the most dangerous idea in American politics that most people know nothing about,\u201d she said.\n\nThere are proponents of an Article V convention on the left who see it as a possible way to overturn the Citizens United campaign finance decision, pass the Equal Rights Amendment and otherwise address what they see as a stacked deck that has helped the GOP get an unfair advantage. But with more red states than blue ones, it seems an unlikely path to abolishing the Electoral College, reengineering apportionment of the Senate or otherwise devising a democracy they believe is more reflective of the American public\u2019s views.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time a convention has been proposed.\n\nIn the 1890s, when the Senate refused to take up the issue of direct election of senators, states pursued a convention, falling just short. Eventually, the 17th Amendment passed in the usual way, fulfilling that aim. In the 1960s, states sought a convention over a Supreme Court decision dictating how legislative districts were apportioned.\n\nBut convention opponents have always feared that once one has been launched, it could tear up the Constitutions in all sorts of ways.\n\nWhat\u2019s to stop a convention from passing an abhorrent affront to the Founders, like an outright ban on Muslims, asks constitutional law professor Michael Klarman of Harvard University. He points to a 2009 Swiss referendum that resulted in outlawing the construction of minarets, the towers found beside mosques.\n\nJones said such fears are \u201cmisguided\u201d and that \u201cso many stopgaps\u201d would prevent a \u201crunaway\u201d convention.\n\n___\n\nSedensky can be reached at msedensky@ap.org or https://twitter.com/sedensky", "This Sept. 19, 2018 photo shows U.S. Rep.

(AP) \u2014 South Carolina Democrats are gearing up again to try to stop a relentless Republican wave that has shown no sign of retreating.\n\nAll seven statewide offices are before voters Tuesday, and a Democrat hasn\u2019t won one since 2006. All seven U.S. House seats are up for grabs. The GOP controls six of them and the Democrats haven\u2019t wrestled a seat back since 1986.\n\nThe Democrats are spending a lot of money on two key races. State Rep. James Smith has spent $1.4 million in his bid to unseat Republican Gov. Henry McMaster, while Democrat Joe Cunningham has spent close to $2 million trying to defeat Republican state Rep. Katie Arrington for the 1st District U.S. House seat left open when Arrington knocked off incumbent Mark Sanford in the June primary.\n\nBut in other places on the ballot, Democrats hope to make gains against Republican incumbents who have had to fight off accusations of scandals or an unwillingness to work with lawmakers and others.\n\nOne thing is for certain: This election has energized voters. As of Friday, 230,000 people already cast ballots with two days of early voting to go. That\u2019s a 46 percent increase from 2014 early voting numbers, which set a midterm record, according to the South Carolina Election Commission.\n\nHere are races to watch:\n\n___\n\nSTATEWIDE OFFICES\n\nAlong with touting his accomplishments, South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson has spent campaign time this year explaining his role in an investigation into corruption at the Statehouse.\n\nLess than a month before the election, a State Grand Jury report said Wilson impeded an investigation into corruption at the South Carolina Statehouse involving a political consultant he hired and was a friend whether he meant to or not.\n\nDemocrat Constance Anastopoulo has spent nearly $500,000 of her own money trying to knock off Wilson, much of it on TV ads.

Melvin Whittenburg, who has emphasized he will make sure the job\u2019s requirements are met and also add new initiatives like waiving the application fee for new businesses started by someone who graduated college in the past two years.\n\nRepublican state Treasurer Curtis Loftis is running for a third term. He has tangled with legislators over investments and how to handle the state retirement system. His opponent is Democrat Rosalyn Glenn, a consultant who helps business and other groups with their financial strategies.\n\nSouth Carolina Agriculture Commissioner Hugh Weathers is seeking a fourth term against minor party candidates David Edmond of the Green Party and Chris Nelums of the United Citizens Party.\n\nSouth Carolina Education Superintendent Molly Spearman is running unopposed for second term after Democratic challenger Israel Romero dropped out of the race in October because an undisclosed felony conviction a decade ago made him ineligible to serve.\n\nRepublican Comptroller General Richard Eckstrom is guaranteed a fifth term.\n\n___\n\nCONGRESS\n\nThere is one rematch in the U.S. House races in South Carolina, as Democrat Archie Parnell takes on U.S. Rep.

(AP Photo/Alexander Zemlianichenko)\n\nMOSCOW (AP) \u2014 An Uzbek businessman who has been accused of ties to organized crime was elected president of the amateur boxing association on Saturday, putting the sport on a collision course with the International Olympic Committee.\n\nThe IOC criticized Gafur Rakhimov\u2019s bid to become head of AIBA, and it has yet to confirm boxing is on the program for the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo. The IOC has threatened to host an Olympic boxing tournament without AIBA, cutting off the financially troubled federation from a key funding source.\n\nRakhimov said AIBA can repair relations with the IOC, but didn\u2019t give details.\n\n\u201cWe can reach an agreement with the International Olympic Committee and if we somehow don\u2019t manage to agree then we will think of something so that boxing doesn\u2019t suffer,\u201d he said.\n\nRakhimov beat his only challenger, former Kazakh boxer and politician Serik Konakbayev, with 86 votes out of 134 valid ballots cast.\n\nRakhimov is on a U.S. Treasury Department sanctions list for alleged links to international heroin trafficking. The sanctions bar U.S. citizens and companies from doing business with him. He has denied wrongdoing.\n\nThe IOC said in a statement, \u201cThere are issues of grave concern with AIBA regarding judging, finance, and the anti-doping programme, and with governance,\u201d including Rakhimov\u2019s election as president.\n\nThe IOC added AIBA will be on the agenda at the next executive board meeting in Tokyo, starting on Nov. 30, and called for \u201ca clear roadmap for long-term sustainable reform of the federation.\u201d\n\nSpeaking before the vote, Rakhimov \u2014 who served as AIBA interim president since January \u2014 sought to play down tensions with the IOC.\n\n\u201cBoxing will definitely be on the Tokyo Olympic Games program, and also in Paris and Los Angeles (in 2024 and 2028), just like any future Olympic Games. It\u2019s in no way linked to your choice of AIBA president,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf any temporary issues arise between AIBA and the IOC, linked to the election of any AIBA official, including me, in that case we know how to solve them. Boxing and the Olympic Games are inseparable.\u201d\n\nRakhimov had suggested he could take an extended leave of absence from AIBA to help repair IOC relations, but a proposed rule change that would allow him to do that while retaining voting rights on AIBA\u2019s board was defeated twice at the congress.\n\nDelegates struggled with an electronic voting system which, in one test, produced more votes than the official delegate count, which had to be re-taken.\n\nOrganizers eventually resorted to hastily printed paper ballots and a makeshift voting booth made of tables and sheets.\n\nThe defeated candidate, Konakbayev, said he would form an opposition grouping.\n\n\u201cMy team is reviewing the decision as well as the election process,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not the end but the start of a movement to reform the world governing body and save boxing. We will not give up the fight. Round one is over, the bell for round two is chiming.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Treasury alleged in 2012 that Rakhimov was \u201cone of the leaders of Uzbek organized crime with a specialty in the organized production of drugs in the countries of Central Asia,\u201d and involved in trafficking heroin. He is preparing a legal challenge in the U.S. to his inclusion on the list.\n\nThe sanctions do not amount to a finding of guilt, and Rakhimov\u2019s legal team contends they stem from persecution by people connected to Uzbekistan\u2019s former president, Islam Karimov, who died in 2016.\n\nRakhimov is based in Dubai after previous legal issues in his native Uzbekistan, where he was at one stage featured on a wanted list, then removed.\n\nRakhimov was a boxer in his youth before moving into business and then sports politics. In 2007, he lobbied IOC members for Russia\u2019s bid to host the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi.\n\n\u201cI can say with real certainty that Sochi would have found it hard to count on victory\u201d without Rakhimov persuading voters from Asia, the then-president of the Russian Olympic Committee, Leonid Tyagachev, told the Rossiiskaya Gazeta newspaper at the time.\n\nAs interim president, Rakhimov said he\u2019d saved AIBA from bankruptcy. AIBA reported it was in negative equity of $19 million as of June, against less than $4 million in assets.\n\nRakhimov said on Friday he convinced AIBA\u2019s creditors to \u201cwaive\u201d much of its debt, but didn\u2019t say how.\n\nThe IOC has suspended payments to AIBA and did not let Rakhimov attend the Youth Olympics in Buenos Aires last month. British authorities previously blocked his accreditation request for the 2012 London Olympics.\n\nRakhimov also could not attend the 2000 Sydney Olympics when Australia\u2019s government denied him a visa despite being accredited for the games.\n\nAIBA was plunged into financial instability during the 11-year reign of former president C.K. Wu, who had ambitious plans to expand into professional boxing.\n\nWu was ousted last year and the AIBA executive board has sought to ban him for life over what it called \u201cgross negligence and financial mismanagement.\u201d\n\nWu has denied wrongdoing.\n\nBesides Rakhimov\u2019s leadership, the IOC has also objected to the frequent disputes over judging at the 2016 Olympics. That prompted a profane tirade from Irish fighter Michael Conlan, who accused AIBA and Russia of corruption after losing a quarterfinal to a Russian opponent.\n\nOn doping, AIBA executive director Tom Virgets said on Friday it resolved 38 long-running cases this year, but the verdicts were secret.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "CLEVELAND (AP) \u2014 Federal prosecutors say a Boy Scout leader recorded boys changing clothes before and after swimming at a YMCA, his home\u2019s bathroom and inside teepees at an Ohio scout reservation.\n\nThirty-nine-year-old Thomas Close, of Shelby in central Ohio\u2019s Richland County, was arrested and indicted Thursday on sexual exploitation of children and receiving and distributing child pornography charges.\n\nAn affidavit submitted by Homeland Security Investigations says cybercrime investigators focused on Close after linking him to videos found on the internet.

The party said in its statement that Rajapaksa\u2019s appointment and President Maithripala Sirisena\u2019s suspension of Parliament was undemocratic.\n\nIn the statement, the party accused Rajapaksa\u2019s government of offering money and ministerial posts to \u201cinduce\u201d opposition lawmakers to cross over. A Tamil National Alliance lawmaker, S.

(AP) \u2014 A look at where the two candidates for Pennsylvania governor \u2014 Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf and Republican nominee Scott Wagner \u2014 stand on some key issues, from abortion rights to taxes. Wolf is seeking a second 4-year term. Wagner, who runs a waste-hauling company, served four years in the state Senate before resigning in June. The election is Nov. 6.\n\n___\n\nABORTION RIGHTS\n\nWagner said he opposes abortion rights. He voted for legislation, vetoed by Wolf last year, to ban elective abortions after the first 20 weeks of pregnancy, compared with 24 weeks in current law. He also opposes state funding for Planned Parenthood and supports a \u201cheartbeat bill\u201d that would ban abortion after the detection of a fetal heartbeat, usually at around six weeks of pregnancy.\n\nWolf has opposed any effort to curtail abortion rights or cut off state funds from Planned Parenthood.\n\n___\n\nDEATH PENALTY\n\nWagner supports the death penalty. He said he will sign death warrants and will work to expand the application of the death penalty.\n\nAs governor, Wolf is granting reprieves \u2014 not commutations \u2014 when inmates are scheduled for execution, creating an effective moratorium on the death penalty. Wolf has said he has concerns about a \u201cflawed system that has been proven to be an endless cycle of court proceedings as well as ineffective, unjust, and expensive.\u201d He believes the moratorium should continue until the Legislature addresses problems identified in a June report by the Joint State Government Commission.\n\n___\n\nGUN VIOLENCE\n\nWagner opposes more restrictions on gun ownership or gun sales. He also opposes an expansion of background checks on gun purchases.\n\nWolf supports a ban on the sale of assault weapons and bump stocks and an expansion of background checks to cover private sales of shotguns, sporting rifles and semi-automatic rifles.\n\nWagner voted for legislation to force people with a domestic violence conviction or restraining order against them to more quickly forfeit their firearms, and Wolf signed it earlier this month.\n\n___\n\nLABOR UNIONS\n\nWagner supports legislation to prohibit all labor unions from collecting dues from employees who refuse to join the union or pay union dues or fees as a condition of employment. Wolf opposes the legislation.\n\n___\n\nMEDICAID\n\nWagner said he will keep Pennsylvania\u2019s 4-year-old expansion of Medicaid\u2019s income guidelines, but he said he would seek a federal waiver to institute a work requirement for able-bodied adults, and possibly seek other changes.\n\nWolf supports Medicaid\u2019s expansion and last year vetoed legislation to impose work or job search requirements. A federal judge has blocked Kentucky from enforcing a Medicaid work requirement, and a similar court challenge over Arkansas\u2019 requirement is pending.\n\n___\n\nMINIMUM WAGE\n\nWagner said he would support raising it to around $9.50 or $9.75 an hour, up from the current federal minimum of $7.25. His campaign said he wants to make the change in steps, similar to the way legislation he backed in the Senate would have raised the minimum wage to $8.75 an hour in three 50-cent increments over three years. Wolf last year proposed raising the minimum wage to $12 an hour immediately, and tying future increases to inflation.\n\n___\n\nPENSIONS\n\nWagner supports a move to a full 401(k)-style benefit for Pennsylvania\u2019s two major public employee pension systems; in 2015, he voted for legislation to combine a 401(k)-style defined-contribution plan and a \u201ccash-balance\u201d plan that, it was estimated, would have reduced pension debt payments by $11 billion over about 30 years.\n\nWolf vetoed that bill, saying it would have unfairly forced newly hired state government and public school employees to help pay down the cost of existing pensions. Wolf last year signed a hybrid pension law that is projected to have very little effect on debt payments over the next three decades.\n\n___\n\nPROPERTY TAXES\n\nWagner supports the elimination of school property taxes, under legislation that theoretically would make up for more than $13 billion in disappearing school property tax revenue by raising the rates of Pennsylvania\u2019s personal income tax and state sales tax, and expanding the base of the sales tax.\n\nWolf said he stands by a $3.2 billion plan he floated in 2015, his first year as governor, to be financed by increases in personal income and state sales taxes. Under Wolf\u2019s plan, most of the money \u2014 just over $2 billion \u2014 would go to districts in the bottom half of average income. The plan is part of Wolf\u2019s goal of raising the state\u2019s share of education funding to 50 percent, up from nearly 38 percent in 2016-17, according to the latest federal data. That proposal went nowhere in the Republican-controlled Legislature.\n\n___\n\nPUBLIC SCHOOLS\n\nWagner supports legislation to create taxpayer-funded \u201ceducation savings accounts\u201d that divert state aid for public schools into accounts that parents can use for tuition at private or parochial schools. Wolf opposes the bill.\n\nWagner said in March he was not inclined to devote more money to public schools, but later said he would support a $1 billion injection of cash into public schools in his first year as governor. He said he can find the necessary cash by privatizing the sale of wine and alcohol in Pennsylvania, ending ineffective tax credits and finding unspecified efficiencies in state government.\n\nWolf said he will continue to push for more funding for public schools to ensure every student gets a good education, although he has not outlined specific amounts. In his first term, lawmakers approved an additional $1 billion in education aid, about half of what Wolf had originally sought over the four years.\n\n___\n\nREDISTRICTING\n\nWolf supports the creation of a new commission to draw congressional and legislative district boundaries. Wagner supports the current system in which state lawmakers draw legislative and congressional districts.\n\n___\n\nTAXES AND BUDGETING\n\nWagner said he can reduce the cost of state government \u2014 whose operating budget is $32.7 billion \u2014 by $1.5 billion to $4 billion, although he hasn\u2019t said how. Wagner said he opposes tax increases, including on the Marcellus Shale natural gas industry.\n\nWolf said he does not envision needing a budget-balancing tax increase in a second term but will continue to pursue a severance tax on Marcellus Shale natural gas production. The Legislature has blocked that tax and the majority of the billions of dollars in other tax increases Wolf had sought to wipe out a persistent deficit and boost public school aid.\n\nBoth Wagner and Wolf want to cut Pennsylvania\u2019s 9.99 percent corporate net income tax rate. Wagner said he wants to lower it to the same rate as Pennsylvania\u2019s personal income tax, 3.07 percent.\n\nWolf last year proposed lowering the rate in steps to 6.49 percent in 2022, and also restructuring how it is applied to stop businesses based in other states from avoiding the tax on their Pennsylvania operations. Republican lawmakers blocked the proposal.\n\n___\n\nTAX RETURNS\n\nWagner has declined to release his tax return. Wolf made his two-page 1040 form public and allowed The Associated Press to review the rest of his 102-page federal tax return.\n\n___\n\nFollow Marc Levy on Twitter at www.twitter.com/timelywriter.", "This photo made available by the U.S. National Archives shows a portion of the United States Constitution with the title of Article V. For the past two centuries, constitutional amendments have originated in Congress, where they need the support of two-thirds of both houses, and then the approval of at least three-quarters of the states. But under a never-used second prong of Article V, amendments can originate in the states. (National Archives via AP)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Whatever success Republicans have amassed in taking control of all three branches of U.S. government, and whatever fate awaits them as midterm elections near, some on the right are working to cement change by amending the Constitution. And to the mounting alarm of others on all parts of the spectrum, they want to bypass the usual process.\n\nThey\u2019re pushing for an unprecedented Constitutional convention of the states. While opponents are afraid of what such a convention would do, supporters say it is the only way to deal with the federal government\u2019s overreach and ineptitude.\n\n\u201cThey literally see this as the survival of the nation,\u201d said Karla Jones, director of the federalism task force at the conservative American Legislative Exchange Council, which represents state lawmakers and offers guidance and model legislation for states to call a convention under the Constitution\u2019s Article V.\n\nAmong the most frequently cited changes being sought: amendments enforcing a balanced federal budget, establishing term limits for members of Congress, and repealing the 17th Amendment, which put the power of electing the Senate in the hands of the public instead of state legislatures.\n\nFor the past 229 years, constitutional amendments have originated in Congress, where they need the support of two-thirds of both houses, and then the approval of at least three-quarters of the states.\n\nBut under a never-used second prong of Article V, amendments can originate in the states. Two-thirds of states \u2014 currently, 34 \u2014 must call for a convention at which three-fourths of states approve of a change.\n\nThe particulars of such a convention, though, are not laid out. Do the states have to call for a convention on the same topic? Must they pass resolutions with similar or identical wording? The U.S. Supreme Court may have to decide whether the threshold of states has been reached and, ultimately, the parameters of a convention and the rules delegates would be governed by.\n\nA bill introduced in the U.S. House last year would direct the National Archives to compile all applications for an Article V convention.\n\nSome believe enough states have already passed Article V resolutions, pointing to votes over the years across the country on a variety of potential amendment topics. Others contend the highest possible current count of states is 28 \u2014 the number of states with existing resolutions on the most common convention topic, a balanced budget amendment. Others point to lower total counts based on states that have passed near-identical resolutions.\n\nRegardless, proponents of a convention believe they have momentum on their side more than any other time in American history.\n\n\u201cThat second clause of Article V was specifically intended for a time like this, when the federal government gets out of control and when the Congress won\u2019t deliver to the people what they want,\u201d said Mark Meckler, a tea party leader who now heads Citizens for Self-Governance, which runs the Convention of States Project calling for an Article V convention. Legislation promoted by the group calls for a convention focused on the federal government\u2019s budget and power, and term limits for office holders. It has passed 12 states and one legislative chamber in another 10.\n\nThe Convention of States Project says 18 other states are considering the measure.\n\nMeckler, like other backers of a convention, believes there\u2019s no reason why it can\u2019t be limited in scope. Others aren\u2019t so sure. Four states that previously had passed resolutions calling for a convention have rescinded them in recent years, often citing wariness over a \u201crunaway\u201d convention.\n\nKaren Hobert Flynn, president of Common Cause, has sounded alarms on a possible convention and portrays the coast-to-coast emergence of resolutions on the issue \u201ca game of Whack-a-Mole.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the most dangerous idea in American politics that most people know nothing about,\u201d she said.\n\nNancy MacLean, a Duke University historian and author of \u201cDemocracy in Chains: The Deep History of the Radical Right\u2019s Stealth Plan for America,\u201d views the prospect of an Article V convention with fear \u2014 the next chapter of decades of work on the far right transforming the federal judiciary and supporting cases that go on to make broad constitutional points, all while suppressing votes and gerrymandering districts.\n\n\u201cThe ultimate project,\u201d MacLean said of conservatives, \u201cis to transform our primary rules book, which is the Constitution.\u201d\n\nThere are proponents of an Article V convention on the left who see it as a possible way to overturn the Citizens United campaign finance decision, pass the Equal Rights Amendment and otherwise address what they see as a stacked deck that has helped the GOP get an unfair advantage. But with more red states than blue ones, it seems an unlikely path to abolishing the Electoral College, reengineering apportionment of the Senate or otherwise devising a democracy they believe is more reflective of the American public\u2019s views.\n\nIn that view, it\u2019s baffling to some observers that conservatives are the ones pushing a convention.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what exactly they\u2019re unhappy with. When I look at the current politics, it seems to me things for them are going really well,\u201d said constitutional law professor Michael Klarman of Harvard University. \u201cThey\u2019re already getting what they want from the Supreme Court. Gerrymandering is fine. Unlimited money in politics is fine. The Electoral College is OK. Voter purges, photo ID laws are OK. So I don\u2019t know exactly what they\u2019re looking for.\u201d\n\nMeckler acknowledges the loudest voices calling for a convention are conservative. (\u201cYou look at our website, it\u2019s all right-wingers,\u201d he says.) But he sees that as a reflection of a conservative culture in which the Constitution is more frequently discussed, not a reflection of the politics of it.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time a convention has been proposed.\n\nIn the 1890s, when the Senate refused to take up the issue of direct election of senators, states pursued a convention, falling just short. Eventually, the 17th Amendment passed in the usual way, fulfilling that aim. In the 1960s, states sought a convention over a Supreme Court decision dictating how legislative districts were apportioned.\n\nBut convention opponents have always feared that once one has been launched, it could tear up the Constitutions in all sorts of ways.\n\nWhat\u2019s to stop a convention from passing an abhorrent affront to the Founders, like an outright ban on Muslims, Klarman asks. He points to a 2009 Swiss referendum that resulted in outlawing the construction of minarets, the towers found beside mosques.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a dangerous route and an unpredictable one,\u201d said Laurence Tribe, another Harvard University constitutional law expert.\n\nJones said such fears are \u201cmisguided\u201d and that \u201cso many stopgaps\u201d would prevent a \u201crunaway\u201d convention.\n\n\u201cThat suggests a failure of institutions that is so massive that the last thing we need to worry about is a constitutional amendment,\u201d she said. \u201cThat would suggest that Congress failed in its duty to say, \u2018Look, you dealt with an issue that is not contained in the resolution.\u2019 That would require the judiciary to also not step in. It would require a failure of all of our democratic institutions and it would require a failure of the American people not to rise up.\u201d\n\nStill, several states have rescinded previous calls for a convention as lawmakers grew fearful of what it could bring.\n\nOver the years, Nevada lawmakers have made various calls for a convention to consider a ban on abortion, to prohibit racial integration of schools and to abolish the 17th Amendment.\n\nBut when Democratic state Sen. Tick Segerblom saw how close advocates were to hitting the 34-state mark, he realized the idea was no longer far-fetched and that it would be safer to back off its Article V votes rather than take the chance of a runaway convention. So last year, he sponsored a resolution to do just that.\n\nThe goals of convention backers \u201care not the Democratic Party\u2019s goals or even the Republican Party\u2019s goals,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s some fringe groups.\u201d\n\nIn fact, while some conservatives have voiced the greatest support for a convention, others strongly oppose it.\n\nAt an October hearing in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, Kim Stolfer of the gun rights group Firearms Owners Against Crime told lawmakers that the push for a convention \u201cscares the dickens out of me.\u201d Andy Schafly of the conservative Pennsylvania Eagle Forum called a convention \u201ca Pandora\u2019s box.\u201d\n\nA Republican who sponsored an Article V resolution and supports it so passionately that she calls it \u201cmy baby,\u201d Arizona state Rep. Kelly Townsend once shared those misgivings.\n\nNow, though, she believes it could both put the country on the right path and unite the parties. She thinks an amendment on term limits could bring Democrats and Republicans together. That, in turn, could lead to another amendment that merges issues of opposing sides \u2014 perhaps, say, overturning of Citizens United to appeal to liberals while mandating a balanced budget to bring in conservatives.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t red vs. blue,\u201d she said, \u201cthis is about states\u2019 rights and an overspending, overbearing federal government that is out of control.\u201d\n\nHarvard\u2019s Tribe rejects that as naive.\n\n\u201cThe idea that we could have a kumbaya moment in which a convention would produce a stable republic with some respect for the rule of law,\u201d he said, \u201cseems like a fantasy.\u201d\n\n___\n\nSedensky can be reached at msedensky@ap.org or https://twitter.com/sedensky", "Central American migrants, part of the caravan hoping to reach the U.S. border, get a ride on a truck in Donaji, Oaxaca state, Mexico, Friday, Nov. 2, 2018.

That\u2019s below a 2000 peak of $42,348 and also statistically no better than 2016, President Barack Obama\u2019s last year in office.\n\nMany economists view the continued economic growth since the middle of 2009, in Obama\u2019s first term, as the primary explanation for recent hiring and income gains. More important, there are multiple signs that the racial wealth gap is now worsening even as unemployment rates have come down.\n\nAs to Asian-Americans, the median income for a typical household last year was $81,331. It was $83,182 in 2016.\n\n___\n\nILLEGAL IMMIGRATION\n\nTRUMP, on the practice of allowing immigrants caught crossing the border illegally to stay in U.S. communities as they await immigration hearings: \u201cWe\u2019re not doing releases. What\u2019s been happening over years is they would come in, release them, and they would never show up for their trial. And we now have 25 or 30 million people in this country illegally, because of what\u2019s been happening over many years.\u201d \u2014 remarks Wednesday to reporters.\n\nTHE FACTS: It\u2019s nowhere close to 25 million to 30 million, nor has the number increased much in recent years.\n\nThe nonpartisan Pew Research Center estimates there were 11.3 million immigrants in the U.S. illegally in 2016, the most recent data available. That number is basically unchanged from 2009. Advocacy groups on both sides of the immigration issue have similar estimates.\n\nThe number of such immigrants had reached a height of 12.2 million in 2007, representing about 4 percent of the U.S. population, before declining due in part to a weakening U.S. economy.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP, on tweeting a video blaming Democrats allowing a man to enter the U.S. who killed two police officers: \u201cAll I\u2019m doing is just telling the truth.\u201d \u2014 speaking to reporters Friday.\n\nTHE FACTS: The video he spread around does not tell the truth. It says Democrats let Luis Bracamontes into the country and \u201clet him stay.\u201d\n\nBracamontes entered the U.S. illegally, in 1996, during the Democratic administration of President Bill Clinton, but he was also deported by that administration the next year after being caught buying crack cocaine and serving his sentence. He returned repeatedly. By the time he was sentenced to death in California for the 2014 killings of the police officers, he had been deported four times, according to Sacramento County Sheriff Scott Jones.\n\nNo evidence of leniency by Democrats has emerged in the episode. Democratic and Republican administrations alike have deported hundreds of thousands of people a year and no administration, Trump\u2019s included, has caught everyone trying to enter illegally.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP on what U.S. troops should do if encountering migrants who are trying to get to the border from Mexico: \u201cI didn\u2019t say shoot, I didn\u2019t say shoot.\u201d \u2014 remarks to reporters Friday.\n\nTHE FACTS: A day earlier, he said of the migrants: \u201cThey want to throw rocks at our military, our military fights back. I told them, consider it a rifle.\u201d\n\nThe procession has been largely peaceful. Some migrants in one caravan clashed with Mexican police at the Mexico-Guatemala border, hurling stones.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP: \u201cPresident Obama separated the children from parents and nobody complained. When we continued the exact same law, the country went crazy.\u201d \u2014 immigration speech Thursday.\n\nTHE FACTS: Actually, Obama did not do the same thing as a matter of policy.\n\nWhile it\u2019s true the underlying laws were the same, the Trump administration mandated anyone caught crossing the border illegally was to be criminally prosecuted. That policy meant adults were taken to court for criminal proceedings, and their children were separated and sent into the care of the Health and Human Services Department, which is tasked with caring for unaccompanied migrant children. Trump\u2019s zero tolerance policy remains in effect, but he signed an executive order June 20 that stopped separations.\n\nJeh Johnson, Obama\u2019s Homeland Security secretary, recently told NPR there may have been unusual or emergency circumstances when children were taken from parents, but there was no such policy.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP: \u201cAt this very moment, large well-organized caravans of migrants are marching towards our southern border. Some people call it an invasion. ...These are tough people in many cases; a lot of young men, strong men and a lot of men that maybe we don\u2019t want in our country. ...This isn\u2019t an innocent group of people. It\u2019s a large number of people that are tough. They have injured, they have attacked.\u201d \u2014 immigration speech Thursday.\n\nTHE FACTS: He\u2019s given no evidence that people in the caravans are, by and large, dangerous, hardened criminals \u2014 after acknowledging at one point that there is no such proof.\n\nThe migrants in the caravans are mostly from Honduras, where it started, as well as El Salvador and Guatemala. Overall, they are poor, carrying the belongings that fit into a knapsack and fleeing gang violence or poverty.\n\nIt might be true there are some criminals mixed in with the throngs, given the sheer number of migrants. Trump did not substantiate his claim that members of the MS-13 gang, in particular, are among them. The Homeland Security Department issued a sheet stating that \u201cover 270 individuals along the caravan route have criminal histories, including known gang membership.\u201d But it did not specify how it had arrived at that number.\n\nSome migrants in one of the caravans clashed with Mexican police at the Mexico-Guatemala border, hurling stones and other objects as they tried to cross the international bridge. One migrant died; it\u2019s not clear how it happened. Caravan leaders said they had expelled a number of troublemakers from the procession, exhibiting some self-policing. Ultimately, most entered Guatemala \u2014 and later, Mexico \u2014 by illegally bypassing immigration checkpoints.\n\nThe caravan otherwise has been overwhelmingly peaceful, receiving applause and donated food from residents of the towns they pass. Mexican police have not tried again to stop them.\n\n___\n\nBIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP\n\nTRUMP: \u201cIt was always told to me that you needed a constitutional amendment. Guess what? You don\u2019t. ... Well, you can definitely do it with an act of Congress. But now they\u2019re saying I can do it just with an executive order.\u201d \u2014 interview published Tuesday with \u201cAxios on HBO.\u201d\n\nTHE FACTS: Scholars widely pan the idea that Trump could unilaterally change the rules on who is a citizen. It\u2019s highly questionable whether an act of Congress could do it, either, though it is conceivable that legislators could change the rules regarding children born in the U.S. of parents who are in the country illegally.\n\nPeter Schuck is perhaps the most prominent advocate of the idea that birthright citizenship is not conveyed by the Constitution to children of parents who are living illegally in the U.S. Even he says \u201cTrump clearly cannot act by\u201d executive order.\n\n\u201cI feel confident that no competent lawyer would advise him otherwise,\u201d he said by email Tuesday. \u201cThis is just pre-election politics and misrepresentation and should be sharply criticized as such.\u201d\n\nSchuck, of Yale, and colleague Rogers Smith of the University of Pennsylvania have argued since the mid-1980s that Congress can set the rules for providing citizenship to U.S.-born children of parents who came illegally.\n\nBut most scholars on the left and right share the view that it would take a constitutional amendment to deny automatic citizenship to children born in the U.S. to parents who are in the country illegally.\n\nJames Ho, a conservative Trump-appointed federal appeals court judge, wrote in the Green Bag legal journal in 2006 that birthright citizenship \u201cis protected no less for children of undocumented persons than for descendants of Mayflower passengers.\u201d\n\nStephen Yale-Loehr, a Cornell university immigration expert, said the case against Trump\u2019s authority is \u201cnot open and shut, but the better view is it would require a constitutional amendment.\u201d\n\nThe Constitution\u2019s citizenship clause was part of the post-Civil War amendments that enshrined the rights of African-Americans. The citizenship clause, in particular, was intended to overturn the Supreme Court\u2019s notorious Dred Scott decision of 1857 that held African-Americans were not citizens.\n\nThe Supreme Court has never ruled squarely about the clause\u2019s application to children of immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally. Trump did not make a distinction between legal and illegal status in his remarks. An 1898 Supreme Court decision held that the U.S.-born son of legal Chinese immigrants was a citizen under the 14th Amendment; a footnote in a 1982 decision suggests there should be no difference for children of foreign-born parents whether they are in the U.S. legally or illegally.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP: \u201cWe\u2019re the only country in the world where a person comes in, has a baby and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United States for 85 years with all of those benefits. It\u2019s ridiculous. It\u2019s ridiculous. And it has to end.\u201d \u2014 interview with \u201cAxios on HBO.\u201d\n\nTHE FACTS: That\u2019s wrong.\n\nThe U.S. is among about 30 countries where birthright citizenship \u2014 the principle of jus soli or \u201cright of the soil\u201d \u2014 is applied, according to the World Atlas and other sources. Most are in the Americas. Canada and Mexico are among them. Most other countries confer citizenship based on that of at least one parent \u2014 jus sanguinis, or \u201cright of blood\u201d \u2014 or have a modified form of birthright citizenship that may restrict automatic citizenship to children of parents who are on their territory legally.\n\nMore broadly, Trump\u2019s view that U.S.-born children of foreigners live a lifetime of taking \u201call those benefits\u201d ignores the taxes they pay, the work they do and their other contributions to society.\n\n___\n\n2016 ELECTION\n\nSARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, White House press secretary: Trump \u201cgot elected by an overwhelming majority of 63 million Americans who came out and supported him and wanted to see his policies enacted.\u201d \u2014 press briefing Monday.\n\nTHE FACTS: Trump did not earn a majority of votes in the 2016 election. He did win the Electoral College, allowing him to capture the presidency.\n\nTrump won nearly 63 million votes compared with more than 65 million for Democrat Hillary Clinton, who racked up lopsided victories in big states such as New York and California, according to election data compiled by The Associated Press. But she lost the presidency due to Trump\u2019s winning margin in the Electoral College, which came after he narrowly won less populous Midwestern states including Michigan and Wisconsin.\n\n___\n\nFLORIDA GOVERNOR\u2019S RACE\n\nTRUMP, on Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum: \u201cHis city, Tallahassee, is known as the most corrupt in Florida and one of the most corrupt in the nation.\u201d \u2014 Fox interview Monday.\n\nTHE FACTS: Trump is making an unsubstantiated assertion. Republicans including Gillum\u2019s opponent, Ron DeSantis, have made crime and corruption a talking point in the governor\u2019s race to knock down the Tallahassee mayor\u2019s political momentum, saying it\u2019s a crime-ridden city. But Tallahassee is not even in the top 25 when it comes to city per-capita crime rates in Florida. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement reports that Tallahassee had 5,765 crimes per 100,000 people in 2017. By comparison, the Florida city with the highest rate, Medley, had 28,004 crimes per 100,000 people.\n\nTrump, who stressed the principle of innocent until proven guilty when allegations shadowed Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, has also pointed to an ongoing investigation by the state\u2019s ethics commission into whether Gillum accepted gifts from lobbyists after a Tallahassee businessman and persistent critic of Gillum filed a complaint. Gillum has denied any wrongdoing in that case, or that he is a target in a separate ongoing FBI investigation into the city\u2019s government.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Colleen Long and Mark Sherman in Washington and Elliot Spagat in San Diego contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFind AP Fact Checks at http://apne.ws/2kbx8bd\n\nFollow @APFactCheck on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APFactCheck", "DETROIT (AP) \u2014 Newly expanded galleries dedicated to Asian art are opening at the Detroit Institute of Arts .\n\nThe galleries in the museum\u2019s Robert and Katherine Jacobs Asian Wing make their public debut Sunday.

(AP) \u2014 Nine months after 17 classmates and teachers were gunned down at their Florida school, Parkland students are finally facing the moment they\u2019ve been leading up to with marches, school walkouts and voter-registration events throughout the country: their first Election Day.\n\nThe Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School student activists set their sights on the 4 million U.S. citizens turning 18 this year. They\u2019re hoping to counteract the voter apathy that\u2019s especially prevalent among the youth during midterm elections. Many of the activists, now household names like David Hogg, postponed college plans to mobilize young voters. Many of them support gun reform, in the name of their fallen classmates.\n\n\u201cIt is kind of the culmination of everything we\u2019ve been working for,\u201d said senior Jaclyn Corin, one of the founders of the March For Our Lives group. \u201cThis is truly the moment that young people are going to make the difference in this country.\u201d\n\nCorin, who voted along with her dad at an early polling site on her 18th birthday, visited a half-dozen cities in just a handful of days last week, getting up at 3 a.m. to board planes.\n\nParkland students arrived at University Central Florida as part of Vote for Our Lives tour with an aim to mobilize the students to vote. (Nov. 2)\n\nIt has been a whirlwind for the students, with celebrity support from Oprah to Kim Kardashian, a Time magazine cover, late night TV spots and book deals \u2014 but all of it misses their main target unless it motivates students to cast ballots by the end of Tuesday.\n\nAt a University of Central Florida event during the final week of election campaigning, Stoneman Douglas graduate and current UCF student Bradley Thornton escorted fellow students to the campus\u2019 early voting site. UCF student Tiffany McKelton said she wouldn\u2019t have voted if the Parkland activists hadn\u2019t shown up on campus.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never voted in a primary election. I actually did it because of them,\u201d said McKelton, a psychology major from West Palm Beach.\n\nIn the past months they\u2019ve boarded countless buses and planes, passed out T shirts, and hosted BBQs and dance parties on college campuses around the U.S.\n\nThornton said talking things through often does the trick.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how many conversations I\u2019ve had that were like, \u2018Ah, I\u2019m not interested\u2019 ... and through just a simple, really nice cordial conversation, they get this magical inspiration to vote,\u201d Thornton said.\n\nCorin said she\u2019s encountered plenty of voter apathy along the way. The students often note that voter turnout in the last midterm elections was the lowest since World War II.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really about tying it back to gun violence or tying it back to immigration or whatever that person is passionate about,\u201d Corin said. \u201cI\u2019ve used that tactic so many times and it has actually worked.\u201d\n\nIt remains to be seen what role the youth vote will play in this year\u2019s midterms.\n\nThe 30-and-under crowd is more likely to vote in this year\u2019s midterms than in the past. Forty percent say they\u2019ll vote, compared to just 26 percent in 2014, according to a new poll by Institute of Politics at Harvard University\u2019s Kennedy School of Government. They\u2019re being pushed, in part, by a strong disapproval of President Donald Trump.\n\nTrends in Florida\u2019s early voting suggest a surge in young voters.\n\nOf the 124,000 people aged 18 to 29 who had voted in person at early polling stations as of Thursday, nearly a third did not vote in the presidential election in 2016, according to analysis by University of Florida political science professor Daniel Smith. About half of those new voters were newly registered.\n\n\u201cThere are newly energized voters who sat out in 2016, or have registered since then, who are turning out. There\u2019s no question about that,\u201d Smith said.\n\nIn contrast, for people 65 and older who had voted early and in person, about 7 percent didn\u2019t vote in 2016.\n\nMatt Deitsch dropped out of college after the Feb. 14 shooting at Stoneman Douglas to help start March For Our Lives alongside his younger siblings, Parkland survivors Ryan Deitsch and Samantha Deitsch.\n\nHe said this year\u2019s election will be a starting point, \u201cnot a culmination.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s where we really get to see what kind of push we really made to the needle,\u201d Deitsch said in between passing out fliers to UCF students. \u201cWe\u2019re running a really good race but there\u2019s really so much work to do.\u201d\n\nCorin said the young activists will continue with their mission regardless of the election outcome.\n\n\u201cThe fact that we\u2019ve engaged a new generation of voters, that\u2019s a win,\u201d Corin said.\n\n____\n\nSchneider reported from Orlando.\n\n____\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "Historic fort to be rebuilt at Illinois\u2019 oldest state park\n\nMETROPOLIS, Ill.

(AP Photo/Melinda Deslatte, File)\n\nBATON ROUGE, La. (AP) \u2014 The only statewide position up for grabs on Louisiana\u2019s ballot Tuesday stems from scandal, a competitive special election for secretary of state caused by sexual harassment allegations.\n\nThough the opening of the seat was high-profile, candidates to be the state\u2019s next elections chief have struggled to draw interest from voters or donors, as Louisiana\u2019s primary election lacks the drama or national attention focused on other states.\n\nBeyond filling the secretary of state\u2019s job, Louisiana voters will decide whether to return six U.S. House incumbents to Washington for another term and whether to rewrite six provisions in the state constitution. One constitutional amendment has attracted intense support across the political spectrum, to require unanimous jury verdicts for all felony convictions.\n\nRunoff elections, as needed, will be Dec. 8.\n\nSECRETARY OF STATE\n\nThe competition to be Louisiana\u2019s next secretary of state is jam-packed, with nine candidates jockeying to complete the remaining year of the term of Republican Tom Schedler, who resigned in May amid allegations he sexually harassed an employee.\n\nLouisiana\u2019s secretary of state oversees elections, state archives and business registrations.\n\nSchedler\u2019s top aide, Republican Kyle Ardoin of Baton Rouge, is working in the interim position. While he repeatedly said he wouldn\u2019t run, Ardoin announced in the final minutes of the candidate sign-up period that he changed his mind and would be on the ballot.\n\nOther Republicans seeking the position include Turkey Creek Mayor Heather Cloud, former state Sen. A.G. Crowe of Pearl River, state Rep. Rick Edmonds of Baton Rouge, and state Rep. Julie Stokes of Kenner. Democrats in the race include Gwen Collins-Greenup, a lawyer and notary from Clinton, and Renee Fontenot Free, a former first assistant to two prior secretaries of state who most recently worked for the attorney general.\n\nOnly a few contenders have raised enough money \u2014 or loaned their campaigns enough cash \u2014 to reach out to voters via TV and radio. Many of the candidates have focused on low-expense efforts, traveling the state to speak at small forums, luncheons, parades and other events.\n\nU.S. HOUSE SEATS\n\nAll six of Louisiana\u2019s incumbent congressmen have drawn opponents: Republicans Steve Scalise in the 1st District, Clay Higgins in the 3rd District, Mike Johnson in the 4th District, Ralph Abraham in the 5th District, and Garret Graves in the 6th District and Democrat Cedric Richmond in the 2nd District.\n\nMany of their opponents, however, significantly lag in the financing to mount the sort of advertising and outreach effort often needed to oust a sitting member of Congress.\n\nIf Scalise and Richmond win re-election as expected, both men are positioned for continued high-profile leadership roles, depending on which party controls the House in the upcoming term. Scalise is the House\u2019s third-ranking Republican and is expected to advance higher if Republicans control the House. Richmond is chairman of the influential Congressional Black Caucus and could move into an even more prominent position if Democrats take the House.\n\nIn his first term in office, Higgins drew the most challengers, with six contenders trying to oust him from the district representing southwest and south central Louisiana. He\u2019s also the only Louisiana congressman to face an intra-party fight.\n\nCONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS\n\nThere are six proposals to change the Louisiana Constitution.\n\nAmendment 1 would make convicted state felons wait five years after serving their sentences before they can run for office in Louisiana, unless they are pardoned.\n\nAmendment 2 would end a Jim Crow-era law that allows split juries to convict people of serious felony crimes. Louisiana is one of two states that permit non-unanimous verdicts in felony cases. The proposal would require all felony jury verdicts to be unanimous to convict.\n\nAmendment 3 would authorize local government agencies to share equipment and staff for a specific activity if they have a written agreement, without any compensation needing to be exchanged.\n\nAmendment 4 would prohibit use of money from Louisiana\u2019s Transportation Trust Fund, which contains state gasoline and fuel tax income, to pay for state police operations. Instead, the money could only be spent on road, bridge, port and airport work.\n\nAmendment 5 would extend Louisiana\u2019s special property tax assessments for the elderly, disabled veterans and surviving spouses of people in the military, law enforcement, firefighters and emergency medical technicians who die in the line of duty to homes placed in a trust.\n\nAmendment 6 would require a four-year phase-in of higher property taxes when a tax assessor\u2019s reappraisal boosts a home\u2019s value by more than 50 percent. The change wouldn\u2019t apply if the home is sold or its value was bumped up by construction or upgrades.\n\nFANTASY SPORTS\n\nVoters will decide on a parish-by-parish basis whether to legalize cash-league fantasy sports contests through online sites such as DraftKings and FanDuel.\n\nWith fantasy sports websites, people can create imaginary teams of real-life sports players and score points based on how those players perform in actual games. The sites charge an entry fee and offer payouts to winners.\n\nLouisiana is one of nine states that don\u2019t allow online fantasy sports betting. Though the games only will be permitted in parishes where voters authorize it, anybody will be able to log into the fantasy sports sites if they travel to those parishes.\n\n___\n\nFollow Melinda Deslatte on Twitter at http://twitter.com/melindadeslatte\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "FILE - This file picture taken Tuesday, Feb. 14, 2017, shows an overview of the informal Rukban camp, between the Jordan and Syria borders.

(AP) \u2014 The crime continues as the killer, locked away in state prison, holds the secret that twists like a knife in the soul of a grandmother agonizing over the missing bodies of her daughter and two grandchildren.\n\nLuis Toledo is less than a year into his three consecutive life prison sentences on the fifth anniversary Tuesday of the day he killed his wife, Yessenia Suarez, 28, and her two children, Thalia Otto, 9, and Michael Elijah Otto, 8, in their home at 317 Covent Gardens Lane.\n\nThe killings and the disposal of the bodies were done in the darkness of the early morning of Oct. 23, 2013.\n\nAnd despite one of the biggest local law enforcement searches ever, covering about 90 square miles across Volusia and Seminole counties and including the help of out-of-state volunteers, the bodies of the mother and children have not been found.\n\nToledo, now 36, vowed never to reveal what he did with the bodies.\n\nThe children\u2019s grandmother, Felicita Nieves Perez, 54, vows never to stop looking.\n\n\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for God, you know, honestly speaking, if it wasn\u2019t for God I would not be making it through this long,\u201d Nieves Perez said, stopping to hold back tears during a recent interview. \u201cI still have hope that one day God will guide somebody to where they are or Luis will speak up. Once he repents for what he did he might decide to tell us where they are at.\u201d\n\nNievez Perez is marking the anniversary of her family\u2019s murder and disappearance with a gathering next to a park-and-ride lot across from the McDonald\u2019s at 410 Deltona Blvd. It is near Exit 108 of Interstate 4. She picked the spot because there is a lot of traffic there. She calls it a gathering of \u201cawareness\u201d in hopes of making people aware of cases in which loved ones remain missing.\n\nBut Nieves Perez says finding them won\u2019t make the pain go away.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to say once they are found there\u2019s going to be closure,\u201d she said. \u201cMy life totally changed five years ago. It will never, never be the same.\u201d\n\nBut she carries on with the memories. She keeps large pictures of her daughter and her two grandchildren on the wall of her home in Volusia County. She moved from her previous home but does not want the city where she lives published because she fears for her safety.\n\n\u201cAs far as me, I keep going day by day. Every day when I wake up it is another day. I\u2019m hoping that my family will be found, \u201d she said. \u201cI still cry every day.\u201d\n\nAn unlikely couple\n\nThat matrimony would follow the meeting between Toledo and Suarez at a 2009 street festival in Orange County seemed unlikely. But Toledo made himself out to be a protector. He moved in with her three months later and they married on New Year\u2019s Day in 2011.\n\nSuarez was goal oriented and career minded, a working mother with two young children. Toledo was a convict who served time in state prison under an alias.\n\nAt one point he was a violent state leader of the Latin Kings street gang.\n\nToledo once held a man down while another gang member used a hot pan to burn off the victim\u2019s gang tattoo. Toledo was interested in mixed-martial arts. His nickname was \u201cSemi\u201d because he punched like a truck.\n\nOn Oct. 23, 2013, Suarez was just months away from a bachelor\u2019s degree in psychology from Rollins College. She was a high-achieving student. Her degree would have been awarded magna cum laude.\n\nSuarez also worked at American K9 in Lake Mary, a company that provides dogs to the military and police.\n\nToledo remained home and became responsible for caring for the children, making sure they ate and finished their homework. Toledo also went to school with plans to become a barber.\n\nBut the marriage hit rough times at least in part because Suarez felt that Toledo was neglecting his duties at home. He spent too much time playing video games.\n\nAs the marriage soured, Suarez began an affair with Kevin Dredden, a married coworker at American K9 Solutions. Toledo grew suspicious and placed a spy device on her phone and discovered the affair. In a rage he drove to her workplace in Lake Mary on Oct. 22, 2013, where he angrily confronted her. Someone called police. He left before an officer arrived.\n\nSuarez drove with her two children to her mother\u2019s house that night. Toledo also went there and the two talked things over and agreed to end their marriage. Toledo left the house. Then Toledo did something. He turned off his cellphone.\n\nNieves Perez tried to convince her daughter to remain at her house. But the daughter said she wanted to sleep in her own bed and took her two children to the home she shared with Toledo, about a block away. That\u2019s the last time the grandmother saw her daughter and grandchildren.\n\nAbout 1 a.m. Suarez finished speaking with Dredden, who had called to see how she was doing. About 6 a.m. Toledo knocked on the window of his neighbor Tyshawn Jackson\u2019s bedroom asking for help in moving Suarez\u2019s car.\n\nIt was between those hours that Toledo committed the murders and apparently put the three bodies into the trunk of his wife\u2019s car then drive them somewhere.\n\nAuthorities would later find some sand in her car but it was too common to be of any help.\n\n\u201cI snapped\u201d\n\nJackson testified at Toledo\u2019s murder trial how he had followed in Toledo\u2019s Saturn while Toledo drove his wife\u2019s Honda to a shopping center in Seminole County. Jackson said he drove up as Toledo was wiping down the car. Toledo put some items in the Saturn, got behind the wheel and drove behind an apartment complex in Seminole County. Jackson told investigators Toledo threw some things in a dumpster before driving back to Deltona.\n\nJackson also told police Toledo said, \u201cI snapped.\u201d\n\nInvestigators went to the dumpster and found the trunk mat for Suarez car and a pair of Toledo\u2019s boots. They found a drop of the little girl\u2019s blood on one of Toledo\u2019s boots. They also found a little of her blood on the trunk mat. Back at the family house in Deltona they found traces of the little girl\u2019s blood in the master bathroom.\n\nBut that\u2019s all they have found of the mother and her two children.\n\nToledo at first told Volusia County Sheriff\u2019s Office investigators he didn\u2019t know where his family was. But his demeanor changed after Volusia County Sheriff\u2019s Office Detective Sgt. A.J. Pagliari told Toledo investigators he had been seen driving his wife\u2019s car.\n\nRed flags also went up when Pagliari asked, \u201cDo you think that your wife and children are alive?\u201d Toledo\u2019s answer was, \u201d \u2018I feel their alive.\u2019 It wasn\u2019t, \u2018Yeah, they\u2019re alive. What are we doing here? You need to be out there searching and I want do do everything that I can.\u2019\n\n\u201cIf you had seen them, truly seen them, when you left the house after the argument, like you said you did, then the answer should have been, \u2018Well, they\u2019re definitely alive,\u2019 \u201d Pagliari said.\n\nToledo eventually admitted to killing his wife with a strike to her throat but he made it sound like he had lashed out as if in self-defense and killed her unintentionally. And he tearfully blamed the children\u2019s death on his neighbor, Jackson. He broke down as he claimed that Jackson killed the children with a hatchet to eliminate them as witnesses.\n\nInvestigators and prosecutors discounted that saying Toledo was lying. Pagliairi testified at trial that Toledo had killed them all.\n\n\u201cLuis can take responsibility for his wife because he feels wronged by her,\u201d he said.\n\nHe can\u2019t admit to the children, the investigator added.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t brutally murder young people and people that you said you cared about and built bonds with, so it\u2019s easy to place that on Tyshawn, because that is the most heinous of heinous,\u201d Pagliari testified.\n\n10-2\n\nBecause of pre-trial publicity the case was moved to St. Augustine. It took four years for the case to go to trial. At the end, the jury deliberated a day before finding Toledo guilty of second-degree murder in Suarez\u2019s death and two counts of first-degree murder in the children\u2019s slayings.\n\nAfter a break in the trial, the penalty phase followed with prosecutors Mark Johnson and Ryan Will focused on convincing the jurors that Toledo deserved death for killing the children. Toledo\u2019s team of three lawyers, Jeff Deen, Michael Nielsen and Michael Nappi, argued among other things that Toledo had been admitted to a psychiatric hospital when he was 4 or 5 years old.\n\nProsecutors faced a greater challenge since court decisions and the Legislature had tightened the state\u2019s death penalty law so that all 12 jurors had to recommend death. The jury voted 10 to 2 for death.\n\nNielsen said that he has not heard from Toledo since his sentencing on Jan. 19. The killing who is appealing his conviction. He said you have to give jurors who may not be too \u201cgung-ho\u201d about the death penalty something to hang their hat on, like the psychiatric hospital admission.\n\n\u201cWhen you are that young and you are committed to a psychiatric hospital that\u2019s pretty intense,\u201d Nielsen said.\n\nCircuit Judge Raul Zambrano sentenced Toledo to three consecutive life terms. Zambrano said that he believed Toledo planned to kill the moment he turned off his phone.\n\nR.J. Larizza, the state attorney for the 7th Circuit, said on Friday that all murder cases are heartbreaking but this one deserved the ultimate punishment.\n\n\u201cThis was a case we sought the death penalty on and those are cases that we are very selective on and I think that says a lot,\u201d Larizza said.\n\nLarizza praised Nieves Perez and other family members of the victims as strong and family oriented.\n\n\u201cI was grateful that at least we were able to help them find some peace by being able to get a conviction and holding Toledo accountable for what he did,\u201d Larizza said.\n\nIf the bodies are ever found it will likely be because Toledo decided to talk, said Tad DiBiase, a former federal prosecutor who wrote a book about no-body murders. He said there have been 517 no-body murder cases that have gone to trial since the 1830s in the United States.\n\nIn only a handful of those were the bodies ever found.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not unheard of but it\u2019s very rare and typically when the body is found afterward it\u2019s only because the defendant decided to cooperate as part of a plea deal or to get out of a death penalty,\u201d DiBiase said. \u201cSome type of benefit to him is usually the only way the body is found.\u201d\n\nNieves Suarez said other families who have missing loved ones will be at the awareness ceremony on Tuesday. She said they try to support each other as members of a family of heartache and grief.\n\n\u201cWe belong to the family that you don\u2019t want to belong. It\u2019s sad to say, but its reality,\u201d Nieves Suarez said.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Daytona Beach (Fla.)

Only this time around, the focus is not just on the food, but also the chefs and business owners behind it.\n\nNov. 4 through 11 is DMV Black Restaurant Week \u2014 a seven day lineup of competitions, conversations, conferences and meal deals at bars, restaurants and coffee shops throughout the D.C. area.\n\nGeorgetown University professor Erinn Tucker, bar consultant Andra Johnson and chef/entrepreneur Furard Tate are the organizers behind the event that aims to shine a spotlight on an underrepresented population in the hospitality industry.\n\n\u201cHere in the DMV, there is just so much talent, but at the same time, I\u2019ve been reading a lot of stories that say, \u2018Where are the black chefs? And where are the black managers and (general managers)?\u2019 And they\u2019re actually here, but there\u2019s no platform,\u201d said Tucker, who holds a Ph.D. in hospitality administration.\n\nSimilar to a traditional restaurant week model, diners can expect to find prix fixe meal specials at a handful of participating restaurants. Businesses that don\u2019t have the ability to serve multicourse meals \u2014 including coffee shops and fast-casual or carryout establishments \u2014 will offer discounts on menu items.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re asking that the consumer be more educated in what they eat, where they eat, how they eat, because then that literally changes the whole industry,\u201d said Tate, who ran a barbecue restaurant on H Street before he was pushed out to make room for a new development.\n\n\u201cWe, as a community, (can) begin to build and sustain these restaurants for years to come.\u201d\n\nIn addition to highlighting professionals already in the industry, DMV Black Restaurant Week wants to help those interested in joining the culinary arts. Tate said there are plenty of schools and training programs in the area for teens and young adults who want jobs. What\u2019s missing is the support they need to land those jobs once they graduate.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a bridge that needs to be built right now,\u201d Tucker added.\n\nSetting future generations up for success and other topics, such as raising capital and sustaining business relationships, will be a part of the culminating all-day educational conference at University of the District of Columbia on Saturday, Nov. 10.\n\nOther events throughout the week include a cocktail competition on Nov. 5 and a conversation at The Wing on Nov. 8 with Elle Simone of the SheChef movement, which works to bridge gender and race gaps in the kitchen.\n\nA list of participating restaurants, as well as tickets and information to the week\u2019s events, are available on DMV Black Restaurant Week\u2019s website. Both Tucker and Tate said the week is just the beginning to what they hope is a continuing conversation and calendar of programming.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: WTOP-FM, http://www.wtop.com", "In this Wednesday, Oct. 31, 2018 photo, Bernie Gerlach, left, Jennifer Alomari, center, and Katie Topham, right, comfort each other as the Hershee Bar, Hampton Roads' last lesbian bar, is open for the final night in Norfolk, Va.

Sandwiched between them was a sign.\n\n\u201cThank you Hershee Bar for \u2018being there\u2019 for me when no one else was,\u201d it read.\n\nInside, flashing lights lit up the dance floor. A 1990s R&B mix blared through the speakers as people dressed as Run DMC, Minnie Mouse and pharaohs flashed their driver\u2019s licenses to get in.\n\nIt was their last night to grab drinks and feast on shrimp and french fries at the bar on Sewells Point Road before the building is torn down and the property is sold to the city. At 1:45 a.m., supporters said on social media, police arrived and watched the doors from the parking lot.\n\nBernie Gerlach was there with her two friends, Christi Hogge and Rene Hayes.\n\nShe met them at Hershee in 1998, she said.\n\nFor the past 20 years, the trio has gone there to remember lost loved ones, attend wedding receptions and unwind, they said. The bar was a safe haven for lesbians when it first opened, said Gerlach, who\u2019s from Newport News.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re losing our home,\u201d she said.\n\nIn February, the City Council voted unanimously to spend $1.5 million on the property in the Five Points neighborhood. Hershee was told to leave after Oct. 31.\n\nCharles Cooper, who owns the property, asked the city to buy the lot in 2017 after his family removes the buildings, The Pilot reported. Cooper\u2019s son has said the bar was not targeted and other nearby businesses would also be affected by the sale.\n\nMost recently, a spokesperson for Gov. Ralph Northam said they had received four calls by Wednesday afternoon about the bar, but an application to designate the location as historic had not been filed.\n\nBar owner Annette Stone hugged customers as she walked in Wednesday night. Over 200 people showed up, she said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s overwhelming,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I expected that because that\u2019s how great these people are. That\u2019s how much this bar means to them.\u201d\n\nStone and a group of her supporters both posted on Facebook in the early hours Thursday that several Norfolk police officers showed up about 1:45 a.m., minutes before the bar shut down for good.\n\nMichael Carney also came to celebrate one last time.\n\nHe has been visiting the bar since it opened in 1983, and he was one of the few men allowed into the bar back then, he said.\n\n\u201cThere were maybe four or five of us who could get past the door person,\u201d Carney said. \u201cMen would come in and harass the girls.\u201d\n\nWhen his partner died, he went to Hershee to find solace. He went through a three-day depression when he found out the fate of the bar, he said.\n\n\u201cToday was also a very emotional day,\u201d said Carney. \u201cThe reality of it. I\u2019ve dealt with it, but a lot of people haven\u2019t.\u201d\n\nLakela Fuller, who has been going to Hershee since she was 18, showed up, too. The bar\u2019s staff has seen her at her best and her worst, she said, grinning and pointing toward Burt McManus, a bartender at Hershee for 34 years.\n\nMcManus and other staff at Hershee have taken care of her and helped her accept who she is, she said.\n\nIf the bar ever opens in another location, she said, she\u2019ll be there.\n\n\u201cWhatever place they tell me they\u2019re going, I will go,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a family.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Virginian-Pilot, http://pilotonline.com", "In this Oct. 16, 2018 photo, Ralph Herron keeps pieces of recognition he has earned over the years in a corner wall in his home in Fairmont, W.Va..

(Eddie Trizzino/Times-West Virginian via AP)\n\nFAIRMONT, W.Va. (AP) \u2014 Ralph Herron has been involved with the Boy Scouts of America for almost his whole life.\n\nWhile he worked with the program in his later years as his sons were participants in the group, he still continues to serve as a coordinator with the United Methodists of West Virginia.\n\n\u201cI have been involved in Boy Scouts ever since I was a youth, 50 years as a matter of fact,\u201d Herron, who attends Highlawns United Methodist Church in Rivesville, said. \u201cI stuck with it because I really believe it\u2019s a good program, and if I didn\u2019t believe in it, I wouldn\u2019t have stayed with it as long as I have.\u201d\n\nIn part due to these efforts and more, Herron has been named West Virginia United Methodist Man of the Year by the organization the West Virginia United Methodist Men. For Herron, the honor is one he never saw coming, as his service to his church and his community just come as part of the religion.\n\n\u201cTo be even considered it\u2019s a pretty good honor,\u201d Herron said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good honor. I was shocked that I was actually chosen, but I was.\u201d\n\nAside from his work with the Scouts, Herron also serves as chairperson of staff-Parrish relations for the church, is on its board of trustees and assists in the children\u2019s service event \u201cKids for Christ.\u201d He also volunteers with community organizations such as the Salvation Army.\n\n\u201cIt keeps me busy,\u201d Herron laughed. \u201cSometimes we have something every weekend and I go to a lot of meetings during the week.\u201d\n\nHowever, probably his biggest duty is helping to organize the annual circuit rider in Jackson\u2019s Mill, which is a gathering where hundreds of individuals camp out on the site for a weekend.\n\n\u201cWe have several hundred campers out at Jackson\u2019s Mill,\u201d Herron said. \u201cThey do activities during the day, and then have a meal in the evening there in the dining hall and then we have a Sunday service down there.\u201d\n\nIt was at this circuit rider that Herron found he had won the honor, being recognized among the officers of the United Methodist Men attending the event.\n\n\u201cThey go over the candidates and then they choose the Man of the Year at the circuit rider,\u201d Herron said. \u201cThey keep saying \u2018It was a long time coming.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe organization of the United Methodist Men picks a recipient of this recognition each year out of the nominations made by other members. Herron said he was nominated by two of his colleagues, as he is known in the community and throughout West Virginia for his work with the scouts.\n\n\u201cDistricts nominate people for the Man of the Year,\u201d Herron said. \u201cA lot of them know me because I\u2019ve been the conference scouting coordinator for the West Virginia conference for 14 years.\u201d\n\nAccording to George Hohmann, president of the United Methodist Men, the group started the award in 1954, then called the \u201cLayman of the Year.\u201d It was changed in the 1970s to \u201cMan of the Year,\u201d and has consistently been given to a member of the organization.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time,\u201d Hohmann said. \u201cThere\u2019s a plaque down at Charleston\u2019s office that\u2019s got names on it and it\u2019s a pretty big plaque.\u201d\n\nHerron\u2019s name will be added to that plaque, in recognition of this honor. Hohmann also said the selection process for the Man of the Year was different this year because there was actually more than one nominee.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s usually up to the president and executive committee,\u201d Hohmann said. \u201cIt was a pretty interesting process this year because there were several nominees, so they had to wrestle with that.\u201d\n\nOn Herron himself, Hohmann agreed the award has been a long time coming, having known of him and his efforts for a long time.\n\n\u201cI can say that I\u2019ve known Ralph for probably 30 years,\u201d Hohmann said. \u201cHe\u2019s always been active in his church and active with the scouts.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s probably one of the most widely known scout leaders in the state.\u201d\n\nFinally being recognized for his work with the church, Herron commented that this work is never done, as he will continue to be an active participant for as long as he can.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad to do those things,\u201d Herron said. \u201cThey\u2019re good organizations to help, and I can see the benefit.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Times West Virginian, http://www.timeswv.com", "This Wednesday Oct. 24, 2018 photo shows Wheeling municipal workers Barb Janetski, seated, Judy Rice, left, and Karen Grimes in the office in Wheeling W.Va. It might sound like the Dark Ages, but those are some of the early memories of three Wheeling city employees who mark 50 years on the job this year. (Heather Ziegler/The Intelligencer via AP)\n\nWHEELING, W.Va. (AP) \u2014 Judy Rice operated the first modern computer in the City-County Building. Karen Grimes remembers when women were not permitted to wear slacks to work. Barb Janetski said it was an acceptable practice to terminate a woman\u2019s job if she got married.\n\nIt might sound like the Dark Ages, but those are some of the early memories of three Wheeling city employees who mark 50 years on the job this year. They have shared the same elevators, walked the same halls and continue to enjoy a friendship they liken to a sisterhood. None of them has immediate plans to retire.\n\nJanetski, 70, began her work duties at the City-County Building switchboard, something obsolete today. She also had various secretarial positions with the city including stints as secretary for the then-Elby\u2019s Distance Race and the Human Rights Commission among others. She has spent the longest number of years as the right-hand woman in the Recreation Department alongside soon-to-retire recreation director Tom Bechtel and Gene Ammirante. Together they expanded and have maintained a recreation department that sees multiple generations of youngsters enjoy the activities offered by the city. She remains in that post today. She also worked with Frank Rodriguez, civic center manager, whose office was in the Recreation Department while the Wheeling Civic Center (WesBanco Arena) was under construction.\n\n\u201cWe really are like sisters. We do things together outside of work. We have bowled together, were in minstrel shows at the Capitol and we were even bicentennial belles during that celebration .. That tells you how long we\u2019ve been around,\u201d Janetski said.\n\nAs for the recreation department, Janetski has seen generations of seasonal workers come through the doors. For years, the recreation department was located in the basement of the City-County Building. A storage closet actually had a dirt floor. Despite it\u2019s close quarters, the department churned out tons of recreation schedules and provided summer employment for hundreds of kids at city-owned pools and playgrounds. She said her first paycheck totaled $85 for two weeks work.\n\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t bad money for the time,\u201d Janetski said. \u201cEvery job was a great experience and working with each director and solicitor was a pleasure. I gained so much knowledge over the years with all the added positions.\u201d\n\nBechtel, who has 44 years in the department, quipped that Janetski \u201cwas the best boss I ever had.\u201d He said she is a good sport having dealt with all kinds of situations over the years. \u201cI couldn\u2019t do it without her.\u201d\n\nGrimes, 69, said she began her duties with the city in the water department posting bills. She moved on to work in the city manager\u2019s office. She, too, had a hand in the development of the civic center, as she was tasked with checking signatures on petitions regarding the civic center issue before voters. Grimes also spent seven years in the city planning office, now known as the development department.\n\nIn 1975, Grimes became the second female civilian worker in the Wheeling Police Department. Only the jail had another female matron on staff, she recalled.\n\nSince taking their first steps into city employment, Grimes, Janetski and Rice have watched 12 city managers come and go, saw the first black council member \u2014 Clyde Thomas \u2014 elected as well as the first female mayor \u2014 Stella Koerner. She also recalled her first paycheck was $95 for two weeks work.\n\n\u201cThey (city managers) didn\u2019t last long, maybe two years, when we first started. Most of the city managers worked in planning and just moved down the hall into the manager\u2019s office,\u201d Grimes noted.\n\nAs secretary for the Wheeling Police Department, Grimes has worked with seven chiefs since 1975. She said Ed Weithe spent the most time as chief with 17 years at the helm. When asked who was her favorite, Grimes said, \u201cThey all had their strengths.\u201d\n\nDiplomacy is one of her greatest strengths, according to those around her. Chief Shawn Schwertfeger will attest to that.\n\n\u201cKaren and I communicated even before I started. My whole transition was a lot easier thanks to her. She\u2019s just that kind of person, Schwertfeger said.\n\nThe chief said Grimes handles many internal processes in the police department. \u201cShe knows everyone and everything. I\u2019m very grateful to have her . she is someone who is irreplaceable.\u201d\n\nGrimes said she\u2019s excited about the plans for a new safety force building if voters approve a bond levy measure toward the end on Nov. 6. She plans to stick around to see it through.\n\nRice, the youngest of the three at 68, also began her employment in the water department office where she said did billing. She said the first computer in the building was placed in the water department and she was first to operate it. Later she moved on to duties in the finance office where she worked as a bookkeeper. She said another woman completed the city payroll by hand. \u201cShe handed out every check, too,\u201d Rice said.\n\nShe recalls receiving $128 for two weeks pay. Rice said over the years with so many people coming and going in city jobs, there was always a fun, family-type atmosphere. She recalled Halloween parties and other holiday parties where all departments mingled and had fun. Rice said after all the years, she and the other two women earn four weeks vacation per year.\n\n\u201cThese have been good jobs,\u201d Rice said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of fun times here.\u201d\n\nAll of the women said they enjoy their work although they would one day like to retire. However, as non-uniformed city workers, they have not been afforded the same benefits as police and fire or administrators over the years. They attribute that to lack of leadership among the non-uniformed workers to fight for better benefits in Charleston.\n\nTheir classification set by the state freezes their pension earnings after 35 years of service.\n\nThe most they can earn toward their pension is 70 percent of their pay at 35 years, they explained. In other words, the past 15 years of employment do not count toward their pensions.\n\nJanetski said she has written letters to elected officials in the state urging change in the pension plan for the non-uniformed workers, but has not received any feedback.\n\n\u201cEveryone has the right to retire with a decent wage. That\u2019s all we are asking for,\u201d she said.\n\nCity Manager Robert Herron said all three women have an excellent work ethic, something he appreciates in an employee.\n\n\u201cI know all three of them. I\u2019ve had the pleasure of working with them for 16 and 1/2 years. Even though they have achieved the 50-year mark, they all three are still very productive city employees. I know what their work ethic is and it\u2019s solid.\u201d\n\nHe acknowledged that the current city council has made it a priority to address the wage and benefit concerns of the municipal workers. \u201cThey are trying to figure it out,\u201d he said.\n\nUntil then, none of the ladies have circled a retirement date on any particular calendar year.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Intelligencer, http://www.theintelligencer.net", "BELLEFONTE, Del. (AP) \u2014 Patricia Kostyshyn wants to know the meaning behind the quirkiest landmark in Bellefonte.\n\nWhy, why, why, is there a bathtub sitting on an island in the middle of the town\u2019s main thoroughfare at Brandywine Boulevard and Bellefonte Avenue?\n\nKostyshyn, who lives in the town of roughly 1,193 people southwest of Wilmington, says it has been there for years.\n\nIs it art? Is it an eyesore? Is it a subtle, subliminal \u201clet\u2019s keep things clean\u201d message?\n\nIt\u2019s a very nice, vintage-looking bathtub. The heavy clawfoot tub appears to be cast-iron and lined with white porcelain. Someone has even thoughtfully planted it with a lush variety of flowers and coleus.\n\nIt just looks kind of funny sitting there all by itself waiting for someone to fill it with warm water, and maybe some soap bubbles, and enjoy a long, relaxing soak.\n\nThat is after removing the dirt, flowers and plants. And only if you want to take a bath outside. In public. With the neighbors watching. And cars passing by.\n\nWhy, why, why, is there a bathtub on the street in Bellefonte?\n\nClawfoot bathtubs aren\u2019t exactly cheap. A new one can set you back anywhere from $800 to $1,800 depending on its size, materials and weight.\n\nAnd these kinds of tubs aren\u2019t exactly economical.\n\nClawfoot tubs can hold between 40 to 60 gallons of water. That means one good soak could completely drain your 40-gallon water heater, according to Boston Standard Company, a plumbing business in Beantown where clawfoot tubs abound in the city\u2019s older homes.\n\nThis tub isn\u2019t going anywhere easily. A classic clawfoot tub made of cast iron with a porcelain finish can weigh between 200 and 400 pounds. Add water or, in this case, dirt, and it will increase to between 500 and 900 pounds.\n\nThat\u2019s one heavy planter.\n\nYou can see the tub from the front yard of All American Roofing Co., but none of the employees could shed any light. The business has been at 1015 Brandywine Blvd. for four years, and they say the tub has been there since they moved in.\n\nA manager at Bellefonte Cafe at 804 Brandywine Blvd. says he drives by the intersection almost every day and said he never even noticed a tub was there until he was contacted by The News Journal.\n\nWe turned to Town Hall to solve The Curious Case of the Bellefonte Bathtub. No one seemed to know, so they tossed it out to their Facebook community.\n\nThere was a suggestion that the tub marks Bellefonte history going back to around 1915.\n\nAccording to News Journal archives, trolley service was needed for residents of Bellefonte because the suburban area was growing and transportation was needed into the city of Wilmington.\n\nBrandywine Boulevard had a trolley line that connected Bellefonte to Wilmington, but by about 1950, buses replaced the trolleys.\n\nWhen the service ended, Brandywine Boulevard went under construction. Cement remained on the street, and, as one legend goes, the tub was placed there so people wouldn\u2019t hit it.\n\nYeah. No. That\u2019s not it. Not at all, says Kathy MacDonough, a Bellefonte resident since 1993.\n\nShe says a tub has only been there since 2002, maybe even in 2003. How does MacDonough know?\n\nWhen she was a town commissioner, she and few others thought it would be kind of funny to move a tub onto the traffic island.\n\n\u201cWe decided to do it as a lark,\u201d says MacDonough, who now serves on the town\u2019s planning and zoning commission.\n\nThe first tub came from Teija Salmela, owner of the former Blueberry Hill Resale Shop. She ran the business from 1998 until she moved to Finland a few years ago. Her shop was located where All American Roofing is now. Salmela was known to collect large objects and had the tub in her side yard.\n\n\u201cI love old things. I hate to see anything go to waste,\u201d Salmela once told The News Journal.\n\nMacDonough can\u2019t remember why or how she and several others got the tub to the intersection. \u201cWe either dragged it or used a forklift.\u201d\n\nThe original tub, which began rusting over the years, might have been replaced around 2015, but MacDonough\u2019s not quite sure.\n\nInterestingly enough, the traffic island tub replaces two other former Bellefonte landmarks that have deeper and much more poignant Delaware history.\n\nThe traffic oval was once home to a monument listing the names of seven Delaware men who died in 1917 and 1918 during World War I. Near it was a \u201csalute gun\u201d owned by the Veterans of Foreign Wars Pugh-Lenderman-Chalfonte Post 2907.\n\nBoth are gone from the intersection.\n\nWhile the monument was moved and remains outside the VFW post on Brandywine Boulevard, the 1,675 pound gun is only a dim memory. It was collected in 1942 and taken away as part of a nationwide World War II metal salvage effort, according to News Journal archives.\n\nMeanwhile, the tub has remained for at least 15 years and MacDonough doesn\u2019t see it going anywhere anytime soon.\n\nWell, except that one time someone with a truck pushed it into the street in the middle of the night. And Susan Walton, owner of Bellefonte Vintage, recalls that her father, who worked as a consultant with an engineering company, temporarily moved the tub about 10 to 15 years ago because of some ongoing roadwork. He moved it back at Salmela\u2019s request.\n\nMacDonough says Salmela once planted flowers in the tub and decorated it for Easter, Christmas and other holidays. Russo Brothers plumbing contributed to the cost. In recent years, Bellefonte resident Patricia Anker has taken over the planting and maintenance of the tub\u2019s flowers.\n\nMacDonough thinks the quirky tub is staying put.\n\n\u201cThe plantings are so nice. It\u2019s become part of the scenery,\u201d she says.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The News Journal of Wilmington, Del., http://www.delawareonline.com", "WOODBURY, Vt.

Ever.\u201d\n\nBut the State of Ohio Board of Pharmacy says kratom is dangerous, addictive and possibly fatal to users. The panel has proposed classifying the main active ingredients in kratom \u2014 mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine \u2014 as schedule I controlled substances. The classification would place the ingredients in the category of drugs such as heroin, LSD and cocaine, effectively banning kratom.\n\nAli Simon, public- and policy-affairs liaison for the pharmacy board, said kratom has been banned in Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Rhode Island, Vermont, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia. It has also been banned in Denver, San Diego and Sarasota, Florida, according to the board\u2019s resolution proposing the classification.\n\nThe Ohio resolution says the substance has a history of use as a substitute for opium in southeast Asia and is classified as a controlled substance in 16 countries, including Thailand and Malaysia.\n\nKratom leaves are typically crushed and consumed in capsules or used in tea. The leaves are sometimes smoked or eaten raw.\n\nOn Wednesday, Smith welcomed a steady stream of visitors into his store. Many had never tried kratom, so he offered samples, mixing the bitter-tasting powdered substance with orange juice. He also offers kratom in capsules and chocolate bars.\n\nAmong his regular customers is Vanessa Bettinger, a 38-year-old restaurant manager from the Northwest Side who uses kratom for pain in a shoulder and knee and her back. She chooses it over medications that she knows could become addictive.\n\nInformation-technology specialist Rick Spires, 36, of the Grove City area, has used kratom for about a month to control attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and in place of energy drinks.\n\nGeorge Perkins, 68, a friend of Smith\u2019s in Indiana, said by phone that kratom has helped him keep nutrients in his body after expensive medications failed to control his digestive system following surgery to remove part of his colon.\n\nSmith said he\u2019s not opposed to regulation that ensures that consumers receive an unadulterated product; he just doesn\u2019t want kratom taken away from the people it helps.\n\nThe Drug Enforcement Administration lists kratom as a drug of chemical concern, according to the state report, and the Food and Drug Administration has issued a public-health advisory urging consumers not to use it.\n\nAnd, Simon said, the state health department found that six death certificates in Ohio from 2016 and 2017 listed kratom as a cause of death.\n\nBrad Lander, clinical director of addiction medicine at Ohio State University\u2019s Wexner Medical Center, said the center\u2019s Talbot Hall for substance abuse has treated some people for kratom addiction using the same criteria used for opioid addiction.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is that there are some good, positive properties to it, but it\u2019s pretty dangerous for society in general the way people use drugs,\u201d Lander said.\n\nThe pharmacy board received more the 6,000 emailed comments on the proposal by an Oct. 18 deadline. Simon said the board will review them in December. If the panel decides to pursue the rule, it will be subject to additional public-comment periods.\n\nAmong those speaking out is the American Kratom Association, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit group that presented a petition requesting that the board rescind its proposal.\n\nSmith, who lives in Delaware County, suffered a broken neck while racing in 2007, and he subsequently was addicted to opioids for three years. After going through rehab, he was depressed but didn\u2019t want to take antidepressants. That\u2019s when a friend suggested kratom.\n\n\u201cI cried,\u201d he said. \u201cLike, \u2018Oh, my God, I\u2019m back to Jack.\u2019 You know, the original Jack before I went to pain pills.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s changed my life that much.\u201d", "This photo taken Sept. 27, 2018, shows Kent Matte who is one of two prisoners who provide peer mentorship to prisoners with mental health challenges, a job that pays him $1 an hour, he said. \"(It's) just being friends with the guys and treating them like normal people instead of, 'Oh, you're below me because you take medication,'\" Matte said. (Marc Lester/Anchorage Daily News via AP)\n\nSEWARD, Alaska (AP) \u2014 Bill Lapinskas has two offices inside Spring Creek Correctional Center \u2014 one in Hollywood and one in Compton. Hollywood is his nickname for the businesslike administrative wing. Compton is a windowless, cinder block room on the ground floor, an arm\u2019s reach from the men convicted of the most serious offenses and dangerous behaviors. That\u2019s where Lapinskas would rather be.\n\nLapinskas, 49, is leading an effort to rethink Spring Creek, which he oversees. Ideas are like confetti in his brain, he said, to change the culture of the prison that holds 400-plus inmates and employs 169 people.\n\nMuch has already changed in Lapinskas\u2019 2 1/2 years in the top job. Increasingly, prisoners earn diplomas, turn to each other for sobriety and gather for high-minded discussions. They spend fewer days in solitary confinement. Some correctional officers, whose careers are historically prone to burnout, feel emboldened to bring new ideas to bear.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s burn people out doing the good work rather than burn people out fighting with hats and bats,\u201d said Lapinskas, who started as a correctional officer at Spring Creek 26 years ago.\n\nLapinskas hopes it\u2019s a movement away from the us-versus-them mentality that he said molders toxic attitudes and feeds the high recidivism rate for which all Alaskans pay.\n\n\u201cRather than menace them and just enforce rules every day, why aren\u2019t we trying to invoke change? Real change,\u201d he said. \u201cNot force it, but entice it and seduce it and get it out of these guys through meaningful conversation and decency.\u201d\n\nLapinskas said changes so far have cost the state little to nothing. Appreciative inmates emphasize that their sentences haven\u2019t changed inside Spring Creek\u2019s multiple razor-coil topped fences.\n\n\u201cThe capital-T truth is I will still shoot you dead-ass dead on the last fence,\u201d Lapinskas said of a hypothetical escape attempt. \u201cThat never goes away. Everything else is up for manipulation.\u201d\n\nThe Anchorage Daily News visited several offices, mods and classrooms in Spring Creek in September to speak with prisoners and staff about what\u2019s different under Lapinskas\u2019 watch at a time when Alaskans are increasingly frustrated with crime and punishment.\n\nPrisoners leading prisoners\n\nSpring Creek is tucked in a mountain valley on the eastern head of Resurrection Bay. Its yard has some of the view that tourists come to see from its opposite shore. But as the state\u2019s only maximum-security prison, it has been the place where some of the most dangerous Alaskans have been held, Robert Hansen, Louis Hastings and Joshua Wade among them.\n\nLapinskas said stopping by the prison\u2019s security office can provide a good reminder of who he\u2019s working with. There, staff can show him the collection of shanks they\u2019ve confiscated. On a cork board hang pictures of inmates grouped by gangs \u2014 some racist, some drug-addled, some violent. In January, Spring Creek correctional officers quelled a 43-inmate gang-related riot that injured five prisoners.\n\nBut Lapinskas said monitoring and identifying gangs has an upside that corrections officials have ignored. By identifying their leaders, he can engage them and, to some degree, call on them to tamp down disputes and violence before it boils. Security Sgt. Paul Wiest said it\u2019s not the pop-culture version of prison work that the public imagines.\n\n\u201cYou treat them with respect, they\u2019ll treat you with respect 99 times out of 100. You just need to treat them like they have some worth,\u201d Wiest said. \u201cAnd they\u2019re used to, a lot of these guys, being treated like they have no worth.\u201d\n\nHistorically, extending liberties hasn\u2019t always gone well. For many years, Lapinskas said, softball was a popular activity in the yard. That ended when a prisoner nearly beat another prisoner to death with the bat. Fights still occur a couple times a month, he said.\n\nBut of all the ideas Lapinskas has supported, none has seeded more change than the creation of the Restorative Justice Initiative, launched last year. Its 15 committee members, all prisoners, meet weekly to discuss ways inmates can help themselves.\n\n\u201cIt was more about getting people engaged,\u201d said prisoner Matt Moore, one of the group\u2019s three co-chairs. \u201cWe come from a standpoint that the stagnation and idle time is probably the most harmful aspect of the prison experience.\u201d\n\nInvolved prisoners and Lapinskas say they encountered naysayers and suspicion in the initiative\u2019s early days. For prisoners, it helped to have men like Lamont Moore, a former gang member from Compton, California, bridging the divide.\n\n\u201cMy credibility is good. I got all the stars and bars in that life,\u201d he said of his former affiliation. \u201cSo just because I\u2019m coming over here trying to talk to the man, I\u2019m just trying to work out something for us now. It\u2019s not just about me when I\u2019m here.\u201d\n\nThe restorative justice project created peer-led classes in business, art and fitness. They\u2019re hoping to create a Yup\u2019ik language class. Currently, RJI is advocating for elderly prisoners when the prison\u2019s policy doesn\u2019t account for their diminished capabilities. \u201cMan, we\u2019re playing bingo,\u201d Lamont Moore said. \u201cNobody thought we\u2019d be playing bingo at a maximum-security prison. Now, they\u2019re looking forward to it.\u201d\n\nOne initiative serves a mission close to Lapinskas\u2019 heart. It coordinates peer mentorship for prisoners working toward a GED. Lapinskas, who dropped out of East High School in Anchorage in the ninth grade, sometimes offers to show prisoners his own GED.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s all I got. I don\u2019t have any college, sitting here running an institution, $19 million budget, 160 employees,\u201d Lapinskas said.\n\nThe Restorative Justice Initiative also dangles a reward to encourage education: It raises money to buy a pizza or fried chicken dinner for anyone who earns a diploma. In a memo to the administration last month, RJI described the trajectory: In the fiscal year ending in July 2017, 22 men earned a GED. The following year, 55 did. In August 2018 alone, 17 GEDs were awarded, it said.\n\n\u201cIt should be noted that the incentive program achieved these increases for around $500 worth of fried chicken from the Carrs deli,\u201d the memo said.\n\nLeadership roles honed with restorative justice projects have contributed to other prisoner-led programs. Nine months ago, prisoner Brian Radel helped launch a sober living mod, where men trying to stay clean support and guide each other. They call the program Real Solutions. No other recovery service providers operate inside Spring Creek.\n\n\u201cI want to see them get their life together. Go out there and stay out,\u201d said Radel, the program\u2019s senior coordinator and a convicted murderer who said he might never get out of prison himself. He keeps recovery reference material in his tiny cell and writes workbooks the group uses.\n\nRadel says he hopes it\u2019s possible a prisoner who leaves Spring Creek clean might be steered away from committing crimes that might result in a death.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t know if that ever happens, but that\u2019s my hope, that I\u2019ll save a life since I took a life,\u201d he said.\n\nSegregation and mental health\n\nCorrectional officer Rhianna Sherman, 23, prefers to work in segregation, also known as seg, or solitary confinement, or the hole. It\u2019s busier there than in other mods, she said, and she likes that.\n\n\u201cYou get a little bit more interaction with them and a more personal sense,\u201d she said of the prisoners housed there. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of fun to hear their stories.\u201d\n\nSherman, who has worked in the job for two years, has only heard tales of what it was once like in seg, but some of those memories haunt Lapinskas from his days as a young correctional officer. He said he remembers once seeing a naked prisoner covered in his own feces, and being told by another C.O. that it was normal.\n\n\u201cNo planet do I want to be on where that\u2019s the norm,\u201d he said.\n\nSegregation remains a jarring sight. Inmates peer from tiny windows of their cell doors at any sign of activity in the mod. They stay in their cell about 23 hours a day, generally for one of two reasons: Either they\u2019ve been deemed a threat to prison security, or it\u2019s for their own protection. Some prisoners who believe they\u2019re in danger request segregation, which the prison obliges.\n\nWilliams, the corrections commissioner, said he sees Lapinskas as a change agent in reducing the use of segregation. He sent Lapinskas to Colorado to study its recent drastic reductions.\n\n\u201cWe have a long ways to go as a system, because we\u2019ve lived with a high use of segregation for a very long time,\u201d Williams said.\n\nLapinskas said segregation stays were once commonly measured in months, sometimes years. The prisoner was often unaware of when it might end, he said. Now, most instances have a 30-day limit, less if a prisoner will work with staff and clinicians to address the problem.\n\nInmates requesting protective custody can be steered toward a mod reserved for that purpose that does not use solitary confinement. Also, one of the four mods inside the segregation house is now reserved for a two-week transitioning period for prisoners before they return to general population \u2014 a level-up opportunity with some restored social interaction that segregated prisoners can work toward.\n\nBut perhaps the largest difference in the use of segregation might be the strategies in place at Spring Creek to keep prisoners out of it, particularly in the mod reserved for mentally ill people.\n\n\u201cA few weeks ago we had a guy that had a big outburst,\u201d said Robert Pack, a correctional officer in the mental health mod. \u201cIt used to be that we got a lot of officers in here and we would escort him to segregation.\u201d\n\nInstead, officers worked with peer mentors to de-escalate the situation. Two peer mentors live in the mental health mod to guide and protect mentally ill prisoners when trouble arises, as well as teach life skills and give day-to-day advice.\n\nKent Matte is one of two prisoners who provide peer mentorship to prisoners with mental health challenges, a job that pays him $1 an hour, he said. (Marc Lester / ADN)\n\nKent Matte is one of two prisoners who provide peer mentorship to prisoners with mental health challenges, a job that pays him $1 an hour, he said. (Marc Lester / ADN)\n\nOne is prisoner Kent Matte. He earns $1 an hour for up to 40 hours a week for his mentorship, he said.\n\n\u2033(It\u2019s) just being friends with the guys and treating them like normal people instead of, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re below me because you take medication.\u2019\n\n\u201cThis is a way to bridge that gap,\u201d Matte said. \u201cHere, these guys are part of the community too.\u201d\n\nRunning with an idea\n\nIn 2015, correctional officer Justin Ennis, 38, wrote down a career goal on his annual evaluation. He wanted to start a running club for prisoners. His reviewer drew a line through it, he said, and called it unrealistic.\n\n\u201cIt took a paradigm shift \u2014 him \u2014 to make that be real,\u201d Ennis said, motioning to Lapinskas.\n\nNow, the club meets Saturdays and Mondays in the prison yard to run laps on the quarter-mile path. Lately, about 30 prisoners and staff have been participating. Ennis\u2019 only rule is that no one uses running club time to talk about prison life and work.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have to look at us as correctional officers. I don\u2019t look at them as prisoners for that one hour,\u201d Ennis said. \u201cAs corny as it sounds, because it does sound corny, we\u2019re just runners.\u201d\n\nOpportunities to make his ideas real provide a boost in job satisfaction, he said. In September, he rode that high into a week he had scheduled to be off.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather be here working than be on vacation right now. That really sums it up right there,\u201d said Ennis, a facility standards officer. \u201cThis is where I\u2019m happy. We can effect change.\u201d\n\nFive staff members came in on their off time to help in September when the club hosted its first endurance race. That Saturday afternoon, runners had two hours to complete as many laps as possible. Three men ran 14.25 miles, then faced off for one final lap to determine who would stand atop the wooden podium the club built for the occasion.\n\nWhen it ended, 60 prisoners and staff members gathered at the finish line to cheer, Ennis said.\n\nEthics and morals\n\nIf the public is skeptical now about changes afoot at Spring Creek, prisoner Anthony Garcia thinks one day they\u2019re going to demand it. Alaskans would rather see decent human beings be returned from their prisons, he said. Though he\u2019ll live the rest of his own life in prison, he thinks he can help.\n\n\u201cI earned every year that I got, and I got a lot. I\u2019m not asking nobody to feel sorry for me or nothing like that,\u201d said Garcia, who was convicted of murder. \u201cBut I\u2019ve come to a certain point in time where I have something to teach the youngsters.\u201d\n\nEvery Friday morning Garcia leads a discussion about ethics and morals for any prisoner who wants to take part. Attendance is voluntary. Most weeks, the classroom is full.\n\nPrisoner Jason Vukovich, convicted of assault and robbery, has been recording the discussions for use in a podcast he\u2019s developing. He credits Lapinskas, not only for providing the prisoners latitude, but for joining them each week.\n\n\u201cHis words carry weight, because everybody in the room knows, man, the warden trusts us,\u201d Vukovich said.\n\nLapinskas recalls being derided as \u201csoft\u201d and \u201chug-a-thug\u201d by colleagues. It used to anger him, he said. Now, Lapinskas said he\u2019s focused on explaining his goals to whomever will listen. He estimates that he gives 10 tours a month.\n\n\u201cPeople need to understand what this is, so when they start saying things like, \u2018Oh, we need to be tough on crime.\u2019 No, we need to be smart on crime,\u201d Lapinskas said. \u201cTough on crime is a 66 percent recidivism rate.\u201d That number refers to the percentage of people who return to prison for parole or probation violations, or new criminal charges, within three years of release, according to the Department of Corrections.\n\nBen Turnbull, a shift supervisor for correctional officers, said not all changes have not been universally well received by staff. To some, changes in segregation seems like less deterrent for bad behavior. But he believes acceptance is growing overall.\n\n\u201cThe temperature on the yard, it\u2019s less tense in general,\u201d Turnbull said.\n\nCommissioner Williams said he responds to a skeptical public by making two points: Making prison life hell does not reduce the re-offense rate, he said, and about 95 percent of prisoners are going to be released sooner or later. Spring Creek will release 130 in the next 12 months, Lapinskas said.\n\n\u201cI do care about making prison systems more humane,\u201d Williams said. \u201cHowever, I am more concerned about making prisons that work.\u201d\n\nEarly one recent Friday morning, before joining Garcia\u2019s group to talk about how men should treat women, Lapinskas expressed hope that Spring Creek\u2019s direction would endure the pendulum swing of elected state leadership.\n\n\u201cI hope I challenge the status quo more than anybody else,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Anchorage Daily News, http://www.adn.com", "SAVANNAH, Ga. (AP) \u2014 While the heated governor\u2019s race between Democrat Stacey Abrams and Republican Brian Kemp has grabbed most of the attention, Georgia voters have several other key races to settle down the ballot Tuesday.\n\nDemocrats, shut out of holding any statewide office in Georgia since 2010, hope enthusiasm for Abrams\u2019 campaign will help them win back open seats for lieutenant governor, secretary of state and insurance commissioner.\n\nMeanwhile, two Republican members of Congress face strong Democratic challengers in metro Atlanta districts long considered safe for the GOP. And Republican incumbents on the utility-regulating Public Service Commission are running amid an outcry over spiraling costs for the Plant Vogtle nuclear plant expansion.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at some of the high-profile contests beyond the gubernatorial battle.\n\nOPEN SEATS\n\nThe election-season scramble to replace term-limited GOP Gov. Nathan Deal caused two fellow Republicans \u2014 Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle and Kemp, Georgia\u2019s secretary of state \u2014 to give up their seats for a shot at the governor\u2019s office.\n\nRepublican Geoff Duncan, a former state lawmaker, faced Democratic businesswoman Sarah Riggs Amico in the race for lieutenant governor. Duncan would be only the second Republican to hold the job since it debuted on the ballot in 1946. Democrats last won the No. 2 statewide office in 2002.\n\nFormer Democratic congressman John Barrow, who lost his House seat in 2014, is seeking a comeback in the race for secretary of state. Republican state Rep. Brad Raffensperger hopes to keep the office of Georgia\u2019s elections chief in GOP hands. Libertarian Smythe Duval is also on the ballot.\n\nGOP Insurance Commissioner Ralph Hudgens\u2019 decision to step down created yet another vacancy. Republican Jim Black, Hudgens\u2019 former chief of staff, is running to succeed his old boss against Democratic insurance agent Janice Laws. Also in the race is Libertarian Donnie Foster.\n\nOTHER STATEWIDE SHOWDOWNS\n\nRepublican Attorney General Chris Carr faces his first election test since the governor appointed him two years ago to fill the unexpired term of his predecessor, Sam Olens. Carr\u2019s opponent, Democrat Charlie Bailey, is a former Fulton County prosecutor who has argued lacks the legal experience the job demands.\n\nGOP state School Superintendent Richard Woods is seeking a second term against Democrat Otha Thornton Jr., who was the first black man to serve as president of the National PTA.\n\nRepublican Labor Commissioner Mark Butler is being challenged by Democrat Richard Keatley, a former professor of French and Italian. And Agriculture Commissioner Gary Black faced Democratic software developer Fred Swann.\n\nCONGRESSIONAL CHALLENGES\n\nTwo congressional in metro Atlanta are being closely watched as Democrats try to unseat two Republican House members in suburban districts known to favor the GOP. Democrats hope that shifting demographics and voters disaffected with Donald Trump will give them an opening.\n\nRepublican Rep. Karen Handel faces Democratic gun-control activist Lucy McBath, whose teenage son was fatally shot six years ago in Florida, in the 6th District north of Atlanta. It\u2019s Handel\u2019s second race since last year, when she won the House seat in a grueling special election against Democrat Jon Ossoff, who spent $30 million on the race.\n\nIn the neighboring 7th District, GOP Rep. Rob Woodall has been outpaced in fundraising by Democrat Carolyn Bourdeaux, a college professor at Georgia State University. Bourdeaux raised more than $1.9 million, nearly double Woodall\u2019s total. However, the four-term Republican congressman has won each of his prior elections with no less than 60 percent of the vote.\n\nFROM THE JAILHOUSE TO THE U.S. HOUSE?\n\nGOP Rep. Tom Graves already has a congressional district that strongly favors Republican candidates. This year, his Democratic opponent has been further handicapped by having to campaign from jail.\n\nDemocrat Steve Foster remains behind bars after a judge sentenced him to six months in jail for drunken driving in August. Still, Foster refused to quit the 14th District race in northwest Georgia. The misdemeanor DUI conviction doesn\u2019t disqualify him from the ballot.\n\nGeorgia Democrats are also challenging six more GOP congressmen: Reps. Buddy Carter, Drew Ferguson, Doug Collins, Jody Hice, Barry Loudermilk,and Rick Allen. Democratic Reps. Sanford Bishop, Hank Johnson and David Scott have GOP opponents.\n\nPUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION\n\nTwo Republican members of Georgia\u2019s utility-regulating Public Service Commission are defending their seats amid criticism over escalating costs for building two new nuclear reactors at Plant Vogtle near Augusta.\n\nGOP incumbent Chuck Eaton faces Democrat Lindy Miller and Libertarian Ryan Graham for the commission\u2019s District 3 seat in metro Atlanta. And Republican commissioner Pridemore is being challenged by Democrat Dawn Randolph Libertarian John Turpish for the PSC\u2019s District 5 seat in western Georgia.\n\nThe PSC has come under fire for its December vote authorizing construction to continue at Plant Vogtle, a decision made before Pridemore was appointed in February. The project is years behind schedule and billions of dollars over budget, raising concerns that ratepayers will get saddled with the added cost.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump on Saturday used his final Florida campaign event before next week\u2019s elections to implore supporters to send Republicans to the governor\u2019s mansion and the U.S. Senate, claiming that allowing Democrats to win either office would bring ruin to the state he also calls home.\n\nTrump returned to Florida for the second time this week to help rally support for Gov. Rick Scott, who is challenging Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson. Trump also sought to boost former Rep. Ron DeSantis, who is facing off against Andrew Gillum, the Democratic mayor of Tallahassee, in the race for governor.\n\nTrump argued that Gillum would \u201cdestroy Florida\u201d and claimed that Gillum\u2019s policies would be a \u201ctotal nightmare\u201d for the state.\n\n\u201cYou have only one choice, Ron DeSantis for governor,\u201d Trump told thousands of cheering supporters at a rally at Pensacola International Airport, with Air Force One park right outside of the hangar.\n\n\u201cIf you want to pay high taxes, you ought to vote for the mayor of Tallahassee,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou will destroy the state that I love.\u201d Trump noted that he also calls Florida home; his Mar-a-Lago estate is located in Palm Beach and he spends most weekends there in the winter.\n\nHe also said of the Democrat: \u201cAndrew Gillum is not equipped to be your governor. It\u2019s not for him.\u201d\n\nTrump criticized Nelson, too, claiming that he only sees the former astronaut \u201caround election time when he\u2019s on television every night.\u201d\n\nEarlier Saturday, Trump campaigned in Montana, where he made it clear that he wants to see Democrat Jon Tester booted from the Senate on Tuesday over a personal grudge as much as political ambition.\n\nTrump blames Tester for the defeat of his nominee to run the Department of Veterans Affairs. The president told hundreds of cheering supporters at a separate airport rally in the Montana chill that Tester \u201ctried to destroy\u201d Ronny Jackson, a Navy admiral and White House doctor.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m here,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI\u2019ve never forgotten it and it\u2019s honestly one of the reasons I\u2019m here so much,\u201d said Trump, who last campaigned in Montana in mid-October. \u201cIt\u2019s a disgrace, what he did to that man.\u201d\n\nTrump was in Montana to boost GOP Senate candidate Matt Rosendale, who is challenging Tester in Tuesday\u2019s election. The rallies are part of Trump\u2019s multistate blitz in the run-up to Tuesday\u2019s balloting, when control of the House and Senate \u2014 and perhaps the future of Trump\u2019s agenda \u2014 are at stake.\n\nTrump said having Rosendale in the Senate will be \u201cphenomenal.\u201d\n\nThe president blames Tester for the backlash against Jackson, who eventually withdrew his nomination after facing anonymous ethics allegations, including claims of on-the-job drunkenness and wrecking a government vehicle.\n\nJackson denied the allegations.\n\nTester, the top Democrat on the Senate committee that oversees veterans\u2019 issues, had released a list of the allegations against Jackson that was compiled by the committee\u2019s Democratic staff.\n\nTrump, however, doesn\u2019t mention that the allegations weren\u2019t the only factor that contributed Jackson withdrawing from consideration. Lawmakers questioned Jackson\u2019s limited managerial experience and his fitness to run a department as sprawling as the VA.\n\nAt both rallies, Trump sought to rally the energized crowds by talking up the economy and tax cuts, new Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, border security and several caravans of Central American migrants who are slowly advancing toward the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nHe mentioned plans for a new military branch called the Space Force, and complained anew about the news media.\n\nTrump also defended his decision to focus almost exclusively on the migrants and immigration in the closing days of the election. He recently announced that he intends to change asylum procedures, end the constitutional guarantee of birthright citizenship and build numerous \u201ctent cities\u201d to hold migrants caught crossing the border illegally.\n\n\u201cYou can only say so many times that we created 250,000 jobs last month,\u201d Trump said in Montana, in defense of his focus on immigration that some of the president\u2019s critics say amounts to fear-mongering. Trump has denied trying to instill fear as a reason to vote Republican on Election Day.\n\n\u201cWhen we\u2019re fixing a problem or fixed a problem there\u2019s no reason to go on about it for 45 minutes,\u201d Trump said.\n\nTrump also called up Rep. Greg Gianforte to speak from the podium but did not repeat his praise of the congressman, who was convicted of body slamming a journalist just before winning a 2017 special election. Trump had said during last month\u2019s Montana stop that anyone who can do a body slam \u201cis my kind of guy.\u201d\n\nThe president subsequently was criticized for seeming to glorify violence against journalists.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics\n\n___\n\nFollow Darlene Superville on Twttier: http://www.twitter.com/dsupervilleap", "Alina Zagitova of Russia performs during the ladies' free skating at the figure skating ISU Helsinki Grand Prix event in Helsinki, Finland, Saturday Nov. 3, 2018.

(Howard Koplowitz/AL.com via AP, File)\n\nBIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) \u2014 Hopeful after electing Doug Jones as U.S. senator and energized by their opposition to President Donald Trump, Alabama Democrats have more candidates running for statewide office in 2018 than they did four years ago \u2014 nine this year as opposed to six in 2014. Statewide races are on the ballot from governor on down.\n\nBut whether Democrats can pick off even one Republican incumbent in a deep red state is an entirely different matter.\n\nNo Democrat holds statewide office in Montgomery, and Alabama\u2019s nine-member delegation to Washington includes seven Republicans. But starting with the race between GOP Gov. Kay Ivey and Democratic challenger Walt Maddox, Democrats are expressing more optimism than in recent years.\n\nHere are some of the top races and issues to watch in Alabama on Election Day:\n\nLIEUTENANT GOVERNOR\n\nAlabama hasn\u2019t even had a lieutenant governor since April 2017, when Kay Ivey was elevated from the position to become governor following Robert Bentley\u2019s resignation. That\u2019s about to change.\n\nRepublican state Rep. Will Ainsworth and Democrat Will Boyd are vying to become lieutenant governor. The main job of the office is to preside over the state Senate.\n\nAinsworth was first elected to the Alabama House four years ago. The North Alabama resident billed himself as Christian conservative who will set a higher ethical standard at a Statehouse tainted by repeated scandals in recent years.\n\nBoyd is a minister from Florence. He has made several unsuccessful bids for public office, including last year when he sought the Democratic nomination for the seat now held by Jones.\n\nATTORNEY GENERAL\n\nThe race to be Alabama\u2019s attorney general features an odd dynamic \u2014 the challenger may have better name recognition than the incumbent.\n\nRepublican Attorney General Steve Marshall, an appointee who previously served as a county prosecutor in north Alabama, is being opposed by Democrat Joseph Siegelman, the son one of the best-known names in state politics, former Gov. Don Siegelman.\n\nMarshall, 53, took over in February 2017 after Luther Strange was appointed to the U.S. Senate. He endured personal tragedy earlier this year when his wife Bridgette took her own life in June just weeks before the Republican runoff.\n\nSiegelman, 30, is a Birmingham attorney who was making his first bid for public office. While many voters might recognize his name because of his father, they also might attach some unwanted baggage to it. Don Siegelman, Alabama\u2019s last Democratic governor, served time in federal prison after being convicted in a bribery conspiracy.\n\nCONGRESS\n\nSix contested congressional seats are on the ballot, highlighted by the race for the District 3 office that represents much of eastern Alabama.\n\nRepublican Rep. Mike Rogers of Saks is being challenged Democrat and former Miss America Mallory Hagan of Opelika as he seeks a ninth term in the solidly GOP district.\n\nWhile Hagan has portrayed Rogers as being out of touch with voters after years in Washington, Rogers has cast himself as a solid conservative who supports the president on issues including border security and strengthening the military.\n\nIn other races, GOP Rep. Bradley Byrne of Fairhope is opposed by Democrat Robert Kennedy Jr. of Mobile in District 1, and Republican Rep. Martha Roby of Montgomery is being challenged by Democrat Tabitha Isner in District 2 of southeastern Alabama.\n\nEleven-term Republican Rep. Robert Aderholt of Haleyville is on the ballot in the District 4 of north central Alabama against Democrat Lee Auman, a camp manager from Union Grove. Democrat Peter Joffrion is attempting to unseat four-term Republican Rep. Mo Brooks of Huntsville in District 5.\n\nIn the 6th District of metro Birmingham, GOP Rep. Gary Palmer is seeking a third term against Democrat Danner Kline, an early leader of Alabama\u2019s craft beer industry.\n\nCONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS\n\nConstitutional amendments about the hot-button topics of abortion and religion could help drive turnout on Tuesday.\n\nVoters will decide whether to add anti-abortion language to Alabama\u2019s 1901 constitution specifying that the state recognizes the \u201crights of unborn children.\u201d The measure does not impact abortion access unless Roe v. Wade, the U.S. Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion, is reversed.\n\nThe statewide ballot also includes a constitutional amendment regarding the display of the Ten Commandments in public schools and government buildings. The proposal would allow for the display the Old Testament laws in a way that \u201ccomplies with constitutional requirements\u201d such as being intermingled with historical documents.\n\nBoth issues could help bring GOP voters to the polls given the numbers of Christian conservatives who vote Republican in the state.\n\nSUPREME COURT\n\nThe ballot includes two contested races for Alabama Supreme Court, including the top position on the nine-member panel.\n\nRepublican Alabama Supreme Court Associate Justice Tom Parker and Democratic Circuit Judge Bob Vance Jr. of Birmingham are vying for the office of chief justice.\n\nParker was elected to the Supreme Court in 2004. His campaign appealed to social conservatives and emphasized his hope of one day overturning U.S. Supreme Court decisions such as the one that legalized abortion.\n\nVance was endorsed by six former chief justices, including three Republicans.\n\nIn the other Supreme Court race, Birmingham attorney Jay Mitchell and Jasper attorney Donna Wesson Smalley are both seeking the Place 4 position on the state\u2019s highest court.", "MANCHESTER, N.H.

That\u2019s up from last year\u2019s $2.47 billion, or $1.65 per B share, when insurance losses from several hurricanes hurt results.\n\nBuffett has long said Berkshire\u2019s operating earnings offer a better view of quarterly performance because they exclude investments and derivatives, which can vary widely.\n\nBy that measure, Berkshire reported operating earnings of $6.88 billion, or about $2.79 per Class B share. That\u2019s up from $3.44 billion, or about $1.40 per B share.\n\nThe Omaha-based company\u2019s revenue grew to $63.45 billion in the quarter, which was up from $59.5 billion last year. Berkshire Hathaway officials do not typically comment on the company\u2019s quarterly earnings.\n\n\u201cOverall, it\u2019s a very strong report,\u201d said Andy Kilpatrick, a retired stockbroker and author who wrote \u201cOf Permanent Value: The Story of Warren Buffett.\u201d\n\nBerkshire\u2019s insurance unit, which includes Geico and several large reinsurance firms, reported a $441 million underwriting profit in the quarter. That\u2019s much better than last year\u2019s $1.4 billion underwriting loss when hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria caused devastation and Mexico endured earthquakes.\n\nBurlington Northern Santa Fe railroad added $1.4 billion to Berkshire\u2019s quarterly profits, up from $1 billion a year ago. BNSF has hauled 5 percent more freight in the first nine months of the year, signaling that the economy remains strong.\n\nThe biggest swing in Berkshire\u2019s quarterly profit came from an $11.5 billion gain in the value of its investments. A year ago, Berkshire reported only a $423 million investment gain. New accounting rules that took effect this year forced Berkshire to change the way it records the value of its investments.\n\nDuring the quarter, Berkshire repurchased some of its own stock for the first time in several years after loosening its restrictions on the practice. Buffett spent $928 million to repurchase 225 Class A shares and 4.1 million Class B shares during the quarter.\n\nEdward Jones analyst Jim Shanahan said investors will appreciate that Buffett followed through on the new buyback program and purchased shares.\n\n\u201cThis will send a strong signal in equity markets,\u201d Shanahan said.\n\nBut the fact that Berkshire is buying its own stock while holding more than $100 billion in cash and short-term investments is a reminder that Buffett hasn\u2019t been able to find other large acquisitions and investments at attractive prices recently.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Inc. owns more than 90 companies, including the railroad and clothing, furniture and jewelry businesses.

(AP Photo/Josh Boak)\n\nEXTON, Pennsylvania (AP) \u2014 For many voters in America\u2019s affluent suburbs, a flourishing economy is forcing a thorny dilemma for the midterm elections.\n\nDo they vote Democratic, in part to protest President Donald Trump for behavior some see as divisive and unpresidential? Or do they back Republicans in hopes that the economy will continue thriving under the majority party?\n\nA healthy economy has at least complicated their decision and blurred the outcome of the midterm elections . On Friday, the government reported that employers added a robust 250,000 jobs in October. And the unemployment rate stayed at a five-decade low of 3.7 percent.\n\nAt stake Tuesday is control of the House and Senate, both now led by Republican majorities. Steady economic growth and a vigorous job market haven\u2019t been the clincher in prosperous areas that were once seemingly safe Republican turf. Partly as a result, many analysts say Democrats stand a good chance of regaining control of the House even while Republicans maintain the Senate.\n\nThe ambivalence of many voters is evident in the Philadelphia suburbs of Bucks and Chester counties. The landscape of rolling hills is dotted by shopping plazas and luxury car dealerships, by fieldstone and stucco houses that fill cul-de-sacs. Residents are likelier than the country as a whole to have college degrees, and the median family income is about $100,000.\n\nInterviews with about a dozen people elicited a range of sentiments about whether and how the economy might affect their votes. For some, all that matters is the energized pace of job growth, which began under President Barack Obama and has continued under Trump.\n\nOthers, some of them lifelong Republicans, are finding their loyalties tested by a president who embraces tariffs, disparages refugees and attacks political opponents. With Pennsylvania also holding votes for governor and a Senate seat, many said they were willing to split their votes between the parties.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a fan of Donald Trump,\u201d said 85-year-old Ross Kershey. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t respect checks and balances. But he\u2019s certainly done well for the economy.\u201d\n\nA retired high school history teacher, Kershey is teaching a course on the Supreme Court at Immaculata University in Malvern, a suburb of Philadelphia. Those court cases were fresh in his mind as he sipped tea and ate pancakes at an IHOP on a recent afternoon. He objects to Trump\u2019s recent threat to unilaterally suspend the constitutional protection of birthright citizenship as a way to control undocumented immigration.\n\nYet for all his antipathy toward the president, the strength of the economy is at least giving Kershey pause: \u201cI\u2019ll probably vote Democratic, but I\u2019m not sure yet.\u201d\n\nWorkers have been increasingly benefiting from the economy\u2019s strength. Average pay growth for over the past 12 months has reached 3.1 percent, its best year-over-year increase since 2009, the government said Friday. Those gains have been concentrated among affluent Americans, though higher minimum wages have also helped raise the pay of many lower-income workers.\n\nAmong people earning at least $100,000, 60 percent approve of how Trump has handled the economy, according to a survey by The Associated Press and NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. That is a relative advantage for a president whose tax cuts for corporations and individuals are credited with helping boost growth this year.\n\nJean Hoffman, a 53-year-old real estate agent in Chester County, is pondering the college costs ahead for her two teenage daughters. She said she thinks voting Republican might help extend the economy\u2019s hot streak.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to have two kids in college, and these are my earning years,\u201d she said. \u201cSo for me, the economy is the No. 1 priority.\u201d\n\nHoffman said she feels less concerned about Trump\u2019s confrontational style or habit of assailing critics.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like white noise at this point,\u201d she said.\n\nJudging by the economy, the status of the House appears too close to call, said Ray Fair, a Yale economist. Using inflation and growth data, Fair developed a model to forecast electoral outcomes, which in 2016 correctly showed that that presidential election favored Republicans.\n\nFor 2018, Fair\u2019s economy-based model is less favorable than most political surveys for Democratic prospects to win the House. But the gap isn\u2019t sufficient to draw a firm conclusion about what will happen Tuesday. Because the party out of power \u2014 Democrats, in this case \u2014 generally enjoys an advantage in midterms, growth would have to be even stronger to decisively help Republicans this year.\n\n\u201cThis time, the real uncertainty is turnout,\u201d Fair said. \u201cYou can\u2019t say anything with much confidence about who is going be on which side of 50 percent.\u201d\n\nTo drive turnout, Pat Proprik, chair of the Bucks County Republicans, has been speaking to groups of voters nightly and knocking on doors. She said people in wealthier parts of the county tend to highlight the economy in explaining their intention to back Trump. Those in more modest areas tend to stress non-economic issues, at least at first.\n\n\u201cEconomics isn\u2019t the first thing out of their mouth,\u201d Proprik said. \u201cBut when you bring it up, they jump on it.\u201d\n\nAt 83, Dick Calef is a lifelong Republican. He attributes the economic gains in suburban Philadelphia to longer-term factors beyond Trump\u2019s policies, like the growth of internet and health care companies. Calef is still unsure how he\u2019ll vote.\n\n\u201cI find myself voting to keep a balance in the government,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m kind of fed up with the political environment.\u201d\n\nJerry McNeff intends to split his ballot between the parties in Pennsylvania\u2019s House, Senate and gubernatorial races.\n\n\u201cTrump had the right philosophy regarding the economy,\u201d said McNeff, 72. \u201cTaxes needed to be overhauled. Regulations had become obstructive to industry.\u201d\n\nBut as he has aged, McNeff said, the economy has mattered less to him. He thinks more about his five grandchildren. Every report of a mass shooting at a school makes him wonder about what could happen to them. And it stuns him that the federal government has done little to prevent future shootings, like seriously considering a bill to expand background checks.\n\n\u201cIf you say what is the No. 1 thing that keeps you up at night, that is it.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "BOSTON (AP) \u2014 Candidates for a slew of statewide offices are going to be crisscrossing Massachusetts in a final push for votes.\n\nRepublican U.S. Senate candidate Geoff Diehl will be joining supporters at rallies planned Saturday in Fitchburg and Worcester.\n\nIncumbent Democratic U.S. Sen.

(Thom Bridge/Independent Record via AP)\n\nAUGUSTA, Mont. (AP) \u2014 Falls Creek certainly lives up to its name.\n\nThe hallmark of the stream-carved valley sits hidden in its steep bottom, the creek hitting the edge and dropping a few stories into the pool below. On a recent day, area ranchers Dan and Wyatt Barrett stood on the edge of the canyon, listening to the dull thunder of the falls and looking up the valley jutting north from the Dearborn River.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to get this opened up,\u201d Dan Barrett told the Independent Record .\n\nThe Barretts were joined on their property southwest of Augusta on Oct. 19 by Mike Mueller with the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation, U.S. Forest Service District Ranger Michael Munoz and Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks Game Warden Bryan Golie. The Barretts own more than 440 acres between the county road and national forest boundary. But under a deal recently reached, and pending fundraising, the property could become the newest piece of the Helena-Lewis and Clark National Forest and open up access to about 26,000 acres (40 square miles) of public land.\n\n\u201cWith the big picture this really sews up what we want all the way to Highway 200,\u201d Golie said. \u201cIn 25 years as a game warden, I\u2019ve never seen an opportunity that will provide so much for the public.\u201d\n\nThe project is a national priority for the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation.\n\n\u201cI would echo that with my 30 years of experience, I mean you don\u2019t even see things like this in national parks,\u201d Mueller said. \u201cAnd to have a willing landowner, and I don\u2019t always get to say this, it really doesn\u2019t get any bigger and better than this for RMEF.\u201d\n\nFalls Creek has a long and at times tragic history of clashes over access. While the Barretts\u2019 property has remained closed for years due to trespass and liability concerns, an access dispute in a subdivision across the creek turned deadly in 2013 when Joseph Campbell shot and killed neighbor Timothy Newman. Campbell would eventually plead no contest in 2016 to negligent homicide.\n\nThe Barrett family homesteaded their property more than a century ago and continue to trail cattle across it to Forest Service grazing leases. After some \u201ctough negotiations,\u201d Dan Barrett decided he was comfortable with waiting out the public process and likely seeing a lower return on the property.\n\n\u201cA lot of people were upset when access was shut off and I didn\u2019t want to see it subdivided, or another disaster over access,\u201d Dan Barrett said. \u201cThey\u2019re really in a position to handle the public,\u201d he said of the Forest Service and FWP.\n\nThe Barretts agreed to the appraised sale price of about $2.4 million. The Elk Foundation has until 2020 to raise the money, and once purchased, convey the property to the Forest Service.\n\n\u201cThis is a great opportunity with a nonprofit taking the lead, but what\u2019s also great is we\u2019re really in control of the future here. The faster they get the money, the faster we can open the door,\u201d Golie said.\n\nRMEF has raised about $500,000 to date from major donors. The organization will continue to pursue large and small private donations and is pursuing up to $2 million in Lewis and Clark County Open Space Bond.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in Lewis and Clark County and we really feel like the citizens of Lewis and Clark County will be some of the biggest beneficiaries of this project,\u201d Mueller said.\n\nConnie Cole chairs the Citizens Advisory Committee on Open Lands, which makes recommendations to the county commission on potential open space projects. RMEF submitted an initial proposal to the committee along with a site visit, and will go back before the committee with a second level proposal on Nov. 7. The county commission makes final approval of projects and decides funding levels.\n\n\u201cThe open space bond doesn\u2019t require public access as part of our criteria, but because it does have public access it\u2019s even more of a gem,\u201d Cole said. \u201cI think on this one it\u2019s one of those particular places in Montana that really need to be protected for the public in perpetuity.\u201d\n\nMueller also hopes to tap funding from the federal Land and Water Conservation Fund; however, the fund recently expired and faces an uncertain reauthorization. Even without those dollars, Mueller says he feels confident about meeting contractual deadlines.\n\nMunoz admires the property for both its ecological beauty as well as potential for recreation. Falls Creek both starts and ends on public ground, it has no water rights to be diverted, and the falls make a natural barrier that lends itself to restoration of native cutthroat trout.\n\n\u201cIt gets to the Dearborn River, so it has both boating access and forest access,\u201d he said.\n\nThe layout has everything necessary for development into a trailhead, campground and fishing access site. Under the existing travel management plan, public access would be managed as nonmotorized, and hikers, mountain bikers and horseback riders to access trail systems all the way to and over the Continental Divide, Munoz said.\n\nWhen it comes to elk, Golie believes the access could affect hunting as far away as Lincoln. The district currently holds a herd of 1,000 \u2014 about 400 over population objectives \u2014 but elk have shifted their migratory patterns over the years.

The bear was safely rescued by Kalispell Police, Flahtead County Sheriff's Office Animal Control, Kalispell Fire, and Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks. At least seven calls came into the the 911 Call Center with reports of the bear in the Three Mile Drive area and in the community garden. (Brenda Ahearn/The Daily Inter Lake via AP)\n\nKALISPELL, Mont. (AP) \u2014 Erik Wenum is known as the \u201cbear guy,\u201d and it\u2019s an apt moniker, given the fact that he\u2019s handled nearly 5,000 bears during his tenure with Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks.\n\nHe\u2019s the bear and mountain lion specialist for the state agency, but truth is, there just isn\u2019t enough space on his business card to provide a simplified description of the work he does.\n\nWenum, 56, has been working with large mammals for more than 30 years, including 28 with Fish, Wildlife and Parks. He earned his degree at Colorado State and studied deer in that state before moving to Montana to get his master\u2019s degree at Montana State University. He began working for Fish, Wildlife and Parks in its South Fork grizzly research project before becoming its bear and mountain lion specialist.\n\nMost of his experiences have been with bears, mountain lions and people, but he also has handled scores of incidents involving deer, elk, moose and wolves.\n\nHe has trapped and relocated black and grizzly bears, re-denned orphaned bear cubs, euthanized bears that were deemed a threat to people, removed baling twine from the antlers of a white-tailed deer, removed a volleyball net from the antlers of a young bull moose at Bitterroot Lake and relocated a moose that had taken up residence at the Whitefish Lake Golf Course.\n\nFWP Region 1 Supervisor Jim Williams has high praise for Wenum.\n\n\u201cErik is probably one of the best biologists working under pressure with local, county, state and federal agencies in terms of wildlife and human conflicts,\u201d Williams said. \u201cHe\u2019s calm, cool and collected. He is uniquely qualified for his position.\u201d\n\nWilliams said when Wenum arrived, mountain lion conflicts were rapidly increasing in the Flathead Valley.\n\n\u201cOne of our biologists, Shawn Riley, created the zone management program for lions and Erik was front and center in dealing with those conflicts,\u201d Williams said. \u201cErik worked with a lot of lions and he was probably the first in the country to work on those conflicts, teaching urban and rural communities to live with mountain lions.\n\n\u201cOther countries in South America and states here in the U.S. have modeled their lion programs after what Erik has done here,\u201d Williams added.\n\n\u201cThe big down side for him is that he is the only conflict specialist for the region, so he has to prioritize the calls he receives \u2014 which are many \u2014 and we have to make sure he gets a day off now and then.\u201d\n\nWenum also has had to investigate fatal bear maulings, including one of a close friend, FWP Game Warden Brad Treat, that occurred about two years ago on the Green Gate Trail network between Coram and West Glacier, when Treat collided with a grizzly while mountain biking.\n\n\u201cThat is the unfortunate side of the job, but those are the risks and hazards you have to deal with at times,\u201d he said.\n\nFor Wenum, the list of animals he has worked with seems endless.\n\n\u201cI have trapped and handled every species of large mammal in North America with the exception of polar bear, musk ox and caribou, but they are on my bucket list,\u201d Wenum told the Daily Inter Lake.\n\nOne moose encounter, he recalled, became a little sloppy when it vomited all over him. Wenum had responded to a Columbia Falls residence because a cow with a calf refused to allow a man to leave his home.\n\n\u201cShe and the calf had taken up residence in his yard and whenever he\u2019d try to leave to go to work, she\u2019d charge right up to the deck, so he was pretty scared to go to work,\u201d Wenum said.\n\nWhen he responded to the home, he didn\u2019t initially see either moose, but after the man safely made his way to his vehicle, Wenum found the cow and calf behind the home. He then utilized an innovative approach to try and get them to leave.\n\n\u201cI hit her with a snowball and she didn\u2019t react, so I beaned the calf. When it made a noise, the cow charged me,\u201d Wenum said.\n\nHe ducked behind a tree, but she curled her head around it and threw up all over his face and chest.\n\n\u201cI walked back to my truck wiping stuff off my face and clothes,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was really pleasant,\u201d he said with a sarcastic chuckle.\n\nWenum also has developed an international reputation as one of the leading authorities on bears.\n\nAs a member of the Wildlife Human Attack Response Team, Wenum helps lead investigations that typically involve bears and people.\n\nHe and FWP Regional Investigator Brian Sommers have traveled to several states and Canadian provinces at the requests of state fish-and-game agencies, teaching their personnel how to develop their teams and protocols and how to conduct these types of investigations. They also consult with states on mauling incidents.\n\nBut for all of his experiences and credentials, Wenum\u2019s biggest frustrations involve the interactions with wildlife and people.\n\n\u201cWe have a very large bear population here in Northwest Montana,\u201d Wenum stressed. \u201cThere are up to 1,200 grizzlies and the black bear population has always been robust. There is great habitat for them here, but the human population has rapidly expanded here in the last 20 years and the turnover of people is very high. So it seems like we are always educating people about how to limit wildlife encounters.\u201d\n\nWenum\u2019s work with bears has been the most captivating for him.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve learned a great deal about bears and most of the attacks or incidents, we know what triggers them,\u201d Wenum said. \u201cWhether it\u2019s a surprise encounter or in defense of a cub or food, we understand why they happen.\n\n\u201cBut every so often, we hear about one that just doesn\u2019t add up. We had one where a male grizzly circled a group of people in Glacier (National Park) and then charged into it and knocked one guy down before it retreated.\n\n\u201cThe people hadn\u2019t done anything to provoke it, but there was no obvious reason why it did what it did and why it homed in on the one guy,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI always said I\u2019d like to sit down and buy a bear a beer to get a better understanding of what makes them tick,\u201d he added.\n\nHe also said more people raising chickens in their backyards has increased the number of bear calls.\n\n\u201cWe really can\u2019t be surprised with the conflicts with so many food sources available to predators,\u201d Wenum said. \u201cThe population has grown dramatically and more people are living in areas where bears have traditionally been and you add chickens, gardens, pet food that isn\u2019t secured, there are going to be conflicts.\u201d\n\nConflicts have kept Wenum and others with Fish, Wildlife and Parks busy giving programs to school students and community groups.\n\n\u201cWe push the information and education side pretty hard so people know what\u2019s going on and how they deal with it best,\u201d Wenum said. \u201cPeople are starting to get a better idea of what is living in and around their homes because so many are putting up game cameras.\u201d\n\nDespite some of the frustrations of the job, Wenum said his work is extremely satisfying.\n\n\u201cI spend about 90 percent of my time working outside, I have a lot of freedom in my work and I get to work with a phenomenal group of people that are single-minded in the goals of resource management and protection,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Daily Inter Lake, http://www.dailyinterlake.com", "GEDDES, N.Y.

(AP) \u2014 A brooding military veteran and former teacher appeared to have made videos in which he railed at women and blacks, years before he fatally shot two women at a Florida yoga studio, wounded five other people and then killed himself.\n\nThe Friday evening shooting at a busy upscale shopping plaza jolted the state capital and police said they were still searching for a motive that led to the deaths of a Florida State University student and a well-known local doctor who was a member of the school faculty.\n\nBut details about 40-year-old Scott Paul Beierle began to emerge in the hours after, including that he had once been banned from FSU\u2019s campus and had been arrested twice for grabbing women even though the charges were ultimately dropped.\n\nBeierle, who had moved to the central Florida town of Deltona after getting a graduate degree from FSU, appeared to post a series of videos on YouTube in 2014 where he called women \u201cwhores\u201d if they dated black men, said many black women were \u201cdisgusting\u201d and described himself as a misogynist.\n\nA Tallahassee police spokesman would not confirm or deny the videos were Beierle\u2019s. However, the man speaking in the videos looks like Beierle and biographical details mentioned in the videos match known facts about Beierle, including details about his military service. Also, the poster\u2019s YouTube username included the word \u201cScott,\u201d Beierle\u2019s first name. The existence of the videos was first reported by BuzzFeed.\n\nIn one video, the man said promiscuous women deserved to be crucified and he suggested putting up land mines to keep people from crossing into the U.S. from Mexico.\n\nIn another video, the man who appeared to be Beierle likened his adolescent self to Elliot Rodger, a 22-year-old who killed six students and wounded more than a dozen others near the University of California, Santa Barbara, before killing himself in 2014. Rodger was a self-identified \u201cincel,\u201d short for \u201cinvoluntary celibate.\u201d\n\nTallahassee police say Beierle shot six people and pistol-whipped another after walking into the yoga studio that sits on the second floor of a shopping center located near the city\u2019s fashionable midtown neighborhoods. Tallahassee Police Chief Michael DeLeo said some in the studio showed courage by trying to stop him.\n\nWitnesses at the shopping center described how people who had been in the studio ran away, seeking shelter in nearby bars and restaurants as shots rang out.\n\nPolice responded within a few minutes, but by then Beirele had fatally shot himself, leaving police to search for a motive and a community to wonder what prompted the violence.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a place that brings me joy and peace, and I think it\u2019s ruined,\u201d said Katie Bohnett, an instructor at the yoga studio who skipped her normal Friday practice to meet a friend for dinner. \u201cThis monster ruined it.\u201d\n\nPolice said Beierle acted alone but they were still looking into what prompted the shooting. He was originally from New York, had served in the military and once was a teacher in Maryland. After his military service, he wound up attending FSU.\n\nKristi Malone, who had a graduate class with Beierle, said in a Facebook message that she did not interact with him outside of the classroom because of \u201chis odd leering, inappropriate comments and general demeanor.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know that myself and several of my female colleagues made a point to never be alone with him even at school because of his odd behavior,\u201d Malone said.\n\nMike Orgo, who was friends with Beierle on Facebook, said he met him back in 2011 at comedy night open microphone sessions held at a Tallahassee restaurant. He said that he did not know him well but said he \u201cdefinitely seemed angry and on edge.\u201d\n\nWitnesses told police that Beierle posed as a customer to gain entrance to the studio, then started shooting without warning. Police have not yet said what kind of gun he used. Bohnett said she did not recognize Beierle.\n\nThe two slain Friday were a student and faculty member at Florida State University, according to university officials. The department identified them as Dr. Nancy Van Vessem, 61, and Maura Binkley, 21. Binkley was a student from Atlanta who was due to graduate in May. Police said two other victims were in stable condition, and three had been released from the hospital.\n\nVan Vessem was an internist who also served as chief medical director for Capital Health Plan, the area\u2019s leading health maintenance organization.\n\nCourt records show that Beierle was charged by police with battery in 2016 after he slapped and grabbed a woman\u2019s buttocks at an apartment complex pool. Records show that the charges were eventually dismissed after Beierle followed the conditions of a deferred prosecution agreement.\n\nBeierle was also charged with battery in 2012 for grabbing women\u2019s buttocks in a university campus dining hall. A FSU police report shows that Beierle told police he may have accidentally bumped into someone, but denied grabbing anyone.\n\nIn 2014, Beierle was charged with trespassing at FSU. He had been seen following an FSU volleyball coach near the campus gym and was told that he was banned from campus.
