Sarkisian faces one of his toughest challenges of the season, trying to find a way for his suspect rushing attack to gain ground against Washington's stout front. (Curtis Compton/Atlanta Journal-Constitution via AP, File)\n\nFLOWERY BRANCH, Ga. (AP) \u2014 Falcons offensive coordinator Steve Sarkisian is preparing for what could be his toughest challenge this season.\n\nIf he thought it was tough scoring on goal-to-go in the season-opening loss at Philadelphia, Sarkisian knows this week might be more difficult as Atlanta tries to avoid becoming a one-dimensional passing attack at Washington.\n\nQuarterback Matt Ryan needs a play-action threat to keep the Redskins (5-2) from locking down all afternoon on his receivers, so the Falcons (3-4) must find a way to establish the ground game against a tough defensive front.\n\nThe outlook does not look promising. The Falcons rank 30th in yards rushing. The Redskins rank second in defending the run.\n\nDevonta Freeman, Atlanta\u2019s top running back, was lost to groin surgery earlier this month. Starting guards Andy Levitre and Brandon Fusco are out for the season with injuries.\n\n\u201cEach game takes on its own personality in essence,\u201d Sarkisian said Thursday. \u201cSo it is beneficial when you can hang with it and stick with it, but there are times when we\u2019ve got to do what is best for us right now. You just try to figure it out as it goes, and it\u2019s all part of making those decisions at those moments when they come and try to do what\u2019s best for the team.\u201d\n\nSarkisian insists he won\u2019t press if Atlanta struggles to run the ball early in the game. He plans to keep trying to mix it in on later drives.\n\nThe Falcons have one of the NFL\u2019s premier passing games with Ryan throwing to Julio Jones, Calvin Ridley, Mohamed Sanu and Austin Hooper, so the team will stick with what it does best.\n\n\u201cSometimes to run the football you have to establish it at times and then finally something does pop, but there\u2019s other times that this drive is so important right now, let\u2019s do what is best for us at this moment right now,\u201d Sarkisian said. \u201cAnd that may be to run it more and that may be throw it more.\u201d\n\nThe Redskins are loaded up front. Ends Matt Ioannidis and Jonathan Allen and linebacker Ryan Kerrigan have combined for 14 sacks and 22 quarterback hits. Nose tackle Da\u2019Ron Payne figures to make it a long day for guards Wes Schweitzer and Ben Garland.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of twists and stunts and games that they do up front that make it challenging on your guys up front,\u201d Sarkisian said. \u201cIt\u2019s not always just the one-on-one rush. They start pairing two guys, three guys together, sometimes even all four of them together, so they really do it cohesively. The challenge for us is to make sure we\u2019re protecting cohesively.\u201d\n\nSarkisian likes how third-year veteran Tevin Coleman and Ito Smith have combined to fill Freeman\u2019s spot. He thinks that Schweitzer has done a respectable job in five games for Levitre, and Garland, who started the final five games last season, has plenty of experience as he prepares to take over for Fusco.\n\nSarkisian was pleased with how Coleman responded on a third-and-1 run early in the fourth quarter of Atlanta\u2019s previous game, a narrow win over the New York Giants. Running off right tackle, Coleman sprinted for a 30-yard touchdown that\u2019s one of the few rushing highlights for Atlanta this season.\n\n\u201cThat type of explosiveness we know is there in our run game,\u201d Sarkisian said. \u201cWe\u2019ve just to keep hunting and pecking until it comes.\u201d\n\nJones sees no reason to worry. He believes Atlanta will find ways to score regardless.\n\n\u201cThe Redskins haven\u2019t played the 2018 Atlanta Falcons, so we\u2019re going in there and we\u2019re going to try to run the ball,\u201d Jones said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to run. We\u2019re going to pass. They\u2019ve got to stop us on Sunday.\u201d\n\nNotes: Sanu (hip) was held out of practice a day after being a limited participant. ... CB Robert Alford (ankle) missed practice for the second straight day. Coach Dan Quinn said he was injured against the Giants but didn\u2019t want to come out. Isaiah Oliver will start if Alford can\u2019t play. ... PK Matt Bryant did not participate, and it appears likely that Giorgio Tavecchio will replace him for the second straight game.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "HATTIESBURG, Miss.

The teams meet again this week. (AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill, File)\n\nNEW ORLEANS (AP) \u2014 Saints coach Sean Payton has seen plenty of road hazards in the nearly 13 years he\u2019s lived in New Orleans, a city where streets routinely crack and buckle atop the spongy landscape of drained swamp and marsh.\n\nThat could explain the metaphor at the forefront of Payton\u2019s consciousness when he described how he sees Sunday\u2019s clash with the unbeaten Los Angeles Rams. Although the matchup between the Rams (8-0) and surging Saints (6-1) has the ingredients of a potential NFC title game preview, Payton suggested that he\u2019s better served by approaching the game in much the same way he drives around his adoptive home town.\n\n\u201cYou see a team coming in here unbeaten, and you know they are in the NFC, and you recognize the significance of the game,\u201d Payton said. \u201cBut I look at it more from a team perspective. And I look at it more from, \u2018Man, this is the next challenge.\u2019\n\n\u201cSo we just stare, in this city, at the pothole in front of us. That\u2019s the one we got to worry about. Not the ones that are there coming up beyond that,\u201d Payton continued. \u201cAnd this one sits square in the middle of the street.\u201d\n\nRams coach Sean McVay should take the pothole comparison as a compliment. It\u2019s clear the 54-year-old Payton admires what the Rams\u2019 32-year-old, similarly offensive-minded head coach has accomplished in just his first season-and-a-half as a head coach.\n\n\u201cI am a huge fan of Sean\u2019s and I have gotten to know him and have a ton of respect for what he has done going on his second year,\u201d Payton said of McVay, adding that he \u201cabsolutely\u201d makes a point of watching the Rams throughout the season.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re a must-watch team,\u201d Payton said.\n\nThe admiration is mutual when McVay discusses Payton\u2019s offense.\n\n\u201cI look at their tape every week, see what they\u2019re doing,\u201d McVay said. \u201cI also appreciate the aggressive nature that coach Payton comes after people.\n\n\u201cThat mindset of never being afraid to fail and always attacking is something that we try to do,\u201d McVay added. \u201cIt demonstrates a confidence and belief in your players.\u201d\n\nSome other story lines surrounding the Rams-Saints showdown, the winner of which will have the inside track to the No. 1 playoff seeding in the conference:\n\nCOACH-QB COMBOS\n\nThe Saints have been among the NFL leaders in offense since Payton arrived in New Orleans and recruited then-free agent Drew Brees to join him in 2006.\n\nCurrently, the Saints rank eighth in yards per game (389.9) and second in points per game (33.4). The Rams offense, with 2016 top overall draft choice Jared Goff under center, rank second in yards (442.6) and third in scoring (33).\n\nEach team\u2019s head coach-QB tandem mirror one another in that Payton and McVay both call offensive plays, putting a premium on their communication and relationship with their quarterbacks. The difference is that Payton and the 39-year-old Brees have been together far longer, and Brees has set prestigious NFL passing records .\n\n\u201cThose guys are two of the best ever to do it together,\u201d the 24-year-old Goff said. \u201cMe and Sean (McVay) have a great relationship, and hopefully it\u2019ll continue to grow.\u201d\n\nDEFENSIVE DISPARITY\n\nThe Rams already had the league\u2019s eighth-ranked defense before the addition of edge pass-rusher Dante Fowler at Tuesday\u2019s NFL trade deadline. In seven games with Jacksonville this season, Fowler\u2019s highlights included two sacks and a forced fumble. It\u2019s unclear how much he\u2019ll play right away, but is expected to rotate into the game on some passing downs.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really know how they\u2019re going to use him yet, but I watched some film on him,\u201d Saints right tackle Ryan Ramczyk said. \u201cHe\u2019s a good athlete, a good player, so I\u2019ll be prepared.\u201d\n\nThe Saints rank 23rd in total defense \u2014 28th against the pass \u2014 but have been opportunistic. Defensive back P.J. Williams\u2019 past outing in Minnesota was a case in point. He was beaten several times on Minnesota receptions, but also helped force a fumble that resulted in one TD and ran back an interception for a score.\n\nFULL KUPP\n\nThe Rams\u2019 biggest lineup addition this week might not be Fowler: They expect to have receiver Cooper Kupp back in uniform after a two-game absence with a knee injury.\n\nThe second-year target\u2019s presence would be a boon for Goff, who found Kupp for a team-leading 869 yards receiving last season.\n\nGOFF\u2019S RETURN\n\nGoff made his second career start at the Superdome in 2016. While those woebegone Rams were routed 49-21 , Goff emerged with the highest passer rating in any game of his rookie season, along with his first three NFL touchdown passes.\n\n\u201cIt maybe gave me some confidence knowing that being in a hostile environment like that and being able to make plays was something that I saw myself do and was able to kind of grow from that experience,\u201d Goff said.\n\nNow a smooth leader of McVay\u2019s well-oiled offensive machine, Goff gets his chance to show the Superdome faithful what he has learned since.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Greg Beacham in Thousand Oaks, California, contributed.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "FORT PIERRE, S.D.

The Vikings host the Detroit Lions on Sunday, Nov. 4. (AP Photo/Bruce Kluckhohn, File)\n\nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 When Kirk Cousins and his family moved from Illinois to Michigan, his allegiance to the Bears was well-established.\n\nLeaving Chicagoland, Cousins wondered aloud to his dad whether they\u2019d be required to become fans of the Lions and the other Detroit-area teams.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018Kirk, you can take the boy out of Chicago. You can\u2019t take Chicago out of the boy,\u2019\u201d Cousins recalled this week.\n\nLoyal to the Bears they remained, but inside Michigan\u2019s borders the Lions always received top TV billing. So Cousins moved through his teenage years and on to college at Michigan State with more than adequate coverage of the Lions, a clear familiarity that has only deepened now that Cousins has joined a different team in the NFC North in Minnesota.\n\nThe Vikings (4-3-1) will host the Lions (3-4) on Sunday, the first time Cousins, who\u2019s second in the NFL with 2,521 passing yards, will face his home state\u2019s squad as a division rival.\n\n\u201cI think with every game we play, I can point to something about the team or an opponent on the team or a coach or whatever it might be that makes you feel like you\u2019re living a dream,\u201d Cousins said, \u201cand certainly going against the Detroit Lions is no different being that I grew up in that state.\u201d\n\nWith the Bears (4-3) and Green Bay Packers (3-3-1) bunched in, too, this game will be the first of several in the second half of the season to shape a tight race.\n\n\u201cDivision games count for two,\u201d Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford said. \u201cYou get the win, and they get the loss. They\u2019re big games, and the more you can go and win those, whether on the road or at your place, the better. We have a big stretch of them coming up.\u201d\n\nHere are some other key angles to follow with the game:\n\nMATCHING MEGATRON\n\nAdam Thielen leads the NFL with 74 receptions and 925 yards for the Vikings. With at least 100 yards in each of the first eight games, Thielen has tied Lions legend Calvin Johnson for the longest streak in league history. Johnson\u2019s run was in 2012, when he set the all-time NFL record with 1,964 yards.\n\nAs a football-loving kid living in Minnesota, Thielen naturally tried to emulate Cris Carter and Randy Moss. But Johnson was another star wide receiver he closely watched. Johnson, who retired after the 2015 season, wore No. 21 in college at Georgia Tech. So did Thielen at Detroit Lakes High School, not coincidentally.\n\n\u201cHe could block, he could run short routes, he could run deep routes, and he\u2019d catch everything,\u201d Thielen said. \u201cWhen people were draped all over him, he\u2019d still make the plays. I just remember a lot of games where Stafford would just throw the ball up, and there\u2019d be three guys on him and he\u2019d still come down with the ball.\u201d\n\nWith Stefon Diggs another dangerous option for Cousins, limiting Thielen has been even more of a challenge for opponents.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have a hard time trying to handle him,\u201d coach Matt Patricia said. \u201cHe runs really good routes. He has great change of direction. He can get vertically very quick. He understands zone coverage \u2014 he can sit down and find the open space \u2014 and he has great hands. So definitely will be a big issue for us.\u201d\n\nGOLDEN\u2019S GONE\n\nThough Johnson caused the Vikings secondary plenty of problems over his nine years in the league, Golden Tate did his share of damage, too.\n\nIn the first four wins by the Lions over the Vikings since Zimmer was hired in 2014, twice in his first year and twice in 2016, Tate totaled 228 yards and two touchdowns on 30 catches while being targeted 38 times. That included his game-winning somersault into the end zone in overtime in Minnesota in 2016, after Vikings standouts Xavier Rhodes and Harrison Smith missed their attempts to tackle him.\n\nLast season, the Vikings limited Tate to just seven receptions for 36 yards over their two matchups. Now he\u2019s gone, having been traded to Philadelphia .\n\n\u201cI was surprised about that. He was their main guy on third downs. He was great with yards after the catch,\u201d Rhodes said, adding: \u201cIt was one of those situations where you were like, \u2018Oh, let me check MY phone.\u2019\u201d\n\nGRIFFEN GETTING GOING\n\nVikings defensive end Everson Griffen, who has 7\u00bd sacks in eight games against the Lions since becoming a starter in 2014, made his season debut last week after missing five games to seek mental health treatment. Griffen played 37 of 53 snaps against New Orleans.\n\n\u201cMy No. 1 goal is just to keep on going out there and knocking the rust off more and more each day, but I\u2019m feeling good,\u201d Griffen said.\n\nGAME ON THE GROUND\n\nAfter finishing last, third-to-last and last in the NFL in rushing over the previous three years, the Lions have revived their long-languishing ground game with the arrival of rookie Kerryon Johnson. With an average of nearly 110 yards per game, they\u2019re 16th in the league this week.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s mostly what the offensive line\u2019s doing. No matter how good a running back is, he needs the offensive line, period,\u201d Vikings defensive tackle Sheldon Richardson said. \u201cAin\u2019t too many Barry Sanders in the league.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "Los Angeles Dodger general manager Farhan Zaidi talks as President of Baseball Operations Andrew Friedman, left, during a press conference, on Thursday, Nov. 1, 2018, at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles (Scott Varley/The Orange County Register via AP)\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 The Dodgers are in ongoing negotiations with ace Clayton Kershaw, and they still need to resolve the future of manager Dave Roberts, too.\n\nAccording to president of baseball operations Andrew Friedman, the talks with Kershaw\u2019s camp are \u201congoingly pleasant.\u201d\n\nThe three-time NL Cy Young Award winner and the team agreed to extend the deadline on Kershaw\u2019s opt-out decision by 40 hours until 1 p.m. PDT Friday.\n\nKershaw can opt out of the last two years and $65 million of his contract to become a free agent for the first time in an 11-year big league career spent entirely with the Dodgers.\n\nIf he chooses free agency, Kershaw could negotiate with any team, including the Dodgers.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s made as much of an impact as you can on an organization in terms of the success we\u2019ve had,\u201d Friedman said Thursday. \u201cNot just on the field but from a culture standpoint in terms of bringing up young pitchers and emulating the work ethic, the drive.\u201d\n\nKershaw signed a $215 million, seven-year contract in January 2014 that calls for salaries of $32 million next year and $33 million in 2020. He was 9-5 with a 2.73 ERA this season.\n\nThe Dodgers and Roberts discussed a contract extension going back to spring training without reaching a deal. Roberts has said he expects to be back next year.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t an issue at all to kind of table it and pick it up when we were done playing,\u201d Friedman said.\n\nBoth Friedman and general manager Farhan Zaidi expressed support for Roberts, who got booed during the World Series for some of his on-field decisions.\n\n\u201cWe both feel very strongly that those strategic decisions are the result of a process,\u201d Zaidi said. \u201cWe believe and we continue to have full confidence in his process. I also think when you start putting the microscope on little individual decisions it\u2019s also taking credit away from the other team. The Red Sox were a terrific team.\u201d\n\nZaidi said Roberts\u2019 coaching staff will be brought back next season.\n\nThe Dodgers dropped under the luxury tax threshold this year after paying nearly $150 million over the previous five seasons, although Friedman wouldn\u2019t say if Los Angeles plans to be under next year\u2019s $206 million threshold.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question that we have plenty of resources to win a World Series next year,\u201d he said. \u201cThe talent on hand and the flexibility to do that I think is definitely there.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week, MLB.com reported rival San Francisco was interested in talking to Zaidi about a job in its baseball operations department. Zaidi previously spent a decade working in Oakland\u2019s front office before joining the Dodgers four years ago.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to comment on that,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now my focus is on the Dodgers until you guys tell me otherwise.\u201d\n\nThe team\u2019s top free agents are:\n\n\u2014 Manny Machado. The shortstop was acquired from Baltimore in July and played outstanding defense. But he hit .182 in the World Series and drew ire for his admitted lack of hustle and overly aggressive base-running that earned him a $10,000 fine from Major League Baseball.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a great look,\u201d Friedman said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it got to the fact that he didn\u2019t care. I think he did care and his teammates really liked him and respected him.\u201d\n\nCorey Seager continues recovering from Tommy John and hip surgeries, and the Dodgers expect him back at short in time for opening day.\n\n\u2014 Hyun-Jin Ryu. The 31-year-old South Korean pitcher has spent his entire five-year MLB career with the Dodgers. The left-hander was 7-3 with a 1.97 ERA in 15 regular-season starts and spent time on the disabled list with a groin injury. He stumbled in the NL Championship Series and World Series.\n\n\u2014 Yasmani Grandal. The catcher went 4 for 29 with 15 strikeouts in the postseason. He struggled defensively in the NLCS and was replaced by Austin Barnes.\n\nThe remaining free agents are relievers John Axford, Daniel Hudson and Ryan Madson, and second baseman Brian Dozier.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure there will be some turnover,\u201d Friedman said. \u201cHow much it\u2019s tough to say right now.\u201d\n\nThe Dodgers got one bit of business completed Thursday night, agreeing to terms with David Freese on a one-year contract after the club option of $6 million was declined.\n\nThe 35-year-old infielder joined the team in August after a trade from Pittsburgh.\n\nFreese was 8 for 22 with two home runs, six RBIs and a walk in 14 postseason games while platooning at first base. He hit .385 in 19 regular-season games with Los Angeles.\n\nWith Chase Utley having just retired, Freese could fill his veteran leadership role in the clubhouse.\n\nAlso Thursday, the Dodgers acquired infielder Justin Yurchak from the Chicago White Sox for left-handed pitcher Manny Banuelos.\n\n___\n\nMore AP baseball coverage: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas (AP) \u2014 The Coast Guard says it hoisted two men aboard one of its helicopters after the men\u2019s sailing vessel was dismasted in a storm and run aground on Matagorda Island.\n\nThe incident happened Wednesday evening as a severe storm blew up as the men were sailing their 37-foot vessel in a Houston-to-Port Aransas regatta.

I hope so,\u201d he said. \u201cI know there could be some bad stuff on there.\u201d\n\nNagy generated rave reviews, with the series of clips shedding further light on how the first-year coach has spurred second-year quarterback Mitchell Trubisky\u2019s development as the Bears travel to play the Buffalo Bills on Sunday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to challenge you right now these two quarters for greatness,\u201d Nagy told Trubisky on the sideline at halftime. \u201cYou take this thing over right now.\u201d\n\nTrubisky responded by overseeing three consecutive scoring drives in which the Bears turned a 7-3 lead into a 24-10 win.\n\nHe called the pep-talk inspiring.\n\n\u201cWhen he says that, I think it just makes us more goal-oriented,\u201d Trubisky said. \u201cI think it really just honed me in, made me focus more.\u201d\n\nTrubisky has been on a roll.\n\nHis 1,814 yards passing in seven games are 379 yards shy of his total in 12 games last year. He has been especially sharp the past four games with 1,233 yards passing and 13 touchdowns \u2014 the most over that span for Chicago since Sid Luckman in 1947.\n\nCoupled with an opportunistic defense, which ranks second in the NFL with 17 takeaways, the Bears (4-3) are off to their best start in five years.\n\nThe Bills (2-6), by comparison, are off to their worst start since 2010, and coach Sean McDermott has had difficulty coaxing much out of a patchwork offense.\n\nThey haven\u2019t scored a touchdown in two games, and managed just 87 points all season.\n\nAnd now Buffalo faces the prospect of starting turnover-prone Nathan Peterman on Sunday, with rookie Josh Allen (sprained throwing elbow) ruled out for a third consecutive week, and Derek Anderson dealing with concussion-related issues.\n\nThis would mark Peterman\u2019s second turn at starting this season, and after he went 5 of 18 for 24 yards and two interceptions through two-plus quarters of a 47-3 season-opening loss at Baltimore.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thankful for all the opportunities I\u2019ve been through, all the lessons I\u2019ve learned, and ready to be better from them,\u201d said Peterman, who has 10 interceptions in 84 career passing attempts, including a brief playoff appearance. \u201cI\u2019m going to go out there and do my best to get us a win.\u201d\n\nPRYOR COMMITMENT\n\nReceiver Terrelle Pryor is in position to make his Bills debut five days since signing with Buffalo, and 10 days after being released by the New York Jets.\n\nAfter saying he felt \u201cunderused\u201d during his six-game stint in New York, ending with a groin injury, Pryor is confident he make an immediate impact in Buffalo.\n\n\u201cI expect high things from myself, and I expect high things from the offense,\u201d he said. \u201cJust because we lost some games doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t win or can\u2019t put things together.

Eric Kush or rookie James Daniels, who have split time at left guard, are candidates to fill the job. Another option is Bryan Witzmann, who signed three weeks ago.

(AP Photo/Fred Vuich, File)\n\nBALTIMORE (AP) \u2014 In each of the last two years, the Baltimore Ravens have been eliminated from playoff contention with late-season losses to the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nFor the first time since 2014, these AFC North rivals will wrap up the season series before December. That doesn\u2019t mean Sunday\u2019s game is any less important to the skidding Ravens (4-4).\n\n\u201cYou know you have eight games left, and 4-4 is not where you want to be, obviously,\u201d cornerback Jimmy Smith said. \u201cDoesn\u2019t mean your season is over, it just means that every game now is so much more critical.\u201d\n\nBaltimore is only one game behind the first-place Steelers (4-2-1), who have won three straight since losing to the Ravens on Sept. 30. But the last thing the Ravens need now is to drop under .500 with a third successive defeat.\n\n\u201cIf you do math, and you\u2019ve been through these playoff things, it gets sticky if you\u2019re 9-7,\u201d Smith said. \u201cIt gets sticky if you\u2019re 10-6, so you know that you really want to go in there and win 11 games, at least. Being 12-4 is really the goal.\u201d\n\nUnless the Ravens run the table, a highly unlikely occurrence, they\u2019re at least going to have to perform much better than they have lately to end a run of three consecutive seasons without a playoff berth. Coming off a 36-21 loss at Carolina, Baltimore can jump into contention with its first sweep of the Steelers since 2015.\n\n\u201cThe sky is not falling,\u201d safety Eric Weddle said. \u201cIt\u2019s great that we get to go against Pittsburgh, a divisional opponent, knowing we have to play at a high level.\u201d\n\nThe Steelers would love nothing more than to pad their lead in the AFC North, and at the same time make it that much tougher for the Ravens to reach the postseason.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big game for us. It\u2019s a division game. It\u2019s a road game. It\u2019s Baltimore. Pick one, or all of the above,\u201d Pittsburgh coach Mike Tomlin said. \u201cWe have respect for this rivalry and our participation in it, and we\u2019re preparing with that in mind.\u201d\n\nMore things to know about the Steelers-Ravens matchup:\n\nCRUISING CONNER\n\nThe Steelers are getting along just fine without wayward running back Le\u2019Veon Bell, thanks in large part to second-year back James Conner .\n\nConner is averaging 175.3 yards of total offense during Pittsburgh\u2019s winning streak, a surge that started after Conner carried the ball just three times in the second half against Baltimore.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just doing what I love to do,\u201d Conner said.\n\nCLOSE SHAVE\n\nRavens quarterback Joe Flacco showed up at practice this week without the beard he\u2019s worn for the first eight weeks of the season.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about cutting it about every night for two weeks,\u201d Flacco said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we\u2019ve been winning with it. So, we\u2019ve all got a little bit of superstition in us, I guess.\u201d\n\nPerhaps he should have cut it a week ago. Flacco had his worst game of the season against the Panthers, going 22 for 39 for 192 yards, with one TD pass and two interceptions.\n\nBROWN DELIVERS\n\nNo active player has more catches (94) and yards receiving (1,149) against the Ravens in the regular season than Steelers wideout Antonio Brown.\n\nCovering Brown will serve as a litmus test for Smith, who began the season serving a four-game suspension and hasn\u2019t quite gotten his A-game going yet.\n\n\u201cEvery game you\u2019re going to go against somebody\u2019s best,\u201d Smith said, \u201cbut when you go against one of the guys they name as top in the league, it\u2019s a chance to show what you\u2019ve got and kind of peg yourself for where you\u2019re at.\u201d\n\nSurprisingly, Brown has only four career TDs against the Ravens.\n\nBURNED BURNS\n\nTime may be running out for Pittsburgh cornerback Artie Burns. The former first-round pick is enduring an uneven season and was benched last week for missing a walkthrough\n\nBurns might have to play out of necessity if Coty Sensabaugh\u2019s toe injury continues to linger. Burns shrugged off his issues, but Tomlin offered a stern rebuke of the 23-year-old\u2019s tardiness.\n\n\u201cHe was late, and we wanted to be focused with the guys who were wired-in appropriately where they needed to be in the hours leading up to kickoff,\u201d Tomlin said. \u201cAnd so, he suffered the consequences of that.\u201d\n\nPittsburgh\u2019s secondary in general needs to play better than it did in the first meeting, when Flacco passed for 363 yards and two TDs.\n\nHELLO, NOVEMBER\n\nThe Ravens went 1-3 in October, but have cause for optimism because they\u2019re 30-12 in November since coach John Harbaugh took over in 2008.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t jinx it,\u201d Flacco said when told of the stat.\n\nThen he might not want to know the Ravens are 7-0 at home in November against the AFC North under Harbaugh.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Will Graves in Pittsburgh contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "EL DORADO, Kan.

He said he did not have specifics on Bulger\u2019s behavior in Florida, and did not know why Bulger was specifically sent to Hazelton.\n\nBulger, who ran a largely Irish mob in Boston in the 1970s and \u201980s, ratted on his rivals, the New England Mob, to the FBI while simultaneously running his own crime ring responsible for loansharking, extortion and a string of murders.\n\nBulger fled Boston in late 1994 after being tipped off by his FBI handler that he was about to be indicted. He spent the next 16 years as one of America\u2019s most wanted fugitives until he was found in 2011, living with his girlfriend in a rent-controlled apartment in Santa Monica, California.\n\nA Mafia hit man, Fotios \u201cFreddy\u201d Geas, who is said to hate \u201crats,\u201d and at least one other inmate are believed to have been involved in Bulger\u2019s killing , an ex-investigator briefed on the case said Wednesday.

Others, limp from exhaustion and nearly too big to be carried, are slung across their mothers\u2019 chests like sacks of grain, sweaty hair plastered to their heads.\n\nThere are hundreds of children traveling in the caravan of Central American migrants. That number has fluctuated somewhat as the group\u2019s size has grown and diminished, but kids of all ages are still everywhere and at risk of illness, dehydration and other dangers.\n\nAnd if it\u2019s exhausting for children, it\u2019s perhaps even more so for their parents trying to care for them as they walk long hours in the sun, sleep on the ground outdoors and rely on donations of food and clothing to get by.\n\nPamela Valle, a 28-year-old from El Progreso, Honduras, said no child should have to undertake a migration like this. But unable to find work back home, she said she had no choice but to leave and take 5-year-old Eleonor with her.\n\nEach day when they arrive in a new town on the long trek across the steamy southern Mexico countryside, she looks first for a sheltered place to sleep. On this day that was a red tarp that a group of migrants stretched across a playground in the main square of the southern town of Tapanatepec. Then she and Eleonor went in search of food and bathrooms.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you can prepare children psychologically, but we have to in some way make it like a game, like telling them it\u2019s a vacation,\u201d Valle said, adding that it has been hard on Eleonor. \u201cIt\u2019s not right, but sometimes the situation obliges you.\u201d\n\nWith Tuesday\u2019s U.S. midterm elections just days away, President Donald Trump has continued to ramp up his rhetoric against the caravan of some 4,000 migrants, repeatedly hammering Democrats and talking of sending as many as 15,000 U.S. troops to the southern border \u2014 more than double the number of migrants in this group and three other much smaller ones following in its footsteps hundreds of miles behind.\n\nIn a lengthy speech on Thursday, Trump promised an executive order next week that would automatically deny asylum to migrants who try to enter the United States illegally between ports of entry. U.S. immigration laws currently allow migrants to seek asylum no matter how they arrive in the U.S.\n\nUnless they unexpectedly find some way of traveling faster \u2014 and Mexican officials have shown no inclination to facilitate that \u2014 they are still weeks away from reaching the U.S. border. Thousands have already dropped out, applying for asylum in Mexico or accepting free bus rides home, and many more are expected to do the same. A caravan earlier this year fizzled to just about 200 who actually made it to the Tijuana-San Diego border.\n\nAfter failing to persuade Mexican authorities to provide buses that would have whisked them hundreds of miles ahead to Mexico City, the migrants were on the move again on foot Thursday, hitchhiking and scrounging rides when they could find them.\n\nTheir goal for the day was to trek 40 miles (65 kilometers) to reach the town of Matias Romero in Oaxaca state, still more than 840 miles (1,350 kilometers) to the nearest U.S. border crossing at McAllen, Texas.\n\nFor families the long trek has imposed a particularly grueling routine that has taken a toll after more than two weeks.\n\nThe migrants rise by 3 a.m. each day to take advantage of cooler temperatures. Parents try to feed kids who are awake while letting those small enough to carry or put in a stroller sleep.

Flores said she sings the traditional Spanish folk song \u201cLa Cucaracha,\u201d to while away the hours on the road.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s only that it\u2019s really tiresome to walk,\u201d she said.\n\nStanding on the steps of the town\u2019s church, 4-year-old Madelin held a small bible and pretended to preach with Pentecostal fervor, waving her arms and stomping back and forth.

They made it as far as the town of Tenosique in Mexico\u2019s Tabasco state, not far from the Guatemalan border. But the gang was threatening their other siblings and mother back home, so they returned for them.\n\n\u201cSince they were looking for us to sell drugs, they went looking to beat Keneth up,\u201d Jordy said.\n\nIf they make it to the United States, the twins hope to return to school. The brothers were a year away from finishing high school when their parents pulled them out for safety reasons.\n\n\u201cFirst we\u2019re going to have to find a place to stay,\u201d Jordy said. \u201cAfterward we\u2019ll make a little money to buy a house and live normally with our family.\u201d", "CHICAGO (AP) \u2014 In a story Nov. 1 about a couple transactions by the Chicago Cubs, The Associated Press reported erroneously that Cole Hamels\u2019 option is worth $19 million. The option is worth $20 million, not $19 million.\n\nA corrected version of the story is below:\n\nPedro Strop, Brandon Kintzler stay with Cubs\n\nChicago Cubs exercise $6.25 million option for key reliever Pedro Strop\n\nCHICAGO (AP) \u2014 The Chicago Cubs exercised their $6.25 million option for Pedro Strop on Thursday, and fellow reliever Brandon Kintzler picked up his $5 million player option.\n\nStrop can earn $750,000 in performance bonuses next year based on games finished: $250,000 each for 45, 50 and 55 games. He has never finished more than 22 games in a single season.\n\nStrop would have received a $500,000 buyout if the option had been declined.\n\nThe Cubs have to make another decision on one of their key pitchers by Friday when they face a deadline on whether to exercise Cole Hamels\u2019 option for 2019. Hamels, who turns 35 in December, went 4-3 with a 2.36 ERA in 12 starts after he was acquired in a July 27 trade with Texas.\n\nHamels\u2019 option is for $20 million. If the Cubs decline the option and pay a $6 million buyout, the Rangers would pay the Cubs an additional $6 million.\n\nChicago could decline the option and work out a new contract with the left-hander, who is 156-114 with a 3.40 ERA in 13 big league seasons.\n\nKintzler had a 7.00 ERA in 25 games with Chicago after he was acquired in a July 31 trade with Washington. The Cubs declined their $10 million team option on Tuesday.\n\nChicago also claimed outfielder Johnny Field off waivers from Minnesota on Thursday. Field made his major league debut this year and hit .222 with nine homers and 21 RBIs in 83 games with the Twins and Tampa Bay Rays.\n\nStrop, one of the baseball\u2019s most consistent relievers since he was acquired in a July 2013 trade with Baltimore, went 6-1 with 13 saves and a 2.26 ERA in 60 appearances last season.\n\nThe 33-year-old right-hander hurt his left hamstring while running to first base at Washington on Sept. 13. He missed the rest of the regular season and then threw a scoreless inning in Chicago\u2019s wild-card loss to Colorado.\n\nCubs outfielder Jason Heyward let the deadline pass for exercising an opt-out provision in his contract. Heyward keeps the $184 million, eight-year deal that pays him $106 million in the next five seasons.\n\nThe 29-year-old Heyward, who in 2016 helped the Cubs to their first title in 108 years, hit .270 with eight homers and 58 RBIs in 127 games this season. He is owed $20 million in 2019, $21 million in each of the following two seasons and $22 million apiece in the final two years. If he has 550 plate appearances next year, he would again have the right to void the deal and become a free agent.\n\n___\n\nMore AP baseball coverage: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "FILE- In this Sunday, Oct. 21, 2018, file photo, Minnesota Vikings running back Latavius Murray (25) celebrates after rushing for a 38-yard touchdown during the second half of an NFL football game against the New York Jets in East Rutherford, N.J. Fantasy\u2019s midpoint also signals some players who have been on the outer edge of a breakthrough. A handful of talents that have flown under the radar or benefited from the trade deadline will use this week as a jumping off point. (AP Photo/Howard Simmons, File)\n\nHalfway through the season, fantasy owners should know who to trust on a weekly basis. Draft position is meaningless at this point \u2014 players are either producing or they\u2019re not.\n\nFantasy\u2019s midpoint also signals some players who have been on the outer edge of a breakthrough. A handful of talents that have flown under the radar or benefited from the trade deadline will use this week as a jumping off point.\n\nSTART: Latavius Murray, RB, Vikings: By now, trusting Dalvin Cook is a fool\u2019s errand. The Minnesota ground game hasn\u2019t missed Cook as Murray has scored four touchdowns in the last three games and faces a Lions run defense that is 26th in fantasy points allowed per game to opposing running backs. Cook may play but will be limited, whereas Murray makes for a solid RB2 who also happens to average 5.1 yards per carry in his home confines.\n\nSIT: Phillip Rivers, QB, Chargers: The Seahawks are downright selfish when it comes to defending the pass, not only ranking first in fewest fantasy points allowed to opposing quarterbacks, but also third in fewest receiving yards allowed. It\u2019s certainly a tough call to sit Rivers, who has thrown multiple touchdowns in each game this season, yet the Chargers are on the road and there are better matchups to exploit.\n\nSTART: Courtland Sutton, WR, Broncos: The departure of Demaryius Thomas to the Texans sets up the path for Sutton to become Denver\u2019s top wideout. Sutton has yet to be targeted more than six times in a game but expect the big rookie to hit double digits for the first time. Houston does come into the Mile High City with a five-game win streak, but a pass defense that is 19th in yards allowed and has given up 15 touchdowns will be suspect. Sutton has just 17 catches, but eight have been for better than 20 yards. He\u2019s a great flex option whose upside will push him into must start territory soon.\n\nSIT: Isaiah Crowell, RB, Jets: In the three games since rushing for 219 yards against the Broncos, Crowell has managed only 94 yards on 37 carries, averaging 2.54 yards per attempt. Facing the Dolphins with the league\u2019s worst run defense should be the type of game that perks up Crowell, yet there\u2019s little reason to believe he\u2019ll snap out of his funk. The rise of Trenton Cannon is starting to close the window opened for Crowell upon the loss of Bilal Powell.\n\nSTART: O.J. Howard, TE, Buccaneers: In the first three games Ryan Fitzpatrick started this season, Howard averaged 20.1 yards per catch while catching 11 of 14 targets. Howard has a chance to put up a huge afternoon feasting on a Panthers defense that is last in fantasy points per game allowed to opposing tight ends. Contending with Mike Evans and DeSean Jackson is more than a handful as is, but the thought of Howard getting favorable matchups and utilizing his speed is why he should be a strong TE1.\n\nSIT: Dak Prescott, QB, Cowboys: The addition of Amari Cooper will help bolster a Dallas passing game that is 29th in yardage, good news for Prescott, who has used his running skills to put together his two best fantasy outings in consecutive weeks. The good times may pause Monday night against a Titans run defense tied for third with only three rushing touchdowns allowed. Don\u2019t expect Cooper to make an immediate impact, either.\n\nSTART: Devin Funchess, WR, Panthers: Few receivers put up solid numbers against the Ravens defense, so Funchess and his three receptions for 27 yards last week can be forgiven. Funchess has better prospects this week against a Buccaneers defense 30th in passing yards allowed and last in the league with 20 touchdown passes allowed. Funchess has yet to hit the 100-yard mark this season.\n\nSIT: LeSean McCoy, RB, Bills: It\u2019s hard to tell if McCoy\u2019s decline is simply a case of a decade of usage finally catching up to him or if the Buffalo offense is that bad. The truth lies somewhere in the middle, but that\u2019s no reason for fantasy players to wheel out McCoy against a Bears run defense that is third in yards allowed and remains the league\u2019s only team to not allow a rushing touchdown. McCoy will get his share of touches, but bad touches become worse touches as the numbers climb.\n\nSTART: Joe Flacco, QB, Ravens: Coming off his worst outing of the season, Flacco gets a great rebound opportunity against a Steelers team that he carved up for 363 yards and two touchdowns in Week 4. Pittsburgh is 16th in net passing yards allowed but has allowed 17 touchdowns. The Steelers have also given up 29 completions of 20 or more yards.\n\nSIT: Aaron Jones, RB, Packers: Green Bay\u2019s dependence on the pass and a timeshare with Jamaal Williams makes Jones a risky play despite the potential of a Sunday night slugfest against the Patriots. Jones ran for 86 yards on just 12 carries last week against the Rams and would be a high-end RB2 if fantasy owners knew he would get 18-20 touches.\n\n___\n\nFor more Week 9 fantasy advice and insights, visit RotoExperts: https://rotoexperts.com", "DAVIE, Fla.

She hasn\u2019t brought in big-name Democrats like Obama, a polarizing figure who could turn off some in the middle. Instead, she zeroes in on health care, education and veterans issues.\n\n\u201cI believe a good candidate spends her time talking to voters, listening to them, focusing on their needs,\u201d she said in an interview Thursday. \u201cWe knocked on 160,000 doors over the weekend.

(Mike Egerton/PA via AP)\n\nMANCHESTER, England (AP) \u2014 Kevin De Bruyne gave Manchester City a scare by coming off with a left knee injury near the end of a 2-0 win over Fulham in the English League Cup round of 16 on Thursday.\n\nThe Belgium midfielder, who has just returned from two months out with ligament damage in his right knee, winced after Fulham defender Timothy Fosu-Mensah landed on him as they competed for the ball. De Bruyne attempted to play on, but slumped to the ground moments later and then walked off in the 86th minute.\n\n\u201cHe is being checked by the doctors,\u201d City manager Pep Guardiola said. Asked if he was worried about the injury, Guardiola said, \u201cI don\u2019t know right now.\u201d\n\nWith most of City\u2019s star players given the night off, one of its brightest young talents took his opportunity to impress in a routine win over an opponent that has now lost five straight games in all competitions and has just one win in 10 games in the Premier League this season.\n\nBrahim Diaz, a 19-year-old Spanish forward, scored a goal in each half at Etihad Stadium and was given a standing ovation when he was substituted in the 78th after making only his second competitive start of the season.\n\nBritish newspapers reported this week that Diaz was likely to leave City next year over his frustration at a lack of playing time since moving from Malaga in 2016, and Guardiola said he understood the situation.\n\n\u201cThey know how we want to protect them,\u201d Guardiola said of Diaz and other highly regarded young players. \u201cThey know how we tried to help them in the particular way we want to play.\n\n\u201cWe want him. But, in the end, it doesn\u2019t depend on us. It\u2019s the desire of them, so we insist we want him. But his agent, and him, finally decides. No change of opinion now because he scores two goals, But in the top teams like here ... it\u2019s not easy to find space. He knew that in the beginning and he decided to stay.\u201d\n\nDiaz\u2019s first goal was fortunate, his shot taking a deflection off Fulham striker Aleksandar Mitrovic and flying past flat-footed goalkeeper Sergio Rico.\n\nHe doubled the lead in the 65th by slotting a shot high into the net from close range after Gabriel Jesus\u2019 curling effort came back off the post.\n\nCity, the defending League Cup champion, will play either Leicester or Southampton in the quarterfinals. Their game was postponed this week following the death of Leicester\u2019s owner and four other people in a helicopter crash on Saturday.\n\nWith the cup game squeezed in between two Premier League fixtures in a six-day span, Guardiola took the opportunity to play many of his fringe players. Raheem Sterling and Sergio Aguero were among those who didn\u2019t make it off the bench.\n\nDe Bruyne was given a start, however, and impressed before his injury with his teasing crosses and passes.\n\n\u201cI think today, Kevin is back,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cIt was the Kevin we know.\n\n\u201cHopefully what happened in the last minutes is not serious.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "PITTSBURGH (AP) \u2014 Joe Haden knows about losing to the Baltimore Ravens.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers cornerback has been on the losing end of 11 of his 14 games against Baltimore.

(AP Photo/Matt Rourke)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Two U.S. government agencies are giving conflicting interpretations of a safety study on cellphone radiation: One says it causes cancer in rats. The other says there\u2019s no reason for people to worry.\n\nNo new research was issued Thursday. Instead, the National Toxicology Program dialed up its concerns about a link to heart and brain cancer from a study of male rats that was made public last winter.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration, which oversees cellphone safety, disagreed with the upgraded warning. And \u201cthese findings should not be applied to human cellphone usage,\u201d said Dr. Jeffrey Shuren, FDA\u2019s chief of radiological health.\n\nWhat\u2019s most important is what happens in humans, not rats, said Dr. Otis Brawley, chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society.\n\n\u201cThe incidence of brain tumors in human beings has been flat for the last 40 years,\u201d Brawley said. \u201cThat is the absolute most important scientific fact.\u201d\n\nTHE ORIGINAL STUDY\n\nIn a $30 million study, scientists put rats and mice into special chambers and bombarded them with radiofrequency waves, like those emitted by older 2G and 3G phones, for nine hours a day for up to two years, most of their natural lives.\n\nThe levels the rodents experienced were far higher than people are typically exposed to.\n\nTHE FINDINGS\n\nLast February, the National Toxicology Program said there was a small increase in an unusual type of heart tumor in male rats, but not in mice or female rats. The agency concluded there was \u201csome evidence\u201d of a link. Also, the February report cited \u201cequivocal evidence\u201d of brain tumors in the male rats.\n\nThursday, the agency upgraded its description of those findings. The heart tumor increase marked \u201cclear evidence\u201d of cancer in male rats, it announced. There is \u201csome evidence\u201d of brain cancer.\n\nThe change came after the agency asked outside experts to analyze the findings.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the link between radiofrequency radiation and tumors in male rats is real, and the external experts agreed,\u201d said John Bucher, the toxicology agency\u2019s senior scientist.\n\nWhile his agency said the risks to rats don\u2019t directly apply to people, the study raises safety questions.\n\nTHE DISAGREEMENT\n\nThe FDA immediately disagreed, firing off a press release assuring Americans that \u201cdecades of research and hundreds of studies\u201d has made the health agency confident that the current safety limits for cellphone radiation protect the public health.\n\nPlus, FDA pointed out confusing findings from the rodent study \u2014 such as that the radiated rats lived longer than comparison rats that weren\u2019t exposed to the rays. The toxicology agency said it appeared that the radiofrequency energy helped older rats\u2019 kidneys.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason two different government agencies are clashing \u2014 they\u2019re asking different questions, said George Washington University public health professor George Gray.\n\nA former science chief for the Environmental Protection Agency, Gray said the toxicology program examined how cellphone radiation affected animals. By looking at what it means for humans, the FDA \u201cbrings in more sources of information and data than just these recent tests in rats and mice,\u201d he said in an email.\n\nSO ARE CELLPHONES SAFE?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m calling you from my cellphone,\u201d noted the cancer society\u2019s Brawley.\n\nHe pointed out one well-known risk from cellphones: Car crashes when drivers are distracted by them.\n\nAs for cancer, if people are concerned, they could use earphones or speakers, he said.\n\nThose who study risk aren\u2019t hanging up.\n\n\u201cMy family and I won\u2019t change our mobile phone habits based on this news,\u201d said George Washington\u2019s Gray, co-author of the book \u201cRisk: A Practical Guide for Deciding What\u2019s Really Safe and What\u2019s Really Dangerous in the World Around You.\u201d\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Interior Department\u2019s internal watchdog has referred an investigation of Secretary Ryan Zinke to the Justice Department, signaling a potential escalation amid a series of inquiries into Zinke\u2019s conduct.\n\nTwo people familiar with the investigation said Interior\u2019s office of inspector general referred a case involving Zinke to Justice. It is not clear what the investigation is focused on. They asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the case.\n\nZinke faces a number of probes, including one centered on a Montana land deal involving a foundation he created and the chairman of Halliburton, a prominent energy services company that does significant business with Interior.\n\nInvestigators also are reviewing Zinke\u2019s decision to block two tribes from opening a casino in Connecticut and his redrawing of boundaries to shrink a Utah national monument.\n\nZinke has denied wrongdoing, and his lawyer said Zinke has not been notified of any Justice Department investigation or inspector general referral.\n\n\u201cIt is disappointing that unsubstantiated and anonymous sources have described an IG office referral to members of the media, as this violates DOJ and IG policy direction. The secretary has done nothing wrong,\u201d lawyer Steve Ryan said in an emailed statement.\n\nNancy DiPaolo, a spokeswoman for Deputy Inspector General Mary Kendall, said she cannot comment on ongoing investigations.\n\nSpokeswoman Nicole Navas Oxman said Justice \u201cgenerally does not confirm, deny or otherwise comment on the existence or non-existence of an investigation.\u201d\n\nThe referral was first reported by The Washington Post.\n\nArizona Rep. Raul Grijalva, the top Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee, said if Democrats win a House majority next week, Zinke will be called to testify \u201con why his conduct in office merited referral to the Justice Department, whether that referral was related to the recent attempted firing of his inspector general, and his many other failures and scandals.\u201d\n\nGrijalva was referring to a short-lived bid by the Trump administration to reassign a political appointee at the Department of Housing and Urban Development to replace Kendall as acting head of the inspector general\u2019s office.\n\nHUD Secretary Ben Carson said in an Oct 12 email that then-assistant HUD secretary Suzanne Israel Tufts would take over the watchdog role. Tufts ultimately was not tapped for Interior and resigned from the administration.\n\nGrijalva and other Democratic lawmakers called for an investigation this summer after reports that a charitable foundation created by Zinke and run by his wife, Lola, was allowing a company co-owned by Halliburton chairman David Lesar to use the foundation\u2019s land for a commercial development.\n\nZinke also met Lesar, Lesar\u2019s son and Montana developer Casey Malmquist in his Washington office last year, according to emails the Democrats received in a public records request.\n\nZinke has come under scrutiny for his travel practices and other actions as secretary. He has dismissed the allegations as politically motivated.\n\nThe inspector general\u2019s office said in a report last month that Lola Zinke was allowed to ride in government vehicles with him despite a department policy that prohibits nongovernment officials from doing so. The report also said Interior spent more than $25,000 to provide security for the couple when they took a vacation to Turkey and Greece.\n\nInterior spokeswoman Heather Swift said the report shows Zinke \u201cfollows all relevant laws and regulations\u201d and that his travel was reviewed and approved by career ethics officials and department lawyers.", "BUFFALO, N.Y.

But the part that Wagner remembers: Rivers knew the exact name of Seattle\u2019s defensive call.\n\n\u201cHe called timeout and was like, \u2018Dang, they\u2019re running strong something,\u2019 and I\u2019m like we just changed the name yesterday, how\u2019d you do that?\u201d Wagner recalled. \u201cMaybe he just luckily chose that, I don\u2019t know. It was kind of funny, I\u2019m like how did he know the name? The quarterbacks know the play, they never know the name of the play.\u201d\n\nKnowing the play didn\u2019t really matter back in August, but it will Sunday when the surging Chargers face the equally improving Seahawks. Los Angeles (5-2) has won four straight and is coming off a bye week following its 20-19 win over Tennessee in London. The Seahawks (4-3) have won four of five \u2014 including a victory in London \u2014 and the game against the Chargers starts a stretch with six of the final nine games at home for Seattle.\n\nAnd Rivers is the introduction to a challenging month of elite quarterbacks the Seahawks will face and challenge Seattle\u2019s overhauled defense that has climbed its way back to being among the best in the NFL halfway through the season. After Rivers, the Seahawks will face Jared Goff, Aaron Rodgers and Cam Newton in consecutive weeks.\n\n\u201cThe biggest difference is you used to go in \u2014 and this is not by any means slighting the roster, the defensive lineup now \u2014 but you used to go into that game, and you could just say, who is on Seattle\u2019s defense, and you could write out every one right because they had been together for so long, back-to-back Super Bowls, won the Super Bowl against Denver,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cNow there\u2019s just been so much change on that defense, but there\u2019s still the same scheme, and there\u2019s plenty of names that you can recognize. So it\u2019s a good group.\u201d\n\nThe Chargers should get running back Melvin Gordon back after he missed the win in London with a hamstring injury. Gordon has combined with fellow running back Austin Ekeler to have 1,283 yards from scrimmage and the pair is averaging 6.65 yards per touch.\n\nSeattle\u2019s running backs are providing and equally important contribution to the Seahawks recent success. Chris Carson has become Seattle\u2019s primary runner and posted his third 100-yard game in last week\u2019s win over Detroit. Beginning with Week 3, only the Los Angeles Rams have more carries or yards rushing than the Seahawks \u2014 and Los Angeles has played one more game.\n\n\u201cI think they know what\u2019s working. That\u2019s kind of their formula,\u201d Chargers coach Anthony Lynn said. \u201cThey have been averaging about 30 rush attempts a game and it\u2019s working.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what else to watch as the former AFC West foes meet for the 51st time overall:\n\n200 STRAIGHT FOR RIVERS\n\nRivers will make his 200th consecutive regular-season start. He\u2019ll be the fourth quarterback and the eighth player since the merger to reach that milestone. The 15-year veteran is off to one of the best starts of his career. He\u2019s second in the league with a 117.8 passer rating and tied for third in touchdowns with 17.\n\n\u201cObviously, you want to be able to out there and help. It\u2019s not just be out there. You want to play at a high level, and that\u2019s been up and down over 199, but being out there means something,\u201d Rivers said.\n\nTHE OTHER QB\n\nWhile much of the focus has been on the quarterbacks Seattle is about to face, the Seahawks\u2019 own QB is playing pretty well.\n\nRussell Wilson posted the first perfect passer rating in Seahawks history last week against Detroit when he completed 14 of 17 passes for 248 yards and three touchdowns. With the focus on the run game, Wilson\u2019s task passing has become efficiency and taking advantage when opportunities are presented. In the past three games, Wilson has nine TD passes on just 61 pass attempts.\n\nBIG PLAY WILLIAMS\n\nWith most opposing defenses continuing to double-team Keenan Allen, Chargers WR Tyrell Williams has emerged as a big-play threat. Six of his 10 receptions in the past three games have been for 26 yards or more and three have gone for touchdowns. According to Sportradar, four of those receptions have been on go routes with the other two being post routes.\n\nHEAVY HEARTS\n\nSunday will be the first home game for the Seahawks since the death of owner Paul Allen, who died on Oct. 15. He was 65. Allen was responsible for purchasing the team and keeping the Seahawks in Seattle, along with the construction of CenturyLink Field.\n\nSeattle\u2019s first coach, Jack Patera, also passed away earlier this week at age 85.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "HARRISBURG, Pa.

Apple Inc. reports earnings Thursday, Nov. 1. (AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez, File)\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 Apple\u2019s faithful customers aren\u2019t snapping up iPhones quite as enthusiastically as anticipated heading into the crucial holiday shopping season.\n\nBut the latest models costing $1,000 and more are popular enough to keep propelling profits ever higher for the world\u2019s most prosperous company.\n\nThe mixed bag emerged in the quarterly results Apple released Thursday amid jitters about how the company and the rest of the technology industry will fare in the face of myriad threats to growth. Those include increased government regulation, the escalating U.S. trade war with China and the specter of rising interest rates crimping economic growth.\n\nApple\u2019s performance for the July-through-September period and its revenue outlook for holiday season evidently weren\u2019t enough to ease investors\u2019 concerns.\n\nThe Cupertino, California, company rattled Wall Street even more by unexpectedly announcing that it will no longer disclose the number of iPhones it sells each quarter, beginning with the current period ending in December.\n\n\u201cThis is a bit of a gut punch for everyone used to more transparency,\u201d said Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives.\n\nApple\u2019s stock almost 7 percent to $207.67 in extended trading after all the news came out.\n\nOther major smartphone makers don\u2019t reveal their quarterly shipments of their devices either, but Apple has broken down its iPhone numbers ever since the phone\u2019s debut 11 years ago. The abrupt change in policy raised suspicions that management might be trying to mask a downturn in the popularity of the product that generates most of Apple\u2019s profits.\n\nThe change apparently was triggered by Apple\u2019s frustration with investors\u2019 fixation on its iPhone sales while glossing over other key areas, such as the robust growth in its services division that collects commissions on app sales and handles subscriptions to its music-streaming service.\n\n\u201cThe number of (iPhone) units sold during any quarter has not been necessarily representative of the underlying strength of our business,\u201d Luca Maestri, Apple\u2019s chief financial officer, told analysts in a conference call.\n\nAlthough there may be some logic to the rationale for the long term, \u201cthis is going to be a difficult pill to swallow in the short term,\u201d Ives said. \u201cIt\u2019s like suddenly telling people (in the U.S.) that they have to start driving on the left side of the road.\u201d\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook also sought to reassure analysts during the conference call with an explanation that indicated the company expects to keep making more money even if iPhone sales should falter.\n\n\u201cThis is a little bit like if you go to the market and you push your cart up to the cashier and she says or he says, \u2018How many units do you have in there?\u2019\u201d Cook said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter a lot how many units there are in there in terms of the overall value of what\u2019s in the cart.\u201d\n\nAnalysts had expected Apple to sell 78 million iPhones during the holiday season, but now the company isn\u2019t going to reveal whether it hit the target or not.\n\nApple earned $14.1 billion, a 32 percent increase from the same time last year during the past quarter. Earnings per share came in at $2.91, topping the average estimate of $2.79 among analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research.\n\nRevenue for the period climbed 20 percent from last year to $62.9 billion.\n\nApple sold 46.9 million iPhones in the past quarter, slightly below analyst estimates.\n\nThe company Apple released its latest iPhones, models selling from $1,000 to $1,500, at the tail end of the quarter, and those appeared to get off to a strong start. Apple fetched an average of $793 per iPhone in the quarter, up 28 percent from the same time last year.\n\nThanks to last year\u2019s release of the first iPhone to cost $1,000 , the average price has increased by at least 11 percent in each of the past four quarters. If Apple follows that trend in the current quarter, the average iPhone price should rise above $800 for the first time in a show of people\u2019s love affair with the device.\n\nBut now everyone will be left to guess whether Apple clears that financial hurdle during the holiday season.\n\n_____\n\nElements of this story were generated by Automated Insights (http://automatedinsights.com/ap) using data from Zacks Investment Research.", "LOWER ALLOWAYS CREEK TOWNSHIP, N.J.

(AP) \u2014 Josef Martinez knew he was receiving one of Major League Soccer\u2019s top awards.\n\nThe Atlanta United star was caught off guard by the presenter.\n\nAfter the greatest goal-scoring season in MLS history, the Venezuelan striker got a surprise when countryman and Atlanta Braves outfielder Ender Inciarte showed up Thursday at United\u2019s training facility to hand out the Golden Boot.\n\nInciarte said Martinez\u2019s 31-goal season , which shattered the league\u2019s previous scoring record, provided a much-needed bit of good news to their troubled homeland.\n\n\u201cI love the things he\u2019s been able to accomplish not only for Atlanta, but also for Venezuela,\u201d said Inciarte, who donned United\u2019s red-and-black, five-striped jersey for the ceremony and also got a tour of the team\u2019s training facility. \u201cA lot of people in Venezuela are going through a lot. Having somebody doing great things, the way he\u2019s been doing, it\u2019s a sign of hope for them.\u201d\n\nMartinez broke the previous MLS record of 27 goals, which was shared by Roy Lassiter, Chris Wondolowski and Bradley Wright-Phillips, leading United to a second-place finish in the Eastern Conference and its second straight playoff appearance.\n\nAtlanta will begin a two-legged conference semifinal series against New York City FC on Sunday at Yankee Stadium.\n\nThe 25-year-old Martinez was clearly pleased with his first Golden Boot, but he\u2019s more focused on bringing another trophy to Atlanta.\n\nThe MLS Cup.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still a lot to accomplish this season,\u201d Martinez said through an interpreter. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re here: to win things. If it\u2019s as a team, that\u2019s even better, because that\u2019s what\u2019s important.\u201d\n\nMartinez formerly played with Torino in Italy\u2019s Serie A, but he struggled as a winger and scored just seven goals in 58 league games.\n\nAcquired by Atlanta for its inaugural 2017 season, he moved to a more natural position in front of the net and responded with 19 goals in 20 games. If not for missing more than two months with a quadriceps injury sustained in an international match with Venezuela, he might\u2019ve broken the scoring record a year ago.\n\nThis season, Martinez improved his skills away from the ball and showed an ability to score with either foot and especially his head, even though he\u2019s generously listed at just 5-foot-7.\n\nHe said his most memorable goal was No. 28, the record breaker against Orlando. Julian Gressel delivered a pass to Martinez, who quickly flicked the ball ahead and gave a shoulder-dipping deke that sent a defender flying past him and put keeper Joe Bendik on his backside. Martinez turned the ball back inside off his left foot and calmly flicked it over Bendik with his right to clinch a 2-1 victory.\n\nMartinez, who is also a finalist for the league\u2019s MVP award, endured a four-game scoring drought late in the season, finally breaking through with a penalty kick in the finale at Toronto. It was the only highlight in a 4-1 loss that cost United its first major trophy. New York Red Bulls won their final game and edged out Atlanta by two points for the Supporters\u2019 Shield that goes to the team with top regular-season record.\n\nCoach Tata Martino, who was instrumental in putting Martinez in an attacking system where he could flourish, has announced he will leave United at the end of the playoffs , reportedly to take over as Mexico\u2019s national team coach.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the one who opened the door for me to come to Atlanta,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cWe have a great relationship on and off the field. Usually, when I talk about our relationship, I\u2019m not talking about soccer. I\u2019m talking about other things in life. We just have to take advantage of him while he\u2019s here.\u201d\n\nMartino\u2019s impending departure has led to speculation that Martinez may be looking to get out as well, perhaps for another shot in Europe.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s definitely someone who has left his footprint on Atlanta,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cBut now we have two really important games that we\u2019re focusing on.

(AP) \u2014 The Carolina Panthers have stability at the quarterback position. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers are desperately in search of the same.\n\nThe teams appear headed in different directions entering an NFC South showdown Sunday in Charlotte \u2014 and quarterback play is a big reason why.\n\nRyan Fitzpatrick replaces Jameis Winston, who was benched after committing 11 turnovers in his last 3 \u00bd games for the Buccaneers (3-4). With the former Harvard standout back at the helm, the Bucs are trying to rekindle some of the \u201cFitzmagic\u201d that helped them to a 2-0 start that included a win over the New Orleans Saints.\n\nThey\u2019ve since lost four of their last five.\n\n\u201cI think Jameis is one of the best quarterbacks in the world and I think he will be back,\u201d Bucs coach Dirk Koetter said. \u201cA lot of teams don\u2019t switch because they have an untested backup or they\u2019re afraid to put their backup in there \u2014 and we don\u2019t have either of those. Right now, we just have to stop turning the ball over and so we\u2019re going to go with Fitz.\u201d\n\nPanthers coach Ron Rivera has never benched his franchise quarterback Cam Newton because of his performance.\n\nAnd he\u2019s not about to this year.\n\nThe Panthers (5-2) enter the game looking for their 10th straight home win behind Newton, who is playing his best football since earning league MVP honors in 2015 and leading Carolina to the Super Bowl. Newton has 17 combined touchdowns. He\u2019s thrown only four interceptions all season \u2014 the same amount Winston threw in last week\u2019s loss to the Cincinnati Bengals.\n\nRivera said he realizes how lucky he is to have Newton at the helm.\n\n\u201cIt shows you how important it is to have a franchise quarterback and have the position stabilized,\u201d Rivera said.\n\nPROLIFIC OFFENSE\n\nDespite the quarterback change, the Bucs are still first in the NFL in passing and total offense. They\u2019ve thrown for 2,634 yards \u2014 the second-highest total through the first seven games of a season in NFL history behind the 2000 St. Louis Rams (2,637). They have 19 touchdown passes, third-most in the league behind Kansas City (26) and Indianapolis (23).\n\nKoetter concedes the Bucs, who are 28th in rushing at 91.3 yards per game, have evolved into a pass-first team.\n\nPanthers safety Eric Reid said Carolina is preparing the same way regardless of who is under center, noting that both QBs like to throw the ball deep.\n\n\u201cTheir offense runs the same with both guys,\u201d Reid said.\n\nNEWTON\u2019S SHOULDER\n\nRivera didn\u2019t appear concerned about Newton\u2019s right shoulder, even though the eighth-year QB has been limited in practice the last two weeks. In fact, Newton declined last week to throw a Hail Mary pass just before halftime, telling the coaches he didn\u2019t feel comfortable doing that. That might explain, in part, why Newton hasn\u2019t attempted many passes down the field this season.\n\nHowever, Koetter said he doesn\u2019t see anything wrong with Newton\u2019s arm strength.\n\n\u201cMan if he\u2019s got a sore arm, I\u2019d hate to see the real deal,\u201d Koetter said. \u201cCam has always had a cannon. He can stand flat-footed and put that thing on a line. I\u2019ve been in this division a long time, and arm strength is probably about the 159th thing on the list that you\u2019d be worried about with Cam.\u201d\n\nPROTECTING CAM\n\nThe Bucs will make it a priority pressure Newton, but that hasn\u2019t proven easy to do this season.\n\nNewton has been sacked a league-low 10 times because he\u2019s getting the ball out quicker playing in new coordinator Norv Turner\u2019s scheme and the patchwork offensive line is \u201cprotecting Cam better than he ever has been before,\u201d Rivera said.\n\nNewton said while a lot of people think Carolina\u2019s offensive line is made up of \u201cmisfits and undesirables,\u201d he added \u201cthose guys have been playing lights out.\u201d\n\nFAST START\n\nDefensive end Jason Pierre-Paul has a sack in a Bucs franchise-record six consecutive games. With eight of the team\u2019s 16 sacks through seven games, he\u2019s nearly halfway to the career-best 16 \u00bd he had for the New York Giants when he was an All-Pro in 2011. Tampa Bay, which acquired Pierre-Paul in an offseason trade, hasn\u2019t had a player finish with 10 or more sacks since Simeon Rice in 2005.\n\n\u201cI am so excited about what Jason\u2019s brought to us,\u201d defensive coordinator Mark Duffner said. \u201cHe practices hard, he prepares hard. This guy is on a mission and it\u2019s been beautiful to see and be around.\u201d\n\nMORE OF MOORE\n\nThe Buccaneers can expect to see a heavy dose of speedy rookie wide receiver D.J. Moore. With Torrey Smith out with a knee injury last week against Baltimore, Moore took advantage of his increased playing time and led the Panthers with 90 yards receiving and added 39 yards rushing on two carries. Smith is out this Sunday, too.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Fred Goodall in Tampa, Florida, contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFor more NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/NFL and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL", "FILE- In this Sunday, Oct. 28, 2018, file photo, Jacksonville Jaguars head coach Doug Marrone grimaces during a press conference after an NFL football game against Philadelphia Eagles at Wembley stadium in London.

(AP) \u2014 Jacksonville Jaguars coach Doug Marrone is shouldering the blame for the team\u2019s four-game losing streak, saying he \u201chasn\u2019t done a good enough job for whatever reason to get everyone\u2019s mind in the right place.\u201d\n\nMarrone insists he\u2019s not trying to be a \u201cmartyr, a shield or anything like that.\u201d\n\nTruth is he\u2019s protecting everyone: top executive Tom Coughlin, general manager Dave Caldwell, inconsistent quarterback Blake Bortles , unavailable running back Leonard Fournette and dozens more underperforming players on an underachieving team.\n\nThe Jaguars (3-5) have been one of the NFL\u2019s biggest busts in 2018, especially last month when they went 0-for-October and looked nothing like the team that advanced to the AFC championship game nine months earlier.\n\n\u201cThere is a story out there about this team. It is an ugly story,\u201d said Marrone, who is counting on his team to regroup during its Week 9 bye.\n\n\u201cBut the story hasn\u2019t ended. We can still control how this story reads. When we get away, we have to think long and hard about it. We have to come back and we have to figure out what the story is going to be on the 2018 team.\u201d\n\nInjuries are a big reason for the slide, especially with Fournette \u2014 the team\u2019s offensive centerpiece \u2014 missing six games because of a strained right hamstring. But Coughlin, Caldwell and Bortles deserve criticism.\n\nCoughlin designed an old-school team to play in a pass-happy league, one in which running the ball is barely important and hiding a mediocre quarterback is next to impossible. The ground-and-pound Jags want to control the clock, limit Bortles\u2019 throws and play stout defense. It can work, but it usually needs everything to go right.\n\nTurnovers, dropped passes, defensive lapses, the Jaguars have seen those too often and aren\u2019t built to handle much adversity or overcome double-digit deficits.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t help that Jacksonville is getting so little from its rookie class and its free-agent crop.\n\nCoughlin and Caldwell were so confident they had a playoff team in place that they used the draft to prepare for 2019, adding several down-the-road replacements for veteran starters. First-round pick and defensive lineman Taven Bryan has nine tackles in eight games. Second-round receiver DJ Chark has 12 catches for 159 yards to go along with a fumble and several costly drops. Third-round safety Ronnie Harrison has been the best of the bunch while playing mostly in certain defensive packages.\n\nRight tackle Will Richardson (fourth) is on injured reserve. Quarterback Tanner Lee (fifth) remains on the practice squad. Linebacker Leon Jacobs (sixth) has barely played outside special teams. And punter Logan Cooke (seventh) has failed repeatedly to flip the field when needed.\n\nFree agents Andrew Norwell, Donte Moncrief, D.J. Hayden, Austin Seferian-Jenkins and Marqise Lee have been equally disappointing.\n\nNorwell, a 2017 All-Pro guard from Carolina, was expected to bolster the offensive line and help give the Jaguars one of the best running attacks in the league. Instead, he looks unworthy of his five-year, $66.5 million contract.\n\nMoncrief, who signed a one-year deal worth $9.6 million, was supposed to offset the loss of physical receiver Allen Robinson. He has 29 catches for 379 yards and two scores.\n\nHayden (toe) has missed six consecutive games, and Seferian-Jenkins (core muscle) and Lee (knee) are on injured reserve.\n\n\u201cPlaying football is easy,\u201d defensive tackle Malik Jackson said. \u201cStaying healthy is the hard part.\u201d\n\nA legitimate franchise quarterback might be able to make up for all of Jacksonville\u2019s deficiencies. But Coughlin and Caldwell decided to give Bortles a three-year, $54 million contract in February, betting that the fifth-year starter would continue developing and adding to a growing list of turnover-free games.\n\nNeither has happened, and the Jaguars are seemingly stuck with Bortles because of his $21 million contract in 2019. He has 10 touchdown passes, eight interceptions and three lost fumbles to go along with 18 sacks.\n\nThrow in a training camp fight, two weeklong suspensions, a locker room scuffle last month, four players getting detained in London because of an unsettled nightclub tab, Jalen Ramsey\u2019s mouth and the ultra-confident defense failing to maintain its 2017 form, and the Jaguars have been more of a farce than a force in the AFC.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing as a team is we\u2019ve got to keep our belief strong,\u201d defensive end Calais Campbell said. \u201cNo matter what the outside noise says or does, we just got to keep our belief strong. Five losses in this league this early sucks, but five losses throughout the season, that\u2019s not bad at all; that\u2019s a heck of a year.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of ball left to play. We made it real hard on ourselves, but I truly believe the guys that we have here are built to be able to do something special, even considering our current circumstance.\u201d\n\nMarrone hopes to get Fournette, Hayden and cornerback A.J. Bouye (calf) back after the bye week. He also wouldn\u2019t rule out staff and lineup changes.\n\nAlready saddled with two division losses at home, the Jaguars have little room for error after the break if they\u2019re able to write a feel-good ending to their \u201cugly story.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen no one picks you to win and everyone thinks you are going to stink, it\u2019s, \u2018Let\u2019s go out there and prove everybody wrong and play with a chip on our shoulder and go,\u2019\u201d Marrone said. \u201cThen all of a sudden, when everybody is on the bandwagon, it\u2019s the opposite. \u2018Let\u2019s prove everybody right.\u2019 Either way, you are trying to prove right or wrong what is going on.\n\n\u201cWe just haven\u2019t lived up to the expectations to this day.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 A former cast member of the television reality series \u201cBad Girls Club\u201d has pleaded guilty in New York to wire fraud.\n\nShannade Clermont entered the plea Thursday in Manhattan federal court.\n\nProsecutors say the 24-year-old Clermont stole debit card information from a man who died shortly after a \u201cprostitution date\u201d with her.\n\nClermont told U.S. District Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald that she knew she was breaking the law when she used stolen debit cards to buy things on the internet.\n\nSpectators to the plea included seven family members of the man she visited in January 2017.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci)\n\nCOLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump implored voters on Thursday to reject Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill and to instead install a Republican in her seat who would fully back his agenda.\n\nTrump appeared at a rollicking campaign rally in Columbia, home of the state\u2019s largest university, in an airline hangar draped in American flags. It was his second rally in an 11-stop, eight-state tour designed to boost Republican turnout ahead of Tuesday\u2019s crucial midterm elections.\n\nThe president, accompanied by McCaskill\u2019s Republican challenger, Josh Hawley, declared that Hawley \u201cwill be a star.\u201d\n\nHawley, the current attorney general, sought to link McCaskill to Trump\u2019s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, who lost the state in 2016 by nearly 19 percentage points.\n\n\u201cClaire McCaskill has spent her lifetime in politics just like Hillary,\u201d Hawley said. \u201cClaire McCaskill wanted us to call Hillary Clinton \u2018Madam President.\u2019 On Nov. 6, we\u2019re going to call Claire McCaskill \u2018fired.\u2019\u201d\n\nWith four days to go until midterm elections that determine control of Congress, Republicans are optimistic they could make gains in the Senate, but they might struggle to maintain a majority in the House.\n\nMcCaskill is among a number of vulnerable Democrats running in red states. She is a top target for Republicans seeking to expand the party\u2019s slim 51-49 edge in the U.S. Senate.\n\nMcCaskill is pitching herself as a moderate as she seeks to hold onto her seat. She has sought to distance herself from \u201ccrazy Democrats\u201d and said in an appearance on Fox News that she supports Trump\u2019s efforts to secure the southern border. Hawley has dismissed her efforts and argues that she is not the right fit for an increasingly conservative state.\n\nTrump said that McCaskill had been \u201csaying such nice things about me. But you know what? She\u2019ll never vote with me. That\u2019s the problem.\u201d\n\nA check of her record, however, shows that McCaskill votes with the president about half the time, though she has opposed him on some key issues, including his tax cuts and the recent confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nThe president, who this week threatened to end a constitutional right that automatically grants citizenship to any baby born in the United States, railed against the 14th Amendment during the Thursday rally, calling it a \u201ccrazy, lunatic policy\u201d supported by Democrats.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats want to continue giving automatic birthright citizenship to every child born to an illegal immigrant, even if they\u2019ve been on our soil for a mere matter of seconds,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHundreds of thousands of children born to illegal immigrants are made automatic citizens of the United States every year because of this crazy, lunatic policy that we can end.\u201d\n\nThe non-partisan Migration Policy Institute estimates that there are more than 4 million U.S.-born children under the age of 18 who have an unauthorized immigrant parent. Most legal scholars say it would take a new constitutional amendment to alter the current one granting citizenship to anyone born in America.\n\nTrump expressed optimism for the midterm elections, though he noted that Republican momentum had been blunted in recent days by \u201ctwo maniacs\u201d \u2014 a reference to a mail bomb scare and a mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue.

She has strong support among liberal and female Democratic lawmakers and is believed to have a solid shot at winning the job, for which she will need at least 218 votes, a House majority.\n\nYet it is unclear if she will be able to do so. Many Democrats say it is time for fresh faces to replace Pelosi and other party leaders, who are all in their late 70s, and say GOP efforts to demonize her as an out-of-touch liberal have made her a liability for the party.\n\nIt is widely believed that if Republicans retain their hold on the House, frustrated Democrats would replace Pelosi, No. 2 leader Steny Hoyer of Maryland and No. 3 leader Jim Clyburn of South Carolina.\n\nThe caucus\u2019 letter does not name who it wants to see move into the two top jobs.\n\nClyburn is black and has expressed an interest in moving up, according to many Democrats speaking on condition of anonymity to describe private discussions.

It\u2019s pretty awesome.\u201d\n\nLaine wristed a shot past James Reimer on a power play for a 2-1 lead with 4:46 left in the second, then slapped a one-timer for the winner on a two-man advantage from atop the left circle 3:28 into the third. He scored on an empty net for his fifth career hat trick.\n\nMathieu Perreault scored the opening goal for the Jets (8-4-1), and captain Blake Wheeler and defenseman Dustin Byfuglien had three assists each. The Panthers (2-5-3), who outshot Winnipeg 38-36, tied the score twice on goals by Keith Yandle and Evgenii Dadonov.\n\nFlorida captain Aleksander Barkov, also a native of Finland, assisted on Yandle\u2019s goal.\n\n\u201cOverall, as a team, we played good in their zone,\u201d Barkov said. \u201cWe have another game (Friday), and we have to concentrate on that.\u201d\n\nLaine, whose 44 goals were second to Alex Ovechkin\u2019s 49 last season for the NHL lead, had just three goals and two assists in 12 games.\n\n\u201cTonight was a good example of what we see from (Laine) so often,\u201d Winnipeg coach Paul Maurice said. \u201cHe scored three, but I think he could have had seven.

They controlled the puck most of the opening period, but Connor Hellebuyck kept them at bay, turning back 18 shots in the opening frame.\n\nHellebuyck denied Dadonov on a breakaway and helped the Jets kill a penalty before Perreault struck on the other side, scoring the go-ahead goal on a rebound with 1:26 remaining.\n\n\u201cWe generated a ton of chances,\u201d Florida coach Bob Boughner said. \u201cThis is what it\u2019s been like since the season started.

Smith and the Redskins have averaged 212.7 yards in the air, and only three teams have fewer passing touchdowns than their eight. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik File)\n\nLANDOVER, Md. (AP) \u2014 All games and no practice reps make Alex Smith a dull quarterback.\n\nInjuries to receivers Jamison Crowder and Paul Richardson and running backs Adrian Peterson and Chris Thompson have kept them from getting work in with Smith at practice and stunted the Washington Redskins\u2019 passing game so far this season. The NFC East-leading Redskins have run all over opponents with a banged-up Peterson, boasted a much-improved defense and is only missing the kind of effective passing game they\u2019ll see Sunday when they host Matt Ryan and the Atlanta Falcons.\n\n\u201cI think the success for a lot of NFL teams is if you can stop the run, and you can run the ball and control the clock, you\u2019ve got a chance to win some games. We\u2019ve been able to do all three,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cThe passing game has been up and down. It\u2019s been slow. We\u2019ve been without our full group of receivers for a little bit of time. ... We just have to find a way to do a better job.\u201d\n\nSmith and the Redskins (5-2) have averaged 212.7 yards in the air, and only three teams have fewer passing touchdowns than their eight. They won\u2019t have Crowder again this week as he\u2019ll miss his fourth consecutive game with an ankle injury.\n\nAtlanta (3-4) has been battered by injuries to both starting guards and safeties, running back Devonta Freeman and linebacker Deion Jones and as a result hasn\u2019t lived up to preseason expectations. Ryan has held up his end of the bargain with 15 touchdowns and two interceptions and leads the NFL with 333.6 yards a game with the benefit of a receiving corps of Julio Jones, Mohamed Sanu and rookie Calvin Ridley.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s obviously done a tremendous job of reading defenses and putting a lot of different guys in advantageous situations,\u201d tight end Austin Hooper said. \u201cThat\u2019s just a credit to the work Matt\u2019s put in all year. If he keeps it going, good things will come.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s also the Redskins\u2019 message to Smith, who also has thrown only two picks and been solid at managing the ball even if the yards haven\u2019t piled up. Smith doesn\u2019t believe he has been too cautious, but acknowledges the passing game has to be far more effective in certain areas.\n\n\u201cThe ones that stand out though are the situational stuff, the third downs that you don\u2019t convert because they would have given you a whole other rack of opportunities,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThe red zone, obviously because it\u2019s so vital. I think the situational stuff always tends to jump out when you don\u2019t execute, because of its magnitude.\u201d\n\nWashington is 22nd in the league on third down and 25th in the red zone. Those particular failings speak to Smith still needing to get in sync with tight end Jordan Reed, Crowder, Richardson and Josh Doctson in his first year with the Redskins.\n\nWith so many missed opportunities at practice because of injuries, Smith said one of the biggest hurdles is he and receivers reading the same coverage from a defense and being on the same page.\n\n\u201cThere is really a premium on both the receiver and quarterbacks seeing the same thing and reacting to it the same way, and I think that\u2019s the hard part,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThere are times when it is cut and dried, when it\u2019s pure zone and we\u2019re spacing the field and timing routes and there are times when it\u2019s purely man and you just beat him. But a lot of times, it\u2019s a blend of the two and I think you\u2019ve got to see the same thing, react to it the same way.\u201d\n\nSome things to watch when the Falcons visit the Redskins:\n\nPETERSON TIME\n\nBlips in the passing game have made it all the more valuable that Peterson is still running strong at 33. Peterson has rushed for 587 yards and four touchdowns through seven games and is the most important piece of Washington\u2019s offense.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s playing so well right now, when we call a running play, he better be out there,\u201d coach Jay Gruden said. \u201cI expect him to be a major part of our offense moving forward. He has to be right now, the way we are throwing the ball.\u201d\n\nJULIO HISTORY\n\nJones needs 134 yards receiving in his 102nd career game to become the fastest to 10,000. He\u2019s averaging 116 yards a game as part of a deep group of Falcons receivers the Redskins are concerned about.\n\n\u201cThey get open, they separate, they go up and get the ball,\u201d Washington linebacker Zach Brown said. \u201cIt\u2019s just hard to have corners to deal with that.\u201d\n\nCLINTON-DIX DEBUT\n\nWhile the Falcons stood pat at Tuesday\u2019s trade deadline, the Redskins acquired safety Ha Ha Clinton-Dix from Green Bay for a fourth-round pick. The combination of Clinton-Dix and D.J. Swearinger, who had two interceptions last week against the Giants, gives Washington arguably the best duo of safeties in the league.\n\n\u201cI came here to play,\u201d Clinton-Dix said. \u201cI came here to work. Even if that\u2019s on special teams, I\u2019m just helping contribute to this team any way I can, because No. 20 is going to be suited up this weekend, and you can bet that.\u201d\n\nROAD WOES\n\nPart of Atlanta\u2019s rough road so far this season has been an 0-2 record on the road with a close loss at Philadelphia and a blowout one at Pittsburgh. The same offense that has put up over 32 points a game at home has managed just over two touchdowns on the road.\n\n\u201cThe biggest issue is cadence, or the lack thereof, in the ability to hear,\u201d Hooper said. \u201cIt\u2019s just in understanding the subtle, nonverbal signals that allow you to play fast.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press Writer George Henry in Flowery Branch, Georgia, contributed.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "BISMARCK, N.D.

When asked if he had any last words, he said, \u201cLet\u2019s rock.\u201d\n\nThe eyewitness says he grimaced as a sponge was put over his head. The witnesss says the inmate raised up in his chair when each jolt of electricity went through him.\n\nIn opting for the electric chair over a lethal injection as Tennessee allowed him, Zagorski had argued it would be a quicker and less painful way to die. He became only the second person to die in the electric chair in Tennessee since 1960.\n\nNationwide, only 14 other people have been put to death in the electric chair since 2000, including a Virginia inmate in 2013.\n\nProsecutors say Zagorski shot John Dotson and Jimmy Porter and slit their throats in April 1983 after robbing them during a drug deal.\n\n___\n\n7:30 p.m.\n\nTennessee has used its electric chair for the first time since 2007, executing an inmate for the killings of two other men during a 1980s drug deal.\n\nAuthorities say 63-year-old Edmund Zagorski was pronounced dead at 7:26 p.m. Thursday at a Nashville maximum-security prison.\n\nIn opting for the electric chair over a lethal injection as Tennessee allowed him, Zagorski had argued it would be a quicker and less painful way to die. He became only the second person to die in the electric chair in Tennessee since 1960.\n\nNationwide, only 14 other people have been put to death in the electric chair since 2000, including a Virginia inmate in 2013.\n\nProsecutors say Zagorski shot John Dotson and Jimmy Porter and slit their throats in April 1983 after robbing them when they sought to buy marijuana from him.\n\n___\n\n7:10 p.m.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has denied a request to halt the scheduled execution of a Tennessee inmate in the electric chair.\n\nThe court said in a statement Thursday evening that it would not block the state\u2019s plans to put to death 63-year-old inmate Edmund Zagorski at a Nashville prison.\n\nZagorski had asked the court take up his claim that it\u2019s unconstitutional to force him to choose between the electric chair and lethal injection. His attorney said Zagorski chose the chair thinking it would be quicker and less painful, but he maintains both methods are unconstitutional\n\nThe court statement says Justice Sonia Sotomayor was the dissenting voice, noting Zagorski\u2019s decision to opt for the electric chair.\n\nSays Sotomayor: \u201cHe did so not because he thought that it was a humane way to die, but because he thought that the three-drug cocktail that Tennessee had planned to use was even worse. Given what most people think of the electric chair, it\u2019s hard to imagine a more striking testament \u2014 from a person with more at stake \u2014 to the legitimate fears raised by the lethal-injection drugs that Tennessee uses.\u201d\n\n___\n\n4 p.m.\n\nVigils have been organized across Tennessee to oppose the state\u2019s plans to put an inmate to death in the electric chair.\n\nEdmund Zagorski is scheduled to be executed at chair 7 p.m. CDT Thursday at a maximum-security prison in Nashville.\n\nTennesseans for Alternatives to the Death Penalty have planned vigils at the West End United Methodist Church in Nashville, the Market Square stage in Knoxville, and the Memphis Theological Seminary. All the vigils were set to begin at 6:30 p.m. local time.\n\nZagorski was sentenced to death in 1984 for killing two men during a drug deal. He requested the electric chair over lethal injection just days before he was to be executed three weeks ago, prompting the governor to step in to allow the state time to prepare for a change of execution method.\n\n___\n\n11:20 a.m.\n\nWith just hours left before his scheduled execution, condemned Tennessee inmate Edmund Zagorski is asking the U.S. Supreme Court to put a stop to the plan.\n\nOn Thursday, Zagorski asked the court take up his claim that it\u2019s unconstitutional to force him to choose between the electric chair and lethal injection. Zagorski chose the chair because he thinks it will be quicker, but he maintains that both methods are unconstitutional.\n\nZagorski already had a petition pending in a different case. That one claims Zagorski had bad lawyers at trial, resulting in an unfair verdict.\n\nZagorski is scheduled to be executed at 7 p.m. in Nashville\u2019s Riverbend Maximum Security Institution. He was sentenced in 1984 for his convictions in the slayings of two men during a drug deal.\n\n___\n\n5 a.m.\n\nTennessee is scheduled to execute a double-murderer in the electric chair Thursday evening.\n\nIf it goes ahead as scheduled, Edmund Zagorski would be only the second person put to death by electrocution in Tennessee since 1960. Daryl Holton chose to die in the electric chair in 2007.\n\nThe last person to be executed by electrocution in the U.S. was Robert Gleason, who was put to death in Virginia in 2013.\n\nZagorski chose the chair after his legal challenge to Tennessee\u2019s midazolam-based lethal injection protocol failed. His attorneys say he believes death by electrocution would be quicker and less painful, but he maintains that both methods are unconstitutional.\n\nZagorski was sentenced to die in 1984 for the slayings of two men during a drug deal.", "FILE - In this Oct. 28, 2018 file photo, New York Jets running back Isaiah Crowell (20) runs against Chicago Bears linebacker Leonard Floyd (94) during the second half of an NFL football game in Chicago.

Huh, File)\n\nMIAMI (AP) \u2014 When the New York Jets run the ball Sunday, it will be a test of their blocking against the Miami Dolphins\u2019 tackling to see who\u2019s worse.\n\nBoth have been bad lately.\n\nMiami (4-4) has given up 600 yards rushing in the past three games. A defensive decline, not an injury to quarterback Ryan Tannehill , is the biggest reason the Dolphins have lost four of their past five games.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to be better,\u201d safety Reshad Jones said. \u201cBut there\u2019s no time to hit the panic button right now. We\u2019ve got a lot of football left.\u201d\n\nThe Jets (3-5) have averaged 2.8 yards per carry in the past three games while totaling 235 yards. After running back Bilal Powell suffered a season-ending neck injury in Week 7, the ground game generated just 57 yards in last week\u2019s loss at the Chicago Bears.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think it was good at all,\u201d coach Todd Bowles said. \u201cThey beat us up front, and they beat us to the punch.\u201d\n\nSo it looks like an even matchup: the resistible force against the moveable object.\n\nHere are things to know about the 106th meeting between two AFC East rivals sporting two-game losing streaks:\n\nTURF WAR\n\nThe Dolphins are tied for 29th in the NFL in run defense. In the past three weeks, they\u2019ve allowed 164, 248 and 188 yards on the ground, with big plays the biggest problem.\n\n\u201cThere is no secret. There is no magic pill,\u201d five-time Pro Bowl defensive end Cameron Wake said. \u201cEach player has a gap or a man or a zone. You can do it right for 42 plays, and then on play 43 you\u2019re not there, and in this league they\u2019ll find that hole. They\u2019ll find that guy who\u2019s not doing their thing that they\u2019re supposed to be doing. And 80 yards later ...\u201d\n\nThe Jets\u2019 recent rushing woes come after they gashed Denver in Week 5 for 323 yards, second-most in franchise history. Isaiah Crowell had a team-record 219 in that game, but in the past three weeks he has totaled just 94 yards in 37 carries.\n\nThe sputtering ground attack only increases the burden on rookie quarterback Sam Darnold .\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t be up and down,\u201d Bowles said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be consistent at it. If we want to throw the ball consistently, we\u2019ve got to be able to run it consistently.\u201d\n\nSUBSTITUTE\n\nTannehill will miss his fourth game in a row because of an injury to his throwing shoulder. Replacement Brock Osweiler has a slightly better passer rating than Tannehill, with six touchdown throws and three interceptions in three games.\n\nOsweiler passed for 241 yards in last week\u2019s 42-23 loss at Houston and said he\u2019s trying to play so well he doesn\u2019t go back to the bench.\n\n\u201cI had a laundry list of things after the Houston game that I want to clean up,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was really about one page of notes. We have a great coaching staff, and they took that page of notes and turned that into drills \u2014 things I didn\u2019t do right in the game \u2014 in hopes that we can correct those mistakes and make sure that they never happen again.\u201d\n\nCATCH, IF YOU CAN\n\nThe Jets could be shorthanded again at receiver as Robby Anderson and Quincy Enunwa, Darnold\u2019s top targets, are dealing with ankle injuries.\n\nAnderson missed the game at Chicago, and Enunwa has been sidelined the past two games. Without both, New York struggled to get the passing game going against the Bears. Rookie Deontay Burnett, a former teammate of Darnold\u2019s at USC, led the Jets with four catches for 61 yards.\n\n\u201cYou hate to see Robby go down and Q go down, but that means someone\u2019s got to step up,\u201d Darnold said. \u201cIt was cool for him to be able to step up the way that he did.\u201d\n\nFINDING THE END ZONE\n\nRookie tight end Chris Herndon is making catching touchdown passes a weekly thing.\n\nThe fourth-round draft pick out of the University of Miami has scored in each of the past three games, joining receiver Keyshawn Johnson (1996) and tight end Thurlow Cooper (1960) as the only rookies in franchise history to accomplish the feat.\n\nHerndon is also tied with Philadelphia\u2019s Dallas Goedert for the most touchdowns among rookie NFL tight ends with three.\n\nDEJA VU\n\nThe Jets are in a familiar spot at the halfway point, sitting at 3-5 after eight games for the third consecutive year.\n\nThey\u2019re hoping to finish better than they have the last two years, when they ended up 5-11.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Dennis Waszak in Florham Park, New Jersey, contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow Steven Wine on Twitter: http://twitter.com/Steve_Wine\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "DETROIT (AP) \u2014 Dozens of people who said they were victims of sexual assault by doctors at three major universities urged Education Secretary Betsy DeVos to make campuses accountable for investigating abuse allegations in a letter released Thursday.\n\nThe Education Department is considering new guidelines that could change the way allegations are investigated under Title IX of federal civil rights law. DeVos has called for a \u201cmore balanced approach\u201d that respects the rights of the accused, especially students.\n\nThe letter is signed by 80 people who said they were assaulted by doctors Larry Nassar of Michigan State University, George Tyndall of the University of Southern California or the late Richard Strauss of Ohio State University. Nassar is in prison, while Tyndall has denied the allegations and hasn\u2019t been charged with a crime.\n\nThe victims are especially concerned about ordering colleges to allow cross-examination in student-discipline cases involving assault allegations.\n\n\u201cThat should not be the price of coming forward to report abuse,\u201d they wrote. \u201cIf it is, too many survivors would be deterred from moving forward on their complaints.\u201d\n\nA federal appeals court, however, recently said universities must allow some form of cross-examination. The decision applies to schools in Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky and Tennessee after a student who quit rather than face expulsion sued the University of Michigan.\n\nThe victims said universities should be allowed to investigate assaults by students that are alleged to have occurred off campus.\n\nEducation Department spokeswoman Elizabeth Hill said any proposed changes haven\u2019t been released yet.\n\n\u201cI can tell you that the secretary is committed to Title IX reforms that will ensure survivors feel empowered to come forward, all students are afforded due process, universities have clear rules to follow and all institutions that fall short will be held accountable for violations of federal law,\u201d Hill said.\n\nSeparately, the leaders of Princeton University, the University of Wisconsin and Rutgers University wrote a letter to DeVos expressing their \u201cdeep concern\u201d that the government might drop civil rights protections under Title IX for transgender students.\n\n\u201cThis is no time for the country to turn its back on these valued members of our communities,\u201d they wrote.\n\n___\n\nFollow Ed White at http://twitter.com/edwhiteap", "ST.

The Chiefs\u2019 Patrick Mahomes and Cleveland Browns Baker Mayfield will meet on the field as pros for the first time Sunday. Two years ago, the pair squared off in college and combined for more than 1,700 yards. (AP Photo/Orlin Wagner, File)\n\nBEREA, Ohio (AP) \u2014 Back when their chances of playing quarterback in the NFL were still in the dream stages, Patrick Mahomes and Baker Mayfield sat in an apartment near Texas Tech\u2019s campus and played video games.\n\nIt was 2013.\n\nThree years later, they appeared to do the same thing on the field.\n\n\u201cIt was a basketball score,\u201d Mayfield recalled.\n\n\u201cThat game was crazy,\u201d Mahomes said, remembering the October night in 2016 when he and Mayfield re-wrote the NCAA record book.\n\nThe quarterbacks and friends will renew their old rivalry \u2014 and perhaps embark on a new one as pros \u2014 Sunday when Mahomes leads Kansas City and the Chiefs\u2019 high-flying, high-octane offense, into Cleveland to play Mayfield and the Browns, who are again in disarray following the firings this week of coach Hue Jackson and coordinator Todd Haley.\n\nThe previous time they met between the hash marks, Mahomes and Mayfield put on a stunning statistical show unlike anything college football had seen before.\n\nThey combined for 12 touchdown passes, 1,279 yards passing and broke the total yardage mark with 1,708 yards \u2014 854 for each school.\n\nLooking back, Mayfield, who threw seven TD passes to Mahomes\u2019 five and led the Sooners to a 66-59 win, still can\u2019t fathom what happened.\n\n\u201cThat was my \u2018Welcome back to Lubbock\u2019 moment,\u201d said Mayfield, who began his college career as a walk-on at Texas Tech before transferring.\n\n\u201cWeird things happen in Lubbock, Texas, on Saturday nights. It is pretty funny, Oklahoma goes back to Lubbock this weekend and then I am playing Pat on Sunday.\u201d\n\nBrowns defensive coordinator Gregg Williams, who has replaced Jackson as Cleveland\u2019s interim coach, shook his head in disbelief when given details of the Mahomes-Mayfield shootout.\n\n\u201cOh, my gosh,\u201d he said. \u201cSetting defenses back a thousand years.\u201d\n\nNo one \u2014 not even the quarterbacks themselves \u2014 could have envisioned their first meeting five years ago when Mayfield hosted Mahomes on his recruiting trip to Texas Tech would blossom into a friendship and maybe the NFL\u2019s next great QB duel.\n\nMayfield was aware of Mahomes\u2019 background and talent \u2014 son of a major league baseball player, bazooka-like arm \u2014 but then got to know him personally during that weekend visit. What Mayfield quickly learned was that, like him, Mahomes is a natural leader.\n\n\u201cPatrick has always been an easygoing guy,\u201d Mayfield said. \u201cThat is why those teammates he has always had play for him so hard. He gets their respect not just based on talent \u2014 that\u2019s easy to respect \u2014 but based on who he is as a person. He just has that presence about him that you want to be around. You gravitate towards that so it is fun to see him grow.\u201d\n\nAnd my, has Mahomes grown.\n\nThe 22-year-old leads the league with 26 TD passes and 2,526 yards. He threw six TD passes in Week 2 against Pittsburgh, and Mahomes has made as many jaw-dropping, highlight-reel worthy plays this season as many QBs have in a career.\n\nMahomes\u2019 arm strength has drawn rave reviews. Ask any coach, player, scout or reporter who has seen him play about him, and there\u2019s usually a tale about one of his throws.\n\nMayfield said he\u2019s \u201cabsolutely\u201d jealous of Mahomes\u2019 rocket right arm.\n\n\u201cThere was a play in that college game, he was rolling to his left, flicked it and it went about 65 in the air for a touchdown back of the end zone,\u201d Mayfield said, remembering the OU-Texas Tech classic in \u201916. \u201cHe does stuff that you can\u2019t even think of even being possible.\u201d\n\nMayfield was surprised Mahomes wasn\u2019t taken in 2017 with the No. 1 pick, which ended up being Browns defensive end Myles Garrett.\n\n\u201cTalent-wise, I thought he should have been. I love Myles but,\u201d Mayfield said with a smile.\n\n\u201cComing from the Texas Tech system, there are always your skeptics about people doubting the fact that all he did was sit back there and throw the ball. He threw it 88 times in our game, but when it comes down to it, throwing the ball is throwing the ball, and he is really good at it.\u201d\n\nSo is Mayfield.\n\nWhile Mahomes only started one game as a rookie last season, Mayfield was thrust into the lineup in Week 3 when Tyrod Taylor was hurt.\n\nMayfield doesn\u2019t have nearly the same supporting cast as Mahomes, but he\u2019s put up respectable numbers and feels he\u2019s learning with every snap.\n\n\u201cHis talent is through the roof,\u201d Mahomes said of Mayfield. \u201cHe is going to keep getting better every single week. He has already had a lot of success. The sky is the limit for him.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, they\u2019ll go at it again \u2014 pass for pass, play for play \u2014 in what appears to be a mismatch with the Chiefs rolling and the Browns reeling.\n\nBut beyond the score, the NFL could get its first glimpse at a budding QB rivalry. It\u2019s not Tom Brady vs. Peyton Manning, but that one started somewhere too.\n\n\u201cI would absolutely not say that it going to be Brady-Manning right now, but it is humbling to be in that conversation,\u201d Mayfield said.\n\n\u201cIf he keeps playing that way, there is no reason why it would not be on his side of things. Now, I just have to pick up my side and play better.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Latest on charges against a Malaysian financier and two former Goldman Sachs bankers (all times local):\n\n5 p.m.\n\nGoldman Sachs says it is cooperating with the investigation into alleged misuse of money from a Malaysian investment fund created to promote economic development there.\n\nProsecutors said Thursday that former Goldman Sachs banker Tim Leissner pleaded guilty in the scandal.

He said he wanted more cut from the budget and opposed limiting the size of the dividend check.\n\nDuring Thursday\u2019s debate, Dunleavy said he voted against the budget. He did on an initial vote. But when the vote was reconsidered in the Senate, he voted yes. Alaska Public Media reported at the time that Dunleavy said the vote was made in error since he thought it was a procedural vote.\n\nDunleavy left the state Senate in January after five years to focus on the campaign.

(AP Photo/Mark Thiessen)\n\nANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) \u2014 A faith-based women\u2019s homeless shelter in Anchorage is suing to block the city from requiring it to accept transgender women, which it said would violate its religious beliefs.\n\nLawyers for Alliance Defending Freedom filed a motion in federal court Thursday seeking an injunction to stop the city from applying its gender identity law to the Hope Center shelter in Anchorage. The conservative Christian law firm based in Scottsdale, Arizona, says homeless shelters are exempt from the local law, yet the city has used the law to \u201cinvestigate, harass, and pressure\u201d the downtown shelter.\n\n\u201cThe injunction would mean that Anchorage can\u2019t apply the ordinance to the Hope Center in order to force the Hope Center to allow men to come in the shelter and sleep and undress alongside these vulnerable homeless women,\u201d Denise Harle, an attorney with the alliance, said Thursday.\n\nThe shelter operators filed a federal lawsuit against the city and its Equal Rights Commission in August, months after a transgender woman complained to the commission that she was denied entry at the shelter.\n\nBecause the matter is not resolved, Thursday\u2019s filing is premature, and so is the request for injunctive relief, said Deputy Municipal Attorney Deitra Ennis, who represents the city and its Equal Rights Commission in the matter. The commission began an investigation after the transgender woman complained she was denied housing at the shelter.\n\nThe commission\u2019s investigation has not been concluded \u201cdue in large part to the noncooperation of the Hope Center,\u201d Ennis said in a statement provided to The Associated Press. She said the commission had reached no decision or enforcement action before Thursday\u2019s court motion.\n\n\u201cThere is strong federal policy not to intervene in local agency proceedings prior to any enforcement action or state court review of local code interpretation,\u201d she wrote.\n\nThe plaintiffs said the individual identified only as \u201cJessie Doe\u201d showed up inebriated after hours in January and was not turned away because of gender. The shelter officials even paid for a taxicab ride to a local hospital for the individual, who had a forehead wound from fighting at another shelter, to do \u201cthe loving thing\u201d rather than involving police, Harle said. Center officials did not call for an ambulance because the wound did not appear to be an emergency, she said.\n\nThe same individual showed up the following day and again was denied entry, according to Thursday\u2019s motion.\n\nBecause the city continues to pursue the transgender issue, plaintiffs want to the federal court to weigh in and make clear once and for all that nothing the shelter is doing is violating the law, Harle said.\n\nAlliance Defending Freedom also represented a Colorado baker who refused to make a wedding cake for a same-sex couple. In a limited decision, the U.S. Supreme Court sided with the baker, but it did not rule on the larger issue of whether businesses can invoke religious objections to refuse service to gays and lesbians.\n\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center has identified the alliance as an LBGT hate group, one that seeks to push transgender people \u201cback into the shadows.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Rachel D\u2019Oro at https://twitter.com/rdoro", "Vice president to campaign for Rosendale in Kalispell\n\nKALISPELL, Mont.

Without the money to match Newsom\u2019s avalanche of television ads, Cox is looking for free opportunities to reach his supporters.\n\nHe expressed confidence, despite polls showing him with a double-digit deficit.

He\u2019s has largely ignored his rival, focusing his attacks on the president.\n\nWhen he was done handing out candy Wednesday, it was time to the talk to the press. Newsom removed his mask and changed from a Batman T-shirt to a pressed shirt and blue coat, the costume of a politician. He wasn\u2019t keen on the television image of him talking about the serious issues confronting California while dressed like a superhero.\n\n\u201cA bully calls you out, you gotta push back,\u201d he said of Trump. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to be navel gazing. We\u2019re not a small isolated state.

(AP Photo)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 John Dickerson\u2019s election survival strategy involves a shower, some fresh air and maybe \u2014 if he\u2019s lucky \u2014 a short nap.\n\nThe \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d host, along with his three co-hosts, will play a central role in the network\u2019s election night coverage on Tuesday. The broadcast will likely creep into the wee hours, yet each will be expected in the studio for the start of the 7 a.m. morning show.\n\nMorning hosts will help anchor election night on CBS, ABC and NBC. That\u2019s an illustration of how the economics of the television business have changed over the years to where the morning shows are the economic drivers of broadcast news divisions.\n\nThink back to the early 2000s and evening news hosts Tom Brokaw, Peter Jennings and Dan Rather were the unquestioned leaders for their networks on a key news night.\n\nGeorge Stephanopoulos leads the way Tuesday at ABC News, with \u201cWorld News Tonight\u201d anchor David Muir in a support role. \u201cCBS Evening News\u201d anchor Jeff Glor will be outnumbered by the morning team of Dickerson, Gayle King, Norah O\u2019Donnell and Bianna Golodryga. NBC \u201cNightly News\u201d anchor Lester Holt will co-anchor with \u201cToday\u201d show host Savannah Guthrie and Washington bureau chief Chuck Todd.\n\nNot only are morning shows more important to the networks financially, the anchors there have more day-to-day live experience and need to do a greater variety of interviews than their evening counterparts, said news consultant Andrew Tyndall.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a change, but it\u2019s a logical change,\u201d Tyndall said.\n\nBrokaw and Rather came to their jobs with experience as White House correspondents at their networks, which isn\u2019t the case for the evening news anchors today. Stephanopoulos has the most White House experience, but he was working in the Clinton administration, not in the press room, in the early 1990s.\n\nBrokaw next week plans to keep alive his streak of working for NBC News on every presidential or midterm election night since 1966, a streak he started while covering the election of Ronald Reagan as California governor. He\u2019ll be in an elder statesman commentator\u2019s role on Tuesday.\n\nGuthrie won\u2019t be alone working her morning show with little or no shut-eye Wednesday morning. \u201cNo one gets to sleep anyway,\u201d said Rashida Jones, head of planning for NBC\u2019s elections coverage.\n\nDickerson has some experience with the short turnaround since his days as \u201cFace the Nation\u201d host often required him to deliver analysis on both election nights and the morning after.\n\nAdrenaline kicks in, as well as the mild panic of wondering if you\u2019ll have enough time to figure out what the election results mean for the nation going forward, he said. He has to figure out when he\u2019ll have the time to do that.\n\n\u201cThat keeps you going, as well as the ready supply of coffee,\u201d he said.", "This image released by Amazon shows Julia Roberts, left, and Sissy Spacek in a scene from \"Homecoming,\" an Amazon series premiering on Nov. 2. (Hilary B Gayle/Amazon via AP)\n\nTORONTO (AP) \u2014 Julia Roberts and Sissy Spacek, two big-smiling big-screen legends, were remembering the first time they met.\n\nIt was when Roberts, then 13, took a trip to New York to visit her older brother, the actor Eric Roberts, who was making 1981\u2032s \u201cRaggedy Man\u201d with Spacek and her husband, the production designer Jack Fisk.\n\n\u201cI always claimed her,\u201d Spacek said in her bright Texas accent in an interview in September alongside Roberts. \u201cI knew her when she was 13! She was part mine! Lo and behold you are!\u201d\n\nThat their reunion, many decades later, comes on the small screen speaks to how much has changed in the intervening years. The Amazon series \u201cHomecoming,\u201d a psychological thriller directed by Sam Esmail (\u201cMr. Robot\u201d), has drawn plenty of attention because it it\u2019s the first foray into scripted television by Roberts, the megawatt epitome of a movie star if ever there was one. Roberts stars in the series, which premieres Friday, and Spacek plays her mother.\n\nAs long ago as it was, their background together proved helpful.\n\n\u201cThank goodness I met Sissy when I was 13 because when she came in we all had to pinch ourselves,\u201d Roberts says, to which Spacek groans: \u201cOh come on!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is awful to talk like this in front of a person, but it has to be done,\u201d Roberts continues, undeterred. \u201cYou do sit there at a certain point like, \u2018Oh God, that\u2019s Sissy Spacek right next to me.\u2019 Fortunately, the first scene we did on the couch, I don\u2019t ever look at her.\u201d\n\nThe two burst out laughing and a pair of the most infectious cackles you\u2019ve ever heard echo around the room.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s being very gracious,\u201d says Spacek.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just being honest,\u201d retorts Roberts. \u201cTrust me, I\u2019m not that nice.\u201d\n\n\u201cHomecoming,\u201d dense and paranoid, is based on a fictional podcast. Roberts plays a case worker at a remote military facility ostensibly designed to help soldiers reintegrate to civilian life. But dread hovers over the mysterious program, a sense only furthered by flash-forward scenes of Roberts\u2019 character living with her mom and having only foggy recollections of her past.\n\n\u201cI grew up watching television and then there\u2019s a whole period of my life where television was just not on my radar,\u201d says Roberts. \u201cFor me coming in from film, the two things I felt were absolutely critical to me being able to do this, just because of how my creative mind works were: I wanted Sam to direct all the episodes and I wanted all the scripts before we started shooting. I can\u2019t read a map just one little section at a time.\u201d\n\n\u201cBrilliant!\u201d nods Spacek. Figuring out one\u2019s place in a long-format series without the full picture, Spacek says, is like being the bird in the children\u2019s book: \u201cAre you my mommy? Are you my mommy?\u201d\n\nA naturalistic fixture of cinema in the \u201970s (\u201cBadlands,\u201d \u2033Carrie\u201d), \u201980s (\u201cThe Coal Miner\u2019s Daughter,\u201d for which she won an Oscar) and \u201990s (\u201cThe Straight Story\u201d), the 68-year-old Spacek has more regularly dabbled in television. With credits including HBO\u2019s \u201cBig Love,\u201d Netflix\u2019s \u201cBloodline\u201d and Hulu\u2019s \u201cCastle Rock,\u201d she\u2019s a peak-TV veteran.\n\n\u201cIt used to be back in the day that if you were a film actor, you didn\u2019t do TV. And if you did, things weren\u2019t so good,\u201d Spacek says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s all changed, and I love that about it. The veil has lifted. It\u2019s just where there\u2019s great work going on.\u201d\n\nThey are in many ways a fitting pair: Roberts, a Georgia native, and the East Texas-raised Spacek, who lives on a farm in Virginia with Fisk, have both done some of their best work in more rural environs. In Roberts\u2019 case: \u201cErin Brockovich\u201d (her Oscar-winner) and \u201cAugust: Osage County.\u201d\n\nBut Roberts acknowledges \u201cHomecoming\u201d is far from a typical project for her.\n\n\u201cAs much as on paper you would say that Sissy and I would connect, Sam and I on paper aren\u2019t even on the same planet. And yet it was, for me, instantaneous my rapport with Sam,\u201d says Roberts, who credits Esmail with Spacek\u2019s casting. \u201cSissy was the swing-for-the-fences, could-this-ever-happen? I guess Sam just sweet talked you.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe swept me off my feet,\u201d says Spacek. \u201cBut you were the...\u201d\n\n\u201cDangly carrot,\u201d Roberts finishes, with a grin.\n\nNeither Roberts nor Spacek has in any way withdrawn from movies. This fall, Roberts co-stars with Lucas Hedges in the addiction drama \u201cBen Is Back,\u201d and Spacek plays alongside Robert Redford in \u201cThe Old Man & the Gun.\u201d\n\n\u201cGeez, when do you ever not work?\u201d Roberts asks her co-star.\n\n\u201cYou know, you gotta strike while the iron is hot!\u201d answers a cheerful Spacek. \u201cI got a little ragged there for a little while. But when these opportunities come, you\u2019ve got to grab \u2019em.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow AP Film Writer Jake Coyle on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/jakecoyleAP", "Trump: Migrant caravans not \u2018legitimate asylum seekers\u2019; says he wants to limit claims for illegal border crossers", "", "", "", "", "New York Jets quarterback Sam Darnold warms up before an NFL football game against the Chicago Bears Sunday, Oct. 28, 2018, in Chicago. (AP Photo/David Banks)\n\nFLORHAM PARK, N.J. (AP) \u2014 Mike Maccagnan is living in the present \u2014 with an eye on the New York Jets\u2019 future.\n\nThe fourth-year general manager is far from pleased or satisfied with the team\u2019s third straight 3-5 start. He also insists there\u2019s plenty of time left before this season can be accurately judged.\n\nPlayoffs or not, Maccagnan knows this: He and the rest of the franchise believe they\u2019ve got their quarterback in Sam Darnold and the Jets will have plenty of money \u2014 about $100 million \u2014 to build around him during what the GM says will be a \u201cvery active\u201d offseason for the team.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of things in place that with a successful offseason,\u201d Maccagnan said Thursday, \u201cwe can actually put ourselves in a position \u2014 with cap space and cash in free agency, along with our draft picks \u2014 in our mind to really springboard this thing forward.\u201d\n\nMaccagnan\u2019s future with the Jets isn\u2019t a stone-cold lock beyond this season, and neither is that of coach Todd Bowles. New York has a game Sunday at Miami and home against Buffalo next Sunday before taking its bye-week break.\n\nThe Jets might have a good sense of where this season is headed at that point. An eighth straight year without a playoff appearance won\u2019t sit well with fans, and maybe not with owner Christopher Johnson, either.\n\n\u201cWhere Sam Darnold is today is not where he\u2019s going to be a year from now or two years from now,\u201d Maccagnan said. \u201cThe goal is the playoffs. If you don\u2019t make the playoffs, are we moving the team in that direction?\u201d\n\nProgress is the key, and that\u2019s the goal over New York\u2019s final eight games of the regular season. Not that the Jets have chalked up this season to developing Darnold, and wins be damned.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if you go in with the mindset of, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re just going to write this one off,\u2019\u201d Maccagnan said. \u201cWe\u2019re like everybody else: We want to win football games.\u201d\n\nThe Jets haven\u2019t done that consistently enough over the past three years under Maccagnan and Bowles. Part of the issue has been the lack of success in the draft during that span \u2014 with only 13 of 22 picks taken from 2015-17 still on the roster \u2014 despite Maccagnan saying he feels \u201cpretty good\u201d about his selections.\n\nBut this season is different in the sense that New York has Darnold, the No. 3 overall pick who has started from Week 1 and been the anointed face of the franchise since his name was called by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell at the draft in April.\n\nIt has been an up-and-down season for Darnold, whose 10 interceptions are tied for the most in the league. There are spurts of brilliance, though, and a mental approach that has been highly praised by coaches, teammates, opponents and media, along with his natural instincts.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at him from kind of his approach to the game, his work ethic,\u201d Maccagnan said, \u201cit\u2019s something we knew coming in, but obviously watching him kind of handle that situation, handle the locker room, how he approaches it, his passion to be good and his competitiveness, that\u2019s been a really big positive for him.\u201d\n\nSo far, that has been one of the few things Jets fans have been able to feel good about this season.\n\nMaccagnan understands the record isn\u2019t ideal. Neither are the tough losses. Patience, for now, is being preached.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not enjoyable to go out and lose games every week,\u201d Maccagnan said. \u201cI think anybody who has gone through that, or is currently going through that, it\u2019s not a great experience. That\u2019s not what we get paid to do. But I do think that you\u2019re going to have to go through that maturation process at some point in time with the quarterback.\u201d\n\nStill, Maccagnan said the Jets\u2019 focus is trying to win as many games as they can in the second half of the season.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s things that we\u2019re going to go through this season that will help us going forward,\u201d Maccagnan said. \u201cThe idea is that, in the end, our goal is to go out there and compete consistently for the playoffs.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the delicate balance of a GM in Maccagnan\u2019s position: trying to marry the short-term goals with the long-term view for the franchise.\n\n\u201cWhere we are right now, we\u2019re not at the end result yet,\u201d Maccagnan said. \u201cBut we\u2019re in the process where we feel really good about some of the pieces we have and we\u2019re going through a maturation process.\u201d\n\nNOTES: CB Trumaine Johnson (quadriceps) was limited at practice after sitting out team drills the past three weeks.

Hill's first television project post-ESPN addresses three areas she is extremely familiar with: sports, the NBA and politics. Hill is the narrator of \"Shut Up and Dribble,\" a three-part series that debuts on Showtime on Saturday, Nov. 3, 2018, that provides an inside look at the role of athletes in culture and politics through the lens of the NBA. The series executive producer is LeBron James. (Showtime via AP)\n\nJemele Hill\u2019s first couple months since leaving ESPN have been busy. There have been speaking engagements, writing for The Atlantic and starting to set up her own production company.\n\nWhat Hill hasn\u2019t done is appear on television. But that changes on Saturday when Hill debuts as the narrator for the Showtime documentary series \u201cShut Up and Dribble.\u201d The three-part project examines the intersection of three subjects she is extremely familiar with \u2014 basketball, culture and politics.\n\n\u201cIt has been busy (since leaving ESPN) but it also has been exciting and exhilarating,\u201d Hill said. \u201cI like to align myself with people and content that will resonate.\u201d\n\nWhen Hill left her role as a co-host on \u201cSC6\u201d after one year to return to writing, many wondered how long it would be before she left ESPN. Her last day was Sept. 14 after both sides agreed to a buyout.\n\nWhile the \u201cSC6\u201d show with Michael Smith had a different tone compared to other SportsCenter programs, it ended up not being a good fit for all parties and struggled with ratings.\n\n\u201cSportsCenter is SportsCenter. It wasn\u2019t the same as commentary shows,\u201d Hill said. \u201cIt is more of a traditional news program. There wasn\u2019t a lot of wiggle room to inject personality.\u201d\n\nThat is not the case in Hill\u2019s first post-ESPN project. The series is a look at the changing role of NBA players on and off the court over the past 60 years. It is directed by Gotham Chopra. One of the executive producers is LeBron James and his SpringHill Entertainment company.\n\nIt is also the type of series that would likely not appeal to ESPN as network President Jimmy Pitaro has taken a harder line in trying to separate sports from politics. ESPN has strict social media policies to try to discourage its employees from discussing politics.\n\nThis is the first time Hill has narrated a project of this scope. She originally was interviewed for the series about the Pistons and the infamous \u201cMalice in the Palace\u201d brawl against the Indians Pacers, but as the project began to evolve Chopra asked her to take on a bigger role.\n\nESPN approved Hill to be a part of the series, but her role as narrator didn\u2019t happen until after she decided to leave the network.\n\nChopra, whose Religion of Sports series includes Tom Brady and Michael Strahan as executive producers, said this project was initially an exploration of how the NBA became the most culturally and social relevant league in America. As the interaction between current players and President Donald Trump became more heated, it started to take on a different theme.\n\nThe title comes from what Fox News Channel host Laura Ingraham said after she took exception to James\u2019 and Kevin Durant\u2019s criticisms of Trump. According to Chopra, the series\u2019 title and its debut the weekend before the midterm elections are not a coincidence.\n\n\u201cI am a huge sports fan but politics is something I am passionate about,\u201d Chopra said. \u201cIt really is a film about the nexus of sports, politics and social issues.\u201d\n\nJames and Hill are among many in the media and sports who have been subjected to criticism by the White House for being outspoken.

If Tennessee electrocutes Zagorski, it will be in an electric chair built by a self-taught execution expert who is no longer welcome in the prison system. (Tennessee Department of Corrections via AP, File)\n\nNASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 A Tennessee inmate\u2019s final words were \u201clet\u2019s rock\u201d moments before he became the first man executed in the electric chair in that state since 2007, put to death Thursday for shooting two men and slitting their throats during a drug deal decades ago.\n\nEdmund Zagorski, 63, was pronounced dead at 7:26 p.m. Thursday at a Nashville maximum-security prison, officials said.\n\nAsked if he had any last words in the death chamber, the inmate said, \u201cLet\u2019s rock\u201d shortly before the execution was carried out.\n\nA reporter who witnessed the scene said at a post-execution news briefing that Zagorski occasionally smiled while strapped down, just before a sponge was placed on his head and then his face was shrouded. The witnesses said the inmate\u2019s fists then clenched when the electricity was applied and his body appeared to rise. He did not move once the procedure was over.\n\nThe reporter said Zagorski\u2019s attorney was nodding, smiling and tapping her heart just before the execution got underway. When asked about her actions, Kelly Henry, said afterward: \u201cI told him when I put my hand over my heart, that was me holding him in my heart.\u201d\n\nShe said Zagorski told her the last thing he wanted to see was her smiling face, and so she made an effort to smile at him before the shroud was put over his face.\n\nIn opting for the electric chair over a lethal injection as Tennessee allowed him, Zagorski had argued it would be a quicker and less painful way to die. He became only the second person to die in the electric chair in Tennessee since 1960. Nationwide, only 14 other people have been put to death in the electric chair since 2000, including a Virginia inmate in 2013.\n\nThe execution was carried out shortly after the U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday evening denied the inmate\u2019s request for a stay. Zagorski\u2019s attorneys had argued it was unconstitutional to force him to choose between the electric chair and lethal injection.\n\nThe state came close to administering an injection to Zagorski three weeks ago, a plan halted by Tennessee\u2019s governor when Zagorski exercised his right to request the electric chair.\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s statement said Justice Sonia Sotomayor was the dissenting voice on Thursday, noting Zagorski\u2019s difficult decision to opt for the electric chair. In Tennessee, condemned inmates whose crimes occurred before 1999 can choose the electric chair \u2014 one of a handful of states that allow such a choice.\n\n\u201cHe did so not because he thought that it was a humane way to die, but because he thought that the three-drug cocktail that Tennessee had planned to use was even worse,\u201d Sotomayor said in the statement. \u201cGiven what most people think of the electric chair, it\u2019s hard to imagine a more striking testament \u2014 from a person with more at stake \u2014 to the legitimate fears raised by the lethal-injection drugs that Tennessee uses.\u201d\n\nZagorski was convicted of a April 1983 double slaying. Prosecutors said Zagorski shot John Dotson and Jimmy Porter and then slit their throats after robbing the two men after they came to him to buy marijuana.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has never ruled on whether use of the electric chair violates the 8th Amendment ban on cruel and unusual punishment, but it came close about 20 years ago after a series of botched electrocutions in Florida. During two executions in the 1990s smoke and flames shot from the condemned inmates\u2019 heads. In 1999, blood spilled from under an inmate\u2019s mask. Shortly afterward, the Supreme Court agreed to hear a challenge to the electric chair. But the case was dropped when Florida made lethal injection its primary execution method.\n\nRepublican Gov. Bill Haslam declined to intervene in Zagorski\u2019s case despite receiving pleas from former jurors who convicted the inmate, correctional officers and Zagorski\u2019s priest.\n\nAt the time of Zagorski\u2019s conviction, Tennessee juries were not given the option of considering life without parole. Every state now requires juries to weigh that option in death penalty cases.\n\nTennessee\u2019s electric chair was inspected on Oct. 10 and found to meet the criteria for an execution, state documents show.\n\nThe device was originally rebuilt in the late 1980s by a self-taught execution expert who had publicly worried the device would malfunction on Thursday. It\u2019s only been used to execute one person before: Daryl Holton, in 2007.\n\nBefore Holton, the last person to die in Tennessee\u2019s electric chair was William Tines in 1960.\n\nZagorski had been on death row 34 years, the second-longest in Tennessee.\n\nProtesters held vigils Thursday in Knoxville and Memphis, and outside the Nashville maximum-security prison where Zagorski was executed Thursday. There some raised a banner with the words: \u201cA Free Tennessee is Execution-Free.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Travis Loller contributed to this report in Nashville.", "FILE - In this May 24, 2018 file photo, Ainsley Earhardt, co-host of the \"Fox & Friends\" television program, appears on the set in New York.

(AP) \u2014 Republicans trying to defend their majority in Kentucky\u2019s House of Representatives have had to do it with less public help from GOP Gov. Matt Bevin than they have had in the past \u2014 and some of them may prefer it that way.\n\nBevin was everywhere two years ago as he traveled the state stumping for candidates in a year that ultimately saw the GOP win a majority in the House of Representatives for the first time in nearly 100 years. But since then, his approval ratings have declined following critical comments of public school teachers who opposed his pension reforms.\n\nBevin has attended some rallies, including a Shelby County GOP event last week. But his declining presence on the campaign trail this year has been noticeable, especially since he is headed into a re-election campaign in 2019.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been doing a lot more work behind the scenes,\u201d Republican Party of Kentucky spokesman Tres Watson said. \u201cThe best thing he can do for us is what he\u2019s been doing: Spend a lot of time out recruiting new businesses.\u201d\n\nThat \u201cbehind the scenes\u201d work includes helping a political action committee, Kentucky Tomorrow Inc., pay for radio ads in some competitive House districts. The group\u2019s contributors include past Bevin campaign donors Matthew Toebben, Spencer Coates and Charles Price, who is also on the board of directors for Braidy Industries. That company is trying to build an aluminum mill in eastern Kentucky with the help of a $15 million state investment.\n\nEric Lycan, listed as Kentucky Tomorrow\u2019s registered agent and also the general counsel for the Republican Party of Kentucky, did not respond to a phone call and email seeking comment.\n\nKentucky Tomorrow Inc. has run radio ads supporting Republican candidates Josh Calloway in Irvington, Matthew Koch in Paris, Brian Clark in Ashland and Danny Bentley in Russell. They have run ads opposing Democratic candidates Jim Glenn in Owensboro and Jeff Greer in Brandenburg. One ad attacking Greer, an incumbent, referred to him as \u201cGreedy Jeff Greer,\u201d saying he has put \u201cteacher and police retirement benefits at risk by underfunding the state retirement system.\u201d\n\nGreer said he has voted to increase pension funding by expanding gambling and borrowing money, but those bills died in the Republican-controlled Senate.\n\nAsked Thursday about Kentucky Tomorrow, Bevin said his primary focus is to \u201cuse whatever abilities I have and whatever network I have to be able to help people to be elected who will serve the people of Kentucky.\u201d\n\nBevin has focused most of the last two years on making changes to Kentucky\u2019s public pension system, among the worst funded retirement systems in the country.\n\nHis proposals have drawn fierce opposition from public school teachers, frustrating Bevin and his allies. In April, when thousands of teachers closed schools across the state to protest the changes, Bevin said he guaranteed a child had been sexually assaulted that day because they were likely left home alone with no school to go to. He later apologized.\n\nSince then, the Democratic super PAC Kentucky Family Values has been running ads featuring Bevin to criticize Republican incumbents. Dave Cantarino, who runs the group, said Bevin\u2019s unpopularity between the 2016 cycle and the 2018 elections is like the difference between \u201cnight and day.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s unpopular in places where Trump is still very popular. I would say in eastern Kentucky ... you\u2019re seeing 50-point differences between Trump and Bevin,\u201d Cantarino said.\n\nBevin dismissed his poll numbers, telling reporters on Thursday \u201cthey\u2019ve never been high.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have always been way south of 50 percent. And it was immaterial,\u201d he said. \u201cTo focus on those things is a waste of time.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, Bevin traveled to Scott County to announce a long-awaited $26.1 million road project in the district of Republican Rep. Phillip Pratt, who is facing a tough challenge from Democrat Jenny Urie, a history teacher at Owen County High School. Pratt appeared with Bevin and shook his hand but said in an interview he has not asked Bevin to help with his campaign this year.\n\n\u201cThe governor said some things that are inflammatory, make no doubt about that. I have rebuked him on Facebook,\u201d Pratt said. He noted when he campaigns in his district, he often tells voters about his votes to override Bevin\u2019s vetoes. Those include a two-year spending plan approved earlier this year that included a mix of income tax cuts and sales tax increases to help fund public education.\n\nDespite that, Urie has portrayed Pratt as \u201cjust a rubber stamp for Gov. Bevin.\u201d Urie said Bevin is \u201ca huge reason why I filed to run.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe really has a vendetta against public education,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure where that comes from.\u201d\n\nSince Bevin took office, the Republican-controlled legislature has authorized billions of dollars to fund the teachers\u2019 retirement system.

LOUIS (AP) \u2014 St. Louis County election officials are working to notify 600 voters who were mistakenly sent letters telling them they are ineligible to vote on Tuesday.\n\nRepublican election director Rick Stream on Thursday acknowledged the error to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch . Postcards have been sent to the voters, but it\u2019s not certain if they\u2019ll arrive before the election.\n\nStream said the error was the result of confusion by election workers processing voter registrations that arrived after Missouri\u2019s Oct. 10 deadline. The board sent letters to 1,500 voters saying their registrations were received too late for the Nov. 6 election.\n\nThe election workers were unaware that voter registration forms postmarked or signed by Oct. 10 should have counted, regardless of when they arrived. Stream said 600 registrations proved to be valid.\n\nStream said the board of elections discovered the mistake on Oct. 15, revisited all 1,500 letters, and found that 600 of the registrations were, in fact, valid. Of the 600, about 100 voters caught the mistakes themselves and called the elections office to complain, leaving 500 voters who may still believe they are ineligible to vote.\n\nThe problem marked the second in recent weeks involving St. Louis County\u2019s election office. Last month, about 12 percent of county voters received the wrong sample ballots in the mail due to a print vendor\u2019s mistake.

Some argue it detracts from it.\n\nThe troops going to the border areas of Texas, Arizona and California are a small fraction of the military\u2019s roughly 1.3 million active-duty members, and the mission is set to last only 45 days. But many question the wisdom of drawing even several thousand away from training for their key purpose: to win wars.\n\nJames Stavridis, a retired Navy admiral and former head of U.S. Southern Command, said the troops should be preparing for combat and other missions, \u201cnot monitoring a peaceful border\u201d for the arrival of a migrant caravan of several thousand people on foot, still about 900 miles away.\n\n\u201cIt sends a terrible signal to Latin America and the Caribbean as we unnecessarily militarize our border,\u201d Stavridis, who also served as the top NATO commander, said Thursday. \u201cIt places U.S. troops who are fundamentally untrained for the mission of border security and border enforcement into an area of operations, which could cause incidents of a negative character. If we need more border patrol agents, hire them.\u201d\n\nThe first 100 or so active duty troops arrived at the border on Thursday, making initial assessment at the McAllen, Texas, crossing. Overall, there are about 2,600 troops at staging bases in the region.\n\nDavid Lapan, a retired Marine colonel who is a former spokesman for the chairman of the Joint Chiefs and the Department of Homeland Security, said that taking troops away from training and from their families to play a supporting role in border security is unwise.\n\n\u201cIt just doesn\u2019t make any sense,\u201d said Lapan, now a vice president of communications at the Bipartisan Policy Center. \u201cThis caravan, this group of poor people, including a lot of women and children, doesn\u2019t pose a threat \u2014 not a national security threat.\u201d\n\nIn line with the Pentagon\u2019s national security strategy, Mattis has been focused on improving the combat readiness of a military worn down by the recent years of congressionally imposed budget cuts and the grind of 17 years of war in Afghanistan. This includes reorienting training from that required for the smaller wars the U.S. has fought since the 9/11 terrorist attacks to a \u201cgreat power\u201d struggle with Russia and China.\n\nThat context may explain why the Pentagon itself seemed caught off-guard by President Donald Trump\u2019s abrupt order to dispatch active-duty troops; the Customs and Border Patrol, which requested Pentagon help, has struggled to define details of the mission and explain its scope.\n\n\u201cThat this is a security threat is preposterous and not supported by the evidence,\u201d said Derek Chollet, former senior policy adviser at the Pentagon. \u201cIf you\u2019re sitting in the Pentagon and worried about implementation of the national defense strategy and worried about the threats from China and Russia, this is not at the top of your list.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is another version of the parade,\u201d Chollet said, referring to Trump\u2019s demand earlier this year \u2014 eventually withdrawn \u2014 that the military spend millions to stage a parade in Washington D.C. \u201cThis is not a good use of U.S. military resources at this moment. Trump was frustrated in his effort to build a physical wall on the border, now he\u2019s trying to build a human wall by using the U.S. military.\u201d\n\nMattis has rejected assertions that the military is being leveraged by the White House as a political stunt in advance of the midterm elections. \u201cWe don\u2019t do stunts,\u201d he said Wednesday, but neither has he argued that sending thousands of active-duty soldiers to help secure the border is his preference.\n\nGen. Terrence O\u2019Shaughnessy, who as head of U.S. Northern Command is commanding the military operation, dubbed \u201cOperation Faithful Patriot,\u201d has argued that the caravan is a potential threat, although he has not fully defined that.\n\n\u201cI think what we have seen is we\u2019ve seen clearly an organization at a higher level than we\u2019ve seen before,\u201d O\u2019Shaughnessy said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen violence coming out of the caravan and we\u2019ve seen as they\u2019ve passed other international borders, we\u2019ve seen them behave in a nature that has not been what we\u2019ve seen in the past.\u201d\n\nOne concern raised by other defense officials is that the caravans are largely male-dominated, and that one of them used violence when crossing the border into Mexico. But Associated Press journalists traveling with the largest group say it includes many families, including hundreds of children, and it has been orderly and peaceful, with no sign of any danger.\n\nThe military says it is deploying 7,000 troops to Texas, Arizona and California, and while it has left open the possibility that the number could grow by another thousand under current plans, the scope of the mission has grown in recent days. On Wednesday, President Donald Trump said he would send as many as 15,000 troops.\n\nSen. Jack Reed, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in a letter to Trump on Thursday that his administration has given the committee no evidence that migrant caravans pose a direct security threat to the U.S.\n\n\u201cThis is not a military problem; it does not warrant a military solution,\u201d Reed wrote. He said the administration should disclose the cost of the military\u2019s border mission \u201cand what impacts it will have on military readiness and the overall budget.\u201d\n\nWith his eyes squarely on Tuesday\u2019s election contests, Trump has rushed a series of immigration declarations, promises and actions as he tries to mobilize supporters to retain Republican control of Congress. His own campaign in 2016 concentrated on border fears, and that\u2019s his focus in the final days of the midterm fight.\n\nTrump has railed against illegal immigration, focusing on the migrant caravans that have been going on for several years but received little attention until now. The largest at the moment consists of about 4,000, down from a high of about 7,000, and is still in southern Mexico. Several smaller groups, estimated at a combined 1,200 people, are farther away.", "MERIDIAN, Idaho (AP) \u2014 A Meridian police officer who fatally shot a man has been cleared of wrongdoing in the shooting.\n\nThe Meridian Police Department said Wednesday that Twin Falls County prosecuting attorney Grant Loebs cleared Officer Kyle Mikowski in the July 1 shooting of Meridian resident Daniel Norris.\n\nMikowski shot and killed Norris during a shootout with Meridian police.

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives declined to release tracking information on guns associated with crimes, so the AP collected that information from individual agencies and compared it with its own database to find firearms with matching make, model, caliber and serial numbers.\n\nBelow are details about guns sold by law enforcement that were later picked up at crime scenes:\n\nBABY SHOT IN CAR SEAT\n\nThe Washington State Patrol traded a batch of crime guns with a firearms dealer in June 2010. The batch included a Lorcin L380 semi-automatic pistol. In April 2015, a gang member shot at a car carrying a couple and their year-old daughter. One of the bullets hit the child in the head and killed her. While searching a home frequented by the suspected shooter and many other gang members, the Kent Police Department found a Lorcin L380 semi-automatic pistol \u2014 the gun sold by the State Patrol.\n\nTEXT THREATS\n\nThe Pierce County Sheriff\u2019s Office in April 2014 sold a list of guns at auction that included a Mossberg 12-gauge shotgun. In October 2016, Jaylen Bolar sent text messages to his mother, threatening to kill her and others. Angela Almo contacted a behavioral health center instead of the police because she knew her son had firearms, including a Mossberg 12-gauge shotgun and she feared he\u2019d be killed in a standoff with authorities.\n\nWhen the Tacoma police became involved, he denied it, but his aunt confirmed that she, too, had received threats. Robin Olson showed an officer her phone, which contained a message from Bolar asking his uncle to kill him because he was tired of living.\n\nBolar also threatened to kill a woman who used to be his boss. He was taken into custody, and a search of his home found two firearms in his bedroom. One was the Mossberg shotgun sold by the sheriff\u2019s office.\n\nJUVENILES IN STOLEN CAR\n\nThe Aberdeen Police Department sold a Lorcin Model L380 pistol in February 2011. In May 2016, the Kent Police Department located a stolen vehicle parked at the Benson Village Apartments and found a gun under the seat \u2014 the Lorcin Model L380 pistol sold by Aberdeen police. The three juveniles who stole the car were convicted felons.\n\nDRUNKEN FELON\n\nThe Kitsap County Sheriff\u2019s Office sold a Hi Point 9mm pistol in March 2014. In October 2015, the Snohomish County Sheriff\u2019s Office responded to a 911 call from a woman who said she heard what she thought was a gunshot and went outside to find her daughter\u2019s intoxicated boyfriend passed out on the front porch. When deputies arrived, they found a handgun, the Hi Point 9 mm pistol, on the ground next to the man. It was the gun sold by the Kitsap sheriff\u2019s office. A search found that the man was a convicted felon who wasn\u2019t permitted to have a gun. The deputy put the man in handcuffs and called for medical help.\n\nPROHIBITED FROM HAVING GUN\n\nThe Washington State Patrol traded a Lorcin L380 semi-automatic pistol with a firearms dealer in June 2010. In May 2015, the Kent Police Department was investigating a 911 call and encountered four people outside the house. One of the men was prohibited from having a gun, but they found he was carrying a handgun, the Lorcin L380 semi-automatic pistol sold by the State Patrol. The gun had been reported stolen, and he was arrested.\n\nDRUG HOUSE ASSAULT\n\nThe Aberdeen Police Department traded a JC Higgins .22-caliber rifle with a firearms dealer in February 2011. In April 2015, the Yakima Police Department responded to a domestic violence assault involving a JC Higgins .22-caliber rifle with the same serial number. The dispute involved an elderly man who had handled his wife roughly and threatened her sister. The man was charged, and police took his firearm. In October 2015, Kent police searched a suspected drug house and arrested several people wanted on felony warrants. They found a .22 caliber rifle \u2014 the JC Higgins rifle sold by the Aberdeen police.\n\nFACEBOOK POSTS ABOUT KILLING\n\nThe Thurston County Narcotics Task Force sold a Smith & Wesson pistol in August 2012. In October 2013, the Tacoma Police went to the University of Washington, Tacoma to investigate a report of a student who was posting photos of a gun on Facebook and said he had \u201cvivid, colorful dreams of shooting and killing lots of people last night.\u201d Police found in his backpack a Smith and Wesson pistol, the one sold by the narcotics task force.\n\nCOCAINE PARTY FAVORS\n\nThe Bonney Lake Police Department in March 2011 traded a Davis Industries .380-caliber handgun with a firearms dealer who sold it to the public. In February 2012, Kent police stopped a man for an expired registration and discovered baggies of cocaine in his car. He said they were party favors. They also found his concealed handgun, the firearm sold by the police.\n\nTHREATS TO KILL\n\nLongview Police Department sold a Davis Industries.22 caliber pistol in August 2016. The Thurston County Sheriff\u2019s Office responded to a 911 call in April 2017 from a man who said his father headed to a house with a gun and planned to threaten the occupants. Jesse Brown threatened to kill the men who lived there and was arrested. Officers confiscated his Davis Industries .22 caliber pistol \u2014 the one sold by Longview police \u2014 and 15 other firearms.\n\nDRUNKEN FATHER\n\nThe Thurston County Sheriff\u2019s Office sold a Mossberg, Model 590, 12-gauge shotgun in December 2014. In March 2016, the Tacoma police responded to a call by a 12-year-old girl who said she and her sister fled their home because their father was drunk and was threatening to shoot his girlfriend and threatening to beat up one of the girls because he couldn\u2019t find his gun. The police later found a Mossberg, Model 590, 12-gauge shotgun \u2014 the gun sold by the Sheriff\u2019s Office \u2014 in the bathtub.\n\nMAN\u2019S SUICIDE\n\nThe Washington State Patrol traded a batch of guns to a firearms vendor in June 2010 that included a Smith and Wesson .9mm handgun. In September 2014, the Yakima Police Department responded to a report of a suicidal man with a gun. They arrived to find 24-year-old Kyle Juhl with a gunshot wound to the head. He used a Smith and Wesson .9mm handgun, the one sold by the State Patrol.\n\nMENTAL HEALTH EMERGENCY\n\nThe Thurston County Narcotics Task Force sold a Springfield Armory .40-caliber pistol in December 2013. In February 2014, the Seattle Police Department helped take firearms from a man who was having a mental health emergency and was at the Involuntary Treatment Act court.

(AP Photo/Elaine Thompson, File)\n\nSEATTLE (AP) \u2014 The Spokane, Washington, City Council is considering a proposal to stop the police department from selling forfeited firearms, following an Associated Press investigation found that guns sold by Washington state law enforcement agencies were later used in new crimes.\n\nCouncilwoman Candace Mumm said Thursday that the AP investigation coupled with a review of the proceeds from the gun sales inspired the council to want to end the practice.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re putting assault weapons back into the community,\u201d Mumm said. \u201cI felt the benefit of destroying them outweighed the costs.\u201d\n\nUnder state law, police and sheriff\u2019s departments have the option to sell, destroy or trade firearms confiscated in criminal investigations, but the law requires the Washington State Patrol to sell the guns. All sales are conducted through a federally licensed gun dealer.\n\nThe Spokane Police Department has sold 311 since 2011, according to spokesman Officer John O\u2019Brien. The AP investigation went back to 2010, which included 25, bringing Spokane\u2019s total to 336 since 2010.\n\nThe department sells its confiscated long guns through an auction house located across the border in Post Falls, Idaho, he said. The agency won\u2019t sell any guns used in homicides or illegal firearms like automatic weapons. They destroy forfeited handguns, he said.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies across Washington state sold more than 6,000 firearms that had been used in crimes between 2010 and the end of 2017, the AP investigation found. More than a dozen of those weapons later turned up in new criminal investigations, according to a yearlong AP analysis that used hundreds of public records to compare serial numbers of sold guns with crime guns.\n\nThe guns sold by police , sheriff\u2019s offices and the Washington State Patrol were used to threaten people, seized at gang hangouts, discovered in drug houses, possessed illegally by convicted felons, found in a stolen car, taken from a man suffering from a mental health crisis and used in a suicide .\n\nThe guns sold by Spokane police included Winchester .22-caliber rifles, Remington 12-gauge shotguns, a Colt AR-15, a Bulgarian-made AK47-style rifle, a \u201cRomar assault rifle\u201d and several Norinco SKS, 7.62 x 39 mm semi-automatic rifles. One of the Norincos sold for $180, according to police records on the sales.\n\nBetween 2011 and 2018, the forfeited firearms sales generated $16,787, according to the proposed ordinance. The sales ranged from $633 to about $7,488 in any given year, the ordinance said.\n\nBut when the handling costs related to the sales -- records, accounting, transfer fees, taxes -- are factored in, the sales only brought in several thousand dollars, said Mumm, the councilwoman who is sponsoring the new ordinance. Each law enforcement agency must pay 10 percent of all sales to the Washington State Treasurer.\n\nMumm said she has received emails from some who think the revenue is worth it, \u201cbut I\u2019m also hearing from people asking \u2018why are they selling assault rifles?\u2019\u201d\n\nFresh in the city council\u2019s mind, she said, was the shooting at Freeman High School in September 2017. A student brought a semi-automatic rifle and handgun to the school, located southeast of Spokane, and killed one student and injured three others.\n\nAccording to the ordinance: \u201cthe City of Spokane intends to do all it can to prevent and reduce violent crime in Spokane and has determined that destroying all seized or forfeited firearms rather than reselling them to the public or to gun dealers is a simple, sensible and effective way to reduce access to firearms and help reduce and prevent gun violence.\u201d\n\nThe City Council is scheduled to hear public comment on the ordinance before voting on the measure next Monday night.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been updated to correct the number of guns sold by the Spokane Police Department was 336.", "1 of 2 FILE - In this Nov. 25, 2017, file photo, Connecticut head coach Randy Edsall argues a call during the first half of an NCAA college football game against Cincinnati, in Cincinnati.

We look forward to moving on.\u201d\n\nThe ethics board\u2019s ruling led to a change in state law allowing immediate family members to work in the same department within the higher education system under certain conditions.\n\nThe ethics board did not immediately return calls and emails Thursday seeking comment.\n\nThe elder Edsall is in his second stint as UConn\u2019s football coach.

(AP Photo/Richard Drew, File)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 History is likely to be made in the race for New York Attorney General next Tuesday. Either of the major party candidates would be the state\u2019s first black attorney general. One, Democrat Letitia James, would be the first black woman elected to statewide office in New York.\n\nThe race between James, a Brooklyn native in her second term as New York City\u2019s public advocate, and Republican Keith Wofford, a New York City lawyer, was set up by the unexpected resignation last May of Attorney General Eric Schneiderman in a #MeToo reckoning.\n\nHis downfall was lightning fast. A New Yorker expose revealed that four women had accused Schneiderman \u2014 a longtime enemy of President Donald Trump \u2014 of physical abuse. Hours after its publication, the Democrat quit office.\n\nAt the time, James, 60, said she was plotting a possible future campaign for New York City mayor. She said she was initially hesitant to enter the race, even as fellow Democrats were floating her name as a candidate, but decided to jump in after a neighbor asked for help navigating President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration policies.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not here to make history. I\u2019m here to get things done,\u201d James said in a recent interview with The Associated Press, though she said personal experiences with discrimination, including people hurling racial epithets or questioning her credentials, give her a different perspective than others who have held the office.\n\nWofford, a political newcomer originally from Buffalo, said he saw Schneiderman\u2019s downfall as an \u201cinflection point\u201d and entered the race with hopes of using the office to fight political corruption and give working class families, like the ones he and James were raised in, a fairer shake.\n\nThere has been an approach that has allowed politicians to repeatedly steal or make public decisions based on their private political and personal political interest,\u201d Wofford said. \u201cIt\u2019s happened basically with impunity.\u201d\n\nJames emerged from a hotly contested, four-way Democratic primary in September for the right to face Wofford in the general election.\n\nThe race has turned partly on the role of the state attorney general\u2019s office in fighting the Trump administration.\n\nJames said she would continue the state\u2019s pending lawsuits challenging several Trump policies on immigration, the environment and other topics, and accusing the president\u2019s charitable foundation of breaking the law.\n\nWofford said he\u2019ll only pursue Trump-related cases that benefit the state or residents and wouldn\u2019t necessarily sign on to multi-state campaigns or lawsuits that are predominantly political or designed to \u201cexpress political dissatisfaction or resistance for resistance\u2019s sake.\u201d\n\nBoth candidates have working class roots.\n\nJames grew up in Brooklyn with seven siblings. Her parents were maintenance workers. Wofford\u2019s father worked in an automobile factory near Buffalo for three decades and they\u2019d spend fall and winter Sundays listening to Bills games on the radio.\n\nWofford, 49, said becoming the state\u2019s first black attorney general would send a signal to \u201ckids like me that there\u2019s a trajectory for you in life and a fairness at the heart of our law enforcement system.\u201d\n\nJames said she wants to use her office\u2019s regulatory powers to prevent foreclosures and home abandonment by having legal services lawyers work with homeowners embedded in the attorney general\u2019s office.\n\nShe said she would also expand on the \u201cworst landlords\u201d list she introduced as public advocate by taking action against slumlords statewide.\n\n\u201cConditions that threaten the life and safety of tenants \u2014 low-income tenants and tenants of color in particular \u2014 will not be tolerated,\u201d James said.\n\nBoth candidates say they\u2019ll be tough on political corruption.\n\nMore than 30 state lawmakers alone have left office facing allegations of misconduct since 2000, including a former Democratic assembly speaker and a former Republican senate majority leader.\n\nNancy Sliwa, of the Reform Party and Michael Sussman, of the Green Party, are also on the ballot. Patent attorney Christopher Garvey, 68, of Amityville, is the Libertarian Party candidate.\n\nThe attorney general appointed to replace Schneiderman, Barbara Underwood, declined to run for the office but said she would take up an offer to stay on some capacity if James wins.

Charles Baker, Thursday, Nov. 1, 2018 in Needham, Mass. (Jim Davis/The Boston Globe via AP, Pool)\n\nBOSTON (AP) \u2014 Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker worked to fend off attacks from his Democratic challenger, Jay Gonzalez, in their final debate of the election Thursday.\n\nOne politician not on the ballot hovered over the televised head-to-head match, Republican President Donald Trump.\n\nGonzalez faulted the Republican governor for not speaking out forcefully enough against Trump after the two were asked a question about the weekend attack on a Pittsburgh synagogue that left 11 people dead.\n\n\u201cThe tragedy in Pittsburgh was a despicable act of hate and violence and our president is inciting this type of conduct with his hateful and divisive language,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cWe need public officials who are going to stand up forcefully against it.\u201d\n\nBaker worked to put as much distance as he could between his campaign and his party\u2019s top national office-holder, saying he didn\u2019t vote for Trump in 2016 and doesn\u2019t plan to vote for him if he runs for re-election.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve stood up and spoken out against the president on numerous occasions because his language in many cases is destructive and appalling,\u201d Baker said, highlighting his administration\u2019s efforts to combat hate crimes in Massachusetts.\n\nDuring the debate \u2014 which ranged from discussions about the gas explosions in the Merrimack Valley to the state\u2019s ongoing housing crunch \u2014 Baker repeatedly criticized a proposal by Gonzalez to raise $3 billion in extra revenue, calling it tenuous at best and saying it wouldn\u2019t go nearly far enough to pay for all of the Democrat\u2019s proposals.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s spent that $3 billion five times since this debate started.\u201d Baker said. \u201cIt\u2019s dishonest.\u201d\n\nGonzalez has proposed taxing the endowments of the state\u2019s wealthiest colleges and universities like Harvard University and MIT and imposing a surtax of 4 percent on any portion of an individual\u2019s annual income that exceeds $1 million.\n\nTogether, the plans would eventually bring in about $3 billion in extra revenue annually, Gonzalez said.\n\n\u201cIt is $3 billion more than zero, which is his plan,\u201d Gonzalez said.\n\nGonzalez also tried to tie Baker to more conservative Republican candidates running for office in Massachusetts, including Senate candidate state Rep. Geoff Diehl - who is hoping to unseat Democratic incumbent U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren - and GOP candidate Jay McMahon, who is challenging Democratic state Attorney General Maura Healey.\n\nWhen pressed on his support for the two candidates, who hold more conservative positions than he does, Baker said he had promised to support the Republican ticket in Massachusetts.\n\nDuring the debate, Baker more than once pointed to instances where he had worked with Healey and Warren on key issues.\n\nGonzalez pressed Baker on his support for Diehl and McMahon.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s blindly supporting the Republican ticket no matter the consequences,\u201d Gonzalez said.\n\nBoth candidates outlined their plans to bring internet broadband to western Massachusetts communities without access, help expand housing opportunities in the face of soaring home costs, and expand the state\u2019s reliance on renewable sources of energy, including offshore wind, solar and hydropower.\n\nAsked to name a personal hero, Gonzalez named former Democratic Gov. Deval Patrick. Gonzalez worked under Patrick as his budget chief.\n\nBaker named Abraham Lincoln.\n\nBaker is running for a second four-year term as the top office-holder in a state where Republicans make up a small fraction of the total voting population.

(Brett Coomer/Houston Chronicle via AP)\n\nDENVER (AP) \u2014 The Denver Broncos may have lost a respected voice when they traded former captain Demaryius Thomas to the Houston Texans on Tuesday, but they certainly didn\u2019t lose any of their gift of gab.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t flinch from situations like this,\u201d declared rookie receiver Courtland Sutton , whose emergence as a big-play threat made the 30-year-old Thomas more valuable to general manager John Elway as trade bait than a tutor.\n\nBroncos cornerback Chris Harris Jr., who credited Thomas with helping to make him the superstar he\u2019s become, will spend Sunday trying to snarl DeAndre Hopkins when the Broncos (3-5) host the Texans (5-3) in Thomas\u2019 hurried homecoming.\n\nIf Harris finds himself covering Thomas, who\u2019s replacing Will Fuller (ACL) in the Texans\u2019 lineup, the advantage goes to ...\n\n\u201cOh, me,\u201d Harris said matter-of-factly.\n\nWhy\u2019s that?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m that good.\u201d\n\nThe same can\u2019t be said for the Broncos overall.\n\nThey\u2019ve lost five of six despite a backfield that\u2019s the best in the business, averaging an NFL-high 5.3 yards per carry but just 18th in rush attempts per game.\n\nOffensive coordinator Bill Musgrave is doing what Mike McCoy did in Denver before getting fired last year: spreading out the offensive formations despite a good ground game and left tackle Garett Bolles\u2019 holding habit.\n\nCase Keenum has been sacked 22 times, 20 of which have come with him in the shotgun, to go with a league-high 10 interceptions.\n\nDefensively, the Broncos have been stumped by cornerback Bradley Roby\u2019s slide after his promotion from nickel back following the trade of Aqib Talib. In a contract year, they expected him to flourish as a starter. Instead, he\u2019s been giving his man too much cushion or getting fooled by quarterbacks burning him for big plays.\n\nMiddling drafts prior to this year\u2019s crescendo has left coach Vance Joseph (8-16) without the option of benching Bolles or Roby, although cornerback Tramaine Brock\u2019s return from a pulled hamstring and solid play over the past two weeks could foretell a return to some nickel back snaps for Roby.\n\nElway insists the Broncos can turn things around over the second half and avoid the franchise\u2019s first back-to-back losing seasons since 1971-72.\n\nIf not, Joseph could be out of a job.\n\nTexans coach Bill O\u2019Brien was feeling the heat himself before J.J. Watt and DeShaun Watson rounded into form, leading Houston on a five-game winning streak, something only four other teams in the Super Bowl era have done after starting 0-3.\n\nThe Texans were devastated last week when receiver Will Fuller (32 catches, 503 yards, 4 TDs) tore an ACL, ending his season.\n\nEnter Thomas (36 catches, 402 yards, three TDs) .\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be great\u201d having Thomas alongside Hopkins, Watson said. \u201cNothing really should stop the train. D.T.\u2019s a veteran guy that can do a lot of different things and he\u2019s played a lot football. So it\u2019s a great opportunity for all of us to get on the same page and continue to put a lot yards in the air and put a lot points on the board.\u201d\n\nOther subplots Sunday when Thomas returns to Denver for his first look at the visitor\u2019s locker room and gets a peek at the \u201cThank you\u201d banner being added to his 10-story-high image on the north side of Mile High Stadium:\n\nKEENUM-O\u2019BRIEN\n\nKeenum and O\u2019Brien are mutual admirers, but they have a different view of their brief time together in Houston.\n\nIn his book, Keenum wrote that when the Texans signed Ryan Mallet and cut him, \u201cCoach O\u2019Brien looked right at me and told me I\u2019d never be more than a third-string quarterback in the NFL.\u201d\n\nNot so, said O\u2019Brien.\n\n\u201cIn all my years of coaching, I\u2019ve never said anything like that to any player,\u201d O\u2019Brien said, adding, \u201cI have a great, great amount of respect for Case Keenum.\u201d\n\nKeenum didn\u2019t back down, saying he \u201coutlined it in my book,\u201d but he did return the praise.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got so much respect for Coach O\u2019Brien. I learned so much ball from him, just how to study defenses, what type of leverages and coverages, just dissecting defenses. He taught me so much ball,\u201d Keenum said.\n\n\u201cWhatever it was that was said motivated me. Every coach I\u2019ve ever had, they\u2019ve gotten me to where I am now. I\u2019ve got the utmost respect for him and the whole Texans organization.\u201d\n\nWATT A COMEBACK\n\nWatt has shaken off two years of injuries to return to superstardom with eight sacks, 10 tackles for loss, 13 quarterback hits and four forced fumbles. He\u2019s started all eight games this season after playing in just eight games combined over the previous two seasons because of a bad back and a broken leg.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t sit here and get too mad at people who thought I might be washed up or thought I might be done because I was sitting in that same boat when I was sitting at home with a cast on my leg and not being able to walk, thinking, \u2018Man, will I be the same again?\u2019\u201d Watt said.\n\n\u201cI still don\u2019t think I\u2019m there yet. I still think I\u2019m working and trying to get back there, but it\u2019s been fun to play, it\u2019s been fun to win, it\u2019s been fun to just go out there and make some plays.\u201d\n\nYOUTH SERVED\n\nSutton isn\u2019t the only Broncos rookie making a huge impact. Edge rusher Bradley Chubb , the No. 5 overall pick in the draft, leads all rookies with seven sacks and is won Defensive Rookie of the Month honors for October. Undrafted running back Phillip Lindsay leads all rookies with 531 yards rushing.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\n___\n\nFollow Arnie Melendrez Stapleton on Twitter: http://twitter.com/arniestapleton", "ST.

(AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump is spreading misleading rhetoric about the nature of Central American migrants heading to the U.S. border and grossly inflating the number of immigrants living in the U.S. illegally.\n\nIn a speech Thursday, he suggested without evidence that the migrant caravans are full of hardened criminals; in fact, they are mostly poor people with few belongings who are fleeing gang violence.\n\nIn stressing that his administration will not allow a \u201ccatch and release\u201d policy, Trump also claimed this week that 25 million to 30 million immigrants now live in the country illegally because previous administrations had \u201creleased\u201d immigrants in the U.S. after they had been caught crossing the border as they awaited immigration hearings.\n\nHe\u2019s wrong. Independent estimates put the number of people in the U.S. illegally at less than half that amount.\n\nA look at his various claims on immigration:\n\nTRUMP: \u201cAt this very moment, large well-organized caravans of migrants are marching towards our southern border. Some people call it an invasion. ...These are tough people in many cases; a lot of young men, strong men and a lot of men that maybe we don\u2019t want in our country. ...This isn\u2019t an innocent group of people. It\u2019s a large number of people that are tough. They have injured, they have attacked.\u201d \u2014 immigration speech Thursday.\n\nTHE FACTS: He suggests without evidence that people in the caravans are, by and large, dangerous, hardened criminals.\n\nThe migrants in the caravans are mostly from Honduras, where it started, as well as El Salvador and Guatemala. Overall, they are poor, carrying the belongings that fit into a knapsack and fleeing gang violence or poverty.\n\nIt might be true there are some criminals mixed in with the throngs, given the sheer number of migrants. Trump did not substantiate his claim that members of the MS-13 gang, in particular, are among them.\n\nSome migrants in one of the caravans clashed with Mexican police at the Mexico-Guatemala border, hurling stones and other objects as they tried to cross the international bridge. One migrant died; it\u2019s not clear how it happened. Caravan leaders said they had expelled a number of troublemakers from the procession, exhibiting some self-policing. Ultimately, most entered Guatemala \u2014 and later, Mexico \u2014 by illegally bypassing immigration checkpoints.\n\nThe caravan otherwise has been overwhelmingly peaceful, receiving applause and donated food from residents of the towns they pass. Mexican police have not tried again to stop them.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP: \u201cPresident Obama separated the children from parents and nobody complained. When we continued the exact same law, the country went crazy.\u201d \u2014 immigration speech Thursday.\n\nTHE FACTS: Actually, President Barack Obama did not do the same thing as a matter of policy.\n\nWhile it\u2019s true the underlying laws were the same, the Trump administration mandated anyone caught crossing the border illegally was to be criminally prosecuted. That policy meant adults were taken to court for criminal proceedings, and their children were separated and sent into the care of the Health and Human Services Department, which is tasked with caring for unaccompanied migrant children. The so-called zero tolerance policy remains in effect, but Trump signed an executive order June 20 that stopped separations.\n\nJeh Johnson, Obama\u2019s homeland security secretary, recently told NPR there may have been unusual or emergency circumstances when children were taken from parents, but there was no such policy.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP: \u201cAsylum is not a program for those living in poverty.\u201d \u2014 speech Thursday.\n\nTHE FACTS: He\u2019s largely right. Poverty may play a role in the complex decision process granting asylum, but the status is reserved for people who have a justifiable fear of persecution in their own country based on factors such as their race, religion or political views. According to the Homeland Security Department, about 20 percent of claimants are granted asylum. Currently, there is a backlog of about 700,000 cases, and it can take years for claims to get resolved.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP: \u201cWe\u2019re not doing releases. What\u2019s been happening over years is they would come in, release them, and they would never show up for their trial. And we now have 25 or 30 million people in this country illegally, because of what\u2019s been happening over many years.\u201d \u2014 remarks Wednesday to reporters.\n\nTHE FACTS: It\u2019s nowhere close to 25 million to 30 million, nor has the number increased much in recent years.\n\nThe nonpartisan Pew Research Center estimates there were about 11.3 million immigrants in the U.S. illegally in 2016, the most recent data available. That number is basically unchanged from 2009.\n\nThe number of such immigrants had reached a height of 12.2 million in 2007, representing about 4 percent of the U.S. population, before declining due in part to a weakening U.S. economy.\n\n___\n\nFind AP Fact Checks at http://apne.ws/2kbx8bd\n\nFollow @APFactCheck on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APFactCheck", "PROVIDENCE, R.I.

But her home lacks what most of the country considers basic necessities: electric lines and running water.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been that way my whole life, almost 31 years,\u201d she said at the jewelry stand she and her husband run with pride in Monument Valley, a rural community near the Utah-Arizona border where tourists stand in the highway to re-create a famous running scene from \u201cForest Gump.\u201d\n\nAs she decides how she\u2019ll cast her ballot, Navajo voters like Nakai could tip the balance of power in their county on Nov. 6. It\u2019s the first general election since a federal judge decided racially gerrymandered districts illegally minimized the voices of Navajo voters who make a slim majority of San Juan County\u2019s population. The county overlaps with the Navajo Nation, where people face huge disparities in health, education and economics. About 40 percent lack running water in their homes.\n\nThe race highlights the simmering tensions between Native Americans and white residents who live across the San Juan River on ranches and in towns laid out in neat grids by Mormon settlers. Though county leaders acknowledge the historical inequities Navajo people face, they say those issues go far beyond their reach.\n\nWillie Grayeyes disagrees. After a fight to get on the ballot, the Democratic County Commission candidate is running in a new district and wants to help address needs like basic utilities and neglected dirt roads that tear up buses and can wash out in storms, keeping students out of school.\n\nOverlapping county, federal and tribal governments mean it\u2019s not always clear who is responsible for any given problem. But if Grayeyes wins, the county\u2019s governing body will be majority Navajo for the first time.\n\n\u201cI want to sit at the table ... rather than, \u2018There\u2019s an Indian sitting over there. Let\u2019s see what he says,\u2019\u201d he said at a meeting last week. \u201cLong term, I want to change the things, the beliefs that separate us \u2014 dominant society vs. Native American communities.\u201d\n\nTribes also have been fighting for increased access to the ballot box in Nevada, Alaska and North Dakota, where a U.S. Supreme Court decision last month allows the state to keep requirements that Native Americans said were discriminatory.\n\nUtah\u2019s San Juan County is a southwestern landscape of rolling green sage and red mesas that covers an area nearly the size of New Jersey. It includes Monument Valley and a handful of other primarily Democratic communities on the Navajo Nation, which also sprawls into Arizona and New Mexico. The county\u2019s larger, mostly non-Native towns of Blanding and Monticello are heavily Republican.\n\nThe county faced a voting-rights case in the 1980s, and more recently a federal judge decided its three commission districts were drawn so only one member would be Navajo. The county is appealing that ruling as unfair to Blanding voters.\n\nGrayeyes is running in a new, 65 percent Navajo district against Kelly Laws, a Republican former Blanding city councilman whose son is the county attorney. It\u2019s the county\u2019s only contested commission race this year. Laws didn\u2019t return messages from The Associated Press seeking comment.\n\nA Grayeyes win would also change the county\u2019s position in the still-fresh debate over Bears Ears National Monument, land that tribes consider sacred.\n\nMany of the county\u2019s non-Native residents were angry when President Barack Obama created the monument. They argue the added protections on 2,100 square miles (5,400 square kilometers) were too broad and closed the area to energy development. They cheered President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to downsize Bears Ears by about 85 percent.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been very divisive,\u201d said Bruce Adams, the commission\u2019s Republican chairman, who is running unopposed for another term.\n\nHe acknowledges the steep contrast between life in his hometown and conditions on the Navajo Nation, but said it\u2019s wrong to lay all the problems at the feet of county government.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve tried to treat these people just like we treat everyone in San Juan County. They\u2019re no different to us than any other citizen,\u201d Adams said.\n\nNavajos in the county do face unique challenges getting to the ballot box. Many homes lack traditional street addresses, and with few jobs on the reservation, people travel frequently for work. Navajos went to court after a switch to vote by mail, saying it made it harder to receive ballots through unreliable mail service and for elderly Navajo-language speakers to read them.\n\nElections officials have worked to address those obstacles, but Navajo leaders remain skeptical.\n\nThe road to Grayeyes\u2019 candidacy also went through federal court. The county disqualified him from the ballot after the clerk decided he lived outside the district. Grayeyes fought back, noting he has been registered to vote there for decades.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s degrading to be told, \u2018You don\u2019t live here,\u2019\u201d Grayeyes said. \u201cIt\u2019s a sacred thing.\u201d\n\nA federal judge sided with him, finding the county clerk wrongly backdated the complaint from a would-be rival for the seat.\n\nOutgoing San Juan County Commissioner Phil Lyman sees that ruling as part of the county\u2019s ongoing struggle against the federal government, which owns most of the land in the county. Lyman became a figure in the states\u2019 rights movement when he was convicted of a misdemeanor after leading a protest ATV ride through a closed canyon.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s intended to break the county,\u201d said Lyman, who\u2019s running for a state legislative seat. \u201cThis paternalistic management of Native Americans, it\u2019s a concept whose time has way past. But to turn it and say San Juan County is the author of that is the hugest disservice.\u201d\n\nInstead, he and Adams say federal and tribal leaders have let Utah Navajos down.\n\nBut Kenneth Maryboy, a Navajo running unopposed for another commission seat, said the county could and should do more.\n\n\u201cIf we have two Native Americans in there .... that would be leverage to make things happen,\u201d he said.\n\nNavajo voter Julie Ann Holiday is glad to see more Native Americans on the ballot. She and her husband live in a traditional Navajo hogan, a circular, one-room dwelling with a wood stove and dirt floor. It has no water tap and is serviced by a plywood outhouse. It was originally built to host ceremonies for her father, who died after years of working in nearby uranium mines.\n\nGrowing up, Holiday often rode 70 miles (113 kilometers) to school in Blanding. The schools are closer to reservation homes now, after Navajos filed a lawsuit against the county. Holiday earned her master\u2019s degree online from her hogan, after convincing tribal electricity officials to hook up a satellite dish outside.\n\nShe loves both cultures that intersect at her home but sometimes feels caught between two worlds.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re right on the edge of the Navajo Nation and San Juan County. You don\u2019t know which way to turn,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve come a long way to get what we need. We just worked hard for it.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Whitehurst on Twitter at @lwhitehurst.

Tina Smith and Republican Karin Housley. (Star Tribune via AP, File)\n\nIn the race to complete former Minnesota Sen. Al Franken\u2019s term, Republican hopeful Karin Housley has branded Democratic Sen. Tina Smith as an extreme liberal and a political insider. In a recent ad, she employed a new line: Smith has profited off the spread of opioid painkillers that have led to thousands of deaths.\n\nSmith, the state\u2019s former lieutenant governor, was appointed to the U.S. Senate seat in January after Franken resigned amid allegations of sexual misconduct. Housley, a second-term state senator and the wife of Hall of Fame hockey player Phil Housley, quickly launched her campaign after Franken\u2019s resignation.\n\nThe Housley campaign makes several claims about Smith\u2019s wealth in the attack ad, titled \u201cThe Good Life,\u201d that began airing statewide earlier this month and shows a couple on the beach clinking champagne glasses.\n\nA look at one of the ad\u2019s claims:\n\nAD: \u201cTina profited from the opioid crisis\u201d - television ad that began running Oct. 18.\n\nTHE FACTS: The Housley campaign\u2019s claim that Smith profited off the opioid crisis through investments is misleading.\n\nSmith\u2019s husband, Archie Smith, is a successful independent investor, focusing largely on health care and medical companies.\n\nHousley\u2019s ad claim is based on two of Archie Smith\u2019s investments \u2014 one in Abbott Laboratories, the other in Johnson & Johnson that are listed in the senator\u2019s financial disclosure forms . The forms reveal the Smiths are worth between $5 million and $12 million.\n\nSmith\u2019s husband has between $250,000 and $500,0000 invested in Abbott, which marketed OxyContin until 2002. The painkiller has been blamed for escalating the addiction crisis that has left more than 340,000 Americans dead since 2000.\n\nBut Archie Smith only acquired the stock last year, well after Abbott Labs quit marketing OxyContin and had divested it\u2019s involvement with the painkiller Vicodin in 2013. He received the stock when Abbott took over Minnesota-based St. Jude Medical Center last year, which he had initially invested in, Smith\u2019s campaign said.\n\n\u201cThey were a major opioid player in the past,\u201d Andrew Kolodny, the director of opioid policy research at Brandeis University in Massachusetts, said of Abbott. \u201cToday, they\u2019re not.\u201d\n\nDisclosure forms show that Archie Smith has also held a smaller investment worth between $1,001 and $15,000 in Johnson & Johnson, the world\u2019s biggest maker of health care products. He\u2019s invested in J&J since 1997, according to the campaign.\n\nIt\u2019s true the company has been involved with opioid production, including manufacturing an opioid pain patch called Duragesic. J&J has also been named in several lawsuits that blame pharmaceutical companies for triggering the nation\u2019s opioid epidemic.\n\nBut it\u2019s less clear how Archie Smith, who reported between $200 and $1,000 in dividends from his J&J stock last year in disclosure forms, might have profited off that activity.\n\nJohnson & Johnson is a massive company that recorded $76.5 billion in sales last year from its three divisions: biotech drugs, medical devices and consumer goods \u2014 such as baby shampoo or Band-Aids.\n\nPharmaceuticals account for roughly a third of the company\u2019s profits, said Damien Conover an analyst for Morningstar, a financial research and services company in Chicago.\n\nDuragesic led drug sales in the pharmaceutical division for Johnson & Johnson in the 1990s and early 2000s, while Archie Smith owned stock, but sales began to slip more than a decade ago as the market faced increased competition.\n\nConover said Johnson & Johnson\u2019s pharmaceutical division currently focuses more on oncology and immunology drugs.\n\n\u201cIt gets really diversified,\u201d Conover said of the J&J\u2019s pharmaceutical division. \u201cThey don\u2019t have much of a pain franchise.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFind AP Fact Checks at http://apne.ws/2kbx8bd\n\nFollow @APFactCheck on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APFactCheck\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "No. 3 Notre Dame (8-0, No. 4 CFP) at Northwestern (5-3), 7:15 p.m. EDT (ESPN).\n\nLine: Notre Dame by 9\u00bd.\n\nSeries record: Notre Dame leads 37-9-2.\n\nWHAT\u2019S AT STAKE?\n\nNotre Dame is trying to remain in line for a playoff spot with its best start since the 2012 team went unbeaten before getting routed by Alabama in the BCS championship game.

(AP) \u2014 The NFL trading deadline passed and the New York Giants decided to stand pat despite speculation they would be wheeling and dealing with a second straight season going down the tubes.\n\nLinebacker Olivier Vernon, cornerback Janoris Jenkins and safety Landon Collins will finish the season with the Giants, who are 1-7 for the second straight year and have virtually no chance of making the playoffs in Pat Shurmur\u2019s first season as coach.\n\nCornerback Eli Apple and 2016 All-Pro defensive tackle Damon Harrison were the only players traded, and they were shipped the week before the deadline.\n\nHeading into their bye week, the question facing Shurmur is where does the team go from here.\n\nTo be honest, there isn\u2019t a lot he can do. This team has only made the playoffs once since winning the Super Bowl in 2012. There is not a lot of depth.\n\nThe one change fans and the media want is at quarterback. Two-time Super Bowl MVP Eli Manning is as stationary as a quarterback can be and that does not work in the NFL, especially when his offense line is playing poorly. The 37-year-old has been sacked 31 times and this past Sunday he seemed to ducking as soon as the pressure got near him.\n\nMany wanted Shurmur to put in rookie Kyle Lauletta to see what the fourth-round pick out of Richmond could do.\n\nThat\u2019s probably not going to happen now.\n\nThe 22-year-old was arrested Tuesday on motor vehicle and related disorderly persons offenses while driving near a road construction site to practice.\n\nWeehawken police said he failed to obey a police officer\u2019s order and almost hit the officer while making an illegal turn. He was charged with eluding police, obstructing administration of law and resisting arrest. He was also charged with reckless driving, disregarding an officer\u2019s directions, improper turn and failure to remain in a marked lane.\n\nHe might face a league suspension. The Giants would look foolish replacing Manning for him. Veteran Alex Tanney also isn\u2019t the answer.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to do what we can to win this season, and certainly you always do what you can in the short run,\u201d Shurmur said before heading into the bye.\n\nWhat the Giants will do is evaluate all facets of their games to find plays that work.\n\nThere is little they can do with the offense line. It was revamped to start the season and 60 percent has changed. Center Jon Halapio broke a leg and is done for the season. Right tackle Ereck Flowers was cut and free agent right guard Patrick Omameh struggled, was hurt and lost his job. Left tackle Nate Solder, the big free agent signing who has struggled at times, and rookie second-round draft pick Will Hernandez are the only starters remaining.\n\nThe talent in the skill positions is obvious. Odell Beckham Jr. (61 catches for 785 yards) and Sterling Shepard (40 for 542) are outstanding receivers.\n\nShurmur needs to find a way to get second-year tight end Evan Engram more involved. He was an explosive receiver last season and that has been missing.\n\nSaquon Barkley, the No. 2 overall pick in the draft, has helped the passing game, catching 58 passes for 497 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nThe biggest need is to get the running game going. Despite getting 519 yards from Barkley, the rest of the team has contributed just over 100 yards. It has allowed opposing defenses to play the pass, limiting the offense. The unit has hurt itself with penalties and sacks that have created too many third-and-long plays, and it has settled for too many field goals, averaging 18.5 points.\n\n\u201cWe got good players,\u201d said Manning, who wants to remain the starting quarterback. \u201cThere\u2019s some good football. There are some good plays. There\u2019s some big plays, some explosive plays. There\u2019s just some bad football as well. So, it\u2019s just cleaning up the bad stuff.\u201d\n\nThe positive for the Giants has been James Bettcher\u2019s defense. It has given the Giants a chance to win games. Its only drawback is it has not taken the ball away more. New York has seven takeaways.\n\n\u201cWe always said from the beginning, we got all the weapons that we showcase, and we expected to win,\u201d Collins said of the season. \u201cSo yeah, I\u2019m very surprised by it.\u201d\n\nBarkley, who lost only five games in his last two seasons at Penn State, said losing in the NFL has been an adjustment for him, as it has been for many of his teammates.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s part of the NFL, it\u2019s a part of the sport. It\u2019s adversity right now,\u201d Barkley said. \u201cWhen we get this thing going, and we get this thing rolling, we\u2019re going to look back at this and laugh, and see how this made us tougher.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) \u2014 The Ohio High School Athletic Association has postponed Saturday\u2019s state cross country races because of flooding at the course outside Columbus.\n\nOHSAA officials on Thursday said championship races for boys and girls will be held Nov. 10 at National Trail Raceway in Hebron.\n\nExecutive Director Jerry Snodgrass said in a statement the postponement is the \u201cbest solution\u201d for the safety and well-being of runners and that it\u2019s hoped conditions will have improved by next weekend.\n\nThe Division III race for boys will begin at 11 a.m., followed by boys Division II at 11:45 a.m. and Division I boys at 12:30 p.m. The girls Division III race will begin at 1:30 p.m., Division II at 2:15 p.m. and Division I at 3 p.m.", "Passengers who get off an Aegean Airlines plane are welcomed with cookies, after landing at Skopje International Airport, Macedonia, Thursday, Nov. 1, 2018.

(AP Photo/Rick Bowmer)\n\nALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) \u2014 Native Americans are running for high-profile seats this year in New Mexico, Kansas, Minnesota and Idaho in what could bring historic gains for a population once excluded from electoral politics.\n\nIndian voters also could swing important races in Montana, Arizona and North Dakota.\n\nThe midterm election Tuesday comes 70 years after Isleta Pueblo member Miguel Trujillo\u2019s landmark court challenge against a New Mexico law that had prevented Native Americans from voting.\n\nAnd 50 years ago, Native American voters were credited with helping Robert F. Kennedy win a historic victory in South Dakota\u2019s Democratic presidential primary.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at how the Native American vote has become a key bloc in the U.S. after decades of exclusion:\n\n___\n\nTHE LONG FIGHT\n\nWritten into the original U.S. Constitution was a clause that said Indians who didn\u2019t pay taxes could not be counted in the voting population of states. That prevented Native Americans living in tribal communities \u2014 considered sovereign nations \u2014 from becoming U.S. citizens and voting members of the new democracy.\n\nLike African Americans, Native Americans were excluded from voting and public accommodations long after the Civil War and the Wounded Knee Massacre of 1890 in South Dakota.\n\nThe Indian Naturalization Act of 1890 finally granted citizenship to Native Americans by an application process, but many weren\u2019t allowed to vote until President Calvin Coolidge signed the Indian Citizenship Act in 1924.\n\nStill, a number of states such as New Mexico and Arizona barred many Native Americans from voting.\n\nThat changed after World War II veteran Marine Sgt. Miguel Trujillo Sr. sued New Mexico when a county clerk refused to allow him to register to vote because he lived on tribal land.\n\nTrujillo won his case, clearing the way for Native Americans in New Mexico and elsewhere to vote.\n\n___\n\nREMAINING BARRIERS\n\nIn 1975 under President Gerald Ford, the Voting Rights Act was amended with changes that mentioned Alaska, Arizona and parts of South Dakota as places that discriminated against Native Americans through ballot language. The federal law required that polling locations offer information in Spanish and various Native languages.\n\nAs late as the 1990s, some New Mexico counties were subject to U.S. Justice Department consent decrees for violating the Voting Rights Act by not providing information in Native languages.\n\nMeanwhile, voters began electing Native Americans to seats in state Legislatures. In 1992, Democrat Ben Nighthorse Campbell of Colorado became the first Native American elected to the U.S. Senate. He later switched to the Republican Party.\n\n___\n\nTHE 2018 ELECTION\n\nA new Republican-backed ID law in North Dakota upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court prevents Native Americans without a residential address from voting.\n\nOpponents say the law is intended to disenfranchise Native American voters who historically have used post office boxes as addresses.\n\nSupporters of the law say it\u2019s meant to combat voter fraud.\n\nSen. Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat, won a close race in 2012 in the state with the help of Native American voters. She is now facing a strong challenge from Republican Rep. Kevin Cramer.\n\nElsewhere, Democrats Debra Haaland in New Mexico and Sharice Davids in Kansas are vying to become the first Native American women elected to the U.S. House.\n\nIn Idaho, Paulette Jordan , a Democrat, is vying to become the nation\u2019s first elected Native American governor.\n\nVoters in Minnesota will elect the state\u2019s first Native American lieutenant governor. Both candidates \u2014 Democrat state Rep. Peggy Flanagan and Republican Donna Bergstrom \u2014 are members of tribal nations that are bands of Ojibwe.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press Writer Russell Contreras is a member of the AP\u2019s race and ethnicity team.

Races for governor, legislative seats and other state-level offices have attracted more than $2 billion in campaign contributions this year. That nearly matches contributions to congressional elections, the highest profile political events this year. The top states this year for reported contributions to candidates are, in order, Illinois, California, Texas, Florida, New York, Georgia and Pennsylvania. Polls have consistently shown a tight race in Florida between DeSantis, a loyalist to President Donald Trump, and Tallahassee Mayor Gillum. (AP Photo/Chris O'Meara, Files)\n\nThe story of money in politics doesn\u2019t stop with spending on races for Congress.\n\nCandidates for governor, legislature and other state offices this year have brought in $2.2 billion in campaign contributions \u2014 nearly matching the combined total of $2.4 billion for candidates for the U.S. House and Senate.\n\nThat makes this year among the most expensive ever in state-level politics, and the total will only grow in the final stretch before Tuesday\u2019s election.\n\nAt stake is control of 36 governors\u2019 offices and legislative chambers in most states.\n\nActivists see state elections as a good investment because it doesn\u2019t take as much money to influence them as it does congressional races.\n\nThe upstart organization Flippable has raised about $1 million this year for 130 Democratic state legislative candidates in 10 states. Its chief executive, Catherine Vaughan, points out that legislative campaigns cost around $150,000 on average, compared with more than $1 million for a congressional race.\n\nAn Associated Press analysis of campaign finance data collected by the National Institute on Money in Politics, the Federal Election Commission and the IRS shows where the state-level money is going.\n\n___\n\nTHE BIG PICTURE\n\nThe top states this year for reported contributions to candidates are, in order, Illinois, California, Texas, Florida, New York, Georgia and Pennsylvania. They also happen to be among the states with the largest populations \u2014 but not necessarily the most competitive state-level races.\n\nDonors also have contributed more than $400 million to support or oppose ballot initiatives.\n\nWhile Democrats are spending more in federal elections, it\u2019s about even in state-level elections. As of Thursday, reports processed by the National Institute on Money in Politics show that both parties had brought in just over $1 billion, with a slight edge for the GOP. Nonpartisan and third-party candidates had raised about $40 million.\n\nBut the money race is not even on a state-by-state basis. Republicans running for legislatures have raised $370 million to Democrats\u2019 $354 million. It\u2019s no surprise that Wyoming Republicans have raised six times as much as Democrats and that Massachusetts Democrats have nearly as big an advantage.\n\nBut there\u2019s also lopsided funding in some more competitive states. Republican legislative candidates have brought in about twice as much as Democrats in Florida. In Colorado, Democrats have a 2-to-1 fundraising advantage.\n\n___\n\nTHE MOST EXPENSIVE RACES\n\nIllinois has the second most expensive race for governor on record at $210 million so far. This year\u2019s second costliest governor\u2019s race is in Florida.\n\nBoth already are among the 10 costliest races for governor on record.\n\nPolls have consistently shown a tight race in Florida between U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis, a loyalist to President Donald Trump, and Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum.\n\nIn Illinois, nearly 90 percent of contributions have come from just three wealthy investors. Democratic challenger J.B. Pritzker, who is leading in polls, has used more than $106 million of his own money in the race.\n\nRepublican incumbent Bruce Rauner has spent $57 million. Citadel founder Ken Griffin has kicked in more than $22 million to support Rauner.\n\nThe most expensive state legislative race is for a state Senate seat in north Texas that has cost $10.8 million so far. Nearly half the total was from Phillip Huffines, who self-financed his losing Republican primary campaign.\n\nThe most expensive legislative race with a competitive general election is the 12th Senate District in central California. Democrat Anna Caballero and Republican Rob Poythress each have raised about $2 million.\n\n___\n\nBIGGEST SPENDERS\n\nThe list of the largest contributors across all state-level elections is dominated by self-funded candidates. Nine candidates, all running for governor, have spent at least $10 million on themselves this year. In addition to the two in Illinois, only one other \u2014 Jared Polis, a Colorado Democrat \u2014 won a primary.\n\nThe list of big organizational contributors is dominated by labor groups spreading money to a variety of candidates \u2014 mostly but not exclusively Democrats. Unions representing laborers, educators, service workers and plumbers, including their regional affiliates, have contributed at least $7 million each.\n\nRealtor associations also have contributed more than $11 million, the majority of it to Republicans.\n\n___\n\nINDEPENDENT MONEY\n\nMost states limit the amount a contributor can give to each candidate. But political groups, companies, charities and individuals have no restrictions on how much they can spend on their own.\n\nIn some cases, they can do this spending without disclosing the identities of their donors; in some states, they don\u2019t even have to report the spending.\n\nThe one catch: They\u2019re generally not allowed to coordinate with the candidates\u2019 official campaigns.\n\nAmong those that do report spending are national party-affiliated organizations, which have arms that do work with campaigns. Republican groups trying to elect their partisans to governor\u2019s offices, legislatures and other positions such as state attorney general have an edge over Democrats. Corporations are major contributors to the groups on both sides.\n\nFilings by the Republican Governors Association this month show it has raised $156 million from the start of 2017 through September. The Democratic Governors Association brought in $108 million through Oct. 17. Both use much of their money to fund ads attacking their opponents.\n\nGroups that are key to the parties\u2019 attempts to win state legislative seats also are spending big this cycle.\n\nThe Republican State Leadership Committee had raised $33 million through September and expects to spend up to $50 million.\n\nIts counterpart, the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, said it has brought in $35 million through October, a record amount for the group. Its efforts are being bolstered this year by other organizations with similar goals.\n\n___\n\nTHE NATIONAL PLAYERS\n\nA handful of wealthy individuals fund organizations that spend on politics across the country.\n\nThe industrialist brothers Charles and David Koch and other conservatives are major players through a group of organizations that include Americans for Prosperity. It\u2019s impossible to tell from campaign finance filings how much they\u2019re spending this year. An Americans for Prosperity spokeswoman said the network plans to put a total of $400 million into state and federal political efforts in 2017 and 2018 but declined to break down how much would go to state races.\n\nTom Steyer, a San Francisco liberal who has called for impeaching Trump, has announced contributions totaling at least $7 million to support Florida\u2019s Gillum.\n\nThat includes more than $2 million in direct contributions to a political action committee that supports Gillum, along with $800,000 from the Steyer group NextGen Climate America and direct mail pieces being sent by another Steyer group, Need to Impeach.\n\n___\n\nFollow Mulvihill at http://www.twitter.com/geoffmulvihill", "WICHITA, Kan.

(AP) \u2014 As states shy away from coal-fired power, a northern Arizona tribe is exploring the purchase of a coal plant on its land.\n\nThe Navajo Generating Station near the Arizona-Utah border and its feed mine are slated to close at the end of 2019, the victims of cheaper power from natural gas.\n\nA potential new owner and operator ended negotiations to take over the plant in September after they couldn\u2019t find anyone to buy the power. The Navajo Transitional Energy Company said it\u2019s now considering ownership of the plant at the invitation of the tribe.\n\nClark Moseley, the company\u2019s chief executive, said he expects to have a plan for the 2,250-megawatt plant in place by the end of the year.\n\n\u201cWe are currently working to evaluate all possible solutions to ensure the continued operation of Navajo Generating Station and Kayenta Mine past 2019,\u201d he said in a statement Thursday.\n\nHundreds of Navajos work in the coal industry, and the revenues make up a hefty chunk of the tribe\u2019s general budget, not including federal money. The tribe created the Navajo Transitional Energy Company to buy a coal mine in northwestern New Mexico five years ago. The company also owns a 7 percent stake in two units at the Four Corners Power Plant fed by the mine.\n\nThe move to buy the Navajo Generating Station near Page is considered risky. The current operator, the Salt River Project, has said the plant no longer is economical. The Congressional Research Service recently found that one of the major users of the power, the Central Arizona Project, is not legally obligated to purchase electricity from the plant under new ownership.\n\nCoal also has fallen out of favor in nearby states. Navajo government officials are fighting a ballot measure in Arizona that would require utilities regulated by the state to get 50 percent of their power from renewables by 2030. The current standard is 15 percent by 2025.\n\nNavajo Transitional Energy approached the Salt River Project in mid-October to review data on the power plant, said SRP spokesman Scott Harelson. The plant likely would shut down temporarily even as the Navajo Nation vets it. At least 150 employees already have been moved to other facilities in anticipation of the shutdown, and SRP won\u2019t stray from decommissioning plans, Harelson said.\n\nNavajo President Russell Begaye and Tribal Council Speaker LoRenzo Bates remained optimistic about a future for the coal plant even after New York-based Avenue Capital and Chicago-based Middle River Power terminated negotiations, saying the tribe had various though unspecified options.\n\n\u201cTime is not on our side, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean we\u2019re going to throw in the towel because we\u2019re not,\u201d Bates told The Associated Press at the time. \u201cIt\u2019s not over until it\u2019s over. And it\u2019s over when leadership speaks, no one else.\u201d\n\nThe tribe\u2019s move toward ownership comes ahead of an election that will result in a new president and speaker. Begaye didn\u2019t advance beyond the presidential primary, and Bates didn\u2019t seek re-election.\n\nOne of the presidential candidates, Joe Shirley Jr., said he would do what he can to save the jobs and revenue but acknowledged major hurdles exist.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we have the wherewithal to purchase anything of that magnitude,\u201d he said. \u201cThe next administration needs to take a real good look-see on the feasibility of spending billions of dollars on a thing that possibly could go away.\u201d\n\nShirley\u2019s challenger, Jonathan Nez, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nPercy Deal who lives near the coal mine at Big Mountain said Navajo leaders are disillusioned in thinking that coal should be a part of the tribe\u2019s future or that President Donald Trump\u2019s administration can save the industry. He envisions the time when coal no longer is extracted from what he called the soul of Mother Earth.\n\n\u201cEverything that\u2019s essential to our way of life is going to begin to heal and recover,\u201d he said. \u201cI see that day coming, and I\u2019m really looking forward to it.\u201d", "Remains identified of Texas soldier who went missing in 1950\n\nMcKINNEY, Texas (AP) \u2014 U.S. military officials have identified the remains of a 20-year-old Texas soldier who went missing in 1950 following a combat operation in South Korea.\n\nArmy Pfc.

The IOC has hinted it could refuse to recognize AIBA if the other candidate, incumbent interim president Gafur Rakhimov, wins, as he is on a U.S. Treasury Department sanctions list for alleged ties to organized crime and international heroin trafficking, although he denies wrongdoing. (AP Photo/Pavel Golovkin)\n\nMOSCOW (AP) \u2014 With boxing\u2019s Olympic future on the line, Serik Konakbayev will fight to save his sport.\n\nThe one-time Olympic silver medalist from Kazakhstan is the underdog candidate in Saturday\u2019s presidential vote at AIBA, the amateur boxing federation locked in conflict with the International Olympic Committee, which hasn\u2019t decided whether boxing will be on the 2020 Olympic program.\n\nThe IOC hinted it could refuse to recognize AIBA if incumbent interim president Gafur Rakhimov, the other candidate, wins. Rakhimov is on a U.S. Treasury Department sanctions list for alleged ties to organized crime and international heroin trafficking but has denied wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cIf he wins, the IOC will take a tough decision which won\u2019t make us happy,\u201d Konakbayev told the Associated Press, referring to Rakhimov. \u201cWe could lose participation as an Olympic sport in the Olympic Games in Tokyo. That\u2019s the scariest thing and we should all think about that.\u201d\n\nKonakbayev, 59, held back from personal criticism of Rakhimov, saying he was merely relaying the IOC\u2019s concerns.\n\n\u201cMr. Rakhimov has been in AIBA for a long time, he loves boxing and Mr. Rakhimov wants to make boxing better,\u201d he said, but added: \u201cI think that the doubts which the IOC has expressed are not groundless, so as an organization, we need to take it all seriously and be ready to avoid these consequences.\u201d\n\nThe IOC has suggested it could keep boxing on the 2020 program but remove a role for AIBA, though it\u2019s not clear how that might work. AIBA\u2019s financial woes could deepen if it loses its cut of Olympic TV money. The IOC did not let Rakhimov, who is based in Dubai, attend the Youth Olympics in Buenos Aires last month.\n\nKonakbayev, a former politician in his native Kazakhstan and amateur boxing\u2019s top official in Asia, said the sport is \u201csliding backwards\u201d and losing viewers to mixed martial arts.\n\nSince Konakbayev fought in the 1980 Olympics, in which he finished second in the light welterweight division, \u201cwe\u2019ve lost the spice and popularity of boxing,\u201d he said. Mixed martial arts promotions are luring viewers and talented young fighters with their superior showmanship, he argued, while boxing struggles with financial problems, infighting and \u201cwrong decisions by judges.\u201d\n\nOlympic boxing has long been dogged by controversial judging, and at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, AIBA sent home referees and judges who it said had fallen short.\n\nThe crowd in Rio booed Russia\u2019s Evgeny Tishchenko after he won a gold medal by a unanimous decision over Kazakhstan\u2019s Vasily Levit despite Levit appearing the more aggressive fighter. Irish bantamweight Michael Conlan also profanely objected to a quarterfinal loss to Russia\u2019s Vladimir Nikitin and accused AIBA and Russia of corruption.\n\nKonakbayev said he was there with IOC president Thomas Bach and \u201csaw his concern and disappointment. I don\u2019t think that makes our sport look good.\u201d\n\nAIBA\u2019s signature reform for 2016 \u2014 letting pro fighters into the Olympic ring with amateurs \u2014 was a failed experiment, Konakbayev said.\n\n\u201cAs an Olympian myself, who represented the Soviet Union on the world stage, I think it may be too early. Amateur and professional boxing are two different cultures,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can host some exhibition fights, but the Olympics in Rio showed that professional boxing isn\u2019t ready to be part of the Olympics.\u201d\n\nNone of the three pros who fought in Rio were big names, and none won a medal.\n\nKonakbayev is cautious about his chances of winning Saturday\u2019s vote against Rakhimov, who has a higher profile as interim president. Indeed, Konakbayev only made the ballot after the Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled that his nominations were in fact valid despite an earlier attempt by AIBA to exclude him.\n\nPreparing for a last round of lobbying, Konakbayev is drawing on his boxing career for motivation.\n\n\u201cEach candidate, when he goes to the vote, is always focused on victory,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a former boxer, I\u2019m focused only on winning.\u201d\n\n___\n\nJames Ellingworth is at https://twitter.com/jellingworth\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "FARGO, N.D.

(AP Photo/Michael Perez)\n\nPHILADELPHIA (AP) \u2014 Repeating as Super Bowl champions already was a tough task before the Philadelphia Eagles had a mediocre first half.\n\nThe offense was inconsistent, the defense couldn\u2019t protect leads in the fourth quarter and injuries were a factor. So the Eagles entered their bye at 4-4 and were second behind Washington (5-2) in the NFC East.\n\nThey have a challenging schedule coming up and it\u2019s unlikely they\u2019ll win enough games to get a first-round bye if they can even catch the Redskins.\n\nBut help is on the way from the outside and from within.\n\nWide receiver Golden Tate was acquired from Detroit shortly before the NFL\u2019s trade deadline, giving Carson Wentz a needed option. The Eagles are averaging only 22.2 points per game, down from 28.6 last year.\n\nRunning back Darren Sproles could be returning for Philadelphia\u2019s next game against Dallas after being sidelined since injuring his hamstring in Week 1.

I plan on going to the playoffs and playing a few more.\u201d\n\nGiving up a third-round pick for Tate, who is in the final season of his contract, was a risky move.

He has been mostly excellent since missing the first two games while recovering from knee surgery that forced him to miss the playoffs.

(AP Photo/Ben Margot, File)\n\nINDIANAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 Andrew Luck\u2019s health was Indianapolis\u2019 biggest question the past two years.\n\nHalfway through his comeback season, the star quarterback looks like his old self and the numbers suggest he\u2019s actually playing better.\n\nLuck\u2019s strong return has helped the Colts win back-to-back games for the first time in nearly two years and they head into the bye weekend full of momentum and plenty of hope.\n\n\u201cHe made some incredible plays. I mean some incredible plays, conversions on third downs, plays that he shouldn\u2019t make, plays that normal quarterbacks don\u2019t make,\u201d first-year coach Frank Reich said, describing Luck\u2019s impressive game Sunday at Oakland.\n\nMany wondered if Luck could ever regain the form that had many calling him the league\u2019s best young quarterback before Indy took him with the No. 1 overall draft pick in 2012.\n\nHe exceeded the hype by leading the Colts to playoff appearances in each of his first three seasons and earning Pro Bowl selections all three years, too.\n\nThen came the injuries and the losses. Luck hurt his right shoulder early in the 2015 season and wound up missing nine games \u2014 the last seven with a lacerated kidney. He sat out one game in 2016 with a concussion and missed the entire 2017 season after having surgery for a partially torn labrum in his throwing shoulder.\n\nBut he\u2019s answered the critics with a solid first half.\n\nIndy (3-5) needs one more win to match last season\u2019s victory total and faces the second-easiest schedule over the second half. They\u2019re two games out of the AFC South lead with five division games remaining and Luck getting even stronger.\n\nHe is 225 of 342 with 2,187 yards, 23 touchdowns \u2014 a pace to set career highs in each category including completion rate (65.8 percent). He\u2019s also flirting with the best rating of his career at 96.2. He had a 96.4 in 2016.\n\nNumbers only tell part of the tale, though.\n\nLuck has done it despite losing top receiver T.Y. Hilton for two games with a hamstring injury, Pro Bowl tight end Jack Doyle for five games with an injured hip and five different starting lineups on the offensive line.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re returning from an injury, you\u2019re learning a new system, you\u2019ve got T.Y. Hilton and some receivers hurt and you\u2019re breaking in some new linemen \u2014 it\u2019s not going to be as easy as people think,\u201d Raiders coach Jon Gruden said before last weekend\u2019s game. \u201cI\u2019ve got a lot of respect for what he has done in this league and what his capabilities are.\u201d\n\nAn improving cast could make Luck & Co. even tougher to contend with.\n\nFrom 2012-17, Colts running backs topped the 100-yard mark just four times. Last week, Marlon Mack became Indy\u2019s first back with consecutive 100-yard games since Joseph Addai in 2007.\n\nThe revamped offensive line has allowed just 10 sacks, a stark contrast to the 156 times Luck went down in his first 70 starts. In fact, Luck hasn\u2019t been sacked in three games \u2014 the longest stretch since he left Stanford.\n\nPart of the explanation is Reich\u2019s philosophical change, asking Luck to make quicker decisions.\n\nThat, too, has showed in the numbers.\n\nHis completion rate and rating against defenders within 1 yard of a receiver have jumped from 25.9 percent and a 45.0 rating in 2016 to 36.0 and 72.5 this season.\n\nAnd while his throws over 20 yards have declined from 2016 to 2018, his rating on throws between 11 and 20 yards has gone from 99.0 to 106.0.\n\nThe one bugaboo continues to be interceptions. Luck has thrown eight this season, putting him on a pace to throw more than he has in all but two seasons. But he\u2019s thrown five in the past six games and none in four of those six.\n\n\u201cNo one on this team is going to go out with a sort of harness on them and say you can\u2019t go play full speed,\u201d Luck said recently. \u201cI think our coaches do a great job of allowing us to play free and fast and loose, but within that, I guess at the same time you have to play disciplined.\u201d\n\nWhere would the Colts be if Luck had stayed healthy?\n\nNobody truly knows.\n\nYes, he would have reached 20,000 yards passing sooner. The Colts may not have missed the playoffs each of the past three seasons. His progression may have been a little steadier, and all those pesky questions about his arm may never have been an issue.\n\nBut, for now, the Colts are just happy to have Luck back, playing well.\n\n\u201cWhen you have the quarterback that we have there is an expectation that we have to score points,\u201d Reich said. \u201cEverybody in this building knows we have an elite quarterback.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP Pro Football Writer Josh Dubow also contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "LINCOLN, Neb.

The unnamed employee accused of the harassment was also fired.\n\n\u201cI was angry and disappointed with the behavior of Director Diamond,\u201d Ricketts said. \u201cWe have high standards with regard to how we expect people to behave, especially when they\u2019re in a leadership role.\u201d\n\nRicketts said several female workers complained that the temporary employee was dismissive, combative, interrupted them when they tried to talk and sexually harassed them.

Bob Krist, the Democratic candidate for governor, noted that other appointees of the Republican Ricketts have been fired or resigned for bad decisions and behavior.\n\nFormer Nebraska Supreme Court Justice Max Kelch stepped down in January amid sexual harassment allegations, less than two years after Ricketts appointed him.\n\nIn July 2017, Ricketts fired Nebraska State Patrol Superintendent Brad Rice after an investigation found that high-ranking patrol officials tried to influence the outcome of at least four internal reviews, failed to disclose a dozen cases of trooper misconduct and didn\u2019t properly investigate sexual misconduct accusations.\n\n\u201cWomen should be treated with respect and dignity in the workplace,\u201d said Krist, of Omaha. \u201cThey should not, under any circumstance, be expected to endure harassment or discrimination, and no person should work in state government who either condones, ignores or would allow this kind of behavior.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Grant Schulte on Twitter at https://twitter.com/GrantSchulte", "Maine would be first to offer universal home care\n\nAUGUSTA, Maine (AP) \u2014 More than 2 million dollars has poured into the campaign over a first-in-the-nation ballot proposal to provide universal home care in Maine.\n\nLeaders of the campaign, funded by liberal out-of-state groups, want Maine to pioneer a new model other states could mimic by providing care, regardless of income.\n\nSupporters say the need to help the elderly and individuals with disabilities stay in their homes amid rising health care costs and shortages of direct care workers is particularly pressing in Maine, which is largely rural and has the highest median age of any state, according to census data.\n\n\u201cMy wife couldn\u2019t handle me if I had to be bathed and turned over and helped up and helped down,\u201d said Jerry Genesio, 80, a Marine veteran living in a Scarborough retirement community who has had difficulty walking since being forced to jump from a helicopter in the Philippines and fracturing bones.

Employers and employees would each pay 1.9 percent on income from wages.\n\nThat would rake in $310 million annually from about 60,000 households.\n\nBusiness groups point out that as written, the tax penalizes married couples who make above $128,4000 together.\n\nMike Tipping, spokesman for Maine People\u2019s Alliance, which launched the referendum, says lawmakers can fix that unintended issue.\n\nCritics say the referendum lacks income or residency tests. Tipping said providing home care regardless of income will keep individuals from having to spend down their assets or sell their home.\n\n___\n\nNEW BOARD\n\nA nine-person board would oversee providing in-home and community support services for all citizens with disabilities and the elderly.\n\nAn estimated 27,000 Mainers needing help with daily living could receive assistance, including stipends for family caregivers and funding for professional nursing, home health aides, home repair, rent subsidies and transportation.

Washington has also been considering a law to increase payroll contributions to provide family caregivers with $100 a day for a year.\n\nThe future of Maine\u2019s referendum is unclear, with scant polling.

It says many trips executives made on their helicopter were too short for such aircraft, like traveling between Knoxville and Chattanooga.

(AP) \u2014 Colorado went into its game against Arizona last season game planning to stop quarterback Brandon Dawkins.\n\nWhen Dawkins went down after a late hit out of bounds, Khalil Tate ran all over the Buffaloes for 327 yards, an FBS record by a quarterback.\n\nTate has been hampered by an ankle injury this season and hasn\u2019t put up the same prodigious numbers he did last season, but Colorado knows all too well what he\u2019s capable of once he gets rolling.\n\nThe Buffaloes (5-3, 2-3 Pac-12) get a second shot at Tate and the Wildcats (4-5, 3-3) on Friday night in Tucson.\n\n\u201cWe all vividly remember him running wild against us, there\u2019s no doubt about it,\u201d Buffaloes coach Mike MacIntyre said. \u201cWhen I turned on the tape and saw No. 14, I definitely had nightmares. He\u2019s a great athlete.\u201d\n\nTate injured his left ankle in the second game of this season, limiting his mobility before he sat out against UCLA two weeks ago.\n\nThe time off seemed to help.\n\nTate moved well last week against No. 19 Oregon, using his legs to extend plays and orchestrate Arizona\u2019s offense. The junior threw for 189 yards and three touchdowns on 19-of-33 passing in the 44-15 rout of the Ducks.\n\n\u201cWe had some underneath things that he can do a better job of. He understands that, we understand that,\u201d Arizona coach Kevin Sumlin said. \u201cHis percentage was up this week, really, because of the screen game and some things that were designed to get him into rhythm.\u201d\n\nA few more things to look for when Arizona hosts Colorado on Friday night:\n\nREELING BUFFALOES: Colorado was one of the Pac-12\u2032s biggest surprises early in the season after opening with five straight wins. The Buffaloes have gone into a tailspin since then, losing three straight. The Buffaloes lost 41-31 to Oregon State last week after blowing a 28-point lead, prompting a players-only meeting. \u201cThere were a lot of great things said in that meeting,\u201d CU quarterback Steven Montez said. \u201cThere were a lot of good things said from older guys all the way to younger guys. Younger guys stepped up and said what they thought was going on, how we can fix it and how we can get back on track.\u201d\n\nTAMING TAYLOR: Colorado might not want to put all its focus on stopping Tate the way J.J. Taylor has been running the ball. Taylor ran for 212 yards and two touchdowns against Oregon last week, joining Ka\u2019Deem Carey and Tate as the only Arizona players to ever have two games with at least 210 yards rushing. Taylor is fourth nationally with 1,029 yards and has scored six touchdowns.\n\nSHENAULT\u2019S STATUS: Colorado receiver Laviska Shenault Jr. has missed the past two games with a toe injury and is questionable for Friday\u2019s game. The Buffaloes could certainly use him. Despite missing time, Shenault still leads the Pac-12 with 60 catches for 780 yards and has scored six TDs. The sophomore also leads the nation with 130 yards per game, eight more than the next closest player.\n\nTHIRD DOWN DOMINANCE: A big key in Arizona\u2019s win over Oregon last week was its ability to shut down the Ducks on third down. The Wildcats created numerous third-and-long situations for the Ducks, limiting their options. Arizona made the most of the longshot situations, holding Oregon to 3 for 16 on third downs. \u201cOur defense got off the field on third down,\u201d Sumlin said. \u201cI thought our tackling was the best it\u2019s been during the year, really didn\u2019t give up a bunch of big plays.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "", "", "FILE - In this Oct. 8, 2018, file photo, Cleveland Cavaliers guard J.R.

(Gianluigi Guercia/Pool Photo via AP)\n\nJOHANNESBURG (AP) \u2014 South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said his country has survived a \u201cdark period\u201d when corruption was rampant and is now focused on achieving economic growth and land reform to win popular support in general elections next year.\n\n\u201cWe are moving from a very dark period of our recent history,\u201d said Ramaphosa to international journalists, describing that his ruling party, the African National Congress, is working to root out graft. \u201cWe are in a new period now, we are no longer in a period of just sliding downward ... now we are beginning to deal with corruption.\u201d\n\nRamaphosa said for the first time that he intends to testify before the Zondo Commission which is investigating the extent of corruption under former President Jacob Zuma, who resigned in February amid mounting scandals and faces criminal charges.\n\nRamaphosa said corruption in South Africa had become like an \u201camoeba with tentacles all over. To deal with it you must go to the heart of it and thereafter it then loosens its hold on everything else.\u201d He said South Africa\u2019s criminal justice system \u201cwill kick into action\u201d and the time will come when \u201cpeople are arrested, charged, found guilty and go to jail.\u201d\n\nRamaphosa, 65, rose to prominence in the 1980s as a trade union organizer in the struggle against apartheid, South Africa\u2019s former system of racial discrimination. When he became president in February, many South Africans hailed him as a leader who could steer South Africa back to the optimistic days when Nelson Mandela led South Africa from apartheid to democracy.\n\nHowever, nearly nine months into his presidency Ramaphosa has not found a quick fix to the country\u2019s problems, including unemployment at 27 percent and inequality ranked among the highest in the world. South Africa\u2019s economy, one of Africa\u2019s largest, is in recession. More than 24 years after the end of racial discrimination, many South African blacks complain they remain poor and disadvantaged.\n\nA pressing issue is land, with whites owning large swathes of farmland that were taken from black families during apartheid. The ANC and Ramaphosa have vowed to redistribute land without compensation, which has pleased some of their supporters but has alarmed many businessmen and potential international investors.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump waded into the land controversy in August when he tweeted that South Africa is seizing farms and that high numbers of farmers are being killed. In fact, the South African government has not authorized land seizures and says it is still deliberating on the best way to implement land reform.\n\nRamaphosa said Thursday that South Africa\u2019s land reform will not be as chaotic and economically disastrous as that in neighboring Zimbabwe.\n\n\u201cWe will not have any land grabs ... It will be a South African solution where we will be sure to act within our constitution and the rule of law ... It should never be anything that will degrade our economy or lead to national divisions. The way we deal with the land question should enhance the growth in our country.\u201d\n\nAfter Trump\u2019s controversial tweet, Ramaphosa said he sat next to the American president at a lunch at the United Nations and said they exchanged pleasantries.\n\n\u201cTo the extent that we spoke about land, he spoke about golf courses,\u201d said Ramaphosa. \u201cThat is land, I guess.\u201d", "KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) \u2014 Mitchell Schwartz was chosen by Cleveland in the second round of the 2012 draft with the idea he could be the next Joe Thomas, or at the very least learn from the Browns\u2019 star offensive tackle.\n\nWell, he did learn a lot of lessons. The biggest may have been durability.\n\nThomas once played 10,363 consecutive snaps over the span of 11 seasons before hurting his left arm in a game against Tennessee. The streak that began with Week 1 of his rookie year and survived a slew of injuries, including torn and strained knee ligaments and multiple high ankle sprains.\n\nSchwartz, who returns to Cleveland for the first time on the opposing sideline Sunday, has his own incredible streak going now that he\u2019s with the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nAfter playing every snap his first four seasons with the Browns, and continuing it during the past two-plus seasons in Kansas City, the snap count is up to 6,870 over the course of 104 games.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s done a heck of a job being able to endure,\u201d Chiefs coach Andy Reid said. \u201cHe had a good teacher he learned from, too, in Thomas. He had a nice streak going before he got hurt. Mitch has been tremendous. He\u2019s one of the smartest linemen I\u2019ve ever been around.\u201d\n\nSchwartz filled a massive need when the Chiefs signed him to a $33 million, five-year deal, and he has met all expectations. Not only did he help protect Alex Smith during some of his best years, and is now keeping young quarterback Patrick Mahomes clean during his breakout season, Schwartz also paved the way for Kareem Hunt to win last year\u2019s NFL rushing title as a rookie.\n\nSo far, the Chiefs have allowed just 10 sacks \u2014 one behind the New Orleans Saints for the fewest in the league \u2014 while leading the NFL in scoring and a number of other offensive categories. Delving deeper into the numbers, the Chiefs have a league-high 13 carries of at least 10 yards while running behind Schwartz on the right side of the offensive line.\n\nIn other words, the soft-spoken Schwartz is a big reason why Mahomes leads the NFL in yards passing and Hunt is fourth in the league in yards rushing.\n\n\u201cThose two tackles are really good players, Schwartz and (left tackle Eric) Fisher. They\u2019re the best we\u2019ve played since I\u2019ve been here,\u201d Broncos coach Vance Joseph said. \u201cThey\u2019ve blocked us one-on-one from time to time and they win a lot against us.\u201d\n\nThat may be the most incredible part of Schwartz\u2019s success rate: It has come against some of the best pass rushers in the NFL, including Broncos linebackers Von Miller and Bradley Chubb.\n\nElsewhere in the AFC West, he has to deal with the Chargers\u2019 Melvin Ingram and Joey Bosa, and until this past offseason, Raiders star Khalil Mack and his teammate Bruce Irvin.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been very blessed and fortunate to play and coach with a number of offensive linemen, and those guys never get the credit that they deserve,\u201d Chiefs offensive coordinator Eric Bieniemy said. \u201cThey get all the negative flack when they give up a sack or something, but those guys are the ultimate team players because they are going to do whatever it takes to win.\u201d\n\nEven if it means playing through bumps and bruises to keep a consecutive snaps streak going.\n\nSchwartz acknowledged this week that it will be odd returning to Cleveland, where he learned from one of the best offensive tackles to ever play the game. He has good memories from playing with the Browns, even if they never won enough, and he\u2019s looking forward to seeing some old friends.\n\nOnce the game begins, though, Schwartz is only worried about helping Kansas City keep winning.\n\n\u201cWe just keep trusting. No one gets upset, starts screaming or any of that stuff,\u201d Schwartz said. \u201cWe\u2019re a pretty good offense and if we go out there and do our jobs, it\u2019s pretty hard to stop us.\u201d\n\nNotes: Strong safety Eric Berry (heel), C Mitch Morse (concussion) and LB Frank Zombo (hamstring) did not practice Thursday.

(AP) \u2014 A federal judge on Thursday rejected an Arkansas Supreme Court justice\u2019s effort to halt attack ads and mailers from a Washington-based conservative group that is trying to unseat her in next week\u2019s election.\n\nU.S. District Judge Brian Miller denied Justice Courtney Goodson\u2019s request for a preliminary injunction halting the attacks from the Republican State Leadership Committee\u2019s Judicial Fairness Initiative. Goodson is running against David Sterling, an attorney for the state Department of Human Services, in Tuesday\u2019s election. The RSLC has spent more than $1.2 million this fall attacking Goodson and supporting Sterling.\n\nGoodson argued that the group\u2019s attacks over gifts from donors and a pay raise the high court requested last year were false and defamatory. Miller said Goodson\u2019s defamation claims were unlikely to succeed and that halting the ads would violate the First Amendment.\n\n\u201cEnjoining RSLC-JFI from further communicating or publishing its campaign advertisements would amount to a constitutionally impermissible prior restraint on speech,\u201d Miller wrote.\n\nA 15-second television ad from the group and a mailer cited a $50,000 trip to Italy that Goodson received in 2012 from W.H. Taylor, an attorney and friend of her husband\u2019s. Goodson says she has recused herself from cases involving her husband, Taylor or Tyson Foods Inc., a company Taylor has represented. Miller ruled that the group\u2019s claims regarding the gifts and donations were true \u201cin isolation\u201d and didn\u2019t explicitly connect them with any specific ruling by Goodson.\n\n\u201cAlthough nothing presented so far proves that Goodson has a bias in favor of particular litigants or lawyers, she has the burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, that RSLC-JFI acted with actual malice when it made these allegedly defamatory statements,\u201d he wrote.\n\nMiller also ruled that the justice was unlikely to prove the group acted with actual malice when it claimed she requested an $18,000 pay raise last year. Goodson testified Wednesday that she was one of two justices to vote privately against asking for the raise that the court\u2019s chief justice requested from a panel that sets elected state officials\u2019 salaries. The panel rejected the request and instead raised justices\u2019 pay by 2 percent, giving her a $3,330 raise.\n\nRSLC praised the ruling and said the decision, along with its criticism of the justice over the gifts and other issues, showed why she should be voted out next week.\n\n\u201cA much better judge than Courtney Goodson just tossed her latest, outrageous assault on the First Amendment,\u201d David James, a spokesman for the group, said in an email.\n\nA state judge in May temporarily blocked a TV ad from another group, the Judicial Crisis Network, against Goodson through that month\u2019s judicial election. Judicial Crisis Network, which is not required to disclose its donors, has not run any ads in the race since the May election.\n\nGoodson\u2019s attorney said the justice\u2019s court fight \u201cput sunshine\u201d on spending by outside groups.\n\n\u201cWhile we lost this battle against dark money this time, Justice Goodson returns today asking the voters to reject the efforts by these outsiders to hand pick someone for our state\u2019s Supreme Court,\u201d Lauren Hoover said in an email.\n\nGoodson, who lost her bid for chief justice two years ago after facing similar attack ads from Judicial Crisis, has drawn the ire of conservatives for past court rulings including a decision she authored striking down Arkansas\u2019 cap on punitive damages.\n\nArkansas\u2019 Supreme Court seats are nonpartisan, but Sterling and Goodson have both made appeals to the right. During her 2016 chief justice bid, Goodson had the endorsement of the National Rifle Association and vowed represent \u201cconservative\u201d values. Sterling, who ran unsuccessfully for the GOP nomination for attorney general four years ago, promotes his membership in the NRA and the Federalist Society in campaign literature.\n\nArkansas is one of several states where court races have become more partisan and negative, with outside groups spending big. RSLC, which launched its initiative focused on state court races in 2014, and its donors this year have included the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, tobacco company Reynolds American, Bentonville-based Wal-Mart Stores and other major corporations. The group spent nearly $745,000 on the high court race in the spring.\n\n___\n\nFollow Andrew DeMillo on Twitter: https://twitter.com/ademillo\n\n___\n\nFor the AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "Another NASA spacecraft runs out of steam, 2nd this week\n\nFILE - This illustration made available by NASA depicts the Dawn spacecraft orbiting the dwarf planet Ceres.

(Photo by Casey Curry/Invision/AP, File)\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Family members of Chris Cornell on Thursday sued a doctor they say overprescribed drugs to the rock singer, leading to his death.\n\nCornell\u2019s widow, Vicky Cornell, and their children, Toni and Christopher, are plaintiffs in the lawsuit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court alleging that prescription drugs, especially the anti-anxiety drug lorazepam, led to erratic behavior from the Soundgarden frontman before his death in Detroit in 2017 at age 52.\n\nThe lawsuit says Dr. Robert Koblin and his Beverly Hills office \u201cnegligently and repeatedly\u201d prescribed \u201cdangerous mind-altering controlled substances to Chris Cornell which impaired Mr. Cornell\u2019s cognition, clouded his judgment, and caused him to engage in dangerous impulsive behaviors that he was unable to control, costing him his life.\u201d\n\nIt focuses in particular on Koblin\u2019s prescribing Cornell large amounts of lorazepam \u2014 which is sold under the brand name Ativan \u2014 to Cornell in the 20 months leading up to his death. The lawsuit states Koblin and his office staff issued the prescriptions without the doctor physically examining or speaking to Cornell during that time period.\n\nCoroner\u2019s investigators ruled Cornell\u2019s death a suicide by hanging. Toxicology tests showed the presence of Ativan along with barbiturates, caffeine, the anti-opioid drug naloxone, and a decongestant.\n\nBut the autopsy report said the drugs were not a cause of death.\n\nThe lawsuit says Koblin knew Cornell had a serious history of substance abuse.\n\nThe \u201cunmonitored use of such excessive amounts of lorazepam ... was known to increase the risk of suicide because it can severely impair judgment, thinking and impulse control and diminish the ability of a patient to think and act rationally,\u201d the lawsuit says.\n\nStaff reached by phone at Koblin\u2019s office said there was no immediate comment.\n\nVicky Cornell has said since immediately after her husband\u2019s death that she felt the prescription drugs he was taking drove him to behave strangely, and there were no signs he might take his own life.\n\n\u201cAt the time of his death, Mr. Cornell had everything to live for and was planning a future of recordings, performances and continued work as a charitable activist,\u201d the lawsuit says.\n\nCornell\u2019s wailing voice and his long-haired, shirtless stage presence made him an essential figure in the grunge-rock of the 1990s. Soundgarden was among the first groups to surge to national attention in a wave that later included Nirvana, Pearl Jam and Alice in Chains.\n\nCornell also fronted the super-groups Audioslave with members of Rage Against The Machine and Temple of the Dog with members of Pearl Jam.\n\nLast month, a bronze statue of Cornell was erected outside the Museum of Pop Culture in Seattle.\n\nThe lawsuit, which seeks damages to be determined later, also names anonymous staffers at Koblin\u2019s office as defendants.\n\nCornell\u2019s oldest daughter, 18-year-old Lillian Jean Cornell-Silver, is also named as a defendant, but the lawsuit emphasizes that she is only included for procedural reasons.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that it is Cornell\u2019s oldest daughter Lillian Jean Cornell-Silver who is listed as a defendant for procedural reasons.\n\n___\n\nFollow Andrew Dalton on Twitter: https://twitter.com/andyjamesdalton .", "Airliner diverts to Los Angeles due to flap problem\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 A JetBlue flight from New York City to Long Beach, California, has landed safely after diverting to Los Angeles International Airport.\n\nFederal Aviation Administration spokesman Ian Gregor says Flight 213 from John F.

(Sean D. Elliot/The Day via AP, File)\n\nHARTFORD, Conn. (AP) \u2014 The Department of Homeland Security\u2019s inspector general is investigating allegations of racial discrimination at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy and inadequate follow-up by the school\u2019s leadership, the agency said Thursday.\n\nThe investigation will bring a new layer of scrutiny to the service academy that is already under pressure from Congress to address concerns about racial insensitivity, disparities in discipline and the administration\u2019s handling of complaints.\n\nThe probe began within the past few months and could take up to a year, Arlen Morales, a spokeswoman for the Office of Inspector General, told The Associated Press. It will look into how the academy responds to allegations of race or ethnicity-based discrimination. Ultimately, the academy will be required to provide a corrective action plan, with the inspector general\u2019s office updating Congress on any shortcomings.\n\nThe academy is cooperating with the investigation, spokesman David Santos said.\n\n\u201cIt is important for us to examine our policies and practices, and where necessary, take action to improve them,\u201d he said in a prepared statement.\n\nThe academy has made strides with mentoring programs and other initiatives to recruit and retain minorities, but it is also clear work remains to be done, said U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an issue that\u2019s got to once and for all get fixed,\u201d said Courtney, a Democrat whose district in eastern Connecticut includes the academy\u2019s New London campus. \u201cWhat I think is good about the IG\u2019s office is they give perspective in terms of solutions. That would be welcome.\u201d\n\nOne of the nation\u2019s smallest service academies, the Coast Guard Academy is overseen by Homeland Security, unlike others such as the U.S. Military Academy and the Naval Academy, which are run by the Defense Department. It enrolls over 1,000 cadets, who attend the school tuition-free and graduate as officers with a bachelor of science degree and a requirement to spend five years in the service.\n\nLike many other predominantly white institutions, it has struggled with diversity. This spring, it graduated its most diverse class ever, including 18 African-Americans in a class of 209 (8.6 percent), though last year it had only four black graduates in a class of 195 (2 percent).\n\nIn recent years, black cadets in particular have been raising concerns about the racial climate, including a perception that minorities are punished swiftly for slight infractions while others face little consequence for harassment. In one incident, when a white cadet played the song \u201cIf the South Woulda Won\u201d in a black cadet\u2019s room, the local NAACP said some were frustrated the white cadet was let off with an order to undergo sensitivity training.\n\nIn October, U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat and ranking member of the House Committee on Homeland Security, proposed legislation aimed at fostering a more inclusive environment at the academy. It calls for boosting geographic and racial diversity of cadets in part by requiring the academy to select up to half of each incoming class from a pool of candidates nominated by members of Congress.\n\nIn June, Thompson, Courtney and U.S. Rep. Elijah Cummings, of Maryland, asked the Coast Guard commandant for detailed information on harassment allegations and climate issues at the academy, requesting documents such as investigative reports within a month. Connecticut\u2019s two U.S. senators sent a similar letter. Courtney said the academy has provided hundreds of pages but has been asked to remove redactions.\n\nThe academy launched several initiatives to ensure all cadets feel welcome on campus. It invited a review by the University of Southern California\u2019s Center for Urban Education, which issued a report detailing disparities affecting black cadets in areas, including frequency of disciplinary action and graduation rates. The school\u2019s superintendent ordered a working group to look into factors behind the gaps.", "TENNESSEE (3-4) at DALLAS (3-4)\n\nMonday, 8:15 p.m. ET, ESPN\n\nOPENING LINE \u2014 Cowboys by 3\u00bd\n\nRECORD VS.

(AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais)\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 The United States has charged a government-controlled company in China with stealing trade secrets from an American semiconductor company, the Justice Department said Thursday as it outlined an initiative focused on what officials said was the growing threat of Chinese economic espionage.\n\nThe prosecution comes amid heightened trade tensions between China and the U.S. and as the Trump administration raises alarms that Beijing remains intent on stealing technology and inventions to gain an economic upper hand. The two nations have each imposed billions of dollars in tariffs on each other in a reflection of a confrontational relationship with national security as well as economic ramifications.\n\nThe case, which involves trade secrets worth up to $8.75 billion and allegedly stolen from Idaho-based Micron Technology Inc., is the latest in a series of prosecutions targeting Chinese corporate espionage. On Tuesday, for instance, federal prosecutors in California charged Chinese intelligence officers and hackers working for them with trying to steal information on commercial jet engines.\n\nOther cases have involved stolen wind turbine technology and software source code.\n\nThe Justice Department has charged companies in China and Taiwan and three individuals with stealing trade secrets from a U.S. semi-conductor company.

A Justice Department spokesman said the defendants were served summonses in Taiwan and that none is in U.S. custody.\n\nThe Chinese Embassy did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment Thursday.\n\nOne of the charged individuals had been general manager and chairman of a company that Micron acquired in 2013 and then went to work two years later for the Taiwan semiconductor company, United Microelectronics Corporation, or UMC, where prosecutors say he orchestrated the theft.\n\nThat man, identified by prosecutors as Chen Zhengkun, recruited both of his co-defendants to join him at UMC. One, according to prosecutors, downloaded more than 900 confidential and proprietary Micron files before he left and stored them in personal cloud storage and on external hard drives so that he could access them at his new job with UMC.\n\nThe company partnered with a Chinese-controlled business, Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Co., to mass-produce technology memory storage products used in computer electronics.\n\nThat technology, known as dynamic random-access memory, is something that the Chinese government had identified as an important priority because its own companies could not develop such advanced capabilities and had to rely on companies outside of China, the Justice Department said\n\nThe indictment was announced one day after the Trump administration imposed restrictions on technology exports to the Chinese company that was charged, citing national security concerns. Beijing has spent heavily to build up Jinhua and other chipmakers as part of efforts to transform China into a global leader in robotics, artificial intelligence and other technology industries.\n\nThe United States also Thursday sued to block the transfer of trade secrets and to prevent the companies from exporting to the U.S. any products that they manufacturing by exploiting stolen information.\n\nIn addition, the Justice Department announced an initiative to target Chinese economic espionage by identifying priority cases and ensuring there are enough resources available.\n\nThe administration has characterized China, along with Russia, as a strategic competitor of the United States. The U.S. has taken an increasingly confrontational stance toward what it characterizes as China\u2019s \u201cpredatory\u201d economic policies. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo set the tone in a June speech where he accused China of an \u201cunprecedented level of larceny\u201d of intellectual property.\n\nTensions over trade in particular have exacerbated relations between the two world powers. President Donald Trump has imposed tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese products in an effort to narrow the U.S. trade deficit with China. China has retaliated with tariff increases on $110 billion of American products.\n\nThe tensions have extended into security issues. China has criticized U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, which Beijing considers a renegade province, and the U.S. has renewed its criticism of China\u2019s island-building in the disputed South China Sea.

While dramatic, that was more than a foot lower than the 194 centimeters (76 inches) of water that devastated Venice in 1966.\n\nBut elsewhere in Italy, the death toll rose to at least 14 from the heavy rains and strong winds pummeling much of the country this week, and many regions warned that Thursday\u2019s storms could do more damage.\n\nTwo people were killed when a falling chestnut tree crushed their car in the mountainous northwest region of Val d\u2019Aosta.\n\nThe Italian news agency ANSA also reported Thursday that a man died of injuries suffered earlier this week when his car crashed into fallen trees in the Alpine region of South Tyrol.\n\nStorm damage also cut off roads to the picturesque western town of Portofino, leaving ferries the only transport to and from the Mediterranean port for the next few days.\n\nIn Florence, the Boboli Gardens, a popular tourist attraction where cypresses had fallen a few days ago, were reopened to visitors.\n\nIn Venice, in the heart of the city and near the Grand Canal, the wind and rain dealt St. Mark\u2019s Basilica its fifth most-serious flood in more than 900 years. The damage was concentrated in the atrium of the church, which is a fine example of Roman, Byzantine and Venetian culture. The basilica was re-opened to visitors on Wednesday.\n\nMany in Venice are hoping that an ambitious water engineering project nicknamed Moses \u2014 in reference to the Biblical figure \u2014 will spare the city from more disastrous flooding in the future. The project calls for underwater barriers that can be raised when a combination of high tides and strong winds is predicted to prevent waters from entering the lagoon and flooding the city. But the project has been plagued by cost overruns and corruption probes.\n\nThe moveable barrier project \u201cis the only one that can save the city of Venice from this type of event,\u201d Pierpaolo Campostrini, in charge of technical services to protect the basilica, told reporters this week.\n\nHe noted that when the base of the church\u2019s marble-covered columns are lapped by floodwaters \u2014 which happened in Monday\u2019s flooding \u2014 the salt in the water damages the bricks inside the columns.\n\nWhen the basilica was constructed, the lagoon\u2019s waters were some 1.7 meters (more than 5 \u00bd feet) lower than current levels, he said.", "GRAND JUNCTION, Colo.

State lawmakers passed a law mandating that all future kits be sent to the Oregon State Police for timely testing.\n\nIn this case, prosecutors alleged at a three-day bench trial that Moore lured the victim to a secluded part of a well-known waterfront park in Portland on June 14, 1996, and attacked her after she sat down.\n\n\u201cHis assault was immediate and brutal,\u201d Multnomah County Deputy District Attorney Tara Gardner said during her closing arguments.\n\nMoore then told the woman to turn her back to him and \u201cwalk three paces.\u201d She believed she was going to be shot as she did so, Gardner said.\n\nThe victim reported the attack to police and sought medical treatment that same day, but her rape kit would not be tested until authorities sent it to the private Utah lab using grant money.\n\nMoore\u2019s DNA was in a database because of previous criminal convictions, and he was arrested in Portland after the victim told authorities she wanted to go ahead with a prosecution.\n\nHe faces a minimum of more than eight years in prison at his sentencing next month.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Oregonian/OregonLive, http://www.oregonlive.com", "SAN JOSE, Calif.

(AP Photo/Michel Euler, File)\n\nPARIS (AP) \u2014 The biggest game of Gianluigi Buffon\u2019s career at Paris Saint-Germain has arrived sooner than expected.\n\nThe 40-year-old Italian will be in goal for PSG on Wednesday when it travels to play Napoli, where a loss would be a huge blow to the team\u2019s chances of advancing from the group stage of the Champions League.\n\nIt is exactly the type of high-pressure game which PSG signed Buffon for, although not this early. No doubt the club\u2019s cash-rich Qatari owners were hoping Buffon would be making his trademark saves in the semifinals or the final.\n\nPSG has not been past the quarterfinals since QSI took over in June 2011. The team has only four points from the first three group games and still has to face group leader Liverpool.\n\nThe atmosphere in the southern city of Naples is likely to be hostile, in particular for Buffon as a former Juventus player. Napoli\u2019s passionate tifosi will reserve a vitriolic reception for the goalkeeper, but he has seen and heard it all before.\n\nPSG coach Thomas Tuchel will certainly hope so, anyway, for he is facing the embarrassing prospect of becoming the first PSG coach not to qualify from the group stage since the vastly ambitious QSI took over seven years ago.\n\nTuchel has two very good goalkeepers, but clearly he has designated Buffon as first choice ahead of Alphonse Areola by picking him for Napoli. Areola played in the first three group games while Buffon was suspended.\n\nThe 25-year-old Areola is a homegrown player who has done well to force his way in at PSG.\n\nHe was particularly impressive in his France debut, making some spectacular saves in a 0-0 draw at Germany in the UEFA Nations League in September, and is unlucky in a sense that PSG signed Buffon.\n\nBut it is also true that, for such a high-pressure game, he simply does not have the stature as Buffon. Nor does he offer the immensely reassuring presence Buffon does.\n\nBuffon has been Serie A goalkeeper of the year 12 times, including the past four seasons.\n\n\u201cHe has a very important role for us because he\u2019s a legend. He\u2019s very important for us in terms of his approach to the sport,\u201d said Tuchel, who as a coach favoring a big work ethic could hardly have a better example than Buffon for his players to look up to.\n\nA World Cup winner with Italy in 2006, Buffon made 656 appearances for Juventus and 176 for Italy. He was expected to retire after winning a seventh straight Serie A title, but then PSG came calling and he took up the challenge of moving to a new league at an advanced age.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important that he\u2019s here and that he talks with everyone to share his experience,\u201d said Tuchel, adding that Buffon will be in goal for Friday\u2019s home game against second-place Lille.\n\nEarlier this season, Buffon showed that he has lost none of his sublime reflexes, making an astonishing save against Guingamp in a league game. Buffon looked beaten by striker Nolan Roux\u2019s shot as he dived to his left, but the Italian veteran showed astonishing agility to stick out his right hand and push the ball off the crossbar. It was a world class save few can do, but the type of save Buffon often does.\n\nThe only thing missing from Buffon\u2019s glittering career is a European Championship title \u2014 Italy lost the Euro 2012 final \u2014 and a Champions League title after losing in three finals with Juventus.\n\nBuffon will need a big performance against Napoli to keep that dream alive, which bodes rather well for PSG.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nJerome Pugmire on Twitter: www.twitter.com/jeromepugmire", "KENNEWICK, Wash.

(AP Photo/Sue Ogrtocki, File)\n\nOKLAHOMA CITY (AP) \u2014 Republican nominee for Oklahoma governor Kevin Stitt has been criticized by his Democrat opponent for his record as the head of a mortgage company.\n\nStitt, running as a businessman and outsider, is locked in a tight race against Democratic Drew Edmonson, a former attorney general who served 16 years before making an unsuccessful bid for governor in 2010.\n\nDemocrats have attacked the business record of Stitt, who founded Oklahoma-based Gateway Mortgage Group in 2000 and stepped down as the company\u2019s CEO in August, before he secured the GOP nomination in the race to replace term-limited Republican Gov. Mary Fallin.\n\nThe Democratic Governors Association takes aim at his history with Gateway in a television ad that began running earlier this month.\n\nA look at the claims:\n\nAD: \u201cStitt\u2019s company was ranked one of the shadiest mortgage lenders ... and has been sued dozens of times, and suspended in multiple states.\u201d\n\nTHE FACTS: It is true that Gateway was listed by a publication as one of the shadiest mortgage lenders and that the company has been sued dozens of times, though experts say such lawsuits are common for a mortgage company. It is false that the company was suspended in multiple states.\n\nAfter the 2008 financial crisis, the online publication Business Insider listed Gateway as one of the \u201c15 shadiest mortgage lenders\u201d being backed by the federal government.\n\nThe publication based its story on data from the Center for Public Integrity , a nonprofit investigative journalism organization, which compiled a list of troubled lenders in 2009 based on comparing a lender\u2019s default rates with other lenders in a geographic region. Gateway ranked tenth on the list for its above-average default rate of 11.9 percent.\n\nStephen Curry, Gateway\u2019s new CEO, acknowledged the company\u2019s high default rate at the time, noting the 2008 time period was a challenging one for the lending industry.\n\n\u201cGateway\u2019s performance may have been worse than average but nowhere extreme enough to be considered shady,\u201d Curry said in an interview with The Associated Press. He added that the company\u2019s foreclosures fell dramatically in later years.\n\nGateway has also been sued multiple times in several states for various allegations, including gender discrimination, breach of contract and fraud. Court records show cases against Gateway in recent years in Illinois, Missouri, Oklahoma and South Carolina.\n\nBut financial experts say it wouldn\u2019t be uncommon for a business of that size to run into problems with regulators during the financial crisis. The company currently has about 1,300 employees and operates in 41 states.\n\nNancy Titus-Piersma, a professor at Oklahoma State University\u2019s Spears School of Business, said while she isn\u2019t intimately familiar with Gateway\u2019s history, it was common for mortgage lenders to face lawsuits during the financial crisis, which exposed lenders for making risky loan offers and led to stricter regulations of the industry.\n\n\u201cThey weren\u2019t different from anybody else at that time in the industry,\u201d Titus-Piersma said. \u201cThat\u2019s just the way business was being done then. Was it right? No. But our country chose to have a regulatory environment that allowed it to happen.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s untrue, however, that Gateway\u2019s operations were suspended in multiple states. Democrats say Gateway\u2019s license was suspended in two states: Illinois and Georgia.\n\nThe AP reviewed actions taken in both states and found the company\u2019s license was only suspended in Georgia in 2009, amid allegations that the company made false statements and misrepresented facts to lenders, according to documents from the state\u2019s banking agency. In June, Stitt and Gateway reached an agreement with Georgia regulators that the company can reapply for a license at any time.\n\nIn Illinois banking officials issued an order to revoke the company\u2019s license, but Gateway appealed and reached a consent order with regulators that included a fine and a probationary period.\n\nEnforcement actions were taken against the company in at least seven other states, none of those allegations led to a suspension. In most cases, Gateway was assessed a civil penalty, took corrective action and remained licensed.\n\nStitt has acknowledged his company\u2019s missteps over the years and says that as CEO, he\u2019s handled those mistakes appropriately.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve paid for minor infractions in a couple of states over the years,\u201d Stitt said at a press conference earlier this year . \u201cHere\u2019s the deal: I hold people accountable.

(Emily Michot/Miami Herald via AP)\n\nMIAMI (AP) \u2014 The United States imposed new sanctions Thursday on Venezuela and Cuba and promised additional penalties against Nicaragua as the Trump administration laid out a hard-line policy toward countries the White House branded a \u201ctroika of tyranny.\u201d\n\nNational security adviser John Bolton condemned what he called the \u201cdestructive forces of oppression, socialism and totalitarianism\u201d that he said the three countries represent.\n\nIn a speech in Miami, home to thousands of exiles from Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua, Bolton said the U.S. \u201cwill no longer appease dictators and despots near our shores in this hemisphere.\u201d He spoke at the Freedom Tower, a building where Cubans fleeing the revolution led by Fidel Castro received U.S. government documents in the 1960s and early 1970s.\n\nThe new Venezuela sanctions target the country\u2019s gold sector, prohibiting U.S. citizens and entities from financial involvement in the trade.\n\nAmerican officials have said Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro illegally exported at least 21 metric tons of gold to Turkey to avoid U.S. sanctions and to try to help rescue a collapsing economy once bolstered by vast oil reserves.\n\nThe U.S. government has sanctioned dozens of top Venezuelan officials, including Maduro, as part of economic measures designed at pressuring the South American country\u2019s return to democracy.\n\nBolton said in response to questions after the speech that he doesn\u2019t expect the U.S. military would intervene in Venezuela. \u201cI don\u2019t see that happening,\u201d he said.\n\nBolton blamed Cuba for enabling Maduro\u2019s government and he urged the nations of the region to \u201clet the Cuban regime know that it will be held responsible for continued oppression in Venezuela.\u201d\n\nIn a contrast to the policy of the Obama administration, which restored diplomatic relations with Cuba, Bolton said Trump\u2019s State Department has added more than two dozen entities owned or controlled by the Cuban military and intelligence services to a restricted list of entities with which financial transactions by U.S. persons are prohibited.\n\nBolton said the goal is to prevent money from reaching the Cuban military, security and intelligence services.\n\nSouth Florida has long been home to a large community of Cubans emigres, many of whom will welcome a tougher line on the Havana government. In recent years, tens of thousands of Venezuelans have settled in the area as Venezuela\u2019s economy has collapsed. Bolton\u2019s speech may energize voters in both groups heading into Tuesday\u2019s elections.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt the speech had an electoral purpose,\u201d said Harold Trinkunas, deputy director of the Center for International Security and Cooperation at Stanford University. \u201cThe timing and the location have an electoral impact and Florida is an important state for the Republican Party.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, Trinkunas said the approach of imposing sanctions on the gold industry is a sign of how important the metal has become to Maduro\u2019s effort to prop up the Venezuelan economy.\n\nBolton also sent a strong warning to President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua, where more than 300 people have been killed since protests erupted in April calling for Ortega\u2019s resignation.\n\n\u201cFree, fair, and early elections must be held in Nicaragua, and democracy must be restored to the Nicaraguan people,\u201d he said. \u201cUntil then, the Nicaraguan regime, like Venezuela and Cuba, will feel the full weight of America\u2019s robust sanctions regime.\u201d\n\nIn grouping the three countries together, Bolton said \u201cthis troika of tyranny, this triangle of terror stretching from Havana to Caracas to Managua, is the cause of immense human suffering, the impetus of enormous regional instability, and the genesis of a sordid cradle of communism in the Western Hemisphere.\u201d\n\nBolton mocked the leaders, comparing them to The Three Stooges. \u201cThese tyrants fancy themselves strongmen and revolutionaries, icons and luminaries,\u201d he said. \u201cIn reality, they are clownish, pitiful figures more akin to Larry, Curly, and Moe.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, Bolton called Brazil\u2019s president-elect, Jair Bolsonaro, a \u201clikeminded leader\u201d and said his election last weekend demonstrates \u201ca growing regional commitment to free-market principles, and open, transparent, and accountable governance.\u201d\n\nBolsonaro whose victory moved Brazil sharply to the right, built his popularity on a mixture of often outrageous comments and hard-line positions, but he consolidated his lead by promising to enact market-friendly reforms.\n\n_____\n\nAlonso reported from Washington.", "Arsenal manager Unai Emery gestures, during the English League Cup 4th round soccer match between Arsenal and Blackpool, at the emirates Stadium, in London, Wednesday, Oct. 31, 2018. (Nigel French/PA via AP)\n\nIt\u2019s time to find out if Unai Emery\u2019s new-look Arsenal is the real deal.\n\nSince losing its opening two games of the season to Manchester City and then Chelsea, Arsenal has taken advantage of a relatively benign schedule to win 12 of its next 13 matches \u2014 and draw the other \u2014 in all competitions.\n\nA strong platform has been laid: The team is in fourth place in the league, is through to the quarterfinals of the English League Cup , and is virtually assured of advancing to the knockout stage of the Europa League.\n\nThere\u2019s a sense that Arsenal still has something to prove, however, ahead of the visit of unbeaten Liverpool on Saturday in the Premier League.\n\nWho is the first-choice goalkeeper: Offseason signing Bernd Leno or Petr Cech, who started the season in goal and has just returned from injury?\n\nIs the defense sturdy enough? It has kept only two clean sheets in 10 league games, and there are doubts about the flimsiness and lack of pace at center back.\n\nIs Mesut Ozil really back to his best? The languid playmaker followed up his best performance of the season \u2014 in a 3-1 win over Leicester \u2014 with a frustratingly lackluster display in the 2-2 draw at Crystal Palace on Sunday that led to him being substituted in the 68th minute. That draw at Palace ended Arsenal\u2019s 11-game winning run.\n\nAnd does Emery truly know how best to set out his strikeforce? He has switched between playing Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette as the sole striker, with Aubameyang having to settle for a substitute\u2019s role or a place on the left wing.\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise there are still some teething problems in the Arsenal side. After all, Emery is attempting to stamp his own mark on the team after replacing Arsene Wenger, Arsenal\u2019s coach of nearly 22 years. That includes a stronger emphasis on playing the ball out from the back and adopting a more intense pressing game in midfield.\n\nExpectations no doubt have been exceeded in the first three months of the season, with Emery receiving a period of grace from Arsenal supporters. But Liverpool, and revitalized forward Mohamed Salah, could give Arsenal a reality check at Emirates Stadium on Saturday.\n\nSalah, who has scored in each of his last three club games, and Sadio Mane, who struck twice against Cardiff last weekend, look in the kind of form to prey on Arsenal\u2019s defensive frailties \u2014 as Liverpool has done as a team in scoring 17 goals in its last five matches against Arsenal in the Premier League.\n\nIn its last two visits to the Emirates, Liverpool has scored seven goals and the games have been end-to-end classics that always suit Juergen Klopp\u2019s side.\n\nEmery has brought a measure of control to Arsenal \u2014 Lucas Torreira, the offseason signing from Sampdoria, has brought a much-needed assuredness in midfield, for example \u2014 and got its forward line clicking. Arsenal has scored at least two goals in every league game since losing 2-0 at home to City on the opening weekend.\n\nLiverpool, though, has conceded only four goals in 10 league games, with its stingy defense proving to be as much of an asset as its prolific forward line that carried the team to the Champions League final last season.\n\nSomething has to give on Saturday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Sports: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nSteve Douglas is at www.twitter.com/sdouglas80", "WEST HAVEN, Conn.

(AP) \u2014 The Office of the State Auditor in New Mexico has served as a springboard for aspiring politicians and has made headlines for some of its special investigations.\n\nThe candidates vying for the seat both have said they aim to continue using its power to hold local and state government accountable.\n\nRepublican Wayne Johnson was appointed to the office last year and is running for a full term. He\u2019s being challenged by Brian Colon, a former chairman of the state Democratic Party.\n\n___\n\nTHE OFFICE:\n\nThe auditor\u2019s office ensures that the finances of government agencies, school districts, universities and other public organizations that receive tax dollars are examined annually. That work is often done by independent auditors overseen by the state auditor.\n\nThe office also promotes transparency and conducts special investigations. Its mantra has been to stamp out fraud, waste and abuse.\n\nA review in 2015 and 2016 by the agency underscored the extent of New Mexico\u2019s backlog when it came to processing evidence kits in sexual assault cases, finding that New Mexico had more untested kits per capita than any other state.\n\nThe office also investigated the University of New Mexico\u2019s troubled athletics department, finding among other things that the school overpaid three coaches and provided perks to some people who didn\u2019t donate money to the university or its fundraising arms.\n\n___\n\nTHE CANDIDATES:\n\nIf Johnson were to win, he would be the first Republican to be elected to the post in decades.\n\nA former commissioner in New Mexico\u2019s most populous county, Johnson was appointed to the position last December to fill the vacancy created when Democrat Tim Keller stepped down to become Albuquerque mayor.\n\nOver the last several months, Johnson has issued warnings about a development project in Alamogordo and detailed spending on flowers and employee bonuses by an organization that provides services for senior citizens. Most recently, he entered an agreement to help New Mexico courts in identifying guardians and conservators who are mismanaging or misspending funds that belong to vulnerable adults.\n\n___\n\nAn Albuquerque attorney, Colon has a finance degree and has represented business and governmental entities.\n\nHe once served as Democratic Party chairman and winning the auditor\u2019s seat would end a political drought for him. Colon ran unsuccessfully for lieutenant governor in 2010 and for Albuquerque mayor last year.\n\nColon has said that while the Office of the State Auditor has been effective, it faces challenges that include budget cuts in recent years. His priorities include encouraging more outreach with the public and promoting the agency\u2019s fraud hotline.\n\nColon has been able to out-fundraise Johnson over the course of the campaign. According finance reports filed with the state, the Democrat has brought in more than $330,000 in contributions and has spent about half of that. Johnson\u2019s contributions total about $167,000.", "FILE - This combination of file photos shows Wisconsin Republican Gov. Scott Walker, left, and his Democratic challenger Tony Evers in the 2018 November general election. (Wisconsin State Journal via AP, File)\n\nMADISON, Wis. (AP) \u2014 Republican Gov. Scott Walker, locked in a tight re-election bid, said Thursday for the first time that he wants to enact the \u201cexact same language\u201d that\u2019s in federal law at the state level guaranteeing insurance for people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nHowever, the proposal would not protect as many people as the federal law does and it\u2019s unclear whether there\u2019s enough support in the Republican-controlled Legislature to pass it.\n\nWalker previously supported a bill to guarantee coverage that was not as expansive as what is guaranteed under the federal Affordable Care Act. That bill stalled in the state Senate.\n\nWalker\u2019s new promise, made to reporters following a campaign stop in Waukesha as he faces the toughest election of his political career, was derided as a lie by Democratic challenger Tony Evers. A Marquette University Law School poll on Wednesday showed the race to be a dead heat, with health care as a top issue.\n\n\u201cNo matter what happens in the courts or in the Congress, in Wisconsin we\u2019ll codify that, the exact same language that\u2019s in the Affordable Care Act. We\u2019ll make sure everyone living with a pre-existing condition is covered here in the state,\u201d Walker said.\n\nWalker is a longtime opponent of the federal law and this year approved Wisconsin joining a federal lawsuit seeking its full repeal, including the popular protection for people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nThe Assembly passed the more limited bill earlier this year, but it died in the Senate. A spokesman for Republican Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald declined to comment Thursday, and he seesawed last month on whether the original proposal had the votes to pass. Assembly Speaker Robin Vos did not return a message.\n\nAlso, a state law like Walker is promising would not protect everyone.\n\nIf the federal law is overturned, people in Wisconsin who get their insurance through a self-funded employer plan would lose their protections because only the federal government can regulate those plans, the nonpartisan Legislative Council said in an Oct. 18 memo.\n\nMore than 150 companies in Wisconsin have self-funded plans, including Kimberly-Clark Corp., Kwik Trip, Kohler Co., Schneider National and Snap-On, Inc.\n\nEvers said in a statement that \u201cactions speak louder than words\u201d and Walker\u2019s long-held opposition to the federal law and its protections for people with pre-existing conditions shows he can\u2019t be trusted.\n\n\u201cPoliticians like Scott Walker are always talking out of both sides of their mouth and telling last-minute lies like this,\u201d Evers said.\n\nThe fight played out as Walker, Evers and other candidates were blanketing the state, with surrogates including House Speaker Paul Ryan and White House counselor Kellyanne Conway in tow.\n\nRepublican Senate candidate Leah Vukmir was campaigning with Ryan and Walker on a bus tour from Waukesha to Green Bay. Vukmir had a separate stop with Conway in Appleton. She also won the endorsement of former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice on Thursday.\n\nEvers is on his own tour \u2014 in a yellow school bus \u2014 through western and northern Wisconsin starting in Tomah and ending in Ashland. Baldwin was campaigning in Marshfield and Mauston before ending in Madison where she urged college students to vote early, before casting her own ballot. She said it was the first time she\u2019s ever voted early in an election where she was on the ballot.\n\nEvers launched a new campaign ad Thursday emphasizing criticism of Walker from four of his former Cabinet secretaries. Three of them signed a letter urging a vote for Evers, while a fourth said Walker was not being truthful about his roads budget.\n\nWalker, who is seeking a third term, has dismissed the criticism saying it shows he\u2019s willing to surround himself with people who have differing viewpoints.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The widows of two police officers the Mexican immigrant murdered were invited to President Donald Trump\u2019s 2017 address to Congress. The conservative Breitbart News faithfully chronicled his conviction and death sentence. His snarling, expletive-filled rant about killing police officers appeared in a little-noticed January 2018 Trump campaign ad.\n\nNow, Luis Bracamontes\u2019 menacing smile has abruptly taken a central role in Trump\u2019s closing midterm election argument about immigration as the president tweeted out a video of the Latino man\u2019s courtroom appearance in what was immediately denounced by some Democrats and Republicans as a racist campaign tactic.\n\nBracamontes, an immigrant living in the country illegally, sports a shaved head and long chin hair and speaks in accented English in the video, and his words are clear: He\u2019s killed cops and he\u2019s \u201cgonna kill more cops soon.\u201d\n\nThe video , which Trump tweeted late Wednesday, alleges without evidence that Democrats were responsible for allowing Bracamontes into the U.S. It comes amid a frenzy of hardline immigration proposals pushed out by Trump in the final stages of the campaign, including sending troops to the border and revoking birthright citizenship.\n\nPresident Donald Trumps tweeted a video likening Central American immigrants to dangerous criminals. It has been roundly criticized as racist and reminiscent of the infamous \"Willie Horton\" ad used in the 1988 presidential campaign. (Nov. 1)\n\nBracamontes, a twice-deported immigrant from Mexico, was sentenced to death in California for the 2014 killings. The 53-second video includes expletives uttered by Bracamontes during his trial as he professed regret at not killing more officers.\n\n\u201cIllegal immigrant, Luis Bracamontes, killed our people!,\u201d the video states, adding, \u201cDemocrats let him into our country ... Democrats let him stay.\u201d It includes scenes of a migrant caravan moving toward the U.S., warning ominously, \u201cWho else would Democrats let in?\u201d and suggesting that more violence would soon penetrate the border.\n\nThe ad was reminiscent of the infamous \u201cWillie Horton\u201d ad used against Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis in 1988 and condemned as racist. Horton, who was black, raped a woman while out of prison on a weekend furlough. As Massachusetts governor, Dukakis supported the furlough program. Dukakis went on to lose to Republican George H.W. Bush.\n\nThe video tweeted by Trump did not immediately appear to be running on television \u2014 it has a runtime longer than most TV ads \u2014 although it received extensive coverage on cable news networks. As of Thursday afternoon, it had received 3.51 million views in less than 24 hours and was the \u201cpinned\u201d tweet atop Trump\u2019s profile, meaning it was the first thing any visitor to his Twitter page would see.\n\nThe White House and the Trump campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comments as to who made or paid for the video or if any tax dollars were used to run it from the president\u2019s account.\n\n\u201cThis is a sickening ad. Republicans everywhere should denounce it,\u201d said Republican Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona, a frequent Trump critic. And Rep. Carlos Curbelo, R-Fla., seeking re-election in a Democratic-leaning South Florida district, said he\u2019d not seen the video but criticized Trump\u2019s use of it.\n\n\u201cI can tell you that it\u2019s definitely part of a divide-and-conquer strategy that a lot of politicians, including the president, have used successfully in the past,\u201d Curbelo said Thursday on CNN. \u201cI hope this doesn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nTom Perez, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, called the new ad the \u201cdog whistle of all dog whistles.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is distracting, divisive Donald at his worst,\u201d Perez said on CNN. \u201cThis is fearmongering.\u201d\n\nThe dark video stood in stark contrast to an ad circulated by the Trump campaign earlier in the week that highlighted rosy economic numbers and depicted gauzy scenes of American suburban life. That ad was part of a blitz by Trump\u2019s campaign, and his campaign manager, Brad Parscale, did several interviews to promote it.\n\nAs for the new video, though, the campaign was silent Thursday and Parscale did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nBut the Trump campaign was behind the January 2018 video, released on its YouTube page, that featured Bracamontes\u2019s courtroom appearance. That video was timed to the one-year anniversary of Trump\u2019s inauguration and meant to promote his immigration agenda.\n\nThe previous year, Jessica Davis and Susan Oliver, the widows of Detective Michael Davis and Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver, were invited to Trump\u2019s address to Congress. Bracamontes\u2019 case \u2014 he was sentenced to death in March \u2014 also received steady coverage on Breitbart and other right-wing news sites.\n\nTrump has long promoted the alleged danger presented by those living in the country illegally, although statistics show they do not commit crimes at a higher rate than citizens. During his 2016 campaign, he frequently appeared with so-called \u201cangel families\u201d \u2014 those who lost loved ones at the hands of immigrants in the nation illegally.\n\n___\n\nFollow Lemire on Twitter at http://twitter.com/@JonLemire and Miller at http://twitter.com/@zekejmiller", "KANSAS CITY (7-1) at CLEVELAND (2-5-1)\n\nSunday, 1 p.m. CBS\n\nOPENING LINE \u2014 Chiefs by 7 \u00bd\n\nRECORD VS.

Will Hurd, R-Texas, waits to speak to students during a stop at the Texas A&M-San Antonio, Tuesday, Oct. 23, 2018, in San Antonio. Hurd, one of President Donald Trump\u2019s few Republican critics in Congress is trying to hang on for another term in a Texas swing district. (AP Photo/Eric Gay)\n\nSAN ANTONIO (AP) \u2014 Few Republicans in Congress have publicly criticized President Donald Trump like Will Hurd of Texas, who didn\u2019t vote for him in 2016 and won\u2019t say if he will in 2020. But next week on Election Day, Hurd could end up helping save him.\n\nOne of just three black Republicans in Congress, Hurd drew national attention this summer for accusing Trump of \u201cstanding idle on the world stage\u201d and being manipulated by Russian President Vladimir Putin. He represents a Hispanic-majority district won by Hillary Clinton in 2016, which, in this deeply divisive election year, should point to him being toast.\n\nBut back home along the U.S.-Mexico border, Hurd hangs on by a thread in his bid for a third term, potentially depriving the Democrats of one of the 23 additional seats it needs to retake the House.\n\nHurd, who squeaked out his last two elections by 5,500 votes combined, has figured out how to survive in Texas\u2019 only swing district by being the rare swing candidate.\n\nSome signs of that are even literal: Steve Armstrong waved a yard sign for Beto O\u2019Rourke, the surprising Democratic U.S. Senate challenger, outside a polling station in a San Antonio neighborhood last week as Hurd greeted early voters in the rain. But when Armstrong spotted the congressman and approached, it wasn\u2019t to lay into him.\n\n\u201cI gotta tell you I\u2019m a Beto guy, but I\u2019m all for people working across the aisle and getting some common-sense stuff done,\u201d Armstrong told Hurd. \u201cRight-wing, left-wing, it\u2019s killing this country.\u201d\n\nThe race is a rare and striking example of a vocal Trump critic in the GOP proving durable at a time when other vulnerable Republicans are moving closer \u2014 not away \u2014 from the combative president. In Florida, Republican congressman Carlos Curbelo is another moderate and Trump critic also trying to defy the political forces working to polarize.\n\nIf they win, Hurd and Curbelo will likely spotlight a survival strategy for Republicans in places where Democrats otherwise prosper.\n\nHurd has kept a distance from Trump both politically and in proximity: He skipped the president\u2019s rally in Houston this month and wasn\u2019t mentioned by the president.\n\n\u201cThe people that I care about mentioning me are the folks walking by here,\u201d Hurd said, adding, \u201cI have an independent relationship with people.\u201d\n\nHurd grew up in San Antonio with conservative parents and went to Texas A&M University, becoming student body president. After graduating he went to the CIA, where he worked as an intelligence officer in India, Pakistan and Afghanistan, where he says he managed undercover operations. He jokes that his campaign team wants pictures from his time at the agency but says that \u201cfolks in West Texas don\u2019t want to see me looking like a Taliban.\u201d\n\nHis sprawling 800-mile district, which spans two time zones and is larger than 26 states, ping-ponged between being held by Republicans and Democrats before Hurd pulled off a slim re-election victory in 2016. The heart of the district is San Antonio, where a heavy military presence lends a conservative tilt.\n\nBut it\u2019s also 70 percent Hispanic with more than half of families speaking a language other than English at home \u2014 a Democrat-friendly trait.\n\nHurd has handled the balance by being a Republican known for his dissent within the party. He mocks Trump\u2019s proposed border wall, acknowledges man-made climate change as real and supports a path to citizenship for so-called \u201cDreamers\u201d who weren\u2019t born in the U.S. but brought to the country as children by their immigrant parents.\n\nHis opponent, Democrat Gina Ortiz Jones, calls him a phony whose record in Congress shows a Republican nearly in lockstep with his party, including Hurd voting in favor of a spending bill that included border wall funding. Hurd has said he was voting for provisions, including a military pay raise.\n\nTo be sure, Hurd walks a fine line in the fights he picks with Trump. He demurred when asked whether he believed Trump was trying to stoke racial anxieties before Election Day by issuing dark warnings about a caravan of Central American migrants heading toward the U.S. border.\n\nJones, an Air Force veteran making her first run for office, would make history as Texas\u2019 first openly gay and Filipina-American member of Congress. She has outraised Hurd, and the congressional Republicans\u2019 fundraising arm recently went back on TV attacking her.\n\nHis pitch doesn\u2019t matter, she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to hear the words. You just have to watch the votes.\u201d\n\nJim Randall, 55, has watched the votes, and after casting his ballot for Hurd, he swung by on his way out to give the congressman a piece of his mind over supporting young immigrants.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry man, but they gotta go. I\u2019ve always voted for you, and I sure as hell wouldn\u2019t vote for Ortiz,\u201d Randall told Hurd. \u201cBut I\u2019m pretty disappointed in you.\u201d\n\nHurd said he appreciated the feedback, and they parted with a hand shake.\n\n__\n\nFollow Paul J.

(AP) \u2014 Montana election officials want to keep tabs on two foreign observers who will be in the state for routine monitoring of next week\u2019s elections, including where they are staying, what questions they are asking and what documents they are seeking.\n\nA memo sent Sunday from Secretary of State Corey Stapleton\u2019s office to county election officials says observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe are expected in Montana. The Independent Record newspaper, which first reported about the memo, published a copy of it Thursday.\n\n\u201cIf you happen to have an encounter with any member of the group ... you will need to provide me with the following information as soon as possible,\u201d according to the memo by Stapleton\u2019s director of elections and voter services, Dana Corson.\n\nThe document includes a checklist of questions, including the circumstances surrounding the contact with the foreign observer, questions asked and information supplied, access or documents requested and provided, and their plans for staying in that location.\n\nThe OSCE observers appear to be performing routine election observation at the invitation of the United States, one of the 57 nations that are members of the organization created during the Cold War as a bridge between East and West. The organization observes elections around the world and has monitored seven elections in the U.S. since 2002, most recently in 2016.\n\nPaulette DeHart, clerk and recorder for Lewis and Clark County, said Thursday that it\u2019s common for county election officials to host individuals who want to view the election process, including foreigners.\n\n\u201cWe do that for everybody, no matter who they are or where they\u2019re from,\u201d she said. \u201cThey don\u2019t have access to ballots, they don\u2019t have access to the equipment.\u201d\n\nOfficials with the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights in Poland did not immediately return an after-hours call for comment. The office describes its election mission to the U.S. on its website and says 13 experts will be based in Washington, while 36 observers are deployed in teams of two to various states.\n\nThe observers will monitor voter registration, campaign activities, media coverage and Election Day procedures. They will compile their observations in a report that will be shared with the public and the U.S. government.\n\nCorson said in his memo to county officials that he was recently told two observers would arrive in the state after Sunday and would be looking to meet with various people. He said one visitor would be a Pakistani national and that \u201canyone in the group is of interest, but in particular \u2014 the female observer is of high interest.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not clear to whom he was referring, what he means by \u201chigh interest\u201d or why it matters that one would be from Pakistan, a U.S. ally. A list of the election observers published by the OSCE does not include anybody from Pakistan.\n\nCorson, in response to an Associated Press query, said, \u201cI just shared what I knew.\u201d He said he wrote the memo \u201cbased on my conversations with the FBI\u201d but said this appears to be like any other election year with foreign observers.\n\n\u201cI have no more concerns with this information than I already did with regard to running secure elections next week,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just another data point that I am managing.\u201d\n\nCorson also instructed county officials not to share the memo and labeled it as \u201cunclassified controlled information for official use only,\u201d a term defined in U.S. Department of Defense regulations but not by Montana state laws that regulate public access to records.\n\n\u201cThe information contained is only to be shared by those within your organization who have demonstrated a need to know,\u201d Corson wrote.\n\nHe told the AP on Thursday that he was wrong to try to prevent the memo\u2019s disclosure.\n\n\u201cI am sending out a clarification to the clerks that this information is Unclassified,\u201d Corson wrote. \u201cI was simply trying to be discreet in notifying the clerks about foreign observers just showing up unannounced.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Independent Record, http://www.helenair.com", "NEW YORK JETS (3-5) at MIAMI (4-4)\n\nSunday, 1 p.m. ET, CBS\n\nOPENING LINE - Dolphins by 3\n\nRECORD VS.

Oregon will have extra motivation after being blown out on the road against Arizona last week, dropping the Ducks out of the AP Top 25.\n\nMATCHUP OF THE WEEK: Stanford at Washington. The loser on Saturday could find itself in a difficult spot in the Pac-12 North race. No. 10 Washington State leads at 4-1, with the Huskies a half-game behind. The Cardinal are a game back after losing to the Cougars last week. Stanford won last year\u2019s meeting 30-22 behind Bryce Love\u2019s 166 yards rushing.

Democrat Rachel Crooks is a first-time candidate trying to win a House seat in Ohio's District 88.

The former Trump Tower receptionist said she was 22 when she introduced herself to him in 2006 and that he kissed her \u201cdirectly on the mouth\u201d against her will.\n\nTrump has denied her claims more than once, tweeting in February he didn\u2019t know her. \u201cNever happened! Who would do this in a public space with live security.\u201d\n\nCrooks, who works for a small university in Ohio recruiting international students, first thought the idea of entering politics was crazy.\n\nShe worried about putting her life on hold. She wondered if others would again question her motives for telling her story about Trump.\n\n\u201cI could have very much not said another word, but the fact is I had been given this voice,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd what I did with it was up to me.\u201d\n\nHer campaign has struck a chord with women and Democrats. She\u2019s pulled in a surprising number of donations from every state, the majority in small amounts.\n\nCrooks readily admits she\u2019s in an uphill battle, trying to win in a rural area of Ohio southeast of Toledo that Democrats last held in 1994. But the party thinks she has a shot in what it considers a swing district. Trump easily won the counties within the district in 2016.\n\nHer opponent, Republican Bill Reineke, is seeking a third term and has a name most people know because he and his family own a string of car dealerships in the area.\n\nHis campaign didn\u2019t respond to several messages seeking comment about the race. Reineke did say in a statement this year \u2014 after Crooks announced her plans to run \u2014 that sexual harassment has no place in society and victims deserve to be heard.\n\n\u201cThis campaign is not about the individuals running; it\u2019s about the people they would ultimately represent,\u201d he said.\n\nCrooks said when she\u2019s canvassing the small towns that make up Ohio\u2019s 88th House district most people want to talk about health care costs, a lack of high-wage jobs and a controversial wind turbine project in the area.\n\nThe president often comes up too. But she doesn\u2019t think she\u2019s being inauthentic by not bringing up her #MeToo moment. \u201cIt\u2019s understanding your audience and what issues are a concern to people,\u201d she said.\n\nSeveral of her tweets and fundraising pitches do mention it though.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not afraid to speak up for what\u2019s right even when it\u2019s against one of the most powerful men in the world,\u201d she said in one tweet.\n\nA fundraising email sent in mid-October noted it had been two years since she told her story.\n\nCrooks, who grew up in the area she wants to represent, isn\u2019t entirely new to campaigning.

It centered on a program called the HUD-VA Supporting Housing Program, which Congress boosted funds for in 2008.\n\nIt gives homeless veterans permanent housing while also providing them a case manager and clinical care services. The old way required treatment for mental health issues and drug and alcohol addiction before being able to qualify for a home.\n\nOfficials attributed the small uptick in 2017 largely to the high cost of housing in Los Angeles, which has the second-largest homeless population in the U.S. and the largest homeless veteran population.\n\nHUD said veteran homelessness decreased from 2017 to 2018 in California.\n\nVeterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie said he plans to visit Los Angeles this week to meet with local officials and charities to discuss what further support is needed in their efforts.

(AP) \u2014 The Arkansas Supreme Court on Thursday struck down a law that gives the state\u2019s prison director authority to determine whether an inmate is mentally competent to be put to death, siding with two convicted murderers who were spared from execution last year.\n\nIn two 4-3 rulings, justices ruled the competency law violated due process rights guaranteed in the Arkansas and U.S. Constitutions. Convicted murderers Bruce Ward and Jack Greene were granted stays last year so the court could hear their cases. Arkansas has no executions scheduled, and lacks two of the three drugs needed for its lethal injection process.\n\nThe rulings, which reverse a judge\u2019s decision to dismiss the lawsuits, revives the inmates\u2019 efforts to challenge their competency to be executed.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re pleased the court held the statute unconstitutional, and we look forward to litigating our clients\u2019 competence,\u201d John C. Williams, a federal public defender representing the inmates, said in an email.\n\nWard was one of eight inmates whom Arkansas planned to execute in April 2017. Ward and three other inmates were granted stays, and the state ultimately executed four men over an eight-day period that month. Greene was scheduled to be put to death in November, but that was also halted.\n\nWard has been on death row since 1990 for the death of Rebecca Lynn Doss, and his attorneys said he\u2019s a diagnosed schizophrenic. Attorneys for Greene, who was sentenced to death for the 1991 slaying of Sidney Burnett, said he suffers from psychotic delusions and believes the attorneys and prison officials have conspired to torture him.\n\nJustices on Thursday also rejected Greene\u2019s argument that executing him after 25 years in solitary confinement would be cruel and unusual punishment and violate his constitutional rights, ruling the lower court was correct to dismiss that part of his lawsuit.\n\nArkansas prison officials have put their search for new execution drugs on hold until the Legislature expands its execution drug secrecy law to include manufacturers. An attorney for the state in August said it was highly unlikely Arkansas would obtain new drugs or set execution dates before next spring.\n\nA spokeswoman for Attorney General Leslie Rutledge said she was disappointed in the rulings and was reviewing the decisions to consider further options.\n\n___\n\nFollow Andrew DeMillo on Twitter at www.twitter.com/ademillo", "Stefanowski says Lamont\u2019s Senate rival will be an adviser\n\nHARTFORD, Conn.

(AP) \u2014 The private utility that spent billions of dollars on the construction of two nuclear reactors in South Carolina which were abandoned without generating any power said government watchdogs should bear much of the responsibility for the debacle.\n\nA lawyer for South Carolina Electric & Gas made a rare public statement for the company Thursday during opening statements in what\u2019s likely to be weeks of hearings before the Public Service Commission.\n\nThe Office of Regulatory Staff has already said executives of SCE&G and its parent company SCANA Corp. lied about problems and cost overruns on the two reactors it was trying to build at the V.C. Summer plant.\n\nThey also said the same state law that allowed SCE&G to raise rates nine times to pay for the plant before it was finished also tied its hands, forcing agency employees to care more about the concerns of the utilities than customers.\n\nThe hearings before regulators have high stakes for SCE&G. The seven Public Service Commission members are trying to set electric rates. Environmental and consumer groups and many lawmakers want all or most of the $2 billion paid to the utility for the failed plants to be returned. That would knock up to $27 off the average monthly bill.\n\nSCE&G said that would cause the utility to go bankrupt.\n\nThe hearing will include weeks of complex testimony. Fourteen different entities, from a customer, to a lawyer for the Legislature, the Department of Defense, the state Attorney General\u2019s Office and the state\u2019s electric cooperatives all gave opening statements.\n\nAttorney David Balser started his opening statement apologizing to customers on SCE&G\u2019s behalf. He then said the company has unfairly shouldered all the blame.\n\nSCE&G would still be plugging away on the reactors if it wasn\u2019t for the bankruptcy of Westinghouse, which was the contractor building the reactors, and the decision in the summer of 2017 by state-owned utility Santee Cooper with its 45 percent share in the project to give up.\n\n\u201cSuccess has many fathers, but failure is an orphan,\u201d Balser said.\n\nEarlier in the day, attorney Robert Guild, working for the Sierra Club, said SCE&G willful mismanagement of the project was like killing someone, and its demands that rates not be significantly reduced was a stick-up meant to benefit shareholders and executives.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if we\u2019ve been confronted by a murder, followed by an armed robbery,\u201d Guild said.\n\nAn important sidebar to the rate argument is what happens to SCANA. Dominion Energy from Virginia has made a bid to take over the company, by offering two plans \u2014 either give customers a rebate of up to $1,000 with a smaller rate cut or no refund and a slightly bigger rate cut. Dominion will withdraw the merger if the rate increases are rolled back as far as the Office of Regulatory Staff wants, utility attorney Joe Reed said.\n\n\u201cThe ORS is going for broke here, and they may end up with just that \u2014 a broken utility,\u201d Reed said.\n\nSCE&G customer William Dowdy told commissioners he didn\u2019t have all the answers, but he asked them to be skeptical of everyone, especially companies and utilities that promise a lot.\n\nHe cited Dominion\u2019s ads touting the refund. They say \u201cthat\u2019s a lot of groceries,\u201d Dowdy said. \u201cNo, that\u2019s a lot of baloney.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Jeffrey Collins at https://twitter.com/JSCollinsAP, read his work at https://apnews.com/search/jeffrey%20collins", "FILE - In this Feb. 10, 2016, file photo, the closed LTV Steel taconite plant is abandoned near Hoyt Lakes, Minn.

(AP Photo/Jim Mone, File)\n\nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 Minnesota regulators on Thursday granted key permits to the long-planned PolyMet copper-mining project that\u2019s opposed by environmentalists who fear it could someday foul waters, including Lake Superior.\n\nThe state Department of Natural Resources issued permits to PolyMet Mining Inc. for the company\u2019s proposed NorthMet project in northeastern Minnesota.

The project would be located near tributaries feeding the St. Louis River, 175 river miles upstream from Lake Superior.\n\nDuluth for Clean Water said the proposed mine \u201cwould create permanent, toxic pollution in the headwaters of Lake Superior, putting our communities and lives in constant danger.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe massive open-pit mine would destroy huge swaths of the Superior National Forest and significantly increase annual CO2 emissions in Minnesota at the worst possible time,\u201d the group said.\n\nPolyMet contends it can operate the proposed mine near Hoyt Lakes and Babbitt without harming the environment while creating hundreds of badly needed jobs on Minnesota\u2019s Iron Range.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to building and operating a modern mine and developing the materials that sustain and enhance our modern world,\u201d PolyMet President and CEO Jon Cherry said in a news release. \u201cResponsibly developing these strategic minerals in compliance with these permits while protecting Minnesota\u2019s natural resources is our top priority as we move forward.\u201d\n\nPaula Maccabee, an attorney for environmental group WaterLegacy, said environmentalists will likely appeal if permits are granted, or they could request that the DNR reconsider its decision.\n\nThe agency issued a permit to mine, six water appropriation permits, two dam safety permits, a public waters work permit and an endangered species takings permit for the project. The permit to mine includes a financial assurance plan \u2014 designed to provide enough money so the DNR can reclaim and close the mine and plant site in case PolyMet does not \u2014 and a wetland replacement plan. The project still requires water and air quality permits from the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency and a wetlands permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.\n\nLandwehr said the DNR is \u201cconfident that the project can be built, operated, and reclaimed in compliance with Minnesota\u2019s rigorous environmental standards.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, there will be an environmental impact,\u201d Landwehr told reporters. \u201cOur job is to ensure those environmental impacts are within state standards, and whenever required, they are mitigated.\u201d\n\nMaccabee and other environmentalists questioned why the DNR did not conduct a contested case hearing for an independent review before issuing the permits. But Landwehr said the project did not meet the standards under state law for such a trial-like hearing.\n\n\u201cThese permits should be reviewed by an independent administrative law judge to establish the facts before permit decisions are made,\u201d Kathryn Hoffman, chief executive of the Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy, said in a statement, noting that such hearings are routine for pipelines and power plants. \u201cIt is special treatment for PolyMet to skip this vital step for the first copper-nickel mine to apply for permits in Minnesota.\u201d\n\nMinnesota Republican legislative leaders hailed the DNR\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cThis new mine will create many good-paying jobs in Northeastern Minnesota and provide a real boost to the state\u2019s economy,\u201d House Speaker Kurt Daudt, a Republican from Crown, said in a statement.\n\nThe project would cost an estimated $945 million to construct.

Ian Buruma, editor of The New York Review of Books was fired after publishing an essay by Ghomeshi in September. (Frank Gunn/The Canadian Press via AP) MANDATORY CREDIT\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 For literary magazines over the past year, much of the news has been in the masthead.\n\nEditor Lorin Stein of the Paris Review left amid allegations of sexual harassment and editor Ian Buruma of The New York Review of Books was fired after publishing an essay by Jian Ghomeshi, the Canadian broadcaster and musician who faced multiple allegations of harassment and assault. Editor James Marcus of Harper\u2019 s departed after objecting to the magazine\u2019s publication of a Katie Roiphe essay which criticized #MeToo as intolerant of dissent. An online list which compiled allegations against various \u201cmedia men\u201d led to a lawsuit by The Rumpus founder and former editor-in-chief Stephen Elliott, who has alleged the list falsely implies he is a rapist.\n\nThe stories of harassment didn\u2019t just change titles, but bared a longstanding contradiction within the New York literary world \u2014 between the progressive worldview of some of the leading publications and the private behavior of those in charge.\n\n\u201cThe internal culture of many a progressive magazine is surprisingly retrograde \u2014 like an old-fashioned company town with fancier coffee machines,\u201d Marcus said. \u201cThe contradiction can be glaring. Yet I do think that #MeToo has seeped into these establishments, in ways that are easily recognizable and less so. You have Emily Nemens (who replaced Stein) at the helm of the Paris Review, of course, and Ian Buruma\u2019s abrupt dismissal from the New York Review of Books. But there are more subtle effects, too. When it comes to shutting down female colleagues in meetings, or batting away pitches from female writers, more men are likely to think twice \u2014 not exactly revolutionary, but a step in the right direction.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe culture of the publishing industry specifically is to a great extent a reflection of American culture more generally,\u201d says The Rumpus\u2019 current owner and editor-in-chief, Marisa Siegel, who took over in January 2017, before the focus on sexual harassment became a cultural focus. \u201cWhile firing men who are guilty of workplace harassment and assault is important, in that no workplace should tolerate that kind of behavior, I\u2019m not certain a handful of firings can change workplace culture.\u201d\n\nThe #MeToo movement has been an ongoing reminder \u2014 and for some a revelation \u2014 that the most well-read people aren\u2019t necessarily the most civilized. Leon Wieseltier, for decades the literary editor for The New Republic and most recently a contributing editor for The Atlantic, has translated the works of Israeli poet Yehuda Amichai and edited a volume of essays by the critic Lionel Trilling. Meanwhile, colleagues told stories of Wieseltier kissing them without permission, making crude sexual remarks and encouraging them to wear short dresses. He was dropped last year by The Atlantic and a planned journal he was to launch through the non-profit Emerson Collective was cancelled (Wieseltier has apologized and vowed \u201cnot (to) waste this reckoning.\u201d).\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s this ideal that if you\u2019re well read, you\u2019re going to be more empathetic and moral,\u201d said Amy King, a board member of VIDA, a nonprofit organization which tracks gender parity at literary magazines. \u201cIt\u2019s disturbing to find out your heroes are corruptible.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know any women who have worked with members of the literary elite who would be surprised by the fact that some of most learned, politically engaged powerful men \u2014 and some women \u2014 behave in infantile ways when it comes to power and sex,\u201d said the author and journalist Rebecca Traister, who writes extensively about #MeToo in her new book, \u201cGood and Mad.\u201d\n\nPart of the debate about #MeToo has been how, or if, to present the other side. Some magazines have devoted extensive space to those accused of harassment. Harper\u2019s ran a maudlin, 7,000-word essay by John Hockenberry, the longtime public radio host who was fired last year. The New York Review of Books published a 3,400-word essay in September by Ghomeshi, who described himself as a victim of \u201cmass shaming.\u201d Traister calls the essays examples of how the \u201cwhole conversation shifts in gravity\u201d away from stories of those who spoke out about being harassed to those who once held power.\n\nSoon after the essay came out, Buruma defended his decision in a telephone interview with Slate\u2019s Isaac Chotiner, saying he was \u201cnot judging him (Ghomeshi) for the exact rights and wrongs of what he did in the past.\u201d Buruma was fired, with Review publisher Rea Hederman chastising him for leaving female staffers out of the editorial process. But Buruma was defended by such Review contributors as Joyce Carol Oates, Lorrie Moore, Ian McEwan, all of whom signed a letter which called his ouster an \u201cabandonment of the central mission of the Review, which is the free exploration of ideas.\u201d\n\nThe male culture of literary magazines had been documented well before the rise of #MeToo. In 2011, VIDA began publishing an annual tally of the percentage of women writers and reviewers at some of the top publications. The results were as stark as King and others had imagined: At the Atlantic, three times more space was given to men than to women. The ratio was more than 5-1 at The New Republic and at The New York Review of Books.\n\n\u201cFor a long time there was a suspicion among female writers that we were outnumbered,\u201d King says. \u201cWe set out to confirm those suspicions.\u201d\n\nWhile several publications have since narrowed or closed the gender gap, others have seen little change. At The Threepenny Review , VIDA found that men were given two-thirds of the space in 2017, a percentage roughly the same as VIDA\u2019s initial counts. Threepenny founder Wendy Lesser questioned the value of the VIDA reports.\n\n\u201cI do not think it\u2019s useful to classify writers \u2014 or, for that matter, editors \u2014 according to gender,\u201d she wrote in a recent email. \u201cAs an editor, I try to view each Threepenny Review writer as an individual, with something special to say that only that writer can say in that way. It doesn\u2019t make sense to try to replace those individual viewpoints with more \u2018representative\u2019 or \u2018fairly distributed\u2019 people, because there is no such thing in literature.\u201d", "1 of 2 In this Jan. 29, 2018 photo, Vermont State Rep.

The time in prison was \u201chell\u201d but transformed his life and inspired him to help other inmates and work for criminal justice reform, he said.\n\nWillhoit\u2019s prison term, however, isn\u2019t enough for his hometown paper, the Caledonian Record, who recently panned his run as \u201cpatently absurd.\u201d The Caledonian Record wrote that he is soft on crime and never paid back his victims.\n\n\u201cWhen Willhoit decided to steal another person\u2019s life-savings, later opting not to pay any of it back, we feel strongly that he disqualified himself from serving as our state\u2019s highest ranking law-enforcement officer,\u201d the Caledonian Record wrote in an Oct. 3 editorial.\n\nWillhoit responded in a letter to the editor. He said that he served his time and tried to get probation \u201cto pay back what had been lost\u201d but the victims said no, and wanted him \u201cto rot.\u201d At that time his life changed and he started to help others, by teaching inmates to read and tutoring inmates seeking the equivalent of a high school diploma, he wrote.\n\n\u201cI am far from a perfect person, but as your Attorney General I will fight for you, all of you, just as fervently as I stand for and protect those I have been called to serve as a legislator, defender, and foster parent,\u201d he wrote.\n\nSen. Joe Benning, a fellow Republican legislator and lawyer in Caledonia County, said Willhoit is competent, but \u201chas an uphill battle in facing off against an entrenched incumbent.\u201d\n\nThat incumbent is Attorney General TJ Donovan, a Democrat, and former county prosecutor, who is seeking his second term. Donovan learned a lesson when he was a teen that he said he has not forgotten as he works for reforms to the criminal justice system.\n\nHe got into a fight and was charged with assault, the weekly newspaper Seven Days reported. He was put on probation and the charge was later expunged.\n\n\u201cI would say it was a wake-up call, but I think the lesson is people make mistakes, people necessarily shouldn\u2019t be defined by one of the worst moments and that I believe in second chances,\u201d he said Wednesday.\n\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019ve worked hard to reform our criminal justice system to create a public health system that deals with the issues of addiction, that deals with the issues of mental illness. That\u2019s why I advocated for expanding our expungement law because a job is the best form of public safety and I believe in expungement. And that\u2019s why I worked and advocated to reform our public bail system because being poor is not a crime.\u201d\n\nUnlike the other two candidates, perennial candidate Rosemarie Jackowski, 81, of the Liberty Union party said she\u2019s proud of her brush with the law. She was arrested during a peaceful Iraq war protest in 2003 in Bennington and charged with disorderly conduct.\n\n\u201cIt makes me smile that all three candidates have an interesting legal history,\u201d she said.", "This photo provided by the Okmulgee County Jail in Okmulgee, Okla., shows Amy Leann Hall, who is in custody after three teenagers were shot, one fatally in a shooting reported Thursday morning, Nov. 1, 2018, in the Nuyaka, Okla., area.

(AP) \u2014 An 18-year-old man was killed and two teenage girls were injured in a shooting Thursday in rural eastern Oklahoma, and a woman believed to be the mother of at least one of the victims is in custody, a sheriff said.\n\nThe shooting was reported around 6:30 a.m. at a home in the Nuyaka area, about 35 miles (55 kilometers) southwest of Tulsa. Okmulgee County Sheriff Eddy Rice said at a news conference that the young man was found dead at the scene, one of the girls was in critical condition and the other was stable.\n\nRice said Amy Leann Hall, 38, who is believed to be the biological mother of at least one of the teens, is in custody.

We\u2019re still investigating this,\u201d Rice said.\n\nPolice have visited the household multiple times, typically for domestic issues, he said. Hall had previously pleaded guilty to a minor larceny charge in 2014.\n\nAccording to online court records, Hall was in the middle of a two-year custody battle with the father of her children. Last month Hall alleged the man, who had been granted partial custody, sent \u201cthreatening and inappropriate\u201d text messages to their son. She also alleged he would show up at their home \u201cat all hours of the night.\u201d\n\nIn June 2016, the man claimed that Hall was mentally unstable and was psychologically abusive.\n\nThe sheriff said authorities don\u2019t believe anyone else was involved in the shootings and that there is no threat to the community.\n\nRice told the Tulsa World that Hall left the home after the shooting and was briefly pursued by officers before being taken into custody.\n\nBeggs High School Superintendent Brian Terry told The Associated Press that the victims were siblings and students at the school. Terry said the student who died was a senior, while the critically wounded student is a junior. The third victim is a freshman, he said.", "MITCHELL, S.D.

John Kasich\u2019s plan to create new regulations on thousands of farms in a bid to reduce fertilizer and manure feeding Lake Erie\u2019s sometimes toxic algae blooms.\n\nThe decision by the Ohio Soil and Water Conservation Commission came amid concerns over how the regulations would be put in place and amid pushback from the agriculture industry.\n\nThe delay is a blow to Kasich\u2019s attempt at taking a more aggressive approach against the persistent algae blooms before he leaves office at year\u2019s end.\n\nBy a 4-3 vote, the commission opted to wait on approving the plan until at least February to allow more time to establish rules overseeing the changes.\n\n\u201cClearly it is going to take other avenues and other measures to achieve the protections we need, and we urge everyone who cares about water quality in Ohio and in the Great Lakes to come together to save the lake before it\u2019s too late,\u201d said Kasich spokesman Jon Keeling.\n\nKasich issued an executive order in July that called for issuing \u201cdistressed watershed\u201d designations for eight creeks and rivers in northwestern Ohio.

The move announced by the players\u2019 union on Thursday ends the deal on Oct. 31, 2019, or the day after the postseason finale.\n\nThe move allows the sides to negotiate a new deal that would go into effect for the 2020 season during an Olympic year.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to our upcoming discussions and negotiating a new agreement with the league,\u201d the union said in a statement.\n\nThe league has seen growth in many areas since the current CBA went into effect in 2014. Television ratings this season were the league\u2019s best in four years. The WNBA started live streaming games on Twitter and partnered with one-day daily fantasy sites. Players appeared in a video game for the first time.\n\nThat hasn\u2019t translated into the league and its owners making money. According to the WNBA, it\u2019s lost a significant amount over the last 22 years, including $12 million last season.\n\n\u201cOn average (we\u2019ve lost) over $10 million every year we\u2019ve operated,\u201d NBA commissioner Adam Silver told the AP in a phone interview this week.\n\nThe top base salary for a veteran WNBA player is $115,500. A few players were able to make over $150,000 adding performance bonuses, team marketing deals and stay-at-home bonuses to their base pay.\n\nTravel woes and player fatigue came to the forefront last season when the schedule was crammed into 13 weeks because of the FIBA Women\u2019s World Cup.

In 2013, the league approved New York taking a charter flight to Indiana for a game when all other flight options were exhausted. For the Aces, no charter flight was available during its travel woes, according to the team.

It\u2019s another Democratic year in a solid Democratic state \u2014 the accidental election of a Republican governor in 2014 will be consigned to the ash heap of history.\n\nBut even though the politics will be put to bed, policy in our debased state remains up for grabs.\n\nDemocrat J.B. Pritzker \u2014 governor in waiting \u2014 is promising dramatic tax and spending increases. If his campaign rhetoric is to be believed, he\u2019s promised new programs that will, if estimates are to be believed, cost anywhere from $10 billion-plus to as much as $18 billion.\n\nThat\u2019s a load. It will be interesting to watch how Pritzker and legislative Democrats, who will retain their dramatic majorities in the General Assembly, implement those promised changes.\n\nBut in terms of the issues facing Illinois, that mammoth spending plan is chump change.\n\nPeople might have forgotten amid the usual rhetoric that Illinois faces another huge problem that few people in charge have wanted to talk about during this election year.\n\nWhat is Illinois to do about its dramatically underfunded public pension system?\n\nSpringfield\u2019s State Journal-Register recently called the $130 billion underfunding problem \u201cIllinois\u2019 most intractable problem that also happens to be its most expensive.\u201d\n\nIt didn\u2019t have to be that way, of course. Illinois\u2019 pension woes can be traced directly to past legislators and governors who promised too much and then funded too little.\n\nThere have been all kinds of proposals about what to do to address the issue, including one that property owners will hate. How about a statewide property tax, the revenues from which will go straight to the pensions? The Chicago Federal Reserve recently proposed a 1 percent statewide residential property tax \u2014 that\u2019s an additional $2,500 on a house worth $250,000 \u2014 for many years to come.\n\nRauner and the Democratic Legislature have tiptoed around the problem.\n\nBorrowing an idea initially proposed by Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigan, Rauner has proposed slowly shifting the state\u2019s responsibility for paying teacher pensions to local school districts. That might save the state money, but pushing the cost on local property owners wouldn\u2019t address the core problem.\n\nRauner also has embraced a complicated plan promoted by Democratic Senate President John Cullerton to persuade some state employees to trade some benefits now for future benefits. That, too, has the look of a non-starter.\n\nPritzker has a more ambitious plan, but it\u2019s one that sorely conflicts with his goal of dramatically increasing state spending on social programs. He wants to make outsized payments to the pensions now to cut into the underfunding problem.\n\nBut state pension payments, along with Medicaid, already are consuming such a large part of the state budget, it\u2019s hard to imagine where Pritzker thinks he\u2019s going to get the money.\n\nThat\u2019s where his tax plans come into play. But he\u2019s repeatedly refused to discuss the details of what he has in mind. So that\u2019s where Illinois stands on pensions \u2014 essentially, nowhere.\n\nThe biggest problem Illinois has ever faced is a non-issue until Nov. 6, Election Day.\n\nIt will resume its status as Public Enemy No. 1 the day after, too late for voters to factor it into their decision on who will lead the state for the next four years.\n\n___\n\nOct. 26, 2018\n\n(Arlington Heights) Daily Herald\n\nDon\u2019t fall for political deception in non-binding referendums\n\nDaily Herald editors conducted an exhaustive review of binding referendums throughout the suburbs as part of our presentation of endorsements for candidates and issues on the Nov. 6 ballot, but there were several questions we ignored altogether. You should ignore them, too.\n\nThese are nonbinding referendums added to regional and county ballots under the pretense of seeking voter advice about some issue. In reality, the last thing these referendums want is advice.\n\nInstead, most are perverse attempts to either produce political talking points for the future or get selected voters to the polls by sounding false alarms.\n\nOne of the most prominent of these is a question on many local ballots regarding property taxes.\n\nIn Kane and DuPage counties, the question asks voters whether their officials should \u201coppose the Illinois General Assembly instituting a 1 percent annual real estate tax on the fair market value of your property to pay state unfunded liabilities.\u201d In Lake County, the phrasing asks whether lawmakers should \u201camend the State Constitution to ban the creation of a new statewide property tax?\u201d No such question is on the countywide ballot in Cook, but numerous townships have added versions of it to theirs.\n\nVoters should be aware that there is no serious proposal to create \u201ca new statewide property tax,\u201d and certainly nothing as specific as a 1 percent tax increase.\n\nSome economists from the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago made news last spring with a similar proposal, but no one took the idea seriously, and there is no move for such a thing. From a political perspective, the very notion borders on the ridiculous.\n\nBut politicians who want to portray themselves as tax fighters know they can buff their image and get one-issue voters to the polls if they rile them up with ersatz threats of a looming new tax. Hence, a vaguely, in some cases confusingly worded question filled with buzzwords but no teeth.\n\nCook County ballots are playing a different game.\n\nThey include three questions that exist solely to make political points. One relates to penalties and certification related to gun sales. Two are targeted specifically to suburban communities -- asking voters whether \u201cyour municipality\u201d should match the minimum wage and earned sick time provisions established by the county -- an apparent effort solely to embarrass the numerous suburban communities whose leaders opted out of those measures.\n\nIn other locales, you may see issues related to climate change, a statewide tax on vehicle miles traveled, restoring or rejecting the Cook County sweetened beverage tax, homeowner tax exemptions, government consolidation and more.\n\nSome of these measures may deserve public debate. Almost none of them really aim to solicit your advice and absolutely none of them will have any material impact on what state or local government does. They were not worthy of consideration for our endorsement and they certainly are not worthy of your thought and time.\n\nSuburban ballots include enough proposals requiring serious scrutiny on issues for fire departments, schools, communities and libraries. Don\u2019t surrender an instant of your study time on these issues to fall prey to some political interest\u2019s cynical gimmick to lure you into advancing its mission.\n\n___\n\nOct. 22, 2018\n\n(Decatur) Herald & Review\n\nRemember, we\u2019re more than politics\n\nThey have returned - the ominous voiceover people, filling our TVs and social media feeds with how candidate A can\u2019t be trusted or candidate B is everything wrong with humanity, didn\u2019t you know that?\n\nThey are part of the tapestry of election frenzy that\u2019s in the backstretch before November.

(AP) \u2014 Alabama\u2019s Tua Tagovailoa has been one of the nation\u2019s most electric quarterbacks, flinging one touchdown pass after another without a single interception.\n\nGrant Delpit and the LSU defensive backs welcome the challenge.\n\n\u201cI think we match up well with them,\u201d the Tigers safety said. \u201cWe have the best DBs out there.\u201d\n\nIn a bruising SEC West rivalry known more for stout defense and running games, the most delectable matchup for Saturday night\u2019s game in Baton Rouge is Tua vs. the Tigers.\n\nTagovailoa has led the top-ranked Crimson Tide (8-0, 5-0 Southeastern Conference, No. 1 CFP) on an offensive onslaught starting in January with the second half of the national championship game and only building from there. No. 4 LSU (7-1, 4-1, No. 3) has bedeviled opposing quarterbacks with a nation\u2019s best 14 interceptions and ranks fifth in pass defense efficiency.\n\n\u201cThis is probably going to be the best front seven that we\u2019re going to face to date as well as the best secondary to date,\u201d Tagovailoa said.\n\nAnd LSU hasn\u2019t faced a hotter quarterback. Tagovailoa is the nation\u2019s highest rated passer while directing the top scoring offense. Most notably, facing such a thieving defense, he has thrown for 25 touchdowns without a pick.\n\nTagovailoa has passed for 2,066 yards, including a number of deep balls to Jerry Jeudy and a talented group of receivers. This might just present his first chance to play an entire game since high school in Hawaii.\n\nAlabama has built up such big leads in every game that he has only taken 57.9 percent of the Tide\u2019s snaps and has been a spectator by the fourth quarter each time.\n\nTagovailoa also hasn\u2019t faced a secondary like LSU\u2019s. Delpit leads the SEC with five interceptions and Greedy Williams is one of the league\u2019s top cornerbacks. Both are among the 14 semifinalist for the Jim Thorpe Award given to the nation\u2019s top defensive back.\n\nThe Tide passing game typically hasn\u2019t been LSU\u2019s biggest concern .\n\nAn Alabama quarterback has only topped 200 passing yards against LSU once in the last eight meetings, and Blake Sims needed overtime to get to 209 yards in 2014.\n\nThis Tide team is different. LSU coach Ed Orgeron says that boils down to Tagovailoa opening up an offense that\u2019s always been loaded with tailback talent under Nick Saban.\n\n\u201cNow, you\u2019ve got to add a great quarterback that can have any run-pass option at any time,\u201d Orgeron said. \u201cIt makes it very difficult to defend.\u201d\n\nTagovailoa also has one of the nation\u2019s best deep threats in Jeudy, who\u2019s averaging 25.1 yards on 31 catches with 10 touchdowns.\n\nThe Tigers already have given No. 6 Georgia\u2019s Jake Fromm fits in a 36-16 upset. The normally efficient Fromm completed just 16 of 34 passes and threw two of his four interceptions in that game.\n\n\u201cI remember when Georgia came here they were talking about how Tiger Stadium wouldn\u2019t affect the quarterback,\u201d Delpit said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the best stadium in the country, so our fans are going to affect him. It\u2019s all about affecting the quarterback.\n\n\u201cSo, DBs, we\u2019re going to match up, so there\u2019s not going to be many open receivers. So, that\u2019s going to be definitely the biggest matchup of the game, the secondary vs. Tua. He\u2019s a great quarterback. He makes all the right decisions, but he\u2019s about to play us, so he might make a little mistake.\u201d\n\nTagovailoa just hasn\u2019t made many so far, and he also hasn\u2019t had to bounce back often within a game.\n\nBut an interception and sack didn\u2019t faze him in the national championship game against Georgia, when he came off the bench to lead a second-half comeback and delivered the winning touchdown pass in overtime.\n\nThis will be the closest thing to that pressurized environment that Tagovailoa has faced since then. Only now he has eight starts under his belt.\n\n\u201cNo stage is too big for him,\u201d Alabama center Ross Pierschbacher said. \u201cFor him to come in as a true freshman in the national championship game last year just kind of proved that situation. That was as hard of a thing to step into as you could probably do and for him to go out and execute like the way that he did, we have complete confidence in him.\u201d\n\nLSU\u2019s DBs aren\u2019t lacking confidence, either.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Brett Martel in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "ST.

(AP Photo/Fernando Llano)\n\nCARAYACA, Venezuela (AP) \u2014 Images of a tiny red bird that barely fills the palm of one\u2019s hand appear everywhere in Venezuela \u2014 printed on money, labels of craft beer bottles and the cover of children\u2019s school books.\n\nBut the finch-like red siskin is vanishing from the wild at an alarming rate, falling prey to a century of shrinking forests and poachers cashing in on their brilliant red feathers, prized around the world by breeders of exotic birds.\n\nThat threat has brought together an international team including scientists from the Smithsonian Institution in Washington and poor coffee farmers in Venezuela\u2019s remote mountains, all set on rescuing it from extinction. The plan is to entice farmers to plant organic coffee groves with layers of thick branches that are inviting to the endangered, perching songbird, which has lost a lot of its habitat.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have many years left, unless we do something right now,\u201d said Miguel Arvelo, a veterinarian for the Caracas-based nonprofit Provita, one of the groups spearheading the effort.\n\nThe \u201cCardenalito,\u201d or \u201cLittle Cardinal\u201d as it is affectionately called, holds a special place in Venezuelan culture, the poster child of some 1,400 bird species \u2014 from the Amazon to the Andes \u2014 that live in one of the world\u2019s most biodiverse landscapes.\n\nOnce flourishing in the millions, as few as 300 remain in the wild in Venezuela, although scientists say it\u2019s difficult to estimate their numbers in the politically turbulent and dangerous country.\n\nThe Red Siskin Initiative launched about three years ago on a shoestring budget of less than $100,000 from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and private groups in the U.S. and Venezuela.\n\nPlanting organic groves with thick branches reverses a trend among farmers who boost bean production by thinning coffee groves for more sunlight, or cut them down altogether to plant vegetables that turn a quicker profit.\n\nFarmers who meet the project\u2019s strict standards will win the right to market their beans with \u201cBird Friendly\u201d labels and take advantage of a loophole in Venezuelan law to set prices for premium products, sometimes five times higher than price caps set by the socialist government. Eventually they hope to export the coffee.\n\nIn parallel, a red siskin breeding center is being built at a private zoo in Venezuela where 200 birds are expected to be hatched next year, adding to the 25 caged at the Smithsonian Institution, forming a type of Noah\u2019s Ark to ensure that the iconic species does not disappear. Red siskins from the center will be introduced into the coffee groves.\n\nWhile still in its early stages, backers say coffee initiative is already showing positive results. Some 40 farmers in the rugged, coastal mountains of Carayaca, northwest of the capital Caracas, have already stopped cutting down trees \u2014 an important first step to creating a robust habitat.\n\nThe tiny bird is prized for its fiery red plumage and jet-black hood on males, coveted by breeders who cross them with less colorful canaries to produce offspring of orange or red spots.\n\nProtection under Venezuelan law dating back to the 1940s hasn\u2019t stopped poachers from catching it to sell on the international black market. Online they fetch a high price and demand remains strong in Eastern Europe and Asia, scientists say.\n\nAdding to challenges, poor Venezuelan families often capture and sell the threatened bird to illegal traffickers. The profit can feed their children for months, said biologist Jhonathan Miranda, a Provita researcher.\n\nMichael Braun, co-founder of the Red Siskin Initiative and a research scientist at Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of Natural History, said Venezuela\u2019s deepening crisis has also taken a toll.\n\nThe oil-rich nation was for decades a coveted destination for naturalists and amateur birders. But recently a field researcher in a remote mountain range was robbed of his binoculars and then shot at by two young men on a motorcycle, Braun said. At least one key member of their research team joined a growing exodus of Venezuelans fleeing the country.\n\n\u201cEvery time I tell somebody we have an endangered bird project in Venezuela, they say, \u2018Oh, Venezuela? Good luck,\u2019\u201d Braun said. \u201cIt\u2019s a challenge.\u201d\n\nThe red siskin\u2019s primary range is the Caribbean coastal region of Venezuela, and some have been found in neighboring areas of Colombia and Guyana.\n\nScientists carefully conceal the bird\u2019s location to protect them from poachers, but they allowed The Associated Press to photograph a small flock at a secret location in their natural habitat.\n\nCatching sight of them required arriving before dawn, hiding motionless and silently in tall grass thick with mosquitoes under pouring rain. Then, the sun broke through and they swooped in \u2014 a dozen or more \u2014 landing one by one on tangled tree branches overhead, preening and loudly singing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen so many together,\u201d said an emotion-filled Miranda. \u201cIt gives us hope.\u201d\n\nIn Carayaca, Simon Then, a 53-year-old blue-eyed, blond farmer \u2014 descended from early German settlers \u2014 walks through his family\u2019s coffee grove surrounded by dozens of leafy, 5-foot-high shrubs nestled on a steep slope.

Solis, File)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Against the backdrop of next week\u2019s midterm elections, the U.S. job market is the healthiest it\u2019s been in at least two decades. And with another strong hiring report expected Friday, some barometers of the job market suggest that it has room to strengthen further.\n\nBusinesses, hungry for workers, are advertising a record number of openings. Companies in October added the most jobs in eight months, a private survey found. Pay has been picking up.\n\nIn the past year or so, as unemployment has dwindled to a now-49-year low, economists had been predicting that hiring would slow as the pool of jobless workers shrank. Yet so far that hasn\u2019t happened. In fact, job growth has actually accelerated this year from 2017.\n\nAnd though some industries have complained of a lack of qualified applicants, other signs point to a pool of readily available workers, including the number of part-time workers who would prefer full-time jobs.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem to me that we\u2019re anywhere near the point where, oh my God, we can\u2019t find people,\u201d said Joseph LaVorgna, chief economist for the Americas at Natixis, an asset management company.\n\nSo far in 2018, employers have added a robust average of 208,000 jobs a month. That\u2019s stronger than last year\u2019s average of 182,000, though not quite at the sizzling pace of roughly 250,000 in 2015. Combined, all that hiring has been enough to cut the jobless rate to 3.7 percent, the lowest level since 1969.\n\nEconomists have forecast that the October jobs report being released Friday \u2014 the final snapshot of the labor market before Election Day \u2014 will show that a solid 190,000 jobs were added and that unemployment was unchanged. Polls have suggested that while Americans generally approve of the economy\u2019s performance, that sentiment hasn\u2019t necessarily broadened voter support for President Donald Trump or Republican congressional candidates.\n\nAt some point, job growth will moderate and likely even reverse itself, particularly if the economy \u2014 now in its 10th year of expansion, the second-longest such stretch on record \u2014 tips into recession. LaVorgna thinks the cause will most likely be the Federal Reserve\u2019s ongoing interest rate hikes, which could squelch growth by making borrowing increasingly expensive for businesses and households. Or the Trump administration\u2019s trade wars could weaken the economy enough to depress hiring.\n\nContrary to the concerns of some analysts, LaVorgna doesn\u2019t envision an economy-wide shortage of available hires anytime soon.\n\n\u201cThere is no evidence that the economy ever runs out of workers during an economic expansion,\u201d he said.\n\nMore employers are stepping up their pay increases in order to attract and retain workers. Retailers like Amazon, Walmart and Target have been steadily raising their entry-level wages, with Amazon paying $15 an hour starting on Thursday.\n\nA pickup in average pay suggests that companies have to work harder to fill their open positions. Higher pay can also draw people who aren\u2019t working and hadn\u2019t been seeking a job to begin looking.\n\nAmericans who are neither working nor looking for work aren\u2019t counted as unemployed. For some of them, the costs of child care and commuting to a job can outweigh the financial benefit of a job. Yet as pay rises, that calculation can change in favor of seeking work.\n\nSalaries for private-sector workers rose 3.1 percent in the July-September quarter compared with a year ago, the government said Wednesday. That was the strongest increase in a decade.\n\nStill, by most measures, average wage increases remain below the levels they reached the last time unemployment was this low. That may indicate that employers aren\u2019t quite panicking about finding enough people to hire.\n\nPay increases are \u201cgrinding higher,\u201d said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. \u201cBut they aren\u2019t exploding.\u201d\n\nOne reason may be there are some ways in which employers can find workers without offering larger raises. Research by economists at the job listing site Indeed has found that that the proportion of Americans working part time who would prefer full-time jobs remains elevated. About 2.9 percent of all workers are in that category, compared with 2.6 percent before the recession and 2.2 percent in 2000, when the unemployment rate was nearly as low as it is now.\n\nMartha Gimbel, research director for Indeed, says that companies can offer more hours to their part-time workers without necessarily having to raise pay. That\u2019s easier than having to dangle sizable raises to recruit workers from other companies. The number of part-time workers who would prefer more hours has been dropping \u2014 a sign that companies are already taking that step.\n\n\u201cI do think the job market has room to improve,\u201d Gimbel said.\n\nThe proportion of Americans in their prime working years \u2014 25 through 54 \u2014 who have jobs remains below its pre-recession level, though it\u2019s risen since 2013. If more people in this group began looking for work, employers could keep hiring despite the low unemployment rate. Such a trend would help offset the steady retirement of the baby boom generation.\n\nIn the meantime, some economists have forecast that strong hiring will continue to shrink the unemployment rate, potentially to levels not seen since the Korean War in the 1950s. Goldman Sachs forecasts that the jobless rate could decline to 3 percent by the end of 2020. Federal Reserve policymakers foresee a smaller drop by then to 3.5 percent.\n\nMark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, said that the monthly pace of hiring will ultimately have to drop by as much as half as the ranks of the unemployed fall further.\n\n\u201cThis rate of job growth is not sustainable,\u201d he said.\n\nBut, Zandi acknowledges that the strength of U.S. hiring has endured longer than he had expected.\n\n\u201cI am surprised that we have been able to maintain this rate of job growth up until this point,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know when, but it will slow.\u201d", "WAUKESHA, Wis.

Pittsburgh faces Virginia on Friday. (AP Photo/Darron Cummings, File)\n\nCHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) \u2014 The number jumped off the stat sheet: 484 rushing yards.\n\nThat\u2019s what Pittsburgh (4-4, 3-1 ACC) amassed in a wild 54-45 victory against Duke a week ago, and what No. 23 Virginia (6-2, 4-1, No. 25 CFP) will be trying to prevent when the Cavaliers host the Panthers on Friday night game.\n\nThe Cavaliers allow just 113 rushing yards per game and have held their last two opponents, Duke and North Carolina, under 70 yards.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just trying to keep teams under 3.5 yards per rush and I think we\u2019ve been really dominant with the run game recently and we\u2019re going to keep building off of it,\u201d free safety Joey Blount said. \u201cWe cannot be satisfied at this point. We need to be hungry and I think we\u2019re just trying to add onto what we have so far.\u201d\n\nThe Panthers have won the last three meetings in the series, but none of those games had the stakes up for grabs this time. Virginia sits atop the ACC\u2019s Coastal Division standings, but is tied with Pittsburgh and Virginia Tech (3-1) in the loss column with games to play against both still to come.\n\nPanthers coach Pat Narduzzi knows running the ball will be more challenging this week.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re a top 20 defense,\u201d he said. \u201cOur offense will have to be consistent with what they did last week, try to do it again, go back-to-back, back-to-back playing really good. Our defense has to make a step up, try to stop an explosive offense and a confident offense.\u201d\n\nThe Panthers got a huge lift against Duke from V\u2019Lique Carter, a freshman who started the season as a defensive back and works with the wide receivers, running backs and defensive backs. In his college debut, he carried the ball seven times for 137 yards and touchdown runs of 31 and 16 yards.\n\nCarter may not play this week as Narduzzi considers redshirting him, but the Panthers may unveil another surprise.\n\n\u201cI guarantee you, they\u2019re going to see another guy that hasn\u2019t played this week, a little special,\u201d he said. \u201cYou haven\u2019t seen his jersey out there at all. You guys got to figure out who it is, like Waldo.\u201d\n\nHere are some other things to watch when Pittsburgh visits Virginia:\n\nPROSPERITY\n\nVirginia has won three games in a row and is ranked for the first time since 2011, but the Cavaliers say it won\u2019t affect them.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s just reinforcement,\u201d linebacker Rod Snyder said of the spot in the Top 25. \u201cIt\u2019s a byproduct of the other goals that we\u2019ve set: Become bowl eligible two years in a row, beat (Virginia) Tech and play for an ACC championship. With that comes being ranked, which is pretty cool to see.\u201d\n\nGROUND AND POUND\n\nWho needs to throw the ball when you\u2019re running it as well as the Panthers? Pitt\u2019s 484-yard performance was its best since the program ran for a school-record 530 yards against Army in 1975 thanks in large part to future Hall of Famer and Heisman Trophy winner Tony Dorsett.\n\nBRYCE ON THE LOOSE\n\nVirginia quarterback Bryce Perkins has run for over 100 yards three times this season and his ability to gain ground with his feet opens things up for the rest of the offense led by RB Jordan Ellis (683 yards, 7 TDs) and WR Olamide Zaccheaus (56 catches, 690 yards, 6 TDs).\n\nRESILIENT KESSMAN\n\nPitt kicker Alex Kessman already has three field goals of 50-plus yards this season, and bounced back from a shaky performance in a loss against Notre Dame to make all three field goals \u2014 including a 54-yarder \u2014 against Duke. The Panthers \u2014 who have little margin for error \u2014 can\u2019t afford to leave points on the field.\n\n\u201cI think he will continue to get stronger,\u201d Narduzzi said. \u201cHe\u2019s got to go prove he can do it on the road. That\u2019s the challenge this week.\u201d\n\nFANS IN THE STANDS\n\nVirginia\u2019s crowds have topped 40,000 for two games in a row, and they drew a season-high 43,128 for a 12:20 p.m. start against North Carolina. That still leaves almost 20,000 empty seats, but those that come have been very engaged, and they rushed the field after Virginia beat a ranked Miami team three games ago.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "WICHITA, Kan.

Once they get there, they are obligated to appear at a federal immigration court hearing as part of their asylum cases.\n\nBy the time the immigrants reach El Calvario Methodist Church and other temporary shelters, these hearing dates have already been set. So arranging transportation out of Las Cruces for these migrants as quickly as possible is key, volunteers said.\n\nAnselmo Delgado, El Calvario church\u2019s volunteer coordinator, said he\u2019s always on the lookout for people who are extremely withdrawn because some have experienced trauma and poor treatment on their journeys.\n\nDelgado is proud of the effort El Calvario is making to help the migrants. \u201cThis has got to be the smallest church with the biggest heart in Las Cruces,\u201d he said.\n\nAn estimated 35 volunteers each week help run El Calvario\u2019s short-term shelter. They work in shifts, and different volunteers have different roles. Some prepare the food, others dole out donated clothing to migrants and others launder bedding once all the migrants have left for the week.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Las Cruces Sun-News, http://www.lcsun-news.com", "LARAMIE, Wyo.

Both men were among the Mercury Seven, the group of astronauts that piloted America\u2019s first manned spaceflights in the 1960s.\n\nNow, both astronauts are gone and Matt says the brothers want the public to get a chance at the golden helmet, which Glenn wore while setting the transcontinental speed record during 1957\u2032s \u201cProject Bullet.\u201d He gave it to Carpenter, who was a good friend, as a gift.\n\nThe helmet will be offered at auction by Dallas-based Heritage Auctions on Friday, a kind of astronautical addendum to a larger, previously announced sale involving the personal collection of another famed astronaut, Neil Armstrong.\n\nA series of auctions involving some 2,000 artifacts and mementoes owned by Armstrong, the first person to walk on the moon, begins Thursday and runs through November 2019.\n\nThe event now brings together three big names in aviation history: Glenn, Armstrong and Wright.\n\nAmong Armstrong\u2019s personal items are pieces of a wing and propeller from the 1903 Wright Flyer, the first successful heavier-than-air powered aircraft. Armstrong, who like Glenn and brothers Wilbur and Orville Wright was from Ohio, took the items with him to the moon.\n\nAs with the Glenn helmet, Armstrong\u2019s items landed in the lap of the next generation after the famed astronaut died in 2012.

An estate sale of his belongings took place in March.\n\nWhen the Carpenters discovered Armstrong\u2019s sons had organized a sale of their famous father\u2019s memorabilia, Matt Carpenter said the helmet seemed like an ideal fit. An effort to auction it earlier this year had been unsuccessful.\n\n\u201cObviously, we\u2019d love to get the most money realized for it, but also we\u2019d love to get somebody who\u2019s going to appreciate it,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a very special thing.\u201d\n\nCarpenter, now 40, and his brother Nick, who turns 39 this week, would like to use some of the proceeds to help underwrite a documentary they are producing about the Glenn-Carpenter friendship.

In fact, more than half the unrestrained fatalities the Colorado State Patrol handles occur in northern Colorado.\n\nDrivers and front-seat passengers are required by law in Colorado to wear their seat belts. However, it\u2019s a secondary enforcement law, which means police won\u2019t pull you over just because you\u2019re not buckled up.\n\nFor younger drivers and children who are passengers, the law changes some. Younger drivers can be stopped and ticketed for not wearing their seat belt. Drivers of any age can be ticketed for allowing a child not to wear theirs.\n\nStill it doesn\u2019t really matter what the law says. Wearing a seat belt is the right thing to do, and we think drivers and passengers should buckle up all the time.\n\nIn a recent Tribune story highlighting the problem, Colorado State Patrol troopers said they don\u2019t know why so many people in this part of the state choose not to wear a seat belt. However, they hear four main excuses from motorists.\n\n\u201cI was just heading up the street,\u201d \u2033It\u2019s uncomfortable,\u201d \u2033I forgot,\u201d or, popular among elderly drivers, \u201cI don\u2019t wear it; it\u2019s my choice.\u201d\n\nCol. Matt Packard, chief of the patrol, said the last excuse is mind-boggling.\n\n\u201cChoose to live,\u201d Packard said, slamming his hand down on his steering wheel. \u201cIf you can\u2019t do that for yourself, then do it for the trooper, your loved one, your kid you haven\u2019t had yet, the grandson you want to meet. Take the time to click your freakin\u2019 seat belt. That simple decision can change so much.\u201d\n\nWe agree. If you don\u2019t already routinely buckle up when you\u2019re driving, you should. It doesn\u2019t cost you anything, and it might just save your life. It\u2019s also a good idea to take responsibility for those in your car and ensure that they do the same.\n\nWeld County has long been home to too many traffic deaths. Of course, these deaths occur for a variety of reasons. And some of the folks who die in crashes are wearing their seat belts.\n\nStill, we must do something to change this grim pattern. Wearing a seat belt dramatically improves your chances of surviving a crash. We must choose life.\n\nEditorial: https://bit.ly/2JtqJ4j\n\n___\n\nGrand Junction Daily Sentinel, Oct. 30, on a wake-up call for Colorado\u2019s water situation:\n\nOne of the ironies of Colorado\u2019s water situation is the need for more storage to help the state through dry years when we can\u2019t even fill what we\u2019ve got because of the drought.\n\nThe graph on page 1 of Sunday\u2019s front page was downright bleak. Since the late 1990s, the Colorado River\u2019s total system storage has declined precipitously. As the Sentinel\u2019s Dennis Webb reported, the 10 reservoirs that the Bureau of Reclamation uses to calculate capacity are cumulatively less than half full.\n\nThe recent spate of wet weather has helped perhaps take the edge off gnawing concerns about the ongoing drought, but it\u2019s nothing more than a cosmetic effect. What we need, of course, is ample snowfall this winter and cold temperatures to preserve the snowpack until spring runoffs can restore reservoir levels.\n\nBut the National Weather Service is predicting a weak El Nino pattern, which could mean decent snowpack in the southern Colorado and a drier winter for the rest of the state. A National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration research scientist, however, told Webb he\u2019s \u201cguardedly optimistic\u201d that the wet fall weather may presage a decent winter snowpack.\n\nThe bottom line: a decent \u2014 even average \u2014 winter might replenish storage levels to put us back to where we were a year ago, which is using water fairly normally and hoping for another wet winter. But a dry winter is going to be a game-changer ... and there\u2019s not much we can do but wait and see what Mother Nature has in store.\n\nCue the snow dance music.\n\nWebb\u2019s reporting uncovered the duress Western Slope water managers faced this summer, including a first-ever call on the Yampa, where many irrigators and ditch companies lacked the infrastructure required for water rights to be administered. They\u2019ve never needed it before.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just ranchers, growers and municipal water suppliers feeling the pinch. The state\u2019s outdoor recreation economy took a hit. A lack of snow affected many resorts and the low runoff impacted rafting companies and communities dependent on boating and fishing activity.\n\nHannah Holm, coordinator of the Hutchins Water Center at Colorado Mesa University, told Webb the state\u2019s water system is pretty resilient on a year-to-year basis, but the question is how vulnerable it may be in the long term given forecasts suggesting a high likelihood of more and deeper droughts in the future, when higher temperatures are expected to exacerbate the problem.\n\nIf that\u2019s the case, the expense of undertaking more water storage projects would be a folly. You can\u2019t divert more of a dwindling resource.\n\nA tough water year should be a wake-up call that Colorado needs to be a leader on climate change. We can\u2019t keep heading into every winter with fingers crossed. State leaders need to consider every promising idea to reduce carbon emissions without trying to shut down the fossil fuel industry outright.\n\nThat would include carbon fee and dividend, higher vehicle emission standards, energy efficiency standards on new construction and encouraging national standards for methane capture related to oil and gas development.\n\nExporting liquefied natural gas for power generation to countries currently burning coal would also move the needle.\n\nEditorial: https://bit.ly/2DeNRDh\n\n___\n\n(Colorado Springs) The Gazette, Oct. 28, on keeping Vermont out of our elections:\n\nIn Colorado, our big problem isn\u2019t Russia. It is Vermont.\n\nTwice in less than a week, Vermont socialists have lectured Coloradans on how they should vote. If enough people take their advice, the result will be a long-term regional recession and financial devastation for public schools, fire departments, law enforcement and more.\n\nLeading Democrats \u2014 namely Gov. John Hickenlooper and U.S. Rep. Jared Polis \u2014 should denounce out-of-staters for trying to influence Colorado outcomes.\n\nOur first taste of Vermont meddling came a week ago Saturday, when radical environmentalist Bill McKibben encouraged a small gathering in Colorado Springs to pass Proposition 112.\n\nHe vowed to celebrate back home on election night, drinking a Fat Tire 2,000 miles from the political wreckage.\n\nProp 112 would impose 2,500-foot setbacks on oil and gas operations, forbidding production on most Colorado land. Passage means the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs and billions in revenues for public schools over time.\n\nHickenlooper and Polis each oppose Prop 112 because they live here and are sane. They should invite McKibben to leave, sending him off with a case of Bump It On Ale from Hickenlooper-founded Phantom Canyon Brewery.\n\nThings got crazier Wednesday when Vermont Democratic socialist Bernie Sanders popped into Boulder and Fort Collins to endorse Polis for governor \u2014 and Amendment 73 \u2014 after berating superrich Americans like Polis.\n\nHere\u2019s the big problem with Sen. Sanders endorsing Polis and Amendment 73: Polis opposes 73, a soak-the-middle-class-and-rich tax increase that will purportedly help classrooms, teachers and schoolchildren. The poorly written measure would allow politicians to misuse the proceeds, which they would likely do.\n\nThe top tax rate in 73 nearly matches the top rate in Vermont, which has among the country\u2019s worst economies and the eighth slowest wage growth of all 50 states. Colorado has the best economy in the country, as ranked this year by U.S. News & World Report. Bernie wants us more like Vermont.\n\nIf 73 passes, expect an abrupt halt to executives moving good companies to Colorado that provide high-wage jobs. They won\u2019t want to live here under the law\u2019s oppressive multitiered tax brackets that confiscate the rewards of success. We can expect some of our best and brightest professionals to leave Colorado for good.\n\nThe Gazette\u2019s editorial board discussed this dilemma recently with our longtime friend Hickenlooper, a likely 2020 presidential candidate, during a 90-minute meeting about a variety of topics.\n\n\u201cI have a lot of very highly compensated people whose taxes would go up dramatically,\u201d Hickenlooper told us, regarding 73. \u201cThe ones I know wouldn\u2019t leave Colorado. They\u2019ll bitch, and they\u2019d put more money into political campaigns for sure, but they wouldn\u2019t leave.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut would they have come here?\u201d a board member asked. \u201cWho won\u2019t come here?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s fair,\u201d Hickenlooper responded.\n\nThe governor would not have written Amendment 73 as is, and said he could publicly support the measure only if \u201cit was a bit more modest.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you are against it?\u201d The Gazette asked.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to figure out whether I am going to come out against it,\u201d the governor said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to come out against it when you have made your career lobbying to pay teachers more.\u201d\n\nWe discussed with Hickenlooper our shared concern about low wages for teachers, but explained Amendment 73 is so poorly written it will starve fire districts, police departments, and all assortment of local tax-funded services. It does so by carelessly tweaking property tax assessments, as explained by county assessors, police chiefs, mayors and more.\n\n\u201cIf you find out that\u2019s true, does that move the needle to where Gov. Hickenlooper says don\u2019t vote for this thing?\u201d a board member asked.\n\n\u201cProbably,\u201d the governor said.\n\nThe board encouraged Hickenlooper to contact Larimer County Assessor Steve Miller, who first discovered the math that proves Amendment 73 would choke local governments. Last we checked, the governor and assessor had not talked.\n\nFor anyone paying attention, this should be the scariest election in decades. Not because of the governor\u2019s race, or any other statewide contests for political office. None of the candidates are monsters.\n\nWe stand on the brink of an economic downfall because of multiple amateur policies proposals that could pass without the scrutiny of legislative process. They are promoted by far-left activists who won\u2019t live with the fallout. They should stay in socialist Bernie\u2019s Vermont and stay out of our elections.\n\nEditorial: https://bit.ly/2JrJlSt", "CHINCOTEAGUE, Va.

(AP Photo/Vadim Ghirda)\n\nDOHA, Qatar (AP) \u2014 Simone Biles attempted to smile but her eyes betrayed her. She was angry, paying little attention to the gold medal around her neck, the one that made history.\n\nYes, winning never gets old. It\u2019s just not why she does this.\n\nThe challenge whenever the greatest gymnast of her and any other generation steps onto the floor isn\u2019t to impress the judges so much as to meet her own impossibly high standards. The one that keeps nudging the 21-year-old to propel herself and her sport forward.\n\nAnd for two hours Thursday, for the first time in a long time, the momentum slowed. At least in the eyes of Biles, who didn\u2019t exactly sound like someone who had just become the first woman to win four world all-around championships, a feat she pulled off despite a handful of uncharacteristic errors to beat Japan\u2019s Mai Murakami and American teammate Morgan Hurd by more than 1.6 points.\n\n.@Simone_Biles now has 16 World medals, which ranks her second on the all-time world medalist list, behind Russia\u2019s Svetlana Khorkina (20). #DohaGym2018 pic.twitter.com/dTlOMUc7Jw \u2014 USA Gymnastics (@USAGym) November 1, 2018\n\nIt\u2019s a sizable margin for nearly everyone else, but not for Biles. Battling a kidney stone that she insists is manageable, she sat down her vault in the first rotation, came off the beam on her third and stepped out of bounds on floor exercise.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the gymnast that I am, to go out there and kind of bomb a meet like this,\u201d said Biles after posting an all-around score of 57.491. \u201cEven though I won, I wish it were a little bit different.\u201d\n\nOnly it wasn\u2019t, a testament to the massive difficulty Biles packs into each event. What she\u2019s doing on floor exercise is as hard as anything the men can come up with. The vault \u2014 the one that will carry her name when code of points is updated \u2014 is so tough no other woman even attempts it in competition.\n\nDoing anything else would be \u201cboring\u201d as her coach Laurent Landi put it. Yet Biles doesn\u2019t use the remarkably high start values of her routines as an excuse when she doesn\u2019t hit them. There is no grading on a curve, at least not in her head.\n\nBiles jokingly asked Landi if she needed an 18 \u2014 a score not currently possible in gymnastics \u2014 heading into her floor exercise to catch Murakami. The deficit was actually 13.308 points, totally doable. Biles briefly thought about toning down her boundary pushing set for something a bit easier just to make sure she won. The internal wavering was fleeting.\n\n\u201cI would never,\u201d Biles said.\n\nPlaying it safe simply isn\u2019t her style. While her right foot did slip into the red out of bounds during her first tumbling pass, it hardly mattered. Her score of 15.000 was more than enough to rocket past Murakami and Hurd, the 2017 world champion.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely insane that she fell twice and won,\u201d Hurd said. \u201cI have no words.\u201d\n\nNeither did Biles, at least not any positive ones.\n\nMost meets with Biles typically start the same. She drills the vault \u2014 where she is the reigning Olympic champion \u2014 and then spends the next three rotations simply padding her lead to margins that look like typos.\n\nNot this time. Attempting \u201cthe Biles\u201d \u2014 a roundoff, half-twist onto the table, front double full off typically done by men \u2014 her left arm barely touched the table, causing her to under-rotate. She landed and promptly sat down, her score of 14.533 placing her in third.\n\nKnown for getting angry with herself after mistakes, she responded with her significantly improved uneven bars set and executed her double-twisting double-somersault dismount to move slightly in front of Hurd halfway through.\n\nThen things got weird.\n\nBiles came off the beam early, hopped back up then grabbed the 4-inch piece of wood moments later when she had trouble landing a front flip, a sequence she struggled with during qualifying. It was a stunning sequence, not just to Biles but to the group that has been chasing her for the better part of decade.\n\nGiven what looked like an opening, Murakami \u2014 the first Japanese woman to win a world all-around medal in nine years \u2014 kept it real.\n\n\u201cInstead of expecting I can win, I felt like, \u2018oh, Biles can fall,\u2019\u201d Murakami said.\n\nHurd had a chance to catch her good friend but wobbled twice during her own beam set, leaving the 17-year-old in a \u201crage\u201d as she headed to floor while also leaving Biles in the lead, where she is the Olympic champion.\n\nWhile Hurd put together what U.S. high performance coordinator Tom Forster called \u201cthe best routine I\u2019ve ever seen her do\u201d it wasn\u2019t quite enough to slide past Murakami.\n\nStill, Biles stepped onto the floor facing external pressure for the first time in a long time. She came through but her emotions on the medal stand tilted more toward disappointment than joy.\n\n\u201cIt just sucks that I did so bad and I still won,\u201d said Biles, who plans to compete in all four event finals. \u201cI wish it could not happen. You have to earn it, and I\u2019m not sure I earned it tonight.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not exactly true. Her routines are so much more challenging than the rest of the world\u2019s she can afford a slip up here or there. And while she could simply employ the same skills as everyone else and probably win on execution scores alone, that wouldn\u2019t be any fun.\n\n\u201cShe has (such) great ability that she needs to push it to the limit,\u201d Landi said. \u201cAnd when it goes very well, it\u2019s amazing. When it doesn\u2019t go well, it\u2019s still good enough.\u201d\n\nEven on days she thinks it isn\u2019t.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "Deacon charged in connection with sexual assaults of boy\n\nTROY, Mich.

Their anatomies, the sort of impacts that they impact on-field. And we\u2019ve designed that helmet specifically for kids,\u201d VICIS CEO Dave Marver said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cThe helmet, for example, is tuned to lower impact velocity. Its impact performance is extremely good in the front and side locations, which is where the scientific literature suggests they are experiencing the majority of the hits. It\u2019s lighter in weight than other helmets, which reflects that kids their necks are not as well built as adults for example. This is the first helmet of its kind on the market that is truly designed and optimized for kids, whereas the other youth helmets that are out there are the adult helmets with lightweight shells.\u201d\n\nVICIS has been working toward getting into the youth market since refining the design of its helmet that is used at the professional, collegiate and high school level. The ZERO1 YOUTH is hitting the market on the same day the company announced a Series B investment of $28.5 million that includes contributions from Rodgers through his company Rx3 Ventures.\n\n\u201cWe invested in VICIS because its commitment to player safety \u2014 specifically at the youth level \u2014 is one we wanted to support,\u201d Rodgers said in a statement. \u201cWe look forward to working with VICIS as they continue to develop outstanding technologies for players at all levels.\u201d\n\nVICIS is also attempting to regulate the cost in bringing its technology to the youth helmet. Benefiting from increased volumes, this season VICIS reduced the price of its ZERO1 helmet for pros, colleges and high schools, called varsity, to $950. NCAA and high school programs that purchased the ZERO1 in volume qualified for pricing under $800 per helmet.\n\nMarver said the youth helmet will cost between $450-495, which he says is about 20 percent higher than current youth helmets on the market.\n\nVICIS isn\u2019t alone in the youth development field. Riddell has its InSite Training Tool, which provides such specific data that it is applicable at the youth, high school, college and pro levels. Basically, it tells observers if an out of the ordinary impact happens on the field.\n\nMarver said the feedback VICIS has received from the growing number of NFL players using the helmet helped contribute to the development of the youth helmet. Among the investors or advisers for the company are Rodgers, Russell Wilson, Doug Baldwin, Jerry Rice and Roger Staubach.\n\n\u201cThe NFL player investment has been very important to us as a company, It\u2019s been highly validating, and that elite players at the top of the game have seen the technology and chosen to invest in us,\u201d Marver said. \u201cIt has also I think given the confidence to other investors to also support our efforts to develop new technology in football and other sports. And it\u2019s also led to a higher level of engagement from those NFL players than one would typically get from a garden-variety advisory relationship. These players are keenly interested in the technology, in providing feedback on helmet fit, helmet comfort, helmet performance. So we benefit a lot as a company from having those very close relationships.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "In this photo taken on Wednesday, Oct. 31, 2018, police officers stand over the covered body of Greek-Australian John Macris who was shot dead outside his house in southern Athens.

A leading Yemeni rebel figure said Thursday, Nov. 1, 2018, that the Trump administration's calls for a cease-fire in his country are \"positive\" but urged action to stop airstrikes by the rebels' adversary, the U.S.-backed Saudi-led coalition. The head of the rebels' Supreme Revolutionary Committee, Mohamed Ali al-Houthi, called on those urging a cease-fire to \"to translate their desire to bring peace in Yemen into action,\" and \"to stop the bombing of Yemenis immediately.\" (AP Photo/Hani Mohammed, File)\n\nCAIRO (AP) \u2014 New U.S. calls for a cease-fire in Yemen have raised the prospect of ending a disastrous civil war that has caused the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis, but previous rounds of talks have failed and thus far neither side shows any sign of backing down.\n\nEarlier this week, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called for a \u201ccessation of hostilities\u201d and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said the truce should happen within 30 days and lead to U.N.-led talks. Their remarks mark a shift in the position of the United States, which has backed the Saudi-led coalition in its three-and-a-half-year war with Iran-aligned Houthi rebels.\n\nThe White House has come under mounting pressure to rein in Saudi Arabia since Saudi agents killed journalist Jamal Khashoggi last month in their Istanbul consulate. The slaying has also brought renewed attention to the conflict in Yemen, which has killed thousands of civilians and driven the Arab world\u2019s poorest country to the brink of famine.\n\nBut the Saudi-led coalition is unlikely to accept the current battle lines for long since they leave the Houthis in control of much of the country, including the capital, Sanaa, and the major port city of Hodeida. The two U.S. allies leading the coalition \u2014 Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates \u2014 have yet to comment on the proposal.\n\nThe rebels welcomed the calls for a truce as \u201cpositive\u201d on Thursday, while urging international action to halt the Saudi-led air campaign, which has caused the bulk of civilian casualties.\n\nMohamed Ali Al-Houthi, a senior rebel leader, said those urging a cease-fire should \u201ctranslate their desire to bring peace in Yemen into action, stop the bombing of Yemenis immediately and lift the siege on Yemen.\u201d\n\nThe coalition has meanwhile been massing troops on the outskirts of the Red Sea port of Hodeida, the entry point for 70 percent of food imports and international aid, according to Yemeni officials, including some who are inside the city. Rebels meanwhile were taking up positions along the front lines. All officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief journalists.\n\nUAE-led forces have been trying to capture the city for months, but have been halted on its outskirts by the Houthis, seasoned fighters who have held their ground despite years of heavy airstrikes.\n\nThe coalition has waged war on the Houthis since March 2015 in an effort to restore Yemen\u2019s internationally-recognized government, whose authority has been largely confined to the southern city of Aden since the rebels seized Sanaa and much of northern Yemen in 2014. The war is widely seen as a proxy battle pitting Saudi Arabia and the UAE against Iran.\n\nU.N. envoys have hosted several rounds of peace talks but have made no progress. The Saudi-backed government has demanded the Houthis withdraw from Sanaa and other areas, something the rebels have always refused to do.\n\nThe Yemeni government welcomed the cease-fire calls and said it was ready to discuss \u201cconfidence-building measures,\u201d while accusing the Houthis of \u201cintransigence\u201d in past negotiations.\n\nSultan al-Samaey, a member of the Houthis\u2019 Political Council, said the first step was to end the attacks by \u201caggressor states which are supported by the United States of America.\u201d But he said that over the longer term, the rebels would only support \u201ca peace which will preserve our independence,\u201d without elaborating.\n\nSaudi Arabia is unlikely to agree to any solution that would leave a Houthi-run entity on its southern border. The Houthis have repeatedly fired long-range missiles into Saudi Arabia, and have struck its capital, Riyadh.\n\nOrdinary Yemenis have suffered immensely as the stalemated war has dragged on, but even so, many expressed skepticism about the Trump administration\u2019s calls for a cease-fire, especially one that would leave the country divided.\n\nAyoub al-Tamimi, a pro-Houthi political activist in Sanaa, said a cease-fire would \u201cplant land mines in the future of the region.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no solution that can come from (President Donald) Trump or the Democrats, only booby traps,\u201d he said.\n\nIn areas closer to the fighting, even a temporary reprieve would be welcome. The conflict in Yemen has so far killed an estimated 10,000 people and left around two-thirds of the population of 27 million relying on aid, with more than 8 million at risk of starvation.\n\nThe International Committee for the Red Cross said Wednesday that its team in Hodeida this week found dreadful living conditions for thousands of displaced families, \u201cwho own only the clothes they wear and survive on a little rice or a thin mix of flour and water, if they find any food to eat at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe know this is out of humanitarian hands, we know this is a political issue,\u201d Avril Patterson, the ICRC\u2019s health coordinator in Yemen told the BBC on Thursday. \u201cWe need cessation of hostilities so that the country can rebuild.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Ahmed al-Haj in Sanaa, Yemen, contributed.", "The Latest: About 1,000 at Google San Francisco protest\n\nThis photo shows signage outside the offices of Google in San Francisco with the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge in the background, Wednesday, Oct. 31, 2018.

(Grace Beahm Alford/The Post And Courier via AP)\n\nCOLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) \u2014 Democrats trying to flip a U.S. House seat in South Carolina for the first time since 1986 are pouring most of their state efforts into a coastal district where Republican primary voters ousted the incumbent, instead choosing an enthusiastic backer of President Donald Trump.\n\nDemocrat Joe Cunningham, an ocean engineer and construction-industry lawyer making his first run for elective office, has raised more money than his opponent and is getting endorsements from Republican mayors and other local officials.\n\nCunningham is facing state Rep. Katie Arrington, who handed U.S. Rep. Mark Sanford his first election loss in 16 races, and then survived a serious car crash just days after the June primary.\n\nArrington found a crack by taking on Sanford\u2019s criticism of Trump\u2019s comments and tone, calling him a \u201cNever Trumper.\u201d\n\nNow Cunningham is trying to use Arrington\u2019s ardent support for Trump and his policies against her as he tries to be the first Democrat since 1980 to be elected to the U.S. House from the 1st District, which stretches from Charleston to Hilton Head Island.\n\nSigns suggest that if there\u2019s ever a House seat in South Carolina that will flip in this political climate, this could be the one. The National Republican Congressional Committee had said earlier in the fall that it had no plans to spend money on the race; now it\u2019s buying ads for Arrington with just days to go before votes are counted.\n\nNo issue better shows what Cunningham is trying to do than offshore drilling. During the primary, Arrington said she supports all of Trump\u2019s energy policies, including the possibility of drilling for oil in the Atlantic Ocean off the U.S. coast.\n\nCunningham went to Republican mayors and other leaders in coastal towns like the Isle of Palms and got their endorsement by saying he would fight any drilling off their beaches, an important issue for wealthy retirees attracted to the salt life. Census data shows 57 percent of the people living in the district moved to South Carolina from somewhere else.\n\n\u201cOur beaches, our coastline, our waterways are our pride and joy in the 1st District and I\u2019ll fight like hell to protect them,\u201d Cunningham said in a recent debate.\n\nSince her primary win, Arrington has said she\u2019s personally against offshore drilling, and is the only candidate who has the president\u2019s ear to change his mind.\n\n\u201cI will have a seat at the table,\u201d Arrington said. \u201cMr. Cunningham wrote a letter that no one will read for the next two years.\u201d\n\nThe 1st District is richer, more educated and less conservative than much of South Carolina, with a median income of $66,400, some $17,000 higher than the state\u2019s median. Its voters went 53.5 percent for Trump in 2016, several points lower than any other Republican-represented district.\n\nArrington draws a sharp line, suggesting a vote for Cunningham is a vote to turn the nation over to liberals. She calls this race a fight between good and evil, and a battle for survival.\n\nCunningham casts Arrington as a hyper-partisan street-fighter who isn\u2019t a good match for the gentle vibe of South Carolina\u2019s Lowcountry.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how you can say you\u2019re going up to Congress to serve everyone when you are classifying some people as good and other people as evil,\u201d he said.\n\nArrington, 47, talks about starting out on the graveyard shift at Denny\u2019s and working her way up to a leading role in a defense contracting business. She promises to serve no more than eight years and donate most of her congressional salary to charity.\n\nCunningham, 36, often mentions his son, born in February. He even brought him up on a question about building and expanding new roads and bridges as South Carolina\u2019s coast continues to boom. \u201cAt 6 p.m. every night I want to be home because that\u2019s when I give my son a bath,\u201d Cunningham said.\n\nSouth Carolina has not sent a new Democrat to Congress since Jim Clyburn won the 6th District in 1992, which had just been redrawn to have a majority of minority voters. The state hasn\u2019t flipped a U.S. House seat from Republican to Democrat since 1986, when Liz Patterson \u2014 the only woman the state has ever sent to Congress \u2014 won a 4th District seat left open when Republican Carroll Campbell successfully ran for governor.\n\nWith a few weeks left before the election, Arrington raised $1.4 million and spent about $1.3 million. Cunningham had raised $1.9 million and spent about $1.6 million. In comparison, Democrat Mary Geren, a Democrat running hard in South Carolina\u2019s quite conservative western 3rd District against Republican U.S. Rep. Jeff Duncan, only managed to raise $269,000 for her campaign.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics\n\n___\n\nFollow Jeffrey Collins at https://twitter.com/JSCollinsAP , read his work at https://apnews.com/search/jeffrey%20collins", "No. 25 Texas A&M (5-3, 3-2 SEC, No. 20 CFP) at Auburn (5-3, 2-3), noon EDT (ESPN)\n\nLine: Auburn by 4.\n\nSeries record: Texas A&M leads 5-3.\n\nWHAT\u2019S AT STAKE?\n\nBoth teams are trying to finish up and down seasons on a high note in November.

Grothman and Eric Trump was in Sheboygan to rally support for Wisconsin Republicans.(Gary C. Klein/The Post-Crescent via AP)\n\nMARKESAN, Wis. (AP) \u2014 Wisconsin Republican U.S. Rep. Glenn Grothman hasn\u2019t lost a race in 24 years in politics and his district has voted for a Democrat only once since the 1960s.\n\nAny other year, another Grothman victory would be nearly certain. But with the specter of a so-called blue wave of heavy Democratic turnout, Republicans aren\u2019t taking it for granted \u2014 even in a district President Donald Trump carried by 17 points in 2016.\n\nGrothman\u2019s challenger, Dan Kohl, is banking on timing being on his side.\n\n\u201cWe live in a different moment in our nation\u2019s history right now,\u201d said Kohl, 53.\n\nGrothman, 63, a staunchly conservative former attorney, has said he\u2019s in the toughest race of his career. He knows midterms are historically unkind to the party that holds the White House.\n\n\u201cYou have to look at that and worry about that,\u201d said Grothman, who served in the Wisconsin Assembly and the state Senate before being elected to Congress in 2014.\n\nAlthough timing could help Kohl, he\u2019s still campaigning in a deeply conservative area of the state. The last time a Democrat held the 6th District \u2014 which spans 10 counties north and west of Milwaukee \u2014 was in 1964. It was only for one term.\n\nMordecai Lee, a Democratic former state lawmaker and professor emeritus at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, said it would take more than a blue wave to carry Kohl to victory.\n\n\u201cIt would have to be a tsunami,\u201d he said.\n\nKohl is a nephew of former Wisconsin Sen. Herb Kohl, a philanthropist and former owner of the Milwaukee Bucks. The younger Kohl managed the Bucks\u2019 salary cap for a period during his uncle\u2019s ownership. He previously helped raise money for Hillary Clinton and former President Barack Obama but has never held elected office himself, having lost a bid for the Wisconsin Assembly 10 years ago.\n\nTwo issues Kohl is hoping will resonate with voters and bring them to his side are health care and the Republicans\u2019 tax package passed late last year. He\u2019s made both topics part of the stump speech he gives at different events, telling voters the country\u2019s wealthiest are the real beneficiaries of the new tax law, and warning that people with pre-existing conditions will lose coverage if Republicans repeal the Affordable Care Act. Grothman says he supports health insurance protections for people with pre-existing conditions.\n\n\u201cAll I can tell you is people are very concerned about the direction of our country,\u201d said Kohl, moments after speaking at a luncheon in Oshkosh with retirees from an autoworkers union.\n\nHalf of Wisconsin voters disapprove of President Donald Trump, according to a late October Marquette University Law School poll. But given the makeup of Grothman\u2019s district, he doesn\u2019t have to shy away from supporting the president.\n\nSpeaking to a group at an assisted living facility in Markesan in early October, Grothman told residents the economy is \u201cthe best in our lifetime.\u201d He said Trump doesn\u2019t get enough credit because the media doesn\u2019t like him, though he acknowledged Trump\u2019s tweets \u201ccan get a little bit immature.\u201d\n\nThe Republican tax package will be good for the economy, he tells residents, and he supports the president\u2019s idea of a border wall, saying that \u201cwhile we love immigrants,\u201d the U.S. \u201ccan\u2019t just open the border to everybody under the sun because America would be done.\u201d\n\nAntoinette Jansen, 57, vice president of the Suburban Republican Women\u2019s Club of Milwaukee, said she likes Grotham\u2019s accessibility.

But they were notably absent from the market the last few weeks, just as stock prices were tumbling on worries about global trade and rising interest rates. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The biggest buyers of stocks are coming back.\n\nMore than any other group, companies themselves are the largest purchasers of their own shares. But they were notably absent from the market the last few weeks, just as stock prices were tumbling on worries about global trade and rising interest rates.\n\nBusinesses were holding back on repurchases the last few weeks because they were in one of their \u201cblackout\u201d periods for buybacks, a regular occurrence leading up to the release of their quarterly results. Now that most companies in the S&P 500 index have given their third-quarter reports, blackouts are lifting, and analysts across Wall Street say the return of those buyers should help support the market. The S&P 500 climbed 2.7 percent over Tuesday and Wednesday, after losing nearly 10 percent in the four prior weeks.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a quiet period on buybacks, and the indication is that next month we\u2019re going to have four times as many buybacks as we had\u201d in October, said Marina Severinovsky, investment strategist at Schroders.\n\nThe dollar amounts are huge, a result of the record profits that companies have been producing thanks in part to lower tax bills. Corporations in the S&P 500 index may buy back up to $1 trillion of their own stock this year, some analysts estimate. That\u2019s enough to give every American $3,000. Last year, S&P 500 companies repurchased $519.4 billion of their stock, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.\n\nThe recent drop in stock prices leaves those shares more attractively valued, which gives even more incentive for companies looking to repurchase their own stock. Analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods say they expect Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo to be among the most aggressive big banks in repurchasing their shares, for example. Bank of America\u2019s stock trades at 9.7 times its expected earnings per share over the coming year, cheaper than the price-earnings ratio of 11.1 that it had late last month.\n\nStock repurchases help investors and companies in a couple ways. Not only do they provide support for stock prices by adding more buyers to the market, they can also goose one of the most important profit measures that shareholders judge CEOs by: the company\u2019s earnings per share.\n\nWhen a company makes $100 in profit, each investor checks how much of that their shares can lay claim to. If there are 100 shares, the company earned $1 for each. But if the company takes 50 shares off the market by buying them back, suddenly $100 in profit becomes $2 for each share.\n\nBuybacks are particularly important when companies are issuing many new shares of stock to pay their employees or to raise cash, which can dilute the ownership stakes of longtime investors. By repurchasing their shares, companies can mitigate or completely offset the effect.\n\nSo far this earnings season, nearly 20 percent of reporting S&P 500 companies have said that reduced share counts gave them a boost of at least 4 percent in earnings per share, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. If the pace maintains, it would be an acceleration from last year\u2019s 14 percent of companies.\n\nIt pays to keep track of such numbers because the stock market\u2019s big winners tend to be the companies that most reduce the number of shares they have trading in the market.\n\nAmong big companies, it can mean triple the performance. Since 2000, companies that trimmed the number of their shares outstanding by the widest margins returned an annualized 12.4 percent, according to strategists at Jefferies. Their counterparts on the opposite end of the spectrum, which increased their share count by the largest amount, returned just over 4 percent.\n\nAnd big companies tend to be more likely to reduce the number of shares they have outstanding than small companies, which tend to issue new stock to help them grow.\n\n\u201cWe do think buy backs will pick up thanks to huge hoards of cash on balance sheets and now stock prices are down,\u201d Jefferies strategist Steven DeSanctis wrote in a recent research report. \u201cIn the large caps, we do see buy backs stabilizing the overall market.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writer Marley Jay contributed to this report.", "\u2018It\u2019s okay to be white\u2019 signs appear at Tufts University\n\nMEDFORD, Mass.

The Merrillville, Indiana-based utility made the disclosure in its quarterly financial disclosure report to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nNiSource and its subsidiary were served initial grand jury subpoenas on Sept. 24, shortly after the Sept. 13 explosions and fires that killed one person, injured 25 others, and damaged or destroyed more than 130 structures across Lawrence, North Andover and Andover, the company said in its filing.\n\nThe report didn\u2019t provide further information about the nature of the investigation, and a company spokesman declined to elaborate Thursday. Lelling\u2019s office also declined to comment.\n\n\u201cWe are cooperating with all investigations and inquiries into the Lawrence event, including the criminal matter. However, we can\u2019t speak specifically to any of those inquiries,\u201d said NiSource spokesman Ken Stammen.\n\nIn a separate quarterly earnings report also released Thursday, NiSource said the explosions had cost the company about $462 million, money it expects will be \u201csubstantially recovered\u201d through insurance.\n\n\u201cWe are deeply humbled by what happened in Massachusetts, and realize that much work lies ahead of us to finish the service restoration in the Lawrence area, and to regain the trust of our customers and communities,\u201d company CEO Joe Hamrock said in a statement.\n\nThe gas explosions are also being investigated by the National Transportation Safety Board, which said in a preliminary report last month that over-pressurized natural gas lines were to blame.\n\nThat investigation has so far found the company failed to account for critical pressure sensors as it planned for upgrades to the pipeline system, parts of which are cast-iron pipes more than a century old.\n\nThe utility company also faces legal actions from victims of the explosions, including a possible class action lawsuit. Gov. Charlie Baker\u2019s administration has hired an independent evaluator and ordered all natural gas companies to review their pipeline procedures.\n\nThousands of customers, meanwhile, remain without natural gas service for hot water, heat and cooking.\n\nColumbia Gas has said it will need until at least early December to fully restore service. Earlier this week, it announced it had completed a major milestone: replacement of about 44 miles (71 kilometers) of pipeline.\n\nThe company said Thursday it has restored service to 1,510 residential meters and 147 business meters, or roughly 20 percent of the total impacted area.

Another former bank official, Ng Chong Hwa, 51, also known as Roger Ng, was arrested earlier Thursday in Malaysia and accused of circumventing internal accounting controls, prosecutors said.\n\nLeissner\u2019s attorney did not return messages seeking comment. It was not clear if Ng had a lawyer.\n\nA spokesman for Goldman Sachs, which the indictment says raised about $6.5 billion through bond offerings for the fund, said the firm \u201ccontinues to cooperate with all authorities investigating this matter.\u201d\n\nPolice in Malaysia said in July that Low had fled Macau to an unknown destination. Before facing criminal charges, Low became well known in the New York City and Los Angeles club scenes. In 2012, he threw a lavish 31st birthday bash attended by Leonardo DiCaprio, Kim Kardashian and other celebrities that The Wall Street Journal called the \u201cwildest party (Las) Vegas ever saw.\u201d\n\nLow, who remains at large, issued a statement through a spokesman maintaining his innocence.\n\n\u201cMr. Low simply asks that the public keep an open mind regarding this case until all of the evidence comes to light, which he believes will vindicate him,\u201d the statement said.\n\nLeissner acknowledged paying millions of dollars in bribes and kickbacks to government officials in Malaysia and Abu Dhabi, according to court records. He was ordered to forfeit $43.7 million as part of his guilty plea.\n\nThe set of charges represent the first criminal prosecutions in the U.S. arising from the epic corruption scandal at the state investment fund known as 1MDB. The Justice Department in 2016 moved to recover more than $1 billion that it said had been stolen, filing a civil complaint that sought the forfeiture of property, including a Manhattan penthouse, a Beverly Hills mansion, a luxury jet and paintings by Vincent Van Gogh and Claude Monet.\n\nIn a speech last year in Washington, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions denounced the scandal as \u201ckleptocracy at its worst.\u201d The pilfered funds were used on a \u201clavish spending spree,\u201d the attorney general said, including a $265 million yacht and a $100 million investment in the music label EMI.\n\n\u201cIn total, 1MDB officials allegedly laundered more than $4.5 billion in funds through a complex web of opaque transactions and fraudulent shell companies with bank accounts in countries ranging from Switzerland and Singapore to Luxembourg and the United States,\u201d Sessions said.\n\nThe fund, 1Malaysia Development Berhad, was set up in 2009 by then-Prime Minister Najib Razak to promote economic development. It relied primarily on debt to fund investment and economic development projects and was overseen by senior Malaysian government officials, according to court records.\n\nNajib chaired its advisory board and as finance minister held veto power over its activities. Low, a friend of Najib\u2019s stepson Riza Aziz, had no official role at 1MDB but had considerable influence over its dealings and was in frequent contact with Najib, U.S. authorities have said.\n\n\u201cAs noted in the indictment today, Mr. Low held no formal position at 1MDB, nor was he ever employed by Goldman Sachs, or the Governments of Malaysia or Abu Dhabi,\u201d Low\u2019s spokesman said.\n\nThe scandal has already had major political ramifications in Malaysia, where Najib in 2015 sacked his attorney general and a deputy prime minister for demanding answers about 1MDB. A parliamentary inquiry found many irregularities but had no mandate to prosecute.\n\nFormer leader Mahathir Mohamad, outraged over the scandal, came out of retirement and the opposition united behind him in the national elections, leading to Najib\u2019s ouster in May.\n\nNajib and his former treasury chief were charged last week with criminal breach of trust involving 6.64 billion ringgit ($1.6 billion), charges that came on top of 32 earlier counts of corruption, breach of trust and money laundering that Najib faces in connection with the 1MDB scandal.\n\nNajib and Mohamad Irwan Serigar Abdullah, the former treasury secretary-general, pleaded not guilty to misappropriating government funds between December 2016 and December 2017. Police have also seized hundreds of luxury handbags, jewelry and cash \u2014 worth more than $266 million \u2014 during raids on apartments linked to Najib\u2019s family.\n\nAn attorney for Najib, Shafee Abdullah, dismissed the latest charges as \u201cfoolish.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMustian reported from New York.", "", "", "", "No. 14 Penn State (6-2, 3-2 Big Ten, No. 14 CFP) at No. 5 Michigan (7-1, 5-0, No. 5 CFP), 3:45 p.m. EDT (ESPN).\n\nLine: Michigan by 10\u00bd.\n\nSeries record: Michigan leads 13-8.\n\nWHAT\u2019S AT STAKE?\n\nThe Wolverines have a clear path to winning the Big Ten title for the first time since 2004, and maybe to making their first appearance in the College Football Playoff, too.

Mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday the rate on 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages eased to an average 4.83 percent this week from 4.86 percent last week. A year ago, it stood at 3.94 percent.\n\nThe average rate on 15-year, fixed-rate loans slipped to 4.23 percent this week from 4.29 percent last week.\n\nAnxiety over rising interest rates, which result from strength in the economy, has buffeted financial markets in recent weeks and spilled over into the housing market.\n\nU.S. stocks rallied on Tuesday and Wednesday after falling sharply from early October through the last few days of the month \u2014 a skid that wiped out their gains from earlier in the year.\n\nThe combination of higher mortgage rates and increasing home prices has made home ownership less affordable.\n\nDespite the higher borrowing costs, \u201cthe monthly mortgage payment remains affordable,\u201d Freddie Mac chief economist Sam Khater said. For many buyers, he said, the persistent lack of available properties for first-time homebuyers is a bigger hurdle than higher mortgage rates because choices are limited.

Bolsonaro has said he wants Moro to be justice minister or to fill the next vacancy on the Supreme Federal Tribunal, Brazil's top court. Moro told the AP in a statement earlier this week he was honored and considering the possibilities. (AP Photo/Silvia Izquierdo)\n\nRIO DE JANEIRO (AP) \u2014 The Brazilian judge at the center of one of the largest corruption investigations in history said Thursday he would become justice minister in the government of President-elect Jair Bolsonaro, a decision that will be hailed by Brazilians eager for a crackdown on graft but also add to deep polarization after a bruising presidential campaign.\n\nMoro is wildly popular among conservatives and loathed by many on the left, so his decision to join the incoming administration will feed the suspicion of many Brazilians that the judge was politically biased in jailing ex-President Luiz Inacio da Silva, a conviction that forced the poll-leading leftist out of the presidential race.\n\nMoro met with Bolsonaro at the president-elect\u2019s home in Rio de Janeiro on Thursday. Upon emerging, Moro did not speak to reporters but soon put out a statement confirming he had accepted an offer to lead both the justice and public security ministries, which will be combined in Bolsonaro\u2019s government.\n\nMoro said it would be hard to give up being a federal judge after 22 years, but he saw an opportunity to \u201cimplement a strong agenda of anti-corruption and anti-organized crime\u201d in his new role.\n\n\u201cIn practice, this will mean consolidating the advancements against crime and corruption the last years and remove any risks of going backward,\u201d he wrote.\n\nHe added that the sprawling \u201cCar Wash\u201d investigation would continue in the hands of local judges in the southern city of Curitiba, where Moro lives and many of the cases have been tried. He also said he would provide more details on his new role next week.\n\nLaunched in 2014, the \u201cCar Wash\u201d probe uncovered elaborate schemes in which construction companies received bloated contracts and then kicked back billions of dollars in bribes to politicians and other government officials over more than a decade.\n\nThe level of corruption was breathtaking for Brazilians long inured to graft, and the scandal has reverberated across several Latin American countries where Odebrecht, one of the companies at the center of the scandal, did business.\n\nThe investigation has led to the jailing of many of the country\u2019s biggest names. That list includes da Silva, convicted by Moro of corruption for trading favors with construction company Grupo OAS for the promise of a beachfront apartment. Da Silva began serving a 12-year sentence in April.\n\nThe cases made Moro a wildly popular figure with Brazilians exhausted by numerous stories of politicians plundering government coffers; Earlier this year, he tracked highly in presidential polls even though the judge, quiet and wonky, never expressed interest in running.\n\nHowever, many of his tactics have been highly controversial, such as the use of extended pre-trial detentions and plea bargains, both aimed at getting high-profile suspects to talk.\n\nOn social media Thursday, many Brazilians shared a 2016 story in daily Estadao, which quoted Moro saying he had no political ambitions.\n\n\u201cNo, never. Never,\u201d he said when asked about running for office or getting into politics. \u201cI am a man of the justice system.\u201d\n\nMoro has been accused of being partisan, with supporters of da Silva and the left-leaning Workers\u2019 Party claiming Moro was at the center of a conspiracy to keep da Silva, who Brazilians call Lula, from running for president this year. Even after being jailed, da Silva led preference polls. In September, his candidacy was barred.\n\n\u201cMoro will become Bolsonaro\u2019s minister after having a decisive role in his election (victory) by impeding Lula from running,\u201d tweeted Gleisi Hoffman, chairwoman of da Silva\u2019s Workers\u2019 Party, adding: \u201cHe helped elect. Now he\u2019ll help govern.\u201d\n\nIn reality, Moro has convicted politicians from across the political spectrum. But he has also made decisions that many interpret as biased, such as releasing wiretapped conversations between da Silva and then President Dilma Rousseff in 2016.\n\nFor Bolsonaro, a former army captain who ran on promises to crack down on graft and rising crime, landing Moro is a huge boon. Moro, who studied law in Brazil and did a special program at Harvard University, has received numerous awards and honorary degrees related to his work. He frequently speaks in the United States and other countries, and is arguably the world\u2019s most famous anti-corruption crusader.\n\nBolsonaro told reporters outside his home late Thursday that Moro had asked for \u201ctotal liberty\u201d to operate, and he would have it.\n\nStill, the decision comes with huge risks, both for Moro personally \u2014 he now will become \u201cpolitical\u201d as part of an administration \u2014 and the future of the \u201cCar Wash\u201d investigations.\n\nMembers of the \u201cCar Wash\u201d task force have said much work remains, but it\u2019s hard to imagine any judge having the gravitas of Moro, who rose to fame because of his ability to sort through complicated white-collar crimes and write decisions that are rarely overturned.\n\nIn leading the combined ministries of justice and public security, Moro will be ultimately responsible for areas that include intractable problems, such as security. Last year, nearly 64,000 people were killed in Brazil, a record for the country that has long been the world leader in annual homicides.\n\nMoro will oersee the federal police, highway police, the penitentiary system, immigration and several other agencies that in total encompass thousands of employees.\n\n\u201cMoro is making a complicated bet\u201d in taking on a political role, said Mauricio Santoro, a political science professor at the State University of Rio de Janeiro. \u201cEvery government in the world has corruption. How will Moro deal with that?

(AP Photo/Susan Walsh)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The federal website where consumers can get health insurance under the Affordable Care Act was up and running Thursday after a slow start as sign-up season for 2019 opened days before the midterm elections.\n\nDuring early morning hours, people accessing the site were directed to a screen that said work was underway. A recording at the HealthCare.gov call center conveyed a similar message. Things seemed to be running normally by about 9 a.m. EDT.\n\nWith health care a major issue in Tuesday\u2019s elections, this sign-up season under the Trump administration is getting close scrutiny.\n\nIn earlier years, technical problems with the site created major headaches for the Obama administration. Some Democrats cited HealthCare.gov\u2019s meltdown after its 2013 debut as one of the reasons they lost control of the Senate the following year.\n\nSince those initial problems were fixed, the website serving people in 39 states has worked fairly smoothly, first under President Barack Obama and now under Donald Trump. The rest of the states and the District of Columbia run their own sign-ups.\n\nA spokesperson for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said Thursday morning that HealthCare.gov was open for business.\n\nBefore the site went live for sign-ups at the start of a new coverage year, technicians had to load up details on thousands of changes in plans and premiums.\n\n\u201cPrior to every open enrollment, final preparations must take place ahead of the start of the open enrollment period to ensure the website runs smoothly for consumers,\u201d said a statement from the agency. The statement said the agency\u2019s commitment had been that the site would be ready \u201cin the morning.\u201d\n\nThe health law\u2019s sixth sign-up season began with stabilizing premiums and more choices for consumers.\n\nNationally, average premiums are going up only by low single-digit percentages for 2019. In some states, and for some types of plans, premiums will decline. Fewer areas will see increases. Insurers also are expanding their participation.\n\nBut Republicans have not backed off their pledge to fully repeal the health law, despite failing to do so in Trump\u2019s first year. Still, other changes by the GOP-run Congress and the administration for next year may result in fewer people signing up.\n\nCongress did get rid of the unpopular requirement that most people carry health insurance or risk fines, starting Jan. 1. The administration has opened the way for insurers to offer alternatives to the law\u2019s comprehensive coverage, including plans that don\u2019t have to cover pre-existing conditions.\n\nDemocrats have made maintaining protections for pre-existing conditions a major issue in the elections, forcing Republicans on the defensive. They also accuse Trump of trying to \u201csabotage\u201d the health law, and a core group of former Obama administration officials has kept close tabs on sign-up season.\n\nDespite all the political drama, enrollment has remained remarkably stable.\n\nAbout 10 million people have private policies through HealthCare.gov and state-run insurance markets, with roughly 9 in 10 getting taxpayer-financed help to pay their premiums. An estimated 12 million more are covered through the law\u2019s Medicaid expansion, aimed at low-income adults.\n\nIncome-based subsidies that protect consumers from high premiums remain available for next year, as has been the case since the overhaul went into effect.

A Tricentennial literary project, the tall, magenta kiosk is programmed to pluck words from 300 years of San Antonio poetry and create something new.\n\nIt\u2019s the brainchild of Rick Stemm and Stevan Zivadinovic.\n\n\u201cWe feel like it\u2019s the perfect Tricentennial thing,\u201d said Stemm, a playwright and game designer who wrangled the poetry side of the project. \u201cIt\u2019s old and new, it\u2019s historical/contemporary, it\u2019s tech and it\u2019s physical.\u201d\n\nWord Salsa has been roving the city the past few months. It debuted at the Tricentennial gala in May, where Mayor Ron Nirenberg and his wife, Erika Prosper Nirenberg, were the first to avail themselves.\n\nIt now can be found in the lobby of the Carver Community Cultural Center. It will be at Luminaria, the downtown arts festival, on Nov. 10, and will move to another site after that.\n\nIt has its very own website \u2014 wordsalsa.com \u2014 where fans can find out its current location.\n\nTo get a poem, you simply press the lime-green button on Word Salsa\u2019s front panel, then wait a few seconds while it\u2019s generated, emerging on a slim strip of paper like a receipt.\n\nA robotic voice then reads the text aloud. A bell dings when it\u2019s done.\n\n\u201cSometimes, it\u2019s just nonsense,\u201d said Stemm, who teaches with Zivadinovic in the new media program at SAY S\u00ed, a nonprofit arts program for middle and high school students. \u201cAnd then sometimes, it\u2019s really sublime: \u2018Why do it, heavy boulders, Mexico-style, with the milk made pregnant but love me.\u2019\u201d\n\nWord Salsa so far has surpassed 1,400 poems, most of them in the seven-sentence range. They are titled by number. Word Salsa No. 1437 is on the shorter side. It reads, in its entirety: \u201cIf it all: when you took my soul by mecate tied with another state.\u201d\n\nThe poems are generated by a computer program loaded with \u201c130,000 words of San Antonio poetry that went into teaching this robot so it knows how to speak San Antonio,\u201d said Zivadinovic, an artist and game designer who built the kiosk and programmed the computer.\n\nThat includes works of living and long-dead poets. Half of the works are in English and half are in Spanish.\n\nOnce the button is pushed, the computer program basically selects a word at random to start, then determines the next logical word to follow. It keeps going until the poem is complete.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little random, a little rough,\u201d Zivadinovic said.\n\nOne of Stemm\u2019s favorites consists almost entirely of the names of San Antonio Spurs players.\n\n\u201cBecause of the nature of the algorithm, whenever it accidentally got to the first name, the only choice was to rattle off the rest,\u201d Zivadinovic said.\n\nAbout 50,000 of the words in the program came from the poetry of Naomi Shihab Nye. She said yes right away when Stemm and Zivadinovic approached her about the project, handing over PDFs of all of her published work for them to use.\n\n\u201cI loved their enthusiasm for the possibilities in art,\u201d Nye said. \u201cIt\u2019s what many of us like to believe that art can be in our lives, a way to open boundaries between things and shake things up.\u201d\n\nAs a thank you, Zivadinovic gave her a thick stack of new poems the algorithm had generated from words in her work. The pages remain on her desk months later, she said, and she finds herself drawn to them over and over.\n\n\u201cWhen I look at these pages, they\u2019re words that I recognize that I have used in my life, but they have taken on completely new personalities, and so it\u2019s something so innovative that I keep staring at it,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I haven\u2019t put it in a file yet. I keep looking at it, thinking, maybe I should work with these lines. They would be new places to begin.\u201d\n\nOther poets who contributed to the project include Jenny Browne, Victoria Garcia-Zapata, Wendy Barker, Gregg Barrios, Jim LaVilla-Havelin, Carmen Tafolla and Andrea \u201cVocab\u201d Sanderson.\n\nAfter Luminaria, Word Salsa will keep moving from venue to venue through next May. After that, there\u2019s no plan just yet.\n\n\u201cWe may repurpose the parts, we may donate it to the library,\u201d Stemm said. \u201cWe\u2019re not sure.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: San Antonio Express-News, http://www.mysanantonio.com", "", "", "", "", "Nebraska (2-6, 1-4 Big Ten) at No. 8 Ohio State (7-1, 4-1, No. 10 CFP), Noon ET (FOX)\n\nLine: Ohio State by 24.\n\nSeries record: Ohio State leads 5-1.\n\nWHAT\u2019S AT STAKE?\n\nThe Buckeyes look to bounce back strong after a complete collapse at Purdue two weeks ago.

Teva shares surged on the news.\n\nTeva posted a loss of $273 million, or 27 cents a share, compared with earnings of $530 million, or 52 cents a share, the previous year. Revenue fell 19 percent from $5.617 billion to $4.529 billion.\n\nNonetheless, Chief Executive Kare Schultz said in a statement he is \u201cvery satisfied with our progress and we are meeting all our key targets.\u201d\n\nTeva, the world\u2019s No. 1 generic drugmaker, has been hit hard by price pressure and competition in its core generic business, the loss of patent protection on its blockbuster multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone and a more than $30 billion debt load stemming from its acquisition of the generics business of Allergan. The struggling company announced plans last December to cut 14,000 jobs, over one quarter of its global work force.\n\nIn an interview, Schultz said the company has pared its debt down from $35 billion to $27.6 since he joined the company a year ago. He also said the company is well on its way to meeting its goals for cutting its work force and reducing costs.\n\nAs part of its restructuring, the company has already eliminated some 9,000 of the 14,000 jobs it promised to cut by the end of 2019. It also has cut costs this year by $1.8 billion, more than half of the savings it has targeted by the end of next year.\n\n\u201cIn the big picture we are on track, if anything ahead of schedule,\u201d he said.\n\nWith prices crumbling in the key U.S. generics market, Teva has been eliminating unprofitable drugs from its portfolio while focusing on money-making medicines instead.\n\nIt said it sees both the generics market, and Copaxone sales stabilizing, albeit at lower levels than in the past.\n\nBut Teva has introduced two new drugs to the market.

(AP) \u2014 A website popular with racists that was used by the man charged in the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre was shut down within hours of the slaughter, but it hardly mattered: Anti-Semites and racists who hang out in such havens just moved to other online forums.\n\nOn Wednesday, four days after 11 people were fatally shot in the deadliest attack on Jews in U.S. history, anonymous posters on another website popular with white supremacists, Stormfront, claimed the bloodshed at Tree of Life synagogue was an elaborate fake staged by actors. The site\u2019s operator, a former Ku Klux Klan leader, said traffic has increased about 45 percent since the shooting.\n\nThe anti-Semitic rhetoric was just as bad on another site popular with white supremacists, The Daily Stormer, where a headline said: \u201cJust go, Jews. You\u2019re not welcome.\u201d\n\nTrying to stop the online vitriol that opponents say fuels real-world bloodshed is a constant battle for groups that monitor hate, and victories are hard to come by. Shut down one platform like Gab, where the shooting suspect posted a message shortly before the attack, and another one remains or a new one opens.\n\nThe problem dates back to the dawn of the internet, when users connected their computers to each other by dialing telephone numbers. A report issued by the New York-based Anti-Defamation League in 1985 found there were two online \u201cnetworks of hate\u201d in the United States, both run by neo-Nazis who spread anti-Semitic, racist propaganda.\n\nToday, the vastness of the online world is a big part of the problem, said Oren Segal, director of the ADL\u2019s Center for Extremism. Determining how many hate sites exist is nearly impossible, he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really difficult to put an actual number on it, but I would say this: There are thousands of hate sites and there are dozens and dozens of platforms in which hate exists,\u201d Segal said.\n\nA new study by the VOX-Pol Network of Excellence, composed of academic researchers who study online extremism, said the exact number of far-right adherents on just one platform, Twitter, is impossible to determine. But at least 100,000 people and automated accounts are aligned with radicals commonly referred to as the \u201calt-right,\u201d the study found, and the true number is probably more than twice that.\n\nAn ADL report released a day before the shooting said extremists had increased anti-Semitic harassment against Jewish journalists, political candidates and others ahead of the midterm elections. Researchers who analyzed more than 7.5 million Twitter messages from Aug. 31 to Sept. 17 found almost 30 percent of the accounts repeatedly tweeting derogatory terms about Jews appeared to be automated \u201cbots\u201d that spread the message further and faster than if only people were involved.\n\nThe New York-based ADL said that before the 2016 election of President Donald Trump anti-Semitic harassment was rare, but afterward it became a daily occurrence. It commissioned a report in May that estimated about 3 million Twitter users posted or re-posted at least 4.2 million anti-Semitic tweets in English over a 12-month period ending Jan. 28.\n\nThe story of Gab, the platform where Robert Gregory Bowers allegedly wrote an ominous message early Saturday before the shooting, shows how new sites spring up in a hate-filled environment.\n\nCreated in 2016 to counter what founder Andrew Torba viewed as liberal censorship on social networks, Gab gained popularity among white supremacists and other right-wing radicals after tech companies clamped down on racist sites following the deadly clash at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. The Daily Stormer was offline briefly after the violence but re-emerged on a new host.\n\nWith Gab now shut down after the synagogue shooting, Torba is portraying the platform not as a hate-filled corner of the internet, but as a bastion of free speech that\u2019s working with federal authorities \u201cto bring justice to an alleged terrorist.\u201d\n\nA message posted by Torba said Gab was trying to get back online, and Segal has few doubts it will succeed.\n\nDon Black, the former Klan leader who runs Stormfront, said traffic is up partly because of the Gab shutdown and partly because of increased interest among users. His site, which has been in operation since 1995 and has about 330,000 registered users, has only had one \u201cprolonged\u201d shutdown \u2014 a month following the Charlottesville melee, he said.\n\n\u201cI expect all sorts of more trouble now because of the Pittsburgh shooting,\u201d Black said.\n\nPurging hateful content from the internet is a challenge. The Constitution\u2019s guarantee of free-speech provides a roadblock to banning hate speech in the United States, according to the First Amendment Center, a project of the Washington-based Freedom Forum Institute.\n\n\u201cPolitical speech receives the greatest protection under the First Amendment, and discrimination against viewpoints runs counter to free-speech principles. Much hate speech qualifies as political, even if misguided,\u201d said an essay by center scholar David L. Hudson Jr. and Mahad Ghani, a fellow with the center.\n\nSome advocate other tactics for curbing hate.\n\nThree days before the synagogue attack, a coalition that includes the Alabama-based Southern Poverty Law Center, a liberal advocacy organization that monitors hate groups, released a proposed framework aimed at social media companies.\n\nThe plan is geared around a model terms-of-service policy that states that platform users \u201cmay not use these services to engage in hateful activities or use these services to facilitate hateful activities engaged in elsewhere.\u201d Next year, sponsors plan to begin posting report cards showing how sites are doing at quelling hate speech.\n\nNo company has publicly announced plans to adopt the coalition\u2019s guidelines, but Segal said the ADL separately has talked with several social media companies about limiting hate speech. Companies have been welcoming but solutions remain elusive, he said.\n\nSegal added: \u201cThe commitment to eradicating hate from platforms is not always matched by the ability to do so because there is just so much content out there.\u201d", "FILE- In this Sept. 27, 2018, file photo robots weld the cab of a 2018 Ford F-150 truck on the assembly line at the Ford Rouge assembly plant in Dearborn, Mich.

(AP Photo/Carlos Osorio, File)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 American manufacturers grew at a slower pace in October as factories contended with supply disruptions caused by disputes with China, Europe and other trading partners.\n\nThe Institute for Supply Management, an association of purchasing managers, said Thursday that its manufacturing index slipped to 57.7 last month \u2014 down from 59.8 in September and the lowest since April. It was the second straight monthly drop.\n\nStill, anything above 50 signals growth, and manufacturers are enjoying a 26-month winning streak.\n\nNew orders, production, export orders and hiring grew more slowly. Thirteen of 18 manufacturing industries reported growth last month, led by textile mills and makers of electrical equipment.\n\nAmerican industry is generally healthy, but respondents to the ISM survey suggested that trade disputes are taking a toll. The United States has imposed taxes on imported steel and aluminum and on about $250 billion in Chinese products, drawing retaliation from U.S. trading partners.\n\nSeveral companies complained that the tariffs are driving up costs and limiting supplies. Respondents also cited labor shortages and the strains that high demand is putting on their supply chains.\n\nTimothy Fiore, chair of ISM\u2019s manufacturing survey committee, said that \u201c57.7 is not a bad number. But it\u2019s not where we had been. We have been bouncing around the top. This may be the first indicator of a softening that may continue.\u201d\n\nManufacturers are also coping with weakening global economic growth and a strengthening dollar, which makes American products costlier in foreign markets.\n\n\u201cBetween disruptions caused to the supply chain by tariffs and a strengthening dollar, the factory sector may cool off going forward after an extraordinary run in 2017 and 2018,\u201d Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities, wrote in a research note. \u201cNevertheless, even with a weaker-than-expected result in October, for now, the pace of growth for manufacturing remains robust.\u201d\n\nThe economic backdrop for manufacturers remains healthy. Consumer spending on long-lasting manufactured goods was strong during the spring and summer, rising at an annual pace of 6.9 percent from July through September and 8.6 percent from April through June.\n\nFactories are on pace to add more than 250,000 jobs this year, which would be biggest jump in manufacturing employment since 1997.", "DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) \u2014 Gov.

Sounds simple, but decisions over whether and how much to buy can get complicated, and mistakes can be costly.\n\nHere are common mistakes financial planners see:\n\nBUYING TOO MUCH OR NOT ENOUGH\n\nNot everyone needs life insurance.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s no one else depending on your income, you probably don\u2019t need much or any at all,\u201d says Alyssa Lum, certified financial planner and founder of Luminate Financial Planning in Sterling, Virginia.\n\nBut those with young children will need a lot. For breadwinners, a rule of thumb is at least seven times your annual salary, plus money to pay off debt and fund college. \u201cThose dollars really add up,\u201d Lum says.\n\nStay-at-home parents don\u2019t need as much, but should have some coverage, says Greg Klingler, a certified financial planner and director of wealth management for the Government Employees\u2019 Benefits Association. Buy enough to cover child care and other services that the stay-at-home parent provides.\n\nBUYING THE WRONG POLICY\n\nThere two main types of life insurance: term and permanent .\n\n\u2014 Term life insurance is simple, cheap and offers coverage for a certain period, such as 10, 20 or 30 years. It pays out if the policyholder dies during that term.\n\n\u2014 Permanent life insurance, such as whole life, lasts your entire life and includes a savings component called cash value, which grows slowly over many years. You can borrow against the cash value or surrender the policy for the cash. It\u2019s more complicated and expensive than term life. It also nets the highest commission for insurance agents.\n\nTerm life is the best choice for most families, Klingler says, because \u201cmost people are going to have a finite need.\u201d Term life can cover you while the kids are growing up or you\u2019re paying off debt, such as a mortgage. Ideally, at the end of the term, you don\u2019t need life insurance anymore.\n\nYet some people get talked into permanent policies when they all they need is term life, says Jason Speciner, a certified financial planner in Fort Collins, Colorado. Building cash value inside a policy can sound appealing, but fees and the agent\u2019s commission eat away at returns. Instead of pouring money into a permanent policy, max out savings in tax-advantaged retirement accounts. If there\u2019s money left over for long-term investing, a low-cost index fund will probably produce better returns than life insurance, he says.\n\n\u201cIn most cases the old saying, \u2018buy term and invest the difference,\u2019 makes sense,\u201d Speciner says.\n\nPermanent life insurance can be an important estate planning tool for those who have a lifelong financial dependent, such as a child with special needs, or whose estate is big enough to incur taxes for heirs. (Only estates over $11.18 million for an individual and $22.36 million for a couple are subject to federal estate taxes in 2018.)\n\nPUTTING OFF THE PURCHASE\n\nIt\u2019s easier to put off buying life insurance than think about how your death would affect others. \u201cBut that\u2019s a pretty risky gamble, especially if you have small kids,\u201d says Michael Kelley, a certified financial planner in Cleveland, Ohio.\n\nWorried about the cost? It might be cheaper than you think. Most consumers overestimate the price of term life insurance by more than three times, according to a 2018 study by industry groups Life Happens and LIMRA. The study was based on a survey of about 2,000 adults who are household financial decision-makers. The actual cost of a 20-year, $250,000 term life policy for a healthy, 30-year-old nonsmoker is about $160 a year, the study says.\n\nCompare quotes from at least a few companies to find the best rates.\n\nRELYING ON FREE LIFE INSURANCE AT WORK\n\nLife insurance benefits through work probably aren\u2019t enough for those who have a family depending on their income, Speciner says.\n\nThat coverage is typically one to two times your annual salary \u2014 not enough to sustain a family after the loss of a breadwinner. Another drawback: The coverage usually ends when an employee leaves the company.\n\nBuy your own policy if you need life insurance, and consider the free benefits from work a bonus.\n\nThis article was provided to The Associated Press by the personal finance website NerdWallet.

On Thursday, Nov. 1, the Commerce Department reports on U.S. construction spending in September. (AP Photo/Julio Cortez, File)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Spending on U.S. construction projects was essentially unchanged in September, the weakest showing since June, as an increase in home construction was offset by a slide in spending on government projects.\n\nThe Commerce Department said Thursday that the flat reading for September followed a 0.8 percent rise in August.\n\nThe strength last month was driven by a 0.6 percent increase in residential construction and a smaller 0.1 percent increase in nonresidential activity, which pushed this category to an all-time high. However, these gains were offset by a 0.9 percent drop in spending on government projects.\n\nThe increase in residential construction featured an 8.7 percent jump in apartment construction, which offset a 0.8 percent drop in single-family homes.\n\nApartment construction can be volatile from month to month. Overall, the home sector has struggled for much of this year as builders have had to cope with rising costs for land, lumber and labor. Part of the increase in lumber prices stemmed from the higher tariffs the Trump administration has imposed on Canadian softwood lumber.\n\nResidential construction has been a drag on the overall economy, falling every quarter this year. While business construction was strong in the first two quarters, it fell at a 7.9 percent rate in the July-September quarter. The decline was viewed as a potentially worrisome sign that the boost businesses received in bigger tax breaks for investment from the $1.5 trillion tax cut passed last December may be starting to wane.\n\nWhile overall construction was flat last month on a percentage basis, it did climb enough to push total spending to a record annual rate of $1.33 trillion.\n\nThe 0.1 percent rise in private non-residential construction boosted that category to a record annual rate of $463.9 billion, thanks to gains in hotel construction and office building, which offset a drop in spending in the category that includes shopping centers.", "Click to copy\n\nClick to copy https://apnews.com/549b919e7932497080b179b54cd4cbd0", "CHICAGO (AP) \u2014 Chicago Police are looking for a gunman who jumped into a car, demanded money and fatally shot a woman in front of her sister\u2019s two children she\u2019d just taken trick-or-treating.\n\nPolice spokesman Anthony Guglielmi says 21-year-old Maria D.

Jerome Coyle left the Marian Home in Fort Dodge, Iowa, according to a spokeswoman for the Diocese of Sioux City, who said an acquaintance had agreed to take him in.\n\nThe move follows an Associated Press story exposing the diocese\u2019s three-decade cover-up of abuse by Coyle, now 85, who was placed at the home this summer without the knowledge of nearby Saint Edmond Catholic School administrators or parents.\n\nAlso Thursday, the Iowa attorney general\u2019s office said it has opened an information-gathering inquiry into the handling of clergy abuse. Attorney General Tom Miller said that he was appalled by cases of abuse and cover-up that had been documented in Pennsylvania and \u201ccases in Iowa that have gone unreported.\u201d\n\nCoyle admitted in 1986 that he sexually abused approximately 50 boys over 20 years while serving at several Iowa parishes , according to the Sioux City diocese, which never told the public until Wednesday.\n\nThe diocese transferred Coyle to a treatment center in New Mexico and stripped him of his parish assignments. He lived and worked in New Mexico for decades as a civilian.\n\nCoyle moved in with a Catholic family in Albuquerque after suffering injures in a car accident last year. The diocese revealed what Nickless called Coyle\u2019s \u201cpast transgressions\u201d in a February letter to the family warning that it was too risky to allow him to live with their three teenage children.\n\nThe diocese eventually moved Coyle in June into the Marian Home, an assisted living center. It\u2019s across the street from Saint Edmond, which has hundreds of students from kindergarten through high school.\n\nIn a video and letter to parishioners issued Wednesday, Nickless claimed that the diocese moved Coyle back to Iowa \u201cbecause of his advanced age and frail condition.\u201d\n\nBut in February, a diocese review board that includes Nickless sought to discourage Coyle from returning, warning that his presence could traumatize his now-adult victims and that the move would be difficult due to his age. The diocese told the family housing him that the best option was to find Coyle an assisted living center there, and that it would increase his monthly assistance by $575 to help.\n\nNickless claimed Wednesday that Coyle was under \u201cstrict supervision\u201d at the Marian Home. AP journalists didn\u2019t see signs of that when visiting Coyle\u2019s apartment Friday, where he answered the door and declined comment.\n\nThe diocese acknowledged that school administrators weren\u2019t informed about Coyle\u2019s past when he was placed there.\n\nIn a letter to parents, school President Mary Gibb wrote that she was \u201cdeeply sorry\u201d they had learned of the situation through news reports. She said that none of the students had contact with Coyle during visits to the Marian Home because they do not go to the area where he lived.\n\n\u201cThe safety of our students is and will always be my #1 priority,\u201d wrote Gibb, who declined comment when contacted about Coyle last week.\n\nCoyle reported his abuse to then-Bishop Lawrence Soens, who hung up when reached at a retirement home Thursday.\n\nLynn Hicks, a spokesman for Iowa\u2019s attorney general, said his office doesn\u2019t have the legal authority to conduct a statewide investigative grand jury like one that recently found 300 \u201cpredator priests\u201d had abused 1,000 children in Pennsylvania.

A federal jury in Denver has ruled against the couple, finding that a neighboring marijuana grow operator did not hurt their property values. It was the first time a jury considered a lawsuit using federal anti-racketeering law to target a marijuana company. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File)\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 A Colorado jury likely threw cold water on future legal challenges against cannabis companies by homeowners who consider filing racketeering lawsuits alleging proximity to pot operations hurts their property values, analysts and industry lawyers said Thursday.\n\nA federal jury in Denver on Wednesday rejected claims involving the odor from a pot farm made in a case that was closely watched by the marijuana industry.\n\nIt was the first such lawsuit to reach a jury. Three others are pending in California, Massachusetts and Oregon.\n\n\u201cThe big takeaway is that the verdict is likely to curb the enthusiasm for bringing these lawsuits in the future,\u201d Vanderbilt University law professor Rob Mikos said.\n\nHe said it\u2019s easy to show marijuana companies are violating federal laws against pot, but the Colorado verdict shows the difficulty In proving actual harm.\n\n\u201cThere was a thought that this would be easy money,\u201d Mikos said about such claims.\n\nCongress created the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act \u2014 better known as RICO \u2014 to target the Mafia in the 1970s. It allowed prosecutors to argue that leaders of a criminal enterprise should pay a price along with lower-level defendants.\n\nThe law also allows private parties to file lawsuits claiming their business or property has been damaged by a criminal enterprise. Those who can prove it can be financially compensated for damages plus attorneys\u2019 expenses.\n\nScott Schlager, a lawyer who filed a similar lawsuit against a Cambridge, Massachusetts, dispensary agreed with Mikos, saying racketeering lawsuits are expensive to litigate.\n\n\u201cThey shouldn\u2019t be the next cottage industry,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a lot of uncertainty.\u201d\n\nSchlager said the Denver verdict will have no effect on his case because the two legal actions have important differences.\n\nThe Colorado plaintiffs complained that a farm\u2019s odor lowered their property value by about $30,000.\n\nSchlager\u2019s clients in Harvard Square argue that the stigma of a marijuana dispensary in the upscale business district lowered property values by $29 million.\n\nCalifornia attorney Ken Stratton, who represents a pot farmer being sued by eight homeowners near Petaluma, California, in the heart of wine country, said he was surprised the Denver case reached a jury.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ll see more and more of these knocked out before they go to trial,\u201d Stratton said. \u201cThe racketeering law wasn\u2019t meant to litigate land disputes.\u201d\n\nHe also predicted the Denver verdict will make other lawyers and disgruntled neighbors look elsewhere to settle their disputes with marijuana operations.\n\nHe said showing that cannabis operations impact land prices is difficult, especially if the homeowners are speculating rather than arguing they lost money in actual sales.\n\nEmma Quinn-Judge, a Boston lawyer defending the Cambridge dispensary, agreed that showing harm is the biggest hurdle.\n\n\u201cIf you know anything about Cambridge home prices then you know that arguing their value has dropped $29 million is laughable,\u201d she said.", "DAYTON, Ohio (AP) \u2014 Astronauts will undergo advanced centrifuge training at an Ohio Air Force base this week.\n\nThe Dayton Daily News reports nine NASA astronauts and one Boeing astronaut are scheduled to receive medical evaluations and training at Wright-Patterson Air Force base outside Dayton on Thursday and Friday.

Lebanon and Morocco are taking part as observers.\n\nEgypt has been holding separate drills with each of these five Arab nations in recent years, but \u201cArab Shield\u201d will be the first time that all six will be simultaneously participating in war games.\n\nThe announcement came a little more than a month after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met in New York with the foreign ministers from the six nations participating in this month\u2019s maneuvers plus those from Oman and Qatar to advance the idea of creating a Sunni alliance uniting America\u2019s Middle East partners against Shiite and non-Arab Iran.\n\nHowever, the Egyptian military statement made no link between the war games and the proposed alliance, which Egypt may be approaching with caution given its sectarian undertones.\n\nEgypt, however, has become heavily dependent on financial assistance and investments from Gulf heavyweights like Saudi Arabia and the UAE and that might in turn influence its decision on whether to join the proposed alliance.\n\nA prominent Egyptian analyst on Thursday warned against such an alliance, framing its creation as part of an ongoing process to replace Israel with Iran as the Arabs\u2019 chief enemy and emphasizing that differences between the Arabs and Iran can be politically settled.\n\n\u201cIsrael is not a friend and this is a fact despite all attempts to ignore it,\u201d wrote Abdullah el-Sinnawy in the independent al-Shorouk newspaper, alluding to growing public contacts between Israel and Gulf Arab nations that, unlike Egypt and Jordan, don\u2019t have diplomatic relations with Israel.\n\n\u201cWhere will the alliance\u2019s front line (against Iran) be? The Arab NATO project is about military confrontation that will be fueled by Israeli participation and no one will be able to bear its grave consequences,\u201d he wrote.\n\nQatar has reacted with skepticism to the proposed alliance, citing its yearlong dispute with Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain and Egypt. The four nations have since June 2017 boycotted Qatar, demanding that the tiny but super wealthy nation limit its diplomatic ties with Iran, shut down the state-funded Al-Jazeera news network and sever ties to radical Islamic groups like the Muslim Brotherhood and Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah. Qatar denies supporting Islamist groups.\n\nOman is highly unlikely to join the alliance, given its close relations with Iran and its traditional role as a mediator in regional or international conflicts involving Tehran.\n\nThe U.S. proposed alliance follows the derailment three years ago of efforts to create a joint Arab force agreed on at a March 2015 Arab summit in Egypt. That force was to be led by an Egyptian and headquartered in Saudi Arabia. But a meeting of military chiefs of staff that was to iron out details of the force was canceled in the last minute in August 2015 and another one was never scheduled.\n\nLast year, Saudi Arabia announced the creation of an Islamic military alliance to fight terrorism. Defense chiefs from some 40 Muslim majority nations gathered for the alliance\u2019s inaugural meeting in Riyadh a year ago, but little has been heard of the grouping since.\n\nEgypt is a member of a Saudi-led, U.S.-backed coalition that has been fighting Shiite rebels in Yemen since 2015, but its role in the conflict is known to be limited to reconnaissance and the deployment of warships off Yemen\u2019s Red Sea coastline to secure shipping lanes.\n\nHowever, Egypt\u2019s military is likely to be a key partner in the proposed alliance.\n\nThe most populous Arab nation, Egypt under general-turned-president Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi has become one of the world\u2019s top arms buyers. It has spent billions of dollars, mainly in Russia, France and Germany, to acquire fighter jets, submarines, troop carriers and helicopter gunships.\n\nIts recent arms purchases are on top of some $1.3 billion worth of American arms it buys annually under a U.S. military aid program in place since Egypt signed a 1979 peace treaty with Israel.", "LONDON, Ky.

Scott Walker, left, and his Democratic challenger Tony Evers in the 2018 November general election. (Wisconsin State Journal via AP, File)\n\nMADISON, Wis. (AP) \u2014 Republican Gov. Scott Walker, locked in a tight re-election bid, said Thursday for the first time that he wants to enact the \u201cexact same language\u201d that\u2019s in federal law at the state level guaranteeing insurance for people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nHowever, the proposal would not protect as many people as the federal law does and it\u2019s unclear whether there\u2019s enough support in the Republican-controlled Legislature to pass it.\n\nWalker previously supported a bill to guarantee coverage that was not as expansive as what is guaranteed under the federal Affordable Care Act. That bill stalled in the state Senate.\n\nWalker\u2019s new promise, made to reporters following a campaign stop in Waukesha as he faces the toughest election of his political career, was derided as a lie by Democratic challenger Tony Evers. A Marquette University Law School poll on Wednesday showed the race to be a dead heat, with health care as a top issue.\n\n\u201cNo matter what happens in the courts or in the Congress, in Wisconsin we\u2019ll codify that, the exact same language that\u2019s in the Affordable Care Act. We\u2019ll make sure everyone living with a pre-existing condition is covered here in the state,\u201d Walker said.\n\nWalker is a longtime opponent of the federal law and this year approved Wisconsin joining a federal lawsuit seeking its full repeal, including the popular protection for people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nThe Assembly passed the more limited bill earlier this year, but it died in the Senate. A spokesman for Republican Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald declined to comment Thursday, and he seesawed last month on whether the original proposal had the votes to pass. Assembly Speaker Robin Vos did not return a message.\n\nAlso, a state law like Walker is promising would not protect everyone.\n\nIf the federal law is overturned, people in Wisconsin who get their insurance through a self-funded employer plan would lose their protections because only the federal government can regulate those plans, the nonpartisan Legislative Council said in an Oct. 18 memo.\n\nMore than 150 companies in Wisconsin have self-funded plans, including Kimberly-Clark Corp., Kwik Trip, Kohler Co., Schneider National and Snap-On, Inc.\n\nEvers said in a statement that \u201cactions speak louder than words\u201d and Walker\u2019s long-held opposition to the federal law and its protections for people with pre-existing conditions shows he can\u2019t be trusted.\n\n\u201cPoliticians like Scott Walker are always talking out of both sides of their mouth and telling last-minute lies like this,\u201d Evers said.\n\nThe fight played out as Walker, Evers and other candidates were blanketing the state, with surrogates including House Speaker Paul Ryan and White House counselor Kellyanne Conway in tow.\n\nRepublican Senate candidate Leah Vukmir was campaigning with Ryan and Walker on a bus tour from Waukesha to Green Bay. Vukmir had a separate stop with Conway in Appleton. She also won the endorsement of former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice on Thursday.\n\nEvers is on his own tour \u2014 in a yellow school bus \u2014 through western and northern Wisconsin starting in Tomah and ending in Ashland. Baldwin was campaigning in Marshfield and Mauston before ending in Madison where she urged college students to vote early, before casting her own ballot. She said it was the first time she\u2019s ever voted early in an election where she was on the ballot.\n\nEvers launched a new campaign ad Thursday emphasizing criticism of Walker from four of his former Cabinet secretaries. Three of them signed a letter urging a vote for Evers, while a fourth said Walker was not being truthful about his roads budget.\n\nWalker, who is seeking a third term, has dismissed the criticism saying it shows he\u2019s willing to surround himself with people who have differing viewpoints. The ad is Evers\u2019 14th of the campaign, while Walker has run a staggering 33 ads. Walker and Republicans have outspent Evers and Democrats roughly 2-to-1 on television.\n\nWalker, in an interview with WTMJ radio in Milwaukee, acknowledged the closeness of the race and urged his supporters to vote and work to get others out.\n\n\u201cYou can change the polls,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Carrie Antlfinger contributed to this report from Waukesha, Wisconsin.\n\n___\n\nFollow Scott Bauer on Twitter: https://twitter.com/sbauerAP\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "HEMPSTEAD, Texas (AP) \u2014 A Houston-area sheriff\u2019s deputy has died after floodwaters filled her patrol vehicle that had veered off a road and overturned.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear what caused the Waller County deputy\u2019s vehicle to leave the road Wednesday.

Proposed state Constitutional Amendment 1 on the Nov. 6, 2018, ballot would require Missouri state House and Senate districts to be drawn to achieve \"partisan fairness\" and \"competitiveness.\" (AP Photo/David A. Lieb, File)\n\nJEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) \u2014 A growing movement to curb partisan gerrymandering will be put to the test Tuesday by several state ballot measures that are intended to overhaul the way congressional and state legislative districts are drawn.\n\nWhile they differ in how to do that, the proposals in Colorado, Michigan, Missouri and Utah all have at least one thing in common: They\u2019re receiving funding from a little-known organization bankrolled by a Texas billionaire couple.\n\nThe Action Now Initiative financed by John and Laura Arnold has poured $7.7 million into the redistricting campaigns, accounting for one of every four dollars raised by groups backing the ballot measures, according to an analysis by The Associated Press. That\u2019s helped supporters significantly outspend their opponents.\n\n\u201cOur interest in these efforts is about giving citizens, not politicians, a greater voice in the drawing of their voting district lines,\u201d said Sam Mar, CEO of the Action Now Initiative.\n\nThe Arnolds\u2019 organization tops a list of the rich and famous who have rallied to the cause, including former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, heirs of Walmart founder Sam Walton, actress Jennifer Lawrence and former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican who took a break from filming a movie in Europe to appear at rallies in Michigan and Colorado.\n\nThe only comparable opposition has come from the Michigan Freedom Fund. The conservative group with ties to the wealthy DeVos family has put more than $3 million into a home-state opposition effort.\n\nThe enhanced attention to the drawing of legislative district lines comes as Democrats and Republicans alike are trying to position themselves to take charge of the task after the 2020 Census.\n\nIn many states, redistricting is done by the state legislature subject to the approval of the governor. A political party that holds a trifecta of power \u2014 as Republicans do in three times as many states as Democrats \u2014 can draw districts to its advantage, a technique known as gerrymandering.\n\nRepublicans currently have trifecta control in Michigan, Missouri and Utah. Colorado has a Democratic governor and House but a Republican-led Senate.\n\nThe ballot measures are intended to reduce the likelihood of partisan gerrymandering in the future, no matter which party is in power.\n\nProposals in Michigan and Colorado would create independent commissions to redistrict U.S House and state legislative chambers, similar to those already in place in California and Arizona.\n\nColorado\u2019s two proposals require mapmakers to \u201cmaximize the number of politically competitive districts,\u201d while the Michigan measure says districts \u201cshall not provide a disproportionate advantage to any political party.\u201d\n\nUtah\u2019s proposal also would prohibit districts that unduly favor any political party while creating a new redistricting commission, although it leaves the final say on proposed maps with the Legislature and governor.\n\nThe Missouri proposal, which keeps an existing bipartisan commission for state legislative redistricting, would go a step further by requiring the use of a statistical formula to achieve \u201cpartisan fairness\u201d and \u201ccompetitiveness\u201d as top criteria over the traditional standard of geographically compact districts.\n\nThe Arnolds\u2019 Action Now Initiative didn\u2019t write the redistricting measures. But once local activists showed some momentum, the Houston-based organization came to their aid. It contributed $5.1 million to the Michigan initiative, about $1 million each to the Missouri and Utah initiatives and about $600,000 to the Colorado initiative, according to campaign finance records.\n\nThat money supplemented thousands of small-dollar donations from others, helping the state-based organizations defend against legal challenges, pay for voter research and develop messaging for their campaigns.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of momentum and a lot of people and a lot of volunteers. But the one thing we didn\u2019t have was some of those larger dollar donors, because we had never been involved in the political process before,\u201d said Katie Fahey, founder and executive director of Voters Not Politicians, which is sponsoring the Michigan initiative.\n\nIn Missouri, the Action Now Initiative provided an additional incentive for fundraising by offering to match contributions from others up to a certain amount, said Sean Nicholson, campaign director for the sponsoring group Clean Missouri.\n\nThe redistricting measures are part of an \u201celectoral reform\u201d effort by the Action Now Initiative that is intended to promote \u201cresponsive and accountable government,\u201d said Mar, the CEO. Those priorities also include open primaries and ranked-choice voting, in which voters indicate preferences for multiple candidates to help determine a winner if no one gets a majority.\n\nJohn Arnold is a former energy hedge fund manager who retired as a billionaire in 2012 at age 38. Laura Arnold is an attorney and former oil company executive. The Arnolds have bankrolled causes across the political spectrum, from conservative-leaning efforts to expand school-choice programs and overhaul public pensions to liberal-leaning initiatives to tax soft drinks and carbon emissions. Most of their personal political contributions have gone to Democrats, though they have supported some Republicans.\n\nThe Michigan initiative also received $5.5 million from the Sixteen Thirty Fund, a Washington-based entity that supports liberal causes but does not have to disclose its donors because it\u2019s set up as a social welfare nonprofit. That combined with the funding from the Action Now Initiative accounted for two-thirds of the $15.7 million raised by Voters Not Politicians through Oct. 21.\n\n\u201cAny time you have that kind of out-of-state money coming in to put something in our constitution, it should make people very skeptical,\u201d said Tony Daunt, executive director of the Michigan Freedom Fund, which also is exempt from disclosing its donors.\n\nAlthough there has been little opposition in Colorado or Utah, the Michigan Republican Party has criticized the initiative\u2019s sponsors as a \u201cfront group\u201d for Democrats. Missouri\u2019s Republican Party also has asserted that the initiative is crafted to benefit Democrats, but opponents have struggled to raise money.\n\n\u201cRedistricting is not the sort of thing that on its face attracts a lot of interest,\u201d said former Republican U.S. Sen Jim Talent, chairman of the Missourians First opposition committee. \u201cYou have to explain what the impact of this would be.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow David A.

The sides have conducted 68 independent patrols before the combined patrols started.\n\nU.S. Central Command said in a news release that a ground force commander agreed on by both countries will lead the joint patrols.\n\nMaj. Gen. Christopher Ghika, deputy commander of operation Inherent Resolve, said recent training by Turkish and coalition forces will help them to protect Manbij civilians.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re fully supportive of the road map and the combined joint patrols, and I am confident they will be very effective,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Manbij Military Council that administers the town says the Kurdish militia, the People\u2019s Protection Units, or YPG, which Turkey views as a terrorist group, left Manbij in July.\n\n\u201cThe aim of these patrols is to reduce tension and guarantee stability so that there will be no tension along the front line,\u201d Darwish said by telephone from northern Syria.\n\nTurkey considers the YPG a terrorist group because of its links to the Kurdish insurgency in southeastern Turkey. It had threatened to storm Manbij to oust the group from the region.\n\nThe Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitor, also said the patrols would follow days of Turkish shelling of positions of the main Kurdish militia.\n\nThe Observatory and Kurdish spokesman Mustafa Bali said Turkish troops opened fire on the border village of Tal Fandar killing an 11-year-old girl.\n\nTurkey\u2019s state-run Anadolu Agency quoted Akar as saying that despite promises that the YPG and other Kurdish militias \u201cwill be removed from Manbij, the terror organizations are digging trenches there like they did in Afrin.\u201d He was referring to a Kurdish enclave taken earlier this year by Turkish troops and Turkey-backed Syrian opposition fighters.\n\n\u201cThe terror organization should know that they will be buried in the trenches when the time and place comes,\u201d Akar said.\n\nLast week, Army Gen.

But they later backed down, with Deputy Police Chief Srivara Ransibrahmanakul saying Monday that the lyrics were insufficient evidence to launch a prosecution, so people were allowed to listen to, sing, and share the song.\n\nDechathorn Bamrungmuang, one of the rappers in \u201cPrathet Ku Mee,\u201d said at a seminar Wednesday that he thinks the song grew quickly in popularity because hip-hop is becoming more and more popular around the world.\n\n\u201cWhen the song came out, there were both negative receptions and supportive messages to us,\u201d he said. \u201cThis made us feel like we can communicate with people through our music and that this song doesn\u2019t overstep any boundaries.\u201d", "BC-FBN--Halfway Stories Advisory,0660\n\nEDITORS:\n\nThe AP will be moving an NFL Halfway package beginning Nov. 5.

(AP) \u2014 A gunman who attacked a Maryland police station created a \u201ccombat zone\u201d that led to an officer mistakenly killing an undercover detective, a prosecutor said Thursday in urging a jury to convict the gunman of murder for starting the videotaped shootout.\n\nJurors are expected to begin deliberating Friday to decide if Michael Ford is guilty of second-degree murder and other charges in the friendly-fire shooting death of Prince George\u2019s County police detective Jacai Colson in March 2016.\n\nFord, 25, testified this week that he opened fire on the station because he wanted police to kill him and didn\u2019t intend for anyone else to be harmed.\n\nBut county prosecutor Joseph Ruddy said Ford had gone on a \u201ccombat mission.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was no suicide mission. That was a mission to kill cops,\u201d Ruddy said in the trial\u2019s closing arguments.\n\nOfficer Taylor Krauss mistook his fellow officer for a threat and shot Colson after the detective exchanged gunfire with Ford, authorities say. Krauss testified that he never saw Colson hold up a badge or heard him identify himself as a police officer before shooting him once in the chest.\n\nFord\u2019s two younger brothers used their cellphones to record the attack, which lasted nearly four minutes.\n\nFord, who was wounded in the shootout, fired 23 shots from a handgun, according to prosecutors. He didn\u2019t hit anyone, but his bullets struck two passing cars and an ambulance.\n\n\u201cIt was an attack on humanity,\u201d Ruddy said.\n\nFord\u2019s attorney, Antoini Jones, said it is \u201cundisputed\u201d that Ford was on the ground and had been \u201cneutralized\u201d before Krauss fired the shot that killed Colson.\n\nJones said Ford was having \u201csuicidal thoughts\u201d and had held a gun to his head earlier that day. But he didn\u2019t have the \u201cwherewithal\u201d to kill himself, so he tried to goad police into killing him instead, his lawyer said.\n\n\u201cIf (he) was charged with attempted suicide, he would be guilty of that,\u201d Jones said.\n\nA judge ruled before trial that Ford couldn\u2019t present an insanity defense despite his serious mental health issues.\n\nFord\u2019s two younger brothers recorded cellphone videos of the ambush after dropping him off at the station in Landover, a suburb of Washington, D.C.\n\nOne of the videos shows Ford screaming obscenities and shouting, \u201cDo something!\u201d in between shots.\n\nA police detective testified in 2016 that Ford\u2019s brothers agreed to film the shooting so the video could be sent to a website known for posting users\u2019 violent videos.\n\nHis brothers, Malik and Elijah, pleaded guilty to related charges and await sentencing hearings.\n\nRuddy said Ford wanted his brothers to film the attack \u201cto show everybody how badass he was.\u201d Ford testified he didn\u2019t know they were recording.\n\nA grand jury declined to indict Krauss on any charges related to Colson\u2019s shooting.\n\nFord is black and so was Colson. Krauss is white.\n\nColson and Krauss had worked in the narcotics unit together and sat at connecting desks.\n\nColson was a four-year veteran of the department and 28-year-old native of Boothwyn, Pennsylvania.\n\nRuddy called him a hero for confronting Ford.\n\n\u201cHe was brave, and it cost him his life,\u201d he added.", "President Donald Trump speaks during a campaign rally at Columbia Regional Airport, Thursday, Nov. 1, 2018, in Columbia, Mo.

On Thursday, Nov. 1, the Labor Department issues data on productivity in the third quarter. (AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez, File)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 U.S. productivity grew at an annual rate of 2.2 percent in the third quarter, a slowdown from the previous quarter but still better than the lackluster gains of the last decade. Labor costs accelerated but remained at a low level.\n\nThe rise in productivity in the July-September period followed a 3 percent rate of increase in the second quarter, which had been the strongest figure in three years. Labor costs rose at a 1.2 percent rate after having fallen at a 1 percent rate in the second quarter.\n\nProductivity, the amount of output per hour of work, has been weak throughout the current recovery that began in June 2009. Analysts have been unable to come up with definitive reasons for the slowdown.\n\nProductivity last year rose by just 1.1 percent. Over the past decade, productivity has been up at an average annual rate of 1.3 percent, just about half the 2.1 percent gains seen in the seven decades starting in 1947. The period from 2000 to 2007 saw even stronger annual gains of 2.7 percent, a burst that was credited to efficiency improvements achieved with the introduction of high-tech computers and other devices to the workplace.\n\nA slowdown in the third quarter had been expected given that overall output, as measured by the gross domestic product, slowed to a still-strong annual rate of 3.5 percent in the April-June quarter after a sizzling 4.2 percent growth rate in the second quarter. With less output and hours worked rising at a rate of 1.8 percent, productivity edged lower.\n\nEconomists said they were not concerned about the slight acceleration in labor costs. The Federal Reserve closely watches various gauges of compensation to make sure that wages and salaries, the biggest component of business expenses, are not rising at such a rapid pace that the economy could be in danger of overheating.\n\n\u201cAny rise in core inflation from here will be very modest, allowing the Fed to continue with its policy of gradually normalizing interest rates,\u201d said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics.\n\nFinding a solution to the slowdown in productivity growth is one of the key economic challenges facing the country. Rising productivity is critical to boosting standards of living because productivity gains allow companies to pay workers more without having to increase the cost of their products, which can be inflationary.\n\nEconomists are uncertain why productivity has remained static during a nine-year expansion. Some explanations include the difficulty of pulling out of the deep 2007-2009 recession and reluctance of companies to invest in new productivity-enhancing equipment.\n\nWithout a significant improvement in productivity, the Trump administration will find it difficult to achieve its goal of sustained GDP growth of 3 percent or better each year. An economy\u2019s potential for growth is determined by an expansion in the labor force, which is determined largely by birth rates and immigration, as well as the growth in productivity.\n\nIn a separate report, the Labor Department said that the number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits, a proxy for layoffs, dipped by 2,000 last week to 214,000, further evidence of a healthy labor market. The government will release the October unemployment report on Friday and the expectation is that the jobless rate will remain at a 49-year low of 3.7 percent.", "PORTSMOUTH, Va.

(AP Photo/Richard Vogel, File)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Amazon wants to get more kids thinking about becoming computer engineers.\n\nThe company launched a program Thursday that aims to teach more than 10 million students a year how to code. Amazon said it will pay for summer camps, teacher training and other initiatives to benefit kids and young adults from low-income families who might not have learned to code otherwise. It hopes the programs spur more black, Hispanic and female students to study computer science.\n\nAmazon declined to put a price tag on the program, called Amazon Future Engineer, but said it will take up a big chunk of the $50 million that it committed to spend on computer science education last year.\n\nOther corporations, including Microsoft and Facebook, have also committed cash to bring coding to schools, which could ultimately benefit the companies. There\u2019s a shortage of computer engineers, and teaching students to code will ensure a pipeline of future talent to hire.\n\nJeff Wilke, Amazon\u2019s chief executive of worldwide consumer, said he hopes some of the students who go through the Amazon Future Engineer program will work for the company, creating skills for its Alexa voice assistant or programming its delivery drones. But he said other companies are increasingly relying on technology, and coding has become a valuable skill to more employers.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re pretty confident that knowing how to code will be as important as knowing how to read for the jobs of the future,\u201d Wilke said.\n\nAmazon Future Engineer will offer kids in kindergarten through eighth grade free summer camps and after-school programs that will take place in Amazon offices around the country. Amazon employees will volunteer, and online classes, lessons and games will be provided by Amazon\u2019s partners, such as Code.org and Coding with Kids. The company also said it plans to pay for online training for teachers at 2,000 low-income high schools around the country to teach to teach introductory and college-level advance placement computer science classes. In addition, it will offer college students scholarships and internships. Schools, teachers and parents will be able to apply through AmazonFutureEngineer.com .\n\nAmazon said some schools have been testing the program, including Monsignor Scanlan High School in New York. Science teacher Jennifer Tulipano began taking coding classes online in September and started teaching two computer science classes that month where the students learn how to create games and make animated characters dance. It\u2019s the first time the school has offered computer science classes.\n\nTulipano said the school applied for the Amazon program because more students were getting feedback from colleges saying they needed some background in computer science.\n\n\u201cSo much is now online,\u201d Tulipano said. \u201cIt\u2019s a skill set they need moving forward if they want to go into these fields.\u201d"]
