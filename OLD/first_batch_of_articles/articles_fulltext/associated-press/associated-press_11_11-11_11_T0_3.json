The camp\u2019s flag has a falanga, a far-right symbol dating to the 1930s of a stylized hand with a sword.\n\nThere were also a few flags of Forza Nuova, an Italian group whose leader, Roberto Fiore, describes himself as fascist. One of the organizers of the march, Krzysztof Bosak, insisted that Forza Nuova are nationalists who are in touch with the Polish group.\n\nAmong the slogans that participants shouted were \u201cUSA, empire of evil\u201d and \u201cPoland, white and Catholic.\u201d Members of one nationalist group, eurosceptic All-Polish Youth, burned a European Union flag. An EU flag was also burned at another nationalist rally in Wroclaw. The city\u2019s mayor dissolved the march by nationalists toward its end, during speeches by far-right leaders.\n\nOver the past decade, nationalist organizations have held Independence Day marches in Warsaw on Nov. 11 that have included racist slogans, flares and in some years, acts of aggression.\n\nSunday\u2019s was by far the largest Independence Day march to date, and it was mostly peaceful. Government spokeswoman Joanna Kopcinska called it \u201cthe biggest march of free Poles in a free Poland.\u201d\n\nThis year, in honor of the centennial, state officials sought to hold one big government-led march for Sunday\u2019s ceremonies. At first, negotiations broke down over requests for the radical groups to leave banners at home, but an agreement on a joint march was reached on Friday.\n\n\u201cLet this be our joint march, let it be a march for everyone, a march where everyone wants to be and feels good, marching for Poland,\u201d Duda said at the start of the march.\n\nDuda and the government faced criticism from liberal opposition politicians for their willingness to negotiate with nationalists, including some who have made anti-Semitic comments in the past. After some individuals showed up with extremist emblems, the state officials \u2014 surrounded by security \u2014 appeared to try to keep some distance from the nationalists, marching ahead of them on the same route.\n\nThroughout the day, observances, Masses, marathons and fireworks were held in cities and small towns to commemorate the nation\u2019s statehood regained at the end of World War I, after 123 years of foreign rule.\n\nThe national flag fluttered from buildings, buses and cars, while dignitaries and regular citizens placed flowers at memorials to the father of Polish independence, Marshal Jozef Pilsudski. The historic Sigismund Bell, reserved only for the most important national events, rang out over Krakow.\n\nMarch participant Bartlomiej Mazur, 23, who travelled 320 kilometers (200 miles) to the capital, said he wanted to show that \u201cPoland is a strong, proud nation.

International leaders are taking place in a ceremony in Paris on Sunday to mark the 100th anniversary of the Armistice that ended World War I. (AP Photo/Christophe Ena)\n\nJERUSALEM (AP) \u2014 A fresh wave of fighting erupted between Israeli forces and Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip on Sunday, leaving an Israeli soldier and seven Palestinians dead, just as Israel and Gaza\u2019s Hamas rulers had appeared to be making progress toward ratcheting down months of border violence.\n\nIt was not immediately clear what set off the sudden, rare late-night burst of violence.\n\nIn a statement early Monday, the Israeli military said an officer was killed and another one was moderately injured during \u201can operational activity\u201d in southeast Gaza Strip in which an exchange of gunfire was evolved. The operation had ended and the families of the soldiers were notified, it added.\n\nEarlier, Hamas\u2019 armed wing, the Qassam Brigades, said Israeli undercover forces in a civilian vehicle infiltrated three kilometers (two miles) into Gaza and fatally shot Nour el-Deen Baraka, its local commander in Khan Younis town. It said militants discovered the car and chased it down, prompting Israeli airstrikes that killed \u201ca number of people.\u201d The clashes cooled down early Monday.\n\nThe Israeli military reported earlier that \u201call IDF soldiers back in Israel.\u201d It did not elaborate.\n\nThe Palestinian Health Ministry said six people, including at least five militants, were killed and seven others wounded. In the early hours, a seventh body was found.\n\nIn Israel, the military said it had intercepted two rockets fired from Gaza as air raid sirens continued to sound.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, on an official visit to France, announced he was rushing back to Israel to deal with the crisis.\n\nSunday\u2019s development shattered what appeared to be a turning point after months of bloodshed along the Israel-Gaza border, with weekly Hamas-led protests drawing thousands to the perimeter fence with Israel. Over 170 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire in the border protests, in which Palestinians throw rocks, burning tires and grenades toward Israeli troops.\n\nLast week, Israel allowed Qatar to deliver $15 million in aid to Gaza\u2019s cash-strapped Hamas rulers. Hamas responded by lowering the intensity of Friday\u2019s border protest.\n\nEarlier Sunday, Netanyahu had defended his decision to allow the transfer of the Qatari money, rejecting criticism that the move had strengthened the Islamic militant group.\n\nNetanyahu told reporters that it was \u201cthe right step\u201d at the moment and that he was committed to restoring quiet along the Israel-Gaza frontier and preventing a humanitarian crisis in the coastal Palestinian territory.\n\n\u201cEvery action, without exception, has a price,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you can\u2019t handle the price you cannot lead. And I can handle the price.\u201d\n\nIsraeli critics, including members of Netanyahu\u2019s hard-line coalition, accused him of capitulating to violence and of granting relief to the embattled Hamas group.\n\nThe internationally backed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, whose forces lost control of Gaza to Hamas in 2007, angrily accused the U.S. and Israel of being involved in a \u201cconspiracy\u201d to permanently sever Gaza from the West Bank. He promised to take unspecified measures against his Hamas rivals in the coming days.\n\nHamas leaders in Gaza have described the arrival of the $15 million, delivered last week in three suitcases by a Qatari diplomat, as their first major gain of more than seven months of weekly protests along the perimeter fence.\n\nHamas has been leading the protests since March 30 in a bid to ease a crippling Israeli-Egyptian blockade that was imposed in 2007 in order to weaken the militant group. The blockade has led to over 50 percent unemployment and chronic power outages, and prevents most Gazans from being able to leave the tiny territory.\n\nIsrael says it is defending its border against militant infiltrations, but its army has come under international criticism because of the large number of unarmed protesters who have been shot.\n\nWith Hamas threatening to intensify the protests and international officials warning of a looming humanitarian crisis, Netanyahu on Thursday allowed the cash into Gaza. It is the first installment of $90 million that Qatar has pledged to cover the salaries of thousands of unpaid Hamas employees for six months.\n\nIsraeli opposition figures lambasted Netanyahu for appearing to cave in to violence. Army Radio played decade-old sound clips of Netanyahu, from when he was the opposition leader, threatening tough action against Hamas and criticizing his predecessor for being too soft.\n\nEven his erstwhile allies attacked him for indirectly doing business with a militant group that has fought three wars against Israel and is sworn to Israel\u2019s destruction.\n\n\u201cEveryone knows where that money is going to go ultimately,\u201d said Netanyahu\u2019s agriculture minister, Uri Ariel.\n\nBut in comments to reporters before traveling to Paris, Netanyahu said it was a \u201cquestion of alternatives.\u201d He said the step was coordinated with security officials to restore quiet for Israeli citizens living near the Gaza border and to avert a humanitarian crisis.\n\nLater, at a press conference in Paris, when asked about his longer-term vision for Gaza, Netanyahu said there could be no political resolution as long as Hamas is in power.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t have a political resolution with those who are committed to your dissolution, to your destruction. That\u2019s absurd,\u201d he said. The alternative is to \u201cdo the minimal things necessary to maintain our security and to prevent the collapse of the humanitarian situation,\u201d he added.\n\nThe payment is part of what is expected to be a set of informal understandings between Israel and Hamas reached through Egyptian and U.N. mediation.\n\nHamas is demanding an expansion of the permissible fishing zone off the Israeli-controlled Gaza coast, uninterrupted flow of fuel to mitigate chronic power shortages and the lifting of Israeli restrictions on exports and imports. In return, Israel wants quiet and an end to the border protests.\n\nFor the second week in a row, the Palestinians kept Friday\u2019s protests carefully restrained, burning fewer tires and refraining from breaching the fence.\n\nIn the West Bank, Abbas angrily accused Israel and the U.S. of ganging up behind his back to entrench Hamas\u2019 control over Gaza. He also accused Hamas of undermining his goal of establishing an independent Palestinian state that includes all of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.\n\nAbbas fears that the U.S. is preparing to float a peace plan, called the \u201cDeal of the Century\u201d by President Donald Trump, which would leave Hamas in control of Gaza and give him only limited autonomy in pieces of the West Bank.\n\n\u201cWe are going to take tough measures (against Hamas) in the coming days,\u201d Abbas said.\n\n\u201cThere is an American conspiracy, which is the \u2018Deal of the Century,\u2019 and there is an Israeli conspiracy to implement the \u2018Deal of the Century,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cTo my dismay, there is another conspiracy from Hamas to foil the independent state.\u201d\n\nAbbas, speaking at a ceremony marking the 14th anniversary of the death of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, did not elaborate on what steps he might take against Hamas.\n\nAbbas has repeatedly limited financial aid to Gaza in order to pressure Hamas into returning control to him.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Josef Federman reported in Jerusalem and AP writer Fares Akram reported from Gaza City, Gaza Strip.", "From first shot to silence of peace: Timeline of World War I\n\nONE OF ONE HUNDRED PHOTOS WORLD WAR ONE CENTENARY TIMELINE-In this June 28, 1914 file photo, the Archduke of Austria Franz Ferdinand, center right, and his wife Sophie, center left, walk to their a car in Sarajevo.

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\n\nPARIS (AP) \u2014 For President Donald Trump in Paris, America First meant largely America alone.\n\nAt a weekend commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I, the president who proudly declares himself a \u201cnationalist\u201d stood apart, even on a continent where his brand of populism is on the rise.\n\nHe began his visit with a tweet slamming the French president\u2019s call for a European defense force, arrived at events alone and spent much of his trip out of sight in the American ambassadors\u2019 residence in central Paris. On Sunday, he listened as he was lectured on the dangers of nationalist isolation, and then he headed home just as the inaugural Paris Peace Summit was getting under way.\n\nThe visit made clear that, nearly two years after taking office, Trump has dramatically upended decades of American foreign policy posture, shaking allies. That includes French President Emmanuel Macron, who on Sunday warned that the \u201cancient demons\u201d that caused World War I and millions of deaths were once again making headway.\n\nMacron, who has been urging a re-embrace of multinational organizations and cooperation that have been shunned by Trump, delivered a barely-veiled rebuke of Trumpism at the weekend\u2019s centerpiece event: A gathering of dozens of leaders at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at the base of the Arc de Triomphe to mark the passage of a century since the guns fell silent in a global war that killed millions. Bells tolled across Europe\u2019s Western Front and fighter jets passed overhead to mark the exact moment the devastating war came to a close.\n\nWith Trump and other leaders looking on, Macron took on the rising tide of populism in the United States and Europe and urged leaders not to turn their backs by turning inward.\n\n\u201cPatriotism is the exact opposite of nationalism: Nationalism is a betrayal of patriotism,\u201d Macron said, adding that, when nations put their interests first and decide \u201cwho cares about the others\u201d they \u201cerase the most precious thing a nation can have... Its moral values.\u201d\n\nAfter Trump was gone, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who recently announced that she will not be seeking re-election, made an impassioned plea for global cooperation at the peace forum, saying World War I had \u201cmade clear what disastrous consequences a lack of compromise in politics and diplomacy can have.\u201d\n\nTrump, who has made clear that he has limited patience for broad, multilateral agreements, sat mostly stone-faced as he listened to Macron, who sees himself as Europe\u2019s foil to the rising nationalist sentiment, which has taken hold in Hungary and Poland among other countries.\n\nTrump did engage with his fellow leaders, attending a group welcome dinner hosted by Macron at the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay on Saturday night and a lunch on Sunday. He also spent time with Macron on Saturday, when the two stressed their shared desire for more burden-sharing during a quick availability with reporters.\n\nBut Trump was terse during some of his private conversations with world leaders, according to people with direct knowledge of his visit. One of the people described the president as \u201cgrumpy.\u201d They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss private conversations.\n\nThe symbolism during Trump\u2019s visit couldn\u2019t have been more stark.\n\nTrump was missing from one of the weekend\u2019s most powerful images: A line of world leaders, walking shoulder to-shoulder in a somber, rain-soaked procession as the bells marking the exact moment that fighting ended \u2014 11 a.m. on Nov. 11, 1918 \u2014 finished tolling.\n\nThe president and first lady Melania Trump had traveled to the commemoration separately \u2014 White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders cited security protocols \u2014 from the other dignitaries, who had traveled together by bus from the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace.\n\nAs Trump\u2019s motorcade was making its solo trip down the grand Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, which was closed to traffic, at least one topless woman breached tight security, running into the street and shouting \u201cfake peace maker\u201d as the cars passed. She had slogans, including the words \u201cFake\u201d and \u201cPeace,\u201d written on her chest.\n\nPolice tackled the woman and the motorcade continued uninterrupted. The feminist activist group Femen later claimed responsibility.\n\nAlso traveling on his own was Russian President Vladimir Putin, who shook Trump\u2019s hand, flashed him a thumbs-up sign and patted Trump\u2019s arm as he arrived. Trump responded with a wide smile.\n\nNational Security Adviser John Bolton had said at one point that Putin and Trump would meet in Paris, but they will instead hold a formal sit-down later this month at a world leaders\u2019 summit in Buenos Aires. A Kremlin official said later that U.S. and Russian officials decided to drop plans for the Paris meeting after French officials objected.\n\nTrump, who ran on an \u201cAmerica First\u201d platform, has jarred European allies with his actions. He has slapped tariffs on the European Union, pulled the U.S. out of the landmark Paris Climate Accord and the Iran nuclear deal and suggested he might be willing to pull the U.S. out of NATO if member counties don\u2019t significantly boost their defense spending. Trump\u2019s eagerness to get along with the Russian leader \u2014 in spite of Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 election and numerous other aggressive moves in recent years \u2014 has alarmed those who view Russia as a growing threat.\n\nTrump has also repeatedly branded himself a \u201cnationalist,\u201d despite criticism from some that the term has negative connotations. At a news conference last week, Trump defended his use of the phrase. \u201cYou know what the word is? I love our country,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cYou have nationalists. You have globalists. I also love the world and I don\u2019t mind helping the world, but we have to straighten out our country first. We have a lot of problems.\u201d\n\nBut Trump did not broach the divide as he paid tribute Sunday to U.S. and allied soldiers killed in World War I during \u201ca horrible, horrible war\u201d that marked America\u2019s emergence as a world power.\n\n\u201cWe are gathered together at this hallowed resting place to pay tribute to the brave Americans who gave their last breath in that mighty struggle,\u201d Trump said at the Suresnes American Cemetery and Memorial in the suburbs of Paris, where more than 1,500 Americans who died in the war are buried.\n\n\u201cIt is our duty to preserve the civilization they defended and to protect the peace they so nobly gave their lives to secure one century ago,\u201d he said after spending a moment, standing alone amid the cemetery\u2019s white crosses, holding a black umbrella.\n\nThe Veterans Day speech came a day after Trump was criticized for failing to visit a different American cemetery about 60 miles (100 kilometers) outside of Paris on Saturday because rain grounded the helicopter he had planned to take. A handful of senior administration officials, including White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, went in the president\u2019s place, while Trump remained behind at the ambassador\u2019s residence with no alternate schedule for hours.\n\nTrump delivered the speech as other leaders were gathered for the inaugural Paris Peace Forum, which aims to revive collective governance and international cooperation to tackle global challenges. Afterward he headed back to Washington.\n\nFrance was the epicenter of World War I, the first global conflict.

She currently has 92 dogs at the facility and 140 total in her care \u2014 three on the verge of giving birth.\n\n\u201cMost of my puppies are born into rescue,\u201d Badillo said. \u201cI\u2019ve worked really hard and I\u2019m really tired.

(AP) \u2014 For 16-year-old Hussain Khalil, Advanced Placement courses mean top teachers who are \u201creally passionate\u201d about their subjects and classmates with like-minded attitudes about school.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re very smart. They\u2019re very committed. They\u2019re committed to do the work,\u201d said the 11th grader at Winter Park High School. And, he added, \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a lot of work.\u201d\n\nBut that work in his AP calculus, computer science and English literature classes seems worthwhile, Hussain said, for the academic challenge and the chance to earn college credit if he earns passing scores on the national AP exams.\n\nThat\u2019s also the view of Orange County school leaders, who have pushed to expand AP offerings in the school district\u2019s 20 traditional high schools. The classes are meant to mimic introductory college courses and are offered in 38 subjects, from art history to chemistry to U.S. history.\n\nBut Orange\u2019s AP effort, mirrored in districts across Central Florida and state, has rankled some educators and parents, who think too many students are enrolled in AP courses they don\u2019t really want to take, then left to deal with too much homework and stress.\n\n\u201cIt was just overwhelming him,\u201d said Robin Pappas, of her now-12th grader\u2019s first AP class as a freshman at Apopka High School. \u201cHe would have two to three hours of homework every night with just that class.\u201d\n\nWhen Pappas spoke to a school counselor, she was told she couldn\u2019t get him switched to another class, so her son stuck it out. He has continued to take AP classes, and Pappas said she\u2019s pleased he\u2019s had some \u201camazing teachers.\u201d\n\nBut when her daughter started at Apopka High in August and was enrolled in an AP class she didn\u2019t request, the family quickly insisted she be moved out of the class.\n\n\u201cI would love if they would at least listen to parents,\u201d Pappas said.\n\nOrange\u2019s AP push is part of a Florida initiative that began in 2000 with a partnership with the College Board, which runs the AP program. Florida started urging its public high schools to open up AP classes, once reserved for a select few, to more students. For reasons of equity and fairness, they wanted many more teenagers given a chance to prove themselves in these rigorous classes.\n\nThe partnership worked, with the number of AP exams taken in the state swelling from fewer than 63,000 in 1998 to nearly 400,000 this year.\n\nThe increase in AP exam taking can be seen across Central Florida. In Lake County, the region\u2019s smallest school district, the number of AP exams taken has jumped by more than 1,400 since 2014.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve opened the door,\u201d said Seminole County Superintendent Walt Griffin.\n\nOnce kept small and exclusive, AP classes aren\u2019t forced on anyone but now are strongly encouraged, with counselors telling parents, Griffin said, \u201cYour child is very capable, let them try it.\u201d\n\nThe state propelled its AP increase, in part, by paying the AP exam fees \u2014 now $94 a test \u2014 that would otherwise fall to students\u2019 families, by offering teachers bonuses when their students pass AP exams and by making success on AP exams a factor in its A-to-F grading formula for high schools.\n\nFlorida last year was ranked fourth in the nation for AP success, with nearly 31 percent of its high school graduates earning at least one passing AP score.\n\nIn the annual \u201cstate of the schools\u201d speech in September, Orange Superintendent Barbara Jenkins said the Orange school district was first in Florida for growth in AP exam taking. She also noted that last year more Orange students (33 percent) graduated with at least one passing AP score than did students in top-performing Massachusetts (32 percent).\n\n\u201cLet me brag,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cThat number is higher than the highest performing state in the country,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s Orange County Public Schools.\u201d\n\nDistrict administrators said they consider individual students\u2019 academic needs but also think many benefit from AP\u2019s taste of college-level work. \u201cThe district believes all students have potential when and if they are academically challenged,\u201d it said in an emailed statement.\n\nBut AP detractors note the failure rates on the exams are often high, which in their view means students are unprepared or advised to take too many AP courses.\n\nAs in years past, the passing rates on AP exams in Central Florida, and across the state, in 2018 varied widely by high school and by subject. At Dr. Phillips High School in Orlando, for example, more than half the students passed AP biology but just a third passed the AP English literature exam. The school-wide passing rates in Central Florida ranged from a high of 73 percent at Hagerty High School in Seminole to a low of 8 percent at Jones High School in Orlando.\n\nAcross Florida, students earned passing scores \u2014 a 3 or better on the five-level scoring system \u2014 on about 53 percent of the exams they took.\n\nMatthew Fitzpatrick, an assistant director in the school district\u2019s career and technical program, ran for chair of the Orange County School Board this summer, campaigning in part on the issue of AP classes. Fitzpatrick lost the race but his campaign messages struck a chord with his Facebook posts on the topic prompting lots of comments from sympathetic teachers and parents.\n\nHe started worrying about AP policies when his daughter was a senior at Apopka High. She wanted to take three AP classes \u2014 but counselors scheduled her for five, and he had to press hard to get her out of the two she didn\u2019t want.\n\n\u201cIf we are just forcing students in it, there\u2019s a lot of collateral damage that happens,\u201d he said.\n\nHe thinks the district\u2019s AP push means teachers must teach AP courses even if they aren\u2019t well versed in the subject, with their tasks made more difficult because some students are pressured to enroll.\n\n\u201cHalf the class wants to be there; half the class doesn\u2019t want to be there,\u201d Fitzpatrick added. \u201cNow the teacher is trying to drag kids along,\u201d he said, to the detriment of those students \u201cwho want to soar.\u201d\n\nMichael Daniels, whose two children attend Freedom High School in south Orange, unsuccessfully ran for school board with a campaign platform that made AP classes an issue.\n\nHis message: Dual enrollment classes are better than AP for students looking to earn college credit and reduce college expenses. His frustration: \u201cIf you aren\u2019t very aggressive, they will stuff them into an AP class.\u201d\n\nStudents who pass dual enrollment classes earn the credit, with no need to take a national exam. Credit in AP classes is harder to come by since a passing exam score, or a 3, is required on top of the course work, noted Daniels, director of Nova Southeastern University\u2019s Orlando campus.\n\nAnd sometimes that is not enough. In a number of subjects the University of Florida, for example, won\u2019t give course credit unless a student earned at least a 4 on the AP exam.\n\nFor AP supporters, however, the classes are valuable, no matter how students do on the exams.\n\nDaniel Farmer, who teaches AP English classes at Winter Park, said the courses help students learn to read more quickly, take good notes, write well and \u201creally just be prepared for that college-level experience.\u201d\n\nHe sometimes hears from parents who worry about the workload or say \u201cmy kid needs to have fun in high school.\u201d And he has occasionally approved a student dropping out.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a balance,\u201d Farmer said. \u201d If we can push them, and we can support them, that\u2019s probably what we should do.\u201d\n\nAnya Legaspi, 16, a Winter Park senior, said she\u2019ll graduate with 15 AP classes on her transcript, and she\u2019s happy about every one, even AP physics 1, the class in which she didn\u2019t pass the AP exam last year.\n\n\u201cI learned a lot,\u201d she said.\n\nHer advice to other students: \u201cIf you can handle it, do it.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Orlando Sentinel, http://www.orlandosentinel.com/", "(From L) Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Morocco's Prince Moulay Hassan, Moroccan King Mohammed VI, US First Lady Melania Trump, US President Donald Trump, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife Brigitte Macron, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Australian Governor-General Peter Cosgrove attend a ceremony the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, France, as part of the commemorations marking the 100th anniversary of the 11 November 1918 armistice, ending World War I, Sunday, Nov. 11, 2018.

Nationalism is a betrayal of patriotism,\u201d he said. \u201cIn saying \u2018Our interests first, whatever happens to the others,\u2019 you erase the most precious thing a nation can have, that which makes it live, that which causes it to be great and that which is most important: Its moral values.\u201d\n\nWATCH: President Trump, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other world leaders attend World War I armistice commemorations in Paris hosted by French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\n\n\nMore at: https://t.co/f4T7pbfmuR pic.twitter.com/k0brUmJaVT \u2014 AP Europe (@AP_Europe) November 11, 2018 VIDEO: Watch how the ceremonies unfolded.\n\nTrump, ostensibly the main target of Macron\u2019s message, sat stony-faced. The American president has proudly declared himself a nationalist. But if Trump felt singled out by Macron\u2019s remarks, he didn\u2019t show it. He later described the commemoration as \u201cvery beautiful.\u201d\n\nAs well as spelling out the horrific costs of conflict to those with arsenals capable of waging a World War III, the ceremony also served up a joyful reminder of the intense sweetness of peace, when high school students read from letters that soldiers and civilians wrote 100 years ago when guns finally fell silent on the Western Front.\n\nBrought alive again by people too young to have known global war themselves, the ghostly voices seemed collectively to say: Please, do not make our mistakes.\n\n\u201cI only hope the soldiers who died for this cause are looking down upon the world today,\u201d American soldier Capt. Charles S. Normington wrote on Nov. 11, 1918, in one of the letters. \u201cThe whole world owes this moment of real joy to the heroes who are not here to help enjoy it.\u201d\n\nThe Paris weather \u2014 gray and damp \u2014 seemed aptly fitting when remembering a war fought in mud and relentless horror.\n\nThe commemorations started late, overshooting the centenary of the exact moment when, 100 years earlier at 11 a.m., an eerie silence replaced the thunder of war on the front lines. Macron recalled that 1 billion shells fell on France alone from 1914-1918 .\n\nAs bells marking the armistice hour rang across Paris and in many nations ravaged by the four years of carnage, Macron and other leaders were still on their way to the centennial site at the Arc de Triomphe.\n\nUnder a sea of black umbrellas, a line of leaders led by Macron and his wife, Brigitte, marched in silence on the cobbles of the Champs-Elysees, after dismounting from their buses.\n\nTrump arrived separately, in a motorcade that drove past three topless protesters with anti-war slogans on their chests who somehow got through the rows of security and were quickly bundled away by police. The Femen group claimed responsibility. French authorities said the three women faced charges of sexual exhibitionism. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders cited security protocols for the presidential motorcade\u2019s solo trip down the grand flag-lined avenue, which was closed to traffic.\n\nLast to arrive was the Russian president, Putin, who shook Trump\u2019s hand and flashed him a thumbs-up. German Chancellor Angela Merkel was positioned in pride of place between Trump and Macron, an eloquent symbol of victors and vanquished now standing together, shoulder to shoulder. Overhead, fighter jets ripped through the sky, trailing red, white and blue smoke in homage to the French flag.\n\nThe geographical spread of the more than 60 heads of state and government who attended, silent and reflective, showed how the \u201cwar to end all wars\u201d left few corners of the earth untouched but which, little more than two decades later, was followed so quickly and catastrophically by the even deadlier World War II.\n\nOn the other side of the globe, Australia and New Zealand held ceremonies to recall how the war killed and wounded soldiers and civilians in unprecedented numbers and in gruesome new, mechanized ways.\n\nThose countries lost tens of thousands of soldiers far away in Europe and, most memorably in the 1915 battle of Gallipoli, in Turkey. In central London, Britain\u2019s Queen Elizabeth II, clad in black, watched from a balcony as her son Prince Charles laid a wreath on her behalf at the foot of the Cenotaph memorial that honors the fallen. Britain had 880,000 military dead in the war.\n\nThe gulf between Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d credo and European leaders was starkly underscored again later Sunday, when Trump went his own way.\n\nHe visited an American cemetery outside Paris at precisely the moment that Macron, Merkel and other dignitaries were opening a peace forum where the French leader again sounded the alarm about crumbling international harmony as he ruminated about the legacy of the morning\u2019s commemorations.\n\n\u201cWill it be the shining symbol of durable peace between nations or will it be a picture of a last moment of unity before the world goes down in new disorder?\u201d Macron asked. \u201cIt depends only on us.\u201d\n\nVIDEO: The ceremonies put Macron and his wife, Brigitte, in center stage, as hosts of the 60-plus heads of state and government who converged on Paris.\n\nWhile praising France for \u201ca wonderful two days,\u201d Trump described his rainy stop at the American cemetery at Suresnes as \u201cthe highlight of the trip.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, Trump drew criticism for canceling a separate commemorative visit to the Belleau Wood battleground northeast of Paris because of rain.\n\nRemembered for brutal trench warfare and the first use of chemical weapons, WWI pitted the armies of France, the British empire, Russia and the U.S. against a German-led coalition that included the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires. Almost 10 million soldiers died, sometimes tens of thousands on a single day.\n\nThe U.S. came late to the war, in April 1917, but over 1\u00bd years it became a key player and tipped the scales for the allies. At the war\u2019s end, the U.S. had 2 million troops in Europe and another 2 million ready to cross the Atlantic if needed, a force that turned the United States into a major military power whose soldiers then fought and died again for Europe in World War II.\n\nEven though Germany was at the heart of provoking two world wars over the past century, the nation has become a beacon of European and international cooperation since.\n\nWith so many leaders in Paris, the commemoration also provoked a flurry of diplomacy on the sidelines, with conflict in Yemen and Syria among the hot-button issues.\n\nOn Sunday, Merkel met with the head of the United Nations, an organization born from the ashes of World War II, and the president of Serbia. It was a Serb teenager, Gavrilo Princip, who assassinated the Austro-Hungarian crown prince in Sarajevo in 1914 to set off events which led to the outbreak of war.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Angela Charlton, Sylvie Corbet, Elaine Ganley and Thomas Adamson contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFor more information on World War I, go to The Associated Press\u2019 WWI hub: https://www.apnews.com/WorldWarI\n\n___\n\nWorld War I: An AP Centennial Commemorative Edition.

(NYPD via AP, File)\n\nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) \u2014 The deaths of two young Saudi sisters, whose bodies washed up along the New York City waterfront last month, have shined a light on the often secretive and risky journeys Saudi women take to flee their homes, both within the kingdom and abroad.\n\nTala Farea, 16, and Rotana Farea, 23, ran away from home in Fairfax, Virginia before being placed in a shelter amid allegations they were abused at home.

Under the kingdom\u2019s guardianship system women must have the approval of a male relative \u2014 such as a father, husband, brother, or even a son \u2014 to marry, obtain a passport or travel.\n\n\u201cThe fact that they continue to be subjected to the guardianship system ... to the more sort of sinister issues which include physical or sexual abuse that they face at home, we\u2019ve seen women in all these cases attempt to flee,\u201d said Human Rights Watch researcher Adam Coogle.\n\nCoogle said there are also women being pressured into marriages against their will. He did not specifically discuss the Farea sisters as their case is still under investigation.\n\nIn other instances, women are being barred by their guardians from marrying or their salaries are being confiscated.\n\nIf women who run away are caught, they can be pressured to return home or placed in shelters where often the only way out is to escape again. Others are jailed and only a male guardian can sign for their release.\n\nLast year, Saudi women\u2019s rights activist Mariam al-Otaibi spent more than 100 days in the women\u2019s section of al-Malaz prison in Riyadh after her father filed a complaint to police against her for leaving home. She\u2019d moved from the ultraconservative province of Qassim to the capital, where supporters helped her rent an apartment and find work.\n\nShe was released after her case attracted the attention of activists and rights groups.\n\nAlso last year, a plea for help by a 24-year-old Saudi woman triggered a firestorm on social media with people seeking details about her disappearance. In an online video, Dina Ali Lasloom said her passport was confiscated at an airport in the Philippines on her way to Australia where she planned to seek asylum.\n\nWomen\u2019s rights advocates in Saudi Arabia said Lasloom was ultimately forced to board a plane to the kingdom with two of her uncles, who flew from Riyadh to stop her. They said authorities then took her to a women\u2019s shelter because of the attention around her case. A Saudi woman who tried to meet Lasloom at the airport in Riyadh to assist her was detained for several days by authorities.\n\nA group of Saudi women\u2019s rights activists had raised money locally for runaways and were planning to start a non-governmental organization to shelter abused women. But in May, authorities arrested at least nine of them and three of their male supporters. They remain detained on vague charges related to national security.\n\nFor runaway Saudi women, fleeing can be a matter of life and death, and they are almost always doing so to escape male relatives.\n\nIt\u2019s a problem Saudi society is grappling with. State-aligned newspapers report when women flee shelters and articles question the level of care and support women receive at such facilities.\n\nThe shelters have been described by Saudi activists as prison-like. Women inside cannot freely access the internet or mobile phones, their movements are restricted and often the only way to leave is with the signature of a male guardian. The shelters say they offer women psychiatric care and therapy, but do not take in women who, for example, are pregnant out of wedlock. Premarital sex can lead to criminal prosecution in Saudi Arabia and other Muslim countries.\n\nThe most recent statistics from the Ministry of Labor and Social Development show that 577 Saudi women tried to flee their homes in 2015. That figure is likely to be much higher in reality because many families don\u2019t report runaways due to social stigma.\n\nThe Farea sisters had moved to the U.S. from Saudi Arabia with their mother and two brothers in 2015. The father spent time between the two countries, according to Arab News, which spoke to a relative.\n\nInvestigators say they believe the Farea sisters had filed for asylum. One of the problems women face in seeking asylum, though, is proving abuse.\n\n\u201cYou have to have evidence for it and unless you have a threatening text (message), you may not have a very good asylum case,\u201d said Coogle of Human Rights Watch.\n\nAfter the Farea sisters died, witness called police with something he said had been \u201chaunting\u201d him. He\u2019d seen the sisters standing apart at Riverside Park in New York, with their heads bowed into their hands praying loudly hours before their bodies were found. Investigators have stopped short of saying the sisters killed themselves, but say they have \u201cno credible information that any crime took place.\u201d\n\nThe sisters\u2019 bodies were returned to Saudi Arabia on Nov. 3 and they were buried the same day in Medina \u2014 home to one of Islam\u2019s holiest sites where the Prophet Muhammad is buried.\n\n\u201cThis is a tragedy all the way around,\u201d said Shea, the chief of detectives in New York.\n\n___\n\nFollow Aya Batrawy on Twitter at https://twitter.com/ayaelb .", "1 of 9 California quarterback Chase Garbers, center, scores against Southern California during the second half of an NCAA college football game in Los Angeles, Saturday, Nov. 10, 2018. California won 15-14. (AP Photo/Alex Gallardo)\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Patrick Laird took his fourth-and-1 carry deep into Southern California territory with less than two minutes left, and the roars from a hearty contingent of California fans echoed in a mostly silent Coliseum.\n\nThe Golden Bears are bowl-eligible and riding high after a landmark victory, while the Trojans have hit yet another low.\n\nChase Garbers threw a touchdown pass and ran for another score, and Cal snapped its 14-game losing streak against USC with a 15-14 victory Saturday night.\n\nVic Wharton III made his first TD catch of the year as the Golden Bears (6-4, 3-4 Pac-12) rallied from a 14-point halftime deficit and secured bowl eligibility for just the second time in seven seasons with their first win at the Coliseum in 18 years.\n\n\u201cIt means a lot, and I\u2019m so happy for all of our guys,\u201d said Laird, a fifth-year senior who has never played in a bowl. \u201cThe first goal of our team was to get six wins to make it to a bowl game. It means so much more to do it here, too.\u201d\n\nTwo programs that appear to be moving in opposite directions kept going their separate ways while Cal beat USC (5-5, 4-4) for the first time since its famed 34-31, triple-overtime victory over the vaunted Trojans in Berkeley in 2003.\n\nThe Trojans hadn\u2019t lost to the Bears at the Coliseum since 2000, coach Paul Hackett\u2019s final season at USC before Pete Carroll took over.\n\n\u201cThe streak and all that, we don\u2019t really talk about it,\u201d said Cal coach Justin Wilcox, the former USC defensive coordinator. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know about it until somebody brought it up this week. We\u2019re not playing the streak. These guys are competing and playing for each other.\u201d\n\nCal did all of its scoring in an eight-minute span of the third quarter, starting with a safety when a shotgun snap by USC\u2019s Toa Lobendahn went 22 yards backward into the end zone. Garbers threw a 29-yard TD pass on the ensuing offensive drive, and he rushed for another score 6 \u00bd minutes later after Traveon Beck\u2019s interception.\n\nJ.T. Daniels passed for 180 yards and threw two TD passes to Tyler Vaughns, but the Trojans were shut out in the second half of their third loss in four games.\n\nUSC gained just 40 yards after halftime against Cal\u2019s sturdy defense while losing at the Coliseum for the second straight game after a 19-game home winning streak through the entire tenure of coach Clay Helton.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to get overemotional and say the ship is sinking,\u201d Helton said when asked about the state of his program after three losses in four games and its first five-loss regular season since 2012. \u201cFor us right now, we\u2019re making too many mistakes across the board. I\u2019m sorry for the 5-5 season, but better days are here to come. ... I believe in our kids. I believe in their ability.\u201d\n\nBoth defenses were solid early on a chilly night at the Coliseum, but the Trojans appeared to be in good shape for yet another win over their upstate rivals despite failing on a fake field goal in the first quarter.\n\nA few minutes after Vaughns caught a 2-yard TD pass in the second quarter, Ajene Harris stripped Garbers following a 23-yard run. Daniels then hit Vaughns for a 23-yard score.\n\nUSC could have had more, but Cal\u2019s Luc Bequette stripped the ball from St. Brown at the Cal 10 in the final minute before halftime.\n\nAfter managing only 69 yards of offense in the first half, the Bears quickly got back in it. After Cal got a safety on that horrific shotgun snap, Garbers promptly threw a 29-yard TD pass down the middle to an unguarded Wharton, who somehow hadn\u2019t scored in 10 games as a starting wideout despite leading the Bears in yards receiving.\n\nGarbers had only 30 yards passing all night before that 29-yard scoring throw.\n\nDaniels then threw his first interception to Traveon Beck, and Garbers mounted Cal\u2019s go-ahead drive culminating in his 5-yard TD run. Garbers celebrated by raising the Trojans\u2019 famed V for Victory gesture \u2014 and then turning the \u201cV\u2033 downward.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nCalifornia: Despite another mediocre offensive game, coach Justin Wilcox has more tangible proof of progress in his second year with this gutsy win in a tough venue. The Bears will go bowling, and they\u2019re riding momentum into the Big Game with Stanford next week.\n\nUSC: Helton\u2019s second game as the Trojans\u2019 play-caller was good in stretches, but not nearly good enough. His seat is even hotter now, and it\u2019ll be scorching if the Trojans don\u2019t beat UCLA to secure bowl eligibility next week before No. 3 Notre Dame visits after Thanksgiving.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nCalifornia: Host Stanford in the 121st Big Game on Nov. 17.\n\nUSC: At UCLA in the annual crosstown showdown on Nov. 17.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "MANILA, Philippines (AP) \u2014 Philippine prosecutors said Sunday they will file charges of tax evasion against a news website that has been critical of President Rodrigo Duterte.\n\nThe Justice Department said in a statement it found probable cause to indict Rappler Holdings Corp. and its president, journalist Maria Ressa.

(AP Photo/Chris Carlson)\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Calgary Flames goalie David Rittich was more than happy to share the credit after getting his first career shutout.\n\nIt was a perfectly reasonable position from Rittich after seeing the hard work put in on both ends of the ice by defenseman Travis Hamonic and the Flames.\n\nRittich stopped 21 shots and Hamonic scored to help the Flames to a 1-0 win over the Los Angeles Kings on Saturday night.\n\n\u201cI get a shutout, but they didn\u2019t have too much because our team played pretty good,\u201d said Rittich, who has won three straight starts and five of his past six. \u201cI have to say thank you to the locker room because they played really good.\u201d\n\nThe Flames have won five of their past six games.\n\nJack Campbell made 35 saves for the Kings, who have been held to one goal or fewer in six of their first 16 games.\n\nThe Flames went in front 2:26 into the first period. Hamonic got his second goal, with Garnet Hathaway setting a screen that kept Campbell from seeing the shot to the far post. Austin Czarnik and Noah Hanifin had assists, with Hanifin picking up his third in the past four games.\n\n\u201cI mean, I don\u2019t score much, so it was nice. A bonus,\u201d Hamonic said. \u201cGlad to help the team out that way, but I thought defensively our group collectively was really good.\u201d\n\nHamonic also played his part to help smother the Kings\u2019 floundering offense. He used his body to break up a pass by Ilya Kovalchuk during an odd-man rush in the second period, when the Kings managed four shots on goal.\n\nHamonic also disrupted a breakaway by Tanner Pearson on the power play in the third period, coming up from behind to delay Pearson from shooting and allowing Rittich to make the save when Pearson did put the puck on goal.\n\n\u201cI think he was the most noticeable guy either way on either team,\u201d Flames coach Bill Peters said of Hamonic. \u201cHe just found a way to be involved in the game.\u201d\n\nThe Kings struggled to create chances on a consistent basis, continuing a recurring theme this season. Even when Jeff Carter won an offensive-zone face-off with 44 seconds remaining and Campbell pulled for an extra attacker, the Kings still could not beat Rittich.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting some shots, but not the shots we want,\u201d Kings forward Alex Iafallo said. \u201cWe need to get that passion back, that hunger to get to the soft areas and keep making plays.\u201d\n\nAfter beating the Anaheim Ducks 4-1 on Tuesday in coach Willie Desjardins\u2019 debut with the team, the Kings have lost two straight and scored one goal each in defeats against the Minnesota Wild and Flames.\n\nDesjardins said the Kings would have to be more aggressive on offense, even if it meant getting away from the sound defensive structure that has been the team\u2019s identity this decade.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s the way they have always won, so I think some of the top guys think a little bit more defensively,\u201d Desjardins said. \u201cThe guys on the other side, (Flames forward Johnny) Gaudreau, (Sean) Monahan, they are always thinking offense. Saying that, I think we have to create some systems that are going to get guys more involved.

(AP) \u2014 It\u2019s a late Monday afternoon and a small tavern on a remote side street in downtown Plymouth is packed.\n\nHundreds of folks are there to celebrate the birthday of arguably the biggest star in town: An 8-year-old Bernese Mountain Dog named Stella.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the township supervisor and Stella\u2019s bigger than me,\u201d Kurt Heise told the Detroit Free Press . \u201cI couldn\u2019t get a crowd like this for my birthday. She\u2019s got a book and a restaurant named after her.\u201d\n\nStella is the namesake for Stella\u2019s Black Dog Tavern, a once-struggling bar that is now a dining destination.\n\nThe man behind Stella\u2019s fame and the tavern\u2019s turnaround is Bob Ostendorf.\n\nHe\u2019s a turnaround specialist who spent about 30 years rescuing companies, including auto suppliers, from financial ruin. Five years ago at age 63, Ostendoft abandoned retirement and bought Doyle\u2019s Tavern. He rebranded it and made it so successful that he plans to move it to a bigger venue in Plymouth before year-end to accommodate its growing popularity.\n\nBut it hasn\u2019t been all triumph for Ostendorf. Along the way, he endured personal tragedies, and it was this 125-pound black dog, Stella, who would ultimately rescue him.\n\nNow they both help others. They raise money for a local humane society and Stella is a certified service dog who visits former war veterans at Veterans Affairs Ann Arbor Healthcare System. She also doles out daily empathy to everyone she meets at the tavern, in some cases changing lives.\n\nHere is the story of a man, his life\u2019s work and the dog who\u2019s touching a town.\n\nBob Ostendorf is a reserved man who\u2019ll shake your hand with genuine warmth. He has an avuncular presence that belies his deep military discipline and financial acumen.\n\nAnd he loves two things: People and dogs. He credits the former for making him a successful businessman. He credits the latter for making him a better man.\n\n\u201cI think God was ingenious when he created dogs,\u201d said Ostendorf. \u201cStella and I spend a lot of time together and we do benevolent things.\u201d\n\nBefore benevolence came business. A 1972 graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy, Ostendorf served in the Navy and earned an MBA from Troy University in Alabama. In 1978, he joined French tire maker Michelin as an engineering manager.\n\nHe learned to speak French and by 1985 he ran daily operations at tire maker Michelin\u2019s manufacturing facility in Dothan, Alabama. While in charge of manufacturing, Ostendorf fostered a team mentality and the plant won supplier quality awards from Ford, General Motors and Chrysler, he said.\n\n\u201cI involved the people in all the decisions and I was very visible on the shop floor,\u201d said Ostendorf. \u201cI pulled the opaque wallpaper off my office windows so that people could look into my office.\u201d\n\nHe learned his management style from his father, who he worked for while growing up in St. Louis. He later honed that style while in the Navy.\n\n\u201cMy father was a construction foreman and a hands-on guy,\u201d Ostendorf said. \u201cIn the Navy, I was mentored by some senior officers who always took care of their people first.\u201d\n\nAt his farewell party in 1988, 2,000 of the 3,000 plant workers showed up, he said.\n\n\u201cA lady composed a song for me,\u201d he said, \u201cand they gave me roses.\u201d\n\nOstendorf left to start what would become a long career rescuing financially distressed companies, many of which were suppliers to the Detroit 3 automakers.\n\nHe found the work rewarding, but in the midst of his success, came deep sorrow. His wife, Judy, was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in the late 1990s. So in 1999, he moved from Novi to take a job at Morgan Corp. in Morgantown, Pennsylvania, about 50 miles west of Philadelphia. He led a turnaround at Morgan, which makes freight truck bodies.\n\n\u201cIt was a hard time, but you go through a lot of stuff at the Naval Academy,\u201d he said, that helped prepare him to manage a demanding career and cope with his wife\u2019s illness. Besides, taking the job was a requisite.\n\n\u201cI needed the money. She was using experimental drugs to fight cancer,\u201d Ostendorf said.\n\nOstendorf said his wife was his \u201cchildhood sweetheart\u201d since age 7. He finds it difficult to talk about her suffering even now, but he finds comfort knowing she received the \u201cbest care in the world\u201d for the three years she fought the disease. She died at age 52 in 2002.\n\nOstendorf pushed on and his job with Morgan brought him back to Sturgis, Michigan, on business calls. Sturgis is about a two-hour drive southwest of Ann Arbor and Ostendorf decided Michigan was his future.\n\n\u201cI bought a home in Plymouth thinking someday I\u2019d relocate here,\u201d said Ostendorf. \u201cI liked the climate and I liked the people and the Midwestern mentality.\u201d\n\nIt would be awhile. Ostendorf spent the next decade working for various private equity firms before retiring in 2010, and finally moving to that house he owned in Plymouth.\n\n\u201cI hadn\u2019t lived there in 10 years, the home had bats in it,\u201d Ostendorf said. \u201cI had to get rid of the bats.\u201d\n\nAs Ostendorf cleared his home of one critter, he decided it was time to get another. Remarried with grown kids, Ostendorf missed his beloved Golden Retriever, Nugget. She was his family\u2019s dog in the 1980s when he worked for Michelin, but she was really his dog.\n\n\u201cShe and I were very close,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen she died at about age 10, I said no more dogs. But in 2010, I was retired and I thought maybe it\u2019s time.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019d read about Bernese mountain dogs, a versatile working dog that originated in Switzerland. The dogs are known to have endearing personalities.\n\nHe found a good breeder in Missouri whose dogs\u2019 bloodlines had longevity, often living to 12 or 13 years old. He saw pictures of a puppy there and fell in love. He paid $600 for the puppy, Stella, and $300 for a person to fly her to Michigan. Thanks to a growing popularity, Bernese mountain dogs today can cost $2,000 or more.\n\nStella and Ostendorf took to each other quickly. She would accompany him just about everywhere, and within a year she\u2019d be his emotional savior.\n\nIn 2011, he and his second wife were divorcing when his parents died within three weeks of each other.\n\nOstendorf, the oldest of four boys, said during that time, \u201cStella was my best friend. Between the death of my parents and the divorce, she was my rock.\u201d\n\nHe buried his mother before his father, and Stella was at the funeral with him, seated under his feet, Ostendorf said.\n\n\u201cShe sleeps against me at night,\u201d Ostendorf said. \u201cShe pretty much understands everything I say to her. She is my buddy.\u201d\n\nHe would often take her with him to a neighborhood pub, Doyle\u2019s Tavern. The staff would prepare a \u201csurf-and-turf\u201d meal for Stella. Ostendorf liked the place and he was bored in retirement. It was in financial straits, so he and a minority partner bought it in 2013.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I did all my life, turnarounds and fixing stuff on timelines,\u201d said Ostendorf. So he improved the food and changed the name to honor his number one pal, Stella.\n\n\u201cWe were initially criticized with people saying, \u2018Who\u2019d name a bar after a dog?\u2019\u201d Ostendorf said.\n\nBut then his customers started meeting Stella.\n\nStella comes to the tavern with him daily. She usually only stays a few hours, but she\u2019s the main attraction. Those who don\u2019t get to see her will come back repeatedly asking to meet Stella. A sign graces the entrance telling patrons if she\u2019s in the house or not that day.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s the draw,\u201d said Ostendorf. \u201cOur food\u2019s good, too, but she\u2019s the draw. People will come in and say \u2018I\u2019ve been here three times and I haven\u2019t seen her yet.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s because she touches lives. Take Chloe Turnham Fleck, who had to quit college due to a severe eating disorder. Fleck read that a service dog could help her, but she didn\u2019t know what kind of breed to get.\n\nAbout a year ago, Fleck wandered into the tavern and met Stella, who is a licensed service dog who regularly visits sick veterans at VA hospitals. That settled it.\n\n\u201cI got Jude,\u201d said Fleck, referring to the 10-month-old female Bernese Mountain Dog donning a service-dog vest, standing at her feet nuzzling with Stella. The two dogs met for the first time at Stella\u2019s birthday bash.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a psychiatric service dog for me. She does pressure therapy, she\u2019s grounding and comforting. She goes everywhere with me except for work,\u201d Fleck said. \u201cToday, we just wanted to stop by and say happy birthday.\u201d\n\nThen, there are the children. Ostendorf wrote a children\u2019s book about Stella, with a second one due out in December. He has Stella dolls adorning the entire restaurant that he gives to children. He said he\u2019s given out at least 2,000 in recent years. But it\u2019s nothing like the real thing.\n\n\u201cWe had a little girl, about 10, in here once. She was in a neck brace,\u201d Ostendorf said. \u201cI gave her a Stella doll and Stella took it over to her and sat with her. Later, her grandparents told me, \u2018That means so much because she just lost her brother and her parents in a car accident.\u2019\u201d\n\nAnother time, Stella approached a woman diner. Stella gently placed her paw on the woman\u2019s hand, then leaned on her affectionately, almost, \u201cholding her up,\u201d Ostendorf said. Later, the woman asked him, \u201cHow does this dog know I\u2019m paralyzed?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s just a very empathetic breed,\u201d Ostendorf said in describing Stella.\n\nWhen Ostendorf takes Stella to the VA hospital in Ann Arbor, he said, staff will announce over the PA system that she is in the building. Soon 50 to 60 veterans, most suffering from chronic illnesses, will come out of their rooms to see her. Some are in wheelchairs having lost a leg to diabetes, Ostendorf said.\n\n\u201cShe goes right up to them, puts her head on the wheelchair and looks up at them, not looking at their amputation,\u201d he said.\n\nStella, who recently had an ACL injury and subsequent surgery, had to suspend her VA hospital visits for a while, but is resuming them.\n\nWalking through the tavern on the day of Stella\u2019s yearly birthday party, her star power is palpable. Wrapped birthday gifts sit on many tables and two men carefully maneuver a full sheet cake (donated by a Stella admirer) through the standing-room only crowd. Each year, the party raises about $2,500 in donations for the Huron Valley Humane Society. Whatever amount customers donate, Ostendorf matches. In total, Ostendorf estimates her birthday parties over the years have raised $15,000 for the Huron Valley Humane Society.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll feel a lot of love here,\u201d said Pamm Bakley, a regular customer whose 8-by-10 inch framed photo of her Chihuahua, Angel, hangs on the wall amid hundreds of other 8-by-10 inch photos of customers\u2019 pooches. \u201cThat\u2019s what Stella\u2019s is, a lot of love.\u201d\n\nCustomer Debbie Kinast, who\u2019s lived in Plymouth six years, comes to Stella\u2019s several times a month and said, \u201cWe always look for Stella when we come here. She\u2019s a mascot for Plymouth. Everyone knows Stella.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s fair to say that Stella is more beloved in Plymouth than Santa Claus himself.\n\nThe first week of December each year, Plymouth opens the holiday season with Santa Claus riding the town\u2019s firetruck into downtown Plymouth to be given the key to the city.\n\nLast year, Stella rode on the truck with Santa. Ostendorf took the stage to enthusiastic applause. But when Stella took the stage after him, the kids \u201cwent crazy,\u201d Ostendorf and customers said. She will ride with Santa again this year.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s kind of iconic. She walks down the street and she\u2019s well known,\u201d Ostendorf said. \u201cIt\u2019s part of giving back. I saved a lot of jobs in private equity, but there\u2019s a tough side to that too and you really don\u2019t get to enjoy it.\u201d\n\nOstendorf\u2019s grueling years rescuing troubled businesses were spent on airplanes and analyzing numbers, he said.\n\n\u201cThis is a little more soft side,\u201d he said. \u201cStella is making a difference. Now my work\u2019s not so much financially driven, it\u2019s more esoteric and more benevolent.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Detroit Free Press, http://www.freep.com", "TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. (AP) \u2014 The blue-brick walls, simple bunks and warm dinners are aren\u2019t home \u2014 but they\u2019re a welcome shelter from a frigid November night.\n\nThe Safe Harbor Homeless Shelter in Traverse City recently opened its doors to 26 guests as temperatures cooled and winter neared.\n\nSeveral days of rain and snow are expected soon, and nights may dip as cold as 29 degrees.\n\n\u201cAs it gets colder, more and more people come in,\u201d Safe Harbor Board Chair Mike McDonald told the Traverse City Record-Eagle . \u201cMost of our guests sleep in their cars or out in the woods in the summertime. They come in when that becomes unfeasible.\u201d\n\nSafe Harbor, in its 15th season, opens November through April to provide temporary shelter.\n\nIts second goal \u2014 an important one, McDonald said \u2014 is connecting guests with help to find more permanent living conditions.\n\nLast year, about 40 northern Michigan homeless people found a new home through Safe Harbor. In 2016, that number was about 50.\n\nThe shelter averages about 57 guests a night and runs almost entirely on volunteers, with a little help from Goodwill Industries. Most return each season.\n\n\u201cThey get involved, they see the need,\u201d said Sandra McDonald, Mike McDonald\u2019s wife and a longtime shelter volunteer. \u201cThey come back to help.\u201d\n\nVolunteers clean the shelter spaces, prepare meals, brew coffee and simply sit and talk with guests to keep them feeling welcome, she said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re like any other people \u2014 some are shy, some are very outgoing. Some are withdrawn, some want to interact,\u201d Sandra McDonald said. \u201cOnce people come in here and work, I think they see that these are our neighbors in need of some extra help.\u201d\n\nFront offices of the Safe Harbor shelter stay open through the day, and homeless people are welcome to stop in to meet with coordinators for housing programs and other services.\n\nGoodwill is a major part of that \u2014 the nonprofit both supplies staff to help keep the Safe Harbor shelter running, and coordinators for more permanent solutions.\n\n\u201cWe help people get to the right resources at the right time,\u201d said Ryan Hannon, Goodwill Street Outreach Coordinator.\n\nIt\u2019s an important effort.\n\n\u201cHomelessness is really bad for your health \u2014 people are in survival mode,\u201d Hannon said. \u201cShelters provide safety, not only from the weather, but from people who would do bad things to people experiencing homelessness.\u201d\n\nFor its second year, Safe Harbor operates in a new facility on Wellington Street.\n\nThe new, permanent shelter space offers 82 beds \u2014 up from 72 last year \u2014 a warm evening meal and hot showers. The space also boasts an entertainment room, Wi-Fi and public computers, a laundry room and an optional bible study space for anyone interested in attending.\n\nGuests sign in between 6 p.m. and 7 p.m. each evening, and after having bags checked for weapons, alcohol and drugs, are assigned a bunk, blanket, locker and storage tub.\n\nLights out comes at 11 p.m. and guests must leave by 8 a.m. the next morning, after coffee and a light breakfast.\n\nA dedicated space makes things easier, Mike McDonald said. Before the shelter\u2019s opening, Safe Harbor operated in local churches, rotating from place to place throughout the winter season.\n\nThe program began in 2003 through the Church of Nazarene, which started opening its doors to the homeless on particularly cold nights after a homeless man drowned in the icy Kids Creek. The word spread and the program grew quickly.\n\n\u201cWe had a really busy year where we\u2019d have over 50,\u201d Mike McDonald said. \u201cThat\u2019s when we came to realize that housing them in the churches wasn\u2019t going to work long-term.\u201d\n\nThe permanent shelter opened last November \u2014 a project several years in the works. The McDonalds worked with city officials to make the construction possible and spent several months renovating after purchasing the space just off Eighth Street.\n\nLocal churches \u2014 23 in total \u2014 continue to help by coordinating volunteers and hosting evening meals at the shelter. West Side Community Church volunteers prepped and served a recent evening\u2019s grilled cheese sandwiches, soup and sides.\n\nCommunity volunteers are just as welcome \u2014 139 shifts need to be filled at Safe Harbor each week. About 95 percent of volunteers come back, the McDonalds said.\n\n\u201cPeople go away feeling that they\u2019ve helped people, they\u2019ve changed people\u2019s lives,\u201d Sandra McDonald said. \u201cYou get so much out of it.\u201d\n\nMike McDonald expects more guests as the weather cools \u2014 and with that, more volunteers are only a boon.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll probably see it grow this week \u2014 it\u2019s going to start raining at night,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Traverse City Record-Eagle, http://www.record-eagle.com", "COLUMBUS, Miss. (AP) \u2014 Last month, Andre Rush was in Belgium accepting a peace award.\n\nOn Nov. 1, he was sitting outside Helen\u2019s Kitchen in Columbus, musing with his old classmate Kabir Karriem about life at Lee High School, where they both were members of the last graduating class in 1992. Both played football \u2014 the aptly named Rush was a running back and Karriem played on the defensive line. They also took a class together called industrial art, but neither could remember \u201cwhat that class was even about.\u201d\n\n\u201cI remember he got in trouble a lot,\u201d Rush said of Karriem.\n\nThen Rush crossed his arms \u2014 each sporting a 24-inch bicep \u2014 and leaned back in his chair.\n\n\u201cThe main thing I want people to understand is you can do anything,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if you\u2019re just a guy from Columbus, Mississippi.\u201d\n\nRush ought to know. In a 24-year Army career, he built a resume fit for a Hollywood movie.\n\nHe was inside the Pentagon on Sept. 11, 2001, when a terrorist flew a plane into part of the building. He was later wounded in combat in Iraq. Since then, he has become a staunch advocate for suicide prevention, especially among returning soldiers suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nHe\u2019s an avid student of kinesiology, a personal trainer and a master ice carver.\n\nOh, and Rush, a chef, has prepared meals for the U.S. president and dignitaries at the White House for the last four administrations.\n\nEven so, Rush didn\u2019t become certifiably famous until this summer, when a photo a reporter took of him preparing a Ramadan meal for President Donald Trump hit social media and went viral. Rush\u2019s arms caught everyone\u2019s attention, and suddenly the \u201cjacked chef\u201d was in high demand.\n\n\u201cI get a lot of folks contacting me on social media about how I got my arms to look like this,\u201d Rush said. \u201cBut now I also get parents reaching out to me about their kids wanting to be chefs.\u201d\n\nNow, Rush is writing an autobiography and cookbook, expected to be published next year. He\u2019s even poised to star in a new television show titled \u201cChef in the City,\u201d in which he intends to revisit his roots.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to find a way to incorporate Columbus into one of the episodes,\u201d he said.\n\nFrom cook to chef\n\nRush\u2019s journey to the White House kitchen started in his own.\n\nThe youngest of eight children, Rush often helped his mother prepare meals for their large family.\n\n\u201cMy mom was my foundation,\u201d he said. \u201cThe most connected you could feel with your family growing up was sitting around the table for meals. I loved that feeling.\u201d\n\nAfter Rush joined the Army in 1993, he found himself in the kitchen again as a cook. He was so good at it he landed a job three years later at the Pentagon cooking for the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\nBy 1997, he was recommended to join the White House cooking staff, and he spent several years doing both jobs part-time.\n\n\u201cTo even be considered for that job, you have to have a Top Secret security clearance and several recommendations from the right people,\u201d Rush said. \u201cOnce you get in the door, you have to work your butt off. You have to prove yourself in a place where everyone else already has.\u201d\n\nAnd he did, first for Bill Clinton, then George W. Bush, Barack Obama and now Trump.\n\nThat\u2019s two Democratic and two Republican administrations in a city where politics is a blood sport. Politics, though, have little place in the kitchen.\n\n\u201cThey know who you voted for and whether you voted for them. They find that out,\u201d Rush said of the presidents. \u201cBut if you\u2019re good at your job, none of that matters.\u201d\n\nIn the White House\n\nUp until about two months ago, Rush worked at the White House two to three days a week.\n\nThose days started about 6 a.m. and often ended at 11 p.m. The work, although rewarding, is meticulous and sometimes grueling.\n\n\u201cThe cooking is the easy part,\u201d he said. \u201cLogistics are the hard part.\u201d\n\nFirst, the kitchen is quite small, contrary to what people may believe of the grandiose White House. Then there\u2019s months, if not a year\u2019s worth, of preparation for specific events.\n\nDepending on the dignitaries visiting, or the nature of the occasion, dietary or religious restrictions must be considered. Then there\u2019s presentation, possibly the most tedious and time-consuming element, especially if the dining party is large.\n\nOn the more personal side, dealing successfully with the presidents involves learning what they like and only giving advice \u2014 such as health and nutritional \u2014 when asked.\n\n\u201cThey like everything I cook,\u201d Rush said, laughing. \u201cI\u2019m a pretty humble guy, but I cook extremely well. I also cook to each president\u2019s palate, and every one of them is different.\u201d\n\nHe said Trump\u2019s palate was the simplest of the four presidents he\u2019s served, which he found surprising for the magnate who has eaten all over the world. Obama\u2019s and Clinton\u2019s, on the other hand, were the most \u201copen palates,\u201d which allowed Rush to be more creative and experiment with more dishes.\n\nPresident Bush, he said, liked barbeque and famously banned broccoli from the White House and Air Force One.\n\nWhen asked, Rush always jokes that every president likes chicken. He admits, though, that observation doesn\u2019t reveal very much.\n\n\u201cEverybody likes chicken, and I can make chicken a million ways,\u201d he said.\n\nMilitary service\n\nRush doesn\u2019t talk much about his military service. Not the specifics, anyway.\n\nHe\u2019ll tell you he was wounded in Iraq while part of a security detail, but that story pretty much ends there. He\u2019ll share that he was on recovery detail at the Pentagon after the 9/11 attacks, where he lost several of his buddies he had been training in the gym while he was a chef there \u2014 the \u201cwake-up call\u201d that inspired him to volunteer for overseas combat.\n\nBut as it relates to his PTSD, he\u2019s a bit more open as he seeks to support those who also suffer from it.\n\nAs part of Mission 22, which raises awareness for the average of 22 U.S. veterans who take their own lives each day, Rush does 2,222 push-ups each day. He also uses his growing social media influence to raise awareness for veterans\u2019 causes, and runs a program called Cooking to Cope centered on helping soldiers with PTSD by teaching them how to cook with their families.\n\nFor Rush\u2019s own coping, 9/11 has maybe been the hardest obstacle to overcome. Each year, the day drove him into seclusion as he remembered what he experienced and the friends he lost.\n\nThis year, though \u2014 for the first time since the terrorist attacks \u2014 Rush spent Sept. 11 in the public, working with the USO Warrior and Family Center at Fort Belvoir, Virginia.\n\n\u201cIt still haunts me,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this year, I just got out doing my advocacy.\u201d\n\nA hometown hero\n\nKarriem kept up with his classmate on social media in recent years, and after Rush\u2019s bicep photo went viral, he asked Rush to visit Columbus for the 30th anniversary of Helen\u2019s Kitchen \u2014 the northside restaurant Karriem runs with his brother, Kamal, and their mother, Helen.\n\nRush obliged, also graciously fielding the interviews with local media Karriem set up to mark the occasion.\n\nNow a state representative, Karriem remembers Rush as a scrawny youngster with a penchant for lifting well above his weight in the gym.\n\n\u201cHe probably didn\u2019t weigh a buck-fifty, but he could lift 300 or 400 pounds,\u201d Karriem said.\n\nRush is a mountain of a man today, both in physical stature and in the reputation he has built on a national scale.\n\nThat kind of role model, Karriem said, is something he hopes gets the attention of every young person living in Columbus.\n\n\u201cAny time someone from Columbus makes it to that status, it\u2019s awesome,\u201d Karriem said of Rush. \u201cTo see him accomplish what he has, I\u2019m so proud of him. We all should be.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Commercial Dispatch, http://www.cdispatch.com", "LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) \u2014 Down a hallway lined with Lincoln High School\u2019s signature red lockers, through the doors of Room 123, teachers can find a little early-morning salvation: a caffeine oasis open for business each Friday morning.\n\nMore likely than not, Quar-tus Jones will be there, the high school junior with his black apron on, ready to serve the steady stream of customers coming through the doors for a cup of Joe.\n\nOften, it\u2019s actually Joe coming through the doors, and Quar-tus and classmates who make this joint run know exactly how Mr. Pahr likes his coffee.\n\nYou like your coffee black, the students will say.\n\nYes black, he\u2019ll reply. Nothing in it.\n\nAnd the fact that Mr. Pahr, who teaches in the International Baccalaureate program at the other end of the building, knows many of these students by name, that they exchange pleasantries in the hallway, says much about what\u2019s happening in Room 123.\n\nWhat\u2019s happening, for two periods each Friday morning, is Common Grounds, a coffee shop for Lincoln High staff run by students learning job skills.\n\nQuar-tus, who\u2019s interested in basketball and loves Michael Jackson and the R&B group New Edition, also loves selling coffee.\n\n\u201cIt is pretty fun,\u201d he said.\n\nHis counselor, Becky Tegeler, asked him last year if he\u2019d be interested because she\u2019d come up with an idea and was determined to make it happen.\n\nThe counselor, who works with special education students, wanted to broaden the job-skills experience students with intellectual and developmental disabilities got at Lincoln High, the Lincoln Journal Star reported.\n\nExisting classes teach the skills well, Tegeler said, but they nearly always involve the same group of kids and the same teachers.\n\n\u201cI wanted to expand their circle so more people know them, and they could work with people they\u2019re not familiar with,\u201d Tegeler said.\n\nHer inspiration was a story she\u2019d read about a couple in North Carolina who opened a coffee shop run by people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.\n\nShe called Tamara and Dan Sloan, who own Lincoln\u2019s longtime business The Mill, which recently opened a store near the school.\n\nTegeler asked if maybe they\u2019d be willing to donate some Keurig cups.\n\nTamara Sloan had other ideas.\n\nShe\u2019d reached out to Lincoln High before they opened the newest store, and wanted to be a good neighbor. They\u2019ve contributed to sporting events and gotten to know the students and teachers who stop by for coffee \u2014 and they were all in.\n\n\u201cThe Mill\u2019s willingness to participate is huge,\u201d Tegeler said.\n\nBeginning last semester, they donated coffee \u2014 the freshly brewed stuff \u2014 and Common Grounds began as a coffee cart.\n\nTegeler and vocational job skills teacher CJ Brison set up a system on Google Classroom so teachers could put in orders for coffee and students delivered the coffee to their classrooms.\n\nTeachers loved it \u2014 and it got so busy they started asking if they could just stop by for a cup.\n\nSo this semester, they can \u2014 and they do, a constant stream of teachers and administrators and the school resource officer coming into the room with the Common Grounds sign, red and white polka dot tablecloths and two flavors of coffee in 85-cup containers. They\u2019ve recently added hot chocolate and tea.\n\nThe coffee shop is part of a class, which means the rest of the week students spend time practicing the skills they\u2019ll put into practice on Friday: greeting their customers, asking what they\u2019d like, pouring the coffee, measuring the coca and the water, taking money, making change, saying thank you.\n\nTeachers can still order online and have their coffee delivered, and sometimes they call in an order.\n\nSenior Karen Ballardo sold coffee last year and is back this year to help her fellow students, walking with them to deliver orders, reminding them to greet their customers, to say thank you.\n\nBrison and Tegeler tailor the class to standards the district requires they teach, but it\u2019s all about the coffee shop.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always had vocational job opportunities but we created the class specifically for this,\u201d Brison said, and learning social skills is a big part of the experience.\n\n\u201cHaving a face-to-face conversation, talking to students and staff is a good experience for them.\u201d\n\nThe class teaches the importance of good hygiene in a job setting, how you might not always get to do the job you want \u2014 which is why all the students take a turn at each task required to run a coffee shop.\n\nThe $1 they charge for coffee goes back into the class for supplies \u2014 the tablecloths, carts, drink carriers and aprons.\n\nTegeler said they\u2019ve been intentionally buying aprons that are easy to put on to minimize sensory sensitivities some students have, and making sure there are pockets in front for the money.\n\nBrison and Tegeler are there each Friday, along with at least four para-educators to support the students \u2014 and often Tegeler\u2019s recently retired dad, who volunteers.\n\nEach Thursday, Quar-tus calls The Mill to find out what coffee flavors they\u2019ll have that week. The students take inventory, practice saying the names, print out the online orders and set up an assembly line with room number cards marking each order. The regulars have their room number laminated.\n\nLast year at the end of school, the students made a banner and went to The Mill to say thanks. They had lots of questions and the folks at The Mill had T-shirts for them.\n\nSloan is working with Tegeler and Brison to expand the program so that some students can get their food handler permits and volunteer at The Mill near their school.\n\n\u201cNow we can expand our circle to the community,\u201d Tegeler said.\n\nThey\u2019ve got lots of ideas and dreams: making the coffee shop an all-day affair, expanding to serve students, maybe adding food.\n\nMany of the students who take the class will go on to the district\u2019s VOICE program, a job training program for students 18 to 21 years old.\n\nBut unemployment rates are high for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, Tegeler said, and helping students with skills that could help them get meaningful work after graduation is important. Too often they end up doing menial tasks for little money, she said.\n\nQuar-tus, for his part, likes his job in Room 123 and it\u2019s taught him a lot, including a couple of really good things.\n\nServing the coffee is one, but just as important is the second thing.\n\n\u201cAnd making people happy.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Lincoln Journal Star, http://www.journalstar.com", "HUNTSVILLE, Ala. (AP) \u2014 Toybox Bistro is one of the most fun places to eat in Alabama. True to its name, the restaurant celebrates what everyone loves about childhood: playing with toys. Everywhere you look, you see trading cards under the glass table tops, Pez dispensers lined up on shelves, buckets of Legos to play with while you wait for your food to arrive.\n\nAnd adults love it just as much or more than the kids do.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no demographic to our customers,\u201d says co-owner Michelle Timon. She sees a mix of \u201cnerds,\u201d families and, inexplicably, she says, older folks. \u201cAnyone can find something they identify with.\u201d\n\nEvery inch of space is taken up by games, superheroes, robots, dinosaurs and much more \u2014 all collected by Michelle\u2019s late husband, Steve. The two of them were high school sweethearts in central Florida. After they married, she helped put him through engineering school. He started collecting Star Wars and Transformers memorabilia, \u201canything that caught his eye,\u201d she says.\n\nEventually, he had amassed 10,000 pieces in his collection when he died of cancer eight years ago. Just a fraction of the total \u2014 approximately 500 items \u2014 decorate the Toybox Bistro, which opened two-and-a-half years ago. She has so much stuff that she can occasionally change things out.\n\nWhen their son, Andrew Hill, now 29 and living in Pelham, saw the restaurant for the first time, he told her that he remembered being with his dad when he bought about 80 percent of the items on display.\n\nMichelle started out her career as a professional photographer. She then earned a master\u2019s degree in psychology at age 34 and worked as a mental health counselor until about 10 years ago, when her husband was diagnosed with cancer. She became his caregiver.\n\nMeanwhile, her son and his friends were huge fans of anime, a Japanese style of TV and film animation. They convinced her to attend a convention as a vendor, selling collectibles, and was pleasantly surprised by how much money she made. A few years later, in 2009, she and her son\u2019s friends decided to start their own anime convention, Hamacon, short for Huntsville and Madison Anime Convention.\n\nThe first Hamacon took place in 2010, with 300 people attending. Held in June every year since, this past summer the convention drew 3,300 attendees. In addition to the three-day June event at the Von Braun Center, there\u2019s also a single-day \u201cminicon\u201d event every November, on Nov. 10. this year. She estimates that the convention has a $2 million annual impact on Huntsville.\n\nHamacon gave Michelle \u201can amazing surrogate family\u201d during a sad time in her life, she says \u2014 her husband died the same year the first convention was held. As chair of the event, she describes herself as something of a \u201ccat-herder\u201d who depends on about 140 volunteers working to make the event go smoothly. \u201cIt\u2019s a really cool community,\u201d she says.\n\nA few years ago, she decided she \u201cwanted a new challenge\u201d in life. She thought it would be fun to take some of her husband\u2019s collection and start a restaurant with nerdiness as its focal point. And what better place to do it than the home of the U.S. Space and Rocket Center? \u201cHuntsville is the land of nerd-dom,\u201d she says fondly. \u201cEveryone has a connection to high-tech industry here. They\u2019re proud of being nerdy and geeky.\u201d\n\nShe knew the perfect business partner would be Bill Bridgmon, her best friend since high school. Bill, who was living in New Hampshire at the time, was a trained chef who had worked in restaurants all his life. \u201cHe\u2019s a force of nature,\u201d she says of Bill. \u201cBrilliant, quick-witted, crazy, always on.\u201d\n\nAt first, Bill told her, \u201cHell no. You\u2019re not the right kind of crazy to run a restaurant.\u201d But Michelle wore him down. Finally, he told her she might be on to something. Maybe she was just the right kind of crazy.\n\nThey found the perfect central location for the Toybox, in \u201ca strange little janky building\u201d that\u2019s still owned by Stan Steadman, the son of the original owner who bought the corner spot in 1945. \u201cThere\u2019s been a restaurant on that corner for 70 years,\u201d says Michelle. \u201cIn the 1960s, Wernher von Braun ate breakfast here.\u201d\n\nToybox Bistro opened in March of 2016 and has been going strong ever since. Michelle and Bill are pretty much always there, putting in 80 to 90 hours a week \u2014 but it\u2019s a labor of love. \u201cI turned my life upside-down,\u201d she says of the decision to open the restaurant.\n\nHer late husband\u2019s collection makes the decor interesting and brings customers in the door, but it\u2019s the kitchen\u2019s creations that keep them coming back, she says. Many of the menu items are big and over-the-top, like half-pound, all-beef hot dogs, a \u201cHuntsvegas\u201d hot chicken sandwich with Carolina mustard sauce, chicken-and-waffle sliders and \u201csome of the best burgers in town.\u201d\n\nIn both of her endeavors \u2014 Hamacon and the Toybox \u2014 Michelle has found faithful, loyal people who take the success of the convention and the restaurant personally. At the restaurant, the kitchen staff offers two daily specials that aren\u2019t on the menu. Giving them freedom to create new items \u201cgives them ownership in who the Toybox is,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve got people here who have been here since the day we opened. They\u2019re like family to us.\u201d\n\nThe restaurant is always hosting events, from an all-you-can-eat wings night once a month to \u201ctin foil hat night,\u201d where every customer sported a hat fashioned from aluminum foil in honor of the solar eclipse last August.\n\n\u201cThe coolest thing about owning your own place is making your own rules,\u201d Michelle says.\n\nSurely, Steve would be proud of the way his wife reinvented herself in his absence. \u201cMy husband was a big nerd,\u201d she says. \u201cHe would have loved Toybox. It speaks to everyone\u2019s inner nerd.\u201d\n\nSurrounded by his collection that represents all things nerdy, in the heart of a nerdy town, Michelle fits right in. \u201cI\u2019m kind of a nerd, too.\u201d", "SHEBOYGAN, Wis.

The trail separates the state park from scattered wetlands, crucial for amphibian nesting, on property owned by Kohler Co.\n\nAccording to the Wisconsin Wetlands Association, statewide there are just 10 such sites, all of them small, which contain both interdunal and ridge-swale wetlands.\n\nTrochlell has surveyed the Kohler property three times as an ecologist for the DNR, most recently after the company proposed building a public 18-hole golf course on a 247-acre site adjacent to the state park.\n\nHer impression: \u201cI was thinking this is one of the most special places I have ever been.\u201d\n\nDNR\u2019s final environmental impact statement for the project from January states that of the 5 acres of \u201cvery rare\u201d and \u201cimperiled\u201d Great Lakes Ridge and Swale wetlands on the Kohler site, about 1.5 acres would be filled to build the golf course and others will experience \u201csecondary impacts.\u201d\n\nTrochlell said the DNR completed its environmental assessment before seeing detailed plans from Kohler \u2014 backward of the normal process. She assumed Kohler\u2019s request for a wetland permit, required to build the golf course, would never be granted. She was wrong.\n\nThe agency approved the permit for the project, which would also require removal of up to 120 acres of forest. Trochlell believes the loss of trees, installation of fertilized turf and other changes would negatively affect the area\u2019s dunes and wetlands.\n\nTrochlell determined the project did not meet state standards. But she said her bosses told her the permit should be approved no matter what.\n\n\u201cI was in a meeting with managers . and I asked the question of what would happen if we wouldn\u2019t sign off on these permits, and I was told that if we didn\u2019t sign off on these permits, we would be . moved to another job or fired, I think that\u2019s how I interpreted it,\u201d Trochlell recalled.\n\nGov. Scott Walker\u2019s office directed questions about the Kohler project to the DNR. The department declined a request for an interview, citing ongoing litigation, which has stalled the project. DNR spokesman Jim Dick said the agency \u201cmakes permit application decisions based on law and sound science.\u201d\n\nJim Buchholz, who worked for the DNR for more than 36 years, including 28 years as Kohler-Andrae\u2019s park superintendent, said in testimony in June that the approval allows \u201cdestruction of rare, globally significant wetland areas\u201d and \u201cdoes not follow the agency\u2019s own wetland preservation standards.\u201d\n\nKohler Co. is known for its bathroom fixtures, golf courses and the five-star American Club in the village of Kohler. In the 1930s, the company purchased 468 acres of land along Lake Michigan in Sheboygan County, and donated nearly half to what is now the Kohler-Andrae State Park. The rest of the land is now slated to be a golf course.\n\nThe facility will include an irrigation pond, golf cart paths, a clubhouse of up to 16,000 square feet, a 22,000-square-foot maintenance building and an entry road.\n\n\u201cWe remain committed to implementing a plan that will avoid, minimize and mitigate potential impacts from the public golf course,\u201d Dirk Willis, Kohler\u2019s group director of golf, said in a statement.\n\nThe company promises to remediate destroyed wetlands through programs that allow it to sponsor the restoration or creation of wetlands elsewhere.\n\nIn addition, \u201cAll Lake Michigan near shore wetland resources are being avoided, including interdunal wetlands,\u201d the company said in its 2017 permit application.\n\nKohler hopes the project will become one of the world\u2019s top golf courses. A consultant hired by Kohler projects the course would bring nearly $21 million a year in economic activity to Sheboygan County, create 227 permanent jobs and generate $1.1 million in annual tax revenue.\n\nTo pave the way for the project, the Wisconsin Natural Resources Board approved a swap of 4.6 acres of state parkland and a nearly 2-acre easement for 9.5 acres of Kohler property with a house and several storage buildings.\n\nAs Buchholz walks through the park he ran for nearly three decades, through sandy dunes and old growth forest, he points out the land to be traded to Kohler. He believes the swap of state park land creates a bad precedent.\n\nIn the past, \u201cNobody would ever have considered giving that land away, but times have changed,\u201d he said. \u201cThings have changed politically. Things have changed a lot.\u201d\n\nTrochlell believes that under the Kohler Co. plan, the rare wetlands will become overrun by invasive species, and standing water will be polluted by the nutrients from fertilizer.\n\n\u201cOur whole ecosystem is based upon having species that interact with each other. When you lose one part of that, we don\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to affect all the other parts,\u201d she said.\n\nAn archaeological study of the Kohler Co. property found over 25,000 historic and prehistoric artifacts, including stone tools and ceramics dating back more than 3,000 years. In addition, a group of Native American burial mounds exists on the site; Kohler says they will not be disturbed.\n\nLawsuits filed against the DNR by the environmental nonprofit, Friends of the Black River Forest, have challenged both the granting of the wetland permit and the swap of state land.\n\nAccording to the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign database, top Kohler employees have donated $43,500 to Walker\u2019s campaigns since 2009. The Kohler family, including chairman Herbert V. Kohler Jr., is worth $6.8 billion, according to Forbes.\n\nTo DNR veterans, businesses seeking influence with Wisconsin\u2019s environmental agency is not new. What has changed, they say, is how the department responds.\n\n\u201cWhat DNR is doing is behind closed doors, rewriting the law but directing staff to ignore what the standards are and issue permits that are contrary to those standards,\u201d said George Meyer, who served as DNR secretary from 1993 to 2001 under two Republican governors and now leads the Wisconsin Wildlife Federation.\n\nHe said that the Kohler decision sends \u201ca signal to staff that . their decision could be overridden at any time depending on who the applicant is and what kind of political connections they have.\u201d\n\nAs an attorney working on surface water and wetland issues for the DNR for 34 years, Michael Cain was behind the adoption of some of the most stringent wetland laws in the country. In recent years, the state Legislature has reduced some of those protections.\n\nCain, who retired in 2010, said during his time at the department, staff were supported in enforcing the law even in the face of pressure from politicians and \u201cpeople with money.\u201d\n\nSaid Cain: \u201cI had the capacity to walk down the hall to the secretary\u2019s office and knock on the door and sit down and say \u2018This is what we need to do to comply with the law,\u2019 and I was never told, \u2018We can\u2019t do that, we won\u2019t do that.\u2019\u201d\n\nAt the Charcoal Inn South in Sheboygan, while some customers did not want to talk about the project, 37-year-old cook Steven Lilyquist weighed in.\n\n\u201cHonestly, I\u2019m not really particularly for or against it. I mean, golf is a great thing. It\u2019s a great sport,\u201d Lilyquist said. \u201cAs long as we\u2019re not endangering a bunch of animals and everything, I say go for it.\u201d\n\nA drive through the village of Kohler, past the design showroom of bathroom fixtures, past the Kohler Waters Spa and the American Club hotel, offers glimpses into a well-manicured community. At the Woodlake Market grocery store near the center of town, a group of Kohler Co. landscaping employees stops to pick up snacks during a break.\n\nRandy Demaster, a seasonal landscaper for Kohler who has helped to build several other Kohler golf courses, believes most people in the area support the project, in part because of the tax revenue it would bring in. And he expects the course to have little to no negative environmental impacts.\n\n\u201cThey (Kohler) are very concerned and conscientious about the environment,\u201d Demaster said. \u201cThat\u2019s why they are trying to keep everything in place as much as possible and work around it.\u201d\n\nA few times a week, Mary Faydash walks along the beach south from her home in the town of Wilson through Kohler-Andrae to visit the shore and the forest of birch trees interspersed with evergreens where she sees foxes running and bald eagles flying.\n\n\u201cTo me and to many people in Wilson, it\u2019s a sacred place,\u201d the retired teacher said.\n\nOver the past four years, Faydash has become self-taught in the ecology of the landscape, the details of Kohler\u2019s application and what she sees as the politics of its approval.\n\nFaydash organized opposition to the project through her group, Friends of the Black River Forest, named after the nearby river. Administrative and court challenges in Dane and Sheboygan counties to the wetland permit, the environmental impact statement and the land swap have halted the project for now.\n\nSaid Faydash: \u201cA billionaire feels that they can run roughshod over not only our rights, but our health. I don\u2019t think . you can destroy an ecosystem which is very rare because you can afford to.\u201d", "GULFPORT, Miss. (AP) \u2014 Imagine swallowing a hook with a large weight attached to it.\n\nImagine spending months with that hook inside you while you try to carry on with your life.\n\nThat happens to sea turtles on a regular basis when they take a fisherman\u2019s bait.\n\nLucky for them, there is someone here to help.\n\nLocated on the industrial Canal in Gulfport, the Institute For Marine Mammal Studies has been a leading force in helping save the critically endangered Kemp\u2019s ridley sea turtle.\n\nSince the 2010 BP oil spill, they have rescued over 1,000 of the turtles, returning 98 percent of them to the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nIronically, those turtles that have been caught by accident help keep local fishing piers open while contributing to the study of the species.\n\nCo-operation of local fishermen is critical to their success.\n\nFederal law limits the number of protected sea turtles that can be caught off of any given pier. When IMMS is able to rehabilitate and return an accidentally caught turtle, it takes that catch off the pier\u2019s list, allowing it to stay open.\n\nSigns posted on piers give instructions and a hotline number to call if you accidentally catch a sea turtle.\n\nIf a member of the IMMS staff isn\u2019t available, local fire departments are trained to collect the animals and keep them until they can be treated at the IMMS veterinary hospital.\n\nGetting animals that are fairly healthy allows them to learn about their biology and behavior, said Mysteria Samuelson, behavior ecologist and stranding coordinator for IMMS.\n\n\u201cThat helps formulate a practical plan for the conservation of the species,\u201d she said.\n\nDebra Moore, a veterinarian from Mississippi State University, has worked with IMMS for the last year in a five-year project funded by money from the BP oil spill settlement. The $6.5 million grant pays for work to help both stranded dolphins and turtles. The money is awarded through a National Fish and Wildlife Foundation grant through the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality.\n\nMoore said they have gathered information from 629 healthy Kemp\u2019s ridley turtles that, for the first time, has given scientists a baseline of knowledge.\n\n\u201cWe (now) know what normal looks like,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cEvery time we get an opportunity to do all the diagnostic work with these guys, we\u2019re learning more and more about them.\u201d\n\nStill their work is \u201cin its first stages\u201d\n\n\u201cPrior to the oil spill there was very little knowledge on what made these animals tick,\u201d said Moby Solangi, director of IMMS. \u201cUntil we started this work, nobody thought the Mississippi Sound was a critical habitat.\u201d\n\nThey now know that after turtles that survive after being born on a beach in Mexico spend their juvenile years in the northern Gulf of Mexico.\n\nKnowledge about species like the Kemp\u2019s ridley gives scientists an insight into the overall health of the Gulf of Mexico. Study of the gulf has greatly increased since the oil spill, but much is still not known.\n\nRecovery of the species is very integral to maintaining a healthy ecosystem, said stranding technician Erin Mattson.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to make sure that we give them the best chance for survival.\u201d\n\nTypically, when a fisherman calls the stranding hotline, a team from IMMS will come collect the animal. They will examine it, including blood samples and x-rays. They will remove any hooks or other foreign objects and devise a rehabilitation plan.\n\nTurtles may stay anywhere from a month to a year before they are healthy enough to return to the Gulf.\n\nPublic education is a big part of their program, so they like to invite the public whenever they release turtles.\n\nOn Nov. 3, about 300 people watched as eight of the turtles were released in Pass Christian.\n\nChildren, adults and the IMMS staff reveled in the event.\n\n\u201cEver since I was a little kid I\u2019ve always wanted to work with sea turtles,\u201d said Erin Fitzpatrick-Wacker, a veterinary technician for IMMS. It is \u201cextremely rewarding\u201d to take care of a sick Kemp\u2019s ridley and then release them.\n\n\u201cJust seeing that turtle get really excited when you put them back in the ocean is super rewarding,\u201d she said. \u201cI love being a part of that.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Sun Herald, http://www.sunherald.com", "HARTSELLE, Ala. (AP) \u2014 Downtown Hartselle is going through its most significant transformation in more than two decades, with changes that include a restaurant expanding its seating capacity from 30 to 240 and the opening of a brick-oven pizzeria that will serve homemade Italian food.\n\nIt\u2019s a shift from plans in the early 1980s when the goal was to turn Hartselle into the best antique district in the South, city officials said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember a time when businesses in downtown were this diverse,\u201d said Mayor Randy Garrison, who grew up in Hartselle.\n\nHe said Pizza Ed is opening by year\u2019s end and the move by Bentley\u2019s at The Outhouse to a bigger building at the corner of Main and Sparkman streets will fill a void that has existed in the business community for years.\n\nBoth restaurants have alcohol licenses and will be open \u201cinto the night hours\u201d in downtown, but they are not nightclubs, the mayor said.\n\n\u201cThis is a change for Hartselle and will keep people from going elsewhere who may want to have a glass of wine with their meal,\u201d Garrison said.\n\nTony Sapp, who lives near the Five Points area in Lawrence County, works frequently in Hartselle and is a customer at Bentley\u2019s.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to have another lunch choice that\u2019s not fast food,\u201d he said. \u201cBentley\u2019s serves good food, and I\u2019m looking forward to the Italian place coming.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the restaurant openings, The Something Blue Shoppe is doubling its floor space, while Life Church is doing an $850,000 renovation in the old Western Auto building it uses, and Georgia-based MEGA Granite and Marble has opened two showrooms in downtown Hartselle.\n\nThe Something Blue Shoppe has been in business almost 50 years and is a full-service bridal salon offering designer gowns and tuxedos, plus invitations and accessories. MEGA is the company that provided most of the granite and marble countertops in the new Mercedes-Benz Dome in Atlanta.\n\nAll of the projects will add to the city\u2019s revenue base, but the restaurants are creating the most chatter in town, said Jeff Johnson of the Department of Development.\n\n\u201cPeople are excited because we\u2019ve not had anything like this in downtown,\u201d he said.\n\nJeremy Reed, who grew up in Minnesota, moved south and opened Bentley\u2019s Burgers two years ago, which caters mostly to lunch customers.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re extremely busy here and I wanted to add a bar,\u201d he said, pointing out that the new business will be open at night.\n\nReed added Travis Smith as a business partner and they decided to move the business about two blocks to where an antique business had closed. He said they are adding a bar and plan to put televisions \u201ceverywhere for sports fans.\u201d\n\nIn August, the Alabama Cattlemen\u2019s Association selected Bentley\u2019s as one of eight semifinalists for the \u201cBest Burger in Bama\u201d contest.\n\nPizza Ed owners Eddie and Chandra Gwin looked for seven months before selecting Hartselle.\n\nThe business will be at 305 Main Street and will feature New York-style pizza and several different types of pasta, such as fettucine alfredo and spaghetti with meatballs.\n\nThe owners said pizza dough will be handmade and hand-slapped from only fresh ingredients, and pizzas will be cooked in a rotating firebrick pizza oven.\n\n\u201cDowntown is becoming more than a one-segment place,\u201d said Johnson, who worked for the city when antique shops dominated downtown. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen this type of diversification.\u201d\n\nHe said the city is also completing the final phase of a streetscape plan that started in 2008. The almost $450,000 project, which includes federal and local funds, will have all of downtown in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act when the project near Railroad and Corsbie streets is complete.\n\nTwo other downtown restaurants \u2014 Cahoots and Freight House \u2014 also have alcohol licenses.\n\nHartselle, with a population of about 14,500, was the largest municipality in the state without legal alcohol sales until voters approved a referendum 3,801 to 3,034 on Nov. 8, 2016. It was the fifth vote on the measure since 2002.\n\nAlcohol sales \u2014 which started in early 2017 \u2014 have produced more than $332,000 for city coffers.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Decatur Daily, http://www.decaturdaily.com/decaturdaily/index.shtml", "BELLEVUE, Iowa (AP) \u2014 For Kelly Hueneke and her family, opening a brewery was a concept that always had lingered on the somewhat-distant horizon.\n\nIt was a dream for someday, but not right away.\n\nA few years back, however, a combination of circumstance and opportunism accelerated Hueneke\u2019s plans.\n\n\u201cWe kind of always knew we wanted to do something in this industry, to create a family brewery,\u201d she told the Telegraph Herald . \u201cWe always thought we\u2019d do it eventually. But when this building became available, we knew it was the perfect opportunity. We jumped into it.\u201d\n\nKelly Hueneke and her husband, Nick Hueneke, were among the four original owners who opened River Ridge Brewing in 2016. The brewery is located in the heart of Bellevue\u2019s downtown, just across the street from the Mississippi River.\n\nTwo years later, the business has become a favorite among passing tourists and loyal local customers alike.\n\nRiver Ridge Brewing operates a one-barrel brewing system capable of brewing 31 gallons.\n\nKelly Hueneke said the process begins with the malt, which is generally purchased from Brew Haus in Dubuque.\n\nThe malt instills characteristics like color, flavor and head retention of a beer. At River Ridge Brewing, multiple malts often are combined to create the unique taste that defines a particular brew.\n\nThe malt eventually is placed within a mash tun, where the grain is mixed with hot water through the course of about one hour.\n\nThe brewers then extract the sugar water, called wort, and place it within a boil kettle. During the roughly one-hour boiling process, other flavors can be introduced. Depending on the particular beer, this can include everything from hops, honey or orange peels.\n\nThe product is cooled down on a chill plate before being placed in a fermenter, where it will remain for 10 to 14 days. During fermentation, the yeast eats up sugars and creates the alcohol.\n\nThe owners and operators of River Ridge Brewing conduct the brewing in their spare time, often allocating hours to the process in the evenings after they have completed their work days.\n\nFrom the beginning, it has been a labor of love.\n\n\u201cIt does put a little pressure and stress on you, getting a brewery up and running when you are still working regular jobs,\u201d said Nick Hueneke. \u201cBut it is something we really enjoy doing.\u201d\n\nThe original quartet of owners at River Ridge Brewing included Kelly and Nick Hueneke, as well as Kelly\u2019s brother, Jeremy Roth, and his wife, Nikki Roth.\n\nThe ownership group has subsequently undergone a change, with Jeremy and Nikki Roth leaving and four new owners joining the business.\n\nNic Hockenberry and his wife, Allison Simpson, fell in love with the brewery shortly after moving to Bellevue.\n\n\u201cWe were new to Bellevue and started hanging out here,\u201d Hockenberry recalled. \u201cThese kinds of spaces are what you consider third spaces \u2014 it is not work, it is not home, but it is a place you can be with people in the community and with friends and meet new people too.\u201d\n\nSimpson had tended bar at River Ridge Brewing before eventually becoming a co-owner.\n\n\u201cThis kind of cements Bellevue as our home,\u201d Simpson said.\n\nSimpson\u2019s father and stepmother, Greg and Amanda Simpson, also have joined the business as owners.\n\nThe lineup of beers includes seven mainstays: A wheat beer, an IPA, a honey blonde, an amber, a raspberry, a stout and a pale ale.\n\nNick Hueneke takes pride in both the diversity and quality of these core beers.\n\n\u201cWe knew we wanted to have our core selection of beers when we started out,\u201d he said. \u201cThose were our very first beers we ever put out and those have been our mainstays ever since.\u201d\n\nThe brewery also incorporates a variety of seasonal and special-edition beers into the mix.\n\nIn some cases, the limited edition beers were even more popular than expected.\n\nTotal Eclipse of the Hop, for instance, is an IPA made with local hops and other barrel-aged varieties. It was intended to be a one-time release coinciding with the solar eclipse.\n\nIt was so popular, however, that the owners have brought it back.\n\nMany of the beers at River Ridge incorporate local names: Flatbottom amber pays homage to the Mississippi River, for instance; Iowa Bale Ale is a nod to the region\u2019s farming roots.\n\nVerna\u2019s Honey Blonde, one of the brewery\u2019s mainstay creations, uses honey from local producers and even takes its name from a local inspiration \u2014 Kelly Hueneke\u2019s grandmother, Verna, who encouraged them to create a honey beer in the first place.\n\nA new seasonal brew, christened Grandpa Al\u2019s Pumpkin Ale, incorporates the moniker of Nick Hueneke\u2019s grandfather. The brew uses pumpkins that were raised in Al\u2019s garden.\n\nKelly Hueneke said such personal touches are much more than a gimmick. Rather, they speak to the essence of River Ridge Brewing.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what it really is about for us,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s about local and it is about family.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Telegraph Herald, http://www.thonline.com", "OMAHA, Neb. (AP) \u2014 More than 100 years ago, a lavish mansion was built on land owned by Omaha\u2019s first mayor, Jesse Lowe, overlooking his burgeoning town.\n\nThe Victorian estate on Cuming Street measured nearly 5,000 square feet. A turret rose skyward from the northeast corner of North 39th Street.\n\nEach room was built using a different type of imported wood. The walkways were paved with Italian tile, and half a dozen acanthus leaf-etched fireplaces oozed affluence.\n\nThe house spoke perfectly to the excesses of Omaha\u2019s early claim-stakers. But its flamboyance would be short-lived.\n\nAfter the Great Depression, the mansion\u2019s third owners cordoned off the foyer and grand staircase and walled off six apartments. In the decades that followed, ceilings cracked, walls crumbled and the estate became a dilapidated has-been, ripe for demolition.\n\nFour years ago, Omaha resident Chris Janicek bought the mansion. Since then, the former U.S. Senate candidate and Cupcake Omaha owner has spent about 60 hours a month restoring it. Janicek\u2019s work-in-progress will soon be open to the public as part of the Joslyn Castle Historic Home Tour, the Omaha World-Herald reported.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a showpiece when it\u2019s done,\u201d he said.\n\nEnvisioning the final product will take imagination. Some of the home\u2019s windows are boarded up, and it still needs a year or two of work before it\u2019s complete, Janicek said.\n\nStill, Janicek has overhauled and stripped back decades of modifications to reveal much of the property\u2019s original beauty.\n\nSome of the house\u2019s crumbling plaster couldn\u2019t be saved, and rerouting plumbing would have been too costly, so the house now has several drop ceilings. The project has been a compromise of restoration and renovation.\n\nMost original wood is intact, but the Italian tile floors were too damaged to keep. Much of the house is now drywall.\n\nJanicek paid $37,500 for the property, and estimates he will have spent about $200,000 more by the time it\u2019s all finished.\n\nInitially, Janicek planned to strip the house, find new spots for its elegant elements, then rent it out. But with each step he took in the process, he fell deeper in love with the house. Its ornate fireplaces and horned candle sconces remind him of \u201cBeauty and the Beast.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow everything is sculpted has a French patina to it, very curvaceous and sexy,\u201d he said.\n\nThe house was included in the Joslyn Castle Historic Home Tour not only for its beauty and history, but also to satisfy people\u2019s curiosity.\n\n\u201cIt holds a lot of mystery for me, with the boarded windows,\u201d said Kelli Bello, who works at Joslyn Castle down the street. \u201cYou just want to get in there and poke around.\u201d\n\nThanks to an earlier expansion, the lower portion of the turret now sits inside the home\u2019s main floor. It creates a fascinating \u201chouse inside a house\u201d effect. On the third story, the turret comes to a peak in a hollow conic room with enchanting acoustics that can leave you giggling.\n\nThe mansion wows with its spectacular views of St. Cecilia Cathedral and Harvest Community Church, which look \u201clike a painting\u201d at sunset, Janicek said.\n\nJanicek hasn\u2019t decided whether he\u2019ll remain living in his current house or sell it to move here, but he admits it\u2019ll be tough to resist the urge.\n\n\u201cEvery time I walk into this place,\u201d he said, \u201cit blows my mind that someone lived like this in the 1800s.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Omaha World-Herald, http://www.omaha.com", "DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) \u2014 In class writings, Cameron Carico said he wanted to \u201cmeet God.\u201d\n\nThe teen, who had an upbeat personality, wrote that he often cried in his room. And though Cameron\u2019s family knew of his depression, they had no idea how severe it was.\n\nOn Jan. 28, 2012, the 15-year-old Johnston High School freshman took his own life. The next day, another Johnston student did the same. There were a total of three suicides that year in the Des Moines suburb\u2019s school district.\n\nBrian Carico was principal at Johnston Middle School when his son killed himself, and he can\u2019t help but feel that he and other school staff could have done more.\n\n\u201cI felt like we failed him in some way,\u201d Carico, now associate principal at Ames High School, told the Des Moines Register . \u201cSomething was not right.\n\n\u201cI knew then and there I needed to do something.\u201d\n\nWith suicides across Iowa at their highest levels in more than a decade, schools are trying to stem future deaths by stepping up training focused on identifying students at risk and getting them help.\n\nIowa\u2019s suicide rate is growing faster than many states and exceeds the national average, according to the Centers for Disease Control.\n\nA year after Cameron\u2019s funeral, Carico met Democratic Sen.

(AP Photo/Marco Ugarte)\n\nIRAPUATO, Mexico (AP) \u2014 Local Mexican officials again helped thousands of Central American migrants find rides Sunday on the latest leg of their journey toward the U.S. border.\n\nAt a toll plaza to the west of the central Mexico city of Queretaro, where the group spent Saturday night, police prevented migrants from waylaying trucks on their own, but officers did help them find vehicles for rides.\n\nThe government of Queretaro said via Twitter that 6,531 migrants had moved through the state between Friday and Saturday. It said that 5,771 of those departed Sunday morning after staying in three shelters it had prepared, the largest of which was a soccer stadium in the state capital.\n\nThose numbers appeared even higher than counts made by officials when the group was in Mexico City for several days, raising the possibility that other migrants had caught up to the main caravan.\n\nStarting out before dawn, the migrants went on to Irapuato, an agricultural city about 62 miles (100 kilometers) to the west in neighboring Guanajuato state, and set up camp around a local family center and small sports complex.\n\nAs on other days, the migrants jumped at any opportunity to catch rides. They piled onto flatbed trucks, hung from car carrier trailers and even stacked themselves four levels high on a truck that usually carries pigs.\n\nMiguel Ortiz of Honduras reclined in the pig trailer with his wife and son. He said they were headed to U.S. for a better life where they could work for more than just putting food on the table.\n\nMaria Isabel Reyes, 39, of Honduras travelled with her three daughters and a granddaughter.\n\n\u201cI feel happy by the grace of God,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause we\u2019re advancing little by little, but all of us here are moving forward.\u201d\n\nThe migrants appear to be on a path toward Tijuana across the border from San Diego, which is still some 1,600 miles (2,575 kilometers) away.\n\nThe caravan became a campaign issue in U.S. midterm elections and U.S. President Donald Trump has ordered the deployment of over 5,000 military troops to the border to fend off the migrants. Trump has insinuated without proof that there are criminals or even terrorists in the group.\n\nMany migrants say they are fleeing rampant poverty, gang violence and political instability primarily in the Central American countries of Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua, and they have now been on the road for weeks.\n\nMexico has offered refuge, asylum or work visas to the migrants, and its government said 2,697 temporary visas had been issued to individuals and families to cover them while they wait for the 45-day application process for a more permanent status.\n\nBut most vowed to continue to the United States.\n\n\u201cWe can earn more (in the U.S.) and give something to our family. But there (in Honduras) even when we want to give something to our children, we can\u2019t because the little we earn it\u2019s just for food, to pay the house and the light, nothing else,\u201d said Nubia Morazan, 28, of Honduras as she prepared to set out Sunday with her husband and two children.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Christopher Sherman in Mexico City contributed to this report.", "LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) \u2014 Little Rock officials announced earlier this month that they will try to reduce street homelessness by 25 percent in Ward 1 by 2020, the first step in a partnership with a group that is striving to end street homelessness in 150 cities across the world by 2030.\n\nThe Institute of Global Homelessness has partnered with eight \u201cvanguard cities\u201d so far. Little Rock will join Chicago as the second city in the United States. Other cities are Adelaide, Australia; Edmonton, Canada; Glasgow, Scotland; Greater Manchester, United Kingdom; Rijeka, Croatia; and Tshwane, South Africa.\n\nThe institute is affiliated with and partially funded by Chicago\u2019s DePaul University and Depaul International. Depaul Charity is a branch of Depaul International and operates Jericho Way Center, a day resource center for the homeless in Little Rock.\n\nThe institute plans to announce four more city partnerships in the next six months.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re a resource,\u201d City Manager Bruce Moore said. \u201cThis is the work they do every day.\u201d\n\nMoore and Ward 4 City Director Capi Peck went to Chicago to meet with institute leaders in the spring. Several service providers said they learned about the partnership recently.\n\nPeck said that at first she was wary about the lofty goal, but as she has learned more, her excitement has grown.\n\n\u201cUltimately, we all have the same goal,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a daunting task, but I think it\u2019s achievable.\u201d\n\nLittle Rock was selected in part because of its status as a \u201ccity of compassion,\u201d and it\u2019s representative of smaller cities, said Molly Seeley, an institute program director.\n\n\u201cYou in Little Rock now carry a responsibility not only to Little Rock, but to your country and the rest of the world,\u201d Dame Louise Casey said of the partnership. Casey, a U.K. resident, is the advisory committee chairwoman for the institute.\n\nAt a morning meeting with service providers and city officials, institute representatives outlined plans to achieve the goal. The first step will be to count the homeless on the city streets, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported.\n\nThe 2017 census of the homeless in the Little Rock metropolitan area showed that there were about 990 homeless people in Lonoke, Prairie, Pulaski and Saline counties. Just over half of those did not have regular shelter.\n\nSeeley said the count will be similar to the point-in-time census of the homeless that is conducted every other year.\n\nAfter that, a steering committee that has not yet been selected will examine what work is being done in Little Rock to help the homeless and why people become homeless in the city, and will try to divert people away from homelessness.\n\nSeeley said there will be monthly check-in calls with the institute to see how Little Rock is progressing. If service providers or city officials have questions, they can connect with experts.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to come in and say, \u2018This is what you do,\u2019\u201d Seeley added.\n\nThe institute will help Little Rock come up with a plan. Little Rock will commit to reducing street homelessness by 25 percent in Ward 1, which includes downtown and other areas of northeast Little Rock. The city also will commit to adopting the institute\u2019s definition of ending street homelessness, becoming a part of the institute\u2019s sliding scale of data and report progress and sending at least two representatives to an annual learning workshop.\n\nSeeley said the institute will help connect Little Rock officials with homeless advocates from other cities and keep them accountable to meet their goal.\n\nEarlier this year, Little Rock Mayor Mark Stodola announced that the city was at \u201cfunctional zero\u201d for homeless veterans, which means that service providers know who the homeless veterans are and can put them in shelter quickly.\n\nIn 2006, the city pledged to end chronic homelessness by 2016, but a report this year from the Central Arkansas Team Care for the Homeless showed 82 chronically homeless individuals staying in emergency shelters.\n\nThe difference between the Ward 1 goal and previous goals is the presence of a third party, Casey said.\n\n\u201cWe just reflect back what people already know, but find quite difficult to say to each other,\u201d Casey said. \u201cLet\u2019s just remind ourselves why we\u2019re all here.\u201d\n\nCasey said Chicago has seen decreases in veteran homelessness since the city\u2019s partnership with the institute started. The city has been working on bringing veteran homelessness down since 2014, three years before the institute\u2019s program began.\n\nShe also said that in Adelaide, officials have a new understanding of why people become homeless, which she thinks will happen soon for Little Rock.\n\nChris Porter, the homelessness advocate who works for Little Rock, said he was hopeful about having an official starting point and smaller goals to meet along the way to ending street homelessness.\n\n\u201cAll those people who are suffering here, if we can work in a certain area, I think that\u2019s a great idea,\u201d Porter said. \u201cI think we should not neglect the other areas because we are spending that energy in one area.\u201d\n\nBut he added that the city would need more housing because there isn\u2019t enough space to put everyone who is homeless into homes right now.\n\nCasey added that the eventual goal is to end homelessness overall.\n\n\u201cIf we solve street homelessness, we can look at sheltered homelessness,\u201d Casey said. \u201cIf we solve sheltered homelessness, we can look at people in insecure housing.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, http://www.arkansasonline.com", "Customers look around during the grand opening of Mother Road Market in Tulsa, Okla., on Nov.2, 2018.

(AP) \u2014 The days of Mountain Home firefighters potentially getting lost when responding to an emergency are now numbered. Thanks to a new system being put into place, the firefighters will be given directions and a host of other information in real time.\n\nThe system is called Active911 and involves software loaded on smartphones and tablets. The fire department is in the process of mounting iPads in firetrucks to accommodate the new software, the Baxter Bulletin reported.\n\nAs an example, let\u2019s say there is an accident on the Sheid-Hopper Bypass. A witness with a cellphone calls 911 and says the accident is on the bypass \u201cnear\u201d College Street.\n\nThe 911 system pings the person\u2019s cellphone and gets the address of the nearest cell tower. When they dispatch the Mountain Home Fire Department, the address of that cell tower will populate on the iPads in the trucks and on any firefighter\u2019s smartphone.\n\nAdditionally, the map firefighters see will show the location of fire hydrants nearby.\n\nLet\u2019s say Engine 1 responds to the accident scene with four firefighters aboard, all of whom have the Active911 application on their smartphones. Any firefighter who opens the application on a phone or tablet will be able to see Engine 1 and the four firefighters traveling across the map in real time.\n\nNow, let\u2019s say Engine 2 responds from a different location. Meanwhile, Engine 1 discovers the accident is not really \u201cnear\u201d College Street, but rather half a mile east of the street. And the accident is not in the westbound lanes as reported by the caller but in the eastbound lanes.\n\nEngine 1 stops at the accident and reports they are on scene. Now, Engine 2 knows exactly where the accident is because they can see on their map where Engine 1 has stopped, thus saving them time in locating the accident.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how long you\u2019ve lived here, you\u2019re always going to come across streets you\u2019ve never heard of,\u201d said Cpt. Kris Quick who\u2019s heading up the effort to bring the system on line.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also easy to forget where a street is. It\u2019s great to have the route just pop up on the screen,\u201d Quick said.\n\nThe system provides the quickest route available, but cannot take into account given conditions on any random day.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s say we\u2019ve got multiple trucks responding to an incident and the first truck in encounters construction,\u201d Quick said. \u201cThey can alter the route and other responding units will go around the obstruction.\u201d\n\nMaps with real-time locations of people and trucks aren\u2019t the only pieces of information the system conveys.\n\nThanks to the Mountain Home Street Department, every fire hydrant in the city is now mapped out. When the fire department got the new software, the water department gave them precise GPS locations to all the fire hydrants.\n\nOther information is being added to the system as time allows. Plans of buildings can be entered, along with locations of hazardous materials, drawings, pictures and other information about specific addresses.\n\nIn the case of fire hydrants, the department will eventually enter the flow ratings for each hydrant. If two fire hydrants are near a home on fire and one hydrant can provide 2,000 gallons per minute while the other can only provide 500, firefighters can choose the hydrant based on the size of the blaze.\n\nIn the future, the system will improve as firefighters enter more data about specific locations. One of the improvements they hope to make is to replace the Google mapping with the local 911 mapping, a more accurate and up-to-date rendering of local roads.\n\n\u201cThis system will get better and better as the years go by and we add more information,\u201d Quick said. \u201cThere are cities that have been using it for several years and they say it gets better over time as you add more data to it, so it will always be a work in progress.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Baxter Bulletin, http://www.baxterbulletin.com", "MIAMI, Okla.

Choate, now of Nacogdoches, Texas, through the efforts of many including Miami Public Library\u2019s Barbara Becker. The ring was worn on the Miami High School alumni\u2019s finger for the last time in July 1966.\n\nChoate got the class ring in April 1966 and when he was in high school and inadvertently left the ring by a sink while washing his hands at a Kansas City, Kansas doctor\u2019s office. By the time Choate reached the parking lot and noticed it missing from his finger, it was gone when he went back to search for the ring.\n\n\u201cHe was working up there after he graduated in the summer of \u201966, and got hurt on the job and went to the doctor,\u201d Becker told The Miami News-Record . \u201cThat was the last he saw it.\u201d\n\nChoate wrote the ring off as a loss. And in later years had even purchased a replica replacement class ring. After graduation from MHS he attended Northeastern A& M College before joining and serving in the military, graduated from Mississippi State receiving his doctorate and became a successful pediatrics licensed professional counselor.\n\nIn the meantime, the class ring with the initials ROC had been found in the grass at a football stadium in the fall of 1966 by then 17-year-old Janet Critchfield and her father while sitting in the bleachers at a football game at Ruskin High School in Kansas City.\n\nThere is no knowledge of how the ring came to rest in the grass of the Kansas City football stadium.\n\nCritchfield\u2019s father put the ring away in his safe deposit box where it had remained for all these years. After her father\u2019s death in June, while sorting through his belongings Critchfield again discovered the Wardog class ring with a note handwritten by her father attached.\n\nCritchfield began a quest to return the ring to the Wardog who had lost it so many years ago.\n\nCritchfield is a genealogy enthusiast and using her acquired skills, called the Miami Public Library where she made contact with the library\u2019s genealogist Barbara Becker.\n\n\u201cYou know Miami\u2019s the only team in the whole United States that\u2019s called the Wardogs, so Janet called me,\u201d Becker said.\n\nBecker has years of genealogy experience and expertise and has taught classes at the Miami Public Library to hundreds of students. One of her students, Lynda Roten who meets with a genealogy group at the library heard the ring\u2019s story from Becker and contacted a friend, also a MHS 1966 graduate Carolyn Matthews.\n\nRoten and Matthews were able to narrow down three MHS 1966 graduates with the initials of ROC, and eventually down to Choate and contacted him about his recovered ring.\n\n\u201cCarolyn and Bob remained friends and in contact over the years, and he was a friend of hers on Facebook and she sent him a private message to call me about the ring, and he did,\u201d Roten said.\n\nChoate and the others made arrangements to meet at the Miami Public Library.\n\nOn Sept. 15 Choate and his wife, Teri, traveled to Miami from Mississippi to meet all involved in the recovery of the class ring, including Critchfield.\n\nCritchfield stopped in Miami that day to return the ring and meet Choate while on a trip to Missouri to see family from her home in Vancouver, Washington.\n\n\u201cHe was thrilled to get the ring back. He even remembered what he paid for it, I think he said it was $65,\u201d Becker said.\n\nChoate had last been in Miami for his MHS class reunion two years ago.\n\nThe meeting place was a perfect full circle location to bring all involved together because Choate had a strong connection growing up and spending time at the Miami Public Library, and the genealogists involved were able to see the importance and fruition of their dedicated work.\n\nBecker said the library offers many services and opportunities for valuable genealogy and historical research.\n\n\u201cHe made a special trip,\u201d Becker said. \u201cHe said the library was kind of his sanctum and meant a lot to him as he was growing up. He said he read over 3,000 books out of this library. It\u2019s just one of those things that was meant to be.\u201d\n\nWith his wife Teri beside him wearing his sparkling 1966 Wardog class ring, Choate was also able to give his wife a tour of his hometown.

(AP) \u2014 Smoke from the raging Northern California wildfires seeped into the Golden 1 Center, giving LeBron James a headache and leading Los Angeles Lakers coach Luke Walton to shorten his players\u2019 stints on the court.\n\nBut the haze did little to slow James and the Lakers, who used their best defensive effort of the year to earn a 101-86 win Saturday night against the Sacramento Kings, lifting Los Angeles to .500 (6-6) for the first time this season.\n\nJames scored 25 points and recently signed Tyson Chandler had 12 rebounds for the Lakers, who began the season with three straight losses but now have won four of their last five.\n\nThe Lakers held the Kings, who entered the game averaging 118 points per contest, to their lowest scoring total of the season. It was only the second time Sacramento has been held below 100 points this season, and it marked the first time Los Angeles had held an opponent below 100.\n\n\u201cWe won the game tonight because of our defense,\u201d Walton said. \u201cI think we\u2019ve been showing glimpses of that defense, but tonight was the first time we\u2019ve been able to put it together for long stretches.\u201d\n\nJames hit three 3-pointers and had seven rebounds. He only had two assists, though he often fed teammates for open shots that missed - including Lonzo Ball, who was 2 for 10 from the field.\n\nChandler, playing in his second game with the Lakers, logged 23 minutes and scored three points. In his first game, the Lakers held Minnesota to 110 points \u2014 which, up until Saturday night\u2019s game, was tied for the lowest by any Los Angeles opponent this season.\n\n\u201cFor me, the defense has been easy because it comes naturally, but it\u2019s a matter of getting into the offense,\u201d Chandler said. \u201cThe key for us was getting back on transition, building walls, forcing them into a half-court offense.\u201d\n\nJames said the Lakers\u2019 center duo of starter JaVale McGee and Chandler, who combined for 20 rebounds and a pair of steals, has solidified a defense that struggled early in the season.\n\n\u2033(Chandler) just shored up our front court. We have a great 1-2 punch now with JaVale and Tyson,\u201d James said.\n\nDe\u2019Aaron Fox had 17 of his 21 points in the first half to lead the Kings, who shot 35 percent from the field and went 6 for 25 on 3-pointers. Willie Cauley-Stein added 12 points and 12 rebounds.\n\nFox said the Lakers were able to shut down the Kings\u2019 fast-paced offense by getting back quickly on defense.\n\n\u201cThey got back every shot attempt and they sent four people back,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we didn\u2019t shoot the ball well.\u201d\n\nThe Lakers were ahead by six points at the half and held a 76-65 lead entering the fourth quarter. They built that lead to 20 points at 88-68 before the Kings responded with a 10-0 run, but Sacramento got no closer.\n\nON THE REBOUND\n\nThe Lakers had a season-high 59 rebounds, including a season-best 17 on the offensive end. Five of Chandler\u2019s rebounds were offensive, while McGee had three of his eight rebounds on offense.\n\nLEBRON\u2019S RETURN\n\nJames made his NBA debut in Sacramento 15 seasons ago as the No. 1 overall draft pick of the Cleveland Cavaliers. He had 25 points, nine assists, six rebounds and four steals in the Oct. 29, 2003, game in which the Kings defeated the Cavs 106-92.\n\nBAD SHOOTING\n\nThe Kings were held to their worst field goal percentage of the season, going 32 of 92 from the field.

Authorities called in a mobile DNA lab and anthropologists to help identify victims of the most destructive wildfire in California history.\n\nBy early afternoon, one of the two black hearses stationed in Paradise had picked up another set of remains.\n\nPeople looking for friends or relatives called evacuation centers, hospitals, police and the coroner\u2019s office.\n\n(Nov. 11)\n\nSol Bechtold drove from shelter to shelter looking for his mother, Joanne Caddy, a 75-year-old widow whose house burned down along with the rest of her neighborhood in Magalia, just north of Paradise. She lived alone and did not drive.\n\nBechtold posted a flyer on social media, pinned it to bulletin boards at shelters and showed her picture around to evacuees, asking if anyone recognized her. He ran across a few of Caddy\u2019s neighbors, but they hadn\u2019t seen her.\n\nAs he drove through the smoke and haze to yet another shelter, he said, \u201cI\u2019m also under a dark emotional cloud. Your mother\u2019s somewhere and you don\u2019t know where she\u2019s at. You don\u2019t know if she\u2019s safe.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI\u2019ve got to stay positive. She\u2019s a strong, smart woman.\u201d\n\nOfficials and relatives held out hope that many of those unaccounted for were safe and simply had no cellphones or other ways to contact loved ones. The sheriff\u2019s office in the stricken northern county set up a missing-persons call center to help connect people.\n\nGov. Jerry Brown said California is requesting aid from the Trump administration. President Donald Trump has blamed \u201cpoor\u201d forest management for the fires. Brown told a press briefing that federal and state governments must do more forest management but said that\u2019s not the source of the problem.\n\n\u201cManaging all the forests everywhere we can does not stop climate change,\u201d Brown said. \u201cAnd those who deny that are definitely contributing to the tragedies that we\u2019re now witnessing, and will continue to witness in the coming years.\u201d\n\nFirefighters battling the Camp Fire with shovels and bulldozers, flame retardants and hoses expected wind gusts up to 40 mph (64 kph) overnight Sunday. Officials said they expect the wind to die down by midday Monday, but there was still no rain in sight.\n\nMore than 8,000 firefighters in all battled three large wildfires burning across nearly 400 square miles (1,040 square kilometers) in Northern and Southern California, with out-of-state crews arriving.\n\nTwo people were found dead in Southern California , where flames tore through Malibu mansions and working-class Los Angeles suburbs.\n\nThe burned bodies were discovered in a driveway in Malibu, where residents forced from their homes included Lady Gaga, Kim Kardashian West and Martin Sheen. Actor Gerard Butler said on Instagram that his Malibu home was \u201chalf-gone,\u201d and a publicist for Camille Grammer Meyer said the \u201cReal Housewives of Beverly Hills\u201d star lost her home in the seaside enclave.\n\nFlames also besieged Thousand Oaks, the Southern California city in mourning over the massacre of 12 people in a shooting rampage at a country music bar Wednesday night.\n\nIn Northern California, Sheriff Honea said the devastation was so complete in some neighborhoods that \u201cit\u2019s very difficult to determine whether or not there may be human remains there.\n\nAuthorities were also bringing in a DNA lab and said officials would reach out to relatives who had registered their missing loved ones to aid in identifying the dead after the blaze destroyed more than 6,700 buildings, nearly all of them homes.\n\nThe 29 dead in Northern California matched the deadliest single fire on record, a 1933 blaze in Griffith Park in Los Angeles, though a series of wildfires in Northern California wine country last fall killed 44 people and destroyed more than 5,000 homes.\n\nThe Camp Fire on Sunday stood at 173 square miles (450 square kilometers) and was 25 percent contained, but Cal Fire spokesman Bill Murphy warned that gusty winds predicted into Monday morning could spark \u201cexplosive fire behavior.\u201d\n\nAbout 150,000 people statewide were under evacuation orders, most of them in Southern California, where nearly 180 structures were destroyed, including a large mobile home community in rugged Santa Monica Mountains north of Malibu.\n\nBrown\u2019s request for a major-disaster declaration from Trump would make victims eligible for crisis counseling, housing and unemployment help, and legal aid.\n\nDrought, warmer weather attributed to climate change, and the building of homes deeper into forests have led to longer and more destructive wildfire seasons in California. While California officially emerged from a five-year drought last year, much of the northern two-thirds of the state is abnormally dry.\n\n\u201cThings are not the way they were 10 years ago. ... The rate of spread is exponentially more than it used to be,\u201d said Ventura County Fire Chief Mark Lorenzen, urging residents to evacuate rather than stay behind to try to defend their homes.\n\nOne of the Northern California fire\u2019s victims was an ailing woman whose body was found in bed in a burned-out house in Concow, near Paradise.\n\nEllen Walker, who was in her early 70s, was home alone when the fire struck on Thursday, according to Nancy Breeding, a family friend.\n\nBreeding said Walker\u2019s husband was at work and called a neighbor to tell his wife to evacuate, but she was on medication and might not have been alert. Authorities confirmed her death late Friday.\n\n\u201cA fireman took him to the house to confirm,\u201d Breeding said. \u201cThis is a devastating thing, and it\u2019s happening to so many people.\u201d\n\n___\n\nSelsky reported from Salem, Oregon.

(Craig Hudson/The Charleston Gazette-Mail via AP)\n\nCHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) \u2014 The resignation of a West Virginia Supreme Court justice recently convicted of federal charges prompted the governor Sunday to cancel a special legislative session that was to consider the justice\u2019s removal.\n\nIt was the latest development in an impeachment scandal miring some past and present justices in varying accusations including abuse of authority and failure to rein in excessive spending that engulfed the state\u2019s highest court for months.\n\nRepublican Gov. Jim Juestice\u2019s office said late Saturday he received a letter from Justice Allen Loughry and accepted his resignation effective at the close of business Monday. Justice had no further comment and Loughry\u2019s one-sentence resignation letter didn\u2019t elaborate.\n\nLoughry was convicted last month of federal criminal charges including wire fraud involving his personal use of state cars and fuel cards and mail fraud. He has requested a new trial.\n\nLast week Justice had called the special session for Tuesday, saying in a proclamation that it would consider removing Loughry from his post. Another proclamation Sunday canceled the special session in light of Loughry\u2019s resignation.\n\nLoughry couldn\u2019t be reached for comment. His attorney, John A. Carr, said in an email he would have no comment.\n\nLoughry and three other justices were impeached by the West Virginia House in August over questions involving lavish office renovations that evolved into varying accusations of corruption, incompetence and neglect of duty. One of them, Justice Beth Walker, was cleared of an impeachment charge at a Senate trial last month.\n\nThe West Virginia Supreme Court last month effectively halted the Legislature\u2019s remaining efforts to impeach the state\u2019s justices as a violation of the separate of power doctrine. The court ruled that the Senate lacks jurisdiction to pursue its impeachment trial of Justice Margaret Workman.\n\nThe Senate had postponed Workman\u2019s trial after the presiding judge didn\u2019t show up following the court ruling. A panel of acting justices said the court\u2019s decision to stop Workman\u2019s impeachment hearing also applies to retired Justice Robin Davis and Loughry, who had petitioned the court to intervene.\n\nSenate President Mitch Carmichael, a Republican, lauded the resignation announcement Saturday.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate that Justice Loughry has decided to do the right thing and step down from the Court,\u201d Carmichael said in a statement.\n\nJudicial elections in West Virginia became nonpartisan in 2016, but the court\u2019s impeachment scandal this year stirred political attacks. Some Democrats argued that the court\u2019s shakeup over spending and other issues was a power grab by the Republican-led legislature.\n\nOn Election Day, two state Supreme Court justices appointed to the court after the scandal broke won election to continue on the bench: Former House speaker Tim Armstead and ex-Congressman Evan Jenkins won those races Tuesday night, each defeating nine other candidates. They had originally been appointed by Justice to fill two of the seats on the state\u2019s highest court pending the midterm election.\n\nArmstead will complete the term of Justice Menis Ketchum, who announced his resignation on the eve of the House\u2019s impeachment proceedings. The term runs through 2020.\n\nJenkins will serve until 2024, when the term of retired Justice Robin Davis ends.

The report said the fire was reported around 2:24 p.m. Thursday, two minutes after the outage.\n\nVenture County Fire Chief Mark Lorenzen hadn\u2019t heard about the Edison report. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t surprise me\u201d if it turns out that winds caused equipment failure that sparked a fire, he said.\n\nThe death toll stood at two. The severely burned bodies were discovered in a car on a long residential driveway on a stretch of Mulholland Highway in Malibu, where most of the surrounding structures had burned. Authorities said investigators believed the driver became disoriented and the car was overcome by fire.\n\nThe deaths came as authorities in Northern California announced the death toll from a massive wildfire there has reached 29 people, bringing the statewide total to 31.\n\nProgress was made on the lines of smaller fire to the west in Ventura County, which was 70 percent contained at about 7 square miles (18 square kilometers), and evacuations were greatly reduced. But thousands remained under evacuation orders due to the Woolsey fire.\n\nThree firefighters suffered minor injuries, Osby said.\n\nAlso injured was a well-known member of the Malibu City Council. Councilman Jefferson \u201cZuma Jay\u201d Wagner was injured while trying to save his home, which burned down, Councilman Skylar Peak told reporters Sunday.\n\nPeak said Wagner was hospitalized but was expected to recover. Wagner runs Zuma Jay Surfboards, a longtime fixture on Pacific Coast Highway near the landmark Malibu Pier.\n\nThe extensive celebrity community within Malibu wasn\u2019t spared. Actor Gerard Butler and Camille Grammer Meyer of \u201cThe Real Housewives of Beverly Hills\u201d were among those whose homes were damaged or destroyed.\n\nAreas that suffered significant destruction included Seminole Springs, a mobile home community nestled by a lake in the rugged Santa Monica Mountains north of Malibu.\n\n\u201cI smelled the fire and didn\u2019t think, grabbed my dog and left,\u201d resident Lisa Kin said Sunday, tears in her eyes and her voice breaking. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t burned in decades and I knew we didn\u2019t stand a chance.\u201d\n\nShe described Seminole Springs as a \u201cbeautiful community\u201d of families and older people who appreciate its tranquility. But she said she always feared a wildfire since she moved there 15 years ago, especially during recent years in which there\u2019s been almost no rain.\n\nRoger Kelly, 69, who defied orders and hiked back into Seminole Springs, estimated 90 of its approximately 220 homes were destroyed. He had seen a neighbor\u2019s home intact in a TV news aerial shot and hoped his home had survived. It did, but just a half-block away others were laid to waste.\n\n\u201cI just started weeping,\u201d he said. \u201cI just broke down. Your first view of it (the destruction), man it just gets you.\u201d\n\nKelly said he had filled trash cans with water, soaked towels and readied a garden hose to defend his home early Friday, but when the air filled with smoke he and his wife fled the community where he has lived for 28 years and raised two children.\n\nWhen he returned, virtually everything on the landscape around the community had been reduced to ash.\n\nSpot fires continued to occur late Sunday afternoon near the Malibu campus of Pepperdine University, where 3,500 students were sheltering in place. The university said it was closing Malibu campus and its Calabasas campus to the north until Nov. 26 but classes would be remotely administered online and through email.\n\nSanta Ana winds, produced by surface high pressure over the Great Basin squeezing air down through canyons and passes in Southern California\u2019s mountain ranges, are common in the fall and have a long history of fanning destructive wildfires in the region.\n\nBut fire officials say fire behavior has changed statewide after years of drought and record summer heat that have left vegetation extremely crisp and dry.\n\n\u201cThings are not the way they were 10 years ago ... the rate of spread is exponentially more than it used to be,\u201d said Lorenzen, urging residents to not put their lives at risk by trying to defend their own homes instead of evacuating.\n\nThat change has impacted the ability to move firefighting resources around the state, officials said.\n\n\u201cTypically this time of year when we get fires in Southern California we can rely upon our mutual aid partners in Northern California to come assist us because this time of year they\u2019ve already had significant rainfall or even snow,\u201d said Osby, the LA County fire chief.\n\nWith the devastation and loss of life in the Northern California fire, \u201cit\u2019s evident from that situation statewide that we\u2019re in climate change and it\u2019s going to be here for the foreseeable future,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers John Antczak and Andrew Dalton contributed to this report from Los Angeles.", "", "Angel Poventud, who voted early, volunteers his time to hand out pizza and snacks to people waiting in line in Atlanta, Nov. 6, 2018. The wait time to vote at the Pittman Park precinct in Atlanta was reported to be three hours. Pizza and snacks were donated for the people waiting in line. (Bob Andres/Atlanta Journal-Constitution via AP)\n\nATLANTA (AP) \u2014 When Barbara Williams arrived at the Pittman Park Recreation Center just before noon on Election Day to cast her vote, she saw a line so long that the end wasn\u2019t in sight.\n\n\u201cThere were so many people, you couldn\u2019t count them,\u201d Williams recalled. \u201cThey were looped around. The line started at the door and it snaked around to the left.\u201d\n\nShe ultimately waited four hours to use one of the three voting machines at the precinct where the 58-year-old retiree has voted in every election since she turned 18. Others reported similar challenges to voting at Pittman Park, located in the heart of Atlanta\u2019s oldest black neighborhood: Hours-long waits and voters leaving in frustration. For Williams and others who sought to vote at Pittman Park, the hurdles echoed a long history of voter suppression unfolding in a race in which Democrat Stacey Abrams is seeking to become the nation\u2019s first black female governor.\n\n\u201cI feel like they didn\u2019t want her to win,\u201d Williams said of Abrams. \u201cThey made things so that we would get aggravated and people would leave.\u201d\n\nThe race between Abrams and her Republican opponent, Brian Kemp, is still too close to call five days after the election. Kemp has denied any attempt to suppress the vote. But his background as someone who, as secretary of state, deleted inactive voters from registration rolls and enforced an \u201cexact match\u201d policy that could have prevented thousands from registering to vote, has brought the issue of minority access to the polls to the forefront.\n\nThat\u2019s especially true at Pittman Park, which has long been a center of black civic and community life. Many residents learned to swim there at the only pool they were allowed to use during the segregation era. Today, it offers after school care, classes for seniors and a space for local meetings.\n\nIt has been a precinct for as long as Douglas Dean, head of the Pittsburgh Neighborhood Association, can remember. Three years ago, it was consolidated with a nearby polling station, doubling the number of registered voters to nearly 3,800, according to the Fulton County Board of Elections, one of the factors that may have played into last week\u2019s lines.\n\n\u201cThere is no excuse for what happened here in this election,\u201d said Dean, 71, and a former state representative. \u201cGeorgia is changing and there are some whites who want everything to stay the same so that they remain in power. We\u2019ve been fighting this battle for years. This is nothing new.\u201d\n\nThe Rev. Jesse Jackson, who had been troubleshooting election irregularities in the city that day, was at the precinct Tuesday to investigate.\n\n\u201cThey were four deep in the room,\u201d Jackson said, describing the scene in an interview. \u201cSome were in wheelchairs, some were on walkers, some were sick. I appealed to them to stay. Either incompetence or corruption or both is what happened.\u201d\n\nWilliams fought back, maintaining her place in line and pleading with others to do the same.\n\n\u201cIt was important for me to vote,\u201d she explained. \u201cI vote in every election. I\u2019m a human being and I have a life and I try for it to be better. A whole lot of people left. I even tried to get some of them to stay. I said, \u2018That\u2019s what they want you to do.\u2019\u201d\n\nJoseph Jarrett came at around the same time as Williams, with his 4-year-old son in tow to show him the significance of voting. When he saw the line, Jarrett left, not wanting to stand there with a restless toddler.\n\nHe debated whether or not to come back. On his mind were lessons from childhood. He thought of the Mississippi voting activist Fannie Lou Hamer, a personal hero, and what she did for the community. Jarrett retuned to the line just after 2 p.m. Three hours later, he cast his ballot.\n\n\u201cI was determined to vote,\u201d said Jarrett, 38. \u201cOur whole community was galvanized by Stacey Abrams\u2019 campaign. But some people came in, saw the line, and walked right back out.\u201d\n\nOthers also tried to persuade people to be patient, attempting to counter frustration with a festive atmosphere. A band arrived and played music. Dozens of pizzas and refreshments appeared. When the rain broke, the sizzle of a grill began in the parking lot.\n\nJackson took selfies to try to lift spirits. He also went to a playbook that has worked for him since the civil rights movement: He mobilized the press and created a scene. Soon, five brand new machines, still in the wrapper, were brought to the concrete building on Garibaldi Street. But by then, some of the damage had already been done.\n\n\u201cSome people had to leave and go to work,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cSome had to go home and get their medicine. Some people became discouraged. Denial of opportunity, denial of access to democracy ... That\u2019s what voter suppression looks like. I\u2019ve seen this for a long time.\u201d\n\nVoters in other black neighborhoods complained of long lines and inadequate resources, too. As the hour drew near for the polls to close, the Georgia NAACP won its lawsuit to extend voting hours for three precincts in Fulton County, including Pittman Park. When the lights were turned off after the last ballot was cast, it was 1 a.m., according to workers at the center.\n\nNearly a week after the election, even those who were able to vote are left wondering whether they were excluded from the process, despite their perseverance. The fight continues, as Abrams has sued a southwest Georgia county over absentee ballots and has vowed to stay in the race until the recount is complete.\n\n\u201cI think she probably did win, but I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll be the governor, because I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll do the right thing,\u201d Jarrett said of Abrams. \u201cIt\u2019s a damn shame, because people really came out. For their votes not to be counted ... it\u2019s like a disgrace to democracy.\u201d\n\n___\n\nWhack is The Associated Press\u2019 national writer on race and ethnicity.

Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nErick Allen, a black Democrat newly elected to the Georgia House, said allegations of voter suppression and questions about Election Day problems could dog Kemp as governor if he ultimately prevails.\n\n\u201cThe erosion in trust is done,\u201d said Allen.\n\nAbrams is seeking to become the first black woman elected governor in the United States, while Kemp is attempting to continue GOP dominance in a diversifying state that could be a battleground in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nOn Saturday, she released a statement that she had met with voters who experienced difficulties casting ballots. She said her campaign had heard stories of voters turned away from the polls, students and military members who requested absentee ballots that never arrived or were \u201clost in the mail\u201d \u2014 and first-time and longtime voters who found their names were \u201cno longer on the list.\u201d\n\nShe vowed to continue to fight.\n\n\u201cI am fighting to make sure our democracy works for and represents everyone who has ever put their faith in it.

The margin is enough for an outright Kemp victory if totals remain the same, but it\u2019s a tight race considering the large turnout. Abrams has argued that tens of thousands of provisional and military ballots need to be counted before the race is over.\n\nThe Kemp campaign said a maximum of 17,495 provisional and military ballots remain to be counted. The Abrams campaign contends at least 30,823 votes remain, including nearly 27,000 provisional ballots; that could be enough to prompt a recount.\n\nThe Associated Press has not declared a winner. AP will reassess the race Tuesday, the deadline for counties to certify election results to the state.\n\nAbrams\u2019 supporters and volunteers made a push to get people who cast provisional ballots on Tuesday to provide information required to count their ballots by a Friday deadline. It wasn\u2019t clear how many did so.\n\nThe Kemp campaign said it didn\u2019t matter because there were far too few outstanding ballots for Abrams to erase his lead.\n\nThe Abrams campaign attempted to reserve television advertising time in case she makes it into a runoff with Kemp that would be held Dec. 4, but Atlanta TV station WSB said it wouldn\u2019t accept any commercials until votes are certified.\n\nAfter each of Georgia\u2019s 159 counties certifies final returns by Tuesday, the state must certify a statewide result by Nov. 20.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "SAN LUIS OBISPO, Calif.

(Melissa Sue Gerrits/The Fayetteville Observer via AP)\n\nFAYETTEVILLE, N.C. (AP) \u2014 Through a one-man show he recently staged at a New York play festival, Terry Sanford High School theater teacher Brian Mayers hopes to help break the cycle of crime and hopelessness.\n\nTitled \u201cThe Cycle,\u201d the play centers on three men in various states of violence, despair and addiction. It was staged last month at the United Solo Theatre Festival, directed by Mayers\u2019 wife, Toni Henderson-Mayers.\n\nAnd despite the bleak themes presented, there is a message of hope, which the playwright said he tries to convey in all of his work.\n\n\u201cI write for the lesser,\u201d said Mayers, 55. \u201cAnybody that\u2019s bullied, anybody that\u2019s been abused, neglected \u2014 the lesser.\u201d\n\nMayers, who is from Newark, New Jersey, is in his first year teaching at Terry Sanford. Before that, he worked in the business office at Fayetteville State University, he said.\n\nLocal theatergoers may be familiar with his work \u2014 he performed in Cape Fear Regional Theatre\u2019s \u201cOthello\u201d and \u201cThe Night of January 16th.\u201d And, for more than a decade, Mayers has played the part of Jacob Marley in the annual downtown Fayetteville Dickens Festival held the day after Thanksgiving.\n\nBut Mayers said he gets the most satisfaction from writing.\n\n\u201cI love writing.

I dream of the day I can just write.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Cycle,\u201d which Mayers performs himself, centers on three men.\n\nOne, named Pink Pickle Pin Peterson III, is a chronic alcoholic. Another, named Saleek Saleem Ali-Mean Ali-Brak, is a heroin-addicted pimp. The third is a young man in prison nicknamed Rob Steal.\n\nThrough each of the characters, Mayers weaves a theme of the importance of having a strong father figure in the family unit, and conveys a Christian perspective, he said.\n\n\u201cThis is about fatherlessness and when the father\u2019s not in the home, how devastating that can be,\u201d Mayers said.\n\nBefore the play was accepted at the United Solo Theatre Festival, Mayers said he staged it at juvenile detention facilities in New Jersey.\n\nHe remembers putting the play on for an audience of Crips, Bloods and other gang members who laughed at some of the dark characterizations. When he asked them why at a question-and-answer session after the play, they told him they had seen just as bad or worse behavior in their own lives.\n\nMayers drew from some of his experiences for the play, which he wrote in 2004. He said in 2001, he was falsely imprisoned in a case of mistaken identity when he lived in Pennsylvania and spent weeks in jail before he could clear his name.\n\nThe harrowing experience taught him about life in prison and the intricacies of the legal system.\n\n\u201cI went to court eight times.

He moved to Fayetteville in 2006 after finding a job here as a teacher\u2019s assistant.\n\nWhile he loves teaching and the impact he has on young people, Mayers said he finds a unique avenue for expression in writing.\n\n\u201cI always say writing is my pulpit,\u201d he said. \u201cI have so many stories I want to share with other people, because you don\u2019t know what that person is going through.\u201d\n\nMayers said the hour-long \u201cThe Cycle\u201d was well received at the United Solo Theatre Festival, where he said about 120 one-man plays were performed over a seven-week period.\n\n\u201cI had to come back twice to do curtain calls,\u201d he said.\n\nStaged on 42nd Street in New York\u2019s theater district, United Solo\u2019s goal is to present original, one-person works that \u201creflect upon political, sexual, economical, religious and social diversity,\u201d according to its website.

(Carl Juste/Miami Herald via AP)\n\nFORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Mishaps, protests and litigation dominated Florida\u2019s first day of recounting the vote for pivotal races for governor and Senate, bringing back memories of the 2000 presidential fiasco.\n\nMuch of the drama on Sunday centered on Broward and Palm Beach counties, home to large concentrations of Democratic voters.\n\nIn Broward County, the recount was delayed for several hours Sunday morning because of a problem with one of the tabulation machines. That prompted the Republican Party to slam Broward\u2019s supervisor of elections, Brenda Snipes, for \u201cincompetence and gross mismanagement.\u201d\n\nBroward officials faced further headaches after they acknowledged the county mistakenly counted 22 absentee ballots that had been rejected. The problem seemed impossible to fix because the dismissed ballots were mixed in with 205 legal ballots and Snipes said it would be unfair to throw out all of those votes.\n\nBy the end of the day, Gov. Rick Scott, the Republican candidate for Senate, filed suit against Snipes in a circuit court. He sought a judge\u2019s order that law enforcement agents impound and secure all voting machines, tallying devices and ballots \u201cwhen not in use until such time as any recounts.\u201d The lawsuit accused Snipes of repeatedly failing to account for the number of ballots left to be counted and failing to report results regularly as required by law.\n\nThe recounting of Senate and gubernatorial ballots is underway in Florida's second most-populous county after it fixed problems with its machines. (Nov. 11)\n\nJuan Penalosa, the executive director of the Florida Democratic Party, accused Scott of \u201cusing his position to consolidate power by cutting at the very core of our democracy.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, in Palm Beach County, the supervisor of elections said she doesn\u2019t believe her department will be able to meet the state\u2019s Thursday deadline to complete the recount, throwing into question what would happen to votes there.\n\nThe developments added up to a tumultuous day in America\u2019s premier political battleground state. More than half of Florida\u2019s 67 counties began a recount process that\u2019s unprecedented even in a state notorious for settling elections by razor-thin margins. State officials said they weren\u2019t aware of any other time a race for governor or U.S. Senate required a recount, let alone both in the same election.\n\nThe recount in other major population centers, including Miami-Dade and Pinellas and Hillsborough counties in the Tampa Bay area, was ongoing without incident Sunday. Smaller counties are expected to begin their reviews in coming days.\n\nUnofficial results showed Republican former U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis led Democratic Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum by 0.41 percentage points in the election for governor. In the Senate race, Scott\u2019s lead over Democratic incumbent Bill Nelson was 0.14 percentage points.\n\nState law requires a machine recount in races where the margin is less than 0.5 percentage points. Once completed, if the differences in any of the races are 0.25 percentage points or below, a hand recount will be ordered.\n\nAs the recount unfolded, Republicans urged their Democratic opponents to give up and let the state to move on. Scott said Sunday that Nelson wants fraudulent ballots and those cast by noncitizens to count, pointing to a Nelson lawyer objecting to Palm Beach County\u2019s rejection of one provisional ballot because it was cast by a noncitizen.\n\n\u201cHe is trying to commit fraud to win this election,\u201d Scott told Fox News. \u201cBill Nelson\u2019s a sore loser. He\u2019s been in politics way too long.\u201d\n\nNelson\u2019s campaign issued a statement Sunday saying their lawyer wasn\u2019t authorized to object to the ballot\u2019s rejection as \u201cNon-citizens cannot vote in US elections.\u201d\n\nIn Fort Lauderdale, Gillum appeared at a predominantly African-American church Sunday evening, telling an overflow crowd that voter disenfranchisement isn\u2019t just about being blocked from the polling booth. He said it also includes absentee ballots not being counted and ballots where \u201cthe \u2018w\u2019 in their signature may look different today than the \u2018w\u2019 in their signature yesterday, that a volunteer may have the option of looking at that ballot and deciding that vote is null and void.\u201d\n\nThe fact that Trump and Scott \u201care fighting like you know what to stop the vote count, that ought to tell you something,\u201d Gillum said. \u201cThey don\u2019t get to shut down the process because they\u2019re not winning.\u201d\n\nGillum and Nelson have argued each vote should be counted and the process should take its course. Both the state elections division, which Scott runs, and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement have said they have found no evidence of voter fraud.\n\nThat didn\u2019t stop protests outside Snipes\u2019 office, where a crowd of mostly Republicans gathered, holding signs, listening to country music and occasionally chanting \u201clock her up,\u201d referring to Snipes.\n\nA massive Trump 2020 flag flew over the parking lot and many members of a Bikers For Trump group wore matching shirts and carried flags, mingling among a crowd that included a protester wearing a Hillary Clinton mask.\n\nRegistered independent Russell Liddick, a 38-year-old retail worker from Pompano Beach, carried a sign reading, \u201cI\u2019m not here for Trump! I\u2019m here for fair elections! Fire Snipes!\u201d He said the office\u2019s problems \u201cdon\u2019t make me feel very much like my vote counted.\u201d\n\nFlorida is also conducting a recount in a third statewide race. Democrat Nikki Fried had a 0.07 percentage point lead over Republican state Rep. Matt Caldwell in the race for agriculture commissioner, one of Florida\u2019s three Cabinet seats.\n\nThe recounts might dredge up memories of the 2000 presidential recount, when it took more than five weeks for Florida to declare George W. Bush the victor over Vice President Al Gore by 537 votes, thus giving Bush the presidency.\n\nBut much has changed since. In 2000, each county had its own voting system. Many used punch cards \u2014 voters poked out chads, leaving tiny holes in their ballots representing their candidates. Some voters, however, didn\u2019t fully punch out the presidential chad or gave it just a little push. Those hanging and dimpled chads had to be examined by the canvassing boards, a lengthy, tiresome and often subjective process that became fodder for late-night comedians.\n\nNow the state requires all Florida counties use ballots where voters use a pen to mark their candidate\u2019s name, much like a student does when taking a multiple-choice test. And how counts proceed is now clearly spelled out.\n\nThose ballots are now being run through scanning machines in each county for a second time under the watchful eye of representatives of both parties and the campaigns. Any ballot that cannot be read for any of the recounted races will be put aside.\n\n___\n\nAP writers Tamara Lush in St. Petersburg and Brendan Farrington in Tallahassee contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "NEWNAN, Ga. (AP) \u2014 Tai chi is becoming a new favorite exercise among Parkinson\u2019s patients like Larry Bergeson of Newnan.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had two trial lessons,\u201d he said. \u201cTai chi is great for learning movement and balance. As a person affected by Parkinson\u2019s disease, both movement and balance become more difficult as the disease progresses.\u201d\n\nBergeson also heads up the local Parkinson\u2019s support group. He invited Trish Gurney, a therapist with the First Hands organization of Peachtree City and tai chi teacher, to lead an exercise class during one of the support group\u2019s meetings.\n\n\u201cThe great thing about tai chi is it can be done standing, holding onto a chair or sitting,\u201d Gurney explained. \u201cA lot of people with Parkinson\u2019s disease lose control of balance in their lower extremities. Tai chi teaches them to move from their center of gravity which is three fingers below the belly button. It brings their focus down, helps them align their bodies in a straight line and gives them good posture.\n\nAccording to Gurney, Parkinson\u2019s patients who take tai chi classes for at least a year have less tendency to fall.\n\nFalling to the ground can be just one outcome for patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease.\n\nAccording to the Parkinson\u2019s Foundation website, the disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that predominantly affects dopamine-producing neurons in a specific area of the brain.\n\nAround 60,000 Americans are diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s disease each year, according to www.parkinsonassociation.org.\n\nIt is estimated between 7-10 million people worldwide are currently living with the disease. Unfortunately, researchers do not know what causes Parkinson\u2019s disease, and there is no cure.\n\nSymptoms generally develop slowly over years. The disease affects everyone differently, but indicators include tremors, slowness of movements, rigid limbs and balance issues, according to the Parkinson\u2019s Foundation.\n\nParkinson\u2019s disease affects a person\u2019s cognition, or mental abilities used to process information and apply knowledge, according to www.apdaparkinson.org. This includes functions that allow people to estimate distance and depth perception, which is why Parkinson\u2019s patients may have trouble walking, turning around, reaching for objects and even walking backwards.\n\nThe lack of coordination, vertigo, loss of muscle tone, and issues with depth perception are another set of potential problems for patients living with Parkinson\u2019s disease, said Dr. Amy Morse, a physical therapist with Neuro Rehab Clinic at the Emory Brain Health Center.\n\nAccording to Gurney, tai chi can help with those health issues as well.\n\n\u201cTai chi teaches Parkinson\u2019s patients to keep their joints loose,\u201d she explained. \u201cThere are exercises we can do that create a long \u2018form,\u2019 or segue into more choreographed movements, which is great for the patients\u2019 mental state as they memorize the movements.\n\n\u201cI teach them ways to refine the movements and still keep the integrity of it,\u201d Gurney added.\n\nGurney has taught tai chi classes for people with all ranges of abilities for 21 years, she said.\n\nGurney is also a master of Emei Qigong, she said.\n\nSimilar to tai chi, Emei Qigong is a Chinese martial arts aimed at promoting good health, emotional balance and spiritual awareness through practices that strengthen the body\u2019s vital energy. The meditative exercise also reportedly deepens people\u2019s healing ability, according to the emeiqigong.us website.\n\n\u201cPeople with Parkinson\u2019s disease have to envision a move before they do it, such as getting up from a chair,\u201d she explained. \u201cIt can be done if their foot is positioned in the right place and they are sitting up correctly.\n\n\u201cTai chi also teaches patients to keep their knees bent, which strengthens their quad muscles,\u201d Gurney added. \u201cHaving strong quad muscles is what gets you out of a chair or off of a toilet.\u201d\n\nBut most importantly, patients need to have an open mind, Gurney said.\n\nTai chi and other martial arts are a form of eastern holistic medicine that Gurney believes has not been fully embraced by the \u201cwestern civilization\u201d as a means of healing.\n\nBut Gurney said so far, she\u2019s had a good response among people she\u2019s taught.\n\n\u201cTai chi is still a foreign idea, but more people are becoming enthusiastic about the class,\u201d she said. \u201cI have seen Parkinson\u2019s patients more eager to move. That alone is good. If they don\u2019t move, their muscles and joints will seize up.\n\n\u201cI believe tai chi is utilizing everything they\u2019ve got,\u201d Gurney added. \u201cIt\u2019s keeping them alert, focused and happy. It\u2019s keeping them flexible to learning and to always keep moving. But the exercise is also very meditative for them too.\u201d\n\nGurney\u2019s tai chi classes have made a believer out of Bergeson.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a well-known fact the way to slow Parkinson\u2019s disease is to keep moving, which includes exercises,\u201d he said. \u201cTai chi helps to meet that need, and Trish is an excellent teacher. She is patient and caring. She was so well-received, we invited her to come back.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Times-Herald, http://www.times-herald.com", "JAMESTOWN, S.C. (AP) \u2014 To many people, this tiny community in the northeastern part of Berkeley County is simply a place to slow down as they pass through on their way somewhere else.\n\nHeading into town on densely wooded S.C. Highways 41 or 45, the speed limit drops from 55 mph to 40.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t think you\u2019ll get a ticket, just sail through here,\u201d said Craig Bellamy, who lives in nearby Alvin but comes here to get his hair cut at Nancelle\u2019s Hair Place. \u201cThe speed limit is 40, but that means 39\u00bd.\u201d\n\nIf you blink, you could miss Jamestown, one of South Carolina\u2019s 10 smallest municipalities by population. At a little less than 1 square mile, the town has no historic street lined with stores, offices, restaurants or theaters.\n\nIts claim to fame is the annual Hell Hole Swamp Festival, held each May as a nod to the area\u2019s history of hiding moonshiners. Among the festival\u2019s activities is a children\u2019s tobacco spitting contest.\n\nThe festival is held in the center of town, where Highways 41 and 45 cross under a blinking caution light and stop signs. U.S. Highway 17A comes into town on Highway 45 from the west and leaves on 41 going north, often carrying people heading to or from Myrtle Beach.\n\nOn one corner is a convenience store-gas station that has the only fast-food restaurant in town, Subway.\n\nIt\u2019s a bustling place where locals and travelers often stop to fill their tanks, get a cold drink or a snack or use the restroom.\n\nMost mornings, a handful of local men gather with their cups of coffee to chat and watch the traffic go by.\n\nAccording to longtime Mayor Roy Pipkin, 8,000 cars and trucks a day \u2014 nearly 3 million a year \u2014 pass through Jamestown.\n\nAs far back as 1968, the town had a reputation as a speed trap, according to news accounts of the day. At the time, Mayor J.Y. Clark said the town\u2019s only police officer was just enforcing the law.\n\nSo now, who could blame Police Chief John High if his officers \u2014 one full-time and two part-time, in addition to him \u2014 spend their days on the lookout for speeders? They\u2019re breaking the law, and there\u2019s not much else for the officers to do.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have much crime,\u201d said Pipkin, 69. \u201cAbout 90 percent of the crime that\u2019s committed in town, they solve.\u201d\n\nMost cases involve shoplifting at the convenience store or equipment theft from the Charleston Heart Pine Co., he said.\n\nThe biggest nuisance recently has been feral hogs tearing up farmland. About 170 have been killed in the past two years, Pipkin said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got them just about gone now, but they\u2019re good for nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can eat them, I guess, but I don\u2019t like them. They taste earthy to me.\u201d\n\n\u2018I\u2019m not bored at all\u2019\n\nThe bucolic community on the edge of the 258,000-acre Francis Marion National Forest, not far from the Santee River, offers a very different lifestyle from the other side of the county, where three mega-communities \u2014 Nexton, Cane Bay and Carnes Crossroads \u2014 are expected to house more than 75,000 residents in the coming years.\n\nJamestown had 72 residents in 2010. By last year, that increased to 80, according to Census Bureau estimates. Pipkin likes to round it off at an even 100 because people move in and out, he said. There are 46 registered voters.\n\nThe mayor guesses he knows most folks, but his wife, Chris, knows everybody, he said. She\u2019s the town clerk, hired as a temporary fill-in 20 years ago to handle the day-to-day business, so she deals with the public regularly.\n\nOfficially, town hall hours are 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. Monday through Thursday. The mayor checks in daily but doesn\u2019t keep regular office hours. He spends most days tending his 150-acre tree farm or at his 75-acre tract by the Santee River.\n\nIt\u2019s part of the laid-back life that is Jamestown.\n\n\u201cThis is where I\u2019ll be till I die,\u201d said Clay Mau, who bought 28 acres here in 1991 while he was in the Army. After he retired in 1999, he and his wife first moved to a condo in Mount Pleasant.\n\n\u201cIt was a nice place, but I just don\u2019t like living in close quarters where you can hear people breathing next door,\u201d he said. \u201cI like the ability to go out and enjoy peace and quiet, listen to nature. I feel safer out in the country than I do in the city.\u201d\n\nMau spent about 10 years piddling in his workshop, sometimes laying stone or tile for friends, he said. Then he took a job in the town\u2019s water department as a jack-of-all-trades, doing everything from pump repair to collecting payments.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not bored out here at all,\u201d he said. \u201cYou would think you would be bored, but I\u2019m really not.\u201d\n\n\u2018Nobody came to the meetings\u2019\n\nPipkin, who was then the mayor pro-tem, stepped into the town leadership role more than 20 years ago when his predecessor quit. The job carries a whopping $350 annual salary, $50 more than each of the four council members make.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve spent more money in gasoline going to different events than I make as mayor,\u201d he said.\n\nThe town hasn\u2019t had an election in years because there were only as many candidates running as there were open seats, so the elections were called off. (A new state law will change that next year).\n\nPipkin, who is retired from the National Guard, grew up in Jamestown and lived there all of his life except for about eight years.\n\n\u201cI got the mayor\u2019s job by default, and I\u2019ve been here ever since because I wanted to help the little town out. Charleston, Goose Creek and all those guys, they got grant writers and they apply for grants and all this stuff. Well, this is the grant writer here,\u201d he said, pointing to himself. \u201cI have to do it all. (Charleston Mayor John) Tecklenburg, he don\u2019t have to write a grant. He just tells somebody, \u2018I want it,\u2019 and they do it for him.\u201d\n\nPipkin has worked hard to keep the town independent.\n\nDuring his tenure, Jamestown, which has an annual budget of $$284,000, has secured about $6 million to put in waterlines and recreational facilities.\n\nThe town has its own municipal court, where those speeding tickets are handled, along with cases of abandoned houses that Pipkin wants fixed or removed.\n\nWhen Berkeley County closed the Jamestown branch library years ago, the town took over its operation, moving the books to a small room in a utility building next to town hall.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t get much business,\u201d Pipkin said. \u201cWe stayed open five or six years, but now it\u2019s basically on demand. We\u2019ve got computers in there and the kids around here who don\u2019t have a computer, they know to come in here and get a key.\u201d\n\nPipkin has tried unsuccessfully a couple of times to grow the town by annexation. One attempt lost by three votes \u2014 and the three people who wanted to be annexed didn\u2019t vote, he said.\n\n\u201cI tell people, if you become a member of the town, you\u2019ve got a whole lot bigger voice than in Berkeley County,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you need something done, instead of going to County Council, which represents the whole county, you can come here, and file your complaint or your whatever and get things done.\u201d\n\nSince the volunteer fire department phased out, the town relies on the county for fire protection and EMS. Those stations are about a mile outside of town limits.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve still got our old truck and I tried to re-establish the fire department, but nobody came to the meetings,\u201d the mayor said. It would probably be too costly to run a department anyway, he added.\n\nResidents haul their garbage to one of two county convenience centers about 5 miles outside of town.\n\nStudents are bused 12 to 15 miles to Bonner Elementary, Macedonia Middle and Timberland High.\n\nInconviences? Yes, but...\n\nPipkin\u2019s big news is that Jamestown is getting a Dollar General across from the gas station at the intersection.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to get one of those for seven years,\u201d he said. \u201cI guess they got tired of me talking to them every three months.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be good for the community. A lot of the people around here, they don\u2019t have cars. If we have Dollar General here, they can walk there and walk back.\u201d\n\nThe dearth of businesses is something that has happened over time as people moved to bigger cities.\n\nIn the mid-1950s, Jamestown had a grocery store and a drug store, and its population hovered around 250, media reports remember.\n\nGrocer A.B. Bishop led a charge to bring telephones to the town, with one of the first installed in his store in January 1955. It was part of an effort to attract a French wool scouring plant, now Chargeurs Wool USA, which is right outside of town limits and today employs 60 people.\n\nJessica Timmons rings up customers in her Jamestown restaurant, Aces, named after her nickname for her children Tuesday, Oct. 23, 2018. Timmons, an Army veteran, returned to her hometown of Jamestown to open the small town\u2019s only restaurant. Grace Beahm Alford/Staff\n\n\u201cWhen I was growing up, there was a lot of things here,\u201d said Jessica Timmons, 36. \u201cThere was a restaurant, a meat market, a lot of businesses.\u201d\n\nShe remembers walking to Pipkin\u2019s Store with $1 in her pocket, and coming out with 100 pieces of candy.\n\nIn December 2016, Timmons, a single mother of three, opened Ace\u2019s Social Club, the town\u2019s only restaurant, in a vacant building near the railroad tracks.\n\n\u201cPeople had to drive so far to get something to eat,\u201d she said. \u201cI wanted to bring convenience to my hometown.\u201d\n\nShe opens at 5:30 a.m. and serves bacon, eggs, grits and breakfast sandwiches to many truck drivers passing through town. She offers burgers, wings and fish for lunch and manager\u2019s specials for dinner. On the weekends, she shows sports on the wall-mounted TV \u201cso the people in the community can enjoy coming here and they don\u2019t have to drive so far.\u201d\n\nDriving is part of life when you live so far out in the country.\n\nJamestown has few job opportunities. There\u2019s the flooring company, the wool factory and the Martin Marietta Georgetown Quarry, just over 2 miles outside town. But most of Jamestown\u2019s working class commute to Moncks Corner, Georgetown, Mount Pleasant or Charleston. Many log 100 miles roundtrip each day.\n\nGrocery shopping, doctor\u2019s appointments and fine dining all also require hours-long road trips.\n\n\u201cIt takes planning,\u201d Mau said. \u201cYou try to make as many stops as possible. If I need to go somewhere, I try to hold off until I need to go to a couple other places. I don\u2019t really want to waste the gas or the time unless I have more than one thing to do.\u201d\n\nThere are inconveniences, to be sure. But they\u2019re worth it.\n\n\u201cI used to not like to live in Jamestown because there\u2019s nothing to do,\u201d Pipkin said. \u201cBut the older I get, the more I like it. You can go outside at night and actually see stars. When I lived in Columbia, you never saw a star.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Post and Courier, http://www.postandcourier.com", "Spaine Edler never expected to be known for his humorous depictions of south Louisiana culture.\n\nBut it seems only natural since his father wrote, illustrated and published children\u2019s books under the moniker the Louisiana Crawfish-Man.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been somewhat of a class clown,\u201d Edler says. \u201cWhen I see people laugh and smile, it makes me feel good.

His parents knew that eventually, he would need a transplant.\n\n\u201cCollin is now a different kid, full of life,\u201d said Karen Berg, mother and a registered nurse who works in outpatient surgery for Ochsner Hospital. \u201cBefore the transplant, he was so sick and so tired all the time. He would throw up and had headaches. It was overwhelming.\u201d\n\nOn Jan. 31, 2017, Berg and his mother, Karen, underwent surgery. Doctors removed one of Karen\u2019s kidneys and transplanted it into her son.\n\nKaren recalled that Collin was born premature at 32 weeks by an emergency C-section because she had no amniotic fluid.\n\n\u201cCollin spent the first 3.5 weeks of his life in the NICU, but wasn\u2019t diagnosed until he was 6 months old with autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease. ARPKD is a rare disease that affects 1 in 20,000 children worldwide. My husband and I are both carriers of the gene and little did we know, we had a 1:4 chance of having a child with PKD.\u201d\n\nThroughout his younger years, Berg was given dozens of medications and multiple surgeries to help relieve and maintain functioning of his enlarged kidneys and other vital organs.\n\n\u201cCollin\u2019s native kidneys are the size of footballs,\u201d said Karen, recognized as the first living donor of a kidney at Tulane Lakeside Hospital. \u201cHis liver and spleen are also enlarged. Over the next 12 years or so, we managed his high blood pressure with oral medications.\n\n\u201cCollin has always been a champ about taking his meds. I can remember giving him his liquid meds when he was just an infant, even giving them to him while he was asleep. He would just open his mouth and take his liquid medication and continue on sleeping. Still to this day, when it\u2019s time for his meds, he is on it without hesitation.\u201d\n\nAlongside his mother, Collin was the first recipient of a kidney from a living donor at Tulane Lakeside Hospital in Metairie. Upon completion of the surgery, Karen remembers the agony of waiting to hear if the kidney transplant was successful.\n\n\u201cThe transplant seemed to go well, however, once they got him settled in the PICU, they could not detect any blood flow to the kidney so he was rushed back to the OR to open up the graft to allow blood flow to the newly transplanted kidney,\u201d Karen said.\n\n\u201cWe were told the following day that the kidney took a big hit and that the kidney would more than likely need to be removed because of the lack of blood supply. The kidney appeared black. We prayed. Collin underwent dialysis three times in the hospital while we waited for the kidney to wake up.\u201d\n\nDuring this stressful time, Collin underwent several surgeries in an attempt to close his muscles in his abdomen.

What started out ten years ago as a day of online promotion with US$7.8million in sales has grown into the world's biggest e-commerce event generating US$25.3billion in 2017. (AP Photo/Ng Han Guan)\n\nSHANGHAI (AP) \u2014 Online shoppers spent more than $14 billion within the first two hours of China\u2019s annual buying frenzy on Sunday, once again breaking records as the consumer tradition enters its 10th year.\n\nThe spending binge breaks from gloomy forecasts about the world\u2019s second-largest economy, which is struggling with a tariff war with the U.S., a stock market slump and slowing overall growth.\n\nKnown as Singles Day, the clamor for deals and discounts was heralded with characteristic fanfare by Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, which has turned an unofficial holiday for people without romantic partners into a yearly windfall for digital retailers.\n\nA massive screen at Alibaba\u2019s gala in Shanghai showed the surging sales numbers in real time: At 2 minutes and 5 seconds after midnight, 10 billion yuan ($1.43 billion) in purchases had been made on Alibaba\u2019s platforms. By the 1 hour and 47 minute mark, that number had increased tenfold.\n\nSingles Day began as a spoof event celebrated by unattached Chinese university students in the 1990s. In Chinese, it\u2019s called \u201cDouble 11,\u201d after the numbers in the month and date. The improvised holiday has since been co-opted by e-retailers and transformed into China\u2019s version of Cyber Monday \u2014 the busiest time for online shopping in the U.S.\n\nThe Twitter-like Weibo platform was blanketed with Singles Day-related posts on Sunday, from users proudly proclaiming that they had resisted the shopping urge this year to those who cheerfully listed an array of mundane purchases.\n\nAlibaba founder Jack Ma, who will step down as chairman in less than a year, attended the start of the gala in Shanghai and appeared in a video message in which he wrapped up live hair crabs, a popular online purchase.\n\nSingles Day \u201cis not a day of discounts, but rather a day of gratitude,\u201d Ma said in the video. \u201cIt\u2019s when retailers use the best products and best prices to show their gratitude to our consumers.\u201d\n\nChinese e-commerce platforms have come under fire in the past for peddling low-quality and counterfeit items. Hong Tao, an economics professor at Beijing Technology and Business University, said Singles Day encourages shoppers to prioritize cheap prices over high quality, causing them to purchase items they don\u2019t need.\n\n\u201cPeople are swept up in the festivities,\u201d Hong said in a phone interview. \u201cThis burst of consumption, confined to just one day, can be exhausting for both buyers and sellers.\u201d\n\nThe occasion also has big environmental implications.\n\nWhile both Alibaba and competitor JD.com have pledged to use biodegradable packaging to cut down on waste, research conducted this month by Greenpeace East Asia said many plastics marked \u201cbiodegradable\u201d and used by Chinese e-retailers can only break down under high temperatures in facilities that are limited in number across the country.\n\nGreenpeace estimated that by 2020, \u201cbiodegradable\u201d packaging could produce roughly 721 truckloads of trash in China every day.\n\n___\n\nWang reported from Beijing.", "Today in History\n\nToday is Sunday, Nov. 11, the 315th day of 2018.

We\u2019re already in field goal range,\u201d Longhorns coach Tom Herman said. \u201cIf we get one-on-one coverage, we\u2019re going to try for the win.\u201d\n\nWith Ehlinger\u2019s fourth TD pass, and second to Humphrey, the Longhorns (7-3, 5-2 Big 12) snapped a two-game skid that had cost them the Big 12 lead. They stayed a game behind co-leaders No. 6 Oklahoma and No. 7 West Virginia with two games left to determine who plays in the conference championship game Dec. 1.\n\nNext up for the Longhorns is No. 23 Iowa State, the team they are tied with for third place.\n\n\u201cTo battle back like we did, after a heartbreaking loss on a two-point conversion, will certainly pay dividends in the overall confidence of this team,\u201d Herman said, referring to the 42-41 home loss a week earlier when Mountaineers quarterback Will Grier ran for the 2-pointer in the final minute.\n\nTexas went 75 yards in seven plays for the winning score at Texas Tech (5-5, 3-4), whose 17 consecutive points in just over 5 1/2 minutes included recovering an onside kick. The Red Raiders tied the game on Jett Duffey\u2019s fourth TD pass, a 9-yarder to Antoine Wesley with 1:45 left.\n\nEhlinger started the final drive with runs of 3 and 18 yards, then had a couple of short completions before a 12-yard run that set up his game-winning pass to Humphrey, who finished with eight catches for 159 yards.

Vasher, who had two TD catches for Tech. \u201cTexas played a pretty good game but we\u2019re never OK with a loss. So everybody\u2019s pretty upset right now.\u201d\n\nWesley had eight catches for 171 yards and two touchdowns for the Red Raiders, who lost their third game in a row.\n\nDuffey had 524 total yards in his second start in place of injured Alan Bowman, completing 37 of 47 passes for 444 yards and running 17 times for 80 yards. But he also had three crucial turnovers before the late comeback, throwing a pick near the end zone and fumbling twice on runs that ended inside the Texas 20.\n\n\u201cIt would have been easy to fold after that last fumble, but he competes his tail off,\u201d coach Kliff Kingsbury said. \u201cHe had a great look in his eye the entire time. ... He gave us a chance to win with his mental toughness there at the end and the way he competed.\u201d\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nTexas: The Longhorns were coming off consecutive losses by a combined four points. Their last four wins haven\u2019t been overwhelming \u2014 by a combined 21 points, with the win at Tech the largest margin in that span.\n\nTexas Tech: The Red Raiders missed a chance for consecutive wins over Texas for the first time in 20 years. As much as the win in the regular-season finale in Austin last year likely saved Kingsbury\u2019s job, and got them bowl eligible, this loss could cast doubt on his future again. The former Red Raiders quarterback is now 35-38 in his six seasons as coach, and they still need one more win to get to their 16th bowl since 2000.\n\nEHLINGER\u2019S RECORD STREAK\n\nEhlinger broke the Big 12 record for most consecutive passes without an interception. The sophomore extended his streak of passes without a pick to 280, breaking the mark of 273 set by former West Virginia quarterback Geno Smith.\n\nSTUFFED ON 4th DOWN\n\nWhen the Red Raiders tried to convert fourth-and-1 from their own 34 before halftime, Duffey was immediately stuffed and Texas needed only four plays before Keaontay Ingram\u2019s 2-yard TD run to go up 17-7.\n\nBOWMAN SITS OUT\n\nBowman had another four-night hospital stay after taking a hit in last week\u2019s 51-46 loss to Oklahoma, leading to a recurrence of a partially collapsed lung the standout true freshman initially suffered earlier this season.

(AP Photo/Elise Amendola)\n\nBOSTON (AP) \u2014 At the site of Dabo Swinney\u2019s first victory as the head coach of Clemson 10 years ago, the Tigers earned a milestone victory that shows what a superpower they have become.\n\nTrevor Lawrence threw a touchdown pass and ran for a score and No. 2 Clemson knocked Boston College quarterback Anthony Brown out of the game early on the way to routing the 17th-ranked Eagles 27-7 on Saturday night.\n\nThe battle for first-place in the ACC Atlantic Division was not much of a fight. The Tigers (10-0, 7-0, No. 2 CFP) wrapped up a record fourth straight trip to the Atlantic Coast Conference title game as division champions and kept rolling toward another College Football Playoff appearance.\n\n\u201cThis group has kind of made history all year,\u201d said Swinney, who was a little known receivers coach when he was promoted to head coach by Clemson in 2008, and won his first game Nov. 1 in Chestnut Hill.\n\nNow Clemson is among college football\u2019s elite. The current senior class has won 50 games, gone 23-1 in division play and 19-1 on the road.\n\nBoston College (7-3, 4-2, No. 17 CFP) lost Brown on its first possession when the sophomore got off a third-and-9 pass, but was thrown to the turf by star senior defensive tackle Christian Wilkins. Athletic trainers attended to Brown on the field and he walked to the sideline on his own. He wasn\u2019t there long before heading to the locker room. In the second quarter, it was announced he would not return.\n\nAfter the game BC coach Steve Addazio said Brown was hospitalized with an internal injury, but would not give specifics.\n\nWithout Brown, BC never threated Clemson\u2019s defense. But the Tigers let the Eagles hang around. BC\u2019s Michael Walker returned a punt 74 yards for a touchdown and Clemson stalled a couple times in the red zone. With 260 yards of offense, Clemson led only 13-7 at half.\n\nIt took six plays from scrimmage into the second half for the Tigers to build some cushion. Lawrence walked in for a 6-yard TD.\n\nBC backup quarterback EJ Perry was overmatched against one of the best defenses in the country. The sophomore is a better runner than passer, and Wilkins, Austin Bryant and Tanner Muse feasted against a limited attack. Clemson held BC star tailback AJ Dillon to 39 yards on 16 carries.\n\nThe Eagles managed 113 total yards and nine first downs.\n\n\u201cThis is a tough game to break into,\u201d Addazio said. \u201cEnd of the fourth quarter, it\u2019s 20-7 without our starting quarterback. You certainly don\u2019t want to play the likes of Clemson and lose your quarterback at the start of the game.\u201d\n\nLawrence was 29 for 40 for 295 yards, including a 2-yard TD pass in the first quarter to Milan Richard out of the Fridge Formation. With 350-pound defensive tackle Dexter Lawrence at fullback and the 315-pound Wilkins at tailback, Trevor Lawrence faked to Wilkins and flipped to Richard on fourth down to put Clemson up 10-7.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a threat,\u201d said Wilkins, who is from nearby Framingham, Massachusetts. \u201cI\u2019m in the scouting report.\u201d\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nClemson: The one nit to pick was the Tigers never got their running game really cranked up, but a 58-yard punt return touchdown by Amari Rodgers early in the fourth quarter eliminated any possibility for drama.\n\nBoston College: The Eagles\u2019 biggest home game in years featured a sellout crowd of 44,500, sprinkled with Clemson orange, and ESPN\u2019s \u201cCollege GameDay\u201d on campus for the first time since 2009. The crowd started building on campus for the pregame show by 5 a.m ., lining the \u201cMillion Dollar Stairs\u201d that connect the upper campus to the area around Alumni Stadium. The Eagles still have a chance to reach eight victories for the first time since 2009 and nine wins since 2008. But they might have to do it with the No. 2 quarterback.\n\n\u201cWe have all the faith in (Perry),\u201d BC defensive end Zach Allen said. \u201cI\u2019m excited for EJ.\u201d\n\nBAD ANNIVERSARY\n\nOne day short of a year ago, Brown blew out his knee against North Carolina State.\n\nLEATHER HELMET\n\nThe winner of the Clemson-BC games takes home the O\u2019Rourke-McFadden Trophy, named after two stars from the 1940 Cotton Bowl pitting the Eagles and Tigers. Trevor Lawrence earned the black leather helmet that goes to the MVP.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nClemson: The Tigers return home to finish the season against Duke and then South Carolina.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting to kind of that championship time. Just getting ready to make that push,\u201d said Clemson receiver Hunter Renfrow, who set a school record with a catch in 38 consecutive games.\n\nBoston College: The Eagles go to Florida State next week.\n\n___\n\nFollow Ralph D.

(AP Photo/Paul Sancya)\n\nSOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) \u2014 On Senior Night at frosty Notre Dame Stadium, coach Brian Kelly couldn\u2019t have been happier for senior quarterback Brandon Wimbush in No. 3 Notre Dame\u2019s 42-13 victory over Florida State.\n\n\u201cBrandon wants to win for Notre Dame, for his teammates,\u201d Kelly said after the senior backup threw three first-half touchdowns and fellow senior Dexter Williams ran for a career-high 202 yards while the Irish (10-0, No. 3 CFP) took advantage of two first-quarter turnovers by the Seminoles\n\n\u201cBrandon has been that way whether in a starting role or as a backup,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cHe led our football team when we needed him. It\u2019s not an individual game but he had a big hand in it.\u201d\n\nWimbush, who led the Irish to their first three victories, got the start in place of injured junior Ian Book, who suffered a rib injury last week against Northwestern.\n\nWimbush finished 12 of 25 for 130 yards with the scoring passes to fellow seniors - a 3-yarder to wide receiver Miles Boykin and 6- and 15-yard tosses to tight end Alize Mack.\n\n\u201cIt was really emotional,\u201d Wimbush said. \u201cThe six weeks were tough, but they were inspiring. The first half was one of the best I think the team has had. It felt natural. We got off to a great start.\u201d\n\nWith the temperature at 27 degrees \u2014 the third-coldest game at Notre Dame Stadium since the 1980 season \u2014 the Irish wore green jerseys for the fourth time in Kelly\u2019s nine-year tenure at Notre Dame to honor their seniors.\n\nWilliams, who sat out the first four games of his senior season because of a university-imposed suspension, piled up the 202 yards on 20 carries, including TD runs of 58 and 32 yards, as Notre Dame outgained Florida State, 495-322, including 365 on the ground.\n\n\u201cThe offensive line came out with the fight,\u201d Williams said. \u201cI told them to keep pushing and I\u2019m going to do what I have to do. I just told them to give me a crease and I would make a couple runs for them.\u201d\n\nWimbush, however, did throw a pair of second-half interceptions that allowed coach Willie Taggart\u2019s Seminoles (4-6) to stay around after the Irish had taken a 32-6 halftime lead.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to start fast,\u201d Taggart said. \u201cWe made mistakes. Against a good football team, you can\u2019t do that. We\u2019re not stopping the run. It hurts you mentally.\u201d\n\nCam Akers had two touchdown runs for Florida State, his second on a 7-yard run following Stanford Samuels\u2019 interception early in the third quarter.\n\nBut Notre Dame\u2019s defense denied points after Dontavious Jackson\u2019s third-quarter theft when senior Drue Tranquill and junior Khalid Kareem made stops after the Seminoles had reached the Irish 1. On fourth down, quarterback Deondre Francois (23-47, 216 yards) threw incomplete.\n\nThe Seminoles, who practiced in summer-like conditions in Tallahassee before flying into wintry South Bend, saw Francois\u2019 second pass of the game intercepted by senior Nick Coleman and Akers\u2019 fumble recovered by junior Daelin Hayes. The Irish converted them into 10 points while taking a 17-0 first-quarter lead.\n\nTAKEAWAYS\n\nFlorida State: The Seminoles were their own worst enemy in the first half, surrendering 10 points after a pair of turnovers in the first quarter and another two points on Julian Love\u2019s return of a blocked conversion attempt in the second quarter. FSU\u2019s defense, which entered the game allowing just 111.1 yards per game (17th nationally), surrendered 141 yards in the first 30 minutes, 58 on Williams\u2019 touchdown run.\n\n\u201cMental toughness, discipline and execution,\u201d Taggart said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t execute when we had the chance. On defense, we gave up too many explosive plays.\u201d\n\nNotre Dame: Notre Dame\u2019s tall senior receivers dominated the banged-up Florida State secondary with three acrobatic TD catches in the first half. First, the 6-foot-4 Boykin outleaped his defender on a nicely thrown Wimbush pass. Later, the 6-foot-4\u00be Mack kept one foot inbounds to give the Irish a 14-0 lead and then outleaped an FSU defender for a 15-yard TD in the second quarter that sent the Irish in at halftime up 32-6.\n\nWIMBUSH SALUTED BY TEAMMATES\n\nWimbush threw just one touchdown pass and had four interceptions while leading the Irish to a 3-0 start before Kelly and offensive coordinator Chip Long opted to change to Book, who has thrown for 1,811 yards and 14 TDs since.\n\n\u201cIf any of you guys know Brandon, he\u2019s a high quality guy,\u201d defensive end Daelin Hayes said. \u201cWe as a defense wanted to emphasize that we had his back.\u201d\n\nBook is expected to be back at No. 1 for next Saturday afternoon\u2019s visit to Yankee Stadium and a showdown with No. 13 Syracuse.\n\nIN THE RUNNING\n\nWith Williams running for a career-high of 202 yards on 20 carries and touchdown runs of 58 and 32, the Irish exploded for a season-high 365. Their previous high was 272 against Stanford.\n\nNotre Dame, which entered the game averaging 181.0 yards rushing (53rd nationally, did not lose yardage on any of its 50 carries and it helped the Irish win the time of possession, 32-28 minutes. Notre Dame was also 9 of 16 on third-down conversions.\n\nWimbush\u2019s quick feet accounted for 68 yards on 12 carries, while Jafar Armstrong added 44 on seven rushes and Tony Jones Jr. scooted for 39 on six.\n\nIRISH 4-0 IN GREEN\n\nIt was Senior Night for the Irish, who came out in Kelly (pun intended) Green tops with blue numbers outlined in gold.\n\nIt\u2019s the fourth time during Kelly\u2019s nine seasons that the team has been in a shade of green. The Irish wore hunter-green jerseys against Army in Yankee Stadium during Kelly\u2019s inaugural season in 2010 (and won 27-3); wore all-green uniforms with blue and gold stripes against Boston College at Fenway Park in 2015 (and won 16-13); and wore an olive-green jersey against Army at the Alamodome in 2016 (and won 44-6).\n\nPrior to 1964, Notre Dame often wore green jerseys. Coach Dan Devine\u2019s 1977 team, quarterbacked by Joe Montana, came out in green jerseys after wearing blue tops in pregame warmups and then routed USC, 49-19. Notre Dame stayed in green afterward in its march to the national championship that season.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nFlorida State: Saturday at home against No. 17 Boston College.\n\nNotre Dame: Saturday at Yankee Stadium as the home team against No. 13 Syracuse.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "MILWAUKEE (AP) \u2014 Conner Avants scored 14 points on 6-of-9 shooting and Cortez Seales made two free throws with 13 seconds left to help North Dakota hold off Milwaukee for a 63-60 win on Saturday night.\n\nSeales finished with 12 points but shot just 4 of 18 from the field.

(AP) \u2014 Mike Conley and the Memphis Grizzlies added a bad ending to an emotional day for the Philadelphia 76ers.\n\nConley scored a season-high 32 points as the Grizzlies claimed a 112-106 overtime victory over the Sixers, who were short-handed and emotionally spent Saturday night after news broke earlier in the day that the team will trade starters Robert Covington and Dario Saric along with reserve Jerryd Bayless to Minnesota for All-Star Jimmy Butler.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of that feeling in your stomach of just like, I mean, you can\u2019t really explain it. I was in disbelief,\u201d said guard T.J. McConnell who had 16 points and seven assists.\n\nMcConnell\u2019s eight points in the fourth quarter helped Philadelphia hold a lead before the Sixers went to overtime for the second night in a row.\n\nDespite the Sixers being short-handed with none of the potentially traded players dressed for the game, it took a strong effort by Conley after halftime for Memphis to remain undefeated at home through five games at FedExForum.\n\nConley, who entered the game shooting 32 percent from the field in the last five games, converted 12 of 24 shots in the game. That included scoring 13 points in the third quarter, making 6 of 8 shots to help Memphis erase a Philadelphia lead that earlier had reached 16 points.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to lie,\u201d Conley said, \u201cThese whole last couple of weeks have been like just barely missing, barely not making shots, and missing shots I would normally make and feeling good while doing it.\u201d\n\nMarc Gasol scored 18 points and 12 rebounds, while Garrett Temple finished with 17 points, including a 3-pointer - after an offensive rebound by Gasol - with 39 seconds left in regulation to send the game into overtime tied at 102.

But I didn\u2019t feel it.\u201d\n\nAs for whether emotions of the changing teammates contributed, Redick said: \u201cI thought we played hard. Us playing back-to-back. Overtime games are tough.

(AP Photo/Michael Woods)\n\nFAYETTEVILLE, Ark. (AP) \u2014 Ed Orgeron could be heard screaming encouragement through the door of the LSU locker room following a 24-17 victory over Arkansas on Saturday night.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the prettiest of finishes to an otherwise dominant victory, but the coach of the No. 9 Tigers (8-2, 5-2 Southeastern Conference) was all about restoring a sense of swagger after a disheartening home loss to No. 1 Alabama a week ago.\n\nLed by Joe Burrow and a dominating defensive effort, LSU did just that while winning for the third straight time over the struggling Razorbacks (2-8, 0-6).\n\nBurrow was 15 of 21 for 195 yards and a touchdown, and the Tigers allowed only 91 yards of Arkansas offense through three quarters on their way to improving to 8-0 under Orgeron in games following a loss. The Tigers haven\u2019t lost back-to-back games since dropping three straight in 2015.\n\n\u201cIt was good to get on the plane, it was good to get out of Baton Rogue and come to a tough place to play,\u201d Orgeron said. \u201cAlthough it wasn\u2019t pretty, we won the football game and our guys feel good about themselves.\u201d\n\nJustin Jefferson had six catches for 117 yards, including a 40-yard touchdown for the game\u2019s first score. Nick Brossette added 90 yards rushing and a touchdown, but it was the LSU defense that set the tone early before allowing two fourth-quarter touchdowns.\n\n\u201cWe played LSU football,\u201d Tigers safety JaCoby Stevens said. \u201cCoach O wants us to play tough, mean and nasty, and that\u2019s what we did.\u201d\n\nThe Razorbacks managed a season-low 216 yards of total offense - including only 16 yards on the ground - while losing their ninth straight SEC game dating to last season. They are the only school in the SEC without a conference victory this season.\n\nTy Storey completed 19 of 38 passes for 200 yards and two touchdowns to tight end Cheyenne O\u2019Grady for Arkansas.\n\nThe Razorbacks have lost three straight to LSU and eight of their last nine games under first-year coach Chad Morris.\n\n\u201cWe knew they were an elite defense, and they definitely showed that,\u201d Morris said.\n\nArkansas trailed 24-3 in the fourth quarter before Storey connected on the two touchdown passes to O\u2019Grady \u2014 the second of which closed the LSU lead to 24-17 with 5:27 remaining.\n\nThe Tigers, however, closed out the win on offense by putting together a nine-play, 58-yard drive. Brossette had the final four rushes of the game and purposely fell down short of the goal line on his last two carries to ensure LSU was able to run out the clock and secure the much-needed bounce-back win.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nSo much for any lingering after effects from last week\u2019s loss to the Crimson Tide for LSU, at least defensively. The Tigers bested their previous best defensive effort of 254 total yards allowed, which they did against Southeastern Louisiana on Sept. 8. They forced Arkansas to punt on its first six possessions, and the only points LSU allowed in the first half came after a fumble that gave the Razorbacks the ball deep in Tigers\u2019 territory late in the half.\n\nARKANSAS TARGET\n\nRazorbacks defensive lineman Michael Taylor was called for targeting and ejected from the game following a hit on Burrow in the second quarter. The sophomore hit Burrow near the top of his back and into his helmet on the play, but he still finished with two tackles and a sack.\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\n\nAfter falling four spots to No. 7 in the College Football Playoff rankings following last week\u2019s loss to Alabama, the Tigers reasserted their position as one of the country\u2019s best \u2014 and kept alive their slim hopes of finishing among the top four teams at the end of the season.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nThe Tigers step out of conference to host Rice.\n\nArkansas travels to Mississippi State.\n\n___\n\nhttps://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "CEDAY CITY, Utah (AP) \u2014 Josh Davis ran for 225 yards and two touchdowns and Weber State kept pace in the Big Sky Conference race with a 31-18 victory over Southern Utah on Saturday night.\n\nWeber State (8-2, 6-1 Big Sky Conference) is now tied with UC Davis and Eastern Washington atop the conference standings.

The last Bulls player to score 20-plus points in 14 consecutive games was Jimmy Butler, who did it 15 straight times in 2016.\n\n\u201cI thought it was Zach\u2019s best game as far as making the simple play,\u201d coach Fred Hoiberg said. \u201cWe\u2019ve really been on him about making the right play and the right read, and tonight I thought he was really about that when they were blitzing him on the floor.\u201d\n\nBut Cleveland nearly pulled this one out after LaVine\u2019s lone turnover\n\nWith 13 seconds left, Carter couldn\u2019t handle LaVine\u2019s pass and Cleveland recovered. Coach Larry Drew called a timeout to set up a final play, but Cavs rookie guard Collin Sexton was blocked by Jabari Parker as he drove to the basket at the buzzer.\n\n\u201cI made a dumb mistake at the end,\u201d LaVine said. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have nonchalant passed it to Wendell. That was my bad, but we made a good stand.\u201d\n\nThe 23-year-old LaVine was flashy at times, scoring on several highlight-reel dunks. Arcidiacono, making his first career start, scored 10 of his points in the first half.\n\n\u201cI thought I was able to get into a rhythm when I got a few defensive possessions and got on the floor once,\u201d Arcidiacono said.\n\nTristan Thompson had 22 points and 12 rebounds for the league-worst Cavs. Sexton scored a season-high 20 points in his second straight start and second of his career.\n\nStill, the 19-year-old couldn\u2019t connect on the final shot as he played more than 34 minutes.\n\n\u201cI felt like I got to my spot and that was the right spot,\u201d Sexton said. \u201cThey told me to take that, I\u2019m going to make it the next time.\u201d\n\nDrew said Sexton executed the final play perfectly. Parker just stopped him.\n\n\u201cWe got the shot that we wanted,\u201d Drew said. \u201cIt was clear off of Collin, he got all the way to the basket and the ball didn\u2019t go in.\u201d\n\nRodney Hood also had 20 points and Jordan Clarkson came off the bench to score 15, but the Cavaliers lost their fifth straight. Cleveland\u2019s only win this season was on Oct. 30 over Atlanta.\n\nCavs forward Cedi Osman sat out the game with back spasms. He was forced to leave Wednesday\u2019s loss to Oklahoma City in the first quarter, becoming the latest Cavs player to join an injury list that includes All-Star forward Kevin Love, point guard George Hill and forward Sam Dekker.\n\nThe Bulls came out firing, shooting 64 percent from the floor through the first quarter and taking a 37-23 lead as LaVine scored 11 points and Arcidiacono had 10.\n\nThen Chicago opened its biggest lead, at 16 points, when Antonio Blakeney hit a running jumper 42 seconds into the second quarter.\n\nBut Cleveland roared back to tie it 53-all at halftime as it outscored Chicago 30-16 in the second quarter, including a 9-0 run.

He added three rebounds and five assists. Booth missed most of 2016-17 with knee issues and part of last season with a hand injury. He\u2019s now averaging 20 a game through two contests.\n\nVillanova (2-0) led by double digits from the 13:10 mark of the first half onward and led by as many as 37. The Wildcats out-rebounded Quinnipiac, 50-29, and grabbed 20 off the offensive glass, leading to 26 second chance points.\n\nDunleavy, who played at Villanova and was on the team\u2019s coaching staff from 2010 to 2017, told Villanova coach Jay Wright that he knew the \u201cbuzz-saw\u201d was coming after watching the tape from Villanova\u2019s season opening win against Morgan State.\n\n\u201cWe really wanted to come in here and build confidence by playing this game,\u201d Dunleavy said \u201cIt\u2019s hard to do that when you get jumped on early and that\u2019s what happened.\u201d\n\nQuinnipiac made one of its first 11 attempts from the floor, allowing Villanova to build an early 18-3 lead less than 10 minutes into the game. Villanova, which shot 7 of 15 from beyond the three-point arc in the first half, got a three pointer from freshman Saddiq Bey before the first half buzzer sounded to take a 47-20 lead into halftime.\n\nThe Wildcats, at that point, had more points on three pointers than the Bobcats had total points. Villanova forced nine first half turnovers.\n\n\u201cOur full-court pressure really did a good job,\u201d Wright said.\n\nJoining Booth in double figures for the Wildcats were sophomore guard Collin Gillespie, who shot 4 of 6 from deep and finished 16 points, and senior forward Eric Paschall, who scored 11 points on 4-of-6 shooting and added eight rebounds and three assists.\n\nCameron Young\u2019s 18 points paced Quinnipiac.\n\nHOMECOMING\n\nDunleavy played at Villanova in the early 2000s under Wright and later joined his coaching staff in 2010.

The Wizards opened the fourth on a 31-12 run, with Wall and Rivers fueling most of that effort.\n\n\u201cIt was probably one of our best games, how we played,\u201d Wizards coach Scott Brooks said. \u201cWe played a physical brand, we fought for one another and I thought we made timely passes and shots.\u201d\n\nJeff Green had 19 points and 10 rebounds for the Wizards. Rivers scored 18, as did Bradley Beal, and the Wizards won for only the third time in 12 games to start the season.\n\n\u201cYou work hard all summer, throughout the season, to prepare yourself for those type of moments,\u201d Wall said. \u201cAustin got into a great rhythm.\u201d\n\nWashington opened the fourth on a 31-12 run, before the Heat trimmed what was as much as a 17-point deficit down considerably in the final minutes but never seriously threatened again. Dwight Howard finished with 11 points and 16 rebounds for the Wizards, who outrebounded Miami 48-38 \u2014 the first time Washington won that stat battle all season.\n\nThe Wizards also got a boost at the foul line, shooting 28 for 38 there compared with 20 for 26 by Miami.\n\n\u201cWe had moments where we competed defensively, and we had other moments where I didn\u2019t recognize our team,\u201d Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said.\n\nJosh Richardson scored 24 points and Rodney McGruder had a career-high 22 for the Heat. Wayne Ellington added 16 points, Hassan Whiteside finished with 15 points and 14 rebounds and Tyler Johnson scored 12 points for Miami.\n\nThe Heat were again without Dwyane Wade, who sat a third consecutive game after the birth of his daughter. Goran Dragic returned after missing Miami\u2019s last two games with right knee inflammation, but he struggled and shot 0 for 7 in 21 minutes.\n\nMiami led 35-25 after one quarter and pushed its lead out to 12 early in the second, and couldn\u2019t finish. Washington was within three by halftime, two going into the fourth and took what was then its largest lead of the night \u2014 six points, 92-86 \u2014 when Wall connected on a foul-line jumper to cap a 9-1 spurt that opened the fourth.\n\nAnd that set the tone for the finish. A night after Washington trimmed a 25-point deficit down to one late but fell in Orlando, it finished the job in Miami.\n\n\u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be any team that\u2019s more desperate than us,\u201d Ellington said.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nWizards: Washington evened the season-series with Miami at 1-1, with both clubs winning on the road. ...

He played but was limited to 13 minutes, scoring five points. ... This was the 20th home back-to-back in Heat history, and only the third time they dropped both ends of such a set.\n\nBACK TO BACK\n\nSaturday completed the first back-to-back of the season for Washington \u2014 which still has 14 left to play. The Wizards are one of four teams playing 15 of the sets this season; no team has more. Miami has already finished three back-to-backs, ending two of them against Washington, and has only nine remaining.\n\nIN FRONT\n\nWith the victory, Brooks moved ahead of Spoelstra on the NBA career winning percentage list \u2014 by an extremely slim margin.

My groin is a little dinged up.\u201d\n\nHaving already locked up a spot in the Southeastern Conference championship game, the Bulldogs (9-1, 7-1, No. 5 CFP) couldn\u2019t afford to slip up against the Tigers. They finished with 303 yards rushing \u2014 the second straight week they\u2019ve eclipsed 300 yards on the ground.\n\n\u201cWe knew what was at stake,\u201d Swift said. \u201cWe were playing for a lot more than they were playing for, so we didn\u2019t want them to mess up our future.\u201d\n\nIt took Georgia a while to get going. Trailing 10-6 with the first half winding down, the Bulldogs faced third-and-4 from the Auburn 14 and the prospect of bringing on kicker Rodrigo Blankenship for a third field goal attempt. But Jake Fromm connected on a touchdown pass to Tyler Simmons that pushed the home team ahead with 2:47 remaining.\n\nAuburn (6-4, 3-4, No. 24 CFP) went three-and-out, giving Georgia a chance to add to its lead.\n\nSwift broke off a 24-yard run before two short completions left the Bulldogs with fourth-and-3 at the Tigers 38. After letting the clock run down to 29 seconds, Georgia went with no-back alignment and Fromm found Terry Godwin breaking free over the middle.\n\nGodwin hauled in the pass without breaking stride and didn\u2019t go down until he tumbled into the end zone for a TD that suddenly pushed Georgia to a 20-10 lead at the break.\n\nSwift tacked on the clinching score, darting through a hole up the middle, brushing off a would-be tackler and finding a clear running lane down the left sideline.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember what I did,\u201d Swift said with a smile. \u201cI\u2019ll probably see it on my phone. But when I\u2019m running, it just comes to me.\u201d\n\nAuburn\u2019s only touchdown came from a bit of trickery. Out of the wildcat formation, running back JaTarvious Whitlow took a direct snap and threw a 9-yard scoring pass to tight end John Shenker late in the first quarter.\n\nIn the end, it was another disappointment in a season that began with such high hopes.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m telling everybody to keep their head up,\u201d safety Daniel Thomas said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to keep playing for each other and stay together.\u201d\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nAuburn: The Tigers failed to build on their comeback victory over Texas A&M, doomed once again by a sluggish offense. Jarrett Stidham missed several open receivers and threw for just 163 yards. The running game showed improvement, finishing with 102 yards, but this performance is sure to keep the heat on offensive-minded coach Gus Malzahn.\n\nGeorgia: The offense still looks a bit out of sync, settling for a couple of field goals instead of touchdowns. They\u2019ll need to get that sorted out to have any chance against No. 1 Alabama in the SEC championship game. But Swift\u2019s emergence is big news for the Bulldogs, giving them a true dual threat in the backfield with Elijah Holyfield, who rushed for 93 yards.\n\nBIG KAT BANISHED\n\nSophomore defensive end Big Kat Bryant was ejected in the first half after lowering his helmet into a Fromm, a targeting penalty that was especially needless because the Georgia quarterback already was getting sacked when Bryant dove at him head first. The Auburn player also will have to sit out the first half of next week\u2019s game against Liberty.\n\nIT\u2019S A FAKE!\n\nIn a rather puzzling move, Georgia tried a fake field goal in the closing minutes with the outcome no longer in doubt.\n\nBlankenship lined up for a 26-yard attempt, but instead received a direct snap and lofted a pass down the middle for Isaac Nauta. The tight end was open, but Blankenship\u2019s pass sailed over him by a couple of yards.\n\nRECORD SETTER\n\nRyan Davis has now caught more passes than any player in Auburn history. His 13 receptions gave him 165 in his career, surpassing Courtney Taylor\u2019s mark of 153 from 2003-06.\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\n\nWith the top four schools winning easily Saturday and No. 6 Oklahoma barely surviving against Oklahoma State, Georgia should remain right where it is in The Associated Press rankings.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nBoth teams have a breather next Saturday before closing out the regular season against their state rivals.\n\nGeorgia hosts UMass (4-7), an independent FBS school that was blown out by Boston College in its only game against a Power Five school this season. Auburn returns home to take on FBS independent Liberty (4-5), which will be coming off a 45-24 loss to Virginia.\n\n___\n\nFollow Paul Newberry on Twitter at www.twitter.com/pnewberry1963 .

Online shoppers spent more than $14 billion within the first two hours of China's annual buying frenzy on Sunday, once again breaking records as the consumer tradition enters its 10th year. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)\n\nSHANGHAI (AP) \u2014 Online shoppers in China have shattered last year\u2019s record by making $30.8 billion in sales on the country\u2019s annual buying frenzy Sunday, as the tradition marked its 10th year.\n\nThe spending binge has for years eclipsed Cyber Monday in the U.S. for online purchases made on a single day.\n\nThis year\u2019s tally was 27 percent higher than a year ago. It breaks from gloomy forecasts about the world\u2019s second-largest economy, which is struggling with a tariff war with the U.S., a stock market slump and slowing overall growth.\n\nKnown as Singles Day, the clamor for deals and discounts was heralded with characteristic fanfare by Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, which has turned an unofficial holiday for people without romantic partners into a yearly windfall for digital retailers.\n\nA massive screen at Alibaba\u2019s gala in Shanghai showed the surging sales numbers in real time. Just before 4 p.m. Sunday, the sales reached 168.2 billion yuan ($24.2 billion) \u2014 surpassing the total purchases from last year\u2019s Singles Day, according to figures posted online by Alibaba Group.\n\nAt the end of the 24-hour spree, Alibaba reported sales totaled up to 213.5 billion yuan ($30.8 billion).\n\nAlibaba Group CEO Daniel Zhang said the results reflected \u201cthe strength and rise of China\u2019s consumption economy.\u201d\n\nSingles Day began as a spoof event celebrated by unattached Chinese university students in the 1990s. In Chinese, it\u2019s called \u201cDouble 11,\u201d after the numbers in the month and date. The improvised holiday was co-opted by e-retailers in 2009 and transformed into China\u2019s version of Cyber Monday, as the Monday after Thanksgiving is known.\n\nNearly $6.6 billion in sales were made on Cyber Monday in 2017, up about 17 percent from the previous year, according to Adobe Analytics.\n\nRen Xiaotong, a 27-year-old accountant in Beijing, said she suspected online stores jacked up their prices in the lead-up to Singles Day so they could declare that items were discounted.\n\nBut in the end, her skepticism didn\u2019t stop her from partaking.\n\n\u201cSingles Day is different now \u2014 it has more tricks than before,\u201d Ren said. \u201cYou only save a few dozens of yuan at the end. That being said, I still bought a pair of shoes, simply to celebrate the festival.\u201d\n\nThe Twitter-like Weibo platform was blanketed with Singles Day-related posts on Sunday, from users proudly proclaiming that they had resisted the shopping urge this year to those who cheerfully listed an array of mundane purchases.\n\nAlibaba founder Jack Ma, who will step down as chairman in less than a year, attended the start of the gala in Shanghai and appeared in a video message in which he wrapped up live hair crabs, a popular online purchase.\n\nSingles Day \u201cis not a day of discounts, but rather a day of gratitude,\u201d Ma said in the video. \u201cIt\u2019s when retailers use the best products and best prices to show their gratitude to our consumers.\u201d\n\nChinese e-commerce platforms have come under fire in the past for peddling low-quality and counterfeit items. Hong Tao, an economics professor at Beijing Technology and Business University, said Singles Day encourages shoppers to prioritize cheap prices over high quality, causing them to purchase items they don\u2019t need.\n\n\u201cPeople are swept up in the festivities,\u201d Hong said in a phone interview. \u201cThis burst of consumption, confined to just one day, can be exhausting for both buyers and sellers.\u201d\n\nThe occasion also has big environmental implications.\n\nWhile both Alibaba and competitor JD.com have pledged to use biodegradable packaging to cut down on waste, research conducted this month by Greenpeace East Asia said many plastics marked \u201cbiodegradable\u201d and used by Chinese e-retailers can break down only under high temperatures in facilities that are limited in number across the country.\n\nGreenpeace estimated that by 2020, \u201cbiodegradable\u201d packaging could produce roughly 721 truckloads of trash in China every day.\n\n___\n\nWang reported from Beijing.", "RUSTON, La.

Investigators continue to work to figure out why an ex-Marine opened fire Wednesday evening inside a Southern California country music bar, killing multiple people. (AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes)\n\nTHOUSAND OAKS, Calif. (AP) \u2014 An autopsy determined that the gunman who killed 12 people at a Southern California bar died from a self-inflicted gunshot, police said Saturday.\n\nIan David Long, a 28-year-old ex-Marine machine-gunner, fatally shot 11 people at the Borderline Bar and Grill in Thousand Oaks and a police officer who responded just before midnight Wednesday. The officer exchanged gunfire with Long, who was found dead at the scene.\n\nVentura County Sheriff Bill Ayub said an autopsy determined Long fatally shot himself.\n\nAuthorities have yet to determine a motive and are exploring all possibilities. Among them is whether Long believed a former girlfriend might have been at the bar, which was filled with about 150 people on its popular college night that attracts students from several nearby schools.\n\nSheriff\u2019s Capt. Garo Kuredjian said investigators were still interviewing witnesses, have served a search warrant at Long\u2019s home and searched the car Long drove to the bar.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to exhaust every investigative means possible,\u201d Kuredjian told the Ventura County Star.\n\nKuredjian said there is no timeline for completing the investigation.

At least a half-dozen people interviewed by The Associated Press who described themselves as regulars at the bar don\u2019t ever recall seeing Long there.\n\nAuthorities described an attack of military efficiency . When Long shot his .45-caliber pistol, he killed. All of the injured suffered cuts, bruises and other minor injuries in frantic attempts to escape the gunfire. Some smashed windows and jumped out.\n\nBased on time stamps, investigators say, Long posted to Instagram during the attack. The post involved his mental state and whether people would believe he was sane.\n\nHis social media accounts have been taken down but a law enforcement official said Long posted about his mental state and whether people would believe he was sane. The official, who was briefed on the investigation but not authorized to discuss it publicly, spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.\n\nLong grew up in Thousand Oaks and several people who knew him described him in disturbing terms. Long made others feel uncomfortable going back to his teens.\n\nDominique Colell, who coached girls\u2019 track and field at the high school where Long was a sprinter, remembers an angry young man who could be verbally and physically combative.\n\nIn one instance, Colell said Long used his fingers to mimic shooting her in the back of the head as she talked to another athlete.

(AP Photo/Butch Dill)\n\nHold up on handing Tua Tagovailoa the Heisman Trophy.\n\nThe Alabama quarterback looked only OK in the top-ranked Crimson Tide\u2019s shutout of No. 18 Mississippi State . And a chronically cranky knee again kept him from finishing the game. After tearing through the first two months of the season with what looked like one of the great offenses in college football history, Alabama now looks like the 1985 Chicago Bears.\n\nThis all still bodes well for the Crimson Tide\u2019s national championship hopes. Drop 50 or allow nothing. Alabama is capable of either. But Tagovailoa\u2019s pedestrian effort (14 for 21 for 164 yards with a touchdown and an interception) against a good Mississippi State defense could make Heisman voters take another look at other candidates \u2014 like No. 6 Oklahoma\u2019s Kyler Murray.\n\nMurray\u2019s numbers have stacked up well to Tagovailoa\u2019s throughout the season, but the Tale of Tua has been tough to top. The sophomore has been piling up touchdowns while not even needing to take a snap in the fourth quarter. Tagovailoa is up to 28 touchdown passes on the season, with just two picks. He will probably take next week off when Alabama takes its November FCS break against The Citadel. Then the Iron Bowl and SEC championship game against No. 5 Georgia will provide more than enough opportunity for Tagovailoa to wrap up the third Heisman of Nick Saban\u2019s tenure. The Tide never had a Heisman winner until Mark Ingram won it in 2009 and Derrick Henry took it in 2015.\n\nMurray, meanwhile, had another huge game, throwing for 349 yards and running for 66 in a wild Bedlam victory against Oklahoma State . West Virginia\u2019s Will Grier is still hanging around the Heisman race, too. He had three touchdown passes in a blowout of TCU . And there is Washington State\u2019s Gardner Minshew, who has the Cougars pointed toward a Pac-12 title after throwing for 335 yards and two TDs against Colorado . Having the most famous mustache in the college football should help get Minshew to New York as a finalist.\n\nMurray\u2019s escape against Oklahoma State means the Sooners and Mountaineers are still on target for a first-place showdown in Morgantown the day after Thanksgiving.\n\nOf course, the bigger concern for Alabama is not the Heisman but Tagovailoa\u2019s balky knee which seems to send him into the sideline injury tent every week.\n\n\u201cTua got hit low a few times out there today,\u201d Saban said after the game. \u201cI think he\u2019s OK.\u201d\n\nBUCKEYES D\n\nNo. 8 Ohio State seemed to get its defense back in order in what turned out to be a lopsided victory against No. 24 Michigan State . The Buckeyes allowed a season-low 54 yards rushing, 47 on one long quarterback keeper by Rocky Lombardi, and held the Spartans to 18 for 48 passing (37.5 percent).\n\nGive some credit to Ohio State. The Buckeyes have been a mess of missed tackles, poor angles and blown assignments, leading to big plays for opponents. Ohio State was more sound, but Michigan State\u2019s offense is also totally dysfunctional. The real MVP for the Buckeyes was punter Drue Chrisman, who buried Michigan State at its own 6 or worse on five straight punts.\n\nThe Buckeyes get Maryland next week in Columbus before No. 4 Michigan comes to town Thanksgiving weekend in a game that will likely decide the Big Ten East and eliminate the loser from playoff contention.\n\nAwaiting the Buckeyes or Wolverines in the Big Ten title game in Indianapolis will be Northwestern. Coach Pat Fitzgerald\u2019s Wildcats put a spell on another Big Ten opponent, this time Iowa , and pulled out another weirdly ugly victory. Call in FitzMagic.\n\nCombined with losses by Purdue and Wisconsin, the Wildcats (6-4) have their first Big Ten West title. The team that lost to Akron. The team that has outscored its opponents this season by six measly points.

Arizona State improved to 3-0 in games decided by three points with a 31-28 victory against UCLA . Herm Edwards\u2019 Sun Devils have games at Oregon and against Arizona left. Win them both and they are in the Pac-12 title game. ... Pitt\u2019s Darrin Hall has run for 415 yards the last two weeks after getting 186 on seven carries in a victory against Virginia Tech , putting the Panthers in position to clinch the ACC Coastal by beating Wake Forest next week. ... Remember when Virginia Tech was in the Top 25? The Hokies now need to win out to extend their 26-year streak of bowl appearances. ... Houston defensive tackle Ed Oliver missed a third straight game with a sore knee and you have to wonder if the likely high first-round NFL draft pick will play again this season. Houston has now lost three games. The Cougars could still reach the AAC title game, but with a major bowl highly unlikely the risk of returning might not be worth the reward.\n\n___\n\nFollow Ralph D.

Tre Walker added a career-high 209 yards and two touchdowns on seven catches for the Spartans (1-9, 1-5 MW), who lost their second straight game.\n\nUtah State shook off a slow start and quickly buried San Jose State before halftime.

San Jose State gave up multiple big plays to allow the Aggies to pull away. There\u2019s plenty of work for coach Brent Brennan to do on both sides of the ball to make the Spartans competitive.\n\nUtah State: Few defenses are equipped to handle Utah State\u2019s speed and efficiency. Utah State had eight scoring drives that lasted less than three minutes and three that took less than a minute off the clock.\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\n\nUtah State should continue to climb in the AP Top 25 after a record-setting performance and could finally crack the Top 25 in the CFP Poll on Tuesday.

Jim Justice said that he has accepted the resignation of the suspended state Supreme Court justice recently convicted of federal charges, days ahead of a legislative session set to consider the justice\u2019s removal amid an ongoing scandal involving the court. (Craig Hudson/The Charleston Gazette-Mail via AP)\n\nCHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) \u2014 A suspended West Virginia Supreme Court justice who was recently convicted of 11 federal charges is stepping down just ahead of a special legislative session to consider his removal, the governor\u2019s office disclosed Saturday.\n\nIt was the latest development in an impeachment scandal miring some past and present justices in varying accusations including abuse of authority and failure to rein in excessive spending that has engulfed the state\u2019s highest court for months.\n\nRepublican Gov. Jim Justice\u2019s office said late Saturday that he received a letter from Justice Allen Loughry and accepted his resignation effective at the close of business Monday, a day ahead of Tuesday\u2019s scheduled special session. Justice had no further comment in his brieft statement, and Loughry\u2019s one-sentence resignation letter didn\u2019t elaborate.\n\nLoughry was convicted last month of federal criminal charges including wire fraud involving his personal use of state cars and fuel cards and mail fraud. He has requested a new trial.\n\nLoughry couldn\u2019t be reached for comment and phone and email messages seeking comment from his attorney, John A. Carr, were not immediately returned.\n\nJustice recently called a special legislative session for Tuesday, saying in his proclamation that it would consider removing Loughry from his post.\n\nLoughry and three other justices were impeached by the West Virginia House in August over questions involving lavish office renovations that evolved into varying accusations of corruption, incompetence and neglect of duty. One of them, Justice Beth Walker, was cleared of an impeachment charge at a Senate trial last month.\n\nThe West Virginia Supreme Court last month effectively halted the Legislature\u2019s remaining efforts to impeach the state\u2019s justices as a violation of the separate of power doctrine. The court ruled that the Senate lacks jurisdiction to pursue its impeachment trial of Justice Margaret Workman.\n\nThe Senate had postponed Workman\u2019s trial after the presiding judge didn\u2019t show up following the court ruling. A panel of acting justices said the court\u2019s decision to stop Workman\u2019s impeachment hearing also applies to retired Justice Robin Davis and Loughry, who had petitioned the court to intervene.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t immediately clear whether Loughry\u2019s imminent departure would alter Tuesday\u2019s special session plans.\n\nMeanwhile, Senate President Mitch Carmichael, a Republican, lauded the resignation announcement Saturday.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate that Justice Loughry has decided to do the right thing and step down from the Court,\u201d Carmichael said in a statement. He added that with the resignation and recent voter approval of a judicial budget oversight amendment, \u201cI believe we are well on our way to rebuilding the trust of our citizens in the judicial branch.\u201d\n\nJudicial elections in West Virginia became nonpartisan in 2016, but the court\u2019s impeachment scandal this year stirred political attacks. Some Democrats argued that the court\u2019s shakeup over spending and other issues was a power grab by the Republican-led legislature.\n\nOn Election Day, two state Supreme Court justices appointed to the court after the scandal broke won election to continue on the bench: Former House speaker Tim Armstead and ex-Congressman Evan Jenkins won those races Tuesday night, each defeating nine other candidates. They had originally been appointed by Justice to fill two of the seats on the state\u2019s highest court pending the midterm election.\n\nArmstead will complete the term of Justice Menis Ketchum, who announced his resignation on the eve of the House\u2019s impeachment proceedings. The term runs through 2020.\n\nJenkins will serve until 2024, when the term of retired Justice Robin Davis ends. Davis also was impeached.\n\nThe ballot measure approved by voters allows the Legislature to decide each year whether to reduce the courts\u2019 budget but not less than 85 percent of the previous year\u2019s budget. It also would require the Supreme Court\u2019s chief justice to answer budget questions before lawmakers. Opponents have said limiting the Supreme Court\u2019s budgetary control would infringe on its independence.\n\nThe chief justice currently has constitutional autonomy in deciding how the system spends a $139 million annual budget.", "", "", "", "NORFOLK, Va.

Brewer then quick snapped and sneaked into the end zone, which would have made it 14-6. But officials waved Brewer\u2019s TD off, reviewed the Jones reception and waved that off after it showed the ball clearly hit the ground. Connor Martin then badly shanked a 29-yard field goal.\n\nALMOST BREWING\n\nWith 8:05 left, Chris Platt beat Iowa State\u2019s defense on a vertical route and was open near the end zone. Brewer hit a diving Platt on the hands, but the ball instead went through them. That drive ended on downs at Iowa State\u2019s 12 with 4:49 left.\n\nMONTGOMERY\u2019S REACTION\n\nMontgomery used his Twitter account to apologize for his ejection, saying in part that he \u201cshould have not reacted the way I did and I sincerely apologize for that!!!

A handful of U.S. and European financial firms have been granted the status of domestic investors since 2002 but the main class of \u201cA\u2033 shares is off-limits to most foreign investors.\n\nThe latest price slide began in January after Beijing clamped down on bank lending to rein in surging debt.\n\nShares in real estate and other companies that thrive on credit were hit hard. Aluminum Corp. of China, a major building materials supplier, tumbled 52 percent. China Vanke Co., a developer, is off 40 percent.\n\nThe economic downturn brought on by credit controls was more abrupt than Chinese leaders wanted, prompting them to reverse course and tell banks to lend more. They promised tax cuts and other help after economic growth slumped to a post-global crisis low of 6.5 percent over a year earlier in the three months ending in September.\n\nBut the impact of those measures has yet to show up in economic data.\n\n\u201cMarket sentiment has remained very weak,\u201d UBS economists said in a report.\n\nThe slump drove university student Shao Xinyu to the sidelines less than a year after he started buying stocks.\n\nShao, from the central city of Zhengzhou, invested 30,000 yuan ($5,000) from his savings and gifts from his parents. The market plunge slashed the value of that stake by one-third.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t invest more,\u201d said Shao, 21. \u201cI need to wait to see how the economy and the market develop.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s stock markets have ridden a boom-and-bust roller coaster since 1990, when the first exchange since the 1949 communist revolution opened in Shanghai. A second exchange followed the next year in Shenzhen, near Hong Kong.\n\nPrices soared and slumped in 2001, 2008 and again in 2015.\n\nDespite that, small investors piled into stocks.\n\nThe number of individual Chinese trading accounts nearly quintupled between 2006 and 2017, hitting 192 million, according to the Shanghai Stock Exchange\u2019s annual report.\n\nBrokerages opened trading rooms where small investors with jars of tea and bundles of financial newspapers perched on plastic seats in front of wall-mounted price monitors. Today, most of those have closed as trading shifted online.\n\nThree-quarters of Chinese trading accounts are worth less than 500,000 yuan ($71,000), according to the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, and most traders have a few thousand dollars invested, buying shares directly instead of using mutual funds.\n\nLu, the retired salesman, said he started out 15 years ago with 10,000 yuan ($1,500) and turned that into 100,000 yuan ($15,000) before selling most of his shares.\n\nIndividual investors owned about 21 percent of the market as of the end of 2017, or shares worth 5.9 trillion yuan ($842 billion), according to the Shanghai exchange. Galaxy Securities, a brokerage, says about 30 percent of that, or 1.9 trillion yuan ($271 billion), was in mutual funds.\n\nInvestors already were skittish after the 2015 price collapse. Then, Beijing plowed billions of dollars into stopping the slide and suspended plans for stock offerings by state-owned companies.\n\nConfidence took another hit after a wave of arrests of brokerage executives, a star Chinese trader and a former market regulator on charges of insider trading and manipulating prices.\n\nLi Jun, a retired hotel chief executive in the eastern city of Nanjing, said his nest egg of 300,000-400,000 yuan ($40,000-$60,000) in stocks was cut in half by the market routs in 2008 and 2015.\n\n\u201cI avoid putting in more money, because what is the use of doing that?\u201d said Li, 81.\n\nRegulators have tried in vain to encourage investors to shift from rapid-fire trading to holding for the long term. The Shanghai exchange said individual investors accounted for 82 percent of its daily trading volume in 2017, little changed from previous years.\n\nInstead, regulators are gradually allowing in more foreign buyers in hopes they will provide ballast as long-term investors.\n\nSince 2014, foreigners have been able to buy some \u201cA\u2033 shares through Hong Kong. In July, regulators announced foreigners working in China would be given access to the whole market.Now, investors worry about a possible new downward spiral if prices of shares pledged as collateral by companies for loans fall far enough that banks and brokerages might seize and sell them to recover their money.\n\nThe government tried to allay those fears by announcing on Oct. 19 that Chinese insurers would be allowed to create units to buy such shares temporarily to keep them from flooding the market.\n\nThe same day, officials led by Vice Premier Liu He, Xi\u2019s top economic adviser, launched a media campaign to talk prices back up. The central bank governor, Yi Gang, was quoted as saying \u201ceconomic fundamentals are good.\u201d Liu said cheaper stocks created \u201cgood investment opportunities.\u201d\n\n\u201cI welcome the government\u2019s efforts to support the markets,\u201d said Li, the retired hotel executive. \u201cBut as for whether that is effective, I really don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nThe Shanghai index gained 4 percent after the ruling party leadership promised Oct. 31 to \u201cintensify reform.\u201d That prompted expectations of further easing in lending controls.\n\nXi followed with a Nov. 1 speech that promised tax cuts and other help to entrepreneurs that generate new jobs and wealth. Private sector analysts saw that as an affirmation of the importance of private business amid complaints state industry is a drag on the economy.\n\nThe latest measures helped to reassure Liu Fei, a manager at a Shanghai real estate company. She stuck with the market after losing 40 percent of her money in the 2015 crash but said her faith was waning.\n\n\u201cA week ago, I panicked and felt the Chinese stock market was finished,\u201d said Liu, 28. \u201cBut I gained confidence after the government issued supporting policies.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press researcher Yu Bing contributed to this report.", "1 of 11 Tennessee wide receiver Marquez Callaway (1) catches a Hail Mary pass for a touchdown while being defended by Kentucky cornerback Derrick Baity Jr. (8) as time expires in the first half of an NCAA college football game Saturday, Nov. 10, 2018, in Knoxville, Tenn.

(AP Photo/Luca Bruno)\n\nMILAN (AP) \u2014 Towels have unexpectedly become a hotly-debated subject in tennis this week.\n\nA number of new initiatives are being trialed at the second edition of ATP\u2019s Next Gen Finals in Milan over the past week, one of which is the towel-rack, with players having to fetch their own towels from boxes stationed in the corners of the court.\n\nThis is a welcome sight for many who have been made uneasy by the way some tennis stars interact with ball kids when being handed the towel.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at all the elements of tennis and the show around tennis,\u201d ATP President Chris Kermode said in an interview with The Associated Press on Saturday. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at shot clocks, the reduced warmups and that\u2019s just part of it.\n\n\u201cThere was quite a lot of public opinion that just didn\u2019t like the optics of ball kids and that sort of relationship with the player, of almost being ordered to do something. And so we took that into account and we think it was something we should look at.\u201d\n\nNot all the players are in favor of the rack, with top seed Stefanos Tsitsipas, who beat Australian teenager Alex de Minaur in Saturday\u2019s final, being a particularly vocal critic.\n\n\u201cOne thing that I didn\u2019t like that much was the towel thing,\u201d the world No. 15 said earlier in the week. \u201cI was always, you know, had to run for the towel, always had it in my mind when I was playing.\n\n\u201cI think having the towels whenever you need it, it\u2019s very helpful. It\u2019s one thing less that you have to think about. So I believe to be playing your best game you just don\u2019t need to think about whether you\u2019re going to take your towel now or later. You can just call the ball kid. I think the ball kid, it\u2019s their job to provide towels and balls for the players.\u201d\n\nAlexander Zverev wasn\u2019t in Milan as he is instead preparing for the ATP Finals in London, but he had a dig at Tsitsipas and others who he thinks use the towel too much.\n\n\u201cI heard Tsitsipas say it\u2019s the ball boys\u2019 job but it\u2019s the ball boys\u2019 job to give you balls \u2014 that\u2019s what I see the ball boys as,\u201d Zverev said.\n\n\u201cI think you should also prevent players from taking the towel after every single serve and every mishit return, sometimes it does get a little bit ridiculous in my eyes. So maybe it will prevent it from that.\u201d\n\nThe towel rack is just one of the new rules being applied, along with on-court coaching, shorter sets, no-Ad scoring, medical timeout limits, and no lets on serve.\n\nFor the players, the most popular innovations are the shot clock, and Hawk-Eye making all the line calls.\n\nThe on-court clocks enforce the 25-second rule between points, and shorter warm-ups ensure matches begin four minutes after the players enter the court.\n\n\u201cShot clocks for sure are going to soon be on (the tour), I can see that happening very quickly. Reduced warm ups, I think the electronic line calling ... all of those things can happen quite easily I think,\u201d Kermode said. \u201cIn the next couple of years I can see those coming onto the tour.\u201d\n\nThe most drastic change is the shorter set, where the first to four games takes the set, with a tiebreak at 3-3.\n\nAnd Kermode admitted that changing the scoring system would need a lot more consideration and analysis.\n\n\u201cThe attractive thing of tennis is that you have different styles of play, you have different court surfaces ... and how tennis currently stands is that everyone has a shot at winning,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have the big servers and you have the baseliners who play a bit more chess-like \u2014 and we want to make sure that both elements of styles can compete.\u201d\n\nThe idea for the tournament was first discussed three years ago with a two-fold reasoning behind it: to highlight the next generation of players and to bring in a new generation of fans.\n\nHowever, Kermode insists they will not be rushing into anything.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking 10 years ahead for the sport and I\u2019ve said right from the beginning we\u2019re not going to rush into doing any dramatic changes but, whilst tennis is doing so well, from a position of strength, we want to take our time now to look to the future.\n\n\u201cThe assurance that I want to give everybody is we will only be doing things if we think it is better. And that\u2019s why this is a test.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP tennis: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-Tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "Mississippi State quarterback Nick Fitzgerald (7) is pressured by Alabama defensive lineman Johnny Dwight (95) during the first half of an NCAA college football game, Saturday, Nov. 10, 2018, in Tuscaloosa, Ala.

(AP) \u2014 The 10th-ranked Washington State Cougars weren\u2019t in any hurry to bury the Buffaloes.\n\nGardner Minshew II had all day to pick his targets and he overcame a slow start and three fourth-down failures to lead the Cougars past Colorado 31-7 on Saturday.\n\nThe Cougars (9-1, 6-1 Pac-12, No. 8 CFP) won their sixth straight, but it wasn\u2019t as easy as expected against the Buffaloes (5-5, 2-5), who lost their fifth straight despite the return of star receiver Laviska Shenault Jr.\n\nWashington State led by three at the half and seven heading into the fourth quarter.\n\nThey did dominate the clock, however, winning the time of possession by nearly 24 minutes and holding the Buffaloes to an average drive of just 1:38.\n\n\u201cWe hogged the ball the whole game,\u201d Cougars coach Mike Leach said. \u201cBut I thought we could have capitalized on more stuff.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur defense was getting them off the field really fast, so hats off to them for getting us the ball,\u201d Minshew said.\n\nWashington State led just 10-7 at the break but linebacker Jahad Woods forced and recovered Travon McMillian\u2019s fumble at the Colorado 32 on the second play of the second half and Minshew threw a 1-yard dart to Renard Bell, sparking a 21-0 run that finally buried the Buffs.\n\nMinshew, who was hardly pressured all afternoon as Colorado failed to register a single sack for the first time all season, finished 35-of-58 passing for 335 yards and two TDs.\n\n\u201cI was off a little bit but I feel like we figured it out in the second half,\u201d said Minshew, who made it 24-7 on a 10-yard scramble in the fourth quarter on a drive was kept alive when Buffs safety Aaron Maddox was flagged for taunting Easop Winston on a key third down stop.\n\nInstead of fourth-and-9, it was first-and-10.\n\n\u201cThat was all on me,\u201d Maddox said. \u201cI promise you that won\u2019t happen again.\u201d\n\nIn the first half, Minshew didn\u2019t look anything like the nation\u2019s leading passer that he is.\n\nAfter having to burn a timeout before the first snap of the game and another one before the first quarter ended with Washington State still scoreless, the Cougars finally got on the board with a 39-yard field goal.\n\nThey caught a huge break when linebacker Nate Landman, the Buffs\u2019 leading tackler, was ejected for targeting after stuffing Minshew for no gain on a second-and-1 keeper in the second quarter. Minshew ran around his left tackle and was ducking when Landman hit him.\n\n\u201cIt was a good hit,\u201d Minshew said. \u201cBut it was a penalty. We\u2019re trying to keep players safe and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing is throwing a flag when that happens.\u201d\n\n\u201cLosing Nate\u2019s a tough blow,\u201d Colorado coach Mike MacIntyre said. \u201cSome of the mistakes we had underneath, he would have made\u201d those plays.\n\nWithout Landman, who was also ejected Oct. 6 against Arizona State, the Buffs couldn\u2019t stop the Cougars from taking a 10-7 halftime lead on running back Max Borghi\u2019s 28-yard catch and run .\n\nDespite their defense holding an opponent scoreless in the first quarter for the fifth straight game , the Buffs didn\u2019t capitalize as much as they could have. They only crossed midfield once in their seven first-half possessions, and that came on McMillian\u2019s 64-yard scamper to the 3. He ran it in on the next play for a 7-0 lead.\n\nColorado QB Steven Montez threw for just 67 yards in the first half and finished 20 of 35 for 199 yards and no touchdowns.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge win, any win on the road in our conference is hard,\u201d Leach said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard going down the path of real quality opponents. In this conference we don\u2019t really have any below average opponents they are all above average opponents. This is a huge win for us.\u201d\n\nSHAKING THE RUST\n\nShenault, who had 11 touchdowns during the Buffs\u2019 5-0 start, was rusty in his return from a right turf toe injury. He caught 10 passes for 102 yards but cost his team dearly with back-to-back drops and a lost fumble.\n\n\u201cI was pretty close\u201d to 100 percent, Shenault said. \u201cI\u2019m feeling fine.\u201d\n\nThe Cougars didn\u2019t act at all concerned about Laviska\u2019s return.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s that? No. 2?\u201d Washington State defensive lineman Logan Tago said. \u201cSorry.\u201d\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY:\n\nWashington State: The Cougars took their time burying the Buffaloes, but in the end, it was a solid rout thanks to their great defense and stout offensive line that kept Minshew\u2019s jersey laundry-fresh.\n\nColorado: Not even the return of Shenault could kick-start the Buffs, who were still missing wide receivers Jay MacIntyre (concussion) and K.D. Nixon (hip). \u201cThey both would have made a big difference for us today,\u201d Mike MacIntyre said. \u201cThere were some balls not caught over the middle that should have been.\u201d\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\n\nThe Cougars should stay in the top 10 with the Pac-12 title in their sights, and they\u2019re still the conference\u2019s last hope for a College Football Playoff berth.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nWashington State: Hosts Arizona on Saturday.\n\nColorado: Hosts Utah on Saturday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\n___\n\nFollow Arnie Melendrez Stapleton on Twitter: http://twitter.com/arniestapleton", "CHARLESTON, S.C.
