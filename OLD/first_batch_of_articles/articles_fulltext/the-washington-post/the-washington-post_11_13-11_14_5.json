Aides said Ricardel clashed with the first lady\u2019s staff over her visit to Africa last month.

Ricardel was the third person to hold the post under Trump.\n\nAn ally of national security adviser John Bolton, Ricardel began her service in the Trump administration as associate director in the White House Office of Presidential Personnel, then moved to the Commerce Department last year.\n\nBolton brought her into the West Wing shortly after taking the job in April.

(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nA transoceanic personnel crisis that engulfed the National Security Council this week is partly rooted in a bureaucratic dispute over the seating arrangements aboard first lady Melania Trump\u2019s plane to Africa last month during her maiden solo trip abroad.\n\nAs the East Wing prepared the flight manifest for the marquee trip, deputy national security adviser Mira Ricardel became angry that seats on the first lady\u2019s government jet were assigned to a larger-than-usual security entourage and a small press corps with none for Ricardel or another NSC staffer, according to current U.S. officials and others familiar with the trip and its aftermath.\n\nPolicy experts from the NSC and State Department were advised to fly separately and to meet the first lady\u2019s party on the ground, a practice the State Department had often used, but Ricardel objected strenuously, those people said. She threatened to revoke NSC resources associated with the trip, meaning no policy staff would advise the first lady during her visits to Ghana, Kenya, Malawi and Egypt.\n\nBad blood between Ricardel and Melania Trump and her staff continued for weeks after the trip, with the first lady privately arguing that the NSC\u2019s No. 2 official was a corrosive influence in the White House and should be dismissed. But national security adviser John Bolton rebuffed the first lady and protected his deputy, prompting the first lady\u2019s spokeswoman, Stephanie Grisham, to issue an extraordinary statement to reporters Tuesday effectively calling for Ricardel\u2019s firing.\n\n\u201cIt is the position of the Office of the First Lady that she no longer deserves the honor of serving in this White House,\u201d Grisham said of Ricardel in the statement.\n\nAfter an uncomfortable day of limbo, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders announced Wednesday evening that Ricardel was leaving the White House.\n\n\u201cMira Ricardel will continue to support the President as she departs the White House to transition to a new role within the Administration,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\nAn NSC spokesman declined to elaborate.\n\nThe first lady\u2019s decision to publicly advocate for the ouster of a senior member of her husband\u2019s staff shows a new willingness on her part to weigh in on White House operations and marks a change from earlier in the Trump administration, when she repeatedly played down her role as an adviser to the president.\n\nIt also comes as the president is mulling personnel changes, including possibly ousting Chief of Staff John F. Kelly and firing Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.\n\nAnita McBride, who was chief of staff to first lady Laura Bush, says Melania Trump\u2019s move was a dramatic show of power.\n\n\u201cIf anyone had questions about her willingness to exert her influence, they got their answer,\u201d she said.\n\nRicardel\u2019s dismissal also serves as a rebuke of Bolton, known for his sharp elbows and ability to navigate internal tensions, who refused for weeks to fire his handpicked deputy and worked in the past day to protect her.\n\nSoon after the first lady\u2019s office issued its statement Tuesday, surprised senior White House aides walked to Ricardel\u2019s office to see whether she was still there. She was, albeit confused.\n\nBolton, who was awakened in Asia in the middle of the night and told of the dust-up, was soon on the phone, telling Ricardel to remain at her post, three administration officials said.\n\nThe White House was trying to find a soft landing place for Ricardel, but agencies including the Commerce Department, where she worked in the first year of the Trump administration, are hesitant to take her on because of her reputation, two senior administration officials said.\n\nThe first lady\u2019s statement came after months of tension in the White House over Ricardel\u2019s abrasive interactions with staffers in both the East Wing and the West Wing, according to several current and former staffers.\n\nMelania Trump and Ricardel have never met, according to people familiar with each of them. But the first lady viewed the conservative operative, who was among the most senior women in the West Wing, as a toxic influence in the White House, to the point that she spoke to Trump about Ricardel after the Africa trip and authorized others to spread the word that Ricardel had overstepped the mark, several people familiar with recent events said.\n\nA senior White House official said the first lady believed Ricardel was spreading false rumors about her office, including a misleading story that aides had arranged a $10,000 hotel stay in Egypt. Other White House aides said Ricardel belittled underlings, shouted at professional staff and was the most disliked aide in the West Wing.\n\nLast weekend, according to administration officials, the first lady\u2019s office again asked Bolton to oust Ricardel. Others, including Kelly, have wanted her gone for months, administration officials said, with little success in overcoming Bolton\u2019s objections.\n\nBolton declined again \u2014 and went to Asia.\n\nWhile the first lady\u2019s public statement came as a surprise to many, including in the White House, Paolo Zampolli, a longtime friend of the Trumps\u2019, said the move isn\u2019t out of character for the first lady. \u201cOur first lady is very strong, and she has the right to choose who she\u2019s working with,\u201d he said.\n\nIn past administrations, first ladies exerted similar or greater influence, but always behind the scenes. The most famous modern example is Nancy Reagan\u2019s engineering the ouster of chief of staff Donald T. Regan, who had made the dire mistake of hanging up on her. While Nancy Reagan\u2019s fingerprints were all over the firing, there were no statements from her office to that effect.\n\n\u201cYou never hang up on the first lady. She can be your strongest ally. She can help you more than anybody realizes,\u201d said Kenneth Duberstein, who fared better as chief of staff to Reagan.\n\nMartha Washington, historian Carl Sferrazza Anthony noted, once wrote that she felt like a \u201cstate prisoner\u201d because of protocol rules and a schedule set in part by her husband\u2019s chief adviser, Tobias Lear. And there was no love lost between Mary Lincoln and Abraham Lincoln\u2019s chief counselors, John Hay and John Nicolay, who referred to her as \u201cthe hellcat\u201d behind her back.\n\nPat Nixon, Anthony says, chafed at top White House aides H.R. \u201cBob\u201d Haldeman and John Erlichman for perceived offenses that included not giving her enough notice before travel and for not taking her ambitious agenda seriously, Anthony said.\n\n\u201cIt goes back so far that what we\u2019re really talking about is human nature and the problem of the boss\u2019s wife,\u201d he said.\n\nMelania Trump has taken on a more public role recently, launching her anti-bullying campaign earlier this year and traveling to Africa in October.\n\nShe has made symbolic gestures that suggest she feels free to make her views plain and to disagree with her husband.\n\nIn a rare sit-down interview with ABC News last month, the first lady was asked whether it was true that she had more control over her notoriously volatile husband than anyone else. \u201cOh, I wish,\u201d she said. \u201cI give him my honest advice and honest opinions. And then he does what he wants to do.\u201d\n\nThe first lady has privately complained about other current and former White House officials to her husband \u2014 Stephen K. Bannon, chief among them \u2014 but has never before issued such a public statement.\n\nThe East Wing often does not clear its statements with the White House. Senior White House aides, including Kelly and Bolton, were not aware that the statement was coming before it was issued Tuesday. Press secretary Sarah Sanders had not seen the final statement, a senior administration official said.\n\nEven Kelly, who wanted Ricardel gone, told others he thought that the situation was handled poorly and that the White House looked bad.\n\nThe controversy has added to the turmoil surrounding the White House after last week\u2019s midterm elections, in which Republicans lost control of the House and maintained a slim Senate majority. Last week, Trump fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions before heading to Paris over the weekend for the commemoration of the end of World War I, a period during which he struck out at French President Emmanuel Macron via Twitter and Macron indirectly criticized Trump\u2019s embrace of \u201cnationalism.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis shows it\u2019s still a broken and dysfunctional White House. Maybe John Kelly has made a few trains run on time, but it\u2019s clearly still broken,\u201d said Chris Whipple, author of a 2017 book, \u201cThe Gatekeepers,\u201d about White House chiefs of staff and West Wing operations.\n\nPhilip Rucker contributed to this report.", "\n\nComedian Natasha Leggero used to joke that having a baby was like getting \"a DUI from the universe.\" (Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images for Sundance)\n\nThere was a time not long ago when comedian Natasha Leggero saw motherhood as an avoidable mistake. \u201cI had a joke that having a baby is like having a DUI from the universe,\u201d Leggero recalls. \u201cThat is really what I thought.\u201d Cut to February, when Leggero, 44, welcomed her first child, a baby girl, with husband and fellow comedian Moshe Kasher. Prior to motherhood, Leggero tackled subjects such as classism and gender politics through a comic persona of faux refinement; she made a name for herself as the co-creator and star of the Comedy Central sitcom \u201cAnother Period,\u201d a panelist on the network\u2019s popular \u201cRoast\u201d series, and a regular on the late-night TV circuit. What does Leggero\u2019s comedy look like now, as she enters a new phase of life? \u201cAt this point, I feel like I\u2019m just overdressed and over it,\u201d she jokes. \u201cAnd I am definitely inspired by having the kid, so I have a lot to say about that.\u201d Leggero will muse about motherhood (and more) when she visits Arlington for a series of stand-up shows this weekend.\n\nArlington Cinema and Drafthouse, 2903 Columbia Pike; Fri., 7:30 & 10 p.m., Sat., 7 & 9:30 p.m., $25.\n\nCongratulations on being a new mother. How is parenthood treating you?\n\nEveryone says how fast it goes, but it does seem like it\u2019s going very slowly. Definitely it\u2019s fun, and we\u2019re glad we did it, but what I didn\u2019t anticipate was how now 70 percent of my mental energy goes toward worrying about her, which is pretty taxing.\n\nYou joked extensively about your then-impending motherhood in \u201cThe Honeymoon Stand Up Special,\u201d which you filmed with your husband and released in April on Netflix. How have your expectations lined up with reality?\n\nNothing really can prepare you. One thing I wasn\u2019t quite clear on is that as a woman, it really does take a lot to have the baby. I had to pump myself full of fertility drugs, then I had to carry the baby, then I had to give birth to the baby, then I had to have the baby suck on my t--s for six months, and now I\u2019ve got this body from having a baby that I\u2019ve got to get rid of. It takes a man a whole three days to recover.\n\nYour stand-up often tackles sensitive subjects. In that Netflix special, for example, you spoke to audience members about their experiences dealing with sexual misconduct. How do you go about approaching that kind of material?\n\nI think that you just have to be sensitive, and I feel like I\u2019m lucky right now because I\u2019m a woman and a lot of the stuff I want to talk about is anti-men. That is actually accepted right now, so that\u2019s kind of cool. That is encouraged, almost. But a man who wants to be anti-woman, I think he\u2019s going to have a hard time out there.\n\nHaving been a stand-up for a decade-plus, how do you feel your comedic voice has evolved over the years?\n\nFor a long time, my main point of view was that I hated children and I would never have one. Then I decided when I met Moshe that I would have one baby with him \u2014 I made him promise we would only have one \u2014 and then you have that, and that changes you, and you just have to evolve and grow.\n\nHow does that growth come through in your comedy?\n\nSometimes I\u2019ll be doing stand-up and I\u2019ll have seven minutes of jokes about being a new mom, and I realize the crowd is too young and no one has a kid. So I\u2019m just sort of feeling it out. Please, if you have kids, come see me. And now I\u2019m sure I\u2019m scaring the young people!", "In this photograph taken Aug. 27, 2018, a Rohingya man looks at medicines being sold on the roadside in Balukhali refugee camp, Bangladesh.

(REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst)\n\nThe Trump administration on Wednesday spoke out forcefully against efforts by China and Myanmar to punish news reporters and political dissidents.\n\nBut at the White House, President Trump was focused on another case \u2014 his efforts to discredit CNN correspondent Jim Acosta.\n\nAcosta and others like him are \u201cbad for the country,\u201d Trump told a conservative news outlet. In a fundraising email, his campaign highlighted Trump\u2019s move last week to strip Acosta\u2019s White House pass and declared that the president \u201cwill NOT put up with the media\u2019s liberal bias and utter disrespect.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s latest assault on the press corps comes amid his mounting domestic political problems as Democrats prepare to take over the House in January. Yet in his bid to assert greater control over the media at home, Trump threatens to undermine his administration\u2019s efforts to curtail human rights abuses abroad.\n\nIn Singapore on Wednesday, Vice President Pence told Myanmar\u2019s de facto leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, to release two Reuters journalists jailed for covering brutal ethnic violence against the minority Rohingya Muslims. At the State Department, spokeswoman Heather Nauert called on Chinese leaders to respect \u201cfundamental freedoms\u201d amid a crackdown on political activism in Hong Kong.\n\nForeign-policy analysts say Trump\u2019s persistent attacks on news outlets, combined with his embrace of authoritarian leaders such as Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin and North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un, have emboldened repressive governments to ignore U.S. pressure.\n\n\u201cObviously, we want to see more efforts by the U.S. to stand up for our values, but it\u2019s hard to see the impact on a significant scale when we\u2019re seen as hypocritical or when what we say is not supported by the actions of our president,\u201d said Jeffrey Prescott, who served as a foreign policy aide in the Obama White House.\n\nIn 2013, Prescott accompanied Vice President Biden on a trip to Beijing during a period when China was denying visas to U.S. journalists over critical coverage of party leaders\u2019 personal finances. Biden met with a group of reporters and raised their cases directly with President Xi Jinping.\n\nPrescott pointed to surveys showing sharp drops in global confidence in U.S. leadership under Trump and said the president has unwisely discarded a tool of American influence.\n\n\u201cThe disconnect between the rhetoric coming out of the White House and what other officials are saying around the world does make the statements land with less force,\u201d Prescott said.\n\nPence is attending three Asia summits this week that Trump elected to skip, leaving a vacuum for Xi to promote China\u2019s trade and security agenda. Beijing has made clear that it has no intention of lecturing other countries on human rights, and the Chinese government has undertaken a massive roundup of Uighur Muslims, with an estimated 1 million detained at \u201creeducation camps.\u201d\n\nPence\u2019s blunt words to Suu Kyi represent the strongest statement from the Trump administration against the atrocities that have driven more than 700,000 Rohingya Muslims from their homeland.\n\nBut Trump has not spoken publicly about Myanmar since taking office. And experts said Pence\u2019s efforts to draw a line \u2014 and win the release of the two Reuters reporters sentenced to seven years in prison \u2014 will be diluted by Trump\u2019s targeting of U.S. journalists, who he routinely calls the \u201cenemy of the people.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hypocritical,\u201d said Erin Murphy, a consultant on Myanmar who accompanied Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on a trip to the country in 2012. \u201cWhat happened to the Reuters journalists is terrible. Jim Acosta is not in jail \u2014 is that where the difference is?\u201d\n\nSuu Kyi and other top Myanmar officials have referred to stories about the violence, which the U.N. last year labeled \u201cethnic cleansing,\u201d as \u201cfake news\u201d \u2014 echoing Trump\u2019s rhetoric.\n\n\u201cIf I were the Myanmar government or Aung San Suu Kyi,\u201d Murphy said, \u201cI would throw it back in Pence\u2019s face.\u201d\n\nWhite House officials have countered criticism that Trump does not promote human rights by pointing to cases of individuals who have been freed under his watch, including three Americans detained in North Korea.\n\nBut the president\u2019s reaction to the death of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi last month led to widespread recriminations. Trump initially cast doubt on evidence that The Washington Post columnist had been killed in a Saudi government-led assassination plot, becoming more critical only in the face of political blowback.\n\nTrump has been more animated when he\u2019s battling White House reporters. On Wednesday, he focused his animus on a lawsuit from CNN claiming that the White House\u2019s treatment of Acosta was a violation of his constitutional rights. Several other media organizations, including The Post, agreed to support the lawsuit.\n\n\u201cIs it freedom of the press when somebody comes in and starts screaming questions and won\u2019t sit down?\u201d Trump said in an interview with the Daily Caller. \u201cHe\u2019s just an average guy . . . who\u2019s got the guts to stand up and shout.\u201d\n\nIn Hong Kong, thousands stood up and shouted during protests in July against the Communist Party\u2019s growing influence over the island, 21 years after the British relinquished control. The party has recently jailed several prominent dissidents.\n\nThomas Shannon, a longtime State Department official who served briefly as acting secretary of state last year, praised the Trump administration for speaking out about the abuses in Myanmar and Hong Kong.\n\nHe was hesitant to connect those statements to Trump\u2019s rhetoric, which he said was rooted in campaign politics. But pointing to the Khashoggi case, Shannon, who retired in July, said the White House will learn that issues around press freedoms \u201ccannot be ignored or pushed away.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can understand the concerns that the president\u2019s rhetoric and the way he has treated the press can sometimes appear to give succor to authoritarians elsewhere to do that,\u201d Shannon said.\n\nAcosta, he added, \u201chasn\u2019t been arrested and sent to prison \u2014 yet.\u201d\n\n", "MEXICO CITY \u2014 Yupik the polar bear died after spending more than 25 years in a barren enclosure at a warm Mexican zoo, and activists said Wednesday the zoo had resisted efforts to transfer her to a more suitable climate.\n\nThe Benito Juarez zoo in the city of Morelia in western Mexico said Yupik died at 27. It said Yupik died of an aneurism and a ruptured aorta, and called the death \u201cinevitable.\u201d\n\nThe zoo said in a statement the death was caused by \u201cnatural ailments of an older animal, and Yupik had lived longer than the average lifespan of her species in the wild, of 15 to 18 years.\u201d\n\nAnimal rights activists claim officials had resisted efforts to transfer Yupik from the zoo, where average daily highs seldom drop below 70 degrees (21 Celsius).

Worse, many in his party go right along with his baseless charges of fraud.\n\nWe are in for a difficult two years. Surviving them will require that Republican senators take seriously the pledge they made in their oath of office to \u201csupport and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic.\u201d What we have seen so far is not encouraging.\n\nFlorida brings out the worst in Republicans. They find it hard to break bad habits developed during the 2000 presidential election, during which they were willing to use any means necessary (including a 5-to-4 Supreme Court decision rooted far more in partisanship than law) to prevent Democrat Al Gore from getting a recount. The contest was ultimately settled by 537 votes.\n\nWith a margin that close, a recount would have been routine in a race for agriculture commissioner. But not for the country\u2019s most important office. The GOP stopped the recounts, and George W. Bush became president.\n\nTo its credit, Florida now requires automatic recounts when races are decided by narrow margins. And this year, Republicans shouldn\u2019t have much to worry about. In the U.S. Senate contest, as of Wednesday morning, Republican Gov. Rick Scott enjoyed a 12,562-vote lead over Democratic incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson. In the governor\u2019s race, Republican Rep. Ron DeSantis led Democrat Andrew Gillum by 33,684 votes. Unless something is badly amiss \u2014 in which case a recount is imperative \u2014 such margins would typically survive close scrutiny.\n\nBut Trump would have none of it. \u201cThe Florida election should be called in favor of Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis in that large numbers of new ballots showed up out of nowhere, and many ballots are missing or forged,\u201d he tweeted on Monday. \u201cAn honest vote count is no longer possible \u2014 ballots massively infected. Must go with Election Night!\u201d\n\nWell. For starters, as The Post\u2019s Fact Checker noted, overseas and military ballots postmarked by Election Day are accepted as long as 10 days after the voting. So Trump, the day after Veterans Day, was suggesting that many of the ballots sent in by our service members not be counted at all. The Post also found no evidence for Trump\u2019s \u201cmissing or forged\u201d charge. And what, pray, is an \u201cinfected\u201d ballot?\n\nThen there was Trump\u2019s tweet last Friday suggesting that \u201ca new Election\u201d might be required in Arizona as Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema passed Republican Rep. Martha McSally in the vote count of their U.S. Senate race. With her golden retriever Boomer at her side, McSally ignored Trump and graciously conceded to Sinema in a video on Monday. McSally is clearly thinking beyond the Trumpian present.\n\nAll this is about more than Trump\u2019s obvious meltdown since an election that was bad for him and his party \u2014 and gets worse as more votes are tallied. It is about whether Republicans are willing to contain and, when necessary, oppose a man who repeatedly demonstrates hostility to the rules, norms and constraints of constitutional democracy.\n\nIt was, thus, good news this week when 14 conservative and libertarian lawyers announced the formation of a new organization called Checks and Balances. Its ranks include George T. Conway III , who happens to be the husband of White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, and former homeland security secretary and Pennsylvania governor Tom Ridge.\n\nTheir organizing statement declared the group\u2019s dedication to \u201cthe rule of law, the power of truth, the independence of the criminal justice system, the imperative of individual rights, and the necessity of civil discourse.\u201d\n\nTellingly, they insisted that their commitment to these principles applied \u201cregardless of the party or persons in power\u201d and reflected their faith in \u201cfree speech, a free press, separation of powers and limited government.\u201d\n\nUp to now, conservatives opposed to Trump have had little impact on their party. Too many, especially among elected officials, have pulled their punches in the crunch and fallen silent under pressure.\n\nThe test will be whether four or five GOP senators prove willing to break with Trump\u2019s apologists in their party\u2019s leadership when it matters \u2014 and when it\u2019s hard. Defending the Florida recount as legitimate and necessary would be a good start. So would supporting a bill protecting special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigation and insisting that his findings be made public. Lovely words about the truth and the rule of law are powerless against a president who respects neither.\n\nRead more from E.J.

It probably is impossible for schools or government to devise rules-based assessments that tightly limit the discretion that admissions offices exercise, given the unavoidable imprecision of the open-textured legal language quoted above, and given the needs of schools\u2019 subgroups \u2014 the orchestra, the athletic teams, the classics department, etc.\n\nHarvard\u2019s practices, say the plaintiffs, who include some aggrieved Asian Americans, constitute racial discrimination that has the intended effect of suppressing admissions of people such as them: Asian American applicants are rejected in spite of objective academic attainments that would result in admissions for African Americans, Hispanics or whites. So, when Harvard\u2019s president is \u201cunequivocal\u201d that his institution \u201cdoes not discriminate against anybody\u201d in admissions, this looks like hypocrisy, understood as the tribute that vice pays to virtue.\n\nExcept that progressives and their institutions long since stopped believing that colorblind policies are virtuous. And regarding admissions, they might have a point.\n\nStuart Taylor Jr., a legal analyst as temperate as he is accomplished, argues (in the Weekly Standard) that racial preferences can ratify stereotypes when \u201cholistic\u201d evaluations emphasize personality traits that are supposed group attributes. There really are, however, attributes that are disproportionately prevalent among various groups at various times. Families are the primary transmitters of social capital \u2014 the habits and mores conducive to flourishing \u2014 and family cultures that produce applicants with stellar objective academic attainments should be encouraged. However, relying exclusively on objective academic metrics (Taylor notes that only Caltech does this; its student body is more than 40 percent Asian) would substantially reduce the number of blacks and Hispanics admitted. Harvard\u2019s own conclusion, in a document presented in the trial, is that admissions based solely on academic metrics would result in a student body that is 43 percent Asian American and less than 1 percent African American.\n\nEight decades ago, Harvard put itself and the nation on the path toward one understanding of meritocracy by emphasizing in admissions the Scholastic Aptitude Test. This was done partly to reduce discrimination against Jewish applicants from family cultures that stressed academic attainments, and partly to dilute favoritism toward the inherited privileges of wealthy families funneling boys through prestigious prep schools.\n\nHarvard\u2019s problem today is a version of America\u2019s, the tension between two problematic approaches to providing opportunities \u2014 \u201cmeritocracy\u201d that is clearly but too simply quantified, and a less tidy but more nuanced measurement of the mixture of merits that serves a university\u2019s, and society\u2019s, several purposes. The optimum result of the court case might already be occurring in voluntary, prudential adjustments of elite university practices to forestall government interventions that would serve shifting agendas of various constituencies. The adjustments would include admissions policies more welcoming to academic excellence regardless of other attributes of those who manifest it, and more sensitivity regarding the felt injustices that inevitably accompany admission disparities produced by preferences, however benignly intended.\n\nRead more from George F.

In the state\u2019s primary elections earlier this year, 90 percent of ballots were cast by mail.\n\nThe lawsuit states Love and her campaign \u201cdo not anticipate a large number of challenges\u201d but that poll monitors \u201chave observed myriad instances where a county worker verified a signature on a ballot envelope that did not appear to match the signature on file with the County.\u201d\n\nThe Salt Lake County Clerk\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment.

(Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nThe campaigns of Brian Kemp and Stacey Abrams on Wednesday accused each other of trying to \u201csteal\u201d the election as the Georgia governor\u2019s race remained unsettled, with both sides awaiting court decisions on thousands of uncounted ballots.\n\nKemp, a Republican whose lead has shrunk a bit each day since the Nov. 6 election, continued to demand that Democratic candidate Abrams concede, arguing that there are not enough outstanding votes for her to force a runoff.\n\n\u201cStacey Abrams and her radical backers will stop at nothing to undermine democracy and attempt to steal this election to be Georgia's next governor,\u201d Kemp spokesman Cody Hall said in a news release.\n\nLauren Groh-Wargo, Abrams\u2019s campaign manager, accused Kemp, the former secretary of state, of using that office \u201cas a taxpayer-funded arm of his campaign. \u2026 That is such an egregious breach of public trust and an egregious breach of power and straight-up corruption.\u201d\n\nAbrams, the former Democratic leader of the Georgia House of Representatives, has declined to concede. On Wednesday, the campaign said Abrams needed more than 17,700 additional votes to force a runoff or more than 15,400 to force a recount. The secretary of state could certify the results Friday.\n\nLate Wednesday, the Abrams campaign won a partial victory in federal court, when U.S. District Judge Steve C. Jones ruled that the state\u2019s 159 counties must accept absentee ballots with minor discrepancies. It was immediately unclear how many votes would be affected by the ruling.\n\nJones denied a request in the lawsuit filed Monday by the campaign and the Democratic Party of Georgia that would have required counties to accept provisional ballots cast by voters in counties where they did not live. The Abrams campaign argued that thousands of voters who showed up at the polls on election day were forced to use provisional ballots because elections officials had not updated their voter files.\n\nHall, in his statement, accused Abrams of pursuing \u201cdangerous lawsuits that attempt to rewrite election law, count illegal votes and create new ones.\u201d\n\nGroh-Wargo joined several lawmakers at the state Capitol on Wednesday for a news conference, during which speakers called on the new secretary of state, Robyn A. Crittenden, to make sure that every vote is counted. She said if Kemp was \u201csecure \u2026 in his determination that he is the winner,\u201d then he would not object to efforts to make sure that votes cast are counted.\n\n[Georgia senator protesting over voter counts said she was arrested because she\u2019s black]\n\nAbrams, who called Kemp the \u201carchitect of voter suppression,\u201d blasted him for refusing to resign as the state\u2019s top elections official while he ran for governor. Kemp was harshly criticized by voting rights advocates for restrictive laws and policies that rejected tens of thousands of voter registrations and purged more than a million from the voting rolls. Several of those laws and policies were stopped by the courts because they were found to be in violation of the federal Voting Rights Acts.\n\n\u201cIf Stacey Abrams doesn\u2019t win in Georgia, they stole it,\u201d Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) said during the National Action Network\u2019s legislative and policy conference Wednesday in Washington.\n\nKemp\u2019s lead has gone from about 75,000 votes on Election Day to just under 55,000, out of more than 3.9 million ballots cast. He currently has 50.23 percent of the vote to 48.83 percent for Abrams. Libertarian candidate Ted Metz has 0.95 percent of the vote.\n\nKemp declared victory last Thursday and has since issued frequent vote tallies, culled from the secretary of state\u2019s website, to show that he remains ahead. In one such calculation, he said that even if Abrams were to get all of the outstanding provisional votes, he would still end up with the required 50.1 percent to win.\n\nThe Abrams campaign has disputed the office\u2019s report that 21,190 provisional ballots were issued. Groh-Wargo has said that more than 26,000 ballots were issued, based on information the campaign has collected from individual counties.\n\nNearly 1.5 million more voters cast ballots in last week\u2019s gubernatorial race than in 2014. Voters in large precincts in the Atlanta suburbs faced hours-long waits caused by too few or malfunctioning voting machines. Voters also reported their names not being on voting rolls and poll workers giving inaccurate information about whether they could use provisional ballots.\n\nTuesday was the official deadline for Georgia\u2019s 159 counties to certify their results, and the secretary of state\u2019s office had planned to certify the results on Wednesday.\n\nBut on Monday, a federal judge barred the secretary of state from certifying until Friday, siding with advocates who said voters were not given enough time and information on how to address problems with their provisional ballots. On Tuesday, a judge ordered Gwinnett County to review rejected absentee ballots on which the voters' birth years were missing or incorrect.\n\nGwinnett County, a suburb of Atlanta, is of particular interest in the race for the 7th Congressional District, where Democrat Carolyn Bourdeaux trailed Republican Rob Woodall by 533 votes as of Wednesday afternoon.", "President Trump threw his support Wednesday behind legislation that would loosen some mandatory minimum sentencing laws \u2014 a measure backed by powerful Senate Republicans and Democrats, but which could run into opposition from some tough-on-crime conservatives.\n\nAt an afternoon event at the White House, Trump officially endorsed the First Step Act, which he said included \u201creasonable sentencing reforms while keeping dangerous and violent criminals off our streets.\u201d He urged lawmakers to send him a bill, saying: \u201cI\u2019ll be waiting with a pen.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s announcement shows that true bipartisanship is possible,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThis is a big breakthrough for a lot of people. . . .

That provision would not be allowed to take place retroactively, a major concession from Democrats.\n\nIt also would include Senate language that retroactively applies the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, which reduces the disparity in sentencing guidelines between crack and powder cocaine offenses. And it would reduce mandatory minimum sentences that go into effect when a firearm is used during a violent crime or drug offense. The latter also would not apply to people already sentenced for these crimes.\n\nIn addition, the agreement lets judges take advantage of \u201csafety valves\u201d \u2014 which allow them to issue sentences shorter than mandatory minimums for low-level crimes \u2014 in more cases.\n\nTrump was privately briefed on the legislation\u2019s contents at a meeting Tuesday.

Matt Bevin is recognized by President Trump, not pictured, during the \"Our Pledge to America's Workers\" event in the State Dining Room of the White House in Washington on Oct. 31. (Al Drago/Bloomberg)\n\nKentucky Gov. Matt Bevin (R) has been forthright about what he believes are the root causes of mass shootings. A few months ago, he blamed gun violence on children\u2019s access to smartphones, video games and psychotropic drugs.\n\nMost recently, he blamed society\u2019s obsession with a specific genre of violent entertainment.\n\n\u201cSeriously, what\u2019s the most important topic that seems to be in every cable television network for example? Television shows are all about what? Zombies,\u201d he said in an interview Tuesday with conservative Kentucky radio host Leland Conway.\n\nMass shootings point to deep cultural problems, Bevin said, particularly in a society that consumes daily doses of violence through the media. He acknowledged tying zombie shows to gun violence might be perceived as \u201ctrite and simplistic.\u201d But, he argued, American culture is \u201cinundated by the worst things that celebrate death,\u201d including the forms of entertainment young people consume.\n\n\u201cThese are drips, drips, drips on the stones of the psyches of young generations that are growing up in a society that increasingly said this is normal and okay,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd eventually, some of those young minds are not going to be able to handle it.\u201d\n\n[\u2018It can\u2019t be any worse\u2019: Thousand Oaks grieves after massacre as questions remain about gunman]\n\nBevin talked about what he believes causes mass shootings during a portion of the interview about the future of gun rights with Democrats controlling the House. Democrats, some of whom ran on a promise to push for gun control, are taking over the House on the heels of another mass shooting in which 12 people were killed inside a California bar. Some who escaped the rampage are survivors of an earlier mass shooting that killed 58 people at a country music festival in Las Vegas last year.\n\nLast month, a gunman stormed inside a synagogue in Pittsburgh and killed 11 congregants \u2014 the deadliest attack on Jews in the history of the country.\n\nBevin did not mention these recent shootings during the interview, though he said there have been incidents in Kentucky.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had things that are fueled by both people that are insane, people that are hateful and people that are just bent on wreaking havoc and perpetuating evil,\u201d he said.\n\n[The lives lost in the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting]\n\nLast June, Bevin participated in a roundtable discussion about gun violence, the root cause of which, he said, are the ways society poisons the minds of children.\n\nHe said violent television shows and video games have desensitized young people, and their access to cellphones have made them prone to self-harm and depression. Young people, he said, are then medicated with psychotropic, mind-altering drugs.\n\n\u201cAnd then we\u2019re shocked, for reasons that are beyond me, that children act out this way. And yes, it\u2019s only a few. But my gracious, it only takes a few,\u201d he said.\n\nThe roundtable was convened by a school safety commission President Trump created in the wake of a school shooting in which 17 people were killed in Parkland, Fla., early this year.\n\nRead more:\n\nSuspect in Pittsburgh synagogue shooting charged with 29 counts in deaths of 11 people\n\nGeorgia senator protesting over voter counts said she was arrested because she\u2019s black\n\nSteve King dared a conservative magazine to release audio of him calling immigrants \u2018dirt.\u2019 It did.", "Movie critic\n\nRating:\n\nThe title of \u201cGreen Book\u201d derives from a period when African Americans often traveled at their own risk, especially in the Jim Crow South. Unwelcome in many restaurants, hotels and other public establishments, they even faced death in \u201csundown\u201d towns, where they were warned to get out before evening, or else. In response, a postal employee named Victor Hugo Green created a guide designed to \u201cgive the Negro traveler information that will keep him from running into difficulties, embarrassments and to make his trips more enjoyable.\u201d The Green Book was published for more than 30 years, finally ceasing publication in the late 1960s.\n\nThe pain, peril and murderous racism that made the Green Book a necessity of black life seems like unlikely fodder for a crowd-pleaser that plays like gangbusters. But \u201cGreen Book,\u201d a spirited amalgam of buddy comedy, road movie, fish-out-of-water fable and accessible social history, is just that cinematic unicorn. As an inspiring and thoroughly entertaining chapter drawn from all-too-real life, it mixes authenticity and Hollywood schmaltz with ease that feels both relaxed and judiciously calibrated. Most winningly, \u201cGreen Book\u201d puts two of the finest screen actors working today in a sexy turquoise Cadillac, letting them loose on a funny, swiftly-moving chamber piece bursting with heart, art and soul.\n\nThe actors in question are Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali, who prove to be a superbly balanced team. Mortensen plays Tony \u201cLip\u201d Vallelonga, a Bronx bouncer who in 1962 is making his living at a New York nightclub and trying to avoid working as muscle for the local mob. When he loses his job, he makes ends meet by putting his prodigious appetite to use in a hot dog-eating contest, which even he, being slightly dimwitted, realizes isn\u2019t a sustainable model. Eventually, he answers a call from a Manhattan musician looking for a driver and shows up at his would-be employer\u2019s Carnegie Hall address ready to take anything that pays.\n\nWhat he finds is a man named Don Shirley (Ali), a supremely elegant pianist and composer who greets Tony draped in regal robes, then conducts the interview from what looks like an ancient Egyptian throne. Shirley, a favorite of Park Avenue and other well-heeled precincts, has booked some dates throughout the South in a tour that will end around Christmas. Although his distinctive brand of bespoke, classically infused jazz is popular with white audiences, he\u2019s not taking any chances: He hires Tony to act both as chauffeur and protector should any difficulties, embarrassments or less-than-enjoyable circumstances arise.\n\nThe ensuing journey unfolds much as the audience might expect: The slovenly, tough-talkin\u2019 Tony and the quiet, impeccably mannered \u201cDr. Shirley\u201d almost immediately begin to bicker about everything from the music Tony listens to in the car to the cigarettes he smokes between his incessant chatter. But \u201cGreen Book,\u201d which was co-written by Vallelonga\u2019s son Nick, turns out to be much more than \u201cThe Odd Couple\u201d meets \u201cDriving Miss Daisy.\u201d Surely Nick\u2019s own intimate knowledge of the real-life lead players helps lend \u201cGreen Book\u201d its sense of groundedness, not to mention the distinctive characters of two larger-than-life men. What\u2019s more, it makes sure to give the audience permission to laugh, even as the stakes of Shirley\u2019s trip become dangerously high.\n\nAs might be expected, Tony and Dr. Shirley meet their fair share of physical danger in \u201cGreen Book,\u201d but it\u2019s the psychic blows that wound the most: Although at first the uncouth Tony may not understand Dr. Shirley\u2019s genius at the piano \u2014 as well as his sophisticated sense of etiquette and comportment \u2014 even he can recognize the hypocrisy of applauding someone\u2019s talent one minute, then relegating him to an outdoor lavatory the next. But it\u2019s not as if Dr. Shirley is any more at home among the mostly black servers, bartenders and domestic staff that he encounters in a world where a man like him \u2014 black, brilliantly educated and, one scene suggests, gay \u2014 can find little if any purchase.\n\nIt will surprise no one to learn that both Tony and Dr. Shirley undergo powerful transformations in \u201cGreen Book,\u201d which begins with a scene of Tony throwing out two water glasses used by black workmen hired by his wife, Dolores (Linda Cardellini), and which also includes a scene of Tony encouraging his ever-so-proper employer to eat a piece of fried chicken with his hands. If that image sounds horribly cringeworthy, it\u2019s a tribute to director Peter Farrelly and to Mortensen and Ali that what could be a fatally misbegotten exercise winds up being unexpectedly warm and amusing.\n\nFarrelly, best known for directing such comedies as \u201cDumb and Dumber\u201d and \u201cThere\u2019s Something About Mary\u201d with his brother Bobby, has never been known as subtle, or for caring much about what his movies looked like. But \u201cGreen Book\u201d is an exceptionally pleasant experience, both visually and aurally, photographed in rich period hues by Sean Porter and drenched in gorgeous music by both Shirley and composer Kris Bowers. It was Bowers, reportedly, who coached Ali in the finger movements that look so convincing in the film, especially during a fabulously boisterous interlude set at a hopping juke joint.\n\nBut all the technical prowess in the world wouldn\u2019t be able to overcome iffy casting in a film that lives or dies by its two central performances. In that regard, Mortensen and Ali take ownership of \u201cGreen Book\u201d early on and make it entirely theirs. Mortensen has always been an appealing, versatile actor, but here he discovers untold layers of humor (and belly fat) to lean in to Tony\u2019s alternately grating and hilarious naivete. Playing off Mortensen\u2019s expansive lack of self-consciousness, Ali is all controlled interior, communicating as much in a glance or a raised finger as with a pages-long monologue.\n\nThe cumulative result of so many things going for it is that \u201cGreen Book\u201d fires on all cylinders, creating the kind of satisfying mainstream moviegoing experience that many observers thought Hollywood had forgotten how to make. There was a time when \u201cGreen Book\u201d might have been the tale of a racist-with-a-heart-of-gold being redeemed by a too-good-to-be-true African American shaman or self-sacrificing paragon. No one is redeemed here, just given space to develop mutual respect and affection. The great success of \u201cGreen Book\u201d lies in its modesty, and the straightforward way it recognizes seismic change in the incremental turning of a human heart.", "* Winter weather advisory from 4 a.m. until 1 p.m. Thursday, excluding Southern Maryland *\n\n[Winter weather advisory for mix of sleet, snow and rain on Thursday.

That provision would not be allowed to take place retroactively, a major concession from Democrats.\n\nIt also would include Senate language that retroactively applies the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, which reduces the disparity in sentencing guidelines between crack and powder cocaine offenses. And it would reduce mandatory minimum sentences that go into effect when a firearm is used during a violent crime or drug offense. The latter also would not apply to people already sentenced for these crimes.\n\nIn addition, the agreement lets judges take advantage of \u201csafety valves\u201d \u2014 which allow them to issue sentences shorter than mandatory minimums for low-level crimes \u2014 in more cases.\n\nTrump was privately briefed on the legislation\u2019s contents at a meeting Tuesday.

Conway III, husband of White House counselor Kellyanne Conway. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\nOpinion writer\n\nPlenty of evidence suggests that democratic norms are eroding and faith in democracy itself is decline. However, let\u2019s not overlook some very healthy signs \u2014 not the least of which is a record turnout in the midterm elections.\n\nFirst, votes are being counted in Florida, regardless of President Trump\u2019s hugely inappropriate tweets trying to undermine that process. Both sides have access from the courts. There will be a final vote. Likewise, a final election result was determined in Arizona, and both sides \u2014 despite irresponsible comments from the National Republican Senatorial Committee \u2014 accepted the legitimacy of the vote count. We\u2019re about to see a peaceful transfer of power in the House of Representatives. Even as some races are still being counted, both parties have accepted the results, even in very close races.\n\nSecond, we are seeing pushback from the right against the president\u2019s lawless conduct. Fox News signed on to CNN\u2019s lawsuit against the president over the revocation of Jim Acosta\u2019s press pass. \u201cFox News supports CNN in its legal effort to regain its White House reporter\u2019s press credential,\u201d Fox News President Jay Wallace said. \u201cWe intend to file an amicus brief with the U.S. District Court.\u201d Wallace continued, \u201cWhile we don\u2019t condone the growing antagonistic tone by both the president and the press at recent media avails, we do support a free press, access and open exchanges for the American people.\u201d (The Post also joined about a dozen outlets in support of the suit and in vowing to submit amicus briefs.)\n\nLikewise, in the legal arena, a new conservative legal group is picking up the slack in light of the Federalist Society\u2019s near-total subservience to the White House, apparently in exchange for an outsized role in picking judges.\n\nThe New York Times reports that a group of conservative lawyers led by George T. Conway III have organized themselves to \u2014 gasp! \u2014 defend conservative legal principles that the president routinely shreds:\n\n\u201cConservative lawyers are not doing enough to protect constitutional principles that are being undermined by the statements and actions of this president,\u201d said John B. Bellinger III, a top State Department and White House lawyer under President George W. Bush. The group, called Checks and Balances, was organized by George T. Conway III, a conservative lawyer and the husband of President Trump\u2019s counselor, Kellyanne Conway. In recent opinion articles, Mr. Conway has criticized Mr. Trump\u2019s statements on birthright citizenship and argued that his appointment of Matthew G. Whitaker to serve as acting attorney general violated the Constitution.\n\nIn a simple statement of its principles, Checks and Balances declares: \u201cWe believe in the rule of law, the power of truth, the independence of the criminal justice system, the imperative of individual rights, and the necessity of civil discourse.\u201d In a Trumpized GOP, those are fighting words. Maybe they\u2019ll even embarrass the Federalist Society, in which these lawyers participate, into adhering to its legal philosophy rather than, by its silence, becoming enablers of a raft of attacks on the rule of law.\n\nAnd finally, a bipartisan group has put out a meaningful list of proposals to reform and bolster democracy.\n\nThe National Task Force on Rule of Law & Democracy, led by such figures as former U.S. attorney Preet Bharara, former Republican New Jersey governor Christine Todd Whitman and former Delaware senator Mike Castle (also a Republican), has put out a batch of ideas ranging from disclosure of presidents\u2019 and vice presidents\u2019 tax returns to legislative enforcement of the emoluments clause to reform of the Office of Government Ethics (giving it power to investigate and punish ethics violations). The task force also recommends extending certain ethics requirements to the president and vice president, empowering inspectors general, protecting special counsels and declaring self-pardons to be illegitimate.\n\nAmong its most important recommendations are new guidelines to restrict White House political appointees from politicizing the Justice Department: \u201c\u2026 legislation should require each administration to identify specific officials, in both the White House and the relevant enforcement agencies, who are authorized to communicate about individual law enforcement matters. This will send a strong message that Congress believes limitations on White House influence are critical to impartial law enforcement. . . . Require law enforcement agencies to maintain a log of contacts with the White House pertaining to specific civil or criminal enforcement matters undertaken by the Justice Department or other federal agencies with enforcement authority.\u201d\n\nWe would hope that Republicans and Democrats \u2014 maybe Mitt Romney (R-Utah) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) in the Senate (the latter of whom worked on the Honest Ads Act with the late Republican senator John McCain) \u2014 would take up these recommendations and pursue them in a bipartisan fashion.\n\nDemocracy is being stressed tested but has not buckled, at least not yet. We should welcome apolitical vote-counting, new interest by the right in enforcement of constitutional norms, and bipartisan efforts to shore up our democracy. Let\u2019s hope others see the merit in and positive attention of such efforts.", "\n\nLONDON, ENGLAND - NOVEMBER 14: Christian Pulisic (second left) of the USA attends a training session ahead of the International Friendly between England and the USA at Wembley Stadium on November 14, 2018 in London, England. (Photo by Catherine Ivill/Getty Images)\n\nLONDON \u2014 Wayne Rooney and Christian Pulisic are 13 years apart, a European in his golden years playing soccer in America and an American in his wonder years excelling in Europe. They do not know one another. They have never stepped onto a pitch at the same time.\n\nBut on Thursday, when England and the United States clash at Wembley Stadium, the soft-spoken English striker and the reticent U.S. attacker will cross paths at a divergent and meaningful moment.\n\nRooney, D.C. United\u2019s summer savior, will take a bow at the fabled theater in a ceremonial farewell to international competition, one year after retiring from the national team. He will enter the friendly sometime in the second half.\n\nPulisic, a sensation from Hershey, Pa., and rising star for German titan Borussia Dortmund, will appear in just his second game for the United States this year. With the U.S. program turning to a wave of young players after failing to qualify for this summer\u2019s World Cup in Russia, Pulisic is inheriting a mantle, relatively speaking, that Rooney had when he burst onto the global scene as a teenager.\n\nOther U.S. players are stepping into prominent roles as well, but with Pulisic\u2019s experiences and abilities, this is his team now.\n\nThe era of Landon Donovan, Clint Dempsey and Tim Howard has passed. The veterans who remain in the mix are not going to change the course of American soccer. Pulisic could.\n\nAlthough he turned 20 this fall \u2014 the age of a college junior \u2014 the program\u2019s hopes and dreams for the next World Cup cycle and beyond will rest largely with him.\n\n\u201cI definitely need to be a more important piece of this team and continue to grow as a leader,\u201d he said Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s important for the team and myself. It\u2019s going to be fun moving forward with these guys.\u201d\n\nPulisic is among several young U.S. players thriving in Europe and MLS. Weston McKennie, featuring regularly with Schalke in the Bundesliga, is another.\n\n\u201cWeston and I are both 20,\u201d Pulisic said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we\u2019re experienced, old guys. We\u2019re in the same boat as a lot of other players.\u201d\n\nBut because Pulisic has accomplished so much so fast \u2014 and been the subject of transfer rumors to big clubs in England and Spain for tens of millions of dollars \u2014 the expectancy to drive the national team, fairly or unfairly, has swelled.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to put too many expectations on Christian,\u201d U.S. interim coach Dave Sarachan said. \u201cTo think that by having him now, all of a sudden, we become a magical group is unfair.\u201d\n\nThe parallels with Rooney, though, are striking. The Englishman debuted with England at age 17 and went on to become the country\u2019s career scoring leader (and Manchester United\u2019s goal king). The burden of expectation on both him and the national team, however, was often too much to bear.\n\n\n\nSoccer Football - England Training - St. George's Park, Burton upon Trent, Britain - November 14, 2018 England's Wayne Rooney during training Action Images via Reuters/Carl Recine\n\nRooney admitted as much this week.\n\n\u201cThere was huge pressure on me and the team to perform,\u201d he said at England training camp. \u201cSometimes that makes you try too hard and be anxious. Sometimes you put too much on yourself and it affects performances. That\u2019s the story of my England career,\u201d in which he never led the Three Lions to a major trophy.\n\nAsking the same of Pulisic, U.S. veteran goalkeeper Brad Guzan said, is asking a lot.\n\n\u201cWayne Rooney, for what he has done for England and his clubs, has been fantastic,\u201d said Guzan, who has played with Pulisic for two years and faced Rooney\u2019s rockets for several in the Premier League. \u201cChristian is still young. He has got a lot of great years ahead of him. Do I think he has the potential to do fantastic things in soccer? Absolutely. But you can\u2019t put that kind of comparison on Christian\u2019s shoulders.\u201d\n\nPulisic said he has admired Rooney for a long time, although, \u201cwhen he was younger, it was hard to follow for me because I was really young. But a guy like that with a successful career is something I can look at. I want to be just like that. I want to have a long career.\n\n\u201cHe was a very passionate guy and I loved watching that. He worked so hard. My dad [who was an influential figure in Pulisic\u2019s formative years] always told me he was a good guy to look up to.\u201d\n\nDespite his peaceful disposition, Rooney captained both England and Manchester United. He now wears the armband for D.C. United.\n\nPulisic\u2019s leadership ability will come more by example than rousing speeches.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough because I am not a very vocal guy,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to show these guys how it\u2019s done at a professional level. I want to go in and be focused every day in training. If guys see that, they will want to do the same thing.\u201d\n\nPulisic will lead in his own way, Guzan said.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t force something upon someone. They either take it or they don\u2019t, or they go about it in their own way. I think he is one of those guys who takes responsibility upon himself, but at the same time, he is not going to change his personality just because there are a bunch of young players coming through.\u201d\n\nU.S. notes: Antonee Robinson, the English-born defender, will miss about four weeks with a sprained ankle suffered at U.S. training Tuesday. . . .

Bush or Al Gore would be the next president.\n\nThis year, they are studying how voters loop their Hs.\n\nA federal judge in Tallahassee heard arguments Wednesday about whether election officials may toss 4,000 ballots with signatures that don\u2019t match existing voter records. The suit was brought by Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.), who is hoping to overtake Republican Gov. Rick Scott in a statewide recount. It is one of many lawsuits flying in state and federal court in the closely watched Senate race, which remains unresolved more than a week after Election Day.\n\nVoter signatures have taken on outsize importance because they are typically required on absentee and mail-in ballots, which more and more Americans are using to vote. As Republicans and Democrats spar over which ballots should count in unresolved elections in Florida and Georgia, many of their disputes have centered on whether to accept ballots where the signature doesn\u2019t match.\n\nThe issue is acute in close races where absentee ballots could sway the outcome \u2014 and in states where voting by mail has exploded without a standardized system for checking the validity of a signature, the most common way to verify that a mail-in ballot is legal.\n\n\n\nPatrick Murphy, a former Democratic congressman from Florida, had his most recent vote-by-mail ballot rejected for a signature discrepancy. (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)\n\nAll of it has created an uproar among voting-rights advocates, who say that untrained election workers are tossing eligible ballots, often with no chance for the voter to object or fix the ballot.\n\n\u201cI had zero recourse here,\u201d said Patrick Murphy, a former Democratic congressman from Palm Beach who learned after the election that his absentee ballot had been rejected because of a mismatched signature \u2014 too late for him to do anything about it.\n\nMurphy, 35, said he\u2019s had the same signature since he got his driver\u2019s license at 16, so he thinks it\u2019s ridiculous that his ballot was tossed. \u201cIn elections, especially in Florida, that are within .5 percent or .25 percent, to have nonexperts be deciding this, seems a little silly to me,\u201d he said.\n\nThe issue is increasingly the subject of litigation elsewhere, too. In a Georgia case similar to the one heard Wednesday in Florida, a federal judge ordered officials to stop summarily tossing absentee ballots without giving voters a chance to fix them. Georgia election officials are still counting provisional and absentee ballots in a contentious governor\u2019s race in which Democrat Stacey Abrams is hoping to force a runoff against Republican Brian Kemp.\n\nOpinions on the issue are divided starkly along partisan lines, with Democrats arguing for more recourse for voters and Republicans defending strict laws to guard against voter fraud.\n\n\n\nIn 2000, a Broward County Canvassing Board member, Broward County Circuit Court Judge Robert Rosenberg, uses a magnifying glass to examine a disputed ballot during the recount for the presidential election. (Alan Diaz/AP)\n\n\u201cThe signature requirement is a good requirement,\u201d said Republican Carlos A. Gim\u00e9nez, mayor of Miami-Dade, Florida\u2019s largest jurisdiction with about 1.4 million registered voters. He said people known as \u201cballot runners\u201d have improperly filled out ballots belonging to the elderly with their own choice.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a very useful law,\u201d he said.\n\nDemocrats noted that most rejected ballots come from communities of color, which tend to vote Democratic. They say that is why Republicans favor strict signature laws despite no widespread evidence of voter fraud. Kemp, for instance, fought the court decision in Georgia.\n\n\u201cThey are not effective anti-fraud measures,\u201d said Democratic lawyer Marc Elias, who is leading some of the litigation in Florida this week. \u201cThey are disenfranchisement measures. There is nothing in the Constitution that qualifies the right to vote with a consistent signature.\u201d\n\nIn Florida\u2019s Palm Beach County, attorney Bill Abramson described a painstaking process in which election officials, known as the canvassing board, sit at a table, surrounded by lawyers and party representatives, and study each ballot one at a time, trying to reach consensus about whether each one is valid.\n\n\u201cIf you do this for a while, it\u2019s not that hard,\u201d said Abramson, who was there to monitor vote-counting in Palm Beach County on behalf of his friend, Democrat Jim Bonfiglio, whose race for the Florida State House is the closest in the state, with a margin of just 37 votes. \u201cYou don\u2019t need an expert to say \u2018that one\u2019s not even close.\u2019 You look for consistencies, the way people hook their H on the left side, that sort of thing. And you compare them.\u201d\n\nAbramson lauded the board\u2019s work and said he objected to only four decisions out of 1,800 ballots. One rejected provisional ballot he thought should have gone through was from an 87-year-old woman who had tried to vote in person.\n\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t have her picture ID, so they asked for her signature, and the signature she had on file was God knows how old, so they said it didn\u2019t match,\u201d Abramson said. \u201cI thought they looked really close. I mean, look, she\u2019s 87, her writing is going to change. My signature has been on file since 1992, and it looks nothing like that today.\u201d\n\n'It's a balancing act'\n\nThirty-six states mandate signature matching on absentee or mail-in ballots, according to Gerry Langeler of the National Vote at Home Institute, a nonprofit organization that advocates for mail-in voting and encourages standardized systems to assess ballot signatures.\n\nMost states have had these requirements for years. The attention on the issue this year is less a function of new laws than the explosion in mail-in voting, notably among older and disabled voters who struggle to vote in person.\n\nIn 2010, 20 percent of all ballots were mailed, Langeler said, and the figure has been growing steadily since; this year, the figure will be at least 28 percent.\n\nNowhere in U.S. society are signatures subject to the scrutiny they receive in elections. Signatures are essential on checks, mortgage documents and credit card receipts \u2014 but it doesn\u2019t really matter how they look.\n\nThey often look pretty bad. No one objects when shoppers leave an illegible squiggle on an electronic keypad to pick up groceries or a prescription. And penmanship has become markedly worse among younger Americans, who spend far more time texting than writing in cursive. Some schools don\u2019t even teach it anymore.\n\nPeople\u2019s signatures also evolve over time, and disabilities can make it difficult for voters to write at all.\n\nDepending on the state, voter signatures are compared to records from ballot applications, registration forms and even sometimes to a years-old driver\u2019s license \u2014 a signature often absent-mindedly scrawled onto an electronic keypad.\n\nThat creates the risk that legal votes will be disqualified, advocates say.\n\n\u201cElection officials need to be very careful when they decide to reject absentee ballots for such small issues,\u201d said John Powers, an attorney with the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, which helped litigate the signature suit in Georgia. \u201cAnd if they do, they should make some effort to contact the voter and verify the voter\u2019s identity to see if the issue can be resolved before the election.\u201d\n\nElection officials say signature matching is essential to verify the identity of a voter who sends in a ballot by mail. Done right, it can result in minimal rejections, Langeler said. Colorado, for instance, requires all voters to vote by mail \u2014 and requires a two-person, bipartisan team of trained judges to examine every signature rejected by an initial computer scan. They also use several signatures from various records to compare with the ballot.\n\n\u201cYour goal is trying to make sure it\u2019s not a fraudulent ballot, like from somebody in the household of an elderly or disabled person,\u201d said Janine Eveler, director of elections in Cobb County, Ga., where officials had to scour signatures on more than 25,000 mail-in ballots this year. \u201cBut if it\u2019s truly their vote, you want to count that. It\u2019s a balancing act.\u201d\n\nIn Cobb, Eveler has trained her staff to look for similarities in the handwriting on the voter\u2019s registration application as well as the signature stored in the state\u2019s computer system. She believes in giving the benefit of the doubt to the voter, she said \u2014 but that\u2019s her judgment, not a statewide standard. Ultimately, just 23 ballots were rejected because of a mismatched signature in Cobb, not enough to sway the outcome of any election this year.\n\nIt was a different story in neighboring and only slightly larger Gwinnett County, Ga., which rejected hundreds of applications for absentee ballots, which also require a matching signature. That makes the law unfair, advocates said, because voters are treated differently depending on where they live. Judges have agreed in cases in Georgia and New Hampshire.\n\nThere is also the risk of intentional voter suppression, advocates said. Gwinnett has a large minority population, and the majority of absentee-ballot applications rejected in Georgia came from voters of color. Some advocates expressed concern that the computer record that local election officials use to match the ballot signature with the registration also shows a voter\u2019s race \u2014 leaving open the possibility of discrimination.\n\nA Gwinnett County spokesman declined to comment on the issue, citing pending litigation. \u201cBut what I will tell you is that we have been following the law, and when we have received direction from the courts, we have followed that,\u201d said spokesman Joe Sorenson. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what we will continue to do.\u201d\n\nIn New Hampshire, Maureen Heard says she knows exactly why her ballot was rejected \u2014 because she had quickly scrawled her signature on her ballot application, and then more carefully signed the ballot itself.\n\nShe was frustrated that she never got a chance to fix the problem and gladly signed onto a lawsuit from the ACLU.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t find out until months later,\u201d she said, \u201cwhen the ACLU called me, that my ballot had been invalidated because the signature that I had on the envelope was kind of different than the one that I had tossed off when I was asking for the ballot.\u201d\n\nLori Rozsa in Riviera Beach, Fla., Sean Sullivan in Tallahassee and Beth Reinhard in Lauderhill, Fla., contributed to this report.", "MINNEAPOLIS \u2014 Food safety officials are stressing the importance of proper handling and cooking practices amid a nationwide outbreak of drug-resistant Salmonella found in raw turkey, with Thanksgiving approaching.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control last week said the number of reported illnesses has nearly doubled since July to 164.

(WeatherBell.com)\n\nThe calendar might say November, but the weather map thinks its winter.\n\nThanks in part to temperatures 15 to 30 degrees below normal across much of the eastern United States, National Weather Service (NWS) offices have issued winter weather advisories and warnings from Mississippi to Maine as a major storm system continues to take shape.\n\nSnow in the Deep South is rare at any time of year, and especially in November. Yet places including Texas, Arkansas and Louisiana have seen some flakes and even accumulation over the past day as this storm system really begins to gather strength. In some of these places, Houston among them, this snow is the earliest on record. This is on the heels of snow across the Rockies and into the Southern Plains that was largely a result of the same slow-moving system.\n\nA primary cause of this snow unusually far south is the big upper-level low pressure system and its deep pool of cold air. In addition to the snow it has created on its own, the system will eventually spur the development of a new area of low pressure near the coast of the Carolinas on Thursday that will spread heavy rain, ice and snow through the Mid-Atlantic states.\n\nThese two low-pressure zones will ultimately mesh off the coast of New Jersey into Friday, plastering the Northeast with wintry precipitation.\n\nFor now, the first low is continuing to develop across parts of the South and Midwest. A winter storm warning is up in St. Louis and its surroundings, where a half-foot or more of snow is expected to fall.\n\n\u2744\ufe0f\ud83d\ude2c The WINTER STORM WARNING now includes the St. Louis metro area beginning at 6pm this evening until 6pm Thur.

Only an inch or so of snow is forecast for Columbus and Cleveland on Thursday.\n\nMeanwhile, the East Coast low will start riding up the coast in tandem with the parent upper-level low to its west. While the early-season nor\u2019easter is set to deliver more wet than white to the coastal areas, a wintry mix is anticipated in cities from Washington to Boston.\n\n[D.C. area forecast: Season\u2019s first winter storm Thursday will bring slop of sleet, snow and rain. Some slick travel possible.]\n\nHere are snow and sleet accumulation forecasts for these cities, before the expected changeover to plain rain:\n\nWashington: A coating\n\nPhiladelphia: Coating to 1 inch\n\nNew York City: Coating to 1 inch\n\nBoston: 1 to 3 inches\n\nFor those of you commenting that at least there won't be any icing, ahem, there will also be some icing. pic.twitter.com/2bOxyqpFDz \u2014 Gary Szatkowski (@GarySzatkowski) November 14, 2018\n\nHeavier amounts are predicted west of the big cities. At least a few inches of snow is expected along the spine of the mountains from the Virginias northward. The high country of interior Pennsylvania through New York and into New England could see as much as 8 to 12 inches from this winter storm.\n\nWhile this storm is certainly on the early side overall, a city such as Binghamton in the Southern Tier of New York \u2014 where a winter storm watch is in effect \u2014 is no stranger to November snow. As recently as 2016, it picked up 27.6 inches during the month.\n\nTo the south and east of the region of mostly snow, a belt of mixed precipitation is likely near the Interstate 81 corridor, including places such as Winchester, Va., Hagerstown, Md., and Scranton, Pa. In addition to a few inches of snow, ice accumulation of up to 0.25 inch is possible in spots, which may lead to hazardous roads and power outages.\n\n\n\nPrecipitation and snowfall forecasts from the NWS. (National Weather Service)\n\nOn the coast, most of the precipitation will fall as rain. Some spots right on the water may top two inches when all is said and done. More broadly, a large area of significant totals is anticipated up and down the East Coast. Some large waves and beach erosion are likely.", "There\u2019s no good argument underlying President Trump\u2019s insistence that U.S. elections are undermined by rampant voter fraud. There\u2019s no evidence at all that they are, despite years of looking and years of rhetoric like Trump\u2019s. There\u2019s no evidence of rampant voter fraud in Florida in the wake of last week\u2019s midterm elections, either, despite Trump\u2019s tweets and commentary.\n\nBut there are particularly bad arguments for the existence of voter fraud, two of which Trump offered in an interview with the Daily Caller on Wednesday afternoon. The outlet\u2019s Benny Johnson and Saagar Enjeti interviewed Trump in the Oval Office, and the conversation turned to the recount in that state.\n\nHere\u2019s the first claim Trump made, hoping to bolster his assertion that fraud is rampant: \u201cWhen people get in line that have absolutely no right to vote and they go around in circles. Sometimes they go to their car, put on a different hat, put on a different shirt, come in and vote again. Nobody takes anything. It\u2019s really a disgrace what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the second claim he made, hoping to bolster the idea that photo ID should be required at polling places: \u201cIf you buy a box of cereal \u2014 you have a voter ID. They try to shame everybody by calling them racist, or calling them something, anything they can think of, when you say you want voter ID. But voter ID is a very important thing.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s start with that second claim, because it\u2019s funnier.\n\nAmazingly, Trump has made this very odd assertion about needing an ID to buy groceries before. He said something similar in August and, at the time, the media assessed the validity of the claim. It is, uh, not valid. Maybe if you\u2019re paying with a check, if people still do that? But if you want to go into a grocery store and buy some Cheerios using cash or a debit card, go nuts. This is a good example of Trump\u2019s imperviousness to being corrected.\n\nThe latter half of the comment is also true. Voter ID laws disproportionately make it more difficult for people of color to vote. The laws are usually passed by Republican legislatures in part because they tamp down a voting base assumed to support Democrats. In the past, courts have explicitly called voter ID laws in Texas and North Carolina discriminatory.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, voter ID is not generally an important thing because incidents of in-person voter fraud, the type of fraud that such laws are meant to prevent, are so rare. If you click this button, a fraudulent ballot will be found at the same rate as they were determined to appear in actual voting. One will pop up for you, on average, once every 29 hours.\n\nSTART COUNTING BALLOTS\n\nThere have been a lot of efforts to sniff out fraudulent votes, including by Trump. None have found any significant, organized voter fraud.\n\nWhich brings us back to Trump\u2019s first claim, about people voting, leaving the polling place, changing hats and coming back in.\n\nIf you have ever voted, you know how ridiculous this is. While you don\u2019t always need a photo ID to vote, you do need to be registered (in nearly every state) and somehow verify your identity, often by matching your signature against one on file.\n\nUnless you live in a small community in which two people are identified solely by their hat colors, and unless you convince the person at the polling place to ignore your face and just focus on your hat color and unless there are for some reason no other checks to validate your registration, your hat-switching or shirt-changing strategy isn\u2019t going to work.\n\nIt\u2019s sort of amazing that the president of the United States doesn\u2019t know this or pretends he doesn\u2019t.\n\n\n\nClip from \"Access Hollywood\" in 2004. (Access Hollywood) (Philip Bump/New York)\n\nTrump should certainly know how hard it is to vote because he famously had to travel to multiple polling places in 2004 when trying to cast his presidential vote, camera crew in tow. (It was for a show hosted by Billy Bush, who has a habit of starring in videos that don\u2019t cast Trump in the greatest light.) Trump wasn\u2019t on any of the voter registration lists and ultimately had to cast a provisional ballot.\n\nTo be fair, he didn\u2019t try changing his shirt.\n\nThe broader question is why Trump is pushing this obviously untrue assertion about voter fraud. When he made similar claims after the 2016 election, it appeared to be a face-saving move. If millions of people cast votes illegally, the thinking seemed to go, then maybe Trump actually won the popular vote. Here, the goal is different: Trump seems to hope either to curtail the recount in Florida, preserving the narrow leads enjoyed by Republican candidates for the Senate and governor\u2019s seats, or he wants to prepare the ground for objecting to any potential Democratic victories in those races.\n\nOr, maybe, Trump thinks these things are true. They aren\u2019t, but, as mentioned above, he\u2019s impervious to fact-checking. One can picture Trump being told that changing hats won\u2019t fool a poll worker and him waving dismissively. You can probably hear his voice in your head: \u201cEh, it happens, believe me.\u201d\n\nIt doesn\u2019t. Vote fraud almost never happens. You don\u2019t need an ID to buy cereal. You can\u2019t swap hats and magically become another legal voter.\n\nBut here we are talking about it yet again.", "A year ago, Hillary Clinton joined me on my radio show for a long discussion about her memoir of the 2016 presidential race, \u201cWhat Happened?\u201d In September, John F. Kerry \u2014 like Clinton, a former secretary of state \u2014 came on the show to discuss his memoir \u201cEvery Day Is Extra.\u201d\n\nFor both former Democratic presidential nominees, it was their first appearance on a program that has run three hours every weekday for more than 18 years, on any day of which they would have been welcomed with the same courtesy and approach: an interview, not a debate.\n\nWhen he ran for president, Donald Trump joined me by phone more than a dozen times. These were often for long interviews, and never less than 10 minutes. He\u2019s very good at interviews, running over questions he does not care to answer and through journalists who try to steer a conversation artlessly.\n\nTrump won. Clinton and Kerry did not. No, that\u2019s not a correlation of winning the presidency with appearing on my show. Now-senator-elect Mitt Romney (R-Utah) and soon-to-be-retired House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) \u2014 the 2012 GOP presidential-vice presidential nominees \u2014 were frequent guests in 2012, and they didn\u2019t win. But it is a suggestion to would-be Democratic presidential candidates in 2020 that they all start early to seek out frequent interviews with interlocutors from across the political spectrum in settings that allow for more than a minute\u2019s response.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be on my show, though every single one of the two or three dozen serious Democratic would-be nominees is welcome to join me early and often. There are so many serious (and fun) interviews to be had, with straight-down-the-middle journalists such as The Post\u2019s Robert Costa, center-right podcasters including Jamie Weinstein, brilliant young conservatives like Mary Katharine Ham and Guy Benson, or long-standing stalwarts of the talk radio world who would no more insult a guest than they would their family members at Thanksgiving such as Dennis Prager and myself.\n\nOf course, making the rounds of the Sunday shows will be part of the traditional formula, and sitting down for an amiable chat with a late-night host will stroke some of the base\u2019s erogenous zones, but the real gains are to be made in the no man\u2019s land of serious interviews about difficult subjects, sometimes with interviewers who are not likely to be supporters. Some have already realized this: On my program, Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio) \u2014 who has expressed interest in running \u2014 is already an occasional guest. Though neither are yet declared candidates, Sens. Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.) and Angus King (Maine) have also joined me (the latter formally an independent, but so is Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont). Both Coons and King would bring quite a lot to the Democratic race, including this willingness to engage.\n\nPolitical conversation in the United States has entered a zone of toxicity I haven\u2019t seen in a broadcast career that began in 1990 and that has always included radio and often television, for every network, and twice as a host for a total of a dozen years on the small screen and nearly 30 over the radio airways. It will be tempting in the rush to lock down a slice of the robustly engaged left to only go live on air in conversation with friends, if not members of the resistance. But not only do independents get to vote in New Hampshire, they also will do so in many other primary contests and of course in November 2020.\n\nSo go hunting for the chance to answer some tough questions about expanding Medicare or fending off China\u2019s aggression or not withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement.\n\nGo in harm\u2019s way, and win votes, and maybe volunteers and contributors. I wrote last week that President Trump has become extremely deft at the role of \u201ccombatant in chief.\u201d Prepping for him, as for any boxer looking to win a belt, requires a lot of practice sparring. Come early and often, not just to me but anywhere you will be allowed to make a case for change, not unchallenged but always with respect and fair opportunity to answer. There are scores of such places.\n\nYour consultants will say no. Take charge of your own campaign and do so with confidence.

(Peter Barreras/Invision/AP)\n\nGroups with ties to technology titan Mark Zuckerberg are getting even more involved in the political arena, throwing their weight behind a new initiative that would automatically clear the criminal records of eligible offenders without them having to go through a lengthy legal process.\n\nIt\u2019s another step toward engaging with Washington for Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, and is being done in coordination with the Seminar Network, the powerful political arm of the Koch brothers, and the progressive Center for American Progress.\n\nThe Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, founded by Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, and fwd.us, a lobbying group formed by tech industry executives including Zuckerberg, are among several groups with ties to Silicon Valley that are pushing the effort.\n\nThe move comes as President Trump announced his support Wednesday for a separate bipartisan package aimed at overhauling U.S. sentencing laws. He said the \u201cFirst Step Act\u201d would give inmates a \u201csecond chance at life\u201d after serving time.\n\n[Trump endorses bipartisan criminal-justice reform bill]\n\nThe groups plan to unveil the \u201cClean Slate\u201d initiative at an event Thursday in Washington, where Koch Industries General Counsel Mark Holden will appear with David Plouffe, a former senior adviser to President Obama who now serves as the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative\u2019s president of policy and advocacy.\n\nThe effort aims to pass both state and federal legislation that would create digital systems to automatically clear records \u2014 eliminating a time-intensive and costly petition process for those who are eligible.\n\nAlthough separate criminal justice reform may soon be considered in Congress, it\u2019s not clear this new effort will be embraced by House members and senators in the near future.\n\nHolden said this is not the first time the group has worked across party lines on criminal justice reform. He indicated this is one of many areas surrounding the issue, including bail practices, where the Koch network may team up with Silicon Valley.\n\n\u201cThe tech world is going to be essential to reforms in the future,\u201d Holden said in an interview.\n\nClean Slate has already been signed into law in Pennsylvania, and the group is now making a push to ensure other states follow suit.\n\nThe progress in Pennsylvania also caught the eye of Plouffe and his team at the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. \u201cThere\u2019s been a big technological challenge here,\u201d Plouffe said.\n\nThe Chan Zuckerberg Initiative helped the development of technology for the effort by providing financial assistance to Code for America, a group that builds technology services for government.\n\nBetween 70 million and 100 million Americans \u2014 as many as one in three \u2014 have some kind of criminal record, according to the Center for American Progress. Many Americans run into trouble with employers, landlords or educational institutions that do background checks in which their criminal records are a major component.\n\nRebecca Vallas, who leads CAP\u2019s work on the issue, said tens of millions of Americans who have committed crimes \u2014 from minor infractions to those that took place long ago \u2014 are eligible to have their records cleared or expunged.\n\nYet to have their records cleared \u2014 and no longer turn up in a background check \u2014 they must undergo an expensive process of petitioning the courts, which frequently requires hiring a lawyer. Many people with criminal records also may not know they are eligible to have their records cleared, she said.\n\nFurthermore, criminal records cross many different digital systems at various levels of government.\n\nVallas teamed up with Sharon Dietrich, a leading employment lawyer in Philadelphia, to push the first Clean Slate law through the Pennsylvania General Assembly. Dietrich said in her work as litigation director and managing attorney at Community Legal Services, requests from eligible people for record clearances were on the rise, especially in the digital age. Those requests only increased as technology makes it faster and easier to perform background checks.\n\n\u201cI had a client who told me it was easier to get a job when he came out of jail in the 1970s than it is to get one now,\u201d Dietrich said. \u201cThe rat race has gotten faster and faster.\u201d\n\nDietrich and her team used to try to clear records manually but soon realized the only way to effectively address the problem was to automatically clear them. After a bipartisan push in Harrisburg, Pa., legislators created a law to do just that.\n\nMichigan, Colorado and South Carolina are among states seeking to follow Pennsylvania\u2019s lead, Vallas said.\n\nIn Michigan, more than 95 percent of records eligible to be cleared have not been successfully expunged or sealed, according to analysis from University of Michigan researchers Sonja Starr and J.J. Prescott.\n\nMuch of the Clean Slate campaign\u2019s momentum is focused on the state level, but a federal effort to create similar legislation for federal criminal records was introduced in August by Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-Del.) and Rep. Rod Blum (R-Iowa), who lost his reelection effort.\n\nThat bill would automatically clear records for eligible marijuana charges and other nonviolent offenses. Rochester is seeking another Republican co-sponsor for the legislation because Blum lost his bid for reelection. She said it will be a difficult push at the federal level.\n\n\u201cAt the federal level, the task is large,\u201d Rochester said in an email. \u201cThe court systems and the Department of Justice do not have a standard protocol for easily communicating across different jurisdictions, but the challenge makes our task even that much more important.\u201d\n\nRead more at PowerPostjk", "Defense Secretary Jim Mattis described the deployment to the border as \u201cgreat training\u201d and told active-duty soldiers in Texas not to pay attention to the news coverage of the operation because they would \u201cgo nuts.\u201d\n\nMattis and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen visited troops near the U.S.-Mexico border on Wednesday, a little over two weeks after President Trump dispatched thousands of active-duty forces in anticipation of a Central American migrant caravan.\n\nCritics assailed Trump for sending such a large contingent of troops to the border ahead of the midterm elections, accusing him of mounting an unnecessary stunt designed to fire up anti-immigration sentiment among his political base.\n\nBut Mattis has defended the operation to support U.S. Customs and Border Protection, saying the American military \u201cdoesn\u2019t do stunts.\u201d His trip on Wednesday escalated that defense into a public relations foray that presented the operation as legal, necessary and run-of-the-mill.\n\nDuring the flight to Texas, Mattis described the operation as a \u201cmoral and ethical mission to support our border patrolmen\u201d and cited previous military operations on the border, dating back to President Woodrow Wilson\u2019s deployment of the U.S. Army there to counteract Mexican revolutionary Pancho Villa\u2019s forces.\n\n\u201cWe determined that the mission was absolutely legal, and this was also reviewed by Department of Justice lawyers,\u201d Mattis said on the plane. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously a moral and ethical mission to support our border patrolmen. There\u2019s nothing new under the sun.\u201d\n\nThe National Guard deployed to the border during the administrations of George W. Bush and Barack Obama to aid the Border Patrol, but active-duty forces haven\u2019t deployed there since counternarcotics missions decades ago.\n\nAfter arriving at Base Camp Donna, Mattis met with soldiers who have been setting up barbed-wire fences to \u201charden\u201d points of entry in anticipation of migrants arriving from caravans headed northward.\n\nThe defense secretary suggested the soldiers should disregard the controversy surrounding the mission that has surfaced in the news media.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s all sorts of stuff in the news, and that sort of thing,\u201d Mattis told a group of soldiers. \u201cYou just concentrate on what your company commander, your battalion commander, tells you. Because if you read all that stuff, you know, you\u2019ll go nuts.\u201d\n\nMattis also sought to present the border deployment as good training for U.S. forces, arguing that the mission would improve their readiness and counteracting criticism that Trump was wasting the time and money of the armed forces for political effect.\n\n\u201cWhat a great training,\u201d Mattis told one of the soldiers in Texas as he walked through the installation with Nielsen. \u201cWe could not have had a better training event.\u201d\n\nTrump announced ahead of the midterms that he would deploy as many as 10,000 to 15,000 troops in anticipation of the caravan\u2019s arrival, actively publicizing a muscular military deployment that played well with his base.\n\nOn Wednesday, some two weeks later, a spokeswoman for U.S. Northern Command said about 5,900 troops were deployed there and significant increases weren\u2019t expected.\n\nNorthern Command previously had said more than 7,000 active-duty troops would be supporting CBP in California, Arizona and Texas. The spokeswoman for the command said Wednesday that estimate had included troops who were in \u201cpreparation for deployment\u201d status. The active-duty forces joined more than 2,000 National Guardsmen who have been deployed to the border since April.\n\nThe Pentagon initially dubbed the active-duty operation \u201cFaithful Patriot.\u201d Mattis later ordered the military to scrap the name and describe the mission as border support.\n\n\u201cWhen the name of the mission first came in, I had given instructions, \u2018I do not want to put this mission in some arcane military terms. If what we\u2019re doing is laying wire, don\u2019t talk about implementing a barrier plan,\u2019\u201d Mattis said.\n\nHe said he wanted the American public to understand what the military is doing and not doing on the border because \u201cthis is a highly politically visible issue.\u201d\n\nMattis said there was still no cost estimate for the mission.\n\nThe military deployment to the border, including the cost of National Guard forces that have been there since April, could climb well above $200 million by the end of 2018 and grow significantly if the deployments continue into next year, according to analysts\u2019 estimates and Pentagon figures. The cost of the National Guard deployment from April 10 through Sept. 30 amounted to $103 million, according to Pentagon figures.\n\nThe total figure for the military operations on the border this year could be lower if the Pentagon keeps the number of active-duty troops hovering around 5,000, rather than the 10,000 or 15,000 Trump had suggested.\n\nThe active-duty border mission is tentatively scheduled to continue until mid-December. Several hundred members of a Central American migrant caravan with about 6,000 people have arrived at the border in Tijuana, Mexico. The rest are expected to arrive over the next several days. Most of the caravan members are Hondurans who say they are fleeing violence and poverty.\n\nTrump, who regularly mentioned the caravan in the days ahead of the midterm elections and warned without evidence that the crowd included \u201csome bad people\u201d and \u201cunknown Middle Easterners,\u201d has largely stopped bringing it up in recent days.\n\nThe troops deployed at the border, meanwhile, have been stringing Slinky-style barbed wire at locations where migrants might arrive in Texas, Arizona and California.\n\nIn Brownsville, Tex., soldiers told The Washington Post on Sunday that such concertina wire is easy to put in place but difficult to remove once its barbed coils are expanded.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big Slinky,\u201d said Staff Sgt. Juan Mendoza, a member of the 887th Engineer Support Company, referring to the toy. \u201cOnce you stretch that Slinky out so much and put a small twist in it, it never goes back the same way.\u201d\n\nOne of the soldiers who spoke with Mattis on Wednesday brought up the matter and asked whether the \u201cwire obstacles\u201d his unit was installing would need to be removed later on. Mattis said right now the task was to put in the wire.\n\nWith regard to removing it, Mattis said, \u201cWe\u2019ll let you know.\u201d\n\nDan Lamothe contributed to this report from Brownsville, Tex.", "Britain\u2019s Prime Minister Theresa May delivers a speech outside 10 Downing Street in London, Wednesday, Nov. 14, 2018.

The \u201cbackstop\u201d plan involves keeping the U.K. in a customs union with the EU until a permanent trade treaty is worked out.\n\nIt\u2019s a breakthrough, but the path to Brexit day \u2014 just over four months away on March 29 \u2014 remains rocky.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at what is likely to happen next:\n\nBEELINE TO BRUSSELS\n\nMay is due to update Parliament on Thursday on what has been agreed, while Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab will likely head to Brussels to meet with chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier.\n\nBarnier declared there has been \u201cdecisive progress\u201d toward a deal \u2014 the phrase that allows EU leaders to call a special summit to approve the deal. They have penciled in a meeting for Nov. 25.\n\nThe deal consists of two parts: a legally binding withdrawal agreement \u2014 which includes the border backstop \u2014 and a looser framework for future relations. The two sides have given themselves a transition period until the end of 2020 to work out the details of future trade ties.\n\nPERIL IN PARLIAMENT\n\nOnce the EU has signed off on it, the deal also must be approved by the European and British parliaments\n\nMay hopes to get it passed by U.K. lawmakers before Christmas. Business groups warn that most U.K. companies will implement Brexit contingency plans \u2014 cutting jobs, stockpiling goods, relocating production \u2014 if there isn\u2019t clarity by then about the terms of Brexit.\n\nBut she faces an uphill battle. May\u2019s Conservative Party doesn\u2019t hold a majority of seats in the House of Commons, and relies on 10 lawmakers from Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party to win votes. But the DUP says it will reject any deal that treats Northern Ireland differently to the rest of the U.K.\n\nSeveral dozen pro-Brexit Conservatives have vowed to oppose any arrangement that keeps Britain in a customs union, and tied to EU trade rules, indefinitely.\n\nThe main opposition Labour Party also says it will oppose any deal that doesn\u2019t offer the same benefits Britain currently has as a member of the EU\u2019s single market and customs union.\n\nMay is calculating that, faced with the prospect of a chaotic \u201cno-deal\u201d exit \u2014 complete with financial turmoil, gridlock at U.K. ports and shortages of essential goods \u2014 most Conservatives and some opposition lawmakers will crumble and support the deal.\n\nUNCHARTED TERRITORY\n\nIf Parliament rejects the deal, Britain enters unknown territory.\n\nLawmakers could try to send the government back to the negotiating table with the EU, though there\u2019s no simple mechanism to make that happen. They could defeat the government in a no-confidence vote in an attempt to trigger a national election.\n\nLawmakers could even vote for a new referendum on EU membership, though it seems unlikely there would be time to hold one before the U.K.\u2019s scheduled departure date. The U.K. will cease to be an EU member on March 29 \u2014 deal or no deal.\n\nIain Begg, a professor at the London School of Economics\u2019 European Institute, said rejection of a deal would trigger a major political crisis because Britain\u2019s patchwork constitution offers no \u201cprescribed way out of that dilemma.\u201d\n\nHe said in that case, \u201cwe really are into a period of great uncertainty about what happens next. I think nobody can know how it would unfold.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Jill Lawless on Twitter at http://Twitter.com/JillLawless\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(Stephanie Keith/Reuters)\n\nOpinion writer\n\nThe Post reports:\n\nReported hate crimes in America rose 17 percent last year, the third consecutive year that such crimes increased, according to newly released FBI data that showed an even larger increase in anti-Semitic attacks. Law enforcement agencies reported that 7,175 hate crimes occurred in 2017, up from 6,121 in 2016. That increase was fueled in part by more police departments reporting hate crime data to the FBI, but overall there is still a large number of departments that report no hate crimes to the federal database. The sharp increase in hate crimes in 2017 came even as overall violent crime in America fell slightly, by 0.2 percent, after increases in 2015 and 2016. . . . Of the more than 7,000 incidents reported last year, 2,013 targeted black Americans, while 938 targeted Jewish Americans. Incidents targeting people for their sexual orientation accounted for 1,130 hate crimes, according to the FBI. . . . Anti-Semitic hate crimes rose 37 percent in 2017. Anti-Islamic hate crimes declined 11 percent last year, with 273 such incidents, the data show.\n\nHowever, it is also the case that not all hate crimes are reported to the FBI. (\u201cSome of last year\u2019s most widely reported hate crime charges \u2014 the confessed assailant who said \u2018get out of my country\u2019 before killing Srinivas Kuchibhotla; the death of Heather Heyer, allegedly by a white supremacist who ran her over in Charlottesville; and the Portland MAX train stabbings, during which the accused attacker was overheard yelling racist slurs \u2014 are not recorded in the FBI report.\u201d) The failure to develop a consistent and reliable reporting system must be rectified.\n\n\u201cTwo weeks ago, we witnessed the most deadly anti-Semitic hate crime in American history,\u201d said Anti-Defamation League CEO and National Director Jonathan A. Greenblatt. \u201cToday, we have another FBI study showing a big jump in hate crimes against Americans because of their race, religion, ethnicity, and sexual orientation. This report provides further evidence that more must be done to address the divisive climate of hate in America. That begins with leaders from all walks of life and from all sectors of society forcefully condemning anti-Semitism, bigotry, and hate whenever it occurs.\u201d\n\nGreenblatt admonished authorities to fix the spotty reporting system: \u201cIt is incumbent on police departments, mayors, governors, and county officials across the country to tally hate crimes data and report it to the FBI. The FBI can only report what the data they receive. We must do more to make sure that cities report credible data.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s apologists deny any connection whatsoever between Trump\u2019s harangues against the so-called caravan and the Pittsburgh slaughter of 11 Jews, whom the alleged murderer said were trying to bring invaders into the country. However, few Americans who are not die-hard Trump cultists would deny that Trump has normalized racist speech, excused white nationalists, \u2014 some \u201cfine\u201d people marched in Charlottesville, he insisted \u2014 equated immigrants with criminals, identified as a \u201cnationalist\u201d himself and fanned the white grievance syndrome.\n\nHowever, it is not only Trump who is responsible. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) refused to pass a resolution condemning Trump\u2019s Charlottesville remarks and has refused to kick Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) out of the caucus even though he met with and embraced the views of Austrian neo-Nazis. Holocaust denier Arthur Jones ran under the GOP banner in Illinois\u2019s 3rd Congressional District (he lost, but received 56,000 votes), as did avowed white-supremacist Russell Walker in a race for the North Carolina state House of Representatives. (Walker also lost.) Corey Stewart ran on a race-baiting, anti-immigrant platform in Virginia for the U.S. Senate (again, he lost) and received praise from Trump.\n\nIn becoming a nativist party and catering to a segment of the electorate that thinks whites have been persecuted, Republicans have encouraged hate-mongers, anti-Semites and white nationalists to come out in the open. Other factors, including social media, contribute to the problem, but nothing so emboldens racists to express their views in non-peaceful ways than to hear political leaders sound dog whistles \u2014 and sometimes bullhorns. The House should hold hearings on the problem, solicit expert advice and \u2014 we would hope in conjunction with the Senate \u2014 take a zero-tolerance position in their own parties when it comes to noxious bigotry. Republicans\u2019 silence makes them complicit; their unwavering support for Trump makes them morally responsible for the surge in hate crimes.\n\nRead more:\n\nWhat\u2019s a defeated or retired Republican to do?\n\nA frightful portrait of a president out of control\n\nCorey Stewart and his race-baiting friends\n\nI\u2019m a black woman.

Five more clubs would be invited to play in what would effectively be a replacement for the Champions League, which shares more than $2 billion each season among 32 clubs but is controlled by UEFA.\n\nThe plan seemed to betray ECA leader Agnelli\u2019s repeated promise of no changes being made to the Champions League before 2024.\n\n\u201cAll parties underlined their commitment to working together toward the development of club competitions under the leadership of UEFA,\u201d the European soccer body said in a statement about Wednesday\u2019s meeting, which did not mention the breakaway project.\n\nEuropean media reports have also detailed how some clubs \u2014 including Manchester City and PSG, backed by owners from royal families in Qatar and Abu Dhabi \u2014 evaded UEFA rules on sponsor deals and spending on transfers and wages.\n\nPSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi, who arrived at UEFA to attend the second half of Wednesday\u2019s meeting, did not stop to talk with reporters.\n\nA proposal to add a third-tier European club competition, while cutting the Europa League group stage from 48 teams to 32, was also analyzed.

(Ennio Leanza/Keystone via AP) (Associated Press)\n\nLUGANO, Switzerland \u2014 Qatar stunned eighth-ranked Switzerland 1-0 in an international friendly on Wednesday as Akram Afif\u2019s late goal gave the 2022 World Cup host a surprising victory.\n\nAfif scored on a breakaway with four minutes remaining to send an early message that 96th-ranked Qatar may be catching up to the more established soccer powers four years before it plays in its first World Cup.\n\nAfter Qatar won possession near the halfway line, Afif ran onto a throughball and rounded goalkeeper Yvon Mvogo before shooting into an empty net.\n\n\u201cWe hope this game gives our players the confidence that we can play against top teams and to keep working hard,\u201d Qatar coach Felix Sanchez said. \u201cI\u2019m sure in Qatar people are very proud of our players today and they\u2019re going to give us more hope to prepare the Asian Cup.\u201d\n\nQatar has another friendly on Monday against Iceland before the Asian Cup in January.

This for a reason,\u201d Sanchez said.\n\nSwitzerland, which reached the last 16 in this year\u2019s World Cup in Russia and had kept nine clean sheets in its past 10 home matches, had wasted a number of chances to put the game away earlier and hit the post twice.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really awful defeat, it\u2019s a match almost to forget.

(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) first won election to the House of Representatives two years ago and since has distinguished himself largely on two metrics: number of appearances on Fox News and \u2014 overlapping a bit \u2014 loyalty to President Trump.\n\nIn that latter vein, Gaetz has embraced the president\u2019s rhetoric about the still-undecided Senate and gubernatorial races in Florida, charging repeatedly on television and on Twitter that Democrats in the state are using illegal ballots to try to steal the election.\n\nIn an interview with Breitbart on Tuesday, he ran through those allegations, framing them in a new context. Gov. Rick Scott (R), who leads incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson (D), and Rep. Ron DeSantis (R), who leads Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum (D), may be \u201coutside the margin of fraud,\u201d but, he claimed, the Democrats are perpetuating fraud anyway so that they know what works to steal the next election. He called it \u201cstress-testing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the Democrats are able to learn now what techniques work and don\u2019t work, what transparency laws are going to be followed and which ones aren\u2019t, then it gives them a road map on how to steal the election from Donald Trump in 2020,\u201d he claimed. \u201cI really think that\u2019s what this is about. The resistance movement has changed from, you know, yelling at town halls to yelling in restaurants and now it\u2019s actually trying to steal elections they can\u2019t win at the ballot box.\u201d\n\n\u201cDemocrats justify anything they do against Trump as being righteous even if it\u2019s morally wrong or even if it\u2019s illegal,\u201d he claimed at another point, \u201cbecause they\u2019re so driven to stop Trump.\u201d\n\nRepublican insistence on following the rules, Gaetz claimed, put them at a disadvantage.\n\n\u201cIf we allow Democrats to continue this behavior, like, they\u2019re not going to get better,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to treat us better. They\u2019re not going to follow the rules more. So we\u2019ve got to take the gloves off and fight like they do.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe new conservative movement has to take on Trump\u2019s sense of boldness,\u201d he said.\n\nNow let\u2019s pick all of this apart.\n\nGaetz is certainly a standard-bearer for embracing Trump\u2019s \u201cboldness\u201d in the broader context that can include \u201cwillingness to say untrue things that advance your partisan goals.\u201d Trump\u2019s \u201cboldness\u201d often manifests as throwing punches at the opposition which, Gaetz correctly says at one point, is what much of the Republican base wants to see. But Trump\u2019s punches are often rooted in false or misleading information.\n\nAs are Gaetz\u2019s comments about the vote in Florida. He claims that Broward County added 80,000 ballots from nowhere between Election Day and the final vote count \u2014 a number that the Daytona Beach News-Journal interpreted as a reference to provisional ballots that are a common feature of Florida elections. (Asked about this on Fox News, Gaetz didn\u2019t clarify.) He claimed that \u201cmystery boxes\u201d of ballots had turned up, perhaps a reference to the discovery of a box labeled \u201cprovisional ballots\u201d at a school in Broward County \u2014 and which was found to contain no actual ballots. He claimed that Broward County had \u201cmore registered voters than she\u2019s got eligible registered voters,\u201d perhaps a reference to a prominent \u2014 and false \u2014 online meme alleging that more votes were cast in the county than there are voters. There weren\u2019t.\n\nGaetz claimed that, in Palm Beach County, illegal ballots had been mixed in with legal ballots and would be counted. That appears to be a mistaken reference to a decision made in Broward County to include some 200 provisional ballots in the total count despite the fact that at least 20 had been deemed ineligible. The signatures on the ballots didn\u2019t match signatures on file but were cast by registered voters, according to the Palm Beach Post.\n\nGaetz made another remarkable claim, too.\n\n\u201cLook,\u201d he said, \u201cthey already flipped an agriculture commissioner race. Right? I mean, the Republican won that Agriculture Commission race, and the Democrat is up now.\u201d\n\nThat Republican, state representative Matt Caldwell, didn\u2019t \u201cwin\u201d the race. It was called for him by some outlets, but, as more votes were counted, his Democratic opponent took the lead \u2014 as early as last Wednesday. Caldwell is suing Broward County in an effort to regain the lead, but at no point was it won in his favor.\n\nThis mirrors Trump\u2019s rhetoric, too. Whoever had the lead when the initial vote tally was done on Election Day is the winner, and any votes counted after that point, it seems, are somehow invalid or suspect. As the New York Times\u2019s David Leonhardt noted on Twitter, though, that only seems to be applicable in cases where the Republican led on the night of the election.\n\nIn Utah\u2019s 4th House district, the Democrat \u2014 Ben McAdams \u2014 led after the initial vote count. The Republican \u2014 Mia Love \u2014 has closed the gap since Election night. The outcome remains unclear.\n\n\n\nFunny, you don\u2019t hear much whining or conspiracy theorizing about that vote count. \u2014 David Leonhardt (@DLeonhardt) November 14, 2018\n\nUnmentioned by Gaetz: Why fraudsters would commit fraud, but not enough fraud to actually win the races.\n\nAlso unmentioned by Gaetz: There\u2019s been no evidence of actual fraud. There was an alleged issue with altered forms purportedly sent out by the Democratic Party, but beyond vague allegations, there\u2019s been nothing to suggest the vote in Florida was tainted in any significant way. Despite people looking.\n\nGaetz made the case to keep swinging away regardless.\n\n\u201cThe biggest threat to the Trump movement is that Republicans in office demoralize our base because the only way we win now is by driving turnout among our voters,\u201d Gaetz said. \u201cAnd if our voters just think we\u2019re weak, we don\u2019t fight, we don\u2019t do the things we say when we get elected? Then there is no future for us.\u201d\n\nHe appears to have taken that idea to heart.", "Brazil\u2019s President-elect Jair Bolsonaro attends a joint statement with Brazil\u2019s president, after a meeting at the Presidential Palace, in Brasilia, Brazil, Wednesday, Nov. 7, 2018.

He is anti-left and a self-proclaimed nationalist, and he campaigned for Bolsonaro, who was elected Oct.28.\n\n\u201cThe Brazilian foreign policy must be a part of the moment of recovery that Brazil lives today,\u201d the president-elect said about his appointee.\n\nAraujo has praised Trump\u2019s approach to foreign relations, saying the U.S. leader proposes a view of the West that is based on the recovery of its symbolic past. The Brazilian diplomat also believes globalism is an anti-Christian ideology.\n\nBolsonaro, a former army captain and longtime congressman, has on several occasions compared himself to Trump, although many analysts say his tough anti-crime and pro-gun positions resemble more those of Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte.\n\nSome diplomats were surprised with Araujo\u2019s appointment because he has never been in charge of an embassy during his 29-year diplomatic service.\n\nBolsonaro\u2019s aggressive rhetoric has already caused tensions with Egypt and Cuba, issues that Araujo will deal with once in office.\n\nThe Arab nation cancelled a trip of Brazilian lawmakers this year after the president-elect promised to move the Brazilian Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Bolsonaro later said the decision was not taken.\n\nCuba announced earlier Wednesday that it was ending a program that sent almost 9,000 medics to Brazil, acting after Bolsonaro said the program could continue only under new conditions. Among other things, he said the doctors must receive their salaries directly from Brazil and not through the Cuban government and be allowed to bring their families with them during their assignments.\n\nBolsonaro will also be starting his administration with some friction with China, which has invested billions of dollars in energy, infrastructure and oil projects in Brazil. During the campaign, he complained: \u201cThe Chinese are not buying in Brazil. They are buying Brazil itself.\u201d\n\nIn a recent editorial in the China Daily newspaper, the Chinese government warned Bolsonaro against aggressive statements aimed at China, saying they could cause troubles for Brazil.

Bezos tours the facility at the grand opening of the Amazon Spheres in Seattle in January. (Jason Redmond/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nAmazon\u2019s handling of its HQ2 decision reminds me of nothing so much as LeBron James\u2019s ill-fated television special, \u201cThe Decision.\u201d\n\nPerhaps you remember that 2010 episode, during which the greatest basketball player on the planet teamed up with ESPN and broadcaster Jim Gray to announce live his free-agency choice in front of not only millions watching at home but also a live studio audience made up of members of a Boys and Girls Club. Members who audibly gasped when James said he was abandoning him hometown team to join up with Dwyane Wade and Pat Riley of the Miami Heat \u2014 that he was \u201cgoing to take his talents to South Beach,\u201d as he infamously put it.\n\nIt didn\u2019t matter that the show raised money for charity or that there was legitimate public interest in his choice: The whole spectacle was grotesque, a celebration of a millionaire devastating an already-devastated town by announcing he was abandoning it to pursue his dreams elsewhere.\n\nAmazon\u2019s decision-making process with regard to the placement of its second headquarters has taken place in a similarly public way, with the online giant soliciting bids from cities across the country, narrowing down the list of potential winners as time progressed, and finally, in a shocking twist worthy of reality TV, choosing two sites rather than one. (Amazon\u2019s chief executive, Jeffrey P. Bezos, owns The Washington Post.)\n\nThe two chosen cities, it should be noted, are already considered winners in the global economy, two sites that need the influx of traffic and the increase in home prices less than anywhere outside of San Francisco, two sites filled with people ready to vent their annoyance about the imposition on their hometowns and the depletion of public coffers to bring jobs to their respective regions.\n\nThe promise of the HQ2 search all along had been the idea that Amazon might settle down in a city that hadn\u2019t quite kept pace with the Acela Corridor and Silicon Valley during our latest e-boom. Columbus, Indianapolis, Nashville, Dallas, even Newark or Denver: These were cities that could have used an influx of high-paying jobs. The idea was bold and grand, a promise to spread the wealth in a country staring down increases in inequality tied as much to geography as anything else.\n\nThe promise went unfulfilled, of course, and the decision to split the headquarters in twain \u2014 with both halves going to the haves rather than one going to a have and another a have-not \u2014 was, simply, a PR disaster. Someone somewhere overestimated how much the public would enjoy seeing a megacorporation extract financial concessions from localities in an effort to boost the bottom line, all while dashing the hopes of smaller cities that never truly stood a chance at landing the offices.\n\nNo blunder lasts forever, of course. Following the debacle that was \u201cThe Decision,\u201d James redoubled his charitable efforts. The LeBron James Family Foundation has positively intervened in the lives of hundreds of students. In 2015, James teamed up with the University of Akron to start a program that would pay for four-year rides for as many as 2,300 students, a financial commitment that could clock in at nine figures. James also ended up returning to Cleveland, delivering a championship to the city that had been title-less for more than half a century before the Cavaliers managed to win a title in 2016. Winning covers up for many mistakes.\n\nSimilarly, people will forget about Amazon\u2019s missteps here. It\u2019s hard to hold a grudge when the prices are so good, the shipping is so quick, and the shopping is so convenient. But the corporation could learn a lesson or two from James\u2019s good works: Perhaps Whole Foods stores in finalist cities that weren\u2019t chosen could double as food banks for the needy, or opportunity centers could be established to retrain workers struggling to survive in a rapidly changing economy.\n\nOr maybe Amazon could use its lobbying powers to ensure that nothing like HQ2 ever happens again: There\u2019s a growing consensus on the left and right alike that such corporate handouts are little more than cronyism designed to turn our cities against each other in a fight for business scraps. While lobbying in favor of a federal law designed to ban such practices would undoubtedly come in for criticism as self-serving \u2014 Amazon got theirs, now they want to stop everyone else from benefiting \u2014 it would equally undoubtedly be a massive public good. Imagine how much goodwill the company could generate by championing legislation that would end sports teams holding cities hostage for new stadiums, laws that would stop corporate behemoths from extracting billions in concessions from struggling local economies.\n\nLike \u201cThe Decision,\u201d the HQ2 mess will leave a bad taste in the public\u2019s collective mouth for some time. How long that aftertaste remains is entirely up to the retailer.", "\n\nZoe Kazan plays a pioneer woman, Alice Longabaugh, in \u201cThe Ballad of Buster Scruggs.\u201d (Netflix/Netflix)\n\nReporter\n\nRating:\n\nIn the Coen brothers\u2019 brilliant new film \u201cThe Ballad of Buster Scruggs,\u201d an existential western told in six unrelated chapters, the cowboy cliches pile up quickly, like the film\u2019s body count. A gunslinger, a bank robber, a prospector, a trapper, a gal in search of a good man all commingle with so many other saddle-worn tropes of the oater genre \u2014 the hangin\u2019 tree, the saloon, the wagon train, the stagecoach and the ubiquitous, \u201cWestworld\u201d-style town that populates our collective imagination of the American West \u2014 that the film at first feels like a cartoon.\n\nIn fact, its first chapter, the shortest of the film\u2019s half-dozen vignettes, and the one that lends \u201cBallad\u201d its title, is a kind of cowboy comic book. Starring Tim Blake Nelson as the titular Buster, a traveling singer and gunslinger who dispatches those who cross him in spectacularly exaggerated style, this short take on the genre is both funny and morbid as heck, signaling the Coens\u2019 intention to chew on the theme of human mortality like a cowpoke nurses his chawin\u2019 tobacky.\n\nThat single-minded focus continues in the next installment, in which James Franco plays a bank robber who has been sentenced to death by hanging. Depending on how you look at things, he\u2019s either the luckiest or unluckiest man in the world, as his execution goes (darkly) comically awry.\n\nBut by the time Chapter Two has gotten underway, it\u2019s clear that the Coens\u2019 aim is something more than laughter.\n\n\n\nGrainger Hines as the Sam Elliottesque Mr. Arthur.

It is here, in this O.

(Evan Vucci/AP)\n\nOpinion writer\n\nIf President Trump has one signature issue, it\u2019s immigration. Or, more specifically, the fear of immigrants. While previous presidents from both parties have, at times, struggled to arrive at the best immigration policy, to one degree or another they all acknowledged that the immigrant story is the American story \u2014 one of risk-taking, struggle, work, hope and creating a better life for the next generation. Trump, however, sees immigrants only as a source of crime, economic threats and cultural displacement. And, critically, this is both what he sincerely believes and what he thinks is the most effective political tool available to him.\n\nSo it was no surprise that, as the midterm elections approached, he would attempt to make them about immigration and the threat it supposedly poses. Now that the final votes are being tallied, it is becoming clear that not only did he fail, he made his party\u2019s situation far worse than it might have been. His strategy backfired.\n\nMost obviously, Trump\u2019s campaigning on immigration didn\u2019t stop Democrats from taking back control of the House, flipping seven governorships from Republican to Democrat, taking control of state legislatures, and passing progressive initiatives on issues such as Medicaid expansion, voting rights and the minimum wage. In Congress, where Trump focused most of his attention, Democrats faced a brutal map in the Senate but lost a net of only two seats (one, if Sen. Bill Nelson pulls ahead in a Florida recount). In the House, it looks as though they\u2019ll pick up 38 seats, their biggest gain since the post-Watergate election in 1974.\n\nIf that were all we knew, Trump might be able to argue that focusing on immigration was still a good tactic and, without it, things could have been even worse for Republicans. But that doesn\u2019t appear to be the case. Instead, his relentless fearmongering seems to have produced a backlash.\n\nTake, for instance, this poll conducted for the progressive group Immigration Hub:\n\nAccording to Nick Gourevitch, Partner at Global Strategy Group, \u201cNew polling we conducted in the immediate aftermath of the election shows that Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant focus backfired with voters in Pennsylvania and Colorado. Voters found that Republican candidate alignment with Trump on immigration was more of a reason to vote against those candidates than to vote for them, including with politically important groups like Independents in Colorado and voters in Pennsylvania who voted for Trump in 2016 and shifted to Bob Casey in 2018.\u201d\n\nEvery race is different, of course, but we saw in many districts and states that Republican candidates either embraced Trump\u2019s xenophobic arguments and lost, or awkwardly tried to distance themselves from the president. Meanwhile, they got hammered on the party\u2019s efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and remove protections for people with preexisting conditions \u2014 a threat that voters obviously saw as far more urgent than a bunch of families trudging across Mexico to request asylum. Some Republicans were warning before Election Day that Trump\u2019s demagoguery would cost them seats; they turned out to be right.\n\nThis failure happened despite the fact that Trump got exactly what he wanted from the news media. When he began saying that we were under dire threat from an \u201cinvasion\u201d of migrants walking toward the United States, despite the fact that their caravan was 1,000 miles away from the border, the news media immediately pushed the issue as though it were an immediate crisis. It was all-caravan-all-the-time on Fox News leading up to Election Day, but other networks focused on it as well, as did newspapers, repeatedly running stories about the caravan on their front pages.\n\nMany critics are now describing this as an abysmal failure of the media, particularly now that everyone has simply stopped talking about the caravan, as we knew they would once the election was over. It is a difficult question: How much do you allow the president to determine your coverage? After all, he\u2019s the president, and what he does is inherently newsworthy. They don\u2019t call it the bully pulpit for nothing. But if you simply repeat everything he says, you\u2019ve become a tool of his propaganda. This problem is far more acute when the president is a lying demagogue, so the answer most new organizations arrive at is that we\u2019ll cover the issue, but we\u2019ll do it with enough thoroughness and skepticism to counter whatever dishonesty with which it\u2019s being served up.\n\nThe trouble with that, however, is that there are times when even the most skeptical coverage can still serve the demagogue\u2019s goals. Just having stories and photos of the caravan on the front page every day could well have been all the president wanted, even if in the text of the story one could read about how it was actually weeks away, smaller than Trump claimed, and not actually full of gang members and terrorists. Half the battle in public debate is determining what gets defined as a problem that requires action to address, even if you still have to convince everyone that your solution is the better one.\n\nBut if you think the media failed in its handling of the issue, it\u2019s even more notable that, despite getting the coverage he wanted, Trump got the result he didn\u2019t. His voters didn\u2019t flock to the polls in numbers sufficient to beat back the blue wave. Suburban voters, likely turned off by him, handed Democrats one victory after another.\n\nThere are many reasons the immigration issue didn\u2019t work to Trump\u2019s advantage this year the way it did in 2016. But we\u2019ll get another test in 2020. When he runs for reelection, Trump will try once again to use hate and fear of immigrants to pull himself to victory. We can say that with confidence because, despite his party\u2019s midterm losses, there\u2019s no reason to think he has changed his views about what his base wants and what works for him \u2014 not to mention what he truly believes is best for the country.\n\nIf Trump has any bit of political genius, it\u2019s his ability to locate the worst in people \u2014 their fear, their envy, their resentments, their hatred \u2014 and stimulate it with a poisonous kind of adrenaline. This time, though, most voters recoiled in disgust at what he was doing. We\u2019ll see whether it happens again in two years.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe White House is in meltdown\n\nDan Crenshaw: SNL mocked my appearance. Here\u2019s why I didn\u2019t demand an apology.\n\nA frightful portrait of a president out of control\n\nRepublicans find themselves back with the same problem they had before Trump\n\nSign up to get the latest from Opinions in your inbox six days a week", "Every year, as the snows thaw and the sea ice recedes, a desolate Alaska coastline awakens \u2014 and for a short but dramatic period of time, renews its relentless collapse into the sea.\n\nExcept now, the stretch of Alaskan shoreline is eroding more than twice as fast as it used to, fueled by Earth\u2019s warming temperatures.\n\nA new satellite-based study of the retreating permafrost coastline at Drew Point, in Alaska\u2019s North Slope region, shows that from 1955 to 1979, the rate of loss was only about 23 feet per year. From 2007 through 2016, it was about 56 feet per year.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve basically been watching that coastline erode and collapse for a little more than a decade now,\u201d said Benjamin Jones of the University of Alaska at Fairbanks, who has been studying the Drew Point site since 2007. Jones is lead author of a new study, aided by 25 colleagues from a host of institutions in the United States and Germany, documenting a decade\u2019s worth of changes at this site located between Utqia\u0121vik (previously Barrow), the northernmost U.S. city, and Prudhoe Bay.\n\nThe study at Drew Point, where shallow waters offshore are fronted by 16-foot bluffs, is showing especially fast rates of erosion and may hint that much of the coastline encircling the Arctic could be undergoing similar, if not quite as rapid, changes \u2014 even if they are unknown and unrecorded.\n\nJones provided The Washington Post with daily camera images showing a typical spring-to-summer progression at the site, from late April through early September of this year. In the images, you can watch as the landscape thaws, the sea ice clears, and then the bluffs start collapsing into the sea \u2014 in this case, dragging along with them a data logger and buoy that the scientists had installed to take readings.\n\n\u201cThat small buoy, when it did fall into the ocean, it was able to maintain float, and I was able to retrieve it,\u201d Jones said.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first such time-lapse video taken at Drew Point, a site that makes such a presentation almost irresistible \u2014 but it comes as the new research affirmed a speedup of losses over the past decade.\n\nJones and his colleagues, in their new study in Environmental Research Letters, calculate that the coast, on average, is retreating inland by 56 feet per year, or just less than 20 yards. That\u2019s 2.5 times the prior measured rates.\n\nIn the most extreme year, 2016, the coast retreated by an average of 72 feet. Most strikingly, all of this is occurring during a relatively narrow window of roughly 90 days, or the open-water season, when the coast is beset by waves. The length of the open-water season has also doubled in recent decades.\n\nCalculating the consequences over a 5\u00bd-mile stretch of coastline, Jones said means that about 30 football fields are being lost annually and that about 300 were lost in total between 2007 and 2016.\n\nFew other stretches of Arctic coastline are being watched in the same way. Jones estimates that only 1 to 2 percent of Arctic coastlines have been surveyed to study how much they are eroding, and few to the extent that Drew Point has been.\n\nYet vulnerable permafrost \u2014 the reason for what\u2019s happening at Drew Point \u2014 is present across the Arctic.\n\nThe bluffs at Drew Point are composed of a mixture of frozen soil and thick wedges of ice. They are very sensitive to temperature \u2014 and both the air and the sea alike in this location have been getting warmer.\n\nPerhaps more important, though, is that with the retreat of Arctic sea ice, the period of open water offshore, when waves can break free from winter ice, is getting longer. This allows waves to slam into the coast, the most immediate trigger of the loss of land.\n\n\u201cBringing the level of the sea up to the base of the bluff eats away at the base of the ice-rich permafrost, eroding it both thermally and mechanically,\u201d Jones said.\n\nNobody lives at Drew Point, but the loss of sea ice, and the resulting increase in waves, has been a threat to a number of Arctic communities. That includes tiny Kivalina, on the coast of the Chukchi Sea, which is seeking to relocate because waves threaten the barrier island where the community sits.\n\nThe Drew Point site presents an interesting contrast with another place in the United States that is also losing land rapidly \u2014 but for very different reasons. That\u2019s the Louisiana Gulf Coast, where wetland loss rates of late have amounted to a football field every 100 minutes.\n\nBut there are massive differences, notes Torbjorn Tornqvist, a coastal geologist at Tulane University who studies the region.\n\nThe Louisiana coast has been studied for more than half a century, Tornqvist explained, and the causes of change include sea-level rise, land subsidence, dams and other obstructions that sap sediment from the Mississippi River, destruction of wetlands for canals, oil and gas projects, and more.\n\nIn contrast, much of the Alaska coastline has no infrastructure, and rising seas are not really the big issue \u2014 it\u2019s all about warming and the retreat of ice, followed by the punishing waves.\n\n\u201cA system like this is potentially even more sensitive to climate change, compared to lower-latitude coasts like Louisiana,\u201d Tornqvist said. \u201cIt strikes me that just temperature change alone can be a huge factor here due to the destabilizing effect of thawing permafrost. Put differently, even without sea-level rise, coastlines like these might exhibit accelerated rates of retreat.\u201d", "Movie critic\n\nRating:\n\n\u201cThe Front Runner\u201d chronicles 21 tumultuous days in 1987 when the worlds of politics, journalism and entertainment tilted on their respective axes, a seismic shift in priorities and protocol that converged on one man. Gary Hart, a former U.S. senator from Colorado, who had narrowly missed running for president in 1984, was preparing another campaign in the spring of 1987, this time with the wind at his back and the polls in his favor.\n\nAs a title card says at the beginning of this perceptive, carefully calibrated drama, a lot can happen in three weeks. Adapted by Jason Reitman from Matt Bai\u2019s book \u201cAll the Truth Is Out,\u201d \u201cThe Front Runner\u201d plunges viewers headlong into the bewildering jumble of entitlement, idealism, unintended consequences and still-unresolved issues that transformed Hart from a high-minded statesman to tabloid roadkill with dizzying speed.\n\nThis is a movie that intends to raise far more troubling questions than it answers, encouraging the audience to emerge from the story, not with a reassuring sense of certainty but rather the disquieting notion that even solid moral reasoning can incur a grievous cost. Most confoundingly, it sheds no light on Hart himself: a man who steadfastly insisted on maintaining his privacy, whose impressive intellect was couched within an aloof, withholding persona, remains a cipher, the missing core of a movie that\u2019s nominally about him, but can\u2019t seem to get a bead on its own protagonist.\n\n[Here are the 12 movies you should see this holiday season]\n\nThat makes \u201cThe Front Runner\u201d less of an emotional than a mental exercise, albeit an engaging and provocative one. Adopting a style reminiscent of Robert Altman, as well as Michael Ritchie\u2019s \u201cThe Candidate,\u201d Reitman has designed his movie to be an intensely subjective swirl of voices, points of view and densely layered perspectives. Reitman isn\u2019t as interested in Hart \u2014 played in an awkward, subdued performance by Hugh Jackman \u2014 as the vortex of activity around him: the cadre of young advisers and volunteers marshaled by campaign manager Bill Dixon (J.K. Simmons), the gaggle of reporters Hart leads to Red Rocks to announce his \u201ccampaign of ideas,\u201d the serene cabin in Troublesome Gulch where he lives with his wife, Lee (Vera Farmiga), and their kids.\n\nIt\u2019s not as if the marriage has always been ideal: The Harts have been separated before, and when the candidate makes a last-minute decision to cancel a trip to the Kentucky Derby to join a swampy Southern fixer named Billy Broadhurst for some R & R in Florida, no alarm bells go off. But when reporters at the Miami Herald receive a tip that Hart embarked on an affair on a trip to Bimini, then stake out the candidate\u2019s Washington townhouse for proof, a high-speed disaster ensues. Hart \u2014 equal parts arrogant and naive \u2014 tries to brazen it out thinking that the old rules will apply. Meanwhile, a new form of TV infotainment feasts on a telegenic scandal, white-shoe newspapers find themselves playing catch-up in unsavory games of innuendo, the Hart campaign implodes and the name Donna Rice becomes inextricably tied to her era\u2019s biggest \u201czipper story.\u201d\n\n[Politician\u2019s sex lives used to be off limits. One scandal changed everything.]\n\n\n\nHugh Jackman stars as Gary Hart in \u201cThe Front Runner.\u201d (Sony Pictures Entertainment)\n\nReitman visits each of these strands of the story in a breathless relay, one minute eavesdropping on Hart\u2019s press corps as they weigh whether to pursue the womanizing rumors, then following the fictionalized Washington Post reporter A.J. Parker (Mamoudou Athie) back to meet with his editors to debate whether such salacious gossip is worthy of the paper that broke Watergate. Back in Colorado, a young campaign aide named Joe Trippi (Oliver Cooper) tries to help Lee and the Harts\u2019 daughter fend off the camera crews camped in their front yard, while a female counterpart in Washington, played in a sympathetic performance by Molly Ephraim, is assigned to \u201cmanage\u201d Rice, who despite her intelligence has been reduced to being a bimbo quickly discarded by Hart and his handlers.\n\nPlayed by Sara Paxton through dramatic cascades of mascara tears, Rice emerges as a smart, capable, genuinely wounded party in \u201cThe Front Runner,\u201d which clearly sees her as the victim of both a ruthless male-centric campaign and a hypocritical media culture that has since metastasized to grotesque levels. (Reitman is particularly adroit in staging the moment when Hart meets Rice on the fatally named boat, Monkey Business: We don\u2019t hear what is said; the camera simply observes as Hart\u2019s face lights up while deafening music plays, then cuts to a long shot of the boat bobbing quietly on the water, reinforcing the episode\u2019s essential unknowability.)\n\nTrue to its multifaceted form, \u201cThe Front Runner\u201d is careful to give everyone, especially women, their say about male politicians being held accountable after decades of good-ol\u2019-boy courtesy and cozying up. But Reitman and Bai leave plenty of room for doubt, including the infamous back door through which Hart insisted Rice leave on the night the Herald spied on him. Although \u201cThe Front Runner\u201d was finished long before recent accusations came to light that Broadhurst set Hart up with Rice at the behest of George H.W. Bush campaign consultant Lee Atwater, the openwork of the narrative easily accommodates that possibility.\n\nMost profoundly, the filmmakers put Hart\u2019s story squarely in the context of the present, when the norms and traditions that were evolving in 1987 now seem like the quaint artifacts of an era supplanted by a vicious double helix of personal destruction and shamelessness. At one point, Hart bitterly predicted that if media and politics continued apace, the American people would eventually get the leaders we deserve. One can conclude many things from \u201cThe Front Runner\u201d: that Hart was his own worst enemy, that he was haughty and hubristic and fatally out of touch with the times. But, at least in that particular instance of foresight, it\u2019s impossible to say he was wrong.", "\n\nA drunk raccoon in Milton, W.Va. (Milton Police Department)\n\nRabid animals are, of course, no laughing matter. The rabies virus can infect the central nervous system, resulting in disease and death, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But that happens after a host of increasingly scary symptoms: partial paralysis, agitation, hallucinations, hydrophobia. A British man and two children died in Morocco after they were bitten by a rabid cat.\n\nSo it was not surprising that when people in the city of Milton, W.Va., saw raccoons behaving weirdly, they involved the local police.\n\nOfficers staked out the area where the suspect animals were hanging out, looking for any signs of the masked perpetrators.\n\nBut when they caught two of them, they realized they were dealing with a different kind of issue.\n\nThe raccoons weren\u2019t rabid. They were drunk.\n\nThe raccoons, apparently, had been feasting on crab apples that had fermented on the tree, causing the small animals to walk around \u201cstaggering and disoriented,\u201d police said.\n\n\u201cTurns out they appear to be drunk on crab apples,\u201d police said in their official statement to the community.\n\nThe apprehended animals were held in custody and allowed to sober up in what can only be deemed a raccoon drunk tank.\n\nThen they were released into the wild, but not before some enterprising officer took a picture of the animal, showing it to be dazed, woozy, more than a little out of it.

Posted by Milton Police Department on Monday, November 12, 2018\n\nAnd with that, Dallas joined a long line of animals that have made headlines for public intoxication.\n\nOfficers in Gilbert, Minn., for example, received reports of under-the-influence birds \u201cflying into windows, cars and acting confused,\u201d Police Chief Ty Techar wrote. An early frost meant that berries had fermented before the birds flew south for the winter, according to The Washington Post\u2019s Antonia Noori Farzan, and birds were eating them and getting drunk.\n\nBut all birds weren\u2019t equally affected, the chief wrote: \u201cIt appears that some birds are getting a little more \u2018tipsy\u2019 than normal,\u201d he wrote. \u201cGenerally, younger birds\u2019 livers cannot handle the toxins as efficiently as more mature birds.\u201d\n\nResidents who thought that perhaps they were in a 21st-century remake of an Alfred Hitchcock film were amused but also relieved:\n\n\u201cThis explains why I have hit 7 birds with my car this week,\u201d one person commented on the chief\u2019s post.\n\n[Scientists have identified the 50-foot creature that washed up on an Indonesian beach]\n\nAnd in Wayne Township, Ind., in the spring, a frantic woman walked into a fire station and told firefighters that her pet raccoon was \u201clethargic\u201d and possibly severely stoned after getting into someone else\u2019s pot, according to The Washington Post\u2019s Karin Brulliard.\n\nHigh animals are more common as more jurisdictions legalize marijuana and people plop the drug into tasty edibles that also appeal to their pets, who can\u2019t read warning labels and don\u2019t typically have the impulse control to stop at one, Brulliard reported.\n\nAlthough most of the calls involve dogs chomping on marijuana edibles, Brulliard wrote, \u201cveterinarians also cited examples of chihuahuas lapping up bong water, cats being exposed to vaping, and even rabbits, ferrets and birds getting accidentally stoned.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nHe was on his way to meet the mayor.

The end of the \u201cMas Medicos,\u201d or \u201cMore Doctors,\u201d program signals a sharp deterioration in relations between communist Cuba and Brazil, which just elected far-right presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro. (Eraldo Peres, File/Associated Press)\n\nHAVANA \u2014 Cuba said Wednesday that it is ending a program that sent thousands of government doctors to underserved regions of Brazil in exchange for hundreds of millions in badly needed hard currency.\n\nThe end of the \u201cMas Medicos,\u201d or \u201cMore Doctors,\u201d program signals a sharp deterioration in relations between communist Cuba and Brazil, which just elected far-right presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro. He takes office Jan. 1.\n\nCuba made the announcement after Bolsonaro said the program overseen by the World Health Organization could only continue if doctors directly received their salaries from Brazil, and were able to bring their families with them during their assignments, among other conditions.\n\nThe Cuban government generally keeps most of the salaries of state employees working abroad as part of the socialist state\u2019s \u201cinternational missions.\u201d Participants also are generally barred from bringing family members in a measure that critics say is designed to prevent doctors from emigrating.\n\n\u201cMas Medicos\u201d started five years ago under leftist President Dilma Rousseff. Cuba said roughly 20,000 doctors saw millions of patients in areas such as the Amazon rainforest and slums of major cities.\n\nCuba maintains similar missions in 67 other countries but \u201cMas Medicos\u201d was one of the largest and most important, serving as a link between the cash-strapped island and South America\u2019s largest economy.\n\n\u201cCubans have provided a valuable service to the Brazilian people with dignity, deep sensitivity, professionality, dedication and altruism,\u201d Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel wrote on Twitter. \u201cSuch humane acts should be respected and defended.\u201d\n\nAll Cuban doctors work for the state and virtually all receive salaries that are well below $100 a month. Doctors are not permitted to leave Cuba without government permission, a control that was lifted for virtually all other Cubans five years ago.\n\nThousands of Cuban doctors work in the island\u2019s public health-care system, which suffers from crumbling infrastructure but still provides free and universal health care to all citizens. Thousands of other Cuban doctors go abroad each year and generate billions of dollars for the state, one of Cuba\u2019s most important sources of foreign exchange.\n\nThe doctors generally receive a fraction of the salary paid to the Cuban government. But even that fraction far exceeds the salaries of doctors working in Cuba. That drives many doctors to complete foreign missions in order to earn cash for important expenses like home repairs, appliances or a motor vehicle.\n\nThe Brazilian Ministry of Health said there were 8,332 Cuban doctors in Brazil, each costing the country roughly $3,100 a month, plus room and board.\n\nBolsonaro said Brazil would offer asylum to Cuban doctors who wished to stay in Brazil.\n\n\u201cThis is slave labor,\u201d he said. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t be accomplices.\u201d\n\nNeither side said exactly when the Cuban doctors would be leaving but their departure comes at a bad time for Cuba, which is facing its third year of slow growth, expected to be around 1 percent this year. Productivity is low in virtually every state-run industry, tourism has slowed under the Trump administration and Venezuela, a key ally, has cut back on subsidized oil and other aid.\n\nNonetheless, Bolsonaro\u2019s conditions were out of the question for Cuba.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not acceptable to question the dignity, professionalism and altruism of Cubans who, with the support of their families, provide services in 67 countries,\u201d the Cuban health ministry said in a statement. \u201cThe Brazilian people will understand who bears the responsibility for the fact that our doctors can\u2019t keep providing their support and solidarity in that nation.\u201d\n\n_______\n\nDe Sousa reported from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.", "Arizona Republican Sen. Jeff Flake said Wednesday that he would not vote for any more of President Trump\u2019s judicial nominees until the Senate votes on a bill to prevent special counsel Robert S. Mueller III from being fired \u2014 a pledge that could complicate Republicans\u2019 hope to confirm dozens of conservative judges before the end of the year.\n\nFlake\u2019s warning will likely force Republicans \u2014 who hold 51 seats in the Senate \u2014 to rely on Vice President Pence to confirm any of the 32 judicial nominees pending before the full Senate, as Democrats have little incentive to support those who Flake has committed to oppose. It also means that Republicans will likely have to go around the Senate Judiciary Committee, where Flake is a member and the GOP has only a one-seat majority, to advance any of the 21 nominees waiting for that panel\u2019s endorsement. That also will require Pence\u2019s tie-breaking vote.\n\nFlake issued his threat after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) blocked Flake and Sen. Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.) from holding a vote on the bill, which would give any fired special counsel the ability to swiftly challenge their termination before a panel of three federal judges. Most Republicans \u2014 including co-authors Sens. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) and Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) \u2014 have argued that the bill is unnecessary because Trump would never dare fire Mueller, whose ongoing probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election has sought to learn whether anyone in Trump\u2019s campaign conspired with those efforts.\n\nFlake challenged that rationale, given Trump\u2019s recent decision to appoint Matthew G. Whitaker as acting attorney general and give him oversight of the Mueller probe.\n\nWhitaker has made past statements that are critical of the investigation. Flake said he believes Whitaker should recuse himself from the Russia probe, letting deputy attorney general Rod J. Rosenstein reassume authority over it.\n\n\u201cThe president now has this investigation in his sights and we all know it,\u201d Flake said on the Senate floor Wednesday, emphatically asking his colleagues why they were content to allow a potential constitutional crisis to unfold.\n\n\u201cWhy? Why do we do this? To protect a man seemingly who is so incurious about what Russia did during the 2016 elections?\u201d Flake said, referring to Trump. \u201cWhy do we do that? Do we have no more institutional pride here?\u201d\n\nFlake, who is retiring at the end of the year, has become one of Trump\u2019s most vocal Republican critics in Congress. His pledge to vote against Trump\u2019s judicial nominees unless the special counsel bill is voted on is the most concrete step he has yet taken to try to deny Trump something tangible, instead of just decry his actions on the Senate floor.\n\n\u201cYou use what leverage you have,\u201d Flake told reporters, explaining why he made his threat. \u201cThis is a priority now.\u201d\n\n[Justice Dept. releases legal memo defending Whitaker\u2019s appointment as acting attorney general]\n\nBy himself, Flake cannot completely foul up GOP leaders\u2019 plans to confirm more conservative judges this year. But he and Coons said they hope to convince other Republicans to join their effort. If one more Republican does, they and the Democrats would be able to prevent Trump from getting any additional judicial nominees confirmed in 2018 \u2014 a move that Flake guessed would at least send a strong message about the importance of the special counsel bill.\n\n\u201cWe are confident [the bill] would get 60 votes if given a vote,\u201d Coons told reporters. \u201cIt is time for us to move from speech to action.\u201d\n\nOne senator that Coons and Flake may target in the days ahead is Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine). Last week, she said that she thought the Senate should vote on the bill.\n\n\u201cSenate debate and passage of this bill would send a powerful message that Mr. Mueller must be able to complete his work unimpeded,\u201d Collins said in a statement, in which she also said she was \u201cconcerned\u201d about Whitaker\u2019s views on Mueller\u2019s probe.\n\nEven if senators succeed in passing the bill, its fate in the House is uncertain. Though House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) has defended Mueller\u2019s right to conduct his probe unimpeded, he has also determined that a bill to protect him is not necessary. Still more Republicans have charged that the legislation is unconstitutional, as it allows the courts to review the president\u2019s hiring and firing decisions, which are considered his purview.\n\nGiven those circumstances, the best chance of passing the bill this year is if senators manage to convince leaders to include it in must-pass legislation, such as the spending bill lawmakers need to approve early next month.\n\nIn the meantime, it is unclear whether Whitaker will indulge his previously stated desire to constrain Mueller\u2019s probe, or permit it to continue unrestricted.\n\nThis week, the state of Maryland filed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of Whitaker\u2019s appointment. Some legal experts have suggested that Whitaker, who was former attorney general Jeff Sessions\u2019s chief of staff, is ineligible for the top Justice Department job, even on an acting basis, because he was not confirmed by the Senate.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, the Justice Department issued a memo defending the legality of Whitaker\u2019s appointment.\n\nThis is not the first time Flake has broken from his party to team up with Coons. Last month, the duo joined forces to push the Senate to demand an FBI investigation into sexual assault allegations made against Brett M. Kavanaugh before voting on his nomination to the Supreme Court. In that instance, they succeeded.\n\nDevlin Barrett contributed to this report.", "\"I haven't got the foggiest idea\" @ChrisMasonBBC beautifully sums up the complexities of #Brexit. \ud83e\udd2f pic.twitter.com/JJJ4E24VFx \u2014 BBC Breakfast (@BBCBreakfast) November 12, 2018\n\nMorning swept across the globe Monday, and as reliable as the sunrise itself, out came all the talking heads with all their predictions on all the world\u2019s problems.\n\n\u201cThe odds favor Rick Scott going to the U.S. Senate and Ron DeSantis being the next governor,\u201d reporter Steve Bousquet told CNN from Tallahassee.\n\n\u201cChina would win a trade war versus the U.S.,\" investment expert Thanos Papasavvas confidently told Bloomberg.

(Michael Robinson Chavez/The Washington Post)\n\nMedia critic\n\nThe Capital, a Maryland community newspaper where five employees were killed in June in a mass shooting, is pushing to unionize under the auspices of the Washington-Baltimore News Guild. The initiative, say staffers, is driven by low pay and a sense of alienation that comes with working as part of such a large corporation; the newspaper is a unit of the Baltimore Sun Media Group, which is in turn part of Tribune Publishing.\n\n\u201cWashington-Baltimore News Guild will request voluntary recognition sometime this afternoon from Tribune,\u201d says Bruce Jett, the organizing consultant for the News Guild.\n\nThe Capital\u2019s unionization effort is part of a bigger campaign spanning three newsrooms and including the following titles: the Capital (Annapolis and Anne Arundel County); the Towson Times; the Catonsville Times; the Carroll County Times; the Aegis (Harford County); the Howard County Times; the Bowie-Blade News; the Crofton-West County Gazette; and the Maryland Gazette. According to Capital reporter Phil Davis, there are roughly 50 employees who would be represented by the Chesapeake News Guild. Thirty-six of them have stated their support to form a union, according to organizers. In September, the company voluntarily recognized the Tidewater Media Guild union, representing employees at the Virginian-Pilot and Daily Press.\n\nDanielle Ohl, a Capital reporter covering the city of Annapolis as well as the Naval Academy, says journalists are seeking a pipeline to people who make the decisions. \u201cThe issue is not necessarily working for The Capital. We all love the work we do. We all love our direct editors. \u2026 The issue is that sometimes they just don\u2019t have a say in what happens to us.\u201d A year ago, Ohl started at the Capital with a salary of $33,000 per year.\n\nUnion-organizing activity at the newspapers predated by several months the horrific June 28 attack allegedly committed by Jarrod Ramos, an area man who held a grudge against the Capital. Four journalists \u2014 Rob Hiaasen, 59; Wendi Winters, 65; Gerald Fischman, 61; and John McNamara, 56 \u2014 and sales assistant Rebecca Smith, 34, died in the attack. When the gunman burst into the newspaper\u2019s Annapolis offices, Davis was in the newsroom and sought cover under a desk. He tweeted from the scene and later told the Baltimore Sun: \u201cI\u2019m a police reporter. I write about this stuff \u2014 not necessarily to this extent, but shootings and death \u2014 all the time. But as much as I\u2019m going to try to articulate how traumatizing it is to be hiding under your desk, you don\u2019t know until you\u2019re there and you feel helpless.\u201d\n\nThe journalism world rallied around the survivors and the families of the fallen. The Michael and Jackie Ferro Foundation \u2014 named in part after the former chairman of Tronc, the ill-advised and short-lived alt-name of Tribune Publishing \u2014 contributed $1 million to the Capital Gazette Families Fund. Ohl credits the company\u2019s brass for their compassion and leadership.\n\nThough the trauma delayed the surviving staffers\u2019 union drive, it didn\u2019t change the workplace fundamentals. \u201cWhat you saw after the shooting was that no one wanted it to stop,\u201d says Davis, referring to the union drive. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like we\u2019d wake up the next day and they would be paying us more money,\u201d he continues, acknowledging that that\u2019s a \u201cmorbid way of putting it.\u201d\n\nMorbid, yet accurate. Davis earns $35,000, in a major metropolitan area with high housing costs, and can\u2019t be sure when or if a raise is in the pipeline. There are no step increases in the current system, just merit and seniority raises, he says. Salaries as high as $40,000 are rare at the newspaper, says the 23-year-old Ohl, noting that it\u2019s not uncommon for someone to have put in 15 to 20 years while still drawing pay in the $30,000 ballpark. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d she says.\n\nAnother concern is hierarchy. Directives from Tribune Publishing, say employees, routinely come in for emergency landings on the desks of the community reporters. Just last week, for instance, the Virginian-Pilot reported that Tribune Publishing would be offering buyouts to certain non-union employees. The rationale for the move stunned staffers at the Capital: \u201cDuring its third-quarter conference call, the company said it recorded a net loss of $4.2 million in the three months ending Sept. 30, all of it attributable to newsprint tariff costs that have since been rescinded and costs following the June 28 fatal shooting of five members of the company\u2019s The Capital newsroom in Annapolis,\u201d reported the Virginian-Pilot. A press release on the company\u2019s financials contained this line: \u201cAdjusted EBITDA for third quarter 2018 was $16.6 million, versus $20.1 million in the third quarter 2017. The decline is primarily due to higher newsprint pricing related to the recently rescinded tariffs, as well as the financial impact from the Capital Gazette tragedy.\u201d Justin Dearborn, the company\u2019s chairman and chief executive, is quoted in the release saying, \u201cDespite the industry headwinds and the after-effects of the Capital Gazette tragedy, we performed well in the quarter and continue to establish the infrastructure for long-term success.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo a lot of people, the Tribune was saying, \u2018Oh, we had this unavoidable tragedy, so we couldn\u2019t make any money,'\u201d says Cody Boteler, 23, a reporter for the Catonsville Times and the Arbutus Times. Says Ohl: \u201cIt was very emotional for us, finding that out and reading that report.\u201d\n\nAccording to Libby Solomon, a 24-year-old reporter at the Towson Times, she and her colleagues on the community beat tend to be under 26, so they can get health insurance under their parents\u2019 plans. There are four news reporter positions in Solomon\u2019s newsroom, and she has seen those positions turn over seven times in less than two years. \u201cI don\u2019t think that the communities we cover deserve to be a stop on the road to better things,\u201d says Solomon.\n\nWhen community reporters come on board at the company, says Solomon, there\u2019s an \u201cimplication\u201d that the post may be a \u201cstepping stone\u201d to bigger things, considering that Tribune Publishing houses titles such as the Baltimore Sun, the New York Daily News, the Chicago Tribune and others. Yet mentorships don\u2019t happen, say employees. The company has an unwritten rule barring significant professional consultation between community news reporters and Baltimore Sun editorial types. \u201cThere have been people who have said, \u2018I want to be mentored by someone,\u2019 and they\u2019ve said no,\u201d says Solomon.\n\nA possible rationale for the barrier: The Washington-Baltimore News Guild has a unit of 109 employees at the Baltimore Sun; if the distinctions between Baltimore Sun journalists and the community journalists were to disappear, the union might well be justified in seeking to expand the bargaining unit. \u201cThat\u2019s just our assumption,\u201d says Scott Dance, chair of the Baltimore Sun\u2019s bargaining unit. \u201cIt\u2019s not our rule, it\u2019s their rule. They don\u2019t want the nonunion staff intermingling with us. \u2026 We\u2019ve always thought it didn\u2019t make sense how they kept it so separate, and these reporters are doing the duties that our suburban unionized bureaus once did.\u201d\n\nThe setup is sufficiently Byzantine that if the Baltimore Sun needs a quote or another reportorial nugget from a community reporter, she has to channel it through her editor, who then contacts an editor at the community newspaper, who then passes it along to the community reporter. \u201cIt\u2019s very inefficient. It has led to inaccuracies, for sure,\u201d says Dance. For example: If Dance is working on a big story about a crippling blizzard, he can take feeds from Baltimore Sun reporters and seek clarifications and amplifications directly from those colleagues.

Gary Palmer (Ala.), Rep. Liz Cheney (Wyo.), Rep. Jason T. Smith (Mo.), Rep. Steve Scalise (La.), and Rep. Mark Walker (N.C.), listen during a news conference after a GOP leadership election on Capitol Hill, on Wednesday. (Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg News)\n\nRep. Kevin McCarthy (Calif.) ascended to the top job in House Republican leadership Wednesday, while Rep. Liz Cheney (Wyo.) followed in her father\u2019s footsteps by taking the party\u2019s No. 3 spot.\n\nMcCarthy prevailed over Rep. Jim Jordan (Ohio), 159 to 43, according to the House press gallery, while Cheney was elected by voice vote.\n\nSpeaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.) is stepping down at the end of his term in January. That opened up the top leadership spot, which \u2014 after the party lost its House majority in last week\u2019s midterm election \u2014 will be minority leader.\n\n\u201cWe took a beating inside the suburban areas. We\u2019re going to have to work harder,\u201d McCarthy said at a news conference following Wednesday\u2019s vote, acknowledging Republican losses.\n\nHe also partially blamed the GOP defeat on former New York mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who spent more than $110 million in support of Democrats.\n\nMcCarthy and Jordan, a leader of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, had announced their bids for the minority leader position. McCarthy, who currently serves in the No. 2 spot as House majority leader, made a bid for speaker in 2015 but stepped aside amid pressure from conservatives. With Ryan\u2019s backing \u2014 as well as a close relationship with President Trump \u2014 McCarthy triumphed over Jordan.\n\nThe California Republican has leveraged his alliance with Trump to his advantage on Capitol Hill, where the president looms large over the House GOP conference. Trump has referred to McCarthy as \u201cmy Kevin\u201d since before his inauguration, and McCarthy has at times gone to great lengths to curry favor with Trump, both through legislation \u2014 such as by introducing a bill that would appropriate more than $23 billion to Trump\u2019s plans for a U.S.-Mexico border wall \u2014 and other means, such as sending the president his favorite candies.\n\nAt Wednesday\u2019s news conference, McCarthy accused Democrats of having an agenda focused principally on investigating \u2014 and potentially impeaching \u2014 Trump. House Democrats have signaled in recent days that they plan to aggressively probe the actions of the executive branch, although they have resisted calls by activists to immediately impeach the president.\n\nMcCarthy also claimed that Bloomberg, who is mulling a 2020 presidential bid, had specifically targeted female Republican candidates.\n\n\u201cHe focused on women who were Republican, and unfortunately, a lot of races became close. . . . I think that is wrong that someone picked upon gender,\u201d McCarthy said.\n\nHe later clarified his remarks, saying that Bloomberg \u201cpicked against Republicans, but he spent a great deal amount of money against Republican women.\u201d\n\nMcCarthy had come under fire last month for a tweet in which he contended that Bloomberg, environmentalist Tom Steyer and philanthropist George Soros were trying to \u201cBUY the election!\u201d McCarthy later deleted the tweet, which came around the same time that prominent Democrats, including Steyer and Soros, were being targeted by mail bombs.\n\nThe No. 2 spot of House minority whip was claimed Wednesday by Rep. Steve Scalise (La.), who serves in the third-ranking role in House GOP leadership. Scalise had considered challenging McCarthy but announced last week that he was pursuing the minority whip spot instead.\n\nCheney, who first won election in 2016 and is the daughter of former vice president Richard B. Cheney, won the No. 3 spot of House Republican Conference chair. She made her bid for the spot on Nov. 7 with a letter to colleagues in which she criticized Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (Wash.), who has held the position for three terms. McMorris Rodgers announced the next day that she was stepping aside from her leadership role and seeking to climb the ranks of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.\n\nThe elder Cheney, who served as GOP conference chair from 1987 to 1989, was present for Wednesday\u2019s vote for his daughter.\n\n\u201cHe told me not to screw it up,\u201d Liz Cheney told reporters with a laugh Wednesday afternoon when asked what advice she received from her father.\n\nJohn Wagner contributed to this report.", "EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier holds the draft withdrawal agreement during a media conference in Brussels on Wednesday, Nov. 14, 2018.

The required number currently stands at 48 lawmakers, and only Graham Brady, the keeper of the letters, knows for sure how many have been submitted.\n\nSome lawmakers who previously said they wanted May to change course now suggest they want a new leader.

Failure to secure Cabinet backing will leave May\u2019s leadership in doubt and the Brexit process in chaos.\n\nIf Cabinet supports the deal Wednesday, it needs approval from the EU at a summit in the next few weeks. Then May will need to win backing from Parliament, where pro-Brexit and pro-EU legislators alike are threatening to oppose it.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(Calla Kessler/The Washington Post)\n\n. \u2014 Pfc. Jordan Wilson and Alexis Espinoza Padilla stood 500 miles apart in separate worlds, and yet undeniably were linked by practical and geopolitical forces.\n\nWilson, 25, and his fellow U.S. soldiers worked in the shadow of the Brownsville and Matamoros International Bridge crossing into Mexico, stretching out 50-foot rolls of barbed concertina wire with a metallic jangle near the banks of the Rio Grande on Sunday afternoon. His green camouflage uniform, helmet, body armor, protective glasses and thick gloves were required by commanders, even if he was working stateside. Just a block away, civilians walked to a Dollar General discount store.\n\nA few hours earlier, Espinoza Padilla, 23, fiddled with a cord connecting his cellphone to a solar-powered battery pack on the outskirts of Santiago de Queretaro in central Mexico. He wore a sweater and had pulled his cap down low to protect him from the sun while waiting for a ride in a truck heading north.\n\nThe two 20-somethings are at the center of an issue that could percolate for weeks: the potential arrival of a caravan of thousands of migrants at the U.S. border at a single location and the military\u2019s possible role in dealing with it.\n\nThe Trump administration has dispatched more than 5,900 active-duty troops to the border to buttress U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents processing asylum claims. Federal law and Pentagon policy limit the scope of what the troops can do, although the military has said they could be asked to fly CBP officers in helicopters to less-secure parts of the border if the caravan attempts to enter the country there.\n\nThe first group of migrants, meanwhile, decided last week to turn west toward Tijuana and began arriving there Tuesday. They numbered a few hundred on Wednesday. They could disperse into smaller groups, but other caravan groups are still farther away in Mexico and it is unclear where they will go.\n\nOn the border, U.S. service members are expected to cede all law enforcement missions to the Department of Homeland Security, adhering to the Posse Comitatus Act and Pentagon regulations.\n\nBut some sort of significant encounter remains a possibility, even as Wilson and some of his fellow soldiers struggle with how to characterize their mission.\n\n\u201cThis will kind of be like my deployment here, if you call it that,\u201d said Wilson, who has been in the Army less than two yearsand has not yet been overseas.\n\nAsked what he would call it, he said he wasn\u2019t sure, but would do his job to the best of his ability.\n\n\u201cI shrug,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know the answer.\u201d\n\nWire, the mission's motif\n\nIn Texas, images of soldiers stringing concertina wire emerged just before the midterm elections and have become the main motif of the mission. More than 150 miles are available, military officials have said. The Pentagon initially called the operation Faithful Patriot, but disclosed just after the election that it had stripped it of that name amid complaints that it had partisan overtones. The military now simply refers to operations as \u201cborder support,\u201d and plans to send the troops home by Dec. 15.\n\n\n\nA group of Salvadorans jump over the fence on the border between Guatemala and Mexico in Tecun Uman, Guatemala, on Nov. 2, 2018. (Carlos Garcia Rawlins/Reuters)\n\nWilson, of the 887th Engineer Support Company of Fort Campbell, Ky., and his fellow soldiers arrived in Brownsville last week to string the wire between the Matamoros bridge and the Gateway International Bridge, less than a mile northeast. CBP officials said they once found a hole cut in the chain-link fence near the Dollar General, Wilson said, presumably allowing someone to slip into Brownsville.\n\nIn response, the Army delivered scores of wooden pallets stacked with concertina. Halfway through the one-mile task, more than 40 of the 50-foot rolls were stacked on each pallet. Wilson looked on as soldiers put about a dozen pallets at a time on a 10-wheel flatbed truck and drove it from a CBP parking lot down a hill that was covered in scrub brush and dying castor bean plants. They parked it on a sandy bank near the Rio Grande.\n\nThere, the troops pulled the pallets off the truck on skids, broke them down and got to work.\n\n\u201cI bet you five bucks we have to take all this down in a few weeks,\u201d one soldier said to a friend while they tied wire. The fellow soldier scoffed at him.\n\nIn a statement to The Washington Post, the CBP said the issue is not yet settled.\n\nDefense Secretary Jim Mattis and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen visited soldiers at the border in Texas on Wednesday. When one asked whether the Army would have to remove the wire, Mattis said: \u201cWe\u2019ll let you know.\u201d\n\nSelling smokes to buy a phone\n\n\n\nSoldiers put up concertina wire on a border fence near the Brownsville and Matamoros Express International Bridge.

Two sisters in Texas, both undocumented, told him he could go back to Honduras but that it was worth trying to reach the United States, he said.\n\nStanding near a highway toll booth Sunday, he prepared to shift west, toward the city of Irapuato, and eventually California. His father, in a red baseball cap, a tan jacket and jeans, wore a yellow wristband from Mexico City, where officials had tried to count a group that seemed uncountable, as nobody one stayed still for long.\n\nEspinoza Padilla said he left home without a phone, but bought one on the road using money he and his father made by selling cigarettes for a peso each \u2014 more when people were stressed out.

As night fell, the blanket would protect her from the cold. It was not as good as the tents that other people carried.

Officials in Palm Beach County faced problems with the counting machines themselves and have said they can\u2019t guarantee they\u2019ll be done Thursday.\n\nRepresentatives of both parties attended a \u201cwalk-through\u201d at the Broward elections office to prepare for the manual recount expected to follow in the very tight Senate race, in which Sen. Bill Nelson (D) trails Gov. Rick Scott (R) by fewer than 13,000 votes out of more than 8 million cast.\n\n[Read: How voter signatures took out outsized importance this year]\n\nA state judge in Hillsborough County ruled in Scott\u2019s favor to allow his campaign\u2019s monitors into the room where the recount is taking place. And Nelson\u2019s campaign, along with state Democrats, filed a new lawsuit requesting to inspect records in Bay County, where the election supervisor has said that in the aftermath of Hurricane Michael, he let voters submit ballots electronically, an apparent violation of state law.\n\nBoth campaigns were awaiting a court decision on Nelson\u2019s request to count absentee and provisional ballots that were not tallied because voters\u2019 signatures did not match their voter registration records. A five-hour hearing wrapped up Wednesday without an immediate decision.\n\nAnd more courtroom drama was coming Thursday: Hearings were scheduled in state court in Broward County in two lawsuits that Republicans filed against Broward elections supervisor Brenda Snipes, one of them over 25 ballots that were counted after the first unofficial returns were reported to the state.\n\nRepublicans ramped up their accusations of voter fraud against Democrats after the Department of State, which oversees elections in Florida, asked state law enforcement officials and federal prosecutors to investigate allegations that state Democrats sent incorrect voting instructions to mail-in voters in four counties.\n\nThe complaint includes examples of four voters who mailed in absentee ballots that lacked sufficient information and were sent follow-up affidavits. Instructions for completing the affidavits said the deadline was last Thursday, two days after the election; the actual deadline was last Monday, the day before the election.\n\nAt least three of the four voters affected were Democrats, according to their local election offices, so it\u2019s unclear why someone at the state Democratic Party would give them the wrong deadline or who altered the form.\n\nIt is also unclear how many voters received incorrect instructions or how many ballots went uncounted as a result. The Florida Democratic Party did not respond to a request for comment. But Republicans pounced, alleging that Democrats had intentionally encouraged voters to cast or fix ballots after Election Day in the hopes of persuading judges to count those votes.\n\n\u201cAfter all, an influx of Democratic voters trying to cast their ballots after the deadline could make it easier for Democrats and liberal groups to play games with the legal process and ultimately fight to change the law \u2014 just like they are doing right now,\u201d read an email distributed by the Scott campaign Wednesday.\n\nThe request appears to be the first time the department has flagged allegations of voting irregularities this year. The department has declined to call for an investigation in Bay County, a predominantly Republican part of Florida; Scott has also declined to weigh in on the situation.\n\nThe Senate race will determine the size of the GOP\u2019s majority in 2019 and shape the power structure in the nation\u2019s largest swing state. Together, the two sides have racked up at least 10 lawsuits trying to gain a legal advantage in the recount.\n\nU.S. District Judge Mark Walker presided over a tense hearing Wednesday in a Tallahassee courthouse but recessed without announcing a decision. Reporters and campaign officials packed three rows of seats inside the courtroom, while cameras were staked out in the rain.\n\nWalker seemed open to the possibility of allowing a new and limited window for voters to \u201ccure\u201d their rejected ballots. He reminded lawyers of how important even a limited number of votes could be.\n\n\u201cDo we just dismiss 500 votes? Because last time I checked, 500 votes determined the leader of the free world,\u201d Walker said, making a reference to the Florida recount in 2000 that led to the election of George W. Bush.\n\nRepublican attorneys argued that ruling in a way that would allow the counting of some ballots that were disqualified over signature mismatch would amount to a major disruption to a vote-tallying operation that has already been stretched to its limits.\n\nThere are nearly 3,700 vote-by-mail ballots that were set aside because of signature mismatch across 45 counties, according to a partial tally from state officials presented by one of the GOP attorneys. The count does not include 22 counties.\n\nBoth candidates, meanwhile, were in Washington on Wednesday. At a photo opportunity for new Republican senators, Scott declined to answer questions about whether he still thinks the vote count in Florida has been tainted by fraud.\n\nScott recused himself from a state commission that certifies the election results, as he did in 2014, when he ran for reelection. But the move is unlikely to satisfy Democrats, who have demanded that he remove himself from any decision-making in the state\u2019s administration of elections.\n\nAlthough Scott has been a vocal critic of Democrats during the recount, Republican gubernatorial nominee Ron DeSantis has been much quieter. DeSantis, a close ally of President Trump, has a more comfortable margin over Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum (D). Democrats and Republicans are not anticipating a hand recount in the governor\u2019s race. Votes also are being recounted in the race for state agriculture commissioner.\n\nReinhard reported from Lauderhill, Fla., and Gardner reported from Fort Lauderdale, Fla.

Buses and trucks are carrying some migrants into the state of Sinaloa along the Gulf of California and further northward into the border state of Sonora. The bulk of the main caravan appeared to be about 1,100 miles from the border, but was moving hundreds of miles per day. (Marco Ugarte/Associated Press)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on Wednesday defended the use of active duty troops on the U.S.-Mexican border, saying that in some ways it provides good training for war. He argued that it\u2019s analogous to a 1916 deployment to counter the Mexican revolutionary Gen. Francisco \u201cPancho\u201d Villa.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on his way to visit U.S. troops along the border in south Texas, Mattis declined to provide an estimate of how much the mission will cost. He said cost figures he has received thus far are \u201cnot anywhere near right.\u201d He added that he believes, \u201cvery quickly we\u2019ll know the real cost. So we\u2019ll keep you posted as the real costs come in.\u201d\n\nIn his most extensive remarks about the hastily arranged border mission, Mattis argued that it fits an historical pattern dating to early in the 20th century. He noted that President Woodrow Wilson deployed tens of thousands of National Guard and active duty troops to the border in 1916 in response to a Mexican military raid into the U.S.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s over a century ago, and the threat then was Pancho Villa\u2019s troops \u2014 revolutionary raiding across the border into the United States,\u201d he said. He noted that more recently, National Guard troops were used in border missions ordered by President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama, although not on the cusp of a midterm election.\n\nThe Pentagon chief said that within a week to 10 days the 5,800 troops currently deployed for the border mission will have accomplished all the tasks initially requested by Customs and Border Protection, although additional tasks are now being worked out between the Pentagon and the Department of Homeland Security. Mattis did not say how soon the mission might end; current deployments are scheduled to last until Dec. 15, but that could change.\n\nIn addition to the 5,800 active duty troops in the border area, about 2,100 National Guard troops have been providing border support since April.\n\nCritics have questioned the wisdom of using the military on the border where there is no discernible security threat, although President Donald Trump has said that a caravan of Central American migrants traveling northward through Mexico amounts to an \u201cinvasion.\u201d Since the election, Trump has said little about the matter, and no border threat has yet materialized.\n\nAsked whether he believes there is a security threat at the border that justifies the use of the active duty military, Mattis said he defers to the judgment of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, who joined him at the border Wednesday.\n\nNielsen and Mattis spoke with senior U.S. commanders and addressed rank-and-file troops. Mattis told the troops their mission is to \u201cback up\u201d Customs and Border Protection. \u201cRight now that\u2019s our role and that\u2019s all our role is,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe eyes of the world right now \u2014 certainly all of the Americans \u2014 are on you,\u201d Mattis told the soldiers, adding that they are part of a \u201cnon-traditional\u201d mission. \u201cWe\u2019re here because of the number of illegals who say they are going to illegally try to cross into our country,\u201d he said, apparently referring to the several thousand migrants moving north through Mexico.\n\nOne soldier asked Mattis what are the short- and long-term plans for the military mission.\n\nMattis said the short-term objective is to get sufficient numbers of wire and other barriers in place along the border as requested by Customs and Border Protection. The longer-term objective, he said, is \u201csomewhat to be determined.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re in something like this,\u201d Mattis said, \u201cit\u2019s dynamic, it\u2019s unpredictable. We\u2019ll have to see.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with reporters traveling with him to Texas, Mattis took issue with assertions by critics that the deployment undertaken shortly before the Nov. 6 midterm elections was costing the military in preparedness for combat. He said military officers have told him that the deployment has been \u201cvery good training\u201d because it amounts to a rehearsal for the kind of logistical demands \u2014 such as loading aircraft \u2014 that must be met in wartime.\n\n\u201cIn terms of readiness, it\u2019s actually, I believe, so far improving our readiness for deployments,\u201d he said.\n\nMattis said the mission, which does not include performing law enforcement tasks, was reviewed by Department of Justice lawyers and deemed a legal undertaking. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously a moral and ethical mission to support our border patrolmen,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nAP Radio correspondent Sagar Meghani contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Ian Livingston/The Washington Post)\n\nWinter is fast approaching. And if you\u2019ve been following the forecast, you know wintry weather is approaching even faster.\n\nAs fall gives in to winter, and we see bouts of chillier and chillier weather in the weeks ahead, we\u2019ll be hearing more of the big wintertime buzzwords. Chief among them: snow, sleet and freezing rain.\n\nBut what\u2019s the difference between these wintry precipitation types? It all comes down to processes happening high up in the sky.\n\nSnow\n\nThe simplest form of wintry precipitation is snow, and it\u2019s the coolest. Snowflakes form when water vapor crystalizes on something like dust or pollen that makes its way into the atmosphere. From there, a six-sided ice crystal develops.\n\n\n\nMagnified snowflakes. (NOAA)\n\nYou can probably guess what the temperature profile is like \u2014 cold all the way down! No melting, no refreezing. Instead, a snowflake just has to delicately waft its way from the clouds to the ground.\n\nIt may surprise you, however, to know that it doesn\u2019t have to be freezing at ground level for it to snow. Flurries have been observed at temperatures as warm as 49 degrees. It can snow when it\u2019s above freezing when the warm layer near the ground is shallow and the air aloft is cold, and the flakes don\u2019t have a chance to melt.\n\nSleet\n\nSleet is a bit more of a wild card for forecasters.\n\n\n\nA typical sleet setup. (University of Illinois)\n\nStarting off as snow, sleet forms when this snow passes through a relatively shallow warm layer and partially melts. It then passes back into a deep layer of frozen air. In contrast, freezing rain, discussed below, doesn\u2019t have enough time to refreeze before hitting the surface, as sleet does.\n\nBecause of its melting and refreezing, sleet doesn\u2019t boast nearly as much of a \u201cfluff factor\u201d as snow. An inch\u2019s worth of rain might only stack up to three inches or so of sleet. For comparison, the same liquid equivalent might fall as eight to 12 inches of snow on average, with higher or lower ratios largely depending on the temperature.\n\nMost of the time when sleet falls, the surface temperature is very close to freezing. Sometimes the ground is just above that crucial threshold. Even then, thanks to the density of sleet, it might cause headaches as it takes time to melt. Sleet pellets and crushed-up granules can also deposit an icy film over the road, making it very easy to skid.\n\nBefore moving on, we must briefly address how sleet is not hail, since they are often confused.\n\nHail is formed in convective updrafts. That\u2019s when the rising air in a thunderstorm lofts water droplets high enough into the atmosphere to reach freezing temperatures \u2014 even in the steamy dog-days of summer. It\u2019s this vigorous upward motion that sustains the hailstone and allows it to grow bigger and bigger until it outweighs the force of the updraft. Although they are both balls of ice, sleet and hail are formed through considerably different processes.\n\nFreezing rain\n\nFreezing rain is perhaps the species of wintry precipitation most hated by forecasters and the public. It\u2019s challenging to predict, it is extremely dangerous, and it is quite finicky.\n\n\n\nSmall differences aloft can lead to many different precipitation types. (National Weather Service)\n\nFreezing rain is exactly what it sounds like \u2014 rain that freezes on contact. It typically begins as snow, then falls through a large enough warm layer to fully melt the snow. Unlike the air that creates sleet, the cold air nearest the ground is not thick enough to fully refreeze it. The rain instead becomes supercooled so it can more easily freeze on contact.\n\nFreezing rain is especially hazardous following cold-air outbreaks, when days of repeated freezing conditions permeate the soil and lower the ground temperature below 32 degrees. It then takes only small amounts to turn sidewalks and streets into treacherous sheets of ice.\n\nIce storms caused by freezing rain can be far more destructive than snowstorms because of the full weight of ice accumulating on all surfaces. Although it takes only a trace of ice to be a big problem, the worst freezing rain events can bring two to three inches or more of ice accretion. They can shut down entire communities for days and take down virtually every power line.\n\nGraupel\n\nGraupel is an oddball.\n\nIt looks a bit like sleet, but it\u2019s generally softer, larger and cloudier. Sometimes called snow grains or snow pellets, graupel starts as snow. In a process somewhat similar to hail formation, graupel develops as the snowflakes get \u201crimed\u201d and grow larger as additional ice builds on them as they are picked up by updrafts in a shower. Riming transforms your typical snowflake into something of a ball.\n\nLike sleet, graupel is relatively common in above-freezing conditions at the surface.

And in the not-so-distant someday when telescopes become capable of photographing planets around other stars, it may well be the first new world we see.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re moving from science fiction to science reality,\u201d said Carnegie astronomer Johanna Teske, who contributed to a study of the new planet published Wednesday in the journal Nature. \u201cThere\u2019s so much possibility there.\u201d\n\n\n\nAn illustration of the relative distances to the nearest stars from the sun. Barnard\u2019s Star is the second closest star system. (Guillem Ramisa/IEEC/Science Wave)\n\nThe exoplanet\u2019s sun, a tiny body known as Barnard\u2019s Star, is one of our solar system\u2019s nearest neighbors. The only stars closer are the triplet stars of the Alpha Centauri system, which is mainly visible in the southern sky. One of those stars, Proxima Centauri, is orbited by a small planet, but the star\u2019s tendency to spew flares of deadly radiation means its planet is unlikely to be habitable.\n\nBarnard\u2019s Star has long been \u201cthe great white whale\u201d of exoplanet hunting, said Carnegie astronomer Paul Butler, a co-author on the Nature paper. It\u2019s just six light-years from our sun, and possibly twice as old. One of the main architects of exoplanet research, the astronomer Peter van de Kamp, proposed more than 50 years ago that this star could host a planet. In the 1970s, British astronomers studied the possibility of sending an uncrewed starship to probe the alien system \u2014 even though there wasn\u2019t any evidence a planet existed to be explored.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t until the first exoplanet discovery was confirmed in 1995 that the search for a world around Barnard\u2019s Star began in earnest.\n\nThis red dwarf is a 10th the mass of our sun and too faint to be seen with the naked eye. But its low mass makes it ideal for analysis using the radial velocity technique of exoplanet detection, which exploits the way a planet\u2019s gravitational pull makes a star wobble as it orbits around it.\n\nA slew of telescopes on three continents have set their sights on Barnard\u2019s Star, allowing researchers to accumulate some 800 observations over the course of 20 years. The study authors also drew on data collected by amateur astronomers.\n\nIt took the combined efforts of more than 50 researchers at some two dozen institutions, but \u201cslowly a signal in our data came out of all the noise,\u201d said astronomer Ignasi Ribas, who is director of the Institute of Space Studies in Catalonia, Spain, and the lead author of the Nature paper.\n\n\n\nAn artist\u2019s impression of the view from the surface of a planet orbiting Barnard's Star. (M. Kornmesser/European Southern Observatory)\n\nBarnard\u2019s Star\u2019s periodic wobble suggests it is circled by a large planet once every 233 days. Very few exoplanets have been found so far from their stars (planets with short orbital periods generate more frequent signals, making them easier to detect).\n\nBecause Barnard\u2019s Star is so dim, the planet\u2019s long orbital period puts it at the \u201csnow line,\u201d where sunlight is so faint that its surface is perpetually frozen. Its average surface temperature is possibly a brisk -150 degrees Celsius (-238 degrees Fahrenheit).\n\nThis puts the planet outside the traditional \u201chabitable zone,\u201d where conditions are thought to be ripe for life. But Teske pointed out that microbes are resilient creatures; if there is water on the planet and if other necessary ingredients are present, it\u2019s feasible that organisms might lurk in an ocean beneath the ice.\n\nYet much about the planet around Barnard\u2019s Star remains uncertain. Astronomers aren\u2019t sure if it\u2019s rocky like Earth or built of gas and ice, like Neptune. They know it must be at least three times as massive as Earth, but it could be even larger.\n\nThey aren\u2019t even 100 percent certain the planet is there, Ribas noted. The research pushed the limits of the radial velocity detection technique, which becomes more difficult the farther a planet is from its star. Mathematical models suggest there is still a 0.8 percent chance that Barnard\u2019s Star\u2019s apparent wobble is caused by some other factor, like sunspots. For that reason, the exoplanet is deemed a \u201ccandidate,\u201d rather than a confirmed discovery.\n\n\u201cDifficult detections such as this one warrant confirmation by independent methods and research groups,\u201d Rodrigo Diaz, an astronomer at the University of Buenos Aires who was not involved in the research, wrote in a commentary for Nature. But if it\u2019s confirmed, the \u201cremarkable planet\u201d would give \u201ca key piece in the puzzle of planetary formation and evolution,\u201d he wrote.\n\nRead more:\n\nAs NASA\u2019s prized telescopes falter, astronomers fear losing their eyes in space\n\nSo long, Kepler, and thanks for all the planets\n\nScientists think they\u2019ve found the first moon outside our solar system", "\n\nKatie Hill, a Democratic candidate from California's 25th Congressional District, waves at supporters during an election watch party on Nov. 6 in Santa Clarita. (Marcio Jose Sanchez/AP)\n\nThis article was updated on Nov. 15.\n\nIt is perhaps more apt to describe the results of the 2018 midterm elections not as a wave in favor of the Democrats but as a tsunami. Not because of scale, though the Democratic gains in the House were substantial, but because tsunamis build slowly and steadily, water pushing inland slowly covering ever more territory. A wave hits and crashes. A tsunami just keeps coming.\n\nThere are, as of writing, two House contests in California that have not yet been resolved. In both cases, the Republicans are in a tough position. Katie Porter (D) leads incumbent Rep. Mimi Walters (R) by a narrow margin. Young Kim (R) leads Gil Cisneros (D) \u2014 but the margins as votes are counted have favored Cisneros. Both Porter and Cisneros are favored to win by FiveThirtyEight.\n\nIf or when they do, it will cap a remarkable stretch since polls closed Tuesday last week. Contested House races in California have been toppling in the Democrats' direction ever since. Even if Kim pulls out a victory in the 39th District, the Democrats will hold 44 of the state\u2019s 53 seats \u2014 83 percent of the total.\n\nThe last time Democrats held as high a percentage of California\u2019s House seats, the Civil War was raging. In fact, Democrats then held all of California\u2019s seats \u2014 or, put another way, both of them.\n\nUsing data compiled by MIT Election Data and Science Lab, we evaluated how much of each state\u2019s House delegation either party has held since 1976. The density of each party\u2019s control of seats after each election is shown from left to right. (Uncalled 2018 races are attributed to the currently leading party.)\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nThere are some interesting patterns in the graph above. You can see, for example, the trend in most Southern states away from the Democratic Party over the past 40 years. Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019s tenure as Vermont\u2019s sole representative stands out distinctly. Massachusetts\u2019s long record of electing solidly Democratic House delegations stands out, as well.\n\nOn Thursday, Maine\u2019s 2nd District was called for Democrat Jared Golden. That means that there are no longer any Republicans serving in the House in New England -- and only one Republican, Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) -- serving in Congress from the region at all.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nWhat\u2019s obscured a bit in the annual data above but revealed in that second map are how many states\u2019 House delegations are now as densely partisan as they\u2019ve been at any point in the past 40 years. In the most recent elections, 28 states elected representatives from each party who match the highest density of one party or the other since 1976. Four states \u2014 including California \u2014 set new highs in the dominance of the Democratic Party in their congressional representation.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nHere, too, there are interesting patterns. This map mirrors, to a large extent, the safest presidential states in any given year for each party. One exception is Iowa, which is redder than this would suggest. (After the 1964 elections, Iowa was more solidly Democratic than it is now, with nearly twice as many representatives.) New York is bluer, but it had a higher peak of Democratic density a decade ago.\n\nThat only 19 states aren\u2019t at peak partisanship seems remarkable and apparently a natural reflection of the political moment. That four states are more partisan than at any point in the last 40 years itself seems remarkable.\n\nBut, then, this was a Democratic tsunami year, and Republican strongholds are still getting washed away.", "Women were expected to turn out in large numbers this midterm elections \u2014 and they did.

(Evan Vucci/Associated Press)\n\nA handful of prominent conservative and libertarian attorneys are banding together to form Checks and Balances, a group that grew from their need to publicly reaffirm the importance of the rule of law, which they feel is being threatened by the Trump administration.\n\nThe group, organized by George T. Conway III, husband of White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, rallies behind the notion that it is important for lawyers who see President Trump\u2019s actions as unconstitutional to speak up.\n\n\u201cThere is a deep-seated concern and uneasiness in conservative legal circles with the president\u2019s attacks on our institutions, including the press and the Department of Justice, and a belief that conservative lawyers are not speaking up enough,\u201d John B. Bellinger, top legal adviser for the State Department and National Security Council under President George W. Bush, told The Post.\n\nThis effort was intended to stimulate discussion among conservative lawyers around the country, particularly as the Federalist Society gathers for its annual conference in Washington on Thursday.\n\nHaving three functioning branches of government is the healthiest way for a democracy to work, said Marisa Maleck, a former law clerk to Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. Since Trump took office, he has repeatedly attempted to consolidate the power of those branches himself, she said.\n\n\u201cThe worst part about it is that he normalizes it. Most people don\u2019t realize what he\u2019s doing poses a threat to a constitutional democracy,\u201d she said.\n\nIn a mission statement released Tuesday, the group wrote: \u201cWe believe in the rule of law, the power of truth, the independence of the criminal justice system, the imperative of individual rights and the necessity of civil discourse. We believe these principles apply regardless of the party or persons in power. We believe in \u2018a government of laws, not of men.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Checks and Balances roster also includes, among others, Tom Ridge, a former Pennsylvania governor and George W. Bush administration secretary of homeland security; professors Orinn Kerr and Jonathan Adler; Peter D. Keisler, acting attorney general in the Bush administration; and attorney Lori S. Meyer, who is married to Federalist Society President Eugene B. Meyer.\n\nMost, if not all, are active members of the Federalist Society and believe in limited judicial function, Paul Rosenzweig, a senior fellow at the R Street Institute and a former official in George W. Bush\u2019s Department of Homeland Security, told The Post.\n\nRosenzweig said the moment that triggered each person to join was different.\n\nFor him, it was Charlottesville and Trump\u2019s undermining of the free press. \u201cThe idea of bombs being sent to CNN and embracing a political representative who has actually assaulted the press doesn\u2019t sit well with me,\u201d he said, referencing Trump\u2019s praise of Rep. Greg Gianforte (R-Mont.), who assaulted a journalist last year. \u201cAll of us believe in conservative legal principles and in the need to stand up for them no matter who is the president.\u201d\n\nAdler cited his growing concern about how partisan lines are drawn. \u201cIn the current hyperpartisan environment, people are finding it challenging to criticize those seen as on their side,\u201d he said.\n\nOther members have pointed to Trump\u2019s ouster of Jeff Sessions as attorney general and installation of Matthew G. Whitaker as acting attorney general.\n\nConway, the group organizer, said, \u201cThere wasn\u2019t any one thing; it\u2019s a long series of events that made me think that a group like this could do some good.\u201d\n\nConway has authored a series of articles attacking Trump\u2019s politics, most recently an opinion piece in the New York Times that called Whitaker\u2019s appointment unconstitutional.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s illegal. And it means that anything Mr. Whitaker does, or tries to do, in that position is invalid,\u201d Conway wrote. He similarly called the president\u2019s plan to end birthright citizenship unconstitutional.\n\nLawyer Alan Charles Raul, a top legal official in the Ronald Reagan and both Bush administrations, said that what makes America great are constitutional values and rule-of-law norms.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t just count on that remaining strong and a shared value for all Americans if we don\u2019t speak up for them and show concern when we see them being challenged,\u201d he said.\n\nGroup members envision Checks and Balances taking on several concerns with the Trump administration. They include respect for the rule of law, constitutional principles that support freedom of expression, due process, and not politicizing any particular criminal prosecution.\n\nThey are unified in hoping that the group will provoke discussion among lawyers to ensure that attacks on American institutions do not become normal across the country.\n\nMaleck said that this is not the way American democracy should be functioning.\n\n\u201cIt reminds me of the Edmund Burke quote, \u2018The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cBefore Trump does lasting damage, someone needs to say that enough is enough.

(Evan Vucci/Associated Press)\n\nA handful of prominent conservative and libertarian attorneys are banding together to form Checks and Balances, a group that grew from their need to publicly reaffirm the importance of the rule of law, which they feel is being threatened by the Trump administration.\n\nThe group, organized by George T. Conway III, husband of White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, rallies behind the notion that it is important for lawyers who see President Trump\u2019s actions as unconstitutional to speak up.\n\n\u201cThere is a deep-seated concern and uneasiness in conservative legal circles with the president\u2019s attacks on our institutions, including the press and the Department of Justice, and a belief that conservative lawyers are not speaking up enough,\u201d John B. Bellinger, top legal adviser for the State Department and National Security Council under President George W. Bush, told The Post.\n\nThis effort was intended to stimulate discussion among conservative lawyers around the country, particularly as the Federalist Society gathers for its annual conference in Washington on Thursday.\n\nHaving three functioning branches of government is the healthiest way for a democracy to work, said Marisa Maleck, a former law clerk to Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. Since Trump took office, he has repeatedly attempted to consolidate the power of those branches himself, she said.\n\n\u201cThe worst part about it is that he normalizes it. Most people don\u2019t realize what he\u2019s doing poses a threat to a constitutional democracy,\u201d she said.\n\nIn a mission statement released Tuesday, the group wrote: \u201cWe believe in the rule of law, the power of truth, the independence of the criminal justice system, the imperative of individual rights and the necessity of civil discourse. We believe these principles apply regardless of the party or persons in power. We believe in \u2018a government of laws, not of men.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Checks and Balances roster also includes, among others, Tom Ridge, a former Pennsylvania governor and George W. Bush administration secretary of homeland security; professors Orinn Kerr and Jonathan Adler; Peter D. Keisler, acting attorney general in the Bush administration; and attorney Lori S. Meyer, who is married to Federalist Society President Eugene B. Meyer.\n\nMost, if not all, are active members of the Federalist Society and believe in limited judicial function, Paul Rosenzweig, a senior fellow at the R Street Institute and a former official in George W. Bush\u2019s Department of Homeland Security, told The Post.\n\nRosenzweig said the moment that triggered each person to join was different.\n\nFor him, it was Charlottesville and Trump\u2019s undermining of the free press. \u201cThe idea of bombs being sent to CNN and embracing a political representative who has actually assaulted the press doesn\u2019t sit well with me,\u201d he said, referencing Trump\u2019s praise of Rep. Greg Gianforte (R-Mont.), who assaulted a journalist last year. \u201cAll of us believe in conservative legal principles and in the need to stand up for them no matter who is the president.\u201d\n\nAdler cited his growing concern about how partisan lines are drawn. \u201cIn the current hyperpartisan environment, people are finding it challenging to criticize those seen as on their side,\u201d he said.\n\nOther members have pointed to Trump\u2019s ouster of Jeff Sessions as attorney general and installation of Matthew G. Whitaker as acting attorney general.\n\nConway, the group organizer, said, \u201cThere wasn\u2019t any one thing; it\u2019s a long series of events that made me think that a group like this could do some good.\u201d\n\nConway has authored a series of articles attacking Trump\u2019s politics, most recently an opinion piece in the New York Times that called Whitaker\u2019s appointment unconstitutional.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s illegal. And it means that anything Mr. Whitaker does, or tries to do, in that position is invalid,\u201d Conway wrote. He similarly called the president\u2019s plan to end birthright citizenship unconstitutional.\n\nLawyer Alan Charles Raul, a top legal official in the Ronald Reagan and both Bush administrations, said that what makes America great are constitutional values and rule-of-law norms.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t just count on that remaining strong and a shared value for all Americans if we don\u2019t speak up for them and show concern when we see them being challenged,\u201d he said.\n\nGroup members envision Checks and Balances taking on several concerns with the Trump administration. They include respect for the rule of law, constitutional principles that support freedom of expression, due process, and not politicizing any particular criminal prosecution.\n\nThey are unified in hoping that the group will provoke discussion among lawyers to ensure that attacks on American institutions do not become normal across the country.\n\nMaleck said that this is not the way American democracy should be functioning.\n\n\u201cIt reminds me of the Edmund Burke quote, \u2018The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cBefore Trump does lasting damage, someone needs to say that enough is enough. It\u2019s important that it comes from people in his own party.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nFive days of fury: Inside Trump\u2019s Paris temper, election woes and staff upheaval\n\nThe House Democratic majority risks the same dysfunction as the Republicans.

It was hailed as a historic moment in the history of the conflicted Horn of Africa.\n\nThe sanctions were put in place in 2009 after U.N. experts said Eritrea was arming and training al-Shabab and other militants seeking to undermine the government in Somalia. The Eritrean government denied the allegation and primarily attributed the sanctions to U.S. opposition.\n\nIt has been several years since the United Nations has offered any evidence to support the claim against Eritrea.

A group of surgeons, many of them gun owners, have new gun-safety recommendations based on their experience treating the wounded. (Ethan Miller/Getty Images)\n\nThe decades-old battle over the role medical professionals should play in reducing gun violence erupted onto social media in the past week after the National Rifle Association admonished doctors to \u201cstay in their lane\u201d rather than share thoughts about gun safety. Members of the medical profession took to Twitter with a viral \u2014 and often graphic \u2014 campaign detailing the damage guns do to the human body, and the frequent efforts doctors must take to save the lives of those who have been shot, under the hashtag #Thisisourlane.\n\nNow, a work group from the American College of Surgeons has chimed in with the release Wednesday of a new set of gun-safety recommendations that aims to bridge the political divide. The recommendations, which include robust background checks, enhanced gun-safety training, mandatory reporting requirements for people considered a threat to themselves or others, and the use of innovative technologies to prevent accidental firearms discharge, are striking not so much for their content as their authorship.\n\n[\u2018Being silenced is not acceptable\u2019: Doctors express outrage after NRA tells them \u2018to stay in their lane\u2019]\n\nEighteen of the 22 surgeon-authors are passionate firearms owners, including hunters, self-defense proponents and doctors with previous military experience.\n\nThe paper is \u201ca brilliant application of well-established social science,\u201d said Jeremy Faust, an emergency physician at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston and instructor at Harvard Medical School.

As gun owners, they understand the issues that non-gun owners might not fully appreciate.\u201d\n\nThe group\u2019s recommendations come at a time when the long-standing divides over firearms have become increasingly polarized amid a steady torrent of deadly mass shootings in places many had long deemed safe: at school, in church, in synagogue, at a concert.

The gun-safety and sporting group evolved into a powerful pro-firearms lobby and encouraged Congress to pass the Dickey Amendment in 1996, effectively cutting funding for gun violence research at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe NRA did not immediately respond to a request for comment after the report was released at noon on Wednesday.\n\nTwo weeks ago, on Oct. 30, the American College of Physicians published a position paper recommending \u201ca public health approach\u201d to firearms-related violence and saying that the medical profession has a \u201cspecial responsibility\u201d to speak out.

(Photo by Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nFederal employee salaries on average lag behind those of the private sector by almost 31 percent, an advisory council said Tuesday, while splitting between union and non-union members on whether to recommend potential changes in the way it arrives at that figure.\n\nThe average salary difference of 30.91 percent reported by the Federal Salary Council is somewhat smaller than the 31.86 percent it reported at a special meeting it held April. The figures of prior years were in the 34 to 35 percent range.\n\nThose figures, based on two Labor Department surveys covering some 250 occupations, stand in contrast to assessments of some conservative and libertarian organizations that have concluded that the advantage is about the same or even greater in favor of federal employees.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office last year essentially split the difference. It found an average advantage for federal workers of 3 percent, although within that average it said there is a wide range by educational level: from a 34 percent advantage for federal workers with a high school education or less to a 24 percent shortfall for those with a professional degree or doctorate.\n\nUnder a federal pay law, the \u201cpay gap\u201d as measured by the Salary Council is to be used in setting annual raises varying by locality for federal employees under the General Schedule, the pay system covering most white-collar employees below the executive levels. However, that law never has been followed due to the potential cost of paying such large raises and disagreements over how the figure is calculated.\n\nIn an August message to Congress, President Trump said that following the law\u2019s formula would result in locality-based raises in January 2019 averaging 25.7 percent plus an across-the-board raise of 2.1 percent, at a cost of $25 billion. \u201cFederal agency budgets cannot sustain such increases,\u201d Trump\u2019s said in backing a pay freeze that he originally proposed in a budget plan early this year.\n\nA House-Senate conference underway on a spending bill will decide between a freeze and a Senate provision to pay an average 1.9 percent raise. Unless Congress passes, and Trump signs, a bill specifying a raise, salaries will be frozen by default. If the raise is enacted, it would vary slightly among 44 city areas and what is called the \u201crest of the U.S.\u201d locality everywhere else; employees working in the Washington-Baltimore area would stand to receive one of the larger raises, probably around 2.3 percent.\n\nThe long-running controversy over comparing salaries flared at Tuesday\u2019s meeting of the Salary Council, a group of federal employee unions and compensation experts whose decisions typically are unanimous.\n\nA \u201cworking group\u201d document produced since the April meeting laid out a series of potential changes for consideration by a higher-level body called the President\u2019s Pay Agent. Those options included adding more detailed data on salaries by occupation and level of work, taking into account other data such as attrition rates, switching to a \u201ctotal compensation\u201d approach taking benefits into account, and conducting a very detailed review only once every four or five years \u2014 the latter two of which would require a change in law.\n\nCouncil chairman Ron Sanders, a longtime career federal personnel official who is now a clinical professor at the University of South Florida School of Public Affairs, argued in favor of exploring those options. \u201cI think it\u2019s obvious to all of us that the current methodology is problematic,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThat methodology does not tell the whole story,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to say there\u2019s a 30 percent gap. If OMB [the Office of Management and Budget] doesn\u2019t believe it, the White House doesn\u2019t believe it, the Congress doesn\u2019t believe it, what good does it do?\u201d\n\nHe pointed to the testimony of officials of federal agencies from several urban and rural areas not now receiving higher city-based locality pay, who told of their difficulties in recruiting and retaining employees despite using special hiring authorities and incentive payments. However, the current process doesn\u2019t support specific salary rates for them, he said.\n\nTwo other members supported exploring the options: Katja Bullock, associate director of presidential personnel, and Jill Nelson, who leads an advisory committee on pay for blue-collar federal employees.\n\nHowever, members from federal unions argued against changing the calculations and questioned whether the group even has the authority to raise new options for consideration. \u201cI don\u2019t think the methodology is broken,\u201d said J. David Cox Sr., president of the American Federation of Government Employees.\n\n\u201cThe elephant in the room is the Congress and the president over time not funding the pay system\u201d as the law intended, said Randy L. Erwin, president of the National Federation of Federal Employees. Anthony M. Reardon, president of the National Treasury Employees Union, expressed concern that including the value of federal benefits \u201cwill be used as a justification to reduce those benefits.\u201d\n\nThe council adjourned without voting on whether to recommend that the Pay Agent consider different approaches. Afterward, Sanders said that in the annual report to that higher-level body to be made by year\u2019s end, individual members of the Salary Council could express their own opinions.", "Technology columnist\n\nThe little camera on this phone has a superpower: It can see things our eyes cannot.\n\nAt night for the past few weeks, I\u2019ve been tromping around dark places taking photos using a new mode on Google\u2019s $800 Pixel 3 called Night Sight. Friends in a candlelit bar look like they brought a lighting crew. Dark streets are flush with reds and greens. A midnight cityscape lights up as though it were late afternoon. It goes way beyond an Instagram filter into you-gotta-see-this territory.\n\nNight Sight is a super step forward for smartphone photography \u2014 and an example of how our photos are becoming, well, super fake.\n\nIt\u2019s true \u2014 you don\u2019t look like your photos. Photography has never been just about capturing reality, but the latest phones are increasingly taking photos into uncharted territory.\n\nFor now, Night Sight is only a mode that pops up in dark shots on Google\u2019s Pixel phones. But it\u2019s hardly alone: All sorts of phonemakers brag about how awesome their photos look, not how realistic they are. The iPhone\u2019s \u201cportrait mode\u201d applies made-up blur to backgrounds and identifies facial features to reduce red-eye. Selfies on phones popular in Asia automatically slim heads, brighten eyes and smooth skin. And most recent phones use a technique called HDR that merges multiple shots to produce a hyper-toned version of reality.\n\nWhen I recently took the same sunset photo with an iPhone 6 from 2014 and this year\u2019s iPhone XR, I was gobsmacked at the difference \u2014 the newer iPhone shot looked as though it had been painted with watercolors.\n\nWhat\u2019s happening? Smartphones democratized photography for 2.5 billion people \u2014 taking a great photo used to require special hardware and a user manual.\n\nNow artificial intelligence and other software advances are democratizing creating beauty. Yes, beauty. Editing photos no longer requires Photoshop skills. Now when presented with a scenic vista or smiling face, phone cameras tap into algorithms trained on what humans like to see and churn out tuned images.\n\nYour phone has really high-tech beer goggles. Think of your camera less as a reflection of reality and more an AI trying to make you happy. It\u2019s faketastic.\n\n\n\nGoogle's Pixel 3 and the iPhone XS find a lot more light on these San Francisco landmarks than was visible to the eye. But Night Sight on the Pixel finds much more. (Geoffrey A. Fowler/The Washington Post)\n\nSoftware is king\n\nSnapping a photo on a phone has become so much more than passing light through a lens onto a sensor. Of course, that hardware still matters and has improved over the past decade.\n\nBut increasingly, it\u2019s software \u2014 not hardware \u2014 that\u2019s making our photos better. \u201cIt is hyperbole, but true,\u201d says Marc Levoy, a retired Stanford computer-science professor who once taught Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin and now works for them on camera projects including Night Sight.\n\nLevoy\u2019s work is rooted in the inherent size limitations of a smartphone. Phones can\u2019t fit big lenses (and the sensors underneath them) like traditional cameras, so makers had to find creative ways to compensate. Enter techniques that replace optics with software, such as digitally combining multiple shots into one.\n\nNew phones from Apple, Samsung and Huawei use it, too, but \u201cwe bet the ranch on software and AI,\u201d Levoy says. This liberated Google to explore making images in new ways.\n\n\n\nTwo portraits taken during San Francisco's Day of the Dead parade. The one shot with Google's Night Sight is sharper and more colorful than the one shot with the iPhone XS. (Geoffrey A. Fowler/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cGoogle in terms of software has got an edge,\u201d says Nicolas Touchard, the vice president of marketing at DxOMark Image Labs, which produces independent benchmark ratings for cameras. (Whether any of this is enough to help the Pixel win converts from Apple and Samsung is a separate question.)\n\nWith Night Sight, Google\u2019s software is at its most extreme, capturing up to 15 low-light shots and blending them to brighten up faces, provide sharp details and saturate colors in a way that draws in the eye. No flashes go off \u2014 it artificially enhances the light that\u2019s already there.\n\nAnyone who has attempted a low-light shot on a traditional camera knows how hard it is not to take blurry photos. With Night Sight, before you even press the button, the phone measures the shake of your hand and the motion in the scene to determine how many shots to take and how long to leave the shutter open. When you press the shutter, it warns \u201chold still\u201d and shoots for up to six seconds.\n\nOver the course of the next second or two, Night Sight divides all its shots into a bunch of tiny tiles, aligning and merging the best bits to make a complete image. Finally, AI and other software analyze the image to pick the colors and tones.\n\nNight Sight had some difficulty with focus and in scenes with almost no light. And you \u2014 and your subject \u2014 really do have to hold that pose. But in most of my test shots, the product was fantastical. Portraits smoothed out skin while keeping eyes looking sharp. Night landscapes illuminated hidden details and colored them like Willy Wonka\u2019s chocolate factory.\n\nThe problem is: How does a computer choose the tones and colors of things we experience in the dark? Should it render a starlit sky like dusk?\n\n\u201cIf we can\u2019t see it, we don\u2019t know what it looks like,\u201d Levoy says. \u201cThere are a lot of aesthetic decisions. We made them one way, you could make them a different way. Maybe eventually these phones will need a \u2018What I see\u2019 versus \u2018What is really there\u2019 button.\u201d\n\n\n\nHere's what the camera can produce vs. what it actually sees. This same shot was taken with a Google Pixel 3 using Night Sight in the camera app and then again using the \"raw\" shooting mode in the Adobe Lightroom app. (Geoffrey A. Fowler/The Washington Post)\n\nFaketastic\n\nSo if our phones are making up colors and lighting to please us, does it really count as photography? Or is it computer-generated artwork?\n\nSome purists argue the latter. \u201cThis is always what happens with disruptive technology,\u201d Levoy says.\n\nWhat does \u201cfake\u201d even mean? he asks. Pro photographers have long made adjustments in Photoshop or a darkroom. And before that, makers of film tweaked colors for a certain look. It might be an academic concern if we weren\u2019t talking about the hobby \u2014 not to mention the memories \u2014 of a third of humanity.\n\nHow far will phones remove our photos from reality? What might software train us to think looks normal? What parts of images are we letting computers edit out? In a photo I took of the White House (without Night Sight), I noticed the algorithms in the Pixel 3 trained to smooth out imperfections actually removed architectural details that were still visible in a shot on the iPhone XS.\n\nAt DxOMark, the camera measurement firm, the question is how to even judge images when they\u2019re being interpreted by software for features such as face beauty.\n\n\u201cSometimes manufacturers are pushing too far,\u201d Touchard says. \u201cUsually we say it is okay if they have not destroyed information \u2014 if you want to be objective, you have to consider the camera a device that captures information.\u201d\n\nFor another perspective, I called Kenan Aktulun, the founder of the annual iPhone Photography Awards. Over the past decade, he has examined over a million photos taken with iPhones, which entrants are discouraged from heavily editing.\n\nThe line between digital art and photography \u201cgets really blurry at some point,\u201d Aktulun says. Yet he ultimately welcomes technological improvements that make the photo-creating process and tools invisible. The lure of smartphone photography is that it\u2019s accessible \u2014 one button and you\u2019re there. AI is an evolution of that.\n\n\u201cAs the technical quality of images has improved, what we are looking for is the emotional connection,\u201d Aktulun says. \u201cThe ones that get a lot more attention are not technically perfect. They\u2019re photos that provide insight into the person\u2019s life or experience.\u201d\n\nRead more tech advice and analysis from Geoffrey A.

Sandys/The Washington Post) (Toni Sandys/Washingon, D.C.)\n\nJosh Norman isn\u2019t the first player to voice his displeasure with some fans booing the Redskins at FedEx Field, and this year\u2019s Redskins team isn\u2019t the first winning squad in franchise history to be jeered by the home crowd.\n\n\u201cWe come back to our home and it seems like guys don\u2019t really care,\u201d Norman said after Sunday\u2019s win in Tampa Bay. \u201cThey just boo everything and aren\u2019t really behind us. We don\u2019t really feel that [support]. And I\u2019m tired of it, really.\"\n\nWelcome to the club, Mr. Norman. Norm Snead felt your pain once. President Nixon, Super Bowl MVP Mark Rypien and rookie linebacker Robert Henson, too. Here\u2019s a look back at the history of Redskins fans booing their favorite team at home, which, as is true with most fan bases, dates back to the earliest years of the franchise.\n\n1940: The NFL Championship Game\n\nThe public address announcer at sold-out Griffith Stadium failed to read the room. With the Redskins trailing the Chicago Bears 48-0 late in the third quarter of an eventual 73-0 loss, he announced that season tickets for the 1941 season were on sale. The boos that followed, The Post\u2019s Shirley Povich wrote, \u201cwere probably the champion in Griffith Stadium history . . . To the ill-timed announcement, which was the worst bit of showmanship ever to hit the stadium, the fans gave full-throated sarcasm.\u201d\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long for Redskins fans to get over the humiliating and record-breaking defeat. There wasn\u2019t a season ticket unsold in 1941.\n\n1956: A change comes over Redskins fans\n\nRedskins fans apparently weren\u2019t big booers during the franchise\u2019s first two decades in D.C.\n\n\u201cUnlike pro football crowds in Pittsburgh or Philadelphia, to cite two notable examples, Washington fans don\u2019t boo the Redskins when things go wrong, they just get awfully quiet,\u201d The Post\u2019s Jack Walsh wrote in October 1956.\n\nEvery fan base has its breaking point, and after the Redskins suffered a 23-0 loss to the Steelers in their home finale, Post columnist Bob Addie expressed his disappointment with the boo-birds at Griffith Stadium.\n\n\u201cPerhaps the unkindest cut of all was the scornful remark made my many of the spectators who labeled the Redskins \u2018a bunch of bums,\u2019\u201d Addie wrote. \u201cHow fickle, indeed, is affection. The Redskins went a long way with little talent but a tremendous fighting spirit. Even the teams they beat, didn\u2019t think of the Redskins as championship caliber. Just because the Redskins couldn\u2019t go all the way is no reason to sour on them. Our fans certainly didn\u2019t distinguish themselves last Sunday.\u201d\n\n1970: \u201cMaybe they should ban booze\u201d\n\nFickle fans booed quarterback Sonny Jurgensen in the first quarter of Washington\u2019s Week 6 game against the Bengals at RFK Stadium. The Redskins were leading 10-0 at the time and improved to 3-3 with a 20-0 win, their first shutout since 1964.\n\n\u201cThey buy tickets and they have the right to do whatever they like to,\u201d Redskins Coach Bill Austin said of the boos.\n\n\u201cShort of coming on the field,\u201d Charley Taylor added.\n\nThe home fans were less civil after a 45-21 loss to the Cowboys in November dropped the Redskins to 4-6. There were several fights in the stands, and Jurgensen was hit in the head with a stone after the game.\n\n\u201cI think it is all right for our fans to voice their dissatisfaction with their mouths, but not physically,\u201d Austin said. \u201cMaybe they should ban booze in the stands . . . I thought Jurgensen did pretty well. I don\u2019t know whether the boos were directed at him or the whole group of players.\"\n\n1971: President Nixon empathizes with the Redskins\n\nDuring a Week 10 loss to the Cowboys, Redskins fans booed when starting quarterback Billy Kilmer, not Jurgensen, took the field at the start of the second half with Washington trailing 7-0. Coach George Allen pulled Kilmer in favor of Jurgensen late in the third quarter, but the Redskins lost anyway, 13-0.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t help any when you\u2019re playing at home where you\u2019re supposed to have the favor of the crowd,\u201d running back Charley Harraway said. \u201cIt definitely didn\u2019t make you feel welcome.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it was terrible,\u201d offensive lineman Jim Snowden said. \u201cEverybody should be behind us. I\u2019m very disappointed at the fans' reaction.\"\n\n\u201cWhen I came here I thought they were the greatest fans in the world,\u201d offensive lineman George Burman said. \u201cI didn\u2019t think there was any reason for this today. Bill called a good game, he executed well. But the fans have the right. They pay their seven bucks. We\u2019ve got to get untracked. We\u2019ve got to deserve the cheers.\u201d\n\n\n\nPresident Nixon visited Redskins Park in 1971. (AP) (Associated Press)\n\nTwo days after the loss, President Nixon made a surprise visit to Redskins practice and delivered an impromptu pep talk.\n\n\u201cWin or lose, you\u2019ve already been great for the city,\u201d Nixon told the team during his 45-minute visit. \u201cThe whole city is proud of you . . . I\u2019ve heard plenty of boos myself in my lifetime. Don\u2019t let it bother you. A great majority of people in this town back the team.\u201d\n\nNixon predicted the 6-3-1 Redskins would win their next game against the Eagles and make the playoffs, but he wouldn\u2019t go so far as to say they\u2019d overtake the Cowboys and win the division.\n\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t any votes in Washington, but there are in Texas.\u201d quipped Nixon, who followed Allen\u2019s coaching career because Allen previously coached at his alma mater, Whittier.\n\nThe Post\u2019s editorial board even weighed in on the boos:\n\n\"Think Sonny\u201d they were shouting, when they might have been thinking of how the Redskins have gotten where they are without Sonny and Charley Taylor, and with [Larry] Brown and Harraway in and out with injuries, and with Jerry Smith sidelined. Yet there they were after the half last Sunday, 6-2-1, a half game out front, still not beaten and not disgracing themselves either, and getting booed. It was almost enough to lead us into acknowledgment of some part of the argument made elsewhere on this page today by Colman McCarthy -- that football is in fact a dehumanizing experience. Almost, but not quite. It is said that the crowd pays for the privilege of booing, and that is so; but that doesn\u2019t make it any the less an act of faithlessness, or any the less dispiriting for the Over-the-Hill Gang and the walking wounded and the rest when they are already 13 points down. It is also said that the boos were for George Allen -- but for what? For bringing Washington its best record since World War II? The Washington Post\n\nThe Redskins would beat the Eagles and rally to clinch a postseason berth that season.\n\n1987: \u201cWhat if we\u2019d lost?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want the Scabs! We want the Scabs!\u201d Redskins fans chanted during the first game after the 1987 NFL players\u2019 strike ended. Washington\u2019s regulars overcame a 16-7 deficit in the fourth quarter to beat the Jets.\n\n\u201cI think all the guys got ticked offed about that,\u201d lineman Mark May said. \u201cYou\u2019re playing in front of your home crowd and they want to bring back the scabs. I mean, it\u2019s not too fulfilling.\u201d\n\n[Redskins players remain proud they stuck together during 1987 strike]\n\n\u201cBooing was something I heard quite a bit in Atlanta, but no one expected it happening here,\u201d guard R.C. Thielemann said. \u201cI guess we probably deserve it. We had the odor of a cesspool for the first three quarters.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, they didn\u2019t mean it,\u201d linebacker Monte Coleman said.\n\n\"What if we\u2019d lost? center Jeff Bostic said.\n\n1988: Booing a Super Bowl MVP, Part I\n\nRedskins fans were booing the defending Super Bowl champions long before the Eagles finally gave their fan base the opportunity to do so this year.\n\n\u201cThis booing of Doug Williams stinks,\u201d The Post\u2019s Tony Kornheiser wrote in November 1988 after Williams, who won Super Bowl MVP honors the previous season, struggled in a loss that dropped Washington to 6-5. \u201cStop it. Was Jan. 31 so long ago that none of you can remember back that far? . . . Sports fans have a right to ask, What have you done for me lately? But not, What have you done for me in the last two minutes? Curiously, you haven\u2019t booed Joe Jacoby when his man is on top of Williams quicker than instant oatmeal. You haven\u2019t booed Gary Clark for dropping passes. You haven\u2019t booed Darrell Green when he gets beat. Even all-pros make mistakes, but you cut them some slack and load up on Williams. It\u2019s a tradition in this city. From Jurgensen, to Kilmer, to Theismann, to Schroeder, to Williams. Boo the starting quarterback. Get the other guy onto the field.\"\n\n1992: Booing a Super Bowl MVP, Part II\n\nThe tradition of booing the starting quarterback continued in 1992, when Redskins fans jeered Mark Rypien in the home opener, eight months after he won Super Bowl MVP honors. Rypien, who became the NFL\u2019s second-highest paid player after holding out during training camp, wasn\u2019t happy with the reception, and fired back at the fans.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been here seven years,\u201d Rypien said after leading the Redskins to a win over the Falcons. \u201cI\u2019ve worked my tail off to try to do the best job I can. So I have no control over that [booing]. They might need a little work in getting crowd noise. If that\u2019s their best effort, then Dallas has some great fans. That\u2019s my shot back at 'em.\"\n\n\u201cTo boo this guy after the season he had shows the people who inhabit RFK aren\u2019t as smart as they\u2019re portrayed,\u201d The Post\u2019s Michael Wilbon wrote. \u201cStop it.\u201d\n\nRypien apologized to fans during an appearance on Channel 4 the next day, but was booed again during the Redskins' 13-10 win over the Lions the following week.\n\n1994-96: The Heath Shuler years\n\nShuler, who signed the largest rookie deal in NFL history after the Redskins drafted him third overall, was booed in his home preseason debut while completing 9 of 22 passes for 61 yards. The former University of Tennessee star said it was the first time he\u2019d been booed in his life.\n\n\u201cI thought it was pretty funny,\u201d Shuler said. \u201cI went to a great high school with great fans. In college we had the best fans in America. I assumed coming here we would have the same thing. But they were just disappointed. We\u2019ll find out about the real fans when we start winning.\u201d\n\n[Narrator\u2019s voice:] The Redskins didn\u2019t start winning.\n\nShuler was backing up Gus Frerotte in 1996 when Frerotte had the wind knocked out of him during a home game against the 49ers. Fans booed Shuler as he ran onto the field for his first snap of the season, which resulted in a 14-yard loss by Leslie Shepherd on a botched reverse.\n\n\u201cIt was not a lot of class, it just doesn\u2019t show a lot,\u201d Shuler said of the fans' reaction. \u201cThey\u2019re probably not going to love me any more by me saying that. I got a chance to play, and I was glad I had a chance to play. I\u2019d have liked the play to have worked out better, but that\u2019s over with. I always thought you should cheer the guy who\u2019s coming in. I tried not to pay attention to the boos. Personally, I was listening for the applause, and I heard the people who did applaud, and that\u2019s what you want to hear. That\u2019s how you know who the true fans are . . . It was a sad thing, but I guess they boo everybody. It\u2019s a part of being a fan.\u201d\n\n2001: It costs a lot more to boo these days than it used to\n\nTackle Jon Jansen noticed the boos after the Redskins fell to 0-3 with a 45-13 loss to the Chiefs.\n\n\u201cThey pay their $65; they\u2019re entitled to their opinion,\u201d Jansen said. \u201cThe only time it bothers me is when I get a chance to go out to dinner with my wife and people come up and do the same thing.\u201d\n\n\n\nRedskins rookies Kevin Barnes, left, and Robert Henson were tied to the goal post during training camp in 2009. (Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP)\n\n2009: Robert Henson\u2019s folly\n\nThe Redskins were booed during an uninspired 9-7 win over the Rams in their 2009 home opener.\n\n\u201cI thought it was a shame, to be honest with you,\u201d tight end Chris Cooley said in the locker room. \u201cI think Washington prides themselves on being the best fans, and I think that they should try to be the best fans. We won. I understand they wanted us to beat the Rams by 40, but we still won, and we if we continue to win games, that\u2019s great. Booing\u2019s unnecessary.\u201d\n\nRookie linebacker Robert Henson, a sixth-round pick out of TCU, agreed, and he let it be known on social media.\n\n\u201cAll you fake half hearted Skins fan can . . . I won\u2019t go there, but I dislike you very strongly, don\u2019t come to Fed Ex to boo dim wits!!\u201d Henson tweeted.\n\nRather than stop there, Henson engaged with fans who didn\u2019t take too kindly to his criticism.\n\n\u201cNo I didn\u2019t play but I still made more than you in a year and you\u2019d [gladly] switch spots with me in a second,\u201d he replied to one fan. \u201cI was talking to the fans [who] said the crazy stuff, I\u2019m use [to heckling] but I\u2019ve never been booed in my own stadium.

(Capital Weather Gang and Pivotal Weather)\n\nNot much has changed as we watch this system develop late this evening. It still appears that precipitation should be moving into the area in the hours around sunrise. This means a messy commute is a given.\n\nThe focus of any icy troubles is likely to be in the 7 to 11 a.m. period, when some snow and mixed precipitation spreads across the area. Accumulation odds continue to be best north and west of Interstate-95, and increasing as one heads north and west from there. There is also some chance that precipitation could come down heavily right away, at least for a time. If this occurs, conditions could go downhill quick. Do plan to start early, check in with us, and take it slow if you are headed out.\n\n4:05 p.m. - Winter weather advisory issued for D.C. area; winter storm warning toward Interstate 81\n\nThe National Weather Service has issued a winter weather advisory for the District and surrounding area from 4 a.m. to 1 p.m. Thursday. It is forecasting up to an inch of sleet and snow and the possibility of a light (0.1 inches) glaze of ice.\n\nThis advisory extends until 4 p.m. in our far north and west suburbs, including northwest Montgomery, northern Fauquier, and Loudoun counties, where frozen precipitation is likely to last longer due to colder temperatures. In these areas, there is higher potential for an icy glaze (up to 0.2 inches) on top of the snow and sleet. In Frederick County, Md. and to its east across northern Maryland, the Weather Service forecasts one to two inches of snow and sleet accumulation.\n\n\n\nAdvisories and warnings in effect on Thursday. (National Weather Service)\n\nEven farther west, along the Interstate 81 corridor from Harrisonburg, Va. to Hagerstown, Md. and to the west, a winter storm warning is in effect from 4 a.m. Thursday to 4 a.m. Friday for up to 2 to 5 inches of snow and sleet and an icy glaze up to 0.25 inches thick.\n\nAdvisories are not in effect in Southern Maryland, where mostly rain is predicted.\n\nFrom earlier...\n\nAn unusually cold November storm brought snow and sleet as far south as Houston on Tuesday and West Monroe, La., on Wednesday. On Thursday, the storm will arrive in the Washington region, probably offering a smorgasbord of precipitation types: snow, sleet, rain and freezing rain. Some of this precipitation will fall heavily.\n\nThe period of greatest concern is between about 7 a.m. and 11 a.m., coinciding with the morning commute, when temperatures will be lowest and the chance of frozen precipitation highest. This is your typical Washington winter weather event in which conditions will tend to deteriorate as you head into the colder areas north and west of the Beltway, where the chance of snow and sleet accumulation and slick spots is greatest.\n\nPrecipitation may begin briefly as light rain in the predawn hours before changing to snow and/or sleet by dawn. Any snow is likely to be short-lived, as temperatures at high altitudes will be increasing, but sleet and pockets of freezing rain may continue through the morning. However, in locations south and east of the Beltway, any frozen precipitation should change to plain rain as the morning wears on.\n\nDuring the late morning and afternoon, precipitation from the Beltway and to the northwest should gradually transition to plain rain. Frozen precipitation will last longest in our far northern and western areas, perhaps well into the afternoon west and north of Warrenton, Leesburg and Frederick. Some of these areas are under a winter storm watch because of the potential for accumulating snow and sleet, as well as a glaze of freezing rain on top.\n\n\n\nForecast radar from NAM model early Thursday through Friday morning.\n\nInside the Beltway and to the south and east, air and road temperatures should be high enough so that frozen precipitation that falls, mostly in the morning, melts. However, a few slick spots cannot be ruled out during any heavier bursts of frozen precipitation \u2014 which are possible during the morning commute Thursday.\n\nFarther to the north and west, the possibility that sleet and snow coats roads increases, especially those that are untreated, as well as bridges, ramps and overpasses.\n\nPrecipitation will be heaviest across the region between about 9 a.m. and 3 p.m., but areas of light rain and drizzle (possibly freezing rain and drizzle in our coldest locations) will linger through Thursday night (rain may mix with or change to wet snow briefly before ending in our northern areas). The equivalent of at least one inch of precipitation (from melted snow and ice, and rain) should fall in most areas. If Washington receives this much precipitation, it will move into the fourth spot among the wettest calendar years on record.\n\nThis is an event where just a few degrees will make a big difference in how much snow and wintry mix occurs and where, so surprises are possible if not likely. The setup makes it \u201ctricky to tell how long the below freezing surface temperatures will hold across the area north and west of the Beltway,\u201d said Wes Junker, the Capital Weather Gang\u2019s winter weather expert.\n\nThis type of winter weather in Washington so early in the season is uncommon. If accumulating snow or sleet manages to materialize in Washington, it will mark the first time in November since 1996.\n\n[It could snow in Washington on Thursday. How often does that happen in November?]\n\nForecasts by zone\n\nAs conditions will vary widely over the region, from mostly rain in Southern Maryland to substantial amounts of frozen precipitation toward the Interstate 81 corridor, we\u2019ve divided the region into four zones, shown on the map below.\n\n\n\n(The Washington Post Staff/Washington, D.C.)\n\nHere is how we see the event evolving, zone by zone, and the expected impact.\n\nZone 1: Northern Maryland, eastern panhandle of West Virginia and northwest Virginia\n\n(Includes Winchester, Hagerstown, Frederick and Westminster)\n\nModerate accumulations of snow and sleet (one to three inches) and a glaze of freezing rain are possible in this region, as temperatures will be lowest here, and precipitation is likely to remain in a frozen form for a good portion of the event.\n\nPrecipitation should begin as snow and sleet early Thursday morning, and then transition to more sleet and freezing rain as the morning wears on. Some areas could change to plain rain during the afternoon, but pockets of freezing rain may linger even into the evening in some of the colder valleys in the western parts of this zone.\n\n\n\nForecast temperatures between Thursday morning and Thursday night from high-resolution NAM model.\n\n\u201cThe high-resolution models suggest that the temperatures at the surface could stay below freezing for an extended period of time in our typical colder locations north and west of the city,\u201d Junker said.\n\nA winter storm watch is in effect in the western part of this zone, along and west of the Interstate 81 corridor, where temperatures will be lowest. Because of freezing rain, a glaze of up to 0.25 inches could build up on trees and power lines, leading to outages. Untreated roads, driveways, parking lots and sidewalks could turn hazardous.\n\n\n\nIce accumulation forecast on Thursday. (National Weather Service)\n\nThe expected conditions rate as a Level 2 out of 5, or \u201cdisruptive\u201d winter weather event on our winter storm impact scale. The effects will be magnified by the fact that the wintry mix will coincide with the morning commute and that this is the first winter storm of the season \u2014 meaning people have less recent experience dealing with such conditions.\n\nZone 2: Washington\u2019s and Baltimore\u2019s north and west suburbs\n\n(Includes Warrenton, Leesburg, Rockville, Columbia and Towson)\n\nMixed precipitation should begin just before dawn and snow and/or sleet is likely to put down a coating to an inch through midmorning or so. More sleet than snow is likely to fall. Road surfaces, especially those that are untreated, could turn slick.\n\nSome areas may change to plain rain by late morning, and most areas should do so during the afternoon, but there may be a few colder spots (sheltered valleys) where temperatures hardly budge \u2014 which would allow for a slick glaze of freezing rain to develop.\n\nThe freezing rain risk may be mitigated by the fact that precipitation will fall heavily at times and make it hard for ice to adhere to surfaces such as trees and power lines. Also, temperatures in this zone may hover right around freezing (between 30 and 34 degrees) \u2014 and would need to be lower for a more serious ice buildup.\n\nOn our winter storm impact scale, this event is Level 1 \u2014 a nuisance winter storm (note that in our assessment this was close to Level 2, so it is a high-end nuisance event). Although widespread hazardous conditions are unlikely, pockets of slick travel are a good bet, and some school delays and cancellations cannot be ruled out.\n\nZone 3: The immediate Washington area and city of Baltimore\n\n(Includes Gainesville, Manassas, Fairfax, Bethesda, Laurel and Annapolis)\n\nPrecipitation may begin as light rain predawn but transition to a wintry mix of sleet and snow around sunrise through the midmorning hours. Then the wintry mix may transition to rain. However, it\u2019s possible that pockets of sleet and freezing rain linger into the early afternoon in some of the colder areas.\n\nTemperatures in this zone will be near if not above freezing, generally limiting accumulation. However, slick spots could form during any heavy bursts of frozen precipitation.\n\nEven if icy travel does not materialize, roads will be wet, and visibility will be reduced because of the messy mix of falling precipitation \u2014 so allow extra time to reach your destination.\n\nStorm conditions do not merit a rating on our impact scale in this zone. We generally do not expect delays and cancellations in this zone, unless conditions turn out to be worse than expected.\n\n\u201cFor snow lovers, the combination of being November and the upper-level storm track being a tad north of where you want it pretty much killed our chances for any meaningful snow around the city,\u201d Junker said.\n\nZone 4: Far southern suburbs and Southern Maryland\n\n(Includes Fredericksburg and La Plata)\n\nExpect mostly a cold rain in this zone. A little sleet or wet snowflakes could mix with the rain during the early morning, but roads should mostly remain just wet.", "\n\nLong Island City is one of two cities chosen by Amazon for its much-touted HQ2 expansion. Over the past decade, the neighborhood has been gentrified and now has a mix of original and new businesses. (Spencer Platt/Getty Images)\n\nLONG ISLAND CITY, NEW YORK \u2014 Lorraine Romano has owned her two-family house here for 42 years, raising her children and, more recently, hosting visiting grandchildren.\n\nBut Romano, a manager at a neighborhood Italian restaurant, found herself in an unusual position Tuesday: The house she had had on the market for months was suddenly besieged by buyers.\n\n\u201cOur broker called us and described the offers, which people made right after the Amazon news,\u201d Romano noted as she worked phones and oversaw the kitchen at the restaurant, Manducatis, on Tuesday afternoon. \u201cI said: \u2018I\u2019m ready. It\u2019s time to get out.\u2019 \u201d\n\nSince word came Monday that the online giant would make this slowly gentrifying Queens neighborhood across the water from midtown Manhattan the site of one of its new headquarters, it has sparked enthusiasm from New York Mayor Bill de Blasio and New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and anger from many local politicians.\n\n\u201cWe are witness to a cynical game in which Amazon duped New York into offering unprecedented amounts of tax dollars to one of the wealthiest companies on Earth,\u201d Michael Gianaris and James Van Bramer, Long Island City\u2019s state senator and city council member, noted in a joint statement about the deal, which could ultimately bring as many as 25,000 high-wage jobs but comes with as much as $1.53 billion in government tax incentives.\n\nBut the reaction in this neighborhood of 20,000 has been more complicated. Some longtime residents, contrary to the conventional wisdom about local resistance, welcomed the opportunity to cash out or add to their consumer base.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, not all newcomers, who over the past decade have essentially presaged the Amazon move, are excited about the deal.\n\nOne thing everyone agrees on, though: Amazon did not start this fire.\n\n\u201cThis neighborhood is already changed,\u201d Romano said. \u201cThis just will make it change even more.\u201d\n\n[Amazon's fast expansion invites growing political scrutiny]\n\nIf New York City is a microcosm of the country\u2019s real estate boom of the past decade, Long Island City is a microcosm of New York.\n\nGentrification was promised long ago to this land of faded warehouses, factories and pockets of rough-eared one- and two-family homes. The Citicorp building \u2014 a 50-story glass office tower \u2014 opened in 1990 a half-mile east of the new Amazon site. The first luxury condominiums on the neighborhood\u2019s waterfront opened in the late 1990s.\n\nThe area remained largely forgotten for years. Other places, including Hoboken, N.J., to the west and Williamsburg, Brooklyn, to the south, leaped above it on the upscaling curve.\n\nIt was not until the housing crisis a decade ago, when the market moved from owning to renting, that change took hold. The area is catnip to developers of luxury rentals: It sits several minutes by subway from Grand Central Terminal, contains striking views across the East River and has a smaller-town feel than many New York neighborhoods. Rents could be set high \u2014 if not quite Manhattan-high, then certainly enough to be awash in profits. Tenants could pay as much as $3,500 for a one-bedroom apartment.\n\nDevelopers built high-end luxury apartment towers, many of them teasing New York City skyline views.\n\nIn fact, since 2010 Long Island City has seen the most new rental apartments of anywhere in the country, nearly double that of the next-highest neighborhood, downtown Los Angeles. Locally these buildings are known as \u201cthe high-rises\u201d and are the vertical equivalent of living in a swanky estate.\n\nOn Tuesday, the day of Amazon\u2019s announcement, the effects of this shift were on display, as Pilates studios, high-end bakeries and craft breweries could be seen on and near the main street of Vernon Boulevard. Even a barber shop was artisanal.\n\nThe popularity has had some unintended effects. Arthur Mull, who three years ago opened the boutique pharmacy Nature\u2019s Prescriptions, said the initial promise has given way to the threat of corporate incursion.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been difficult. CVS just opened across the street,\u201d he said. \u201cAmazon is part of the same trend.\u201d (The company\u2019s chief executive, Jeffrey P. Bezos, owns The Washington Post.)\n\n[Washington won its piece of Amazon's HQ2. Now comes the hard part.]\n\nOne woman pushing a baby stroller who lives in the high-rises but spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the issue\u2019s sensitivity said she was not in favor of Long Island City\u2019s newest occupant, even though she was part of the same wave that swept it in.\n\nShe was worried, she said, about what Amazon\u2019s arrival would mean for the subway, whose aging infrastructure has already been buckling under massive ridership increases in recent years. (The 7 train that serves the area is routinely ranked as one of New York City\u2019s best, a status that could be jeopardized with an influx of commuters.)\n\nSchools are already struggling to stay under capacity, she said, could face greater challenges with the flood of 25,000 new employees \u2014 highlighting the core paradox of gentrification, in which the very perks that attracted new blood are also eroded by those residents\u2019 arrival.\n\nStretching behind a green construction wall, the parcel of land the company would take over is a mix of private and public land that had been marked for rezoning. (The private land is owned by Plaxall, a plastics company.) Sitting on an area known as the Anable Basin, it features prime waterfront space and dazzling views of the east side of Manhattan across the river.\n\nThere was little evidence Tuesday of the changes to come. Near the planned site sat an ungainly taxi garage, a bunkerlike building housing the New York Blood Center and a smattering of drab government offices. The Queensboro Bridge loomed in the background, not as the softly lit vista seen from Manhattan in untold romantic comedies but as a cantilevered hulk of steel, as though one was viewing a duck confit from its bony underside.\n\nYet at the southern end of the site, both the river and the last in the chain of current high-rises were on view, hinting at the gleaming tech future Amazon promises. It is a tableaux that could stretch all the way toward the Queensbridge Houses, the largest public-housing development in the Western Hemisphere that sits about a half-mile north and is one of the region\u2019s most blighted areas.\n\nIf cities are to be revamped for the future, some Long Island City residents said, it means accepting the changes and displacement that come with it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for the old to move out and new lives to come in,\u201d said 89-year-old Vincenzo Cerbone, who has owned Manducatis restaurant for nearly a half-century and lives right near the Anable Basin.\n\nSome other business owners were less optimistic.\n\nMichael Dhoman, who has run the Silver Star Auto Express repair shop a few blocks from the headquarters site, said he wanted badly to compete in an Amazonian future but has given hope that he can. \u201cMy landlord has said he will raise the rent from $9,000 to $15,000 a month when my lease is up next year,\u201d said Dhoman as he stood in his garage. \u201cI\u2019ve been here 12 years. I can\u2019t afford that.\u201d\n\nSome described a Catch-22 created by the new corporate import from Seattle.\n\n\u201cMore upper-middle class people means more customers,\u201d said Mull, the pharmacist. \u201cBut it also means higher rents and the need to raise prices.

(Laurent Cipriani/Associated Press)\n\nPARIS \u2014 French authorities say they have closed an investigation into the disappearance and subsequent detention in China of the former president of Interpol, and found no evidence to support his wife\u2019s claim that she got a threatening call in Chinese after he was picked up.\n\nGrace Meng, the wife of Meng Hongwei, detailed the threatening call in an Associated Press interview in October. She said the caller told her to only listen but not to speak and threatened: \u201cWe\u2019ve come in two work teams, two work teams just for you.\u201d\n\nAn official close to the French investigation said Wednesday that police in the city of Lyon, where Interpol is headquartered, closed their probe into the call and Meng\u2019s detention having found no evidence that a crime was committed in France.

At the other are so-called moderates, who know that with divided government, nothing will ever be enacted into law without compromise.\n\nSince Democrats' big victory on election night, Pelosi has talked up bipartisanship and seeking inroads with Republicans on issues such as infrastructure investments and preserving protections for Americans with preexisting conditions.\n\nThe progressive wing of the party isn\u2019t thrilled with her instinct to work with the Trump White House and Republicans after so many years of the GOP resisting any compromise with them.\n\nAnd they may have public opinion on their side.\n\nAs Americans' political views become more polarized, there\u2019s been a significant shift in the number of people who want to see compromise vs. wanting a candidate who will stand by their principles. For years, polls showed that a majority of voters valued compromise, but a Pew Research poll conducted in March found that \u201croughly half of Americans say they prefer politicians who stick to their positions (53 percent), while slightly fewer say they like those who make compromises with people they disagree with (44 percent).

At the other are so-called moderates, who know that with divided government, nothing will ever be enacted into law without compromise.\n\nSince Democrats' big victory on election night, Pelosi has talked up bipartisanship and seeking inroads with Republicans on issues such as infrastructure investments and preserving protections for Americans with preexisting conditions.\n\nThe progressive wing of the party isn\u2019t thrilled with her instinct to work with the Trump White House and Republicans after so many years of the GOP resisting any compromise with them.\n\nAnd they may have public opinion on their side.\n\nAs Americans' political views become more polarized, there\u2019s been a significant shift in the number of people who want to see compromise vs. wanting a candidate who will stand by their principles. For years, polls showed that a majority of voters valued compromise, but a Pew Research poll conducted in March found that \u201croughly half of Americans say they prefer politicians who stick to their positions (53 percent), while slightly fewer say they like those who make compromises with people they disagree with (44 percent). This represents a substantial shift from July 2017, when 58 percent of the public said they preferred politicians who compromised compared with 39 percent who said they liked politicians who stick with their positions.\u201d\n\nNotably, where Republicans have long valued ideological purity, increasingly, Democrats are as well.

Temporary protected status provides safe havens for people from countries experiencing armed conflicts, natural disasters and other challenges.\n\nLawyers for Civil Rights says in the lawsuit that Trump\u2019s move to rescind the program was rooted in animus against immigrants of color, citing comments he made on the campaign trial and in office.\n\n\u201cAccess to these videotapes will help further demonstrate that Defendant Trump holds racially biased views that impact his policy and decision making,\u201d attorney Oren Nimni said in a written statement. The subpoenas also seek any relevant outtakes, audio clips and transcripts made during production of the show.\n\nEmails seeking comment were sent to an MGM lawyer, a Trump Production official and White House officials.\n\nA federal judge in July denied Trump\u2019s request to throw out the lawsuit and rejected the administration\u2019s bid to remove Trump as a defendant in the case.\n\nIn a different case in California, another federal judge last month issued a temporary injunction that bars the Trump administration from ending the protections, saying there is evidence that president \u201charbors an animus against non-white, non-European aliens which influenced his ... decision to end the TPS designation.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration is appealing that ruling.\n\nPressure on producers of the \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d to release unaired footage of the show intensified during the 2016 presidential campaign after The Washington Post published a 2005 \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d recording of Trump boasting about aggressively groping women.\n\nMGM, which owns \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d said at the time that it couldn\u2019t unilaterally release any unaired, archived material because of contractual obligations. The show\u2019s producer, Mark Burnett, also said he didn\u2019t have the ability or right to release footage.\n\nA former contestant on \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d who has accused Trump of unwanted groping and kissing has also sought footage through a lawsuit against the president, but it\u2019s unclear whether she has received any.\n\nThe subpoena issued by Summer Zervos\u2019 attorney in May sought any \u201cApprentice\u201d material that features Zervos, or Trump talking about her or discussing other female contestants in a sexual or inappropriate way.\n\n____\n\nFollow Alanna Durkin Richer on Twitter at http://twitter.com/aedurkinricher .\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

She and four others from that small group now say the sense of intimacy, artistry and discovery that defined early Instagram and led to its success has given way to a celebrity-driven marketplace that is engineered to sap users\u2019 time and attention at the cost of their well-being.\n\n\u201cIn the early days, you felt your post was seen by people who cared about you and that you cared about,\u201d said Richardson, who left Instagram in 2014 and later founded a start-up. \u201cThat feeling is completely gone for me now.\u201d\n\n[From Silicon Valley elite to social media hate: The radicalization that led to Gab]\n\nThe catalyst for Richardson\u2019s decision to quit Instagram came when its co-founders, Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, unexpectedly announced that they were leaving the company. With their exit, Richardson and other former Instagram employees worried Facebook would squash whatever independent identity the company had managed to retain.\n\nShe sent her goodbye to Instagram the next day.\n\nEven in Silicon Valley, where it\u2019s common to hear start-up workers become frustrated with management after an acquisition, the disillusionment of the early Instagram employees is striking: People seldom swear off or criticize the product they built, particularly when it has enjoyed such remarkable success. Instagram reached 1 billion users this year.\n\nThe people who worked at social networks long saw the connection and free expression they facilitated as a powerful force for good and evidence of the contribution they were making to society. For them, the public questioning of the role social networks play in democracy and in individual lives, sparked by concerns over privacy and health, is deeply personal.\n\nThree of the early Instagram employees, including Richardson, have deleted it \u2014 permanently or periodically, comparing it to a drug that produces a diminishing high. One of the people said he felt a little embarrassed to tell people that he worked there. Two of the other early employees said they used it far less than before.\n\nThis shift is part of an existential crisis for Facebook, which has seen a slew of top executives resign this year, including the leaders of its major acquisitions: Oculus, WhatsApp and Instagram. Some people are also abandoning Facebook: It lost 4 million users in Europe in the last six months and growth has plateaued in the United States.\n\nThe Instagram employees, including Richardson, said they hoped their concerns would not be dismissed as nostalgia and would be seen as a call to future entrepreneurs to recognize these pitfalls and build something better.\n\n\u201cThere was so much pressure to do things that \u2018scaled,\u2019 to use the Silicon Valley buzzword,\u201d said Josh Riedel, the third employee after Systrom and Krieger. \u201cBut when you have over a billion users, something gets lost along the way.\u201d\n\nIan Spalter, Instagram\u2019s head of design, said in an interview that experiences on Instagram are subjective \u2014 one person\u2019s frustration may be another person\u2019s pleasure \u2014 and that the app was not designed to be a time-suck. \u201cWe\u2019re not in the game to have you leave Instagram feeling worse off than when you went in,\u201d he said.\n\nOne of the departed founders of a company Facebook acquired, WhatsApp\u2019s Brian Acton, has actively encouraged people to delete Facebook, though he is still a proponent and a user of WhatsApp. (He is also funding a rival messaging app.) Other former Facebook executives have expressed regrets about the products they built. Instagram\u2019s Systrom continues to champion the service but recently said of his departure: \u201cYou don\u2019t leave a job because everything is awesome, right?\u201d\n\nII.\n\nWhen Richardson joined Instagram in February 2012, at age 26, the former art history major was drawn to what was then a fast-growing indie platform for photographers, hipsters and artistic-types who wanted to share interesting or beautiful things they discovered about the world. At that time, Instagram was \u201ca camera that looked out into the world,\" said one of the company\u2019s first engineers, \"versus a camera that was all about myself, my friends, who I\u2019m with.\u201d\n\nRichardson ran the start-up\u2019s blog as well as the official @instagram account from the company\u2019s offices in San Francisco\u2019s South Park neighborhood. Before there were software algorithms suggesting accounts to follow, Richardson selected featured Instagrammers by hand. For the most devoted users, she organized in-person \u201cInsta-meets\u201d in places as far-flung as Moscow and North Korea.\n\n\u201cWe felt like stewards of that passion,\u201d Richardson said.\n\n\n\nRichardson moved to New York after leaving Instagram. (Yana Paskova/For The Washington Post)\n\nOne of the first people she featured prominently was an early Instagrammer in Spain. The exposure Richardson gave @IsabelitaVirtual, an amateur photographer whose real name is Isabel Martinez, helped Martinez become one of the most popular Instagram users in the country and led to a career in high-end fashion photography.\n\nBoth say that type of random connection that resulted in their friendship is hardly possible in the current iteration of Instagram. Too many people to follow, too much showmanship, too many posts flickering by, they say. \u201cI don\u2019t even see her posts anymore,\u201d Richardson said. Martinez told The Post that while she wouldn\u2019t quit Instagram for professional reasons, the app has in recent years become more anxiety-producing than pleasurable for her.\n\n[Facebook\u2019s former security chief warns of tech\u2019s \u2018negative impacts\u2019 \u2014 and has a plan to help solve them]\n\nEven in the early days, Richardson was aware that the app had a dark side. She was one of the first content moderators and spent many days and weekends culling through pornographic and other undesirable images that sprung up as the app grew.\n\nIII.\n\nA few months after Richardson started her job at Instagram, Systrom announced to the dozen employees that the company had been acquired by Facebook \u2014 taking everyone by surprise. The entire team got in a bus and drove about 30 miles south to Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park, where Facebook employees broke into applause as they entered the building. CEO Mark Zuckerberg took them into his office, where he welcomed them excitedly and assured them that they would maintain their own unique identity.\n\nRichardson said she was excited but apprehensive. The details of the acquisition were still murky. Ultimately only Systrom and Krieger walked away with hundreds of millions of dollars; Facebook offered other early employees small signing bonuses and limited Facebook stock grants for staying on. And Facebook had a reputation for alienating users with its privacy scandals, including charges it had settled with the Federal Trade Commission the previous year for sharing people\u2019s personal details that they thought were private with app developers and the public.\n\nA few months later, the team was officially installed in Menlo Park, where Instagram was given a separate area on campus to work.\n\nIts employees were seen as the cool kids on campus. They had figured out how to make a smartphone-only product go viral, something Facebook was still struggling to accomplish ahead of its impending public offering.\n\nBut there were things Facebook wanted to improve about Instagram. Facebook\u2019s growth team \u2014 an influential unit whose goal was to identify and implement measures to acquire users and keep them engaged \u2014 came in and picked apart every feature of the app, three of the former employees said.\n\nNo detail was too small. The team helped fix Instagram\u2019s clunky sign-in process, which was leaking users. It borrowed techniques that had worked on Facebook, like sending users an email alert about their friends\u2019 activities when they hadn\u2019t used the app in a while. They rolled out photo-tagging, much to the frustration of Instagram employees, who felt these features were too associated with Facebook and would fall flat with Instagram\u2019s user base, said four of the employees.\n\nThe photo-tagging feature triggered \u201cemotional anxiety,\u201d said the early engineer. \u201cIt introduced a whole new dynamic.\u201d\n\nRichardson\u2019s team of about six employees, which was focused on managing Instagram\u2019s most passionate power users, was also targeted for change. Facebook told them that in order for the product to scale to a large audience, software tools would need to replace manual processes, Richardson and two former employees said.\n\nRichardson said she was taken aback, \u201cnot because of the boldness of it or because of how crappy it made me and my contribution feel, but because of the misunderstanding of what we were trying to do.\u201d\n\nShe began making plans to leave and resigned in 2014, along with most of the employees The Post spoke with. By then, the app had more than 200 million users, compared with roughly 30 million at the time of the acquisition. Three of the original 13 employees are still at Instagram or Facebook, according to Facebook.\n\nInstagram moved to an algorithmic feed in 2016 \u2014 prior to that posts were in chronological order \u2014 and software is now doing much of the discovery on behalf of users, feeding them tailored content. The Stories feature, added the same year, introduced a flickering element to Instagram\u2019s design by automatically reloading new stories in a carousel. The result of these changes and others prior to it was increased follower counts, produced larger social networks with weaker ties, and more time spent in the app.\n\nRichardson, who is a big fan of hedgehogs, found herself looking at many more of them on Instagram. \u201cI clicked on one, but then I get dozens, which is more than my brain can possibly manage,\u201d she said. \u201cIt takes all the agency out of it.\u201d\n\n[A content moderator says she got PTSD while reviewing images posted on Facebook]\n\nSpalter, the Instagram design chief, pointed out that Instagram\u2019s rapid growth has required the company to build tools that will assist people in finding posts and users. \u201cWe have a billion people,\u201d he said. \u201cThat means we have content from every weird niche interest, and we have made it easier for you to find things. That\u2019s also the beauty of having a much larger community.\u201d\n\nInstagram is aware that its software was offering up too much celebrity content and content from people with large followings at the expense of posts from people who users know personally, according to Spalter, who joined Instagram in 2015. The company has rejiggered the software to adjust the balance, he said.\n\n\u201cManaging that balance is critical to Instagram\u2019s future. ... If you feed gets overrun with celebrities, you won\u2019t feel comfortable sharing content with your friends anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cI get how, in the early days, when you\u2019re connecting with everyone, that\u2019s very special. We\u2019re at a different phase of development at this point, and it\u2019s a different world in that way. But it\u2019s still a place where people connect.\u201d\n\nHe added that Instagram released tools in August to help people manage the time they spend on the app.\n\nRichardson says that content on Instagram is now \u201ctoo eager for your attention.\u201d Before, \u201cyou had to make an effort to find someone, and that meant something to you and to the people you found. Today I\u2019m amazed by how little honor each piece of content is given.\u201d\n\nAfter leaving Instagram, Richardson traveled around the world, meeting Instagram users whom she had connected with online. She eventually settled in New York City, where she founded a start-up called People & Company, where she helps nonprofits and businesses, including Nike, find ways to connect with their audiences online.\n\nShe says she wasn\u2019t thinking actively about Instagram until late September, when news broke that its founders were resigning \u2014 once again taking most of their employees by surprise.\n\nRichardson was flooded with memories. She remembered first meeting Martinez, and all that had changed since. She called up a friend from her Instagram days, and they concluded that Instagram no longer had value in their lives. Together, they decided to quit. She composed her last post while sitting in her car.\n\n\u201cIt feels like we\u2019re all addicted to a drug that doesn\u2019t get us high anymore,\u201d she said of the decision. \u201cSo I wanted to make space for something that really does.\u201d", "\n\nViola Davis in \u201cWidows.\u201d (Merrick Morton/Twentieth Century Fox)\n\nMovie critic\n\nRating:\n\nFrom its first moments, \u201cWidows\u201d signals that audiences aren\u2019t in for just another heist movie. We commence with a tender, deeply sensuous moment between Veronica Rawlins (Viola Davis) and her husband, Harry (Liam Neeson), drawing viewers into their vicarious pleasure and obvious love for each other. A smash cut later, we\u2019re in the midst of a chaotic crime scene, where a group of men in a van do desperate, bloody battle with the police who are chasing them, a confrontation that concludes with a shocking moment of explosive violence.\n\nDirector Steve McQueen toggles with cool, muscular confidence between these two diametrically opposed scenarios, assuring spectators that they\u2019re in exactly the right hands for the twisty, often graphically brutalizing journey to come. It turns out that Harry \u2014 a career criminal who lives in sleek splendor in a Mies van der Rohe building in Chicago \u2014 has been killed in that opening conflagration, which also vaporized the $5 million he and his accomplices stole. When Veronica \u2014 a union official \u2014 learns that Harry owed a portion of the loot to a local gangster turned politician, she flies into task-oriented action, recruiting the wives of Harry\u2019s henchmen to make one last big score.\n\n[Here are the 12 movies you should see this holiday season]\n\nAdapted by McQueen and novelist Gillian Flynn from a British television series, \u201cWidows\u201d faithfully obeys the most visceral beats of a classic caper flick, with none of the genre\u2019s playfulness or light-footed deviltry. Davis\u2019s Veronica is a somber, supremely focused manager who assembles a grimly efficient team of women who have been blindsided by the harsh truths their men left behind: Linda (Michelle Rodriguez) is on the verge of having her dress shop repossessed because of her late husband\u2019s gambling debts; Alice (Elizabeth Debicki) has been counseled \u2014 by her own mother \u2014 to exploit her statuesque beauty by joining a website matching wealthy men to attractive gold diggers.\n\nAs Veronica begins to suss out the myriad mysteries behind what Harry did for a living, and as she and the team plan and rehearse the Big Job, it becomes clear that McQueen doesn\u2019t intend for \u201cWidows\u201d to be merely a hard-edge version of \u201cOcean\u2019s 8.\u201d Instead, he pulls the lens back to contextualize the heist within the larger, labyrinthine, pervasively corrupt world of Chicago itself, where the women\u2019s enterprise brings them in contact not just with Jamal Manning (Brian Tyree Henry), a crime boss now running for alderman, but with Jack Mulligan (Colin Farrell), whose father, Tom (Robert Duvall), long ago secured that seat for the family and has no intention of seeing it ceded to immigrants or \u201cpeople who can\u2019t stop having babies.\u201d\n\nMillennial-adjacent and hip to 21st-century optics, Jack makes sure to inoculate himself as a white man by concocting a self-serving (and self-enriching) publicity stunt involving a minority-women-owned work initiative. Exposing the cynical use of women of color as props is just one canny way that \u201cWidows\u201d threads real-world issues of race, class and gender throughout a narrative in which the protagonists are constantly tethered to a world where child care is an issue even for would-be criminal masterminds, where the question of where to buy a Glock is answered with a matter-of-fact \u201cThis is America\u201d and where, as a preacher intones at one point, \u201cignorance is the new excellence.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also a world of hairdressers, receptionists and other female spaces that might be invisible to male eyes, but house vast stores of subversive power. When Belle (Cynthia Erivo) joins Veronica\u2019s no-nonsense sisterhood as a driver, she\u2019s fitting it in with other gigs as a stylist and babysitter, leaving her own kids at home while she runs any hustle she can to get by. Every scene of \u201cWidows\u201d carries with it a sharp-eyed commentary on American life, from its cultural love of violence to its vastly unequal economic system, from its nominal embrace of pluralism to its Darwinian politics. The movie is punctuated by moments of pitiless, horrifying savagery, and one genuinely breathtaking plot twist. But its most memorable quality is the clear-eyed, compassionate honesty with which it depicts the wearying workaday world of navigating structures and interpersonal dynamics inimical to one\u2019s health, safety and very being.\n\nWorking with his longtime cinematographer Sean Bobbitt, McQueen photographs \u201cWidows\u201d with handsome austerity, favoring clean, hard surfaces that literally and figuratively reflect the film\u2019s brittle tone. And he has cast his movie brilliantly, most notably with Davis, Debicki, Rodriguez and Erivo, whose businesslike chemistry belies the sentimentalized brand of sisterhood that Hollywood likes to sell as feel-good feminism. In an equally outstanding supporting cast, Henry, Farrell and Duvall are joined by Lukas Haas, Jacki Weaver and Daniel Kaluuya in the most chilling turn of his career.\n\nWhen it comes to the climactic sequence, \u201cWidows\u201d succumbs to one or two lapses in logic; or maybe it moves so swiftly that viewers may not catch every nuance. Still, it proves how smarts and style can elevate even the pulpiest material into something shrewd, socially attuned and bracingly observant. Rarely has a movie been so illuminated by a single character simply breaking into a smile, and rarely has a smile been so unequivocally earned.", "\n\nTroy Aikman is feeling sunnier about Dallas.

He said it on the radio and everything.\n\n\u201cI would probably put it on Dallas, in all honesty,\u201d Aikman replied when asked which team he\u2019d put a dollar on to win the division.\n\n\u201cI think that win at Philadelphia certainly positioned them very well,\u201d Aikman said during his weekly KTCK-FM 96.7 The Ticket radio appearance (via the Dallas Morning News). \u201cWashington was able to win; Tampa Bay had over 500 yards of offense against them and they still win, that\u2019s unheard of. The next week or so will be interesting to see what happens and whether or not Washington is able to extend their lead with Dallas going to Atlanta. I think that\u2019s going to be a really tough ballgame with Atlanta coming off a difficult loss, but they are capable of scoring points.\u201d\n\nYes, these are the same Cowboys who lost Nov. 5 to the Tennessee Titans in a performance that triggered Aikman\u2019s brutal assessment. The Redskins, 6-3 after their ugly victory over Tampa Bay, face the Houston Texans on Sunday, then play the Cowboys on Thanksgiving Day. Which means that, perhaps, the division is there for the taking after all.\n\n\u201cThe Thanksgiving game is huge. If Dallas can keep it within two games going into Thanksgiving and win that game, I think they\u2019re positioned pretty well,\u201d Aikman said. \u201cThe fact that they\u2019ve got Philadelphia now at home bodes well for the Cowboys as well. Right now if I had to pick someone, I\u2019d pick Dallas.\u201d\n\nThe Redskins defense has been solid most of the season, but it gave up those 501 yards \u2014 but just three points \u2014 to the Buccaneers. Aikman pointed out that Washington has been decimated by injuries, especially to the offensive line.\n\n[What Le\u2019Veon Bell\u2019s decision to sit out the season means for him and for the Steelers]\n\n\u201cI think the defense for Dallas is going to have to continue to have the type of game like they had the other night,\u201d Aikman said, referring to Sunday\u2019s Eagles game. \u201cBut I just think Washington is so beat up. How they\u2019re doing it is pretty remarkable. I think Jay Gruden has done a really good job considering what all they have lost.\"\n\nAikman didn\u2019t spare owner Jerry Jones when it came to his criticism last week, and he still differs with Jones on how to handle the future of quarterback Dak Prescott. Unlike Jones, Aikman would bide his time.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a big Dak Prescott fan, was really happy for him to come out and respond the way he did [against the Eagles],\u201d Aikman said. \u201cIf you do invest that money in him, you know what you\u2019re going to get. With Dak, I know he\u2019ll be even more committed to being great and helping the team win a championship. . . . I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to pay him, but [the] longer you can hold off to be certain of evaluations, I don\u2019t see anything wrong with that either.\n\nThat, too, could depend on how the rest of the season shakes out. Here\u2019s how the post-Thanksgiving stretch run looks for both the Cowboys and Redskins:\n\nCowboys: Saints at Dallas on Nov. 29, Eagles at Dallas on Dec. 9, Dallas at Colts on Dec. 16, Buccaneers at Dallas on Dec. 23, Dallas at Giants on Dec. 30.\n\nRedskins: Washington at Eagles on Dec. 3, Giants at Washington on Dec. 9, Washington at Jaguars on Dec. 16, Washington at Titans on Dec. 22 and Eagles at Washington on Dec. 30.\n\nWith apologies to Aikman, we\u2019ll note that the Eagles are 4-5, too. Here\u2019s how the rest of the season shapes up for them:\n\nEagles: Philadelphia at Saints on Sunday, Giants at Philadelphia on Nov. 25, Redskins at Philadelphia on Dec. 3, Philadelphia at Cowboys on Dec. 9, Philadelphia at Rams on Dec. 16, Texans at Philadelphia on Dec. 23 and Philadelphia at Redskins on Dec. 30.\n\nRead more from The Post:\n\nMarco Rubio roasted for \u20183 pt kick\u2019 tweet about Florida election\n\nBoswell: Josh Norman doesn\u2019t know Redskins history\n\nNFL moves Rams-Chiefs game from Mexico City to Los Angeles, citing poor field conditions\n\nFour years after leaving Texans, D.J.

Generally, subpoenas can imply that regulators did not receive all the information they wanted from initial cooperation with a company, he said.\n\nSnap began trading on the stock market in March 2017. According to the company\u2019s S-1 filing, Snap said it competes \u201cwith other companies in every aspect of our business\u201d and noted that Instagram\u2019s stories feature \u201clargely mimics our Stories feature and may be directly competitive.\u201d Snap told The Post that it believes the claims in the class-action lawsuit are \u201cmeritless\u201d and that \u201cour IPO disclosures were accurate and complete.\u201d Snap also said it has responded to the subpoenas and requests for information from the SEC and Justice Department and would continue to cooperate with the federal agencies.\n\nThe Justice Department declined to comment. The SEC did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nShareholders in the lawsuit allege, in part, that Snap concealed crucial information in the run-up to its IPO, failing to reveal how competition from Instagram was eating away at its user growth at the end of 2016, according to Bloomberg. The investors also alleged that Snap misrepresented its reliance on practices that boost daily user-counts, known as \u201cgrowth hacking,\u201d according to the report.\n\nMultiple attorneys representing the investors did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nDuring afternoon trading, Snap was down nearly 3 percent, at $6.51, well below its IPO price of $17.", "UNITED NATIONS \u2014 The U.N. Security Council voted unanimously Wednesday to lift sanctions against Eritrea following its thaw in relations with Ethiopia and other neighboring countries \u2014 but it kept an arms embargo on Somalia and a ban on trade in charcoal, a key source of funds for al-Shabab militants.\n\nThe resolution approved by the U.N.\u2019s most powerful body commended \u201cefforts toward peace, stability and reconciliation in the region\u201d sparked by Ethiopia\u2019s reformist prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, who came to power in April and accepted an international commission\u2019s border decision that favored Eritrea.\n\nEthiopia is the regional power and actions by the country\u2019s leader set off several diplomatic thaws, including one between Eritrea and Somalia. Leaders of Djibouti and Eritrea, which also had a turbulent relationship after multiple border clashes, met with the help of Ethiopia, though there has been no breakthrough.\n\nAhmed\u2019s office said after the vote that the lifting of sanctions will have far-reaching effects in improving stability and building lasting peace and normal relations in the Horn of Africa region.\n\n\u201cIt will further enhance the collaborative gains that have been achieved in the region over the past few months,\u201d the Ethiopian prime minister\u2019s office said.\n\nEritrea, a former Italian colony, gained independence from Ethiopia in 1993 after a 30-year guerrilla war. It had a decades-long border dispute with Ethiopia, including a war from 1998-2000 in which about 80,000 people died.\n\nThe Security Council imposed an arms embargo and other tough sanctions on Eritrea in 2009 for supplying weapons to Somalia\u2019s Islamic extremist al-Shabab rebels, who are opposed to the Somali government, and for refusing to resolve a border dispute with Djibouti, a key U.S. ally in the Horn of Africa.\n\nEritrea\u2019s Charge d\u2019Affaires Amanuel Giorgio called the sanctions \u201cunwarranted punitive measures\u201d and told the council after the vote that \u201cthe long overdue call for justice is finally answered.\u201d\n\nHe congratulated the people of Eritrea \u201con this historic day,\u201d and stressed that \u201cEritreans are extremely joyous and full of pride to have witnessed the recent positive regional developments ... (that) mark the beginning of a new dawn.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile proud of the region\u2019s capability to resolve intransigent conflicts at unprecedented speed, we are not complacent,\u201d Giorgio said. \u201cEritrea recognizes that a more difficult and complex task is waiting ahead. It is determined to redouble its own efforts and work closely with its neighbors to build a region at peace with itself.\u201d\n\nThe resolution immediately lifts \u201cthe arms embargoes, travel bans, asset freezes and targeted sanctions imposed on Eritrea by the Security Council.\u201d\n\nBut the Netherlands\u2019 ambassador, Karel van Oosterom, stressed that other demands by the council including that Eritrea \u201cshall cease using illicit means to collect taxes outside of Eritrea\u201d remain valid. The Netherlands has said extortion and threats of force against its large Eritrean diaspora is a sensitive issue that is high on the country\u2019s political agenda.\n\nThe resolution urges Eritrea and Djibouti \u201cto continue efforts to settle their border dispute peacefully ... by conciliation, arbitration or judicial settlement, or by any other means of pacific dispute settlement\u201d in the U.N. Charter. And it urges the two countries to engage on the issue of combatants from Djibouti missing in action.\n\nThe Security Council said, \u201cit will continue to follow developments towards the normalization of relations between Eritrea and Djibouti.\u201d\n\nDjibouti\u2019s U.N.

We need to expedite the process!\u201d Doualeh said.\n\nAs for Somalia, the resolution condemns continuing attacks by al-Shabab in the country and beyond and expresses concern at the presence of affiliates of the Islamic State extremist group \u201cand the security implications of the situation in Yemen for Somalia.\u201d\n\nIt commends efforts by Somalia\u2019s federal government to restore key economic and financial institutions and implement anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism measures. But it expresses concern at continued reports of corruption and diversion of public resources, including reports of \u201calleged financial impropriety\u201d involving members of the government, parliament and opposition.\n\nThe resolution extends both the arms embargo on Somalia and the ban on the import and export of Somali charcoal until Nov. 15, 2019, as the council expressed concern that the charcoal trade is providing \u201csignificant funding for al-Shabab.\u201d\n\nIt condemns al-Shabab\u2019s \u201cincreased revenue from natural resources including the taxing of the illicit sugar trade, agricultural production and livestock\u201d and its involvement in the illicit charcoal trade.\n\nSomalia\u2019s U.N. Ambassador Abukar Dahir Osman said the government \u201clooks forward to the beginning of a new chapter of cooperation and partnership with all the countries in the Horn of Africa\u201d \u2014 and wants sanctions lifted.\n\nHe urged the Security Council to establish \u201cclearly defined benchmarks\u201d for ending sanctions.\n\nOsman said the government also calls for sanctions to target al-Shabab, which continues to receive weapons and resources from abroad.\n\nAnd he asked why the council hasn\u2019t taken action against construction of a naval base in Berbera in Somalia\u2019s breakaway northern region of Somaliland which he called \u201ca clear violation of the arms embargo.\u201d Somaliland has an agreement with the United Arab Emirates to build a base at the port of Berbera.\n\n___\n\nElias Meseret contributed to this report from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

There was still plenty of time to tweet and watch Fox News Channel, but he also signed legislation, gave speeches, addressed policy issues and received his daily intelligence briefing.\n\nExclude the trip to France over the weekend (and that aborted excursion to the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery), and Trump\u2019s schedule since that frenetic pre-election Monday has included:\n\nTwo intelligence briefings\n\nTwo meetings (both with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo)\n\nOne ceremony (celebrating Diwali)\n\nOne news conference\n\nOne event (the investiture of Brett M. Kavanaugh at the Supreme Court)\n\nOver the course of eight days.\n\nThose last two events, one could argue, were ones that allowed Trump some sliver of that pre-election joy. Kavanaugh was a political success for the president, both in terms of the confirmation vote in the Senate and in terms of motivating his base. The news conference gave Trump an opportunity to spin the results of the election, however unsuccessfully.\n\nAs of writing on Wednesday morning, Trump hasn\u2019t even tweeted in nearly 18 hours. That\u2019s not a record, but there are few better signs of Trump having withdrawn from the world \u2014 at least temporarily.", "MOSCOW \u2014 More than 250 airline passengers who endured an unexpected three-day layover in Russia\u2019s Siberia region have finally made it to their destination in China.\n\nThe extended travel delay began Sunday when an Air France flight from Paris to Shanghai made an emergency landing in the eastern Siberia city of Irkutsk after smoke appeared in the cockpit.\n\nThe 264 passengers and 18 crew members were taken to hotels, but many weren\u2019t dressed for the minus-15 degrees Celsius (5 F) weather.

A certain amount of controlled chaos is inevitable. But there\u2019s ordinary White House chaos, and then there\u2019s Trump White House chaos.\n\nNew reporting paints a picture of the administration descending into a thunderdome of backstabbing and resentment as staffers jockey for position or wonder whether they should get the heck out, all presided over by an erratic, unhappy president. This might sound like a familiar story, but if it isn\u2019t already worse than it has been before, it soon will be, especially now that the midterm elections have cast a cloud over the remaining two years of President Trump\u2019s term.\n\nLet\u2019s run down a few of the highlights:\n\nTrump\u2019s trip to France to mark the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I was a disaster, marked by a brooding and petulant president mocked and condemned wherever he went. Angry about his party\u2019s midterm losses, Trump has spent his time in the past week insulting reporters in terms that are unusually personal even for him, spinning out desperate conspiracy theories about stolen elections on Twitter and lashing out at Theresa May and Emmanuel Macron.\n\nAfter deciding not to attend a ceremony honoring those killed in the war because rain apparently made it inconvenient to get there, Trump grew enraged at his staff \u201cfor not counseling him that skipping the cemetery visit would be a public-relations nightmare.\u201d Somehow he was not able to figure out for himself that doing so might not go over well.\n\nTrump \u201ctold advisers over the weekend that he had decided to remove Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and that he also was seriously considering replacing White House chief of staff John F. Kelly.\u201d\n\nWhile Trump is considering replacing Kelly with Nick Ayers, Vice President Pence\u2019s chief of staff, \u201caides told Trump that appointing Ayers would lower staff morale and perhaps trigger an exodus.\u201d\n\nFirst lady Melania Trump\u2019s staff issued an extraordinary statement saying a top national security aide, Mira R. Ricardel, \u201cno longer deserves the honor of serving in this White House,\u201d making public a bureaucratic feud that stretches between the White House and the Pentagon.\n\nAccording to the Los Angeles Times, \u201cWith the certainty that the incoming Democratic House majority will go after his tax returns and investigate his actions, and the likelihood of additional indictments by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, Trump has retreated into a cocoon of bitterness and resentment.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s firing of Jeff Sessions and appointment of Matthew Whitaker as acting attorney general, a move meant to protect him from the Mueller investigation, is turning out to be a mini-scandal in its own right, to the point where the president vacillates between singing Whitaker\u2019s praises and claiming he doesn\u2019t know him.\n\nThe root of all this is the midterm elections, and it\u2019s hard to overstate what an impact they\u2019ll have on the administration. Nobody likes losing, of course, but nobody hates it more than Trump, particularly after he worked so hard in the weeks leading up to the election, telling his supporters that \u201cI\u2019m not on the ticket, but I am on the ticket, because this is also a referendum about me.\u201d It was indeed, and he was pretty emphatically rejected.\n\nNothing is more upsetting to Trump than being considered a loser, even temporarily. But I suspect that the prospect of having his tax returns made public has him even more frightened. We don\u2019t know what they will reveal, but suffice to say that no sane person believes that all we\u2019ll discover when they\u2019re opened up is that Trump took advantage of some loopholes and did some creative accounting here and there. Everything we know about Trump\u2019s career \u2014 not least the recent revelation that he and his family engaged in a years-long conspiracy to commit tax fraud on an absolutely massive scale \u2014 suggests that those returns will be a Pandora\u2019s box of scandal.\n\nSo that would account for the president\u2019s dark mood. But if you\u2019re one of his staffers, you\u2019re probably gripped by an equally strong sense of foreboding, or at a minimum the feeling that the fun times are over. Not only won\u2019t there be any more conservative legislation to pass, but also Democrats will be launching one investigation after another, probing everything you\u2019ve done for the past two years. If you\u2019re senior enough, you may get hauled before House committees to be grilled mercilessly. You might even need to get yourself a lawyer, which can be a real burden on a government salary.\n\nSo you go to work every day wondering when the hammer is going to fall on you. Is one of your colleagues plotting against you? Are you going to get a congressional subpoena? Is today the day that the president turns his wrath on you in his endless search for others to blame for his problems and his mistakes?\n\nWhen everyone around you feels that way, too, things get a little uneasy. Describing the White House right now, one former Trump aide told Politico, \u201cIt\u2019s like an episode of \u2018Maury,'\u201d referencing the daytime TV show famous for bitter family arguments. \u201cThe only thing that\u2019s missing is a paternity test.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s no mystery about who the father of this mess is. He\u2019s sitting in the Oval Office, scared and angry that the accountability he has outrun his entire life might actually catch up to him.\n\nRead more:\n\nTrump\u2019s xenophobic fearmongering backfired in 2018.

Ten Democratic incumbents sought reelection in states Donald Trump won in 2016. Six won, while one race \u2014 Florida \u2014 remains unresolved.\n\nThis is a developing story. It will be updated.", "\n\nPresident Trump at the White House on Tuesday. (Joshua Roberts/Bloomberg)\n\nOpinion writer\n\nThe Post reports:\n\nDuring his 43-hour stay in Paris, [President] Trump brooded over the Florida recount and sulked over other key races being called for Democrats in the midterm elections that he had claimed as a \u201cbig victory.\u201d He erupted at his staff over media coverage of his decision to skip a ceremony honoring the military sacrifice of World War I. The president also was angry and resentful over French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s public rebuke of rising nationalism, which Trump considered a personal attack. And that was after his difficult meeting with Macron, where officials said little progress was made as Trump again brought up his frustrations over trade and Iran.\n\nTrump hollered at British Prime Minister Theresa May in a phone call, berated aides and insisted on personnel changes likely to worsen morale in an already besieged White House. It is this ongoing funk that may explain his baseless attacks on the voting recount in Florida and his lashing out at CNN reporter Abby Phillip. (\u201cTrump sent political aides in Washington scrambling to prepare detailed briefings for him on the still-to-be-called races. He aired baseless allegations of voter irregularities on Twitter. . . . Still, the president told aides he felt disconnected from the action in his suite at the U.S. ambassador\u2019s residence in Paris \u2014 even as he consumed countless hours of television news on the trip.\u201d)\n\nIn other words, as bad a Trump\u2019s public outbursts may be, he is even less composed, rational and stable behind closed doors. Once more \u2014 as we saw with Bob Woodward\u2019s book, the anonymous op-ed in the New York Times, Michael Wolff\u2019s book, Omarosa Manigault Newman\u2019s tell-all, and countless news reports \u2014 the people who work most closely with Trump know best how emotionally, intellectually and temperamentally unfit he is for the job. And yet, they continue to mislead the public, and remain silent after leaving, as to the president\u2019s ability to carry out his duties.\n\nTrump apologists, as they habitually do, will deny and disbelieve reporting. But foreign leaders, outside friends, members of Congress and others who observe him on a daily basis now spill their guts to the media, perhaps to distance themselves from the White House\u2019s downward spiral.\n\nThere are several takeaways from all of this.\n\nFirst, Trump will get worse under pressure. If he is this bad now, imagine what he\u2019ll be like if more associates are indicted, the economy goes to seed or the subpoenas start flying. At some point, unless Trump has him fired, special counsel Robert S. Mueller III will issue his report. Unless it miraculously exonerates him, the president may have a meltdown that will make his trip to France look like a picnic.\n\nSecond, self-described saviors of the country, such as the anonymous op-ed writer, are deluding themselves if they believe they are preventing the president from harming the country. Daily, he threatens democratic norms, blemishes the United States\u2019 reputation around the world and makes worse and worse personnel decisions in an effort to surround himself with more compliant aides. If Trump fires Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly, it is not clear how many more erratic decisions will be made or how serious the ramifications may be.\n\nThird, all of this points to the gross irresponsibility of Republicans who, for two years, refused to exercise any oversight and continue to spin on his behalf. They would rather excuse the conduct of an unbalanced and hysterical commander in chief then move to limit his powers (e.g., reassert that a first strike is an act of war requiring congressional authorization, claw back power to enact tariffs). They likely will continue to rubber-stamp his executive branch picks, no matter how unprepared and temperamentally unfit they may be. Even more reprehensible, they will heartily endorse him for reelection while maligning his challengers. Maybe if they see control of the Senate slipping away, they will finally cut him loose.\n\nAll of this reminds us that Democratic control of the House is only a halfway measure. Unless and until Trump is out of office, the country, our democracy and our security remain at risk.\n\nRead more:\n\nWhat\u2019s a defeated or retired Republican to do?\n\nTrump\u2019s era of hate\n\nThe Republican Party has a woman problem\n\nThe world is moving on from Trump.

(Jacques Demarthon/AP)\n\nPARIS \u2014 Responding to President Trump\u2019s attacks on his French counterpart, France\u2019s government struck back Wednesday, accusing Trump of lacking \u201ccommon decency\u201d by spewing invective on the same day the country was commemorating the victims of a major 2015 terrorist attack.\n\nBenjamin Griveaux, France\u2019s government spokesman, offered the response a day after Trump unleashed a string of Twitter attacks on President Emmanuel Macron.\n\n\u201cYesterday was November 13,\u201d Griveaux said, according to the minutes of a meeting of France\u2019s Council of Ministers \u2014 remarks that were widely reported in French media. \u201cWe were commemorating the murder of 130 of our people.\u201d\n\nThe Nov. 13, 2015, attacks, perpetrated by a network of Islamic State-affiliated gunmen on a number of sites across the French capital, including the Bataclan concert hall, were the bloodiest on French soil since World War II.\n\n\u201cSo I\u2019ll reply in English: \u2018Common decency\u2019 would have been appropriate,\u201d Griveaux said.\n\nOn Tuesday \u2014 two days after flying home from a two-day visit to France \u2014 Trump took to Twitter to post multiple blistering attacks on Macron, France\u2019s performance in both world wars and France in general.\n\nHe was responding in part to an address Macron gave Sunday in Paris, where the French president used the 100th anniversary of the 1918 World War I armistice to condemn nationalism as the \u201cexact opposite of patriotism.\u201d The remarks were seen by many as a direct challenge to Trump, who has openly identified himself as a nationalist.\n\nIn his Tuesday tweets, Trump personally criticized Macron, who had previously sought to curry favor with Washington.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that Emmanuel suffers from a very low Approval Rating in France, 26%, and an unemployment rate of almost 10%,\u201d Trump wrote, attempting to explain Macron\u2019s remarks. The French unemployment rate is actually closer to 9 percent.\n\nThis, for Trump, was the reason Macron defended multilateralism beneath the Arc de Triomphe in a solemn remembrance ceremony: \u201cHe was just trying to get onto another subject.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy the way, there is no country more Nationalist than France,\u201d Trump noted, \u201cvery proud people-and rightfully so!........\u201d\n\nMacron addressed the tensions with Trump in a wide-ranging interview on French television Wednesday night, conducted aboard an aircraft carrier.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to respond to tweets,\u201d he told a journalist from France\u2019s TF1 network, in what was ultimately a response to a tweet.\n\nThe French president then underscored the historic alliance between the two countries but insisted that France and Europe should not be subservient to the United States in matters of defense and security.\n\nMacron repeated his earlier remark \u2014 which had so angered Trump \u2014 on the need for Europe to take charge of its own security instead of relying exclusively on the United States. In another interview last week, Macron said he believed in the need for a \u201ctrue European army.\u201d\n\nBut because of a probable translation error in a number of English-language reports, Trump and his aides believed Macron was advocating a European army to defend the continent against the United States. \u201cVery insulting,\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter, as Air Force One arrived in Paris on Friday.\n\n\u201cCan I, as president, say to you: I want to place all your security in the hands of the United States?\u201d Macron asked in Wednesday interview. \u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe United States is our historic ally, but to be an ally is not to be a vassal,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should not depend on them.\u201d", "The Justice Department released a memorandum Wednesday defending the legality of President Trump\u2019s appointment of Matthew G. Whitaker as acting attorney general, rejecting criticism from some lawyers that the move violates the Constitution.\n\nSince the announcement last week, some have charged that Whitaker, who served as the chief of staff to the previous attorney general, Jeff Sessions, is ineligible to serve as head of the Justice Department because he is not a Senate-confirmed official.\n\n[Read the Justice Department memo about the Whitaker appointment]\n\nOn Tuesday, Maryland Attorney General Brian E. Frosh, a Democrat, asked a federal judge to block Whitaker\u2019s appointment, arguing that Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein should instead take on the role.\n\nThe Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel, which provides legal guidance to the federal government, said in a 20-page memo that past practice, court rulings and legal analysis show the Whitaker appointment is legal. In particular, it says the scenario is expressly authorized by the 1998 Federal Vacancies Reform Act.\n\nThe memo also notes that before Sessions was forced out of the job, the White House had sought advice from the OLC and was told that Whitaker could be appointed.\n\n\u201cAs all three branches of government have long recognized, the president may designate an acting official to perform the duties of a vacant principal office, including a Cabinet office, even when the acting official has not been confirmed by the Senate,\u201d the memo said.\n\nThe memo notes that Trump has now done it six times, while President Barack Obama did it twice and that President George W. Bush did it once.\n\nInterestingly, the legal opinion also concludes that even if Trump had fired Sessions, he could have replaced him with a non-Senate-confirmed government employee for a period of up to seven months, or more if a nomination was pending. By that reasoning, the president has the power to remove Cabinet-level officials at will and put their replacements in charge of major government branches for half a year or more.\n\n[Maryland challenges legality of Whitaker appointment as attorney general]\n\nCritics of the Whitaker selection have argued that the Federal Vacancies Reform Act should not take precedence over other statutes and the Constitution\u2019s formula for replacing senior government officials.\n\nTrump tapped Whitaker to serve as acting attorney general last week after Sessions resigned at the president\u2019s request. Whitaker\u2019s elevation has raised concerns about his qualifications, his past statements as a U.S. Senate candidate and his business practices.\n\nThe OLC\u2019s legal analysis of the practice found 160 such instances \u2014 all of them occurring before 1860 \u2014 in which a non-Senate-confirmed official became the acting head of an agency. In 1866, a non-Senate-confirmed assistant attorney general served as an acting attorney general, according to the memo signed by Assistant Attorney General Steven A. Engel.\n\nConcerns about Whitaker\u2019s appointment stem partly from unanswered questions about what, if anything, the new acting attorney general may do to try to steer the ongoing probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election. The investigation has also focused on whether any Trump associates conspired with Russia to interfere with the election.\n\n[Flake refuses to vote for Trump\u2019s judicial nominees until the Senate acts on bill to protect Mueller]\n\nThat probe, led by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, has been supervised by Rosenstein, the No. 2 Justice Department official, because Sessions had recused himself from the case when he was attorney general.\n\nWhitaker, according to people close to him, has no intention of recusing himself from the Russia probe, although Justice Department officials have said he will follow normal department procedures for any possible ethics issues.\n\nConcerns about the Russia probe\u2019s independence have prompted renewed efforts in Congress to pass legislation that would prevent Mueller from being fired without good cause.\n\nOn Wednesday, Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) said he would not vote for any judicial nominations until Senate leaders allowed a floor vote on legislation he is pushing that would bar the administration from firing Mueller without good cause.\n\nFlake\u2019s position could prevent confirmation of any judges until a new congressional session begins in January, when he will leave the Senate.", "House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) is trying to shore up support for the speakership. (J. Scott Applewhite/AP)\n\nWith last week\u2019s midterms largely in the rearview mirror, leadership elections are the order of the day on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn morning meetings, both Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) won the votes to keep their posts next year.\n\nHouse Republicans \u2014 who will become the minority party in that chamber in January \u2014 picked Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) as their leader. He fended off a conservative challenge from Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio).\n\nHouse Democrats are not picking leaders until later this month but could have the most interesting day of all, as House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) seeks to corral the support she would need to become speaker amid speculation that she lacks the votes.\n\n2:05 p.m.: Cheney selected for No. 3 GOP leadership post in House\n\nRep. Liz Cheney (Wyo.) was chosen by her Republican colleagues Wednesday to serve as House Republican conference chair, the No. 3 GOP spot in the House.\n\nCheney, who first won election in 2016, is the daughter of former vice president Richard B. Cheney.\n\nShe launched her bid for the post last Wednesday with a letter to colleagues in which she criticized Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.), who has held the position for three terms. McMorris Rodgers announced the next day that she was stepping aside from her leadership role and instead seeking to climb the ranks of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.\n\nThe elder Cheney, who served as GOP conference chair from 1987 to 1989, was present for Wednesday\u2019s vote for his daughter.\n\n1:55 p.m.: McCarthy elected minority leader; Scalise becomes minority whip\n\nMcCarthy ascended to the top job in House Republican leadership Wednesday, turning back a challenge from Jordan, a leader of the conservative House Freedom Caucus.\n\nMcCarthy prevailed 159-43, according to the House press gallery.\n\nWith Republicans losing the House last week, the two were vying to become minority leader to replace the retiring Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.).\n\nThe No. 2 spot of House minority whip was claimed by Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.), who serves in the third-ranking role in House GOP leadership. Scalise had mulled a bid against McCarthy but announced last week that he was pursuing the minority whip spot instead.\n\nMcCarthy, the current House majority leader, made a bid for speaker in 2015 but stepped aside amid pressure from conservatives. With Ryan\u2019s backing \u2014 as well as a close relationship with President Trump \u2014 McCarthy prevailed over Jordan.\n\nThe California Republican has leveraged his alliance with Trump to his advantage on Capitol Hill, where the president looms large over the House GOP conference.\n\nTrump has referred to McCarthy as \u201cmy Kevin\u201d since before his inauguration, and McCarthy has at times gone to great lengths to curry favor with Trump, both through legislation \u2014 such as by introducing a bill that would appropriate more than $23 billion to Trump\u2019s border wall plan \u2014 and other means, such as sending the president his favorite candies.\n\n1:15 p.m.: Pelosi touts support of NARAL Pro-Choice America\n\nIn her bid to become speaker, Pelosi on Wednesday touted the support of a leading abortion rights group, NARAL Pro-Choice America.\n\nIn a statement shared by Pelosi\u2019s office, the House minority leader was widely praised by the group\u2019s president, Ilyse Hogue.\n\n\u201cShe is a true champion for women and families and will stand up to Donald Trump and the Republicans\u2019 relentless attacks on our rights and freedoms,\u201d Hogue said. \u201cNow more than ever, we need strong leaders who will fight passionately to defend and proactively expand our rights. That\u2019s Nancy Pelosi.\u201d\n\nAs Pelosi seeks to round up needed votes, she has run into resistance from some of her female colleagues, particularly those newer to the House.\n\n1:05 p.m.: Ryan says it\u2019s time to talk about a replacement for Pelosi\n\nRep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), who unsuccessfully challenged Pelosi for a leadership position two years ago, said Wednesday that opposition to her speakership bid is strong enough for Democrats to start talking about who is going to replace her.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talent out there. A lot of them don\u2019t want to step forward,\u201d Ryan said, referring to other potential candidates for House speaker. \u201cThis is obviously not an easy thing to do to take on the leadership. But once we get to the point we know we\u2019re going to have new leadership, I think a lot of people will emerge to run.\u201d\n\n12:45 p.m.: House Democrats offer varying rationales on speaker vote\n\nHouse Democrats are offering divergent views about whether Pelosi is best-suited to take over the speaker\u2019s gavel when the party takes control of the chamber in January.\n\nRep. Ro Khanna (Calif) argued that denying the job to a woman would be problematic.\n\n\u201cI think the fact that we have won the House majority because of women candidates with huge women turnout, to then deny the first woman speaker who led us to that victory the gavel, I think would be a slap in the face of a lot of voters who sent us here,\u201d Khanna said.\n\nMeanwhile, Rep.-elect Mikie Sherrill (N.J.) said she plans to stick by a promise made to voters in her district not to support Pelosi for speaker.\n\n\u201cI made a commitment to my district that I would not be supporting Nancy Pelosi,\u201d Sherrill said. \u201cI think there are some great people that will be coming forward, and I\u2019m excited to see who those people might be. They haven\u2019t identified themselves yet, but we have such a deep bench of talent in the Democratic Party. So I\u2019m excited to see what comes next.\u201d\n\n11:55 a.m.: Pelosi touts growing labor union support\n\nIn her bid to become House speaker, Pelosi on Wednesday highlighted a growing number of endorsements from labor groups, including the Service Employees International Union, which spent heavily to help elect Democrats to Congress this year.\n\nPelosi\u2019s office released a letter from SEIU President Mary Kay Henry saying the minority leader had demonstrated her support for the union\u2019s key issues, including increasing the minimum wage and improving Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nPelosi on Wednesday also won the support of the United Steelworkers, which issued a statement praising \u201cher proven track record of getting things done.\u201d\n\nSeparately, Pelosi released a letter from 11 other unions that are endorsing her speakership bid. Six of those were new endorsements: the Air Line Pilots Association, American Federation of Government Employees, United Auto Workers, United Brotherhood of Carpenters, United Food and Commercial Workers and National Association of Letter Carriers.\n\n11:45 a.m.: Ernst prevails in race for GOP\u2019s No. 5 spot in Senate\n\nSen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) emerged as the winner Wednesday over Sen. Deb Fischer (R-Neb.) in the contest for vice chairman of the Senate Republican Conference.\n\nThe race for the No. 5 position among Senate Republicans pitted two female lawmakers against one another for a spot in GOP leadership ranks dominated by white men.\n\nMcConnell has said he has been seeking to add women to the leadership team for years.\n\n11:15 a.m.: Fudge says she has not ruled out challenging Pelosi for speaker\n\nRep. Marcia L. Fudge (D-Ohio) said Wednesday that she is being encouraged to run for speaker if Pelosi does not have the votes.\n\n\u201cI have ruled out nothing,\u201d Fudge told reporters. \u201cBut what I\u2019m saying is I haven\u2019t given it any thought. I am getting encouraged. That is what made me start finally thinking about it.\u201d\n\nFudge said that \u201cit\u2019s clear\u201d she will not support Pelosi for speaker. She said she expects other Democratic candidates to emerge if it becomes likely that Pelosi, the current minority leader, does not have the votes in January.\n\n\u201cLet us just hypothetically say that there are not enough votes for her to win on the floor,\u201d Fudge said. \u201cSomeone will emerge, if no one has emerged before that. We\u2019re not going to allow the Republicans to have a speaker.\u201d\n\n11:05 a.m.: Pelosi: \u201cI will be speaker of the House\u201d\n\nPelosi sought to push back Wednesday on another Democrat\u2019s prediction that she would fall short in her bid to become speaker next year.\n\nRep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.), a leader of the anti-Pelosi faction, is advancing the idea that Pelosi cannot round up enough support.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a busy person, but I will be the speaker of the House no matter what he said,\u201d Pelosi told reporters in response.\n\n11 a.m.: Leading Pelosi opponent raises possibility that Pelosi could be speaker if other changes are secured\n\nRep. Ed Perl\u00admutter (D-Colo.), a leading opponent of Pelosi\u2019s bid for House speakership, said Wednesday that the now-minority leader could possibly be elected speaker if other changes are made in the ranks of Democratic leadership.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a possibility,\u201d Perl\u00admutter told reporters. \u201cBut there haven\u2019t been any discussions about that, but it\u2019s certainly a possibility.\u201d\n\nPerlmutter did not spell out what changes would be necessary for Pelosi to garner the support of those Democrats opposed to her speakership bid, but there has been talk about asking her to limit her tenure and shaking up the No. 2 and No. 3 Democratic positions in the House.\n\nSome Democrats are also interested in rule changes that would decentralize power in the chamber.\n\n\u201cPeople want to see change, and I think a lot of these candidates ran on change \u2014 and that includes our leadership team, which has been in place for 16 or 17 years now,\u201d Perl\u00admutter said. \u201cPeople ran saying they were coming to Washington for change, and this was a change election. So that\u2019s the bottom line.\u201d\n\n10:45 a.m.: Thune elected by Republicans as majority whip\n\nRepublicans, meeting behind closed doors, selected Sen. John Thune (S.D.) as the majority whip, according to his spokesman.\n\nThune succeeds Sen. John Cornyn (Tex.) in the No. 2 GOP slot. Cornyn was term-limited.\n\n10:30 a.m.: Democrats reelect full leadership slate\n\nBesides maintaining Schumer as minority leader, Senate Democrats also decided Wednesday to keep the rest of their leadership team in place, according to an individual familiar with the proceedings.\n\nThat includes Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) as minority whip and Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) as assistant minority leader, according to the person, who was not authorized to release the results and requested anonymity.\n\nOthers retaining leadership positions included Sens. Debbie Stabenow (Mich.), Mark R. Warner (Va.), Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), Bernie Sanders (Vt.), Joe Manchin III (W.Va.) and Tammy Baldwin (Wis.).\n\n10:15 a.m.: Senate Republicans reelect McConnell as their leader\n\nMeeting behind closed doors Wednesday, Senate Republicans decided to keep McConnell as majority leader, according to an individual familiar with the proceedings.\n\nMcConnell was elected by acclamation, according to the person, who was not authorized to release the result and requested anonymity.\n\nMcConnell led the GOP to victory in the midterm Senate elections, albeit by a narrow margin. Republicans have a 51-47 advantage in the chamber, with races in Florida and Mississippi unresolved.\n\n10:05 a.m.: Senate Democrats reelect Schumer as minority leader\n\nSenate Democrats on Wednesday decided to stick with Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) as minority leader, according to a person familiar with the proceedings.\n\nSchumer was elected by acclamation during a closed-door meeting of Democrats, according to the person, who was not authorized to release the result and requested anonymity.\n\nAlthough Democrats fell short in claiming the Senate majority in the midterm elections, Schumer held losses to a minimum despite a brutal political map. Ten Democratic incumbents sought reelection in states President Trump won in 2016. Six won, while one race, Florida, remains unresolved.\n\n10 a.m.: Jordan not giving up without a fight for minority leader\n\nThough House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) is on track to assume his party\u2019s top leadership post, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) is not giving up without a fight.\n\nInside a closed-door meeting of dejected Republicans Tuesday night, Jordan made the case that he \u2014 a combative former champion wrestler who has served on high-profile committees and a fixture on cable news \u2014 would be best equipped to spar with Democrats.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re entering a world we haven\u2019t really seen,\u201d he said after the meeting, rattling off the names of incoming Democratic leaders. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be intense, and I\u2019ve been in that world now for 12 years . . . So I think it\u2019s going to take an attitude and an intensity about standing up for the truth and fighting.\u201d\n\nWhile Jordan has a base of support on the far right of the Republican conference, McCarthy has developed close relationships across its whole breadth during his 12 years in office \u2014 much of it spent on the road, recruiting Republican candidate and raising tens of millions of dollars to elect them. Inside the meeting Tuesday, McCarthy made the case that he was best equipped not only to stand up to Democrats but to get the House back in GOP hands after the 2020 elections.\n\nMcCarthy declined to comment Tuesday.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got a proven record of working hard for everybody, not just one group or another group,\u201d said Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.), who survived a tough race last week. \u201cHe can represent the entire party. He\u2019s done it. It\u2019s not just talk.\u201d\n\nStill, many Republicans are calling for some sort of accountability following the party\u2019s massive losses. While the president\u2019s party has lost about 30 House seats on average in their first midterm election, Republicans are on track to lose closer to 40, with nine races still uncalled. At least four of those losses, and potentially as many as six, were in McCarthy\u2019s home state of California.\n\n9:25 a.m.: Gov. Rick Scott won\u2019t say whether he still considers Florida vote fraudulent\n\nAs newly elected Republican senators gathered for photos on Wednesday, Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) declined to say whether he still believes the vote count in his state is fraudulent.\n\nScott\u2019s race for Senate is under recount. Last week, he floated without evidence the possibility of \u201crampant fraud\u201d in two Democratic-leaning counties in Florida as his lead over Sen. Bill Nelson (D) narrowed.\n\n9:20 a.m.: Pelosi: \u201cCome on in, the water\u2019s warm\u201d\n\nPelosi playfully invited challengers to her bid for speaker to step forward Wednesday.\n\nAsked by a reporter what she says to Democrats who are opposing her and may run against her, Pelosi said, \u201cCome on in, the water\u2019s warm.\u201d It\u2019s a phrase she has used on multiple occasions in recent days as she tries to shore up support.\n\nPelosi spoke ahead of a Democratic caucus meeting that she said would focus on the lame-duck session of Congress. The leadership race is expected to be the focus of another meeting later Wednesday.\n\nSeung Min Kim, Felicia Sonmez, Elise Viebeck and Erica Werner contributed to this report.\n\nRead more at PowerPost", "\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell speaks to members of the media at the Capitol on Nov. 7. (Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP)\n\nThe date was Oct. 23, 2010 \u2014 nearly two years into President Barack Obama\u2019s first term and two weeks before the first midterm elections of his presidency. Speaking to the National Journal, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) made a now-infamous statement: \u201cThe single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president.\u201d\n\nAs The Washington Post\u2019s Glenn Kessler has pointed out, reading the quote in its full context makes it clear that McConnell was saying that it would be impossible for Republicans to achieve their policy goals with Obama in office. But Democrats immediately seized on the remark as proof that Republicans had single-mindedly set out to obstruct Obama\u2019s agenda, putting partisanship ahead of the country\u2019s best interest.\n\nOn Tuesday, a week after Democrats won control of the House of Representatives, McConnell, now the majority leader, published a FoxNews.com op-ed that struck a very different note. \u201cWill Dems work with us, or simply put partisan politics ahead of the country?\u201d the headline asked. Needless to say, it didn\u2019t go over well with liberals, who rushed to point out McConnell\u2019s unparalleled chutzpah and accuse him of blatant hypocrisy.\n\nSuch an ironic Op-Ed title coming from you @senatemajldr - don\u2019t you think? https://t.co/RFJVeRp6z4 \u2014 Amy McGrath (@AmyMcGrathKY) November 14, 2018\n\nMy latest Op-Ed: \u201cOur number one priority should be ensuring that Mitch McConnell is an only-one-more-term Majority Leader.\u201d https://t.co/yiASk0S4ud \u2014 Pat Cunnane (@PatCunnane) November 14, 2018\n\nThe op-ed began with McConnell recounting what Republicans have accomplished over the past two years: passing tax cuts, confirming two Supreme Court nominees and rolling back federal regulations. \u201cAfter this prolific run, I was not surprised to be asked over the past week about just how much the American people can expect from the next Congress under divided leadership,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWhat can we realistically accomplish?\u201d\n\nThe good news, McConnell answered, is that \u201creports of the death of bipartisanship in Washington have been wildly exaggerated.\u201d Legislation targeting the opioid epidemic, increasing defense funding, reforming the Department of Veterans Affairs and funding infrastructure improvements passed with support from both parties, he noted. Then, in an abrupt tack, he argued that Democrats, having regained control of the House, should refrain from investigating President Trump:\n\nThe Senate has proven its ability to reach bipartisan solutions to some of the most pressing challenges facing our nation. And looking ahead to the coming year, there will be no shortage of opportunities to continue this impressive record of cooperation across the aisle and across the Capitol. What we can make of those opportunities will depend on our Democratic colleagues. Will they choose to go it alone and simply make political points? Or will they choose to work together and actually make a difference? Last week, the American people made it abundantly clear that they prefer that Congress focus on making a difference. That message may have been lost on a few House Democrats, who have made clear their preference for investigations over policy results. After years of rhetoric, it\u2019s hardly news that some are more interested in fanning the flames of division than reaching across the aisle.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, McConnell (or, more likely, a member of his staff) posted a link to the op-ed on Twitter. By midnight, he had received over 29,000 replies. Virtually all of them were from aggrieved liberals, many of whom responded with just one name: Merrick Garland, Obama\u2019s Supreme Court nominee, whose appointment was blocked by McConnell.\n\nAmong the other responses:\n\n\u201cI hope we work with you the same way you worked with President Obama.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that every time Mitch McConnell tries to use the word \u2018partisan\u2019 a pie should hit him in the face.\u201d\n\n\u201cDude, you are in my lifetime one of the most zero-sum partisans I\u2019ve ever witnessed in politics. That\u2019s not something to be proud of. It\u2019s the reason why Congress is so dysfunctional.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou kept Democrats off all committees and withheld all information, so no. Go eat worms.\u201d\n\n\u201cLol seriously?! How often did you work with Dems? How many times did you shut them out of major decisions when you had the majority or rammed things down our throats? Maybe you should have had this epiphany before now.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr McConnell, yes, you\u2019re the world\u2019s top expert on putting party above country. No one has ever done so more blatantly than you. But now YOU are calling for bipartisanship? Your hypocrisy is astounding. Obviously, no decent American is going to take you seriously.\u201d\n\nMcConnell\u2019s office couldn\u2019t be reached for comment on the Twitter reaction late Tuesday night. It\u2019s worth noting that his sentiments, however unpopular online, are not entirely out of sync with top Democratic Party leaders.

Law enforcement agencies disclosed 7,175 hate crimes in America during 2017, up from 6,121 in 2016. This is the third consecutive year that reported hate crimes have increased, and it\u2019s the single biggest spike since the surge of incidents targeting Muslims in 2001 after the attacks on Sept. 11.\n\nBut the reporting of these incidents remains uneven and inconsistent, both by victims and law enforcement. The definition of \u201chate crimes\u201d varies by state, as do punishments, and even the federal standard has shifted over time. The FBI, which has pleaded for more cooperation from local law enforcement, notes that about 1,000 more agencies contributed information for this year\u2019s report than last year\u2019s. But those additional numbers don\u2019t explain much of the increase. Massachusetts reports lots of incidents, for example, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean there are more hate crimes per capita than in Mississippi, which experts say underreports.\n\n-- \u201cOf the hate crimes that likely occur each year in our country, only about 1 percent are reported in official federal statistics,\u201d estimates Maya Berry, executive director of the Arab American Institute.\n\n-- One especially startling figure: The FBI\u2019s new report shows anti-Semitic hate crimes rose 37 percent in 2017. \u201cThe new FBI data comes less than a month after the worst anti-Semitic attack in U.S. history \u2014 a shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue that killed 11 and wounded six,\u201d Devlin Barrett notes. \u201cThe suspect in that attack has been charged with dozens of federal hate crimes, and that one incident alone accounted for nearly as many hate crime killings as were recorded all of last year in the United States: 15.\u201d\n\n-- But the Anti-Defamation League\u2019s independent annual audit of anti-Semitic incidents, which the group has been tracking closely since 1979, found an even bigger jump of 57 percent in 2017, compared to 2016.\n\nThe ADL notes that 16,149 law enforcement agencies participated in the FBI\u2019s 2017 crime data collection effort, but only 2,040 of these agencies, about 13 percent, reported one or more hate crimes to the FBI. That means 87 percent of police agencies reported that there were zero hate crimes to the FBI. To prod them to be more forthcoming and/or change the way they classify incidents, the ADL posted a list of 91 cities with populations exceeding 100,000 people that either did not report any data to the FBI about hate crimes or reported that there were zero such crimes in their jurisdiction during 2017.\n\n-- Not knowing just how many hate crimes are truly happening makes it harder to address the problem. \u201cYou can\u2019t move what you can\u2019t measure,\u201d said Jonathan Greenblatt, the ADL\u2019s chief executive. \u201cIt is incumbent on police departments, mayors, governors and county officials across the country to tally hate crimes data and report it to the FBI. The FBI can only report the data they receive. We must do more to make sure that cities report credible data.\u201d\n\n-- A few specific examples: \u201cIn 2017, the city of Miami reported zero hate crimes, while Miami-Dade County reported one,\u201d the Los Angeles Times\u2019s Jaweed Kaleem reports. \u201cOf the 28 law enforcement agencies the FBI requested numbers from in Mississippi, 27 reported zero hate crimes or did not respond. The one that replied said there was one hate crime during the year. \u2026 Olathe, Kan., the location of last year\u2019s deadly shooting of an Indian-born engineer after a man yelled at him about his immigration status, reported zero hate crimes.\u201d\n\n-- Some observers say that the climate of racial hatred has been stoked by President Trump's incendiary rhetoric, in which he has demeaned illegal immigrants, insulted African American reporters and suggested Jewish businessman George Soros, a prominent liberal donor, might be responsible for funding the migrant caravan headed to the U.S. border.\n\nWHAT CAN BE DONE:\n\n-- After the synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh, the DOJ announced an $840,000 grant to study the collection of hate-crimes data. \u201cIn a typical year, the Justice Department charges a few dozen people with hate crimes, and local and state law-enforcement agencies deal with a few thousand of their own cases. But the Justice Department itself \u2014 through its research arm, the Bureau of Justice Statistics, which conducts surveys of crime victims \u2014 has found reason to believe that about two hundred and fifty thousand hate crimes were committed in the United States each year between 2004 and 2015,\u201d the New Yorker\u2019s Eric Lach reports.\n\n-- The Brennan Center, part of NYU\u2019s law school, released a report last month suggesting that Congress could pass legislation to standardize what information must be reported and to require that it be more specific.\n\n-- Last night, the city council in Charleston, S.C. \u2014 where nine African Americans were killed by a white supremacist at their church in 2015 \u2014 voted to advance a new \u201chate intimidation\u201d ordinance. The local government decided to act because the state government has failed to do so. \u201cSouth Carolina is one of five states that does not legally recognize hate crimes. That means it is up to the Department of Justice to determine if they\u2019ll seek prosecution,\u201d according to WCSC, the Charleston CBS affiliate. \u201cThe ordinance says people will be punished if they have the intent to intimidate another person because of their perceived race, color, creed, religion, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, physical or mental disability or national origin.\u201d In August, a transgender woman was attacked in downtown Charleston. The police chief said the new law could have applied to that assault case if it had been on the books.\n\n-- There are other yawning gaps in the law. The white man accused of fatally shooting two African Americans inside a Kroger grocery store last month is facing murder charges in Kentucky, and authorities say the incident was racially motivated. But the local prosecutor says he cannot charge Gregory Bush with a hate crime because the state\u2019s hate crimes statute does not cover homicides.\n\nIN OUR OWN BACKYARD:\n\n-- Don\u2019t delude yourself: This is not a regional problem. This is a national crisis.\n\n-- The most chilling story you will read today: \u201cA D.C. man who described himself as a white nationalist to law enforcement officers and became a social-media follower of the suspect in the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting has been arrested on a gun charge,\u201d Spencer Hsu and Peter Hermann report. \u201cJeffrey R. Clark Jr., 30, is charged with illegally possessing a firearm and a high-capacity magazine and made his initial court appearance Tuesday afternoon in U.S. District Court in Washington. \u2026 Clark, who lives in the Bloomingdale neighborhood, was arrested \u2026 after two family members alerted police to his increasingly agitated outbursts, including that the 11 victims of the Pittsburgh shooting \u2018deserved it.\u2019 The outbursts occurred in the wake of Clark\u2019s brother\u2019s suicide.\n\n\u201cRelatives told police both brothers had been involved in alt-right movements \u2026 Jeffrey Clark told FBI agents he and his brother became interested in guns in 2016 \u2018because they believed there was going to be a civil war,\u2019 according to an account of his statement filed in court. Court papers assert that after his brother\u2019s death, Jeffrey Clark posted on Gab a photo of the brothers wearing masks and holding a shotgun and a rifle, in front of a flag with a skull and cross bones. \u2026 Of the attack on the synagogue, court papers said Jeffrey Clark posted a picture of the suspected gunman spattered in what appears to be blood and wrote, \u2018This was a dry run for things to come.\u2019\n\n\u201cAuthorities said in the court documents that the brothers \u2018fantasized about killing \u201cJews and blacks\u201d' \u2026 The documents said the brothers had four guns between them \u2026 Court papers said Clark\u2019s relatives told authorities that Clark admired Oklahoma bomber Timothy McVeigh, Unabomber Ted Kaczynski and killer Charles Manson and that relatives said \u2018Jeffrey and Edward Clark believed there would be a race revolution and they wanted to expedite it.\u2019 Clark, wearing an orange prison jumpsuit, did not enter a plea and said little at the hearing beyond confirming that he was a high school graduate and needed an appointed attorney.\u201d\n\n-- Also: It got lost last week because the news broke on the afternoon of Election Day, but a D.C. firefighter was charged with a hate crime in Pennsylvania related to a road rage incident. When he was off duty, the 32-year-old allegedly waved a handgun from inside his pickup truck at two African Americans, yelled racial slurs and said he\u2019d hang the male driver from a tree. He denies the charges and is now on leave pending the outcomes of the criminal proceedings.\n\nAura Wharton-Beck, left, an assistant professor at the University of St. Thomas, clasps hands last month with Kevyn Perkins, center, during a moment of silence before a protest in the Anderson Student Center in St. Paul, Minn. (Jean Pieri/Pioneer Press/AP)\n\nARE THE KIDS ALRIGHT?\n\n-- We hear all the time about supposed P.C. culture on campus, but often overlooked are near daily flashes of hate at colleges that are clearly intended to demean racial and religious minorities. The AP\u2019s Collin Binkley reported last week on several such incidents in October alone that drew little national attention:\n\n\u201cKevyn Perkins stopped cold when he saw the letters scrawled on the door to his dorm: \u2018N----- go back\u2019 it said, inked in messy red marker. First he was blinded by confusion. Then rage. And then all he could think about was dropping out, finding a new school, escaping for good. \u2018I thought maybe I don\u2019t belong here. So I called my brother and I said, \u2018pick me up,\u2019\u2019 said Perkins, 19, a freshman at the University of St. Thomas, a private and mostly white school in St. Paul, Minnesota. \u2018He said that\u2019s what they want you to do \u2014 you have to stay there and stay strong.\u2019 \u2026 Since he found the note Oct. 19, Perkins has become more withdrawn, he said, less outgoing. And although he decided to stay at St. Thomas, he\u2019s left to wonder who on campus felt such hatred for him, and why.\n\n\u201cAt the College of the Holy Cross in central Massachusetts, a student was beaten in an assault that officials say was motivated by the victim\u2019s sexual orientation. No one has been arrested in connection with the crime. Students at DePauw University in Indiana reported four separate cases of hate speech in October. In three, racial and homophobic slurs and threats were yelled from cars passing by campus. In another case, a threat with the N-word was found in an elevator on campus. Anti-Semitic posters appeared at the University of California, Davis, blaming Jews for allegations of sexual assault that were made against Justice Brett Kavanaugh.\n\n\u201cAn Indiana woman was arrested last week after leaving a racist letter directed at African-American neighbors, urging them to leave the neighborhood because black people weren\u2019t welcome. As early voting started in North Carolina, a black Republican volunteer was accosted with slurs and had a gun pulled on him at a polling place, leading to one man\u2019s arrest. An Uber passenger in Colorado was arrested after threatening his Middle Eastern driver and chasing him down the street because police said he \u2018hated all brown people.\u2019 Violent clashes broke out in New York City after a speech by the founder of a far-right group, leading to three arrests. In a Texas courtroom, a man was sentenced to 24 years in prison on Oct. 17 for torching a mosque near the U.S.-Mexico border last year because of what authorities said was a \u2018rabid hatred\u2019 of Muslims.\u201d\n\nPresident Ronald Reagan and first lady Nancy visit Barbara and Phillip Butler and their daughter Natasha in College Park, Md., in May 1982. (Barry Thumma/AP)\n\nWHAT PRESIDENTIAL LEADERSHIP CAN DO:\n\n-- Ronald Reagan\u2019s daughter, Patti Davis, recalls a little remembered but symbolically significant moment of her father\u2019s presidency in an op-ed for today\u2019s newspaper:\n\n\u201cOn the morning of May 3, 1982, my father read a story in The Post about a black family in Maryland \u2014 the Butlers \u2014 who\u2019d had a cross burned on their lawn in 1977. William M. Aitcheson, an \u2018exalted cyclops\u2019 of the Ku Klux Klan, was charged with the crime. Now, five years later, a federal judge had ordered him to pay the Butlers a civil judgment of $23,000. Except Aitcheson had apparently disappeared. When my father went down to the Oval Office that morning, he announced that he wanted to go visit the Butlers \u2014 that day.\n\n\u201cMy parents sat with them in their living room and listened to what they had been subjected to as one of only five black families in the area. A car had driven onto their front lawn and taken out their lamppost. Garbage had been dumped onto their property. Then came the cross-burning. The cross was six feet tall and heavy. It was doubtful that Aitcheson had carried out the burning alone, but he had been the only one charged. \u2018This isn\u2019t something that should ever happen in America,\u2019 my father told them.\n\n\u201cThirty-five years later, another president learned of neo-Nazis marching through the streets of Charlottesville, which had led to the death of a young woman who bravely came out to counterprotest. The president\u2019s reaction: \u2018There are very fine people on both sides.\u2019\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t something that should ever happen in America. We need to remember this when a campaign ad put out by the current president\u2019s political team is so racist that even Fox News won\u2019t run it. Or when the president proudly calls himself a nationalist and berates black female journalists, calling their questions \u2018stupid\u2019 and them incompetent. We need to remember, when children are ripped from their mothers\u2019 arms and put into cages, that there was a time when such a thing wouldn\u2019t happen in this country. These days, when blatant racism has been allowed to emerge from the shadows and sweep through neighborhoods, so that young black boys are yelled at for mowing a neighbor\u2019s lawn, we need to think about how other presidents \u2014 including my father \u2014 viewed leadership.\u201d\n\nWelcome to the Daily 202, PowerPost's morning briefing for decision-makers.\n\nSign up to receive the newsletter.\n\nA portion of a once classified CIA report that disclosed the existence of a program dubbed Project Medication.

(Geoffroy Van Der HasseltAFP/Getty Images)\n\nWEST WING INTRIGUE:\n\n-- Trump has been lashing out in frustration over the midterm results and his poorly received Europe trip. Josh Dawsey and Philip Rucker report: \u201cAs he jetted to Paris last Friday, [Trump] received a congratulatory phone call aboard Air Force One. British Prime Minister Theresa May was calling to celebrate the Republican Party\u2019s wins in the midterm elections \u2014 never mind that Democrats seized control of the House \u2014 but her appeal to the American president\u2019s vanity was met with an ornery outburst. Trump berated May for Britain not doing enough, in his assessment, to contain Iran. He questioned her over Brexit and complained about the trade deals he sees as unfair with European countries. May has endured Trump\u2019s churlish temper before, but still her aides were shaken by his especially foul mood \u2026 that testy call set the tone for five days of fury \u2014 evident in Trump\u2019s splenetic tweets and described in interviews with 14 senior administration officials, outside Trump confidants and foreign diplomats...\n\n\u201cDuring his 43-hour stay in Paris, Trump brooded over the Florida recounts and sulked over key races being called for Democrats in the midterm elections that he had claimed as a \u2018big victory.\u2019 He erupted at his staff over media coverage of his decision to skip a ceremony honoring the military sacrifice of World War I. The president also was angry and resentful over French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s public rebuke of rising nationalism, which Trump considered a personal attack. And that was after his difficult meeting with Macron, where officials said little progress was made as Trump again brought up his frustrations over trade and Iran. ... 'He was frustrated with the trip. And he\u2019s itching to make some changes,' said one senior White House official. 'This is a week where things could get really dicey.'\n\n\u201cHe told advisers over the weekend that he \u2026 was seriously considering replacing White House chief of staff John F. Kelly, who scrambled early this week to try to save [DHS Secretary Kirstjen] Nielsen\u2019s job. The senior White House official, who speaks to the president regularly, said Trump has been grousing lately about getting rid of Kelly. \u2018But he\u2019s done this three or four times before,\u2019 the person said. \u2018Nothing is ever real until he sends the tweet.\u2019\n\n\u201cDuring Sunday\u2019s flight to Washington from Paris, aides filed into the president\u2019s private cabin to lobby against the leading contender to replace Kelly, Nick Ayers, who is Vice President Pence\u2019s chief of staff. These aides told Trump that appointing Ayers would lower staff morale and perhaps trigger an exodus. But the president has continued to praise Ayers, who also enjoys the support of Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, according to multiple White House officials.\n\n\u201cFirst lady Melania Trump shared her husband\u2019s irritation and impatience with some of the staff. On Tuesday, amid reports that the president had decided to oust deputy national security adviser Mira R. Ricardel over tensions between her and other administration officials, the first lady\u2019s office issued an extraordinary statement to reporters calling for her firing. \u2026 In her role as No. 2 to national security adviser John Bolton, Ricardel berated colleagues in meetings, yelled at military aides and White House professional staff, argued with Melania Trump regarding her recent trip to Africa and spread rumors about Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, according to three current and two former White House officials. Kelly has sought for months to oust Ricardel, calling her a problematic hire in the West Wing, and Mattis has told advisers that he wants her out as well.\u201d\n\n-- The first lady\u2019s problems with Ricardel appear to stem from her trip last month to Africa. The New York Times\u2019s Maggie Haberman, Helene Cooper and Ron Nixon report: \u201cMs. Ricardel had announced the trip before it was fully planned, according to one [source], and then threatened to pull resources for it after learning that she did not have a seat on Mrs. Trump\u2019s plane. After the trip ended, Ms. Ricardel made accusations of inappropriate behavior by Mrs. Trump\u2019s most trusted staff members, including Lindsay Reynolds, the first lady\u2019s chief of staff \u2014 claims that a person close to the first lady said were false.\u201d\n\n-- NBC News reports that Kelly may soon exit the White House after clashes with the first lady over staffing and travel requests. Carol E. Lee, Kristen Welker, Hallie Jackson and Courtney Kube report: \u201cSome of the disputes with the East Wing have escalated to the president, ... seven people familiar with the clashes said. \u2026 Melania Trump raised concerns with her husband earlier this year, amid the height of the controversy over his alleged affair with porn actress Stormy Daniels, that Kelly had repeatedly denied her requests to promote some of her aides, two White House officials [said]. \u2026 Trump was especially annoyed, according to people familiar with his thinking, that he had to get involved in disputes involving his wife. His message to Kelly, according to one of them, repeatedly has been: \u2018Deal with it.\u2019 \u2026 A White House official said the first lady has not pushed for his departure, noting that she likes Kelly personally and gets along with him. But tensions with her office, on top of his intensifying power struggle with Bolton, have reignited speculation that Trump will replace him before the end of the year.\u201d\n\n-- Trump is considering former acting ICE director Thomas Homan to replace Nielsen. Politico\u2019s Gabby Orr and Ted Hesson report: \u201cTapping Homan to run the Department of Homeland Security would almost certainly energize Trump\u2019s base. The tough-talking lawman once recommended charging so-called sanctuary city politicians \u2018with crimes\u2019 and has pugnaciously defended even Trump\u2019s most controversial immigration moves, including separating children from their parents at the border.\u201d\n\n-- CNN filed a lawsuit against the White House to get reporter Jim Acosta\u2019s press pass restored. Paul Farhi reports: \u201cThe unusual lawsuit, an escalation of Trump\u2019s long-running war of words with CNN, seeks a judge\u2019s intervention after Trump banished Acosta from the White House grounds for an indefinite period after a brief altercation between Acosta and a White House press aide. \u2026 Late Tuesday afternoon, the judge in the case, Timothy J. Kelly, ordered the White House and the other defendants to respond to CNN\u2019s motion for a temporary restraining order by 11 a.m. Wednesday. He set a hearing on the restraining order \u2014 which would temporarily restore Acosta\u2019s press credential, pending the outcome of a trial \u2014 for 3 p.m. Wednesday. Legal experts say the network\u2019s chances of winning in court are favorable.\u201d\n\n-- Trump has refused to consider arguments against nationalism, which Macron called a \u201cbetrayal of patriotism.\u201d Anne Gearan reports: \u201cInstead, Trump, who once avoided calling himself a nationalist, flaunted his embrace of the term and suggested that Macron do the same while arguing the French president was criticizing him to distract from his poor poll numbers.\u201d\n\n-- Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) wrote a Wall Street Journal op-ed defending Trump\u2019s embrace of nationalism: \u201cTrump is right to embrace the label \u2018nationalist,\u2019 because a true American nationalism isn\u2019t about a national identity based on race, religion or ethnicity. Instead, it is based on our identity as a nation committed to the idea that all people are created equal, with a God-given right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\u201d\n\n-- Trump will nominate retired Army Gen. John Abizaid to become the U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia. Anne Gearan and Dan Lamothe report: \u201c[The vacancy] was spotlighted by the difficult diplomacy between the United States and Riyadh over the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The post has been vacant throughout Trump\u2019s presidency. Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have blamed Senate Democrats for holding up nominations, but no one had been nominated for the job until now. Turkey, where [Post columnist] Khashoggi was killed last month, also has no U.S. ambassador. Abizaid, best known from his time overseeing the Iraq War, is now a consultant and a fellow at Stanford University\u2019s Hoover Institution.\u201d\n\nTHE NEW CONGRESS:\n\n-- House Democrats fear a Freedom Caucus-like insurgency from the liberal wing could derail their plans once they take control of the chamber. Mike DeBonis reports: \u201c[Nancy] Pelosi\u2019s opponents are threatening to withhold their votes on the House floor even after an anticipated party vote nominating her as the next speaker. That is a page straight out of the Freedom Caucus playbook \u2014 used to deny Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (Calif.) the speakership in 2015. Top Democrats are warning rank-and-file members not to go down that road, underscoring a growing backlash to the anti-Pelosi faction. \u2026 A critical test may come later this week as Democrats consider an internal rule change to raise the threshold vote for nominating a speaker candidate from a simple majority to 218 votes. The change is expected to fail, in a boost for Pelosi.\u201d\n\n-- Pelosi has launched an aggressive charm offensive to try to snag the speakership. Politico\u2019s John Bresnahan, Rachael Bade and Kyle Cheney report: \u201cOn Tuesday afternoon, Pelosi held a reception for all Democrats at Osteria Morini, an Italian restaurant by the D.C. waterfront. On Wednesday, the members-elect will be introduced to their colleagues at a Democratic Caucus meeting, a lengthy process that will put them onstage with Pelosi. The California Democrat will follow that up with an appearance at the Congressional Black Caucus \u2026 Democratic Party luminaries are calling members-elect on Pelosi's behalf as well. Govs. Andrew Cuomo of New York and Tom Wolf of Pennsylvania have weighed in, as have former Vice President Al Gore and former Secretary of State and longtime Democratic Sen. John Kerry, according to Democratic aides.\u201d\n\n-- Nine centrist Democrats are demanding a vote on their proposed rules changes to House operations in exchange for their support of Pelosi. From DeBonis: \u201cThe reforms range from making it easier to get amendment votes to ending the ability of a single disgruntled lawmaker to force a vote on ousting a sitting speaker. The centerpieces of the effort are mechanisms that would streamline the process of considering bills with broad bipartisan support on the House floor \u2014 at the price of eroding the power of the majority party\u2019s leadership to control what gets put up for a vote.\u201d\n\n-- House Republicans will hold closed-door elections today, with Kevin McCarthy expected to cruise to the top role of minority leader. The AP\u2019s Lisa Mascaro reports: \u201cBut the Californian has struggled in the past to build support from conservatives. He faces a longshot challenge from Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, a co-founder of the House Freedom Caucus who has support from outside conservative groups and got a second-look during a nearly two-hour candidate forum Tuesday. \u2026 Most GOP lawmakers, though, prefer McCarthy\u2019s more affable approach, and he remained favored to win Wednesday.\u201d\n\nHouse Republicans vented frustrations about their loss of the majority during a closed-door meeting last night. From Mascaro: \u201cRepublicans complained about the unpopularity of the GOP tax law they blamed for losses in New York and other key states, some attendees told reporters after the meeting. Some in the meeting said Republicans should have tried harder to fulfill [Trump\u2019s] priorities, like funding for the border wall with Mexico. They also warned that they need a new fundraising mechanism to compete with the small-dollar online donors that powered Democrats to victory.\u201d\n\n-- Trump has urged McCarthy to strike a deal with Jordan. Politico\u2019s Rachael Bade, John Bresnahan and Kyle Cheney report: \u201cIt remains unclear what exactly the deal would entail. The discussions between the president and McCarthy about Jordan, which took place last week, set off a round of speculation among lawmakers inside the Capitol that Trump may try to push Jordan to become the top Republican lawmaker on the House Judiciary Committee \u2026 Jordan wants that position, according to GOP lawmakers and aides. And Trump thinks Jordan would be a ferocious defender.\u201d\n\n-- Democrats are on track to hold about 30 House seats that went for Trump in 2016, which could complicate their legislative agenda. From Paul Kane: \u201cThat\u2019s a large degree of political exposure, given that the size of their House majority will be about half that when the final races are called \u2026 They now must decide how to govern: Go bold, brandishing an aggressive liberal agenda that tells voters what Democrats stand for and what to expect from their eventual presidential standard-bearer in 2020; or play it safe with a disciplined approach that doesn\u2019t scare off independent voters ahead of the battle for the White House.\u201d\n\n-- Mitch McConnell wrote an op-ed advising House Democrats to \u201cwork together [with the Republican Senate] and actually make a difference.\u201d He writes on FoxNews.com: \u201cLast week, the American people made it abundantly clear that they prefer that Congress focus on making a difference. That message may have been lost on a few House Democrats, who have made clear their preference for investigations over policy results. After years of rhetoric, it\u2019s hardly news that some are more interested in fanning the flames of division than reaching across the aisle. But however Democrats interpret the latest message from voters, Senate Republicans will continue our commitment to delivering results.\u201d\n\nA worker loads ballots into machines at the Broward County Supervisor of Elections office during a recount in Lauderhill, Fla. (Brynn Anderson/AP)\n\nFLORIDA, FLORIDA, FLORIDA:\n\n-- Sen. Bill Nelson (D) filed a lawsuit to extend the deadline to finish the recount in the close Senate race against Republican Gov. Rick Scott. Sean Sullivan, Beth Reinhard, Vanessa Williams and Lori Rozsa report: \u201c[Nelson] and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee filed a suit in federal court Tuesday evening seeking to extend the deadline to finish the count in all 67 counties. Separately, Nelson and the state party went to court to try to loosen the rules for a manual recount as both parties braced for the ultra-close Senate race to come down to a hand inspection of ballots. On Capitol Hill, Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) urged Florida elections officials to take as much time as they need to tally votes, even if they blow past a key deadline. He also demanded that [Scott], who is narrowly ahead of Nelson in the Senate race, recuse himself from the recount. Scott\u2019s campaign swiftly rejected that notion, which is the subject of a suit expected to be heard in federal court this week.\u201d\n\n-- Top officials in both parties privately agree Nelson\u2019s gap will be difficult to overcome.\n\n-- Two Florida election officials at the center of the recount were harassed online. Craig Timberg and Beth Reinhard report: \u201cSeveral pro-Trump Facebook pages and one Twitter account on Monday posted the home address and phone number of [Brenda Snipes,] the Broward County, Fla., election supervisor who has been the target of blistering criticism from the president and other Republicans amid highly politicized vote recounts. \u2026 Facebook confirmed Tuesday that it had removed personal information about Snipes after the incident was reported to the company. It also confirmed a similar incident involving Palm Beach County\u2019s Elections Supervisor Susan Bucher, whose home address and phone number also were posted on a Facebook page.\u201d\n\n-- Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi has been offering Trump updates on the Florida recounts as she angles for a position in the administration. Politico\u2019s Annie Karni and Marc Caputo report: \u201c[S]ince the midterms, she has been serving as one of [Trump\u2019s] point people on the ground there, remaining in frequent contact with the president and giving him personal updates, according to a senior White House official and Florida officials. For the longtime close friend of Trump\u2019s, the timing of the Florida recount, which the president has seized on to push unsupported theories about widespread voter fraud, offers a new chance to be front and center in his mind while he is also reorganizing his Cabinet and quickly shedding officials he has grown weary of.\u201d\n\nRep.-elect Josh Harder (D-Calif.), second from right, campaigns in Modesto last month.

The Associated Press declared Harder the winner in California\u2019s 10th District, which is in the Central Valley east of San Jose. The former venture capitalist leads by around 4,900 votes. Denham was elected with the tea party wave in 2010.\n\n-- Democrat Katie Porter has taken a 261-vote lead over GOP Rep.

But that same year, the district went for Hillary Clinton by more than 5 points after previously electing Mitt Romney by 12 points in 2012. \u2026 And in California\u2019s 39th Congressional District, where a seat opened up after long-serving GOP Rep. Ed Royce announced his retirement, Democrat Gil Cisneros is catching up to Republican Young Kim, who had a healthy lead on election night. \u2026 On election night, Kim was ahead by nearly 4,000. But on Tuesday, she led by only 711.\u201d\n\n-- Rep. Mia Love (R-Utah) trails Democrat Ben McAdams by 0.6 points. The Salt Lake Tribune\u2019s Benjamin Wood reports: \u201cMcAdams held his tenuous lead over [Love] on Tuesday after the addition of roughly 40,000 votes to Utah County\u2019s election totals and 17,000 votes in Salt Lake County. McAdams now leads with 50.3 percent of the vote, compared with 49.7 percent for Love, a margin of 1,229 votes.

Politico\u2019s Eliana Johnson and Darren Samuelsohn report: \u201cThe uproar over the appointment, which effectively removes Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein as [special counsel Bob] Mueller\u2019s primary supervisor, has put Whitaker in a difficult spot, trapped between setting off a political firestorm by clipping Mueller\u2019s wings and angering a president intent on having him do just that. Even Trump\u2019s Justice Department is wavering about whether Whitaker will do the deed the president wanted him for.\n\n\u201cDepartment spokeswoman Kerri Kupec issued a statement late Tuesday signaling that Whitaker could still recuse himself from overseeing the Mueller investigation, a shift from the department\u2019s initial position in the immediate aftermath of Sessions\u2019 ouster that Whitaker had no plans to step out of the way on the Russia probe. \u2026 There is also the fact that Mueller\u2019s investigation may be too far along to merely smother it. A Washington-based defense lawyer representing a senior Trump official in the Russia investigation said Whitaker couldn\u2019t make decisions \u2018based on his seat-of-the-pants preferences.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- Another bad headline: Public records show that, while in private business, Whitaker abandoned a taxpayer-subsidized apartment-rehabilitation project in Iowa amid ongoing problems. The AP\u2019s Ryan J. Foley and David Pitt report: \u201cThe city of Des Moines ultimately yanked an affordable housing loan that Whitaker\u2019s company had been awarded, and another lender began foreclosure proceedings after Whitaker defaulted on a separate loan for nearly $700,000. Several contractors complained they were not paid, and a process server for one could not even find Whitaker or his company to serve him with a lawsuit.\u201d\n\n-- John Yoo, a former deputy assistant attorney general in the George W. Bush administration, called Whitaker\u2019s appointment unconstitutional. He writes in The Atlantic: \u201cTo prevent the president from using appointments to advance his private interests, just as Trump critics today charge, the Constitution prohibits filling the position of attorney general with a series of officials who never received Senate consent. [Rosenstein], Solicitor General Noel Francisco, the several assistant attorneys general, even any of the 93 U.S. attorneys in the nation\u2019s major cities could all temporarily fill in for Sessions, as they received senatorial advice and consent. Whitaker, and any other Justice Department official or employee, cannot.\u201d\n\n-- Mueller is seeking more information about Nigel Farage, a key pro-Brexit campaigner who forged close ties with the 2016 Trump campaign. The Guardian\u2019s Jon Swaine and Stephanie Kirchgaessner report: \u201cJerome Corsi, a conservative author, said prosecutors working for Mueller questioned him about [Farage] two weeks ago in Washington. Corsi said investigators for the special counsel also pressed him for information on Ted Malloch, a London-based American academic with ties to Farage, who informally advised [Trump] and was interviewed by FBI agents earlier this year.\"\n\n-- Trump ally Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) expressed support for a bill to protect Mueller\u2019s probe and urged McConnell to allow a vote on it. \u201cI would certainly vote for it,\u201d Graham told reporters. \u201cI don\u2019t see any movement to get rid of Mueller. But it probably would be good to have this legislation in place just for the future.\u201d McConnell said last week he did not consider the legislation necessary. (Reuters)\n\n-- Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), the likely incoming chair of the House Judiciary Committee, instructed the FBI and Justice to respond to outstanding requests from Democrats before they assume the majority. Karoun Demirjian reports: \u201cNadler stopped short of issuing a threat, subpoena or otherwise, in demanding that [Whitaker] and FBI Director Christopher A. Wray respond by the end of the year to committee Democrats who have written to ask for documents and other information. But the letter serves as a reminder nonetheless that committee Democrats plan to hit the ground running in January \u2014 and offers a hint of where they will focus their attention.\u201d\n\nMichael Bloomberg speaks at a Moms Demand Action gun safety rally in Nashua, N.H. (Cheryl Senter/AP)\n\n2020 WATCH:\n\n-- Top economists predict the U.S. economy could be grappling with a recession as Trump fights for reelection in 2020. Heather Long wrote the most forward-looking story you'll read today: \u201cMost economists are predicting that the economy will be weaker \u2014 or even in a recession \u2014 by the time voters go to the polls in 2020. For Trump and the GOP, the economy was probably a tail wind in these midterms, but it could turn into a substantial head wind by then.\n\n\u201cPessimism is growing on Wall Street about future prospects for earnings and the economy. More than a third of top economic forecasters now predict a U.S. recession in 2020, according to the latest Blue Chip forecast, and 44 percent of fund managers in the latest Bank of America Merrill Lynch survey expect global growth to slow in the next year, the worst outlook for the world economy since November 2008. The list of head winds is expanding: higher borrowing costs, a strong dollar, a weakening global economy, an escalating tariff war, and fading fiscal stimulus from the tax cuts and extra government spending. 'Our forecast has [economic growth] stalling \u2014 that is, zero growth quarter on quarter \u2014 in the first half of 2020,' Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote in a note to clients. 'Gravity can\u2019t be defied forever.'\n\n\u201cThe president will have to decide: Does he take further action to boost growth, or does he blame others for any slowdown?\u201d\n\n-- Michael Bloomberg pledged to make a decision on a White House run by early next year. The AP\u2019s Steve Peoples reports: \u201c\u2018I think January, February would be about as late as you can do it and as early as you can gather enough information,\u2019 Bloomberg said ... The 76-year-old billionaire said his decision would have little to do with other Democratic presidential prospects ... \u2018Thanksgiving, Christmas and then maybe a few weeks into January \u2014 that\u2019s when you really gotta sit down, talk to your advisers and say, \u2018Look, do I have a chance?\u2019 I think I know why I would want to run. I think I know what I think this country should do and what I would do. But I just don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s possible,\u2019 Bloomberg [said]. \u2026\n\n\u201cShould he run, Bloomberg would bring virtually limitless resources and a pragmatic governing approach to what is expected to be a massive 2020 Democratic field. \u2026 Long an active political donor to candidates in both parties, Bloomberg gave almost exclusively to Democrats this year for the first time. The decision, he explained, was born out of his concern that Republicans who controlled the House and Senate weren\u2019t providing an adequate check on the Trump presidency. Yet this political season marked a permanent shift in his political identity, he said. \u2018I will be a Democrat for the rest of my life,\u2019 Bloomberg said.\u201d\n\n-- Juli\u00e1n Castro met with donors to discuss a possible 2020 campaign. Politico\u2019s Alex Thompson reports: \u201cCastro and his twin brother, Rep. Joaquin Castro, brought together about 20 of their loyal donors and bundlers in San Antonio to begin to sketch out a national bid, according [two sources]. The session lasted several hours and invited the potential donors to ask questions about a potential presidential campaign.\u201d\n\n-- The midterm results point to Democratic hurdles as they seek to take back the White House in 2020. The New York Times\u2019s Nate Cohn writes: \u201c[Democrats\u2019] triumph was a somewhat narrow one, concentrated in well-educated, affluent communities. Over all, the distribution of Democratic and Republican support was reminiscent of the 2016 election, when Democrats won the popular vote but lost the Electoral College. Yes, Democrats can muscle their way through those disadvantages with a big enough win, like their seven-point advantage in the House popular vote. But white voters without a degree are overrepresented in the most important Midwestern battleground states. The most straightforward alternative for Democrats goes through Florida, which probably gave Republicans their most promising results last week.\u201d\n\n-- But the GOP will need to repair its relationship with suburban women to undo some of the midterm losses it sustained. Dan Balz writes: \u201cFor many suburban women \u2014 not all, by any means, but for many \u2014 Trump is toxic. It is not just that they disagree with him. \u2026 It was the president\u2019s style, his behavior, his treatment of other people, the allegations of sexual misconduct, the disrespect he has shown. \u2026 Those in the Republican Party \u2026 who worry about their deficit among suburban women cannot deny the role their president has played in creating the conditions that led to last week\u2019s results. Whether they will act on that is another question. So far it doesn\u2019t look like they are prepared to do so.\u201d\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ:\n\nTrump dismissed reports that North Korea has continued its development of ballistic missiles:\n\nThe story in the New York Times concerning North Korea developing missile bases is inaccurate.

Here\u2019s What Happened,\u201d by Jim Tankersley and Matt Phillips: \u201cEconomists across the ideological spectrum predicted the new law would fuel consumer spending, in classic fashion: When the government borrows money and dumps it into the economy, growth tends to accelerate. But Republicans did not sell the law as a sugar-high stimulus. They sold it as a refashioning of the incentives in the American economy \u2014 one that would unleash more investment, better efficiency and higher wages, along with enough growth to offset any revenue lost to the government from lower tax rates. Ten months after the law took effect, that promised \u2018supply-side\u2019 bump is harder to find than the sugar-high stimulus.\u201d\n\n-- Vanity Fair, \u201c\u2018Who Gets To Live In Victimville?\u2019: Why I Participated In A New Docuseries On The Clinton Affair,\u201d by Monica Lewinsky: \u201c[S]ociety will no doubt weigh in again on my classification\u2014Victim or Vixen?\u2014when people see a new docuseries I chose to participate in.

Didier Badjeck said Wednesday. Fighting was intense in the Mayo Binka area near Nkambe, he said. While no soldiers have been killed, he said the death toll for armed separatists may increase, as fighters escape into the bush.\n\nIn a separate incident, the mayor of Nwa, a local council in the same region, was found dead Wednesday and he is believed to have been killed by separatists, said Emmanuel Bunyui, the mayor of the nearby town of Ndu. Many mayors in English-speaking regions have been targeted by armed separatists demanding an independent English-speaking state, which they call Ambazonia.\n\n\u201cWhen we hoist the Cameroon flag in the council premises, we are targeted by the armed men who insist that we should instead display their blue and white flag,\u201d Bunyui said.\n\nThese incidents have highlighted the separatist unrest in Cameroon, which began in 2016, when English-speaking teachers and lawyers in the northwest and southwest staged demonstrations calling for reforms, criticizing what they called the marginalization of the Anglophone population, which accounts for about one-fifth of the country\u2019s 25 million people.\n\nViolence increased after factions of separatists armed themselves following a government clampdown on protests in 2017. Armed separatists have vowed to destabilize the regions and hundreds of civilians have been killed and dozens of schools have been burned and teachers threatened.\n\nIn the past year, more than 1,200 people including separatists, police, military and gendarmes have been killed in the fighting, according to military spokesman Badjeck.\n\nRecently 79 students and three staff were kidnapped from a school by suspected separatists, and they have all now been released.\n\nMore than 100 civilians have escaped the violence and fled to the capital, Yaounde.\n\n\u201cI am just going to nowhere. I am afraid,\u201d said Kenneth Kongyu, 19, who joined 75 other people who walked 60 kilometers (37 miles) for two days to escape violence in Ndu, Bunyui\u2019s town. \u201cWhen they come to the market, they shoot from every angle.\u201d\n\nTatah Oscar, 17, said he is a former fighter.

I am pleading on the government to try and solve the problem so that we the youths we can go back to school.\u201d\n\nCol. Badjeck, however, said \u201cMost of the time the terrorists operate and hide among civilians and the world has an impression that civilians are being killed, but our military is professional.\u201d\n\nIn November last year, Cameroonian President Paul Biya declared the crisis a war. Biya was re-elected to his seventh term in October, although few votes were cast in war-torn Anglophone regions.\n\nPoliticians have repeatedly called on Biya to initiate dialogue to stem the violence. The 85-year-old president, who has ruled Cameroon since 1982, has repeatedly stated that Cameroon is one and indivisible and that he is not ready to negotiate.\n\nThe conflict poses a serious challenge for Cameroon, a close U.S. security ally in combating extremism and a new member of the U.N. Human Rights Council. The United Nations have condemned both the Cameroon military and separatists for using unnecessary and excessive force and Amnesty International criticized the \u201chorrific escalation of violence\u201d in English-speaking regions.\n\nNearly a quarter-million more people have fled the ongoing violence, many leaving their homes on foot with their belongings teetering on their heads.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The agreement also promises a solution to the knotty challenge of avoiding a hard border between Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom, and the Irish Republic, which will remain in the E.U.\n\nThe plan still requires endorsement by European leaders this month, which should be relatively easy, to be followed by a far more difficult vote in December in the British Parliament, where many members decry the draft deal as a weak capitulation that satisfies no one.\n\nThe cabinet approval of May\u2019s package marked the end of a remarkable 24 hours in British politics \u2014 a true cliffhanger, with social media and the airwaves filled with speculation about whether the deal, and May herself, would survive.\n\nEven as May prepared to speak, British political reporters were tweeting that a challenge to her leadership might be underway.\n\nThe prime minister looked exhausted as she faced the cameras Wednesday evening outside her official residence.

She did not say that it would make Britain great again.\n\n\u201cI firmly believe with my head and my heart that this is a decision that is in the best interests of the entire United Kingdom,\u201d May said.\n\nThe withdrawal agreement was published shortly after she spoke \u2014 585 pages of E.U. legalese. May will discuss it in Parliament on Thursday.\n\nFor the past two years, the greatest debate over Brexit has not been waged between Brussels and London, but within May\u2019s fractious Conservative Party.\n\nHard-line Brexiteers have pushed for a decisive split from European bureaucrats and courts, from E.U. rules and regulations, while others, led by May, have sought a softer Brexit, a compromise package that keeps Britain more closely aligned with Europe to better protect the British economy.\n\nMay got a taste of the disgruntlement of her own backbench on Wednesday, as fellow Conservative Party members heaped derision on a deal that they had not yet seen \u2014 but that they feared gave too much away.\n\nConservative member of Parliament Peter Bone warned May that she was \u201cnot delivering the Brexit people voted for.\u201d He said, \u201cToday you will lose the support of many Conservative MPs and millions of voters across the country.\u201d\n\nArch-Brexiteer Boris Johnson, who quit his job as foreign secretary over May\u2019s proposals in July, had urged cabinet members to reject the agreement. \u201cIt\u2019s vassal-state stuff,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cFor the first time in 1,000 years, this place, this Parliament, will not have a say over the laws that govern this country.\u201d\n\nA Conservative member of Parliament who opposes Brexit, Anna Soubry, said Wednesday that British voters should be offered another chance to cast a ballot on whether to support May\u2019s deal or remain in the European Union.\n\nThe best deal, Soubry told the BBC, \u201cis the deal that we currently have with the European Union.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnti-Brexit demonstrators protest outside the Houses of Parliament in London on Nov. 14, 2018.

Ahead of the release of the document Wednesday, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: \u201cFrom what we know of the shambolic handling of these negotiations, this is unlikely to be a good deal for the country.\u201d\n\nOutside Parliament, Nigel Farage, a top Brexit campaigner and a member of the European Parliament, called May\u2019s withdrawal agreement \u201cthe worst deal in history.\u201d\n\nIn Europe, there was relief that May had won approval from her divided cabinet.\n\n\u201cGreen light!\u201d Danish Prime Minister Lars Loekke Rasmussen tweeted. \u201cRelieved that the UK government has now approved the deal reached by our negotiators.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis agreement is a crucial step in concluding these negotiations,\u201d said the chief E.U. Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, in a late-night news conference in the E.U. capital of Brussels, where he triumphantly waved a copy of the agreement, which he said contained 185 articles, three protocols and a series of annexes. \u201cWe\u2019re practically there.\u201d\n\nHe said European leaders had been united after what he described as Britain\u2019s \u201cthunderclap\u201d decision to leave the European Union and took pains not to inflame May\u2019s sticky political situation in London.\n\nBut he confirmed that if negotiators fail to reach a second deal about Britain\u2019s future relationship with the E.U. in the coming two years, a fail-safe, politically painful insurance policy would kick in to prevent a border from springing up between Ireland and Northern Ireland.\n\nThat insurance plan would keep Britain bound inside the E.U. customs zone, obeying E.U. customs rules and regulations but unable to shape them \u2014 the exact opposite of the stated goal of Brexit advocates. European officials say they, too, find the situation uncomfortable, since Britain would have tariff-free and quota-free access to the vast E.U. market without being subject to the same demands as other E.U. countries.\n\n\n\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May comes out to give a statement outside 10 Downing Street on Nov. 14, 2018.

Mark Sanford (R-S.C.) after he voted in Mt. Pleasant, S.C., in the June 2018 primary. (Grace Beahm Alford/The Post And Courier via AP)\n\nOpinion writer\n\nRep. Mark Sanford (R-S.C.), a rock-ribbed Republican, lost his primary to a cheerleader for President Trump. A Democrat, Joe Cunningham, then beat the Republican and flipped the seat in a major upset. Sanford writes: \u201cIn fact, there was not a more conservative district in the country to flip to the Democrats. For this reason, I think the race offers a chance for conservative soul-searching, and I say this as a committed conservative, who just happens not to be Trump enough in the age of Trump.\u201d Two of his reasons for the GOP loss, however, seem disconnected from the top election issues \u2014 Republicans\u2019 lack of concern for the environment and for fiscal responsibility. However, the third reason \u2014 Republicans\u2019 incivility \u2014 seems to be more on point. (\u201cI heard it from young soccer moms and longtime Republican voters alike. They don\u2019t want to condone behavior that is counter to what they\u2019ve taught their children.\u201d)\n\nRepublicans have witnessed so many retirements and losses that there is now a community of experienced former legislators who embody what the GOP is not \u2014 civil, thoughtful, oriented to problem-solving, opposed to the nativist turn in the GOP. They are displaced from a party that is neither conservative nor tethered to reality.\n\nSanford would do his party, state and country a service by attempting to rekindle these qualities in the GOP. He can start by primarying Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), who has decided to embrace Trump with a fervor that stuns colleagues and friends of his former ally, the late senator John McCain (R-Ariz.). Not only did Graham vote for a budget-busting tax bill, but he\u2019s also become an all-purpose apologist for Trump\u2019s lawlessness (e.g., illegally putting an unfit acting attorney general in charge of the Russia probe, undermining the credibility of elections, smearing the FBI). Sanford has the unique ability to primary him from the right while bashing him for enabling Trump.\n\nIn a similar vein, Republicans dismayed with the direction of the party should look at states where the GOP lost House seats and have a Senate race in 2020 (e.g., Iowa and Texas). It is in these states that they can fight Trump loyalists for the direction of their party. Much attention has been focused on mounting a primary (or third-party challenge) against Trump, but equally if not more important is to challenge those Senate Republicans who have become Trump enablers, refused to do rudimentary oversight, piled on as Trump has savaged democratic norms and values, and chosen to defend Trump\u2019s policy objectives (e.g., tariffs) over the economic and other interests of their home-state constituents.\n\nOne place to start would be the appointment of acting attorney general Matthew G. Whitaker. The about-to-be-out-of-work Republicans would be wise to join with Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), who presented a two-part proposal for responding to Whitaker:\n\nFirst, we are demanding that Mr. Whitaker recuse himself from the Russia investigation. On Sunday, I sent a letter along with Leader Pelosi, and top Democrats from both houses and the relevant committees, to the Department of Justice\u2019s Chief Ethics Officer explaining why Mr. Whitaker should be recused and requesting the Chief Ethics Officer notify Congress as to what guidance Whitaker has given. We\u2019ve heard that Mr. Whitaker is meeting with Ethics officials this week, and we expect, we expect, that Congress will be notified about the results of those discussions. Second, if Mr. Whitaker does not recuse himself, we Democrats are going to attempt to add legislation to the must-pass spending bill in the lame duck session that will prevent acting Attorney General Whitaker from interfering with the Mueller investigation in any way.\n\nAnd these jobless, anti-Trump Republicans shouldn\u2019t wait until 2020 to start holding fellow Republican accountable for their votes and rhetoric. Household-name Republicans should join in the fights now to protect special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, respect the sanctity of elections, challenge abuse of the pardon power and otherwise check the authoritarian tendencies of their party. They might succeed in changing the behavior of previously Trump-subservient Republicans. If not, they\u2019ll have softened incumbents up for a possible primary challenge in 2020.\n\nRead more:\n\nDan Crenshaw: SNL mocked my appearance.

In a message to viewers that accompanies the film, Anders explains that he\u2019s hopeful that the movie \u201cdoesn\u2019t pull punches.\u201d Turns out, it\u2019s a little too manipulative to be a truly honest portrayal of family.\n\nIt\u2019s ma\u00adnipu\u00adla\u00adtion, in fact, that leads the couple to adopt in the first place. Pete Wagner (Wahlberg) initially resists the suggestion by his wife, Ellie (Byrne), that they take in a foster child. But when he starts to read the stories of children who need a parent \u2014 and sees photo after photo of cute waifs \u2014 he melts.\n\nSoon the couple is off to parenting class. Unfortunately, this is where \u201cInstant Family,\u201d untrue to its name, takes a little too long to come together. The diverse class of prospective parents is a convenient way to convey inclusivity; there\u2019s a devoutly religious couple; a gay couple; a single mother looking to adopt a future star athlete.\n\nShouldn\u2019t the children\u2019s stories come first?\n\n\n\nFrom left: Octavia Spencer, Byrne, Tig Notaro and Wahlberg. (Hopper Stone/SMPSP/Paramount Pictures)\n\nThe film spends a little too much time on classes. Although these scenes offer a few choice lines of dialogue lines from parenting facilitators played by Tig Notaro and Octavia Spencer, they feel like a distraction from the Wagners\u2019 home troubles, as they take in 15-year old Lizzie (Isabela Moner) and her two younger siblings. The kids are, of course, a handful \u2014 from the accident-prone Juan (Gustavo Quiroz) to frequent tantrums thrown by Lita (Julianna Gamiz). Naturally it\u2019s the teenager who\u2019s the biggest headache, and Moner, a singer as well as an actress, turns in the movie\u2019s best performance as a character who must navigate the emotional shift from adolescent toughness to tender vulnerability.\n\nIt also takes some time for the children to warm up to their new parents, but when they eventually do, there\u2019s a predictable song cue \u2014 George Harrison\u2019s exuberant pop classic \u201cWhat is Life?\u201d \u2014 to ring in that plot development. (A more curious choice pops up in a scene featuring a sexual predator: Bauhaus\u2019s edgy 1982 cover of Brian Eno\u2019s \u201cThird Uncle.\u201d)\n\nThe movie relies heavily on metaphor. In its very first shot, the Wagners open the door to a run-down house that they plan to renovate themselves. Just in case you miss the strained symbolism, Pete later compares flipping a neglected home for a profit to fixing up an unwanted child.\n\nAnders previously directed the tasteless Adam Sandler comedy \u201cThat\u2019s My Boy\u201d and specializes in a kind of farce of the broken family. Emotionally, \u201cInstant Family\u201d is a step up from such cheaper laughs.

I\u2019m doing pretty well, despite all the anti-Semites among the German colleagues,\u201d Einstein wrote from an undisclosed location, likely as he was fleeing the country.\n\nEven though Einstein had correctly assessed the rise of anti-Semitism by the early 1920s, the scientist was wrong about the impact on his own life, repeatedly assuring his friends and colleagues that they should not worry about his safety.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me, I myself don\u2019t worry either,\u201d Einstein wrote in his letter.\n\nThe famous physicist later returned to Germany and won the Nobel Prize. But in 1933, when Einstein happened to be in the United States, Adolf Hitler took power in Germany. Einstein had to admit that he would never be able to return safely and renounced his German citizenship.\n\n\n\nA copy of a 1922 letter Albert Einstein wrote to his younger sister. (Kedem Auction House/AP)\n\nFrom the United States, Einstein continued to share his thoughts in letters that are still being widely shared. In one letter that is due to be auctioned in December, he rejected religion, writing that \u201cfor me the Jewish religion like all other religions is an incarnation of the most childish superstitions. ... [The] Jewish people to whom I gladly belong and with whose mentality I have a deep affinity have no different quality for me than all other people.\u201d\n\nEinstein\u2019s multifaceted approach toward religion and his more xenophobic and misogynistic beliefs revealed in his diaries are still the subject of debate. But his warnings against intolerance and anti-Semitism left little room for misinterpretation.\n\nAlmost a century later, Einstein\u2019s 1922 letter is not only being seen as a historical document but also as a warning that may ring true today. Its sale comes amid concerns that Jewish life is once again under attack by \u201cclassic traditional antisemitism,\u201d according to a report earlier this year by the Kantor Center for the Study of Contemporary European Jewry at Tel Aviv University. \u201cThe constant rise of the extreme right, a heated anti-Zionist discourse in the left, accompanied by harsh antisemitic expressions, and radical Islamism,\u201d they write, have caused a \u201ccertain corrosion of Jewish life.\"\n\nSince the report\u2019s release in April, anti-Semitic incidents have further increased across Europe, with a 69 percent jump in France so far this year. The spike in attacks against minorities is not limited to Jews, as Muslims have also become more frequent targets.\n\nAmid figures that indicate a shift toward more intolerance, some have searched for historical lessons that may be relevant today. Austria\u2019s national film archive, for instance, this year restored a pre-World War II silent film that sparked furious reactions in the mid-1920s for warning against the scapegoating of Jews. Long believed to be lost, \u201cThe City Without Jews\u201d was surprisingly rediscovered in a Paris flea market three years ago. The painstaking restoration took years of work.\n\n\u201cWe received enormous financial support from abroad, including from Americans following the 2016 U.S. elections,\u201d said Nikolaus Wostry, managing director of Austria\u2019s national film archive.\n\n\u201cIn today\u2019s Europe, we can clearly see the exploitation of people\u2019s fears once again. Politicians focus them on target groups \u2014 be it immigrants or followers of religions,\u201d Wostry said.\n\nAs researchers seek explanations for the recent surge in intolerance, the answers for which they are looking may also be found in documents long lost or forgotten.\n\nRead more:\n\nEinstein\u2019s letter belittling God and religion will be auctioned for $1 million or more", "\n\nThe Meatball Shop, a new addition to 14th Street, offers its signature dish on salads, in bowls, in sliders and even as \u201cballer\u201d plates.

Democrats, new and old, will be debating exactly what they should do with their newfound power to address climate change \u2014 and other issues like health care \u2014 at a time when Republicans still control the Senate and the White House\n\nThe task of managing those factions falls to Pelosi, who on Tuesday turned what could have been a tense encounter into an exchange of pleasantries. The experienced Democratic leader welcomed the protesters on Twitter while Ocasio-Cortez thanked her for doing so:\n\nThank you, @NancyPelosi.\n\n\n\nWe have 10 years left to plan and implement a Green New Deal before cataclysmic climate disaster.\n\n\n\nReinstating the Select Committee is exactly what we need to do. https://t.co/Uy5BnrLZcR \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@Ocasio2018) November 13, 2018\n\nFor the next two years, House Democrats will do what their GOP counterparts largely had refused to: debate legislation to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and adapt to warming temperatures, rising seas and their other effects.\n\nBut any bill or set of bills probably will wait until Democrats control enough levers in the federal government to actually enact legislation.\n\n\u201cWe're not trying to ramrod legislation through,\u201d said Varshini Prakash, co-founder of the environmental group Sunrise Movement, which organized the protest. \u201cWe understand that obviously with Trump in the White House and Republicans controlling the Senate there's no chance in hell\u201d their wish list becomes law.\n\nIn the meantime, the Democratic House majority will have to decide how best to highlight the climate issue with hearings and probes into the Trump administration's rollback of Obama-era environmental rules meant to address global warming.\n\n\u201cThe main priorities are infrastructure and climate change,\u201d said Rep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.), who is slated to lead the powerful House Energy and Commerce Committee. \u201cOn climate change, we're focused on holding the Trump administration accountable for things the that they are doing,\u201d including President Trump's vow to pull out of the Paris climate agreement and undo Obama-era rules on carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants.\n\nPelosi cast action on climate change as an opportunity to create jobs. \"House Democrats ran on and won on our bold campaign for a $1 trillion investment in our infrastructure that will make our communities more resilient to the climate crisis, while creating 16 million new good-paying jobs across the country,\" she said in a statement.\n\nBut the party's progressives, while acknowledging the realities of Trump's Washington, are agitating for even more aggressive legislation. Among the Sunrise Movement's demands is the creation of a select committee on climate change to spearhead legislation taking the entire nation to 100 percent renewable energy within 10 years while rapidly decarbonizing manufacturing, agriculture and other sectors of the U.S. economy. \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\n\nThey and other groups brand the plan as a \u201cGreen New Deal.\u201d\n\n\u201cScience mandates that we actually have a massive and rapid wartime economic mobilization\u201d to stop the crisis, Prakash said. She cited a recent report from a panel of international scientists describing how the world has only a dozen years to cut carbon emissions and limit global warming to moderate levels.\n\nThat United Nations report seemed to be animating many of the protesters on Tuesday, some of whom wore T-shirts with the words \"12 years\u201d to Pelosi's office.\n\nPelosi has said she \u201cstrongly\u201d supports reinstating a select climate committee, which House Republicans scrapped after they took power in 2011. But that stance alread puts Pelosi at odds with Pallone, whose committee already has jurisdiction over a wide swath of energy and environmental issues.\n\n\u201cI don't think it's necessary to have a select committee because there are already four committees that have jurisdiction over climate change, and we have climate change champions leading all these committees,\u201d Pallone said.\n\nCommittee chairmen like Pallone \u2014 including former Reps. John D. Dingell (Mich.) and Henry A. Waxman (Calif.) \u2014 have a history of bucking Pelosi's efforts to form the select committee on a subject they think their own panels can handle.\n\nAnother environmental group called the Citizens' Climate Lobby, which flooded the Capitol with 600 of its volunteers Tuesday, worries about a different cleavage: the one between Republicans and Democrats. They are concerned about Democrats using climate change to attack their GOP opponents rather than trying to work with them on the issue.\n\nDaniel Richter, the group's vice president of legislation and research, said that climate-related legislation will be durable only if it is supported by both parties.\n\n\u201cThis is too important for partisanship,\u201d he said.\n\nPOWER PLAYS\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency Building is shown in Washington.

There\u2019s been much buzz lately about how he\u2019s moving to crack down on certain electronic tobacco products that can serve as a gateway for kids to get addicted to nicotine.\n\nThe FDA is expected to announce regulations soon that make it extremely difficult for most flavored cartridge-based cigarettes to be sold in convenience stores and gas stations, as my colleague Laurie McGinley first reported last week. The agency is also mulling a first step toward banning menthol cigarettes, per the Wall Street Journal.\n\nAnd Gottlieb signaled to McGinley yesterday that the FDA is planning new regulations on flavored cigars \u2014 which, McGinley notes, could include a ban on most flavored cigars. \u201cI think you can expect us to look at pursuing action on that,\u201d he said at a Washington Post Live event:\n\nThe industry is paying close attention. Juul Labs, the company that controls more than 70 percent of the e-cigarette market, announced yesterday it would stop selling most of its flavored e-cigarette pods in convenience stores and vape shops and would halt social media promotion of the products.\n\nThe company is responsible for much of the recent spike in kids using e-cigarettes. \u201cJuul, a sleek e-cigarette introduced in 2015, has taken much of the blame for the rise in use by youths,\u201d McGinley explains. \u201cA technical and design breakthrough, the e-cigarette looks like a USB flash drive and, in a break from past vaping products, delivers high levels of nicotine that are smooth, not harsh. Each of its pods, which come in such flavors as mango and cucumber, provides as much nicotine as a pack of cigarettes.\u201d\n\nE-cigarettes present a bit of a conundrum to those seeking to help Americans stop smoking. Some advocates view them as a useful tool to help adult smokers quit more dangerous cigarettes.\n\nBut research also indicates many e-cigarette users become addicted to nicotine and eventually switch to regular cigarettes. That\u2019s troubling when you consider preliminary government data showing e-cigarette use rose 77 percent among high school students and nearly 50 percent among middle school students this year. According to that data, which McGinley cited in her piece, 3.5 million kids now engage in vaping.\n\nFDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb (Photo by Astrid Riecken For The Washington Post)\n\nThose sobering findings haven\u2019t prevented some on the right from recently criticizing Gottlieb, accusing him of enabling the kind of government \u201coverreach\u201d they would more commonly expect from a Democrat-led administration.\n\n\u201cThe FDA must stop this federal overreach in food and tobacco policy and respect personal freedom, markets and the plain language of laws,\u201d Daren Bakst, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, wrote in a piece also criticizing the FDA for implementing Obama-era menu labeling requirements.\n\nFreedomWorks, a conservative and libertarian advocacy group, blasted out a statement on Friday calling the FDA\u2019s intention to crack down on e-cigarette sales \u201ca profound disappointment\u201d and a \u201cserious step backwards\u201d from the administration\u2019s deregulating goals.\n\n\u201cCommissioner Gottlieb has tragically done a 180,\u201d said Patrick Hedger, policy director for FreedomWorks. \u201cInstead of working with industry to promote innovative and less harmful products, the FDA has continued to do nothing but smother new products and businesses in bureaucratic red tape and obstruction, emblematic of the culture in Washington that President Trump has tried to change.\u201d\n\nWhen I asked Gottlieb to respond to such criticisms, he pointed to the 2009 Tobacco Control Act and the authority it gives the FDA to try to lower smoking rates.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t just about what role government should play; this is a legal mandate,\u201d Gottlieb told me.\n\nIt's also an issue that involves kids and their potential for becoming addicted to a chemical (nicotine) that could one day take their lives.\n\n\u201cI must have said dozens of times \u2026that allowing e-cigarettes to continue on the market could not come at the expense of addicting a whole generation of kids to these products,\u201d Gottlieb said.\n\nSally Satel, a lecturer at Yale University and resident at AEI, where she worked with Gottlieb, said she thinks the FDA chief is under tremendous pressure by Congress to do something about the growing use of electronic tobacco products among children \u2014 and thinks he is doing the best he can.\n\n\u201cAdult access should not come at the expense of children, but there has to be a way to negotiate that tradeoff, and he\u2019s trying, I think, under the circumstances,\u201d Satel said.\n\nAHH, OOF and OUCH\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services building is seen in Washington.

The goal is to reduce the obstacles people face in trying to get the lifesaving medication.\u201d\n\nJourdan stretches his arms with his mother, Chelsi, as part of his daily physical therapy.

While experts across the United States have \u201craced to understand the disease,\u201d the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has announced a new task force that will study the disease and look into potential new leads into what exactly is going on.\n\n\u201cIn the meantime, parents of sick children are growing increasingly frustrated, \u201c Sun writes. \u201cCompeting theories have emerged about what triggers AFM; without clear guidance, doctors are trying several different kinds of treatment. While some children have seen improvement, so far no treatment has been found to lead reliably to full recovery. Many will need intensive physical therapy for years. Some need a ventilator to help them breathe.\u201d\n\nThere have been at least 90 cases of AFM confirmed this year in 27 states, and there are 162 more cases still under investigation. \u201cA few weeks ago, the CDC began reporting the larger number of suspected cases alongside confirmed ones to alert both parents and physicians to the latest spike,\u201d Lena reports, and the agency said Tuesday it will \u201ctrack the long-term outcomes of all AFM cases for this year and previous years.\u201d\n\nMichelle Melicosta, a pediatrician at the Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore, told Lena, \"It\u2019s not that often we\u2019re faced with something we\u2019re still learning about \u2026 We just don\u2019t always have the answer we wish we had.

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\n\n\u2014 HHS Secretary Alex Azar said the Trump administration will allow states more flexibility to expand inpatient mental health treatment.\n\nIn a speech to Medicaid directors, Azar said the administration would allow states to apply for waivers to have Medicaid pay for mental health treatment at inpatient facilities. Current federal law, known as the \u201cIMD exclusion,\" prohibits Medicaid from paying for such treatment in facilities with more than 16 beds. The decades-old exclusion was originally intended to help move mental health patients into community-based treatment settings, but is now considered to be a hamper on treatment.\n\n\u201cDifferent forms of treatment work for different patients, but the decades-old restriction on Medicaid reimbursement for inpatient treatment at institutions for mental diseases, or IMDs, has been a significant barrier,\u201d Azar said Tuesday.\n\nAzar said the Trump administration has approved 13 of these waivers and more are in the works.\n\nScott Lloyd, director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement at the Department of Health and Human Services, testifies during a House Judiciary Committee hearing concerning the oversight of the U.S. refugee admissions program, on Capitol Hill.

Kudlow said Navarro was \u201cway off base,\u201d \u201cfreelancing,\u201d and \u201cnot representing the president or the administration,\u201d when he warned unnamed financiers to stay away from U.S.-China trade talks.\n\nNavarro, in a fiery Friday speech at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, accused unnamed people of acting as \u201cunpaid foreign agents,\u201d trying to put \u201cthe imprimatur of Goldman Sachs and Wall Street\u201d on a deal between the superpowers (see the full address here). Kudlow responded in a CNBC interview Tuesday, saying Navarro was \u201cnot authorized by anybody\u201d to make those remarks and adding they had done \u201ca great disservice\u201d to the president.\n\nThe clash comes as the Trump administration is reengaging with Beijing ahead of a meeting this month between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G-20 summit in Buenos Aires. That huddle likely provides the last best hope for heading off a dramatic escalation of the trade conflict. Barring a breakthrough, Trump has threatened to levy tariffs on the remaining $267 billion in Chinese imports \u2014 and 10 percent duties that are in place on $200 billion of Chinese goods are set to climb to 25 percent at the start of next year.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin talked trade by phone on Friday with his Chinese counterpart, Vice Premier Liu He, the Wall Street Journal reported. That conversation followed one this month between Trump and Xi. And Kudlow told reporters yesterday the U.S. and Chinese governments are now \u201ccommunicating at all levels and that\u2019s a very good thing.\u201d Ahead of the G-20 meeting, he said the administration is working on \u201cbackground materials in preparation and we\u2019re waiting for China to come back with some thoughts.\u201d\n\nVice President Pence, meanwhile, tells The Post\u2019s Josh Rogin that Xi will need to pledge massive changes to secure a deal. Per Josh, \u201cIn addition to trade, Pence said China must offer concessions on several issues, including but not limited to its rampant intellectual property theft, forced technology transfer, restricted access to Chinese markets, respect for international rules and norms, efforts to limit freedom of navigation in international waters and Chinese Communist Party interference in the politics of Western countries.\u201d\n\nThe big question hanging over the conflict remains what kind of deal Trump will accept. And the Kudlow-Navarro spat appears to offer China watchers some fresh clues.\n\nNavarro\u2019s speech \u201cwas a clear tip-off that a deal is in the works,\u201d says Fred Bergsten, the founding director of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want a deal, so he\u2019s going public with his complaints about it.\u201d\n\nWhite House National Trade Council Director Peter Navarro. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\nSome aren\u2019t convinced. Another person close to the process noted Trump has been talking up his nationalist bona fides recently: \u201cHe may be saying to the free traders, \u2018Go bring me a deal, while also saying to the other faction, 'Give me some tariffs. Help me ensure the Chinese pay a price for pillaging and plundering.\u2019 I think they coexist.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. and China last arrived at such a potentially decisive moment in May, when Mnuchin negotiated a deal with Liu that Trump ultimately rejected, heeding his hawks, including Navarro and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at a similar intersection,\u201d says Scott Kennedy, director of the Project on Chinese Business and Political Economy at CSIS. \u201cThe two presidents meeting at the G-20 is the next opportunity for them to find a potential resolution, limited or larger, so there\u2019s been a lot of lobbying inside and outside the administration to suggest even a limited deal, like a freeze of further hostilities, is warranted. We\u2019re seeing the consequences of that effort in the sparring back and forth in public.\u201d\n\nThat lobbying has included cameo appearances by former treasury secretary Hank Paulson and former secretary of state Henry Kissinger. Paulson, the former Goldman Sachs CEO, warned in a speech in Singapore last week that an \u201ceconomic iron curtain\u201d threatens to divide the world if the U.S. and China can\u2019t resolve their differences; Kissinger, at the same conference, said \u201cfundamental conflict\u201d between the countries \u201cwill destroy hope for the world order.\u201d Both have met with Chinese leaders in the past two weeks, the Journal reports.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear who Navarro had in mind when he called out Wall Streeters. But Blackstone Group CEO Stephen Schwarzman, \u201cwho has one of the closest relationships to Beijing of any American executive, is in many ways the president\u2019s de facto China whisperer,\u201d The Washington Post\u2019s Michael Kranish reported in March. Schwarzman, he wrote, helped \u201cpersuade the man who said Beijing\u2019s leaders were \u2018raping\u2019 the United States not to follow through on a campaign promise to declare China a \u2018currency manipulator.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe divisions aren\u2019t new: Navarro and Mnuchin had an \u201cexpletive-packed shouting match\u201d in Beijing back in May after Navarro complained he was being excluded from meetings with Chinese leaders, The Post reported at the time.\n\nBut the tensions are spilling back into the open at a critical moment. If Trump and Xi can\u2019t strike a deal, they may not get another chance to hash one out in person until the next G-20 summit in Osaka, in late June.\n\nMARKET MOVERS\n\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May.

According to Daniel Sharp, the Meatball Shop\u2019s director of culinary operations, it\u2019s all about achieving a perfect balance of flavor and texture. \u201cThe mistake people make is that they try to make meatballs out of ingredients that [don\u2019t lend themselves] to meatballs. They try to remove the \u2019filler,\u2019 but that\u2019s what gives [the meatballs] a lighter texture.

(Elaine Thompson/AP)\n\nA New Hampshire judge\u2019s attempt to compel Amazon to share recordings from an Echo device at the scene of an alleged double murder is putting a fine point on law enforcement\u2019s growing demand for data from Internet of Things devices.\n\nProsecutors are seeking two days of recordings from the smart speaker in a Farmington, N.H., home where two women were found dead in January 2017, according to a report from CBS Boston. The judge directed the company to turn over evidence in the case, but so far, Amazon has said it \u201cwill not release customer data without a valid and binding legal demand properly served on us.\"\n\nAs more devices such as voice assistants, home security cameras, appliances and even doorbells come online, the trove of intimate data that technology companies hold is increasing exponentially. People are voluntarily bringing in devices that record their conversations, track their heart rates, and comings-and-goings -- all of which produces more intimate and real-time potential evidence that law enforcement might want to help solve crimes.\n\nBut as the companies battle backlash over privacy concerns, there's an incentive for technology companies to protect this data from anyone other than the customer. Expect the showdown between law enforcement and companies to continue to play out the courts.\n\n\u201cAmazon objects to overbroad or otherwise inappropriate demands as a matter of course,\u201d an Amazon spokeswoman told me regarding the New Hampshire case. (Amazon.com founder and chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\n\nProsecutors in that case are trying to piece together the sequence of events that led to the deaths of two women sometime between January 27 and 29, 2017. Their bodies were found under the porch of a home with stab wounds, according to reports. Investigators believe one woman was attacked in the kitchen where an Echo device was located, and \"prosecutors believe there is probable cause to believe there is evidence on the Echo, such as audio recordings of the attack and events that followed it,\u201d according to court documents obtained by CBS.\n\nInvestigators think essential evidence to the case could be on Amazon\u2019s servers, where it stores recordings of customer interactions with the device after they use a \u201cwake word\u201d that alerts the device a command is coming.\n\nDevices such as the Amazon Echo and the Google Home are only supposed to record when they hear command words, such as the word \u201cAlexa\u201d or \u201cHey, Google.\u201d But sometimes the devices can misinterpret a wake word and start recording anyway, as was the case in Oregon this year, when an Echo device inadvertently recorded a family\u2019s conversation and sent it to one of their contacts.\n\nElectronic Frontier Foundation Senior Staff Attorney Nate Cardozo said law enforcement has long asked technology companies to turn over data from connected devices. Such requests date back to at least the early 2000s, when law enforcement tried to surveil via car assistance programs. But it\u2019s happening with greater frequency as the number of IoT devices in consumers\u2019 homes explodes. \u201cNow that everything has a microphone or a sensor,\u201d Cardozo said, \u201cthe amount of data is just so many orders of magnitude greater.\u201d\n\nResearch firm Gartner predicts there will be 20.4 billion IoT devices by 2020. That\u2019s a significant uptick from the 11.2 billion connected devices Gartner forecasts will be in use in 2018.\n\nAmazon resisted a previous attempt to gain recordings from an Alexa device. Last year, prosecutors in Arkansas issued a warrant calling on Amazon to turn over recordings in another murder trial. The company fought the warrant, saying user conversations were protected under the First Amendment. The company eventually turned over the recordings with the permission of the device\u2019s owner.\n\nLaw enforcement\u2019s embrace of the Internet of Things has also included fitness trackers. Earlier this year, the New York Times reported that police used Fitbit data to charge a 90-year-old man in the slaying of his stepdaughter. The device showed the victim\u2019s heart rate spiked significantly after the man arrived at her house and then stopped shortly before he left. Fitbit declined to comment on the New York Times piece, referring the reporter to its privacy policy, where it says it complies with legal processes when it shares data. Fitness tracker data has also been used to solve cases of sexual assault.\n\nAnd it's not only local law enforcement that is seeking to leverage Internet of Things devices. Two years ago, Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper Jr. said the intelligence community could use smart home devices for investigations.\n\n\u201cIn the future, intelligence services might use the [internet of things] for identification, surveillance, monitoring, location tracking, and targeting for recruitment, or to gain access to networks or user credentials,\u201d the Guardian reported Clapper said at the time.\n\nPINGED, PATCHED, PWNED\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen speaks during a news briefing at the White House in Washington on April 4.

Samantha Ravich of the FDD stressed the importance of including businesses in the exercise since they are prime targets for cyberattacks, Lyngaas reported. \u201cThere was \u2018a good, robust discussion\u2019 on the value of spending limited company resources on helping the government trace the origin of an attack, Ravich said,\u201d according to CyberScoop. \u201cKnowing which foreign government is behind an intrusion can help a company prepare for future activity, she added.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Nearly half of respondents in a study on cybersecurity threats to small and medium businesses said they have \u201cno understanding of how to protect against\u201d cyberattacks.

(Jim Morrison for The Washington Post)\n\nAs many have reported by now, the 2018 midterm elections included a record number of female veteran candidates \u2014 candidates who won their races at higher rates than did non-incumbent male veterans. In general, the number of lawmakers who are military vets has been declining for years . But in the 116th Congress, the number of female veterans in Congress will rise from four to at least five \u2014 and could go as high as six, depending on the final results in the race of former Air Force captain Gina Ortiz Jones , a Democrat running for the House in Texas\u2019s 23rd District.\n\n[Having fewer veterans in Congress makes it less likely to restrain the president\u2019s use of force]\n\nHere\u2019s how female veterans did in the midterms\n\nOf the unprecedented 14 female veterans on the ballot, three were Republicans and 11 Democrats. None were incumbents, with the exception of Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii), who won reelection. Of those who were not incumbents, only two ran for open seats that had previously been held by a member of their party: Martha McSally, who ran for Jeff Flake\u2019s Arizona Senate seat, and Wendy Rogers, a Republican running for the House, also in Arizona, both of whom lost. Another ran in a newly drawn district: Chrissy Houlahan, who ran for the House as a Democrat in Pennsylvania, against an incumbent member of Congress.\n\nFour Democrats won their elections, flipping three districts.\n\nFemale veterans who were not incumbents have won 23 percent of their races so far; if Jones wins, this will increase to 30 percent. Male veterans who were not incumbents have won just 14 percent of their races, with three still undecided. If each of the remaining seats goes to a veteran candidate, male non-incumbent veterans\u2019 success rate will rise to 17 percent.\n\n[Was it a \u2018blue wave\u2019 or not? That depends on how you define a \u2018wave.\u2019]\n\nThat success rate is a big change from female veterans\u2019 past record\n\nThe first female veteran who made it to Capitol Hill was Catherine Small Long (D-La.) after winning a special election in 1985. 1998 was the first year a female veteran won in a regular election: Heather Wilson (R-N.M.), now serving as secretary of the Air Force.\n\nSince then, a handful of notable candidates have won \u2014 but as is typical for challengers, most have lost, Republicans and Democrats alike. From 2004 through 2016, Republicans nominated 10 veteran women (we exclude California, Louisiana and Washington, which use nonpartisan primaries). The two GOP winners were Wilson and McSally. During the same time, Democrats nominated 18; again, only two won \u2014 Gabbard and Illinois Sen. Tammy Duckworth, who served in the House before winning her Senate race.\n\nEarly in 2018, it became clear that things would be different for female veterans. When Amy McGrath entered the race for Kentucky\u2019s 6th District, she was not favored to win even the Democratic primary. But her first advertisement , featuring the story of how she became the \u201cfirst female Marine to fly in an F-18 in combat,\u201d went viral, earning $300,000 within 72 hours. Fulsome media coverage of her and the other female veterans followed.\n\n[These 5 charts explain who voted how in the 2018 midterm election]\n\nWhy were Democratic veteran women so successful in 2018?\n\nIn all, Democrats nominated about as many female veterans this year as Republicans have ever nominated \u2014 but just nominating veteran women isn\u2019t enough to get them into office. Over the past 10 years, veteran women have run as Democrats in districts that, on average, were harder to win than the districts in which Democratic non-veteran women were running. Between 2004 and 2016, female veterans ran in districts where the baseline partisanship \u2014 a term meaning the average Democratic share of the vote in the previous presidential election \u2014 was 39 percent, making them look a bit like sacrificial lambs. In 2018, this figure was 46 percent . In other words, this year more veteran women were running in districts that were winnable.\n\nFurther, voters believe veterans are better able to handle national defense than others. However, as noted above, the overall share of veterans in Congress is declining . The intersection of gender and defense may have opened doors for Democrats.\n\nThat\u2019s because when female veterans run for office, they benefit from both high levels of trust in the military and the typical advantages of running as a woman \u2014 being perceived as less corrupt , more empathetic and more competent on such domestic issues as poverty \u2014 without the risk of being seen as too weak . They may be able to appeal across party lines in a way that male veterans and women who have not served in the military do not.\n\nThere are additional advantages for female veterans who run as Democrats. When veterans run as Democrats, they challenge the general perception that Republicans are more trustworthy on military and defense issues. Female veterans may appeal to voters because they are women who have excelled in a field that is male-dominated \u2014 and because independents and Republicans can interpret \u201cveteran\u201d as an indicator of patriotism and conservatism at a time when the president refers to Democrats as \u201ctreasonous\u201d and \u201cun-American.\u201d\n\nFemale veterans in this cycle may also have served as a symbolic antidote to President Trump, even more than female candidates in general did. The party opposed to the president generally picks up seats in the midterms. But even given that, women who volunteered for combat offered a clear contrast to a man who took five wartime draft deferments . And as women, they could still implicitly rebuke the president\u2019s \u201c locker room banter \u201d that outraged so many women.\n\nThese female veterans are a subset of a large influx of women into Congress two years into the Trump presidency. While they should be seen as a part of this group , they share an experience common to only a small subset of the population. Many have framed their candidacies as continuations of their service .\n\nRebecca Best (@RebeccaBestIR) is assistant professor of political science at University of Missouri in Kansas City.", "\n\nMaryland is challenging the appointment of Matthew G.

(Win McNamee/Getty Images)\n\nThomas Homan, a tough-talking former Trump administration immigration official who has been touted as a possible replacement for Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, offered nothing but praise Wednesday for the current occupant of the job.\n\nThe Washington Post reported this week that President Trump has told advisers he has decided to remove Nielsen, in part because of what he views as her lackluster performance on immigration enforcement and that he is looking for someone to more forcefully implement his agenda.\n\nHoman, a former acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement who appears regularly on Fox News, said during an interview with the network that he considers Nielsen \u201ca strong secretary.\u201d\n\n[Trump is preparing to remove Kirstjen Nielsen as Homeland Security secretary, aides say]\n\n\u201cWith immigration, you know, 50 percent of America hates you 100 percent of the time,\u201d Homan said on \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t win on this topic because it\u2019s so divisive, so controversial, so emotional, but I think she\u2019s working hard and doing a good job.\u201d\n\nHoman, a former police officer and Border Patrol agent, said his phone \u201cblew up\u201d amid reports that Trump is planning to replace Nielsen. But he would not speculate about what the president might do.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve got a secretary in place; I think we need to support her,\u201d Homan said. \u201cShe was asked to step up. She grabbed the bat and stepped up to the plate. So all these people want to attack her all the time and attack this administration. I don\u2019t see them stepping up to the plate.\u201d\n\nNielsen has been reluctant to leave the administration before reaching her one-year mark as secretary on Dec. 6, but she has been unhappy in the job for several months, according to colleagues. Trump has berated her during Cabinet meetings, belittled her to other White House staff and tagged her months ago as a \u201cBushie.\u201d The reference to her previous service under President George W. Bush was apparently meant to cast suspicion on her loyalty.\n\nWhen Nielsen has tried to explain the laws and regulations that prevent the government from drastically curtailing immigration or closing the border with Mexico, as Trump has suggested, the president has grown impatient and frustrated, aides said.\n\nNielsen\u2019s departure would leave a leadership void at the government\u2019s third-largest agency, which has 240,000 employees and a $60 billion budget. The deputy secretary job at DHS has been vacant since April, and the White House has not submitted to Congress a nomination for that post.\n\nNick Miroff, Josh Dawsey and Philip Rucker contributed to this report.", "She is the successor of Angela Merkel\u2019s dreams, one who must remind the German chancellor of a younger version of herself.\n\nA chronically underestimated woman in a male-dominated field. A listener rather than a grandstander. A builder of consensus at a time of polarization.\n\nAnnegret Kramp-Karrenbauer\u2019s greatest asset as she positions herself to become Germany\u2019s next leader is that she is widely regarded as Merkel\u2019s choice for the job. That is also her biggest liability.\n\nThe race to be crowned chancellor-in-waiting will culminate early next month in a vote at the ruling Christian Democratic Union\u2019s annual convention. It is fast shaping up as a referendum on Merkel\u2019s 13-year run, with the chancellor\u2019s legacy and the direction of Europe\u2019s largest economy on the line.\n\nIf Kramp-Karrenbauer is chosen, Merkelism will live on in Germany and Merkel will have a shot at an exit that is gradual and graceful, potentially finishing her full fourth term as chancellor before retiring in 2021.\n\nBut success for either of the other main contenders would set Germany on a different course: an end to Merkel-style moderation in favor of ideologically committed conservatism, and a potentially messy ejection of the woman who has been one of Europe\u2019s most consequential modern leaders.\n\nIt is not clear which way the party\u2019s 1,001 delegates will swing. Merkel long held unquestioned dominance of the CDU. But that has crumbled amid backlash to her 2015 decision to allow in more than 1 million asylum seekers.\n\nWith the party\u2019s poll numbers sagging and internal discontent brewing, Merkel announced late last month that she would not run for another term as the party\u2019s leader. Along with Kramp Karrenbauer, two Merkel critics from the party\u2019s right flank \u2014 former CDU parliamentary leader Friedrich Merz and Health Minister Jens Spahn \u2014 quickly jumped into a race that is highly likely, although not certain, to determine who will lead Germany.\n\nMerkel, 64, has not officially endorsed a candidate. But Kramp-Karrenbauer, 56 \u2014 whose tongue-twister of a name, even for Germans, often yields to the simpler AKK or \u201cmini-Merkel\u201d \u2014 is widely perceived to be the chancellor\u2019s pick. Merkel named her the party\u2019s general secretary in the spring, the same position that began her own rise to the top.\n\nMerkel\u2019s blessing is, even supporters concede, a mixed one.\n\n\u201cPeople who basically want continuity but with a different face will choose Annegret,\u201d said Karl Rauber, a close ally of Kramp-Karrenbauer\u2019s within the CDU who has known her for decades. \u201cThe problem is that people don\u2019t want things to continue as they are. They want changes.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe candidates for Christian Democratic Union leadership \u2014 Jens Spahn, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer and Friedrich Merz \u2014 arrive for a media statement in Berlin on Nov. 9. (Clemens Bilan/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)\n\nPolls of CDU members show Merz and Kramp-Karrenbauer running neck and neck, with Spahn a distant third.\n\nLaunching her campaign last week in Berlin, Kramp-Karrenbauer declared the \u201cend of an era\u201d defined by Merkel \u2014 and walked a characteristically pragmatic line in her pitch for how to follow it.\n\n\u201cSuch an era cannot be simply continued or reversed,\u201d she said. \u201cThe decisive question is what you do with what you have inherited.\u201d\n\nShould Kramp-Karrenbauer win the CDU vote, it would cap a rise nearly as unlikely as Merkel\u2019s head-spinning ascent from unknown East German physicist to leader of Germany\u2019s dominant postwar party in just 10 years.\n\nKramp-Karrenbauer has had little experience in the rough-and-tumble of German national politics. Instead, she has forged nearly her entire career in the tiny western region of Saarland, which both literally and figuratively sits about as far as one can get in Germany from Berlin. With just 1 million people, it is the country\u2019s second smallest state. Even its biggest city, Saarbr\u00fccken, has the coziness of a remote provincial capital \u2014 which is exactly what it is.\n\n\u201cCan she handle the transition from the Saarland stage to the Berlin stage?\u201d said Daniel Kirch, chief political correspondent at the region\u2019s major newspaper, the Saarbr\u00fccker Zeitung. \u201cThat\u2019s the million-dollar question.\u201d\n\nWithin Saarland, where she served for seven years as state premier, she has legions of admirers and few enemies. Even her political opponents credit her with a consensual style of governance.\n\nStill, few say they ever regarded her as someone with the makings of a future chancellor.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s very humble and very nice and you wouldn\u2019t necessarily think she\u2019s ambitious,\u201d Kirch said. \u201cBut you don\u2019t get to where she is without being very ambitious.\u201d\n\nThe second-youngest among seven siblings, Kramp-Karrenbauer grew up in P\u00fcttlingen, a modest city near the French border that was hard-hit in her youth by the closure of coal mines where her ancestors had toiled for generations.\n\nThe family was devoutly Catholic and conservative. Her mother managed the home while her father served as principal at a school for children with developmental disabilities. (Merkel\u2019s father was a Lutheran pastor at a home for the disabled.)\n\nKramp-Karrenbauer would passionately debate politics with her father, although she shared many of his views, said Hans-Guenther Kramp, an older brother. She was studious and sang in the church choir \u2014 while dabbling in a taste for slightly harder-edged music, including metal band AC/DC.\n\n\u201cShe would fight with our younger brother about whose band was the best,\u201d said Kramp, who, like three of his four surviving siblings, still lives in P\u00fcttlingen. \u201cBut she would always let him finish his arguments before it was decided that both bands were equally good.\n\n\u201cShe does this in politics, too. It\u2019s her virtue.\u201d\n\nShe also can be resolute when principle is at stake, say those who have known her longest.\n\nWhen the local branch of the German Communist Party invited a Soviet official to P\u00fcttlingen\u2019s city hall in the late 1970s, Kramp-Karrenbauer and fellow young CDU activists built a Berlin Wall replica in front of the building \u2014 forcing the official into an embarrassing maneuver around it on his way inside, said Rudolf M\u00fcller, a former mayor.\n\nAs a young woman on P\u00fcttlingen\u2019s city council, Kramp-Karrenbauer was initially greeted with skepticism in a chamber dominated by older men, M\u00fcller said. But she won them over, pushing through a highly successful program to help laid-off workers.\n\n\u201cShe really listened, and only spoke when she had something to say,\u201d said M\u00fcller, who led the city for 27 years. \u201cIt took time to convince them, but she did.\u201d\n\nIn a conservative party, some were still thrown by how she balanced the demands of her career and motherhood. She accepted an interim appointment to the German parliament only days after one of her sons was born and appeared at debates with a baby in her arms. Her husband, a mining engineer, took leave from his job to care for their three children.\n\nPetra Berg, a leader of the center-left Social Democrats in Saarland, said Kramp-Karrenbauer was not taken as seriously as she should have been by male rivals. Merkel must also know that feeling. But Berg said the similarities between the two go far beyond gender.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too simplistic to say they have a connection because they\u2019re both women,\u201d she said. \u201cThe fact is, they have very similar personalities. That\u2019s what ties them.\u201d\n\nLike Merkel, Kramp-Karrenbauer is reluctant to rush into a decision, preferring to wait until she has considered all available data and spoken with everyone involved.\n\nIt is an approach that has served her well in Saarland, where one of her first tasks after rising to premier was to trim 10 percent from a cash-strapped state budget.\n\nWhat might have been political poison became the path to a pair of decisive reelection victories, with Kramp-Karrenbauer convening roundtable meetings to agree collectively on how to mete out the cuts. Participants credited her with a process that was fair, even when it was painful.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s not like other politicians in those situations. She\u2019s very clear,\u201d said Volker Linneweber, a former president of the University of Saarland. \u201cShe told me, \u2018I don\u2019t promise anything I can\u2019t deliver.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAlthough Kramp-Karrenbauer is on the left of her party economically, she has appealed to the right on cultural issues.

A total of 91 migrants, including a baby, were rescued by the ship\u2019s crew last weekend after leaving Libya in a raft. (Associated Press)\n\nDozens of migrants have barricaded themselves in a container ship in the Libyan port city of Misrata for the past five days after being picked up at sea, and refuse to disembark, saying Libya is too dangerous for them.\n\nLoaded with cars, the ship Nivin was already bound for Misrata when it picked up 93 migrants in a foundering raft in the Mediterranean Sea late on Friday and continued toward its destination. They have been in the Misrata port ever since, with the captain and crew taking refuge on the upper decks.\n\nBy late Wednesday, at least 77 remained on board after more than a dozen of the migrants agreed to leave with the Libyan coast guard for a nearby detention center \u2014 including a woman and her infant. The others refused, saying Libya was deadly for migrants and they wanted to go to Europe.\n\nOne of the migrants, a man from South Sudan reached by The Associated Press on the ship, vowed on Wednesday to reach Europe or die trying. He said six commercial ships passed his group before the Nivin finally stopped.\n\nLibya\u2019s coast guard had no immediate comment on the situation.\n\nWith just one rescue ship patrolling the Mediterranean, and European ports refusing to take in rescued migrants, commercial ships have become increasingly leery of picking up people in the sea. Repeatedly in recent months, they have found themselves caught in the middle between governments hostile to new migrants and an obligation under international maritime law to save\n\nThe man, who identified himself only by his name, Victor, fearing for his safety, said he himself had already been imprisoned repeatedly in Libya and that his own brother had died there. He had no intention of returning, he said.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to go out in Libya,\u201d he told The Associated Press. \u201cYou can come and take my dead body outside.\u201d\n\nJulien Raickman, who is the head of the Doctors Without Borders mission in Libya, said Europe\u2019s policy of refusing to take in rescued migrants has led to a spike in deaths. Now one in five who cross perishes at sea, he said.\n\nRaickman said the Libyan coast guard has given international organizations access to the migrants, who have food and some degree of medical care now, but no toilets or other sanitary facilities. The ship\u2019s cargo of cars was peacefully unloaded, but the migrants remained unmoved.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re afraid that this dispute will end in violence. The people who are on board are determined.

(AP Photo/Brynn Anderson)\n\nIt\u2019s been a week since Election Day, and we\u2019re still awaiting results from Florida and Georgia, where nationally prominent races are too close to call.\n\nSince Election Day, an additional 50,000 votes have been counted in Florida, narrowing the lead for Republican Gov. Rick Scott over Democrat Sen. Bill Nelson in the Senate race, and for Republican Ron DeSantis over Democrat Andrew Gillum in the gubernatorial contest. Both races are headed to a recount. In Georgia, nearly 150,000 votes have been added to the election night tally, cutting the lead of Republican Brian Kemp in half over Democrat Stacey Abrams in the contest for governor. That contest, too, may be headed for a recount.\n\nAcross the country, in Arizona, a close-but-comfortable election night lead for Republican senatorial candidate Martha McSally was transformed a week later into a victory for her Democratic opponent, Kyrsten Sinema, as an additional 800,000 ballots were counted, and the results flipped.\n\nThis slow process of counting ballots has produced considerable controversy. But it shouldn\u2019t. Both state laws and sheer logistics make it impossible to finish counting ballots on election night or even within a day or two. Here\u2019s why that is \u2014 and why newly counted ballots seem to favor Democratic candidates.\n\nWhy the counting isn\u2019t done on election night\n\nThe election night tradition of gathering around the television to see the votes come in and news organizations \u201ccall\u201d the winners gives us a false impression: All the votes that need to be counted can, and should, be tallied in the minutes after the close of polls.\n\nBut this is wrong. For one, in almost every state, provisional ballots will have been cast on Election Day by voters whose registration cannot be verified. In 2016, 2.1 million voters cast a provisional ballot, 71 percent of which were eventually counted after the registration was verified. States are currently in the middle of verifying the registration status of those who cast provisional ballots in 2018, and decisions are being made about whether to count those ballots in this election. Moreover, millions of ballots have been mailed in, which now need to be opened, have voters\u2019 signatures compared to the signature on record and then scanned.\n\n[Was it a \u2018blue wave\u2019 or not? That depends on how you define a \u2018wave.\u2019]\n\nIn some states, this means that a large number of votes are counted after Election Day. In 2016, California and Washington counted less than half their votes within a day of the election. Three other states, Alaska, Arizona and Utah counted only about 60 percent. Another six states had counted only 90 percent of their ballots.\n\nIn Arizona, ballot-counting takes extra time because three-quarters of Arizona\u2019s voters cast ballots by mail. Many of these are returned in person on Election Day. Processing mail ballots is labor-intensive and can take days if not weeks to complete. Arizona also has a relatively large percentage of provisional ballots \u2014 almost 4 percent of all ballots in 2016 \u2014 and those ballots must also be painstakingly processed.\n\nIn Florida, the situation is different. Florida actually tends to have a small number of ballots to be counted after Election Day. In 2016, nearly 98 percent of all ballots were counted on either Election Day or the day after. The same pattern is repeating in 2018. Most of Florida\u2019s absentee ballots arrive before Election Day. State law allows counties to tally absentee ballots \u2014 and keep the results quarantined \u2014 which speeds up the count.\n\nFlorida law does prohibit its large number of early votes from being tabulated before the polls close on Election Day. However, it is clear that almost all counties have organized themselves in such a way that they can get the early-vote count completed within hours of the polls closing. Broward and Palm Beach Counties have not chosen to do this, but they are acting within the discretion given under Florida law.\n\nWhy do the newly counted ballots favor Democrats?\n\nSince the 2000 presidential election, the post-election-night vote count has favored Democratic candidates in most states. This pattern was first identified by Ohio State University law professor Edward B. Foley, who called it the \u201cblue shift.\u201d\n\n[The blue wave was big \u2014 and significant \u2014 in state legislatures]\n\nThe blue shift was evident in 2016. On the Wednesday after Election Day, 124 million ballots had been counted, and Hillary Clinton led Donald Trump in the national popular vote by only 0.2 percentage points. But as an additional 13 million ballots were counted, Clinton\u2019s lead widened to about 2 points. The blue shift happened in most states, as well \u2014 although Clinton\u2019s lead in Washington state actually shrank by over 3 points as all the ballots were counted.\n\nThere are two reasons the blue shift exists and has become more prominent. First, the 2002 Help America Vote Act required states to institute provisional ballots for voters with a disputed registration status when they went to vote. Because voters who cast a provisional vote are more likely to be young and members of a racial or ethnic minority group, provisional ballots are disproportionately Democratic.\n\nSecond, Democrats are slightly more likely to vote by mail than Republicans. This is probably because Democratic campaigns are more likely to emphasize turning out supporters before Election Day than are Republican campaigns. Thus as these mail ballots are counted, the overall total will again lean Democratic.\n\nWhat\u2019s happened in Florida and Arizona is nothing new. In fact, it\u2019s entirely consistent with current trends in election law and election administration. Voters across the United States have demanded greater flexibility in how and when they cast their ballots. This greater flexibility comes with a price: a delay in counting ballots.\n\n[These 5 charts explain who voted how in the 2018 midterm election]\n\nOf course, one must guard against shenanigans that could occur during the counting of these additional ballots.\n\nBut to date, nothing about the vote-counting in Arizona and Florida suggests that the growing number of votes or their Democratic tilt are due to electoral improprieties.\n\nCharles Stewart III is the Kenan Sahin distinguished professor of political science at MIT and director of the MIT Election Data and Science Lab.", "\n\nChrystal Prue, 40, from Ft. Washington, Md., winds yarn with a swift and ball-winder at Looped Yarn Works, a knitting store in Washington, D.C., on Nov. 13. (Lexey Swall/FTWP)\n\nWhen she visited Ravelry.com, a pattern-sharing and social-media website known as the \u201cFacebook of knitting,\u201d MIT PhD candidate Hyejun Kim realized she was watching the journey from hobbyist to entrepreneur happen in real time. With data.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s impossible not to study this,\u201d she thought.\n\nKim\u2019s resulting analysis sheds light on the hard-to-measure early stages of entrepreneurship, and the social and economic forces that cause someone to flip the switch from \u201cfun\u201d to \u201cprofit.\u201d\n\nShe analyzed almost 100 interviews and 403,168 profiles of knitters and crocheters in the United States. She found that even on one of the Internet\u2019s great niche social networks, offline encouragement and feedback helped most talented hobbyists recognize their ability and take the first steps toward monetizing it. Success on the Internet was propelled by real-life interactions.\n\nHer work was brought to our attention via an enthusiastic endorsement from trendsetting blogger and George Mason University economist Tyler Cowen.\n\nKim, who tried to knit but never got the hang of it, calculates that about 96 percent of Ravelry\u2019s users are women. In a time when online side hustles and gigs are proliferating, her work helps us understand the forces that encourage skilled women to step off the sidelines and participate.\n\n\n\nA look inside Looped Yarn Works, a knitting store in Washington, D.C., on Nov. 13. (Lexey Swall/FTWP)\n\nMany entrepreneurs emerge from a pool of dedicated hobbyists, but it\u2019s hard to study that transition. You\u2019d have to meticulously track years of activities, interests and output of every person who participates in a hobby. Remarkably, Ravelry\u2019s design encourages their users to do almost exactly that.\n\nThe 8 million-plus people who have signed up for Ravelry since 2007 represent a diverse cross-section of the world\u2019s knitters. According to the site, Ravelry makes most of its money through \u201cyarn-related advertising.\u201d\n\nTogether those knitters have built the kind of detailed, long-running data set that prior generations of economists could only dream of. They post the projects they complete, the patterns and yarn they use, and the real-world groups they join. They even link their accounts to personal storefronts where they sell patterns to other users.\n\n\u201cFor knitters it is great to keep records,\u201d Kim said. \u201cFor researchers, it is great to observe every knitting activity of every knitter.\u201d\n\nTo better understand what transforms pattern users into pattern sellers, Kim reviewed 99 interviews with knitters on a niche newsletter and three blogs. The most common answer, by far, was that they\u2019d been encouraged by people they knew, such as husbands and friends. Many had already been modifying patterns and designing their own yarn gnomes and cat costumes, but until they heard from others, they lacked the confidence to step out on their own.\n\n\u201cFor many entrepreneurs, I think the biggest personal challenge is believing in yourself \u2014 that what you are creating is something that is desired and valued by others,\u201d designer Luise O\u2019Neill told the Patternfish newsletter in 2015.\n\nKim\u2019s analysis of data on 403,168 individual knitters from 2007 to 2014 backs this up. People who joined a so-called \u201cstitch n\u2019 bitch\u201d group to craft socially were 25 percent more likely than otherwise identical knitters to take the plunge into entrepreneurship. This is true even when correcting for geography, experience, skill level and productivity.\n\n\n\nOffline social networks create online entrepreneurs\n\nThe transformation begins immediately, implying that knitters realized their talent soon after meeting their peers, comparing their work and receiving feedback and encouragement.\n\nKim found the effect was strongest among those who were already the most skilled knitters. That suggests that in many cases social networks such as stitch n\u2019 bitch groups create entrepreneurs by encouraging those with the most talent, rather than educating those who lag behind.\n\nUniversity of Virginia economist Eric Chyn called Kim\u2019s approach creative and effective. \u201cIt\u2019s very compelling evidence using new data,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt tells us something about the way in which peers matter,\u201d said Chyn. He was not involved in Kim\u2019s research but has studied similar social effects in different contexts.\n\nChyn said Kim\u2019s analysis suggested your peers may influence you in ways academics may not typically consider. It\u2019s often believed your social connections can propel you into entrepreneurship by providing information and resources that enable you to start a new business.\n\nWomen tended to be skilled stitchers and pattern designers before they joined their stitch n' bitch groups.\n\nBut the offline social network of the gatherings gave the knitters something they didn\u2019t have before: confidence.", "This post has been updated.\n\nAs House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi works to shore up support for her speaker bid, it is unclear whether she has the votes to become speaker during a final floor vote in January, according to a Fix analysis.\n\nOf the 56 non-incumbent Democrats elected last week, nine have continued to say they will not vote for Pelosi and 38 have dodged questions (sometimes repeatedly) about her.

The International Energy Agency said Wednesday Nov. 14, 2018, that global oil supplies are growing rapidly as Saudi Arabia, the United States and Russia pump oil at a record rate in response to fears of higher prices as a result of renewed U.S. sanctions on Iran. (Eric Gay, File/Associated Press)\n\nFRANKFURT, Germany \u2014 The International Energy Agency said Wednesday that global oil supplies are growing rapidly as Saudi Arabia, the United States and Russia pump more oil in response to fears of higher prices as a result of renewed U.S. sanctions on Iran.\n\nThe IEA said in its monthly report that October output rose by 2.6 million barrels a day to 100.7 million barrels as producers heeded warnings that looming U.S. sanctions could mean a loss of Iranian oil to the market and thus lead to higher prices.\n\nBut when President Donald Trump imposed sanctions Nov. 5, he issued six-month waivers for some of Iran\u2019s biggest oil customers. That helped send prices lower. Brent crude is trading below $70 per barrel, down from a four-year high above $86 per barrel in early October.\n\nBrent prices rose 0.6 percent on Wednesday to $65.86 at 1115 GMT (6:13 a.m. EST).\n\nThe Paris-based agency welcomed the higher production and stockpiles, saying that the response to the call by the IEA and others to boost production \u201cis a reminder that the oil industry works best when it works together.\u201d\n\nThe agency said that lower prices \u201care clearly a benefit to consumers,\u201d especially those in developing countries who are seeing higher fuel prices due to weak national currencies. Oil is priced in dollars and the U.S. currency has been strong of late.\n\nThe report authors warned that although the market seems more relaxed than a few weeks ago, rising stocks should be \u201cwelcomed as a form of insurance\u201d against unpredictable market events. The report notes that \u201cthe United States remains committed to reducing Iranian oil exports to zero from the 1.8 million barrels per day seen today.\u201d\n\nThere were also concerns about the stability of production in Nigeria, Libya, and Venezuela, while a tanker collision in Norwegian waters, though modest in impact, \u201cis another reminder of the vulnerability of the system to accidents.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

China\u2019s premier sought Tuesday to reassure its neighbors that Beijing will push ahead with reforms needed to support growth across the region and also keep the peace in contested waters in the South China Sea. (Bullit Marquez/Associated Press)\n\nSINGAPORE \u2014 Leaders of Southeast Asian nations have pushed back yet again an agreement on a pan-Asian free trade deal amid a whirlwind of diplomacy Wednesday at their annual summit.\n\nIn convening talks among the leaders of countries participating in the plan, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said a final agreement on the deal, which is expected to encompass nearly half the world\u2019s population and 40 percent of world trade, will be pushed back until 2019.\n\nLee\u2019s comments confirmed earlier expectations that the 16 countries in the plan, called the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, or RCEP, would not meet their goal of finalizing the accord this year.\n\nThe trade talks followed scores of bilateral meetings among the leaders and talks on other issues such as regional security, how to keep peace in the South China Sea and the crisis over hundreds of thousands of ethnic Rohingya Muslims who have fled to Bangladesh from Myanmar to escape violence.\n\nDuring the meetings in Singapore, Lee has championed the region\u2019s commitment to free trade and a multilateral approach to sorting out the issue \u2014 in contrast with President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerican First\u201d preference for bilateral trade deals and distrust of international institutions.\n\n\u201cWe are meeting at a critical time. Protectionism and anti-globalization sentiments are on the rise. This can have a devastating impact on the regional as well as the global economy, and business confidence in Asia is already being affected,\u201d Lee said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important that we redouble our economic integration efforts and maintain a free, open and rules-based multilateral trading system which has underpinned our growth and prosperity,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump withdrew from a Pacific Rim trade initiative, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, just after taking office last year. That trade pact is due to take effect on Dec. 30. The U.S. is not part of the RCEP initiative, which includes China, India, Australia and most other Asian economies.\n\nLee said participating countries had finished five of seven chapters in their agreement and shown \u201cstrong political will\u201d in finishing it. He warned that further delays in reaching an agreement would damage the RCEP\u2019s credibility.\n\n\u201cWe are now at the final stage of negotiations. With a strong momentum generated this year, I am pleased to note that the RCEP negotiations are poised for conclusion in 2019,\u201d he said.\n\nThe 10 Association of Southeast Asian Nations members include Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. Earlier Wednesday, the ASEAN leaders met with their counterparts from Australia, China, South Korea, Russia and Japan.\n\nManaging conflict in the South China Sea is a perennial concern; China is pitted against its smaller neighbors in multiple disputes in the sea over coral reefs and lagoons in waters crucial for global commerce and rich in fish and potential oil and gas reserves.\n\nWhile in Singapore, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang has sought to reassure China\u2019s neighbors.\n\n\u201cWe have found the way to properly manage and defuse differences, for example, on the issue of the South China Sea in the past years,\u201d Li said, adding that the situation was moving toward \u201cgreater stability\u201d with progress toward a single draft text on a code of conduct in the sea. He reiterated Beijing\u2019s hope to have a final agreement within three years.\n\nPhilippine President Rodrigo Duterte said such a code was needed \u201cat all cost\u201d to prevent dangerous miscalculations.\n\nThe Philippines softened its earlier harsh criticism of China\u2019s assertive moves in the disputed waters after Duterte sought to repair relations with Beijing once he took office in 2016 and sought infrastructure funding, trade and investment from Beijing.\n\nThe region already has a nonbinding \u201cDeclaration of Conduct\u201d but is working toward a more robust agreement, with China appearing to win support for its calls to ban involvement by outside powers, such as the United States, in maritime disputes.\n\nDuterte cited a risk of \u201cserious miscalculation\u201d and potential clashes that could trigger military action based on mutual defense treaties.\n\n\u201cSo you are there, so you are in possession, you have occupied it, but tell us what route we should take, what kind of behavior ...\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cEverything\u2019s been excellent between China and the rest of ASEAN except for the fact that there\u2019s friction between the Western nations and China,\u201d Duterte told reporters as he headed into meetings.\n\nWhile the Singapore meetings were typically focused on cooperation and goodwill, concerns over Myanmar\u2019s treatment of its ethnic Rohingya Muslims flared with unusually sharp comments to the country\u2019s leader, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.\n\nU.S. Vice President Mike Pence told Suu Kyi on Wednesday that the situation was inexcusable. He also took aim at Myanmar\u2019s arrest and imprisonment of two Reuters journalists.\n\nOn Tuesday, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed lambasted Suu Kyi for her handling of the crisis that led to mass killings and the exodus of more than 700,000 Rohingya from Buddhist-majority Myanmar since August 2017.\n\nMahathir, whose own country has a Muslim majority, said he told Suu Kyi that as a former political detainee, she should show more compassion.\n\n\u201cThey are actually oppressing these people to the point of, well, killing them, mass killing, and burial in graves dug by the victims and that kind of thing,\u201d said Mahathir, a 93-year-old political veteran whose own past treatment of dissidents at times drew opprobrium. \u201cThat may be relevant in ancient times, but in modern days, we don\u2019t do that kind of thing.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP)\n\nThe date was Oct. 23, 2010 \u2014 nearly two years into President Barack Obama\u2019s first term and two weeks before the first midterm elections of his presidency. Speaking to the National Journal, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) made a now-infamous statement: \u201cThe single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president.\u201d\n\nAs The Washington Post\u2019s Glenn Kessler has pointed out, reading the quote in its full context makes it clear that McConnell was saying that it would be impossible for Republicans to achieve their policy goals with Obama in office. But Democrats immediately seized on the remark as proof that Republicans had single-mindedly set out to obstruct Obama\u2019s agenda, putting partisanship ahead of the country\u2019s best interest.\n\nOn Tuesday, a week after Democrats won control of the House of Representatives, McConnell, now the majority leader, published a FoxNews.com op-ed that struck a very different note. \u201cWill Dems work with us, or simply put partisan politics ahead of the country?\u201d the headline asked. Needless to say, it didn\u2019t go over well with liberals, who rushed to point out McConnell\u2019s unparalleled chutzpah and accuse him of blatant hypocrisy.\n\nSuch an ironic Op-Ed title coming from you @senatemajldr - don\u2019t you think? https://t.co/RFJVeRp6z4 \u2014 Amy McGrath (@AmyMcGrathKY) November 14, 2018\n\nMy latest Op-Ed: \u201cOur number one priority should be ensuring that Mitch McConnell is an only-one-more-term Majority Leader.\u201d https://t.co/yiASk0S4ud \u2014 Pat Cunnane (@PatCunnane) November 14, 2018\n\nThe op-ed began with McConnell recounting what Republicans have accomplished over the past two years: passing tax cuts, confirming two Supreme Court nominees and rolling back federal regulations. \u201cAfter this prolific run, I was not surprised to be asked over the past week about just how much the American people can expect from the next Congress under divided leadership,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWhat can we realistically accomplish?\u201d\n\nThe good news, McConnell answered, is that \u201creports of the death of bipartisanship in Washington have been wildly exaggerated.\u201d Legislation targeting the opioid epidemic, increasing defense funding, reforming the Department of Veterans Affairs and funding infrastructure improvements passed with support from both parties, he noted. Then, in an abrupt tack, he argued that Democrats, having regained control of the House, should refrain from investigating President Trump:\n\nThe Senate has proven its ability to reach bipartisan solutions to some of the most pressing challenges facing our nation. And looking ahead to the coming year, there will be no shortage of opportunities to continue this impressive record of cooperation across the aisle and across the Capitol. What we can make of those opportunities will depend on our Democratic colleagues. Will they choose to go it alone and simply make political points? Or will they choose to work together and actually make a difference? Last week, the American people made it abundantly clear that they prefer that Congress focus on making a difference. That message may have been lost on a few House Democrats, who have made clear their preference for investigations over policy results. After years of rhetoric, it\u2019s hardly news that some are more interested in fanning the flames of division than reaching across the aisle.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, McConnell (or, more likely, a member of his staff) posted a link to the op-ed on Twitter. By midnight, he had received over 29,000 replies. Virtually all of them were from aggrieved liberals, many of whom responded with just one name: Merrick Garland, Obama\u2019s Supreme Court nominee, whose appointment was blocked by McConnell.\n\nAmong the other responses:\n\n\u201cI hope we work with you the same way you worked with President Obama.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that every time Mitch McConnell tries to use the word \u2018partisan\u2019 a pie should hit him in the face.\u201d\n\n\u201cDude, you are in my lifetime one of the most zero-sum partisans I\u2019ve ever witnessed in politics. That\u2019s not something to be proud of. It\u2019s the reason why Congress is so dysfunctional.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou kept Democrats off all committees and withheld all information, so no. Go eat worms.\u201d\n\n\u201cLol seriously?! How often did you work with Dems? How many times did you shut them out of major decisions when you had the majority or rammed things down our throats? Maybe you should have had this epiphany before now.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr McConnell, yes, you\u2019re the world\u2019s top expert on putting party above country. No one has ever done so more blatantly than you. But now YOU are calling for bipartisanship? Your hypocrisy is astounding. Obviously, no decent American is going to take you seriously.\u201d\n\nMcConnell\u2019s office couldn\u2019t be reached for comment on the Twitter reaction late Tuesday night. It\u2019s worth noting that his sentiments, however unpopular online, are not entirely out of sync with top Democratic Party leaders. Last week, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) pledged that Democrats would \u201cstrive for bipartisanship\u201d and seek common ground with Republicans \u2014 a conciliatory stance that incurred the wrath of some of her constituents.\n\nPelosi, who is vying to become the next House speaker, also avoided making any definitive statements about potential investigations into the Trump administration at a news conference immediately after the midterms. Telling reporters that the House of Representatives has \u201ca constitutional responsibility to have oversight,\u201d she added that she didn\u2019t anticipate \u201cany scattershot freelancing\u201d on that front. Democrats, she said, are \u201ctrying to unify our country.\u201d\n\nMore from Morning Mix:\n\nShot in the neck at 17, this is the trauma surgeon now leading doctors against gun violence and the NRA\n\n\u2018Bill Clinton should want to apologize\u2019: Monica Lewinsky opens up about scandal in new documentary\n\nCan CNN beat the White House in court?

Liberman called for elections to be held as soon as possible.\n\nAll eyes are now on Education Minister Naftali Bennett, leader of another right-wing party, who has also called for a stronger military response to the Gaza unrest. Bennett, who has a fractious relationship with Netanyahu, is demanding to take Liberman\u2019s place as defense minister or his party will also leave the coalition, according to senior officials in his party. Analysts say Netanyahu is more likely to call elections than bend to Bennett\u2019s demand.\n\nPalestinian armed factions in Gaza announced the cease-fire on Tuesday night after a bout of fighting triggered by a botched Israeli operation into the Hamas-controlled strip.

Demonstrators burned tires on the main road into the city of Sderot and blocked the main commercial crossing into Gaza.\n\nBut in Gaza, Palestinians celebrated the cease-fire as a victory. And following Liberman\u2019s announcement that he was stepping down, Hamas crowed over the move as another win, handing out sweets on the streets. \u201cThe resignation of Liberman is a political victory for Gaza,\u201d said Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri.

Liberman\u2019s departure makes it more likely that Netanyahu will call new elections, they said.\n\nPolitical analysts and media commentators have long suspected that Netanyahu wanted to hold a vote before his full term in office ends in another year. An election victory could help distract public attention from the ongoing corruption investigation he faces and from a possible indictment and trial.\n\nNetanyahu is unlikely to give in to Bennett\u2019s demand to become defense minister, said Abraham Diskin, a professor of political science at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and that also means early elections are likely.\n\nIn a meeting Wednesday, Bennett\u2019s Knesset faction voted unanimously to demand the defense portfolio to enhance Israel\u2019s deterrence capacity, officials in the party said.

More than 200 Palestinians have been killed in the weekly protests, which Israel calls riots and a cover for terrorist attacks.\n\nOn Wednesday, Netanyahu took part in a ceremony for Israel\u2019s first prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, at his grave in southern Israel, which faced the brunt of the barrage of rockets Monday and Tuesday.\n\n\u201cA leader must be attentive to the hearts of the people, and our people are wise, but in times of emergency and when making crucial decisions in the field of security, the public cannot always be a partner to the crucial considerations,\u201d he said. \u201cAt these moments, leadership is not about doing the easy thing.

Liberman\u2019s departure makes it more likely that Netanyahu will call new elections, they said.\n\nPolitical analysts and media commentators have long suspected that Netanyahu wanted to hold a vote before his full term in office ends in another year. An election victory could help distract public attention from the ongoing corruption investigation he faces and from a possible indictment and trial.\n\nNetanyahu is unlikely to give in to Bennett\u2019s demand to become defense minister, said Abraham Diskin, a professor of political science at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and that also means early elections are likely.\n\nIn a meeting Wednesday, Bennett\u2019s Knesset faction voted unanimously to demand the defense portfolio to enhance Israel\u2019s deterrence capacity, officials in the party said. If there wasn\u2019t such improvement, it would be pointless to remain in the government, they said.\n\nNetanyahu has said he does not believe there is a long-term diplomatic solution to the threat posed by militants in Gaza, but at the same time, he has resisted military action.\n\nWhile he talks tough on security, Netanyahu has proven cautious when it comes to military action, said Yoaz Hendel, chairman of the Institute for Zionist Strategies, who was previously Netanyahu\u2019s communications director. \u201cThere is a huge gap between a politician\u2019s declarations and the actions they take after elections.\u201d\n\nNetanyahu held a marathon meeting with his security cabinet, including Liberman, through much of the day Tuesday.\n\nA statement following the meeting said only that the Israeli military had been \u201cinstructed to continue its operations as necessary.\u201d Israeli news outlets later reported that a cease-fire had been agreed to.\n\nIsrael and Hamas have fought three deadly wars in 10 years, and flare-ups have become increasingly frequent in recent months as Hamas has urged residents to protest at the fence along the border with Israel. More than 200 Palestinians have been killed in the weekly protests, which Israel calls riots and a cover for terrorist attacks.\n\nOn Wednesday, Netanyahu took part in a ceremony for Israel\u2019s first prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, at his grave in southern Israel, which faced the brunt of the barrage of rockets Monday and Tuesday.\n\n\u201cA leader must be attentive to the hearts of the people, and our people are wise, but in times of emergency and when making crucial decisions in the field of security, the public cannot always be a partner to the crucial considerations,\u201d he said. \u201cAt these moments, leadership is not about doing the easy thing. Leadership is about doing the right thing, even if it is difficult.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nIsraelis kill more than 50 Palestinians in Gaza fence protests\n\nTensions rise as Gaza militants fire more than 70 mortars, rockets into Israel\n\nTensions escalate as Israeli jets pound targets in Gaza in response to rocket fire\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "This post has been updated.\n\nIt may wind up being the most consequential legal question in Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s entire Russia investigation, and it has nothing to do with Mueller.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s acting attorney general, Matthew G. Whitaker, is facing a legal fight to keep his job. After several legal experts raised constitutional objections to it, the state of Maryland has sought an injunction to declare Whitaker\u2019s appointment illegal and to recognize Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein as the rightful acting attorney general. The Justice Department has now responded.\n\nWhitaker\u2019s commentary on the Mueller probe is clearly sympathetic to Trump \u2014 to the extent of musing about defunding Mueller and even suggesting the Trump Tower meeting was business-as-usual. If he continues as acting attorney general, he could rule on consequential issues including potential indictments of Trump allies, up to and including the president\u2019s son. He could reject an attempt to subpoena the president.\n\nHis fate now appears to rest, in part, on an obscure century-old Supreme Court case that isn\u2019t exactly analogous to Whitaker\u2019s situation. But it may not need to be, and the ultimate arbiter of this could be the Supreme Court.\n\nThe basic issue at hand is whether Whitaker, who did not need to be confirmed by the Senate for his previous job as then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019s chief of staff, can replace Sessions in an acting capacity. The Constitution\u2019s \u201cAdvice and Consent\u201d clause holds that principal officers \u2014 that is, those who have no superior but the president, of which the attorney general is one \u2014 must have Senate approval. Since Whitaker would be serving in place of a principal officer, George Conway and former solicitor general Neal Katyal wrote in the New York Times, his appointment is \u201cillegal.\u201d\n\nUnless, that is, he wouldn\u2019t actually be considered a principal officer. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) has said in recent days that Whitaker has defended himself by citing a 2003 opinion from the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel. That 2003 opinion (which was incidentally written by Ed Whelan, most recently of Brett M. Kavanaugh-related infamy) in turn relies upon an 1898 Supreme Court case called United States v. Eaton.\n\nEaton seemed to lower the bar for acting officials serving in place of principals. It addressed the case of an unconfirmed \u201cvice consul\u201d serving in Siam \u2014 what is now Thailand. That vice consul was appointed to serve as a temporary replacement for the Senate-confirmed consul when the consul fell ill, but then a compensation dispute arose, with the ill consul and the vice consul both claiming the consul\u2019s salary.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled that the vice consul could act for the consul, even though he hadn\u2019t been confirmed by the Senate, because he wasn\u2019t technically becoming the consul:\n\nBecause the subordinate officer is charged with the performance of the duty of the superior for a limited time, and under special and temporary conditions, he is not thereby transformed into the superior and permanent official. To so hold would render void any and every delegation of power to an inferior to perform under any circumstances or exigency the duties of a superior officer, and the discharge of administrative duties would be seriously hindered.\n\nThe parallel to Whitaker\u2019s case is apparent. Just as the vice consul didn\u2019t need to be confirmed because he was only serving on an acting basis, Whitaker seems likely to argue that he, too, can serve without confirmation on a temporary basis. He\u2019ll essentially argue that the acting job isn\u2019t a principal job, because it\u2019s temporary. And he\u2019ll have some backup, given that acting officials don\u2019t assume the salary of the principals they are filling in for.\n\nBut the parallels only go so for. In Eaton, the vice consul was the highest-ranking official available in Siam; the next person in line had not yet been confirmed by the Senate and hadn\u2019t made his way overseas. In the case of Whitaker, there are Senate-confirmed officials in place, including most notably Rosenstein but also Solicitor General Noel Francisco. There is even a law on the books that determines the line of succession.\n\nThe language above from Eaton also cites \u201cspecial and temporary conditions.\u201d Trump effectively forced Sessions out, and even though Sessions technically resigned, he took care to note it was at Trump\u2019s urging. \u201cAs you requested,\u201d Sessions wrote, \u201cI am submitting my resignation.\u201d So is it an emergency if it\u2019s a situation of Trump\u2019s own making? If he can do this, couldn\u2019t he just force out people he doesn\u2019t like in the name of creating supposed emergencies and appointing unconfirmed acting replacements?\n\nAnne Joseph O\u2019Connell, an expert on presidential appointments at Stanford University, said she believes Whitaker\u2019s appointment is constitutional \u2014 even if it\u2019s \u201cterrible as a matter of policy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Whitaker situation is hard as it doesn\u2019t appear to be an emergency. But such facts can make bad law,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat if Sessions were pushed out for true wrongdoing? Would that have counted? I don\u2019t think courts want to get in the business of figuring out reasons for departures.\u201d\n\nThe situation might not even need to be an emergency, though. At the time of Eaton in 1898, there was no such thing as the Federal Vacancies Reform Act. That act, which came exactly 100 years later, in 1998, created three means by which a Senate-confirmed vacancy could be filled on a temporary basis. The third method is by someone with at least 90 days' service in the last year at the agency at issue, provided they have served above a certain pay grade, known as \u201cGS-15\u2033 \u2014 qualifications that Whitaker meets.\n\nThe FVRA makes no mention of an \u201cemergency\u201d being required, though. Instead, it says one of the three options can be triggered as long as the principal \u201cdies, resigns, or is otherwise unable to perform the functions and duties of the office.\u201d Sessions technically resigned, so as long as the FVRA is considered constitutional, Whitaker would seem to be in the clear.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s true that the Whitaker situation is different from that of our 1890s man in Siam,\u201d said Andrew Rudalevige of Bowdoin College, \u201cbut so is the law.\u201d\n\nThe counterargument to all of that comes from John Yoo, a Bush administration aide who served in the DOJ\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel around the same time as the 2003 opinion and previously served as general counsel for the Senate Judiciary Committee. He writes in the Atlantic that Whitaker satisfies the requirements of the FVRA, but that the appointment might still be deemed unconstitutional:\n\nDefenders might rely on an 1898 Supreme Court decision, United States v. Eaton, which allowed for the temporary appointment of a vice-consul in Thailand \u201cfor a limited time, and under special and temporary conditions,\u201d namely, the illness of the consul and the vast distance between the U.S. and Thailand. This is basically the approach of a 2003 Justice Department opinion approving the elevation of an assistant Office of Management and Budget director to acting director, and the likely reasoning of the White House in appointing Whitaker. ... Elevating practical needs over constitutional meaning, however, is not an attitude usually adopted by conservatives. ... It is difficult to see [Chief Justice] John Roberts\u2019s Court finding that the acting attorney general, responsible for all federal law enforcement in the nation, amounts to the same sort of officer as a vice-consul struggling in the hinterlands of Thailand before the days of air flight and instantaneous communications.\n\nBut David Lewis of Vanderbilt University said the court was unlikely to make such an exception.\n\n\u201cIn cases where the Constitution is silent like this, Congress and the president enact laws to regularize practice,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cThe 1998 Vacancies Reform Act attempted to regularize the presidential practice of filling Senate confirmed positions on a temporary basis and did so with an eye toward curbing the president\u2019s ability to use acting officials as replacements for actual nominees.\u201d\n\nThe arguments against Whitaker\u2019s appointment seem more aspirational and idealistic -- as if that\u2019s what the proponents think the courts should decide and not necessarily what they will. That\u2019s not necessarily from a partisan perspective (Conway and Yoo are both Republicans) but from a Constitutional one. But on the other side, experts on appointments seem to see Whitaker as likely to prevail. We shall see. The implications are massive.", "A disputatious reporter seeks access to the White House but is blocked by Secret Service. Debate ensues over the journalist\u2019s tactics and whether he presents a physical threat more menacing than the pummeling that issues from his pen, or his microphone. The government doesn\u2019t offer a clear account and is sued on First Amendment grounds.\n\nCNN\u2019s Jim Acosta isn\u2019t the original protagonist in this drama, which is roiling Washington and drawing stern warnings from the likes of Bob Woodward. While the controversy, like so many others with President Trump at their center, appears to occupy uncharted territory, it actually doesn\u2019t.\n\nA case cited in the network\u2019s complaint against Trump, as well as members of his administration and the Secret Service, points to an important precursor, which holds clues about the viability of CNN\u2019s suit, filed Tuesday.\n\nThe case is Sherrill v. Knight, decided in 1977 by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. It\u2019s still good law in the district where CNN filed its suit, to which the White House is supposed to respond by 11 a.m. Wednesday, according to an order from Timothy Kelly, a former attorney for the Senate Judiciary Committee who was named by Trump to the federal bench last year.\n\nIn the 1977 case, the court found that denial of White House credentials was a sufficiently grave infringement on the freedom of the press that it couldn\u2019t just be done by fiat. It required, at the very least, \u201cnotice of the factual bases for denial, an opportunity for the applicant to respond\u201d and \u201ca final written statement of the reasons for denial.\u201d Notably, the court prohibited \u201ccontent-based criteria for press pass issuance.\u201d\n\nThe critical finding, according to Mark H. Lynch of Covington & Burling, who argued the case before the D.C. Circuit, was this: Given the \u201cimportant First Amendment rights implicated by refusal to grant White House press passes to bona fide Washington journalists,\u201d as the court held, \u201csuch refusal must be based on a compelling governmental interest.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnder the circumstances of the Acosta denial, the government is not going to be able to meet that standard,\u201d Lynch predicted in an email exchange with The Washington Post.\n\nLynch, then an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union, represented the late Robert Sherrill, an ink-stained contrarian who bore little resemblance to the CNN White House correspondent \u2014 except on the important point that he was an irritant to the White House.\n\nAcosta has worn that identity proudly. \u201cIf I may ask one other question,\u201d he said at Trump\u2019s post-midterms news conference last week, as the president sought to move on, telling him, \u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d\n\nThe exchange prompted the administration to yank the reporter\u2019s credentials, falsely accusing him of \u201cplacing his hands\u201d on a White House intern who had tried to seize his microphone.\n\nAcosta, who has been accused of showboating, didn\u2019t yield. On-screen and on social media, his tactics are tailor-made for the modern media environment.\n\nAnd his employer has his back. \u201cPlaintiffs bring this action to enforce this constitutional commitment, restore Acosta\u2019s well-deserved press credentials, and ensure that the press remains free to question the government and to report the business of the nation to the American people,\u201d the network explained in its complaint.\n\nDon\u2019t believe the lies coming from the WH. Believe in our freedoms. Thank you all for your support. We won\u2019t back down. \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 #1A \u2014 Jim Acosta (@Acosta) November 8, 2018\n\nSherrill\u2019s persona was different, yet there are parallels. Once called an \u201cinexhaustible loner of Washington journalism,\u201d he cut the capital\u2019s larger-than-life figures down to size in books that earned him the ire of his subjects, including Lyndon B. Johnson and Hubert H. Humphrey. A muckraker, he exposed American greed and folly in investigations into military judicial abuses and the oil and gun industries.\n\nA self-described \u201cindependent radical journalist,\u201d he used caustic wit to document unseen suffering. \u201cSince the Depression,\u201d he wrote in the New York Times in 1967, \u201cpoor people have been much more discreet about their starving.\u201d But his work also met criticism. One review called his account of the late Democrat senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts and the 1969 Chappaquiddick incident a \u201cslander book.\u201d\n\nSherrill had little patience for the decorum of the political press corps. As a reporter for the Miami Herald in 1964, he punched a press aide to C. Farris Bryant, the Democratic governor of Florida, while aboard a campaign train for Johnson, the Democratic presidential incumbent. \u201cI may have messed up a guy\u2019s jaw, but it wasn\u2019t a big deal,\u201d Sherrill would later tell the Atlantic Weekly.\n\nThe truculent journalist moved to the nation\u2019s capital in 1965 and soon became White House correspondent for the Nation, his tenure distinguished by the fact that he lacked access to the White House. His application for a press pass was denied in 1966.\n\nThe Secret Service, after an investigation, determined that he was not eligible, and addressed a memorandum to Bill Moyers, Johnson\u2019s press secretary at the time, asking that the information on which the agency\u2019s conclusion was based \u201cnot be disclosed to Mr. Sherrill or his employer,\u201d as later recounted in the D.C. Circuit opinion.\n\nAs the ACLU took up his case, the White House confirmed that the reporter had been denied accreditation \u201cfor reasons of security.\u201d A Treasury official informed the reporter that his arrest for physical assault in Florida was at issue.\n\nThe ACLU filed a complaint on the reporter\u2019s behalf in district court, alleging breach of the First and Fifth amendments, which guarantee freedom of the press and due process of law. Rather than deciding on the legality of the denial itself, the court instructed the Secret Service to \u201cdevise and publicize narrow and specific standards\u201d for refusing access.\n\nA three-judge panel of the appeals court \u2014 Carl E. McGowan, Harold Leventhal and Roger Robb \u2014 affirmed that judgment, with McGowan writing for the panel. While acknowledging that \u201ca citizen\u2019s right to obtain information\u201d is limited, the appeals court reasoned that the \u201cFirst Amendment interest\u201d was significant enough to set clear \u201crequirements of notice\u201d when shutting out a journalist.\n\nFundamentally, the court found that the First Amendment protected press access to the White House.\n\n\u201cWhite House press facilities having been made publicly available as a source of information for newsmen, the protection afforded newsgathering under the First Amendment guarantee of freedom of the press requires that this access not be denied arbitrarily or for less than compelling reasons,\u201d the appeals court reasoned.\n\nThe physical safety of the president might very well be a legitimate reason, the court argued, but it had to be made publicly known and subject to rebuttal. The court further judged that \u201carbitrary or content-based criteria for press pass issuance are prohibited under the First Amendment.\u201d\n\nLuke M. Milligan, a professor at the University of Louisville School of Law and author of a law review article on press rights, told The Post in an email that it will be difficult for CNN to prove that the content of Acosta\u2019s reporting was cause for the denial, while the White House \u201cwill point to the journalist\u2019s disruptive conduct \u2014 not yielding to other reporters, refusing to hand over the microphone and lecturing the president rather than asking a question.\u201d\n\nBut Josh Blackman of the South Texas College of Law in Houston said a court doesn\u2019t need to decide that \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s hatred of CNN renders the denial unconstitutional.\u201d The network gave a court the opportunity to avoid ruling on a thorny constitutional question by pairing its First Amendment argument with a claim that the denial was \u201carbitrary and capricious,\u201d in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\n\u201cIf a court is inclined to think the administration violated the First Amendment, the judge is also likely to think the denial is \u2018arbitrary and capricious,\u2019 \u201d Blackman said. \u201cTherefore, the remedy would be to restore the press pass.\u201d\n\nAcosta\u2019s case has implications beyond his high-profile feud with the president. As the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press observed in a brief, \u201cAll members of the news media feel the threat to First Amendment freedoms posed by the government\u2019s retaliatory revocation of Acosta\u2019s security credentials \u2014 a threat made all the more real by President Trump\u2019s promise that there \u2018could be others\u2019 who also lose their White House security credentials.\u201d\n\nBut if Sherrill\u2019s case suggests that the government\u2019s approach is on infirm footing, the reporter\u2019s approach offers lessons, too.\n\nThough he won his case against the Secret Service, he didn\u2019t go running for credentials.\n\n\u201cThe fun thing about this was that when I was finally going to get a press pass, I never applied,\u201d Sherrill told the Los Angeles Times in 1990. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be in the White House. I had been in Washington long enough to realize that was the last place to waste your time sitting around for some dumb . . . to give a press conference.\"\n\nSherrill died in 2014 at the age of 89.", "Good morning & welcome back!

(Win McNamee/Getty Images)\n\nOn The Hill\n\nTRUMP'S MVP: House Republicans are expected to pick Kevin McCarthy as their minority leader when the party meets today for leadership elections. House Freedom Caucus co-founder Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) is challenging McCarthy, but isn't expected to best the California lawmaker despite GOP grousing about losing the House majority in the midterms.\n\nWill McCarthy's close bond with Trump and his fluency in #MAGA-speak be his greatest asset or at odds with his new responsibilities to lead Republicans back from the wilderness in 2020 alongside a president whose divisive status, some say, is partly to blame for last week's bruising defeat? We talked to some people about it:\n\nUnderstanding Trump and McCarthy's affinity for one another: It's no surprise to those who know the two men that Trump and \u201cmy Kevin,\u201d as the president calls him \u2014 both described as \u201cbackslapping\u201d and \u201caffable\u201d by allies \u2014 get along. But their relationship dates back to the infamous \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d episode in 2016.\n\nPer a source close to the White House: \u201cOn a weekend when almost every member of the GOP establishment and every member of Republican leadership chastised and attacked Trump \u2014 McCarthy was the lone member of leadership publicly defending Trump . . . and that\u2019s something that stuck with both the president and the people around him. When he was in his darkest hour, McCarthy didn't tuck tail and run away from him \u2014 he stood up and fought with him. He took the exact opposite approach that Paul Ryan and the rest of the establishment took and that cemented their relationship.\u201d\n\nHow McCarthy has shaped the House in Trump's GOP: Hill GOP sources and those close to the White House point to McCarthy's success in unifying the House GOP's ideological factions as majority leader. But some also contend, correctly, that as majority leader, McCarthy helped lead the GOP into defeat along with outgoing House Speaker Ryan (R-Wis.).\n\nSources point to McCarthy's support for an ideologically diverse leadership slate as a strength. For example, the two Republicans running for the no. 5 leadership spot \u2014 chair of the GOP policy committee \u2014 are from the Freedom Caucus. McCarthy's \u201csupported leadership that is more ideologically in line with GOP voters than probably at any time in the last decade,\u201d a source close to the White House said.\n\nFor example, the two Republicans running for the no. 5 leadership spot \u2014 chair of the GOP policy committee \u2014 are from the Freedom Caucus. McCarthy has also mirrored Trump on immigration: He introduced right before the elections the \u201cBuild the Wall, Enforce the Law Act,\u201d which full funds Trump's $23.4 billion dollar wall along the Southern border. The bill also cuts off funds for sanctuary cities.\n\nHe introduced right before the elections the \u201cBuild the Wall, Enforce the Law Act,\u201d which full funds Trump's $23.4 billion dollar wall along the Southern border.

Republicans stand to lose several Republican incumbents in the Golden State with the Associated Press calling the race against Rep. Jeff Denham (R-Calif.) last night, and Rep. Mimi Walters (R) and GOP candidate Young Kim in trouble there too.\n\nHow McCarthy can be most effective: Marc Short, Trump's former director of legislative affairs, said that McCarthy's greatest asset will be providing Trump advice on how policy positions will play out politically and how the president's rhetoric or actions will impact individual House members.\n\nPolitics: \u201cI recall when we had our retreat back in January . . . Kevin laid out the political map and the way he saw things going \u2014 he has the uncanny ability to retain information on almost every House district that Republicans occupy or that are swing districts,\u201d Short added.\n\n\u201cI recall when we had our retreat back in January . . .

Francis Rooney (R-Fla.) sang McCarthy's praises yesterday. \u201cI feel [McCarthy] invested a lot of time and interest in our area. He personally flew down to the Everglades with me, and looked at all the Okeechobee watershed restoration projects, stayed at our house.

(Jasic Workers Support Group via AP) (Associated Press)\n\nBEIJING \u2014 Students and alumni of several Chinese universities are sounding the alarm over the apparent detention of more than a dozen young labor activists who have been missing since the weekend.\n\nThree recent graduates of the elite Peking University have been taken away by authorities, the Jasic Workers Support Group said in a statement late Tuesday. According to the group, witnesses saw one person being \u201ckidnapped\u201d from the Beijing campus, while others in Shenzhen, Guangzhou and Shanghai also disappeared.\n\nThey were involved in a coalition, led by young Marxist activists, that was founded this summer to show solidarity with factory workers at Jasic Technology, a welding equipment manufacturer in southern China.\n\nActivists in China are routinely \u201cdisappeared\u201d by authorities working for the ruling Communist Party, which is wary of any collective action and potential threats to its authority. The government is particularly guarded about campus movements after the 1989 student-led pro-democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square which were ultimately crushed by the military.\n\nThe young Marxists, however, are an unusual target because they espouse the same values \u2014 socialism, workers\u2019 rights and Marxist ideology \u2014 which the party has advocated.\n\nThe sudden disappearances all occurred at around 9 p.m. on Friday, the Jasic Workers Support Group said. Three others in Wuhan, including one factory worker, were taken away by police on Sunday, though one was released early the next day.\n\nPeking University students and alumni expressed alarm after students published accounts online saying that they were beaten on campus by unidentified men who forced a recent graduate named Zhang Shengye into a car on Friday evening.\n\nIn a statement posted on an internal Peking University forum, the school\u2019s security department said the \u201csituation\u201d on Friday was that of a \u201cpolice department lawfully taking into custody a criminal suspect ... who is not a current student, teacher or employee of the school.\u201d\n\nA member of the security department confirmed over the phone Wednesday that the statement came from the university.\n\nOne fourth-year history student, writing on the Jasic Workers Support Group\u2019s website, said he was thrown to the ground outside of a lecture hall by five people dressed in black.\n\nWhen he asked them who they were, he recalled, one swore at him and yelled, \u201cIf you keep yelling, we\u2019ll keep hitting you!\u201d Shortly afterward, a tall, burly man started kicking his head.\n\nThe student said he then saw that someone was being dragged into a car that swiftly drove away.\n\nThe student who wrote this account could not be reached on Wednesday. Members of the Jasic Workers Support Group, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they believe he has been forced to leave campus for the time being.\n\nSomeone who identified himself as a third-year Peking University medical student said in an online post Wednesday that he had a similar encounter on that same night, when people in dark clothing rushed at him and held him to the ground until he bled.\n\nThirteen Peking University alumni attached their names to a public letter Wednesday evening protesting the treatment of the students, who said they were beaten.\n\nDecrying the \u201cillegal, gang-like violence,\u201d they wrote, \u201cPeking University should be a place where rule of law thrives!\u201d\n\nZhang, who graduated from Peking University\u2019s pharmaceutical school this year, was a vocal member of the Jasic Workers Support Group. He was among about 50 young people from across the country who convened in an apartment near Shenzhen in August to rally behind Jasic factory workers who were fired for trying to form a union.\n\nThe apartment was stormed by police in riot gear and the group members were detained for a few days before authorities escorted them back to their hometowns.

The high school senior had started the night at a school football game and ended it nearly bleeding to death in the emergency room. The errant gunshot, fired into the crowd amid a fight between other teenagers, ruptured Sakran\u2019s trachea, severed his carotid artery and paralyzed his vocal chord.\n\nBut Sakran was one of the lucky ones. The trauma surgeons at Inova Fairfax Hospital saved his life \u2014 and his voice.\n\nAnd now it\u2019s louder than ever.\n\nTwo decades later, Sakran is now a trauma surgeon himself at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore and an unofficial leader within the medical community\u2019s fight against gun violence, a movement that accelerated last week after the National Rifle Association told doctors to \u201cstay in their lane\u201d rather than \u201copine on firearm policy.\u201d\n\nDozens of doctors responded with both graphic and intimate stories of gun violence in their operating rooms, each with the Twitter hashtag #ThisIsOurLane, as The Washington Post\u2019s Frances Stead Sellers previously reported. For Sakran it couldn\u2019t ring truer. He launched the page ThisIsOurLane on Twitter Saturday, turning it into a window into doctors' everyday experiences extracting bullets from bodies. In just a few days it racked up more than 10,000 followers.\n\n\u201cHaving been shot in the throat, this has been an issue that has been near and dear to my heart for so many years,\u201d Sakran told The Post. \u201cBut once the NRA came out with that statement and really tried to undermine us and our role in gun violence and ending this public health crisis, that elevated the conversation to a different level. Thanks to the NRA, they actually united the medical community.\u201d\n\nAs a Trauma Surgeon and survivor of #GunViolence I cannot believe the audacity of the @NRA to make such a divisive statement.\n\n\n\nWe take care of these patients everyday. Where are you when I\u2019m having to tell all those families their loved one has died. @DocsDemand #Docs4GunSense https://t.co/XrY1G3hIi2 \u2014 Joseph Sakran (@JosephSakran) November 7, 2018\n\nSakran knew he wanted to become a trauma surgeon almost as soon as he recovered from his own surgery. While doctors were still tearing scar tissue out of his windpipe, he successfully applied for college at George Mason University. He got his start in the business of saving lives while training as a medic and firefighter in Fairfax before he went on to graduate from Ben-Gurion University Medical School for International Health. As it happens, he completed his surgery residency at Inova Fairfax Hospital, where he had been treated.\n\nHe trained alongside the same surgeons who saved his life as a teenager.\n\n\u201cIt was awe-inspiring to say the least,\u201d Sakran said. \u201cFor me the most gratifying opportunity was to give someone else the same second chance that those surgeons gave me.\u201d\n\nSakran\u2019s activism in gun violence prevention began early in his career, when he started giving talks to students in underserved communities about his own brush with gun violence. It became particularly visible this year, however, in wake of the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., when Sakran founded \u201cDocs Demand Action.\u201d\n\nThe network of doctors has mobilized around urging lawmakers to more robustly fund gun violence research in the same way Congress has funded research into other public health crises, such as motor vehicle fatalities or deadly diseases. Congress has not substantially funded gun violence research since 1996, when it passed the Dickey Amendment. The measure didn\u2019t necessarily ban gun violence research, but restricted research supporting \u201cgun control,\u201d resulting in a chilling effect on funds for gun violence research more broadly.\n\nThe amendment, backed by the NRA, came in response to concerns from gun rights groups that doctors would try to push anti-gun agendas \u2014 just as the NRA accused doctors of doing last week.\n\n\u201cPeople want to polarize this debate. But no one wants to take away the guns. That\u2019s not what we\u2019re saying,\u201d Sakran said. \"There\u2019s not one solution to this. Part of it is developing the right data and the right research in order to understand what solutions we need to implement. We just don\u2019t want to continue seeing these senseless tragedies come into our trauma centers day in and day out.\u201d\n\nThe NRA lashed out at doctors last week after the American College of Physicians published a position paper that also called for greater research into the effectiveness of various gun restrictions and other risk factors for gun violence. It included support for universal background checks; counseling patients about safe, childproof storage of guns in the home; consideration of waiting periods before purchasing guns, to possibly reduce suicides; and, perhaps incensing the NRA the most, a ban on ownership of semiautomatic weapons.\n\n\u201cSomeone should tell self-important anti-gun doctors to stay in their lane,\u201d the NRA wrote in a tweet linking to commentary shredding the ACP\u2019s paper. \u201cHalf of the articles in Annals of Internal Medicine are pushing for gun control.\u201d\n\nSomeone should tell self-important anti-gun doctors to stay in their lane.

The movement erupted the same night of the mass shooting in Thousand Oaks, Calif., and in the days that followed.\n\nBut Sakran said part of the frustration for doctors is that the thousands of gunshot wound victims surgeons treat in their hospitals every year will never get the same attention.\n\nThe ones who die in his operating room become \u201cchilled into my memory,\u201d he said. Often he is the one who tells the families in the waiting room, and sometimes his scrubs are bloody so he has to change them first. The families are sometimes inconsolable but other times, Sakran said, they want to tell him about the person they lost.\n\nMany of them are young, he said, reminding him of himself that night in 1994.\n\n\u201cSometimes I think about what my own family must have felt when the surgeon walked out to talk to them,\u201d he said.", "This photo provided Wednesday Nov.14, 2018 by Fondation 30 Millions d\u2019Amis (30 Million Friends Foundation) shows a lion cub found by police in a Lamborghini on Paris\u2019 famed Champs-Elysees avenue, Monday, Nov. 12, 2018 in Paris.

(Fondation 30 Millions d\u2019Amis via AP) (Associated Press)\n\nPARIS \u2014 When Paris police officers found a lion cub in a Lamborghini during a traffic stop this week, they exposed the tip of what animal campaigners say is a bizarre and disturbing new trend: People buying or renting cubs to take bling-bling selfie photos of themselves with a baby big cat.\n\nThe male cub , named Putin but known as Dadou, is less than two months old and likely would have died of poor care had police not stopped the luxury sports car Monday on the Champs-Elysees and rescued the cat, according to 30 Million Friends, the French animal protection NGO now caring for it.\n\n\u201cThere are hundreds of babies going around like this illegally,\u201d the group\u2019s president, Reha Hutin, said in an Associated Press interview Wednesday. \u201cYou can buy a cub for less than a dog. It costs 300 euros (340 dollars) and so they buy them off circuses.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really a disaster,\u201d she said. \u201cThey get these babies and they take selfies with them on social media.\u201d\n\nHutin believes the fad spread to France from Gulf countries.\n\nWealthy people in the Gulf pose with baby cubs and \u201ctake photographs of themselves in the car,\u201d she said. \u201cOnce they grow up they\u2019re just thrown out.\u201d\n\nThe NGO works with a sanctuary in Jordan that already houses 30-40 abandoned wild cats.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s terrible (is) it\u2019s coming to France. We\u2019ve literally saved four babies in the last six months because they are copying those guys,\u201d Hutin said. \u201cLike, \u2018Look at me, look how special I am.\u2019 That\u2019s become a real fashion.\u201d\n\nNot just in France. Another lion cub is adjusting to life in a Dutch big cat center after a jogger ran into it last month in a cage dumped in a field in the central Netherlands.\n\nThe NGO is suing the driver of the sports car, who was taken into custody after police found the cub. Paris police confirmed the find and the arrest. Sports cars are often offered for hire on the Champs-Elysees, for tourists to take short, high-adrenaline rides on the famous avenue and surrounding streets.\n\n\u201cThis was a Lamborghini, a fabulous green Lamborghini and the police noticed that the guy inside had this cub,\u201d she said. \u201cThey stopped him, they took the car, they took the cub and of course we went to get the cub.\u201d\n\nIn a separate case brought by 30 Million Friends, a French court handed a 6-month jail term to another person found with a lion cub, Hutin said.\n\n\u201cWe were very happy to get that. Maybe it will dissuade the others,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Lamborghini cub is the third recovered by 30 Million Friends in a month and the sixth wild cat in under a year. One, a small lioness, was found by the customs brigade in a cage in a garage in the southern French port city of Marseille .\n\nThe NGO is calling for beefed-up government measures against the trafficking of wild animals and their use in French circuses.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the circuses that are breeding them, to have all these new cubs,\u201d Hutin said. \u201cThat\u2019s how these babies, these cubs, are found on (the) Internet ... It\u2019s really become a huge problem.\u201d\n\nThe Lamborghini cub is basically fine, although a health check by a vet found that it was in a weakened state, has a problem with one of its back paws and a broken tail, 30 Million Friends said.\n\nThe cub is now in quarantine in a big cat wildlife park east of Paris and will later join the two cubs recovered by 30 Million Friends in October. The three will probably then be sent to a large park in South Africa, joining three other lions rescued previously in France.\n\n\u201cWe have this plan to regroup them and really have a family,\u201d Hutin said. \u201cWe\u2019ll sort of have this little group of six babies, Parisian babies.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Saturday Nov. 10 2018 (Joe Giddens/PA via AP) (Associated Press)\n\nLONDON \u2014 Claudio Ranieri is back in the Premier League with Fulham, two years after overcoming 5,000-1 odds to win the title with Leicester.\n\nThe 67-year-old Italian coach was hired Wednesday by Fulham, which announced the firing of Slavisa Jokanovic at the same time. The London club is in last place in the league.\n\n\u201cThe objective at Fulham should never be to merely survive in the Premier League,\u201d Ranieri said in a statement. \u201cWe must at all times be a difficult opponent and should expect to succeed. This Fulham squad has exceptional talent that is contrary to its position in the table.\u201d\n\nJokanovic led Fulham back into the Premier League after a four-year absence but the team has only one win and five points from 12 matches.\n\nFulham, which is owned by American billionaire Shad Khan, next plays Southampton on Nov. 24.\n\n\u201cMaking a change without having the right answer or succession plan was not an option, so having someone of Claudio\u2019s caliber ready to accept our challenge was comforting but, most of all, essential,\u201d said Khan, who also owns the NFL\u2019s Jacksonville Jaguars.\n\n\u201cClaudio is risk-free and ready-made for the Premier League, and particularly so for what we need at this moment at Fulham.\u201d\n\nFulham said Khan and his son Tony, who is vice chairman, spoke to coaching candidates over the last week before Ranieri emerged as the \u201cmutual and obvious choice.\u201d\n\nRanieri had previously coached in London at Chelsea from 2000-04. He was fired by Leicester in 2017, nine months after leading to the team to its first-ever English title.\n\n\u201cHis recent body of work with Leicester City is literally legendary, and then you look at Claudio\u2019s experience with Chelsea and big clubs throughout Europe,\u201d Khan said, \u201cand it\u2019s pretty evident we are welcoming an extraordinary football man to Fulham.\u201d\n\nRanieri\u2019s last job ended in May, leaving Nantes halfway through a two-year contract with the French club. Ranieri won\u2019t have complete control at Fulham, which said Tony Khan will continue to oversee transfers and player contracts as director of football operations.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Gregg DeGuire/Getty Images) (Gregg Deguire/Getty Images)\n\nIf Monica Lewinsky were ever to come face to face with Hillary Clinton, she knows exactly what she would do: apologize.\n\n\u201cI know that I would summon up whatever force I needed to again acknowledge to her \u2014 sincerely \u2014 how very sorry I am,\u201d Lewinsky wrote in an essay published by Vanity Fair on Tuesday.\n\nApologizing to Clinton again \u2014 the first time was in a 1999 interview with Barbara Walters \u2014 was one of several topics Lewinsky addressed in an essay that went beyond explaining her decision to participate in a new A&E documentary series, \u201cThe Clinton Affair,\u201d which delves into the events leading up to the impeachment of President Bill Clinton. Lewinsky, 45, also discussed the power dynamics that protected Clinton and led to her public excoriation as well as whether she believes he owes her a personal apology.\n\nThe series, Lewinsky wrote, is titled \u201cThe Clinton Affair\u201d for a reason.\n\n\u201cBye-bye, Lewinsky scandal. . . . I think 20 years is enough time to carry that mantle,\u201d she wrote.\n\nThe first episode will air Sunday.\n\nLewinsky, then a 22-year-old White House intern, became the center of global attention for her affair with Clinton that nearly ended his presidency. He lied about it before a grand jury led by special prosecutor Kenneth Starr, an act that led to impeachment proceedings. Widely vilified and slapped by Clinton and his supporters with the unforgiving moniker of \u201cThat Woman,\u201d just one of many unflattering epithets, Lewinsky took herself out of the public eye, reemerging only just a few years ago.\n\nBecause of the taunting Lewinsky endured, she has since taken on the cause of anti-bullying. In the past, she has been reluctant to publicly address questions about the scandal, but now she is opening up about the infamous relationship in what may be her most expansive interview.\n\n\u201cThroughout history, women have been traduced and silenced,\u201d she wrote. \u201cNow, it\u2019s our time to tell our own stories in our own words.\u201d\n\nLewinsky continued: \u201cYes, the process of filming has been exceedingly painful. But I hope that by participating, by telling the truth about a time in my life \u2014 a time in our history \u2014 I can help ensure that what happened to me never happens to another young person in our country again.\u201d\n\n[Read the full essay here]\n\nLewinsky wrote that she was interviewed for the documentary for more than 20 hours, a process that required her to recall memories she wishes she could erase.\n\n\u201cFilming the documentary forced me to acknowledge to myself past behavior that I still regret and feel ashamed of,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThere were many, many moments when I questioned not just the decision to participate but my sanity itself.\u201d\n\nIn one teaser clip released Tuesday, Lewinsky said she still feels \u201cuncomfortable\u201d talking about the affair, which didn\u2019t stop her from doing so.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not as if it didn\u2019t register with me that he was the president,\u201d she said. \u201cObviously it did. But I think in one way, the moment we were actually in the back office for the first time, the truth is that I think it meant more to me that someone who other people desired, desired me. However wrong it was, however misguided, for who I was in that very moment at 22 years old, that was how it felt.\u201d\n\nIn the series, Lewinsky recounted the crush she began developing on Clinton and how \u201cflirtatious encounters\u201d soon escalated, Fox News Channel reported.\n\nAt a birthday party for a staff member in November 1995, Lewinsky said, she realized that the top of her underwear had been showing, according to People.\n\n\u201cI thought, \u2018Well, I\u2019ll up the game,' \" she said. \u201cI knew [Clinton] was walking out of a room, and instead of putting my trousers up, like I would have done in any other instance, I didn\u2019t. It was unnoticeable to everybody else in the room, but he noticed.\u201d\n\nThen, Lewinsky said she remembered Clinton talking to her and asking her questions, adding, \u201cI don\u2019t think at that point in my life my heart had ever beat as fast.\u201d\n\n\u201cI blurted out, \u2018You know, I have a crush on you,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cAnd he laughed and smiled and then asked me if I wanted to go to the back office. And I did.\u201d\n\nThe office, Lewinsky recalled, was dark and Clinton \u201ceventually asked\u201d to kiss her. She said yes.\n\nLater that evening, Lewinsky said she was the only person in the office when Clinton came in and told her if she wanted to meet him in the \u201cback study,\u201d she could. Lewinsky did, \u201cand it became more intimate from there,\u201d she said.\n\nThe rest of the story was described in what has been called a lurid report to the House that led to Clinton\u2019s impeachment on two articles: lying under oath to a federal grand jury and obstructing justice. After a trial, the Senate acquitted him on Feb. 12, 1999.\n\nIn the aftermath of the affair, facing questions from the FBI and unable to escape public scrutiny, Lewinsky contemplated suicide.\n\n\u201cThere was a point for me somewhere in this sort of first several hours [of being interviewed by the FBI] where I would be hysterically crying and then I would just shut down,\u201d Lewinsky said in another clip released Tuesday. \u201cI remember looking out the window and thinking that the only way to fix this was to kill myself, was to jump out the window.\u201d\n\nCrying again as she spoke in the documentary, she added that she felt \u201cterrible.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was scared, and I was just mortified and afraid of what this was going to do to my family,\u201d she said. \u201cI know I was still in love with Bill at the time, so I felt really responsible.\u201d\n\nBeing part of the series led Lewinsky to \u201cnew rooms of shame\u201d and delivered her to \u201cGrief\u2019s doorstep,\u201d she wrote in the Vanity Fair essay.\n\nBut, despite the challenges that came with reliving the \u201cmost painful and traumatic\u201d parts of her life, Lewinsky wrote that she knew this would be a chance for her to offer her perspective on a narrative that men have largely controlled for years. She noted that the new series is helmed by Emmy Award-winning director Blair Foster and four out of five of its executive producers are women.\n\n\u201cI may not like everything that has been put in the series or left out, but I like that the perspective is being shaped by women,\u201d she wrote.\n\nLewinsky also criticized the power disparity that contributed to her public humiliation, suggesting that Clinton emerged from the scandal relatively unscathed.\n\nTake, for example, Clinton\u2019s famed Oval Office address in which he declared, \u201cI did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky.\u201d\n\nIn that moment, akin to a \u201csports coach signposting the playbook for the big game,\u201d Clinton \u201cthrew down the gauntlet,\u201d Lewinsky wrote.\n\n\u201cWith that, the demonization of Monica Lewinsky began,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAs it so often does, power throws a protective cape around the shoulders of the man, and he dictates the spin by denigrating the less powerful woman.\u201d\n\nClinton\u2019s position of power continued to benefit him, Lewinsky said, pointing out how the former president was rarely asked in interviews to directly address the scandal.\n\n\u201cIf you want to know what power looks like, watch a man safely, even smugly, do interviews for decades, without ever worrying whether he will be asked the questions he doesn\u2019t want to answer,\u201d she wrote.\n\nBut now, in the #MeToo era, things appear to be changing. Clinton faced widespread backlash earlier this year when he said in a June interview with NBC News \u201cToday\u201d correspondent Craig Melvin that he did not think he owed Lewinsky an apology. Clinton said he had already given multiple public apologies and would not handle the accusations any differently today.\n\nIn the essay, Lewinsky wrote that she, too, had publicly apologized at the time \u2014 directly to Hillary Clinton and Chelsea Clinton. The apology, made during the 1999 interview, contained her \u201cfirst public words after the scandal.\u201d\n\nBeyond whether she thinks she is \u201cowed or deserving\u201d of a personal apology from Bill Clinton, Lewinsky wrote that she thinks he \u201cshould want to apologize.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m less disappointed by him, and more disappointed for him,\u201d she wrote. \u201cHe would be a better man for it . . . and we, in turn, a better society.\"\n\nOn social media, Lewinsky\u2019s essay and news of the forthcoming documentary series were met with mixed reactions.\n\n\u201cThis is a beautiful reflection on victimhood, apologies and the innate power of women narrating their own stories,\u201d HuffPost reporter Emma Gray tweeted about the essay.\n\nNew York Magazine writer Rebecca Traister called it \u201ca smart and compassionate piece.\u201d\n\nWow wow wow this @MonicaLewinsky essay.

It was the first time that a candidate for prime minister has ever been rejected by the 349-seat Riksdagen.\n\nNorlen said he would continue talks with party leaders on Thursday, without giving details.\n\nThe September election produced a hung parliament with the left-leaning side and the center-right bloc securing about 40 percent of the vote each, leaving neither with a majority and paving the way for months of uncertainty and complex coalition talks.\n\nBoth blocs have refused to cooperate with the Sweden Democrats, who made great strides in the election.\n\nAnnie Loof, the leader of the Center Party that voted against Kristersson, said he had broken up the 14-year-old center-right alliance by suggesting a two-party government, leaving out her party and the Liberals.\n\nKristersson said that that although the alliance has suffered \u201cits worst crisis,\u201d it is not dead.\n\n\u201cWe have a common platform, but we cannot agree when it comes to taking power.\u201d\n\nCaretaker Prime Minister Stefan Lofven, who heads Sweden\u2019s largest party \u2014 the Social Democrats \u2014 said he was willing to discuss with Loof should she be tapped to try to form a coalition.\n\nLoof earlier said that she doesn\u2019t want to be prime minister herself but is willing to try form a government.\n\nPundits say either Loof or Lofven would be next in line to try to form a government.\n\nThe emergence of Sweden Democrats \u2014 with roots in a neo-Nazi movement \u2014 reflects how deeply that Sweden is being transformed by migration.\n\nIn 2015, Sweden took in a record 163,000 migrants \u2014 the highest per capita of any European country. Since then, the country has sharply restricted immigration, but many Swedes complain that society cannot cope with integrating so many newcomers, many of them Muslims from Africa and the Middle East.\n\nAhead of Wednesday\u2019s vote, Jimmie Akesson, the leader of the Sweden Democrats, said he sees \u201ca new political landscape mushroom in Sweden, exactly like in the rest of the western world.\u201d\n\n___\n\nJan M.

(Bernat Armangue, Pool/Associated Press)\n\nSINGAPORE \u2014 Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi rebuffed criticism from U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and other leaders Wednesday over her government\u2019s treatment of its ethnic Rohingya Muslims.\n\nIn a meeting on the sidelines of a regional summit in Singapore, Pence told Suu Kyi that he was anxious to hear about progress in resolving the crisis, which stems from a violent military crackdown in Myanmar\u2019s Rakhine state that the United Nations has called ethnic cleansing.\n\n\u201cThe violence and persecution by military and vigilantes that resulted in driving 700,000 Rohingya to Bangladesh is without excuse,\u201d Pence said.\n\nHe added that he was eager to hear about how Myanmar will enable the Rohingya to voluntarily return home.

Pence is attending that and the summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Papua New Guinea later this week in President Donald Trump\u2019s stead.\n\nA day earlier Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed made an unusually harsh public criticism of Suu Kyi, saying that as a former political prisoner she should better understand suffering. He said the treatment of the Rohingya was \u201cindefensible.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, Mahathir toned down his comments, saying that ASEAN leaders try to avoid criticizing each other. He said the issue of Rohingya had come up during a working dinner among the leaders but the main sentiment was a desire to resolve the problem.\n\nSuu Kyi became an icon for democracy after spending about 15 years under house arrest for opposing Myanmar\u2019s earlier military dictatorship.\n\nThough she has been the de facto head of Myanmar\u2019s civilian government since her party swept elections in 2015, she is limited in her control of the country by a constitution written under the former military junta. The military is in charge of security operations, including those in Rakhine.\n\nStill, Suu Kyi has faced widespread criticism for not speaking out in defense of the Rohingya. Amnesty International became the latest organization to strip her of an award this week, citing the \u201cshameful betrayal of the values she once stood for.\u201d\n\nResponding to Pence, Suu Kyi said it was good to exchange views, but that \u201cwe understand our country better than any other country does. I\u2019m sure you will say the same of yours, that you understand your own country better than anybody else.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo we are in a better position to explain to you what is happening, how we see things panning out,\u201d she said.\n\nAfter the meeting, senior U.S. administration officials said Pence and Suu Kyi had discussed the importance of having Rohingya return home, but only on a voluntary basis, with safety and dignity.\n\nPence also urged Suu Kyi to pardon the imprisoned journalists.\n\nMyanmar\u2019s government and most of the nation\u2019s Buddhist majority say Rohingya are \u201cBengalis\u201d who migrated illegally from Bangladesh, and do not acknowledge the Muslim minority as a local ethnic group even though they have lived in Myanmar for generations.\n\nA Bangladesh official said Wednesday that authorities are ready to begin repatriating more than 2,200 Rohingya refugees to Myanmar. Bangladesh repatriation commissioner Abul Kalam said 30 refugee families would be transferred Thursday at the Gundrum border point near Cox\u2019s Bazar, where refugees have been living in cramped camps.\n\nU.N. officials have urged Bangladesh to move cautiously on the repatriation plans, saying such a move would endanger their lives.\n\nThe office of U.N. human rights chief Michelle Bachelet said it continues to receive reports of rights violations in Rakhine state, \u201cwhich include allegations of killings, disappearances and arbitrary arrests.\u201d It said some 130,000 people, including many Rohingya, remain internally displaced in central Rakhine.\n\nThe U.N. refugee agency UNHCR also has advised against the returns, saying safety should be assessed first.

The prime minister was due to make a statement outside once it finished.\n\nEarlier, May told lawmakers in the House of Commons that the draft deal \u201ctakes us significantly closer to delivering what the British people voted for in the referendum\u201d of 2016 that opted to leave the EU.\n\nMay said Britain would \u201ctake back control of our borders, our laws and our money ... while protecting jobs, security and the integrity of our United Kingdom.\u201d\n\nShe said the Cabinet \u201cwill decide on the next steps in the national interest.\u201d\n\nBut pro-Brexit lawmakers in May\u2019s Conservative Party \u2014 a group that includes some members of the Cabinet \u2014 say the agreement will leave Britain tethered to the EU after it departs and unable to forge an independent trade policy.\n\nEuroskeptic Conservative legislator Peter Bone warned May that she would \u201close the support of many Conservative (members of Parliament) and millions of voters across the country\u201d if she pressed ahead with the agreement.\n\nMay\u2019s supporters argue that the deal is the best on offer, and the alternatives are a chaotic \u201cno-deal\u201d Brexit that would cause huge disruption to people and businesses, or an election that could see the Conservative government replaced by the left-of-center Labour Party.\n\nFormer Foreign Secretary William Hague warned \u201cardent Brexiteers\u201d that if they shoot down May\u2019s deal, it could lead to a change of government and a new referendum and \u201cBrexit might never happen at all.\u201d\n\nFailure to secure Cabinet backing will leave May\u2019s leadership in doubt and the Brexit process in chaos, with exit day just over four months away on March 29.\n\nIf the Cabinet supports the deal, it still must be approved by leaders of the 28-nation EU. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said EU leaders had penciled in a Nov. 25 Brexit summit to discuss the deal \u2014 though he cautioned nothing was guaranteed and much could still go wrong.\n\nThen May will need to win backing from Britain\u2019s Parliament \u2014 no easy task, since pro-Brexit and pro-EU legislators alike are threatening to oppose it.\n\nThe main obstacle to a withdrawal agreement has long been how to ensure there are no customs posts or other checks along the border between the U.K.\u2019s Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland after Brexit. Britain and the EU agree that there must be no barriers that could disrupt businesses and residents on either side of the border and undermine Northern Ireland\u2019s hard-won peace process.\n\nThe proposed solution involves a common customs arrangement for the U.K. and the EU, to eliminate the need for border checks, with some provisions that are specific to Northern Ireland.\n\nThe solution is intended to be temporary, but pro-Brexit politicians in Britain fear it may become permanent, hampering Britain\u2019s ability to strike new trade deals around the world.\n\nPro-Brexit former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said the agreement would make his favored option, a loose Canada-style trade deal with the bloc, impossible. He tweeted: \u201cCabinet must live up to its responsibilities & stop this deal.\u201d\n\nNorthern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party, which props up May\u2019s minority government, said it would oppose any deal that leaves Northern Ireland subject to different rules to the rest of the U.K. after Brexit.\n\n\u201cWe could not as unionists support a deal that broke up the United Kingdom,\u201d DUP leader Arlene Foster said.\n\nMay also faced disquiet from Scottish Conservative lawmakers, worried about what the deal means for Scotland\u2019s important fishing industry.\n\nThe party\u2019s Scottish legislators \u2014 including Scottish Secretary David Mundell, a Cabinet minister \u2014 wrote to May saying Brexit must mean \u201cfull sovereignty over domestic waters\u201d and Britain must leave the EU\u2019s Common Fisheries Policy after Brexit.\n\nMay also faces growing opposition from pro-EU lawmakers, who say her proposed Brexit deal is worse than the status quo and the British public should get a new vote on whether to leave or to stay.\n\nSophie in \u2018t Veld, a Dutch member of the European Parliament who is deputy to the legislature\u2019s Brexit chief Guy Verhofstadt, said the real problem during the negotiations \u201clies within the U.K.\u201d because Britain doesn\u2019t know what relationship it wants with the EU.\n\n\u201cThat is the real problem, because if the U.K. had a single agreed line, backed by the majority of parties and the majority of MPs, then the whole situation would not be so unclear,\u201d she said.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

It was tiny.\n\nBut the snatching of a baby meerkat from a zoo has not only become a major story in the Australian city of Perth, it has led to the arrest of three people.\n\nIn September, Perth Zoo was ready to publicly show off its new month-old meerkitten to the public and media, but a day before its planned debut, it was gone.\n\nWorried zoo staff said the male baby, who hadn\u2019t yet been named, had apparently got out of its nest box, and feared it may have been snatched by a bird of prey.\n\nBut the other possible reason for its disappearance \u2014 theft \u2014 was also explored.\n\nPolice were called to investigate, and two days later they found the missing meerkat \u2014 at a house 130 kilometers (80 miles) away, in the town of Beverley.\n\nPolice charged two people who had visited the zoo over the furry heist. Jesse Ray Hooker, 23, was charged with stealing, while his friend Aimee Cummins, also 23, with receiving stolen goods.\n\nOn Wednesday police charged a third person, a 31-year-old woman, also from Beverley, with possessing stolen property.\n\nHooker appeared in Perth Magistrates Court, also on Wednesday, where defense lawyer Chad Silver said that he \u201cfell in love\u201d with the newborn meerkat as it ran toward him in its enclosure and had scooped it up and put it in his cooler bag.\n\nHe had then played loud music on the drive home to Beverley so that Cummins, unaware of the heist at the time, couldn\u2019t hear the animal\u2019s distressed cries. After a stop at McDonald\u2019s, the pair took the meerkitten home, adding it to a menagerie of four dogs and a cat.\n\nSilver told the court Hooker was in the process of returning the meerkat when the police called. In the tiny town of Beverley, population 1,700, even a secret that small was apparently too hard to keep.\n\n\u201cThe simplicity of the offence meant the police were able to capture and follow up the meerkat very quickly,\u201d Silver told the court.\n\nIn front of a large media contingent, Hooker pleaded guilty and was fined 4,000 Australian dollars ($2,800). Cummins would have faced her verdict, but Silver said she could not attend the hearing, citing medical reasons and intense media pressure.\n\nShe\u2019ll appear in person in January. The 31-year-old woman will face court next month.\n\nAs for the meerkitten, despite fears from zoo staff his mob would reject him, he\u2019s been welcomed back into the fold and given a name from the East African language of Kiswahili: Salama, which means \u201csafe.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

As you know, congressman, the tax cut plan lowered all income levels, and they double the standard deduction. So that talking point . . .\n\nCICILLINE: Maria, that\u2019s just not true.\n\nBARTIROMO: No, it is true.\n\nCICILLINE: Maria, that\u2019s just not true. An independent outside group said 83 percent of that tax cut goes to the top 1 percent, the richest people in this country, the most profitable corporations.

We created a $2 trillion deficit by giving 83 percent of the tax cut to the top 1 percent. And now Republicans are proposing to cut Social Security and Medicare to pay for that. That\u2019s not acceptable.\n\nBARTIROMO: Look, I understand that you want to keep with this talking point that is inaccurate. That\u2019s fine.\n\nCICILLINE: No, it\u2019s a fact.\n\nBARTIROMO: You can do as you will.\n\nCICILLINE: It\u2019s not inaccurate.\n\n\u2014 exchange on Fox News\u2019s \u201cSunday Morning Futures,\u201d Nov. 11, 2018\n\nThis is a classic Washington moment \u2014 a prominent journalist and a lawmaker arguing over whether a factoid is accurate. Bartiromo tried to fact-check Cicilline in real time \u2014 \u201cthe tax cut plan lowered all income levels, and they double the standard deduction\u201d \u2014 and Cicilline insisted he was right.\n\n\u201cThat is inaccurate,\u201d Bartiromo declared. \u201cNo, it\u2019s a fact,\u201d Cicilline shot back.\n\nBartiromo is a conservative, and Cicilline is a Democrat. This is yet another example of how Democrats and Republicans talk past each other when they discuss the Trump tax cut, with Republicans looking at the front end while Democrats tend to focus only on the back end.\n\nWe\u2019ve shown how House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) touted \u201cCindy,\u201d the single mom who supposedly will get $700 every year from the tax bill and how House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) claimed 86 million people would see their taxes increase. Let\u2019s dissect Cicilline\u2019s talking point.\n\nThe Facts\n\nIn 2018, most U.S. taxpayers can expect some kind of tax cut, according to just about every analysis. The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center found that initially more than 80 percent of taxpayers would get a tax cut, with less than 5 percent getting a tax increase.\n\nSince the wealthy pay most of the income taxes, they end up with most of the tax cuts. (The top 1 percent in 2014 earned 20 percent of adjusted gross income and paid nearly 40 percent of federal taxes, according to the Tax Foundation.) The TPC report shows that in 2018, the top 1 percent would get 20.5 percent of the tax cuts; the top quintile would get 65.3 percent. In other words, that\u2019s not nearly as lopsided as Cicilline asserted.\n\nSo, score one for Bartiromo?\n\nNot so fast! Richard Luchette, a Cicilline spokesman, pointed to the same TPC study to defend the use of the statistic.\n\nIn 2027, the study shows, 82.8 percent of the tax cuts will flow to the top 1 percent. The top quintile actually receives 107.3 percent of the tax changes \u2014 because taxes actually increase for the folks in the lowest, second-lowest and middle quintiles. It\u2019s right there on Page 5 of the report.\n\nWhat happened? The individual tax cuts expire over the course of the decade. Republicans structured the tax cut this way to keep the whole package \u2014 especially the corporate tax cut \u2014 in a budget box that allowed only for a $1.5 trillion increase in the federal deficit over 10 years.\n\nThe assumption \u2014 possibly a big one \u2014 is that Congress will vote to extend the tax cuts when they begin to expire, just as most of the George W. Bush tax cuts were extended, with the eventual support of Democrats who had long opposed the Bush-era cuts.\n\nBut the law is the law. It certainly is within Cicilline\u2019s right to focus on the 2027 tax tables that show that the tax cuts tilted dramatically toward the richest of the rich.\n\nBut in standing his ground in his Fox News interview, Cicilline failed to make clear that he was talking about 2027, the end of the 10-year window. In fact, he confusingly says that \u201cwe need a tax cut for middle-class families, not 83 percent of it going to the top 1 percent, richest people in this country,\u201d which suggests that there is no tax cut now for the middle class. There is one; the question is whether Congress will extend it or even improve it when it starts to lapse.\n\nOther Democrats have been more adept about adding phrases such as \u201cin the long run\u201d or \u201cby the end of the decade\u201d when citing the 2027 data. But Cicilline did not do that in this interview.\n\n\u201cUnder that law, tax cuts for the middle class are temporary,\u201d Luchette said. \u201cDavid supports a permanent middle-class tax cut and repealing the tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations so we can invest in infrastructure. But the stat he cited referred to the law as Republicans and President Trump wrote and enacted it.\u201d\n\nThe Pinocchio Test\n\nWe have tended to give politicians on both sides of the aisle Two Pinocchios for telling only half of the story of the tax bill. Given past performance by Congress, we would be shocked if lawmakers simply let the tax bill run its course and allowed it to raise taxes on tens of millions of Americans. Moreover, it is important for Cicilline to signal to viewers that he is not talking about this tax year, when many can expect to pay less in federal income taxes. So he earns two Pinocchios.\n\nTwo Pinocchios\n\n(About our rating scale)\n\nSend us facts to check by filling out this form\n\nSign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter\n\nThe Fact Checker is a verified signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network code of principles", "Israeli protesters hold flags during a demonstration against the cease-fire between Israel and Gaza\u2019s Hamas in the southern Israeli city of Ashkelon, Wednesday, Nov. 14, 2018. Israel\u2019s defense minister on Wednesday abruptly resigned to protest a new cease-fire with Hamas militants in Gaza, throwing the government into turmoil and pushing the country toward an early election. (Tsafrir Abayov/Associated Press)\n\nJERUSALEM \u2014 Israel\u2019s defense minister on Wednesday abruptly resigned to protest a new cease-fire with Hamas militants in Gaza, throwing the government into turmoil and pushing the country toward an early election.\n\nAvigdor Lieberman\u2019s decision was ostensibly a show of anger over Tuesday\u2019s informal truce with Israel\u2019s Hamas enemies. But in many ways, it was the opening round of a new political campaign.\n\nHis defection leaves Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with the narrowest of parliamentary majorities \u2014 only 61 of 120 seats in his coalition.\n\nIn theory, Netanyahu can continue to govern until parliamentary elections scheduled for a year from now. But with another coalition rival, Naftali Bennett, threatening to leave the coalition if he doesn\u2019t get the defense portfolio, the days of Netanyahu\u2019s government appear numbered.\n\nHere\u2019s a closer look at the developments:\n\nNETANYAHU\u2019S CEASE-FIRE\n\nAfter two days of heavy fighting, Netanyahu\u2019s decision to accept the Egyptian-brokered truce was more than a case of cooler heads prevailing.\n\nThe longtime Israeli leader knows well that the military option has its limits. Israel has maintained a crippling blockade on Gaza and fought three wars against Hamas since the Islamic militant group seized power in 2007. This has inflicted heavy damage on Gaza, but Hamas remains firmly in power.\n\nOusting the group would require a military operation that could take months and cost the lives of thousands of Palestinian civilians and many Israeli soldiers. Reluctant to pay such a price, Netanyahu instead seems content to keep a weakened Hamas in check.\n\nNetanyahu may also have a deeper agenda. Leaving the Palestinians torn between two governments \u2014 Hamas in Gaza and the internationally backed Palestinian Authority in the West Bank \u2014 works in his favor.\n\nWith the Palestinians weak and divided, there is little pressure for Netanyahu to make concessions, allowing him to expand West Bank settlements and cement Israeli control over the territory.\n\nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has repeatedly accused Israel and the U.S. of collaborating behind his back and preparing a peace plan offering the Palestinians a mini-state in the Gaza Strip and small autonomous areas of the West Bank. That falls short of his demand for a fully independent Palestinian state that includes both territories in full.\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t true that Netanyahu doesn\u2019t have a policy. He does: He is a firm believer in perpetuating the status quo,\u201d wrote Israeli columnist Nahum Barnea.\n\nBIBI\u2019S BOUNCER\n\nLieberman is a former aide to Netanyahu who has been both an ally and rival over the years. He currently heads Yisrael Beitenu, a small ultranationalist party that appeals to immigrants from the former Soviet Union.\n\nA brawny former nightclub bouncer known for his sharp tongue and Russian-accented Hebrew, the Soviet-born Lieberman has sought to project an image as a gruff, tough-talking politician. At times, he has been critical of Israel\u2019s Arab minority, liberal opposition groups and even Israel\u2019s Arab ally Egypt. Sitting in the opposition, he once threatened to assassinate Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh if he held the defense portfolio.\n\nBut as defense minister, Lieberman\u2019s accomplishments remain limited, and Haniyeh is alive and well in Gaza.\n\nCalling the cease-fire \u201csurrender to terrorism,\u201d Lieberman also made clear that his frustrations run much deeper. He said he also opposed a recent decision to allow Qatar to deliver $15 million in aid to Gaza and the cancellation, under heavy international pressure, of the planned demolition of a Bedouin village in the West Bank.\n\n\u201cWe are buying quiet in the short-term at the cost of severe damage to our security in the long-term,\u201d he said. \u201cThe weakness we displayed also projects itself to other arenas.\u201d\n\nIS NETANYAHU THREATENED?\n\nIf Netanyahu calls early elections, opinion polls forecast a broad victory by his Likud Party and his hard-line partners, including Lieberman.\n\nWith his resignation, Lieberman appears to be positioning himself for elections by painting Netanyahu as soft and portraying himself as a defense hawk.\n\nBennett, another former Netanyahu aide who leads the religious Jewish Home Party, is likely to use a similar strategy. Like Lieberman, Bennett had favored tougher military action against Hamas.\n\nAll three appeal to a similar bloc of voters. Although Netanyahu would likely emerge as the leader, siphoning off votes would strengthen his rivals and give them increased leverage.\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s rivals are eager to tap into public anger over the cease-fire. Residents in rocket-battered towns in southern Israel, typically Likud strongholds, have protested the truce.\n\nLieberman is especially desperate. His party holds only five Knesset seats, barely above the threshold required to enter the parliament.\n\nNetanyahu, meanwhile, will probably market himself as the responsible adult in a room of inexperienced children.\n\n\u201cI see the big picture of Israeli security that I cannot share with the public,\u201d he said Wednesday as he defended the cease-fire. \u201cIn times like these, leadership is not doing the easy thing. Leadership is doing the right thing, even if it is hard. Leadership is sometime facing criticism.\u201d\n\nOne wild card: Police have recommended indicting Netanyahu in a series of corruption investigations. If Israel\u2019s attorney general decides to file charges, Netanyahu could be weakened or even forced to step down, shaking up any election campaign. However, if he is re-elected before a decision is made, it could make it much harder to press charges against a leader with a fresh mandate. Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit has not said when he will decide.\n\nHAPPY HAMAS\n\nIn Gaza, Hamas declared victory in the latest round of fighting, boasting that it stood up to the powerful Israeli military. Large crowds of supporters celebrated in the streets.\n\n\u201cThe resistance has sent a clear message to the occupation that it can hurt them,\u201d boasted Ismail Radwan, a Hamas spokesman.\n\nAfter the dust settles, Hamas will once again have to cope with running a territory where unemployment is over 50 percent, the economy is in tatters and where people cannot travel abroad.\n\n\u201cWe have to bear in mind that Hamas\u2019 popularity has improved on similar occasions in the past,\u201d said Mkheimer Abusada, a Gaza analyst. \u201cBut that was for a short period of time, after which people would face the harsh reality of unemployment and poverty.\u201d\n\nHamas will return its focus toward U.N. and Egyptian mediation aimed at easing the crippling Israeli blockade in exchange for assurances of quiet.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The United Nations says the atrocities could be tantamount to genocide and have sent more than 700,000 refugees pouring into neighboring Bangladesh.\n\nSuu Kyi requested Wednesday\u2019s meeting with Pence on the sidelines of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summits in Singapore.\n\nShe has also been criticized by some in the 10-member ASEAN bloc, despite its long-standing policy of nonintervention in the affairs of other states in the group. Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, the organization\u2019s elder statesman, said in comments to reporters Tuesday that Suu Kyi was \u201ctrying to defend what is indefensible\u201d by failing to condemn the Myanmar military for its actions.\n\n\u201cThey are actually oppressing these people to the point of killing them, mass killing,\u201d he reportedly said.\n\n[A year after the assault on the Rohingya, Myanmar\u2019s generals are unapologetic]\n\nA senior White House official said Pence also pressed Suu Kyi \u201cmultiple times\u201d on pardoning two Reuters journalists, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, who have been sentenced to jail for violating the country\u2019s colonial-era secrets act \u2014 charges widely seen as politically motivated. The pair were reporting on the massacre of 10 Muslim Rohingya men, part of the broader crackdown that occurred in August 2017, when they were arrested in December.\n\nThe official declined to comment on Suu Kyi\u2019s response on the journalists or whether Pence was satisfied with it.\n\nIn his opening remarks before the bilateral meeting, Pence said he was \u201clooking forward\u201d to speaking with Suu Kyi about the \u201cpremium\u201d his country and administration places on a free and independent press.\n\n\u201cIn America, we believe in our democratic institutions and our ideals, including a free and independent press,\u201d Pence said. \u201cThe arrest and jailing of two journalists last fall was deeply troubling to millions of Americans.\u201d\n\nPence\u2019s defense of the media, however, contrasts with President Trump\u2019s disparaging attacks against some U.S. journalists and repeated smears calling news organizations the \u201cenemy of the people.\u201d\n\nOthers have joined the United States in calling for Myanmar to address the Rohingya issue, including the underlying and long-standing conditions that have made the minority vulnerable to violence and sometimes prompt Rohingya to flee to neighboring countries such as Malaysia and Thailand to escape the persecution. The Rohingya say they are native to Myanmar, but Myanmar considers them to be illegal immigrants from neighboring Bangladesh and denies them citizenship rights.\n\nMyanmar has also insisted that the August 2017 crackdown was in response to Rohingya militant attacks and has denied charges of ethnic cleansing or genocide.\n\nSingapore, which chairs ASEAN this year, has pushed behind the scenes to get Suu Kyi and other Myanmar leaders to understand the severity of the crisis they are facing, say regional diplomats.\n\n\u201cIf Myanmar drifts back into pariah status through international and other sanctions, it could pull the whole of ASEAN down with it,\u201d said Kobsak Chutikul, a retired ambassador and former member of Thailand\u2019s parliament who was involved in an advisory board on the Rohingya crisis until he quit in July over concerns that it was ineffective. \u201cContinued ASEAN centrality and relevance is considered extremely important by all members. Myanmar\u2019s condition threatens this \u2014 at the least, it is bad PR.\u201d\n\nSuu Kyi has also lost a string of international accolades awarded to her when she was under house arrest for most of two decades for standing up to Myanmar\u2019s military junta and demanding democratic rule. Amnesty International withdrew its highest honor, the Ambassador of Conscience Award, from Suu Kyi on Sunday.\n\n\u201cToday, we are profoundly dismayed that you no longer represent a symbol of hope, courage, and the undying defense of human rights,\u201d Kumi Naidoo, the rights group\u2019s secretary general, wrote in a letter to Suu Kyi that the group made public. \u201cAmnesty International cannot justify your continued status as a recipient of the Ambassador of Conscience award and so with great sadness we are hereby withdrawing it from you.\u201d\n\nOf particular and immediate concern, rights groups say, is the imminent repatriation of thousands of Rohingya from Bangladesh to Myanmar. The United Nations says that conditions are unsuitable for the safe return of the Rohingya to their home country, and the International Crisis Group has warned that a rushed return could trigger violence.\n\nMyanmar\u2019s strategic location \u2014 on China\u2019s southwestern border \u2014 has made the country especially important to Washington. The senior White House official also said that Pence in Wednesday\u2019s meeting warned Suu Kyi against falling into the trap of debt diplomacy \u2014 a thinly veiled reference to China, whose Belt and Road Initiative is seen as a tool to extend political influence through infrastructure building while putting countries on the hook for billions of dollars in debt.\n\nChina has signed an agreement to build a massive economic corridor through Myanmar and is developing a $1.3 billion port close to the Indian Ocean.\n\nThe United States has stressed to its allies in China\u2019s backyard that Washington offers an alternative to investment from Beijing. Pence emphasized American commitment to the Asia-Pacific region in his bilateral meetings Wednesday, which included encounters with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc.\n\nRead more:\n\nMyanmar judge sentences Reuters journalists to 7 years in jail\n\nEditorial: Myanmar is now erasing the Rohingya\u2019s very name\n\nU.S. sanctions Myanmar military commanders for their role in \u2018ethnic cleansing\u2019\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "This July 11, 2018, photo, shows a fragment of a US-made missile fired from a drone that struck a vehicle, killing all seven men inside on Jan. 26, 2018, instantly ending their lives, shredding their bodies into pieces, in Shabwa, Yemen. (Associated Press)\n\nATAQ, Yemen \u2014 Al-Qaida was giving away motorcycles up in the mountains \u2014 that\u2019s what the kids in town were saying the day Abdullah disappeared.\n\nEarly that morning, Mohsanaa Salem woke her 14-year-old son to go buy vegetables. The sun had just risen above the mountain ridge, and winter light filled the ravine where their mud brick house sat at the foot of a slope. \u201cLet me sleep,\u201d Abdullah groaned from a mattress on the floor, surrounded by his brothers and sisters.\n\nOne word from his father, though, and the boy was up and dressed, trudging out of the house to the market in a neighboring village. Three hours later, when he still hadn\u2019t returned, Mohsanaa and her husband began to worry.\n\nThey were a family trying to get by in Yemen, a nation at war with itself that has become a battleground for more powerful countries.\n\nThey knew that many families like theirs had been caught in the middle, with thousands killed in fighting between Iranian-backed rebels from the north, known as Houthis, and forces backed by a Saudi-led coalition trying to restore the ousted government.\n\nThey knew that al-Qaida militants were based in the mountains, sending fighters out to battle the Houthis, while trying to elude missiles fired from U.S. drones that often killed innocents.\n\nAnd they knew Abdullah was a good boy, though a bit naive. He never strayed far \u2014 just to school or to play soccer with his friends in a lot so close his mother could see it from the house. At about 10 a.m., Mohsanaa and her husband called around to the couple dozen other families who lived in their village to ask if anybody had seen Abdullah.\n\nNo one had, and his parents\u2019 worry grew to panic.\n\n\u2014This story was produced in partnership with the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting.\n\nAll around al-Said district, in Yemen\u2019s southern Shabwa province, people heard the American drone overhead on the morning of Jan. 26.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t unusual. The sky often buzzed with drones hunting for the moment to strike at the al-Qaida militants, a mix of locals, foreign fighters and Yemenis from other parts of the country who had moved into the district.\n\nFrom above, the drone surveyed an inhospitable landscape of barren limestone mountains, creased with ravines and gorges. Zooming in on those threads of green, the drone would have scanned dozens of isolated villages like the one where Abdullah lived, each just a few houses above plots of land planted with wheat and animal fodder.\n\nAbdullah\u2019s village, Shaab Arshan, sits in a wadi just over 100 meters (yards) wide in places, the bare mountains rearing up steeply on either side. Ravines and gorges lead to slightly larger valleys that eventually open into desert, the fringes of the vast Empty Quarter that takes up much of the Arabian Peninsula.\n\nAl-Qaida fighters come down to the valleys to resupply and recruit in the markets. They pass out memory cards with their videos and lectures. They show up at weddings or funerals now and then, preaching to those in attendance. And they offer gifts to teens and young men, the most vulnerable and easily swayed to join their ranks.\n\nFor more than a decade, the United States has waged a drone war against al-Qaida in Yemen, trying to eliminate one of the most dangerous branches of the terror network. The Trump administration has dramatically ramped up drone strikes, carrying out more in two years than the Obama administration did over its entire eight years \u2014 176, compared to 154. More than 300 people \u2014 militants and civilians \u2014 were killed in 2017 and 2018 by one estimate.\n\nAt least 30 civilians were killed in 2018, The Associated Press found, based on accounts from family members and witnesses. A few weeks before Abdullah\u2019s disappearance, a drone\u2019s missile slammed into a farm in a neighboring province, killing a 70-year-old man and a young relative who had just returned from mediating a land dispute.\n\nBut here in al-Said district, it had been months since the last strike.\n\n___\n\nSoon after he left the house, Abdullah ran into a schoolmate who told him al-Qaida militants were giving away motorcycles in the town of Mosaynaa. The friend had heard it from a neighbor who belonged to the group.\n\nAbdullah had never thought of joining al-Qaida and he didn\u2019t want to now. He was in the 8th grade and dreamed of becoming a doctor one day. But he knew how to drive, and he wanted a motorcycle.\n\nThe boys agreed they would go get the motor bikes and come right home.\n\nThey caught a ride to the market in Yashbom, where Abdullah used part of the money his mother had given him to pay for a taxi to Ataq, the provincial capital on the other side of the mountain.\n\nAbdullah loved Ataq \u2014 the closest thing to a city the village boy had seen. His father took him and his siblings there to buy gifts at holiday times and new clothes before the start of school. He always pleaded with his parents to send him to school there as a reward if he made it to the top of his class.\n\nIt was there that his friend had been told to contact the militants who would take them where they needed to go. They had no idea how far away that would be.\n\n___\n\nAbdullah\u2019s parents expanded their search to nearby villages and called relatives in Ataq. No one had seen their boy.\n\nWhat if a driver had hit Abdullah and sped away? He could be lying by the side of the road, or maybe someone found him and took him to a hospital.\n\nAbdullah was their miracle child. Mohsanaa had complications in the pregnancy and gave birth to twins after only seven months. Abdullah\u2019s brother died within days, and doctors were sure Abdullah would die, too. He was tiny, hairless, and there were no incubators at the hospital.\n\n\u201cIf you saw him, you\u2019d think he was a doll, just the size of the palm of your hand,\u201d Mohsanaa said.\n\nWhen Mohsanaa brought Abdullah home, she wouldn\u2019t let anyone near him. She fed him formula. She kept him warm by spreading butter over his body and wrapping him in cotton. Every day, he got better, and by six months \u201che became a normal baby,\u201d she said.\n\nIn an impoverished country where nearly four years of civil war have pushed millions to the brink of starvation, the family had much to be thankful for. Abdullah\u2019s father, Saleh bin Elwiya, worked as a taxi driver and made enough to feed his wife, four sons and four daughters.\n\nSaleh was a careful driver, plying the roads all day as far as Aden, southern Yemen\u2019s biggest city, on the coast. He adored his children and had taught all his sons to drive, except for the youngest, Abdel-Salam, who at 8 couldn\u2019t reach the pedals yet.\n\nHe always urged Abdullah to focus on his schoolwork.\n\n\u201cYou just study, and I will take care of everything else,\u201d Saleh told him. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to end up a taxi driver like I did because I didn\u2019t finish school.\u201d\n\nNow his boy had vanished.\n\nSaleh\u2019s eldest son, Zayad, and a brother-in-law, Nabil, drove out to search the roads. The two were in the army together, on a week\u2019s leave from a front-line unit fighting the Houthi rebels. At every army checkpoint along the way, they described Abdullah to the soldiers, asking if they\u2019d seen him: A tall, lanky boy, baby face, not a trace of whiskers?\n\nFinally, a soldier outside Ataq said yes. He\u2019d seen him passing in a car. It was welcome news: At least they knew Abdullah had made it this far.\n\nSaleh headed for Ataq in his taxi. There, he joined his relatives, searching in the markets and at taxi stands, going street by street, alley by alley through the city. He spoke little, growing more tense with every futile turn.\n\nAs night fell, they gathered at the home of Saleh\u2019s brother in the Russian Compound, a housing complex on the city\u2019s edge, built in the 1980s when Soviet experts were here searching for oil. Zayad called his mother. Still nothing, he told her.\n\nMohsanaa told him to stay there and wait until morning to resume the search. She didn\u2019t want them driving around in the dark.\n\n\u201cThings happen at night,\u201d she said.\n\n___\n\nOn the outskirts of Ataq, Abdullah and his friend met a militant, who drove them in a Land Cruiser along a desert highway to Mosaynaa, through an area where Abdullah had never been before. He realized he had been gone for a long time and hadn\u2019t told his parents where he was. He thought about turning back but didn\u2019t have the nerve to say anything.\n\nThey passed through Mosaynaa, and the car wove up into the mountains to the al-Qaida fighters\u2019 camp. In a tent, they all had a meal of chicken and rice and Pepsi, but there were no motorcycles. It was too late to leave, so they would have to stay the night. The militants gave the boys a phone to send a message to their parents, and Abdullah texted his father: \u201cI am with al-Qaida. I\u2019ll come back tomorrow. Don\u2019t come for me.\u201d\n\nThe boys were offered a tent, but decided to sleep in a nearby crevasse, under some trees. They were worried about airstrikes.\n\n___\n\nWhen he received the message in Ataq, Abdullah\u2019s father tried calling back to the militant\u2019s phone. It was turned off. They had to move right away, Saleh told his relatives, or else \u201cI won\u2019t be able to get him back.\u201d Once in al-Qaida\u2019s hands, Abdullah would be gone forever, sent to fight the Houthis or strapped with a suicide belt \u2014 or he might be hit by a drone.\n\nWith al-Qaida, \u201call roads lead to death,\u201d said one of Saleh\u2019s nephews.\n\nDespite his wife\u2019s warnings, Saleh got back into the taxi and drove into the night, joined by Zayad and Nabil, along with two of Saleh\u2019s nephews who offered to help.\n\nThe search party asked around the shops and eateries still open in the markets. They learned that the boys had been there hours earlier, heading for the mountains.\n\nSaleh had never been to Mosaynaa and didn\u2019t have the tribal links needed to find his son. He needed local help, so he went to one of the few families he knew, the al-Tolsi family.\n\nThe al-Tolsi brothers were beekeepers, a common trade in Yemen, a country known for its honey. One of the brothers had links to al-Qaida, but he wasn\u2019t there when Saleh and his relatives appeared at the door of the family house. Instead, it was another brother, named Mubarak.\n\nMubarak was not connected to al-Qaida and had status in the community, working as the imam at the local mosque and performing the daily call to prayer. He welcomed the men in and offered them dinner. Over the meal, his guests explained why they had come. Mubarak said he was happy to take them to the mountains in the morning. It was too dark now. But Saleh was insistent.\n\nMubarak gave in. The beekeeper and his nephew, Naguib, a geology student at a local oil university, joined them, setting out at 10 p.m. At the foot of the mountains, they sought out a local man known to be a look-out for al-Qaida. He belonged to the same tribe as Mubarak, so they knew they could ask him to take a message to the militants: There is a man here who wants his son back.\n\nAs the look-out went up the mountain, the seven of them waited below in Saleh\u2019s taxi.\n\n___\n\nAt around 11:30 p.m., an operator pressed a button in a U.S. military base \u2014 perhaps in neighboring Saudi Arabia, perhaps as far away as Nevada or Georgia \u2014 launching two Hellfire missiles from a drone cruising above the mountain. Abdullah heard explosions in the valley and, terrified, started to cry.\n\nThe hours passed slowly to daybreak, when Abdullah and his friend made their way down the mountain. Part way down, they saw a mangled car below. At the bottom, Abdullah recognized the license plate: His father\u2019s taxi.\n\nThe missiles had reduced the car to burned wreckage. Abdullah\u2019s father and brother and the other five people inside were torn to pieces.\n\nThere were no bodies. Overnight, militants had rushed to the site and taken the remains to Mosaynaa, but their blood was everywhere.\n\n\u201cIt was shocking. I wept,\u201d Abdullah said. \u201cI realized he had come looking for me.\u201d\n\n____\n\nNews of the deaths in a drone strike fanned out across the district, passed by WhatsApp messages and phone calls.\n\nOne of Mubarak\u2019s brothers, Ahmed al-Tolsi, was away in the neighboring province of Marib, taking their bees to flowers there. He got a message and rushed home to Mosaynaa to bury his kin.\n\n\u201cHe is a generous man who received this family, gave them dinner and told them he would help them bring back their child,\u201d he said of Mubarak. \u201cHe was doing something good and got killed.\u201d\n\nIn Ataq, one of Saleh\u2019s nephews heard a knock on the door at dawn. \u201cYour brothers and uncle are in God\u2019s embrace,\u201d a neighbor said.\n\nThe remains of Saleh and his relatives were taken to the town of Yashbom, where Abdullah\u2019s odyssey began, and laid out under sheets in the mosque. Saleh\u2019s legs were gone; Zayad\u2019s body was cut in half.\n\nIn keeping with Muslim custom, the five were buried right away in the Yashbom cemetery.\n\nAbdullah\u2019s mother woke at dawn for morning prayers, still worrying about Abdullah. At 7:30 a.m., neighbors arrived dressed in black for mourning and told her the news: Saleh and the others had been hit by the drone. They were all dead.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not possible. We talked in the evening,\u201d Mohsanaa said. \u201cI told them not to go out at night.\u201d\n\nShe was terrified that Abdullah had been killed as well.\n\nThen Abdullah appeared. He had walked four hours to get home and found the crowd of mourners gathered at his house. He sat alone under a tree nearby, trembling, afraid he would be blamed, until the men went over and reassured him. Mohsanaa had her son sit beside her and placed her hands on his head.\n\nTribal leaders sent emissaries to the al-Qaida fighters to demand they leave the area. But months later, Abdullah still blamed himself, not al-Qaida or the U.S.\n\n\u201cIt was my all mistake,\u201d Abdullah said. He speaks in short, muddled sentences, stooped over and looking down at his fingers.\n\n\u201cI was the reason why my father and brother, my uncle and cousins all died.\u201d\n\nThe Pentagon confirmed that it carried out a strike in Shabwa province on Jan. 26, saying it was targeting al-Qaida. It does not release details or death tolls in drone strikes, spokeswoman Cmdr. Rebecca Rebarich said.\n\nEver since, the families have tried to prove their slain loved ones were not militants. They gathered letters from everyone they could \u2014 police officers, district officials, tribal leaders, school principals \u2014 certifying that their relatives did not belong to al-Qaida. They spoke to human rights groups and the International Committee of the Red Cross, asking for an investigation.\n\nThey even held a demonstration in Ataq, attended by some 200 people, reading out a statement demanding the U.S. acknowledge that the victims were not al-Qaida and pay compensation to the families.\n\nTheir voices have not been heard. The U.S military has an official mechanism for families to request compensation for relatives mistakenly killed \u2014 a few families in Iraq and Pakistan have succeeded \u2014 but there is no U.S. Embassy in Yemen, so there is nowhere for Saleh\u2019s family to submit evidence that they were civilians.\n\nAbdullah\u2019s family has shards of the missiles that killed the seven men. They keep the shrapnel printed with serial numbers wrapped in a blanket hoping one day to present it as evidence in an investigation.\n\nMohsanaa doesn\u2019t believe she\u2019ll ever see justice for the killing. With her husband gone, she scrapes by on a meager pension and tries to manage her family\u2019s grief. She doesn\u2019t speak of the killing in front of Abdullah. A pious woman, she knows he mustn\u2019t blame himself.\n\n\u201cThis is God\u2019s verdict. If it wasn\u2019t written, they wouldn\u2019t have gone,\u201d Mohsanaa said. \u201cWhat\u2019s the child\u2019s guilt? He is a victim. He\u2019s a poor boy.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Lee Keath in Cairo contributed.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

But refugees scheduled to leave said they would refuse to go because of fears for their safety.\n\nSome said their families have fled from their shanties in the refugee camps to avoid being sent back. The situation remained tense in camps overnight.\n\nRefugees, Repatriation and Rehabilitation Commissioner Abul Kalam said earlier Wednesday that 30 refugee families would be handed over Thursday at the Ghumdhum border point near Cox\u2019s Bazar, where refugees have been living in crammed camps.\n\nBut by late Wednesday, confusion grew over whether it would start.\n\nKalam said late Wednesday that they discussed the situation with the U.N.\u2019s refugee agency, which gave a report after discussion with the refugees who are on the list. The U.N. does not want the government to send the refugees back under current circumstances.\n\nDetails of the repot were not shared, but Kalam said they wanted to be \u201chopeful\u201d in beginning the repatriation on Thursday.\n\n\u201cWe hope we will be able to confirm tomorrow morning (Thursday) how many we are taking,\u201d he said.\n\nThe two countries had originally agreed to begin repatriating Rohingya to Rakhine State last January, but that was called off amid concerns among aid workers and the Rohingya that their safety wasn\u2019t guaranteed.\n\nKalam said about 2,260 refugees from 485 families would be sent back in an initial group. Myanmar officials said recently that they would receive 150 refugees each day.\n\nBut it was unclear whether the repatriation would begin smoothly amid reports that many of the refugees on the initial list have fled.\n\n\u201cI will not go. My wife and other family members have gone elsewhere, they do not want to go,\u201d 35-year-old Nurul Amin told The Associated Press outside the Jamtoli camp, where he and his family have been living for more than a year.\n\n\u201cI stayed back to guard my valuables,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you say you will shoot us if we do not agree to go back, we will welcome bullets, we still will not go.\u201d\n\nMohammed Selim, 23, said his wife and seven other family members went into hiding after finding out that they would be sent back.\n\n\u201cWe are grateful to the Bangladesh government, the Bangladeshi people for their help. Please do not force us to go,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf we need to go, we demand that we go back to our homes, not to any camps there. We have our land, we have our homes,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Sunday, the Myanmar government said it was ready to welcome returning refugees.\n\nIt said returning Rohingya would stay at repatriation camps for two days and receive food and clothing before moving on to transit camps. It said China, India and Japan were \u201cproviding necessary assistance\u201d for the repatriation process.\n\nDespite the promises by Myanmar, human rights activists say conditions are not yet safe for their return.\n\nLast week, the U.N.\u2019s independent investigator for human rights in Myanmar, Yanghee Lee, called the plans \u201crushed\u201d and said she was concerned there were no guarantees that the refugees would be protected from new persecution if they return home.\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross is one of the few humanitarian organizations operating in Rakhine state. Its U.N. observer, Robert Mardini, said Wednesday that conditions are not right for Rohingya refugees to return.\n\nHe told several reporters that the conflict between the Rohingya and Myanmar\u2019s government is not resolved, and \u201cso many\u201d Rohingya villages in northern Rakhine are flattened that there is no place to go back to.\n\n\u201cWe still believe that the conditions are not right for voluntary, safe, dignified returns, and our concerns are for people to be able to move freely, to be safe and secure, and have a normal life,\u201d Mardini said. \u201cNobody can claim today that the security in Rakhine is so well established that people can return safely.\u201d\n\nForeign leaders have criticized Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi this week on the sidelines of a summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Singapore for her handling of the Rohingya crisis.\n\nRohingya began fleeing into Bangladesh after Myanmar security forces launched a brutal crackdown following attacks by an insurgent group on guard posts in August 2017. The scale, organization and ferocity of the operation led to accusations from the international community, including the United Nations, of ethnic cleansing and even genocide. Myanmar\u2019s government has denied the accusations.\n\nMyanmar officials said Sunday that returnees can get an ID document called a national verification card that will allow them to travel in the Maungdaw area of Rakhine state, and that they can then begin to apply for citizenship.\n\nBut there is widespread skepticism that any of returning refugees will ever be granted citizenship.\n\nMost people in Buddhist-majority Myanmar do not accept that the Rohingya Muslims are a native ethnic group. They are viewed as \u201cBengalis\u201d who entered illegally from Bangladesh, even though generations of Rohingya have lived in Myanmar. Nearly all have been denied citizenship since 1982, effectively rendering them stateless. They have also been denied freedom of movement and other basic rights.\n\nMany people who fled earlier violence and moved into displacement camps inside Myanmar have been unable to leave those settlements for years.\n\nMost Rohingya have lived in poverty in Rakhine, near the Bangladesh border. Marked by their religion and their language \u2014 most speak a dialect of Bengali, while most of their neighbors speak Rakhine \u2014 they are easy to target.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Tofayel Ahmad in Cox\u2019s Bazar and Edith M.

But the campaign has had a hidden cost: civilians cut down by the drones\u2019 missiles.\n\nThere is no comprehensive count of civilian deaths because of the difficulty of confirming identities and allegiances of those killed. But in an examination of drone strikes this year alone, The Associated Press found that at least 30 of the dead likely did not belong to al-Qaida.\n\nThat is around a third of all those killed in drone strikes so far in 2018. The Pentagon does not release its assessment of the death toll, but an independent database considered one of the most credible in tracking violence in Yemen counted 88 people \u2014 militants and non-militants \u2014 killed by drones this year.\n\nThe AP count gives a glimpse, even if incomplete, into how often civilians are mistakenly hit by drone strikes, at a time when the Trump administration has dramatically ramped up the use of armed drones.

Immensely greater destruction has been wreaked by U.S. allies in the Saudi-led coalition\u2019s air campaign against Iranian-backed Shiite rebels known as Houthis. More than 57,000 civilians and combatants have been killed in Yemen\u2019s civil war, by some estimates, and thousands more may have died of starvation caused by the conflict.\n\nYet the killing of a single man \u2014 Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, slain by Saudi operatives in his own country\u2019s consulate \u2014 has raised more international uproar than any of those deaths in a war waged by a coalition led by Saudi Arabia and baked by the U.S.\n\nIn comparison, the toll from U.S drones in Yemen runs in the hundreds, including both militants and civilians. Several databases are trying to track the deaths, with varying results. The Bureau for Investigative Journalism counted up to 1,020 killed by strikes from 2009 to 2016, under President Barack Obama, compared to up to 205 killed in 2017 and 2018. Another database, by the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, counted 331 killed the past two years.\n\nCounting civilians among those numbers is complicated by the difficulty in determining who belongs to al-Qaida in a country of multiple warring militias. Al-Qaida has joined the battle against the Houthis, and many of its fighters are incorporated into militias armed and funded by the U.S.-backed coalition.\n\nThe campaign has scored some military successes. In 2015, U.S. strikes took out Nasser al-Wahishi, the top leader of al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP as the Yemeni branch is known, and several senior lieutenants.\n\nBut drones have been most effective in forcing al-Qaida to limit its movements and hide in the mountains, avoid large gatherings and restrict cellphone use. The group withdrew from areas it controlled in the south but was allowed to keep weapons and money under secret deals it struck with the United Arab Emirates, a coalition member.\n\nOver the years, the cost of the pursuit of senior leadership has been high.\n\nFor example, the U.S. has killed at least 66 civilians, 31 of them children, in the unsuccessful hunt for one man, Qassim al-Rimi, one of AQAP\u2019s founders who in 2015 succeeded al-Wahishi as the group\u2019s chief.\n\nThose deaths came in two raids reportedly targeting al-Rimi. The first was in 2009 in the southern village of al-Majalah. The second came on Jan 27, 2017, only days after Trump\u2019s inauguration, in a U.S. special forces assault on a village in Bayda province.\n\nThe civilian deaths come in a war conducted from a vast distance.\n\nDrone pilots work remotely at American bases, most often in the U.S., sometimes on 11- to 14-hour shifts housed in rooms like shipping containers lined with electronics. They operate based on intelligence from informants but they also carry out so-called \u201csignature strikes,\u201d based on observing suspicious patterns of behavior. They have a list of characteristics, and if a subject on the ground shows a number of them, he could be targeted, a former participant to the drone program told the AP, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the operations.\n\nMistakes happen from bad intel or misjudging behavior, he said. Rights groups have expressed concern that some of the intelligence may come from prisoners held in jails run by Emirati-backed militias where torture is widespread.\n\nSome of the strikes from 2018 that the AP examined appeared to be mistakes.\n\nOn Jan. 1, a drone missile slammed into a farm in Bayda province where 70-year-old Mohammed Mansar Abu Sarima sat with a younger relative, killing both, according to a relative, Mohammed Abu Sarima.\n\nThe slain men had just returned from mediating a local dispute. In a country where tribal links are powerful and the justice system nearly non-existent, such mediations are common to resolve conflicts over land or deaths. They involve large gatherings of tribesmen who are often armed, potentially raising drone operators\u2019 suspicions.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have any affiliation. They are simple farmers who don\u2019t know how to read or write,\u201d said the brother. \u201cWe live in fear. Drones don\u2019t leave the sky.\u201d\n\nSeveral weeks later, a 14-year-old shepherd, Yahia al-Hassbi, was struck by a drone as he tended goats several kilometers (miles) from a checkpoint that al-Qaida had tried recently to seize. He was killed along with a construction worker passing by at the time, according to relatives and three local human rights workers, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.\n\nFurther east, in Hadramawt province, drones carried out several consecutive days of strikes in March, targeting vehicles on a main highway. Some of the strikes killed al-Qaida militants, according to rights activists in the area.\n\nBut others struck down cars carrying people who had fled to the area from a nearby province, Jawf, to escape fighting. A drone\u2019s missile on March 5 killed a 10-year-old boy, Ammer al-Mahshami, and wounded the driver, according to three relatives. Four days later, another car was hit, killing six men and boys, including a 14-year-old and an 18-year-old, travelling to a funeral.\n\nSaleh al-Wahir, the brother of one of the dead, was in a car behind them. \u201cI saw it before my eyes,\u201d he said of the blast. \u201cBodies were ripped apart.\u201d A report from the Jawf Human Rights office concluded the men were civilians.\n\nSurvivors are rare. Adel al-Mandhari recounted how his car was thrown through the air by the blast of a drone\u2019s missile. He lost his legs and an arm and was burned all over his body. The four others in the car \u2014 his brother, uncle, cousin and another relative \u2014 were all killed. None were connected to al-Qaida, said al-Mandhari, a civil servant. Two other relatives and the three rights workers in Bayda confirmed his account.\n\nSince the attack, al-Mandhari has spoken to the media and rights groups, seeking ways to get compensation and an apology from the U.S. \u201cI lost hope,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing is going to happen.\u201d\n\nEven some strikes that the AP did not include in its count may have killed civilians, though there is some dispute over them.\n\nOn May 14, two men, Hussein al-Dayani and Abdullah al-Karbi, were killed when a drone struck their pickup truck in an area of Shabwa province where al-Qaida is known to have a presence.\n\nAl-Dayani\u2019s brother, Khaled, denied they were militants. He said his brother was a fighter in a militia battling the Houthis. \u201cWe are against those people,\u201d Khaled said of al-Qaida.\n\nTwo weeks later, a 17-year-old, Mahdar Hussein al-Hag, died in a strike while driving his motorcycle in the same area. Mahdar\u2019s father said he was a high school student and was returning from buying vegetables. \u201cHe might have been mistaken for al-Qaida youth who are active in this area.\u201d\n\nA Yemeni security official said the dead in those strikes were all al-Qaida members, though he did not provide evidence. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the press.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Israel plans to build a cable car to relieve traffic in Jerusalem\u2019s Old City. The project has united architects and Palestinian activists in opposition to a project they say is an eyesore to a picturesque landscape and a ploy to entrench Israeli control over the city\u2019s contested eastern sector. (Sebastian Scheiner, File/Associated Press)\n\nJERUSALEM \u2014 An Israeli plan to build a cable car to Jerusalem\u2019s historic Old City has united architects and Palestinian activists in opposition to a project they say is both an eyesore and a ploy to entrench Israeli control over the city\u2019s contested eastern sector.\n\nDevelopers say the proposed project is meant to relieve snarling traffic and will ferry some 3,000 tourists an hour from the western sector directly to the Old City, in east Jerusalem. It follows a series of Israeli projects in the combustible city that have enraged the Palestinians.\n\nFurther complicating matters is the project\u2019s association with the Elad Foundation, a group that has settled Jewish nationalists in the heart of Jerusalem\u2019s Arab neighborhoods. The final cable car station will be integrated into a future tourist center run by the organization.\n\n\u201cThe cable car will send oblivious tourists flying over the heads of Palestinians and drop them off in the middle of occupied east Jerusalem, the eye of the storm, the .... center of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,\u201d said Betty Herschman of Ir Amim, an advocacy group that promotes equality in the city. \u201cThis cable car is putting new facts on the ground that undermine any possibility for a peace process.\u201d\n\nIsrael captured east Jerusalem, along with the limestone-walled Old City, in the 1967 Mideast war and later annexed it, a move never recognized internationally. The Palestinians claim the eastern sector as capital of a future state while Israel considers the entire city its eternal, undivided capital. The conflicting claims to east Jerusalem lie at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and have frequently spilled over into violence.\n\nIn recent years, Israel has carried out a series of initiatives, billed as development projects, that have infuriated the Palestinians. Israel built a light rail train through both parts of the city, abutting the Old City and snaking through predominantly Arab neighborhoods. The train is popular with Arabs and Jews, but it has also been the target of Palestinian rioters when tensions rise.\n\nAnother proposed plan involves digging a railway tunnel under Jerusalem\u2019s Old City, passing near sites holy to Jews, Christians and Muslims. The proposed line would end at the Western Wall, with a station named after President Donald Trump, who is cheered in Israel for having recognized Jerusalem as its capital.\n\nBeyond political opposition, the cable car has faced an outcry from urban planners and architects.\n\n\u201cThis project is an outrage, an affront to our historic skyline,\u201d said Moshe Safdie, a renowned architect who signed a petition against the plan along with 70 Israeli figures from architecture, archaeology and academia. \u201cThis will Disneyfy a sacred place. Imagine a huge cable car flying over the Vatican and dumping tourists in front of St. Peter\u2019s. It\u2019s unprecedented.\u201d\n\nNo image says Jerusalem like the postcard view of its Old City \u2014 with its towering ancient walls, the Western Wall and the glimmering gold-topped Dome of the Rock.\n\nThe cable car would run 1,400 meters (nearly one mile), launching from the First Station, a popular food and cultural center in west Jerusalem, sailing over the city\u2019s ancient valley, stopping at Mount Zion, a hill just outside the Old City walls, and proceeding through the Palestinian neighborhood of Silwan before alighting at the tourist center.\n\nAber Zayyad, a Palestinian resident of Silwan and director of its women\u2019s community center, said she fears the cable car flying overhead will infringe on residents\u2019 privacy and that its construction may harm houses and a local cemetery.\n\n\u201cOur tombs will likely be damaged, not to mention our lives,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd of course it will further attempts to make Jerusalem a solely Jewish city.\u201d\n\nThe cable car\u2019s destination at the tourist center has sparked concern about the project\u2019s potential to serve settler interests by promoting Elad\u2019s exclusive Jewish narrative of the city.\n\n\u201cWe believe that this is an attempt to change the character of the city and its face ... its culture and identity,\u201d said Adnan Husseini, the Palestinian minister of Jerusalem Affairs.\n\nIsrael\u2019s Tourism Ministry denies any political motivation. It says the cable car presents an environmentally friendly solution to the crisis of congestion, accessibility and parking at a time of record-breaking tourist visits. The Old City is Israel\u2019s No. 1 tourist destination.\n\nIsrael\u2019s National Infrastructure Committee, which fast-tracks transportation projects of national importance, has given approval to the project. A building permit is to come after a 60-day period of public review \u2014 a step that developers believe will be a formality.\n\nIn May, Israel allocated some $55 million to the project and, barring major complications, cars should be crisscrossing the valley by 2021, the Tourism Ministry said.\n\nAmir Halevi, the ministry\u2019s director general, said he sympathizes with concerns about the sensitivity of the site but claimed that the rapidly rising tourism rates demand a dramatic response.\n\n\u201cThere is always the question of how to balance developing and preserving,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you cannot stop development.\u201d\n\nHalevi added that the Ministry mapped the cable car route carefully to \u201cminimize\u201d the evacuation and demolition of buildings.\n\nHe stressed the cable car would not enter the Old City or go over its walls, but would stop just outside. \u201cWe\u2019re doing this to prevent the need to construct more invasive things,\u201d he said.\n\nUrban planning experts disagree that the cable cars, which hold 10 people per carriage, will resolve the city\u2019s daunting transportation problems.\n\nSalmah Milson Arad, director of the Jerusalem chapter of the Association of Architects and Urban Planners, estimated the cable cars will relieve only around 30 percent of bus traffic.\n\nOther critics have questioned whether the massive undertaking will even appeal to customers.\n\n\u201cIsraelis come to the (Western) Wall in their cars, the ultra-Orthodox walk, Arabs won\u2019t use this, and it\u2019s hard to imagine tourists in massive buses going out of their way to get to First Station,\u201d said Giora Solar, architect and former director of conservation for Israel\u2019s Antiquities Authority. \u201cSo who\u2019s going to benefit?\u201d\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Sign up for the Today\u2019s WorldView newsletter.\n\nAs Today\u2019s WorldView noted last week, talks between the United States and North Korea have hit a rut. Now a new report from a respected Washington think tank that identified hidden North Korean missile bases has sparked fresh debate about Pyongyang\u2019s trustworthiness.\n\nThese bases \u2014 and the activity at them \u2014 seem to show that North Korea continues to prepare for a potential nuclear war despite the historic summit between President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in June. There have also been reports that North Korea is still producing missiles and nuclear material. All of this, along with Pyongyang\u2019s reputation for cheating in prior agreements, has created a minor panic over whether Kim deliberately deceived the United States about his willingness to dismantle his nuclear program.\n\nGiven the high stakes of the negotiations, it\u2019s worth examining the allegations of North Korean deception: What has Kim actually said he would do with his nuclear weapons program? And why are claims of North Korean deception so worrying?\n\nOn the first question, the answer is a lot.\n\n\n\nPresident Trump reaches to shake hands with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore on June 12. (Evan Vucci/AP)\n\nKim kicked off 2018 with a New Year\u2019s Day speech, one that offered the first hint that Kim was open to negotiations after a year of weapons testing and increasingly hostile rhetoric from both Pyongyang and Washington. But there was another part of the speech that seems just as important in hindsight. Kim hailed the supposed completion of its nuclear weapons development and said it was time for a new goal.\n\n\u201cThis year, we should focus on mass-producing nuclear warheads and ballistic missiles for operational deployment,\u201d Kim said. \u201cThese weapons will be used only if our security is threatened.\u201d\n\n\u201cKim himself proclaimed that they no longer need to test parts anymore and will just mass-produce weapons,\u201d Duyeon Kim, an adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, said to Today\u2019s WorldView. North Korea has never publicly repudiated these comments, and the United States has never clearly stated that Kim rejected them when he met with Trump in Singapore.\n\nOn Monday, in response to the Center for Strategic and International Studies report, Today\u2019s WorldView spoke to a number of experts to ask whether the continued work at North Korean missile sites, as well as other reports that North Korean is expanding its missile arsenal, would violate the agreement reached between Kim and Trump in Singapore.\n\nAll of them agreed \u2014 often quite emphatically \u2014 that it did not. \u201cKim hasn\u2019t broken any promises,\u201d said Jeffrey Lewis, a nonproliferation expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey. \u201cInstead, he\u2019s making good on one of them \u2014 to mass-produce nuclear weapons.\u201d\n\nAs such, it\u2019s not surprising that North Korea would still be manning secret missile bases, or even producing new missiles or nuclear weapons. \u201cEven though they\u2019re violating all U.N. Security Council resolutions, North Korea didn\u2019t break any promises with Trump because there\u2019s no nuclear deal in place yet with Washington \u2014 there\u2019s nothing that prevents them from expanding their nuclear arsenal,\u201d Duyeon Kim said.\n\n\u201cLike any other nuclear weapon-possessing state, North Korea is refining the facilities and procedures associated with operating nuclear forces,\u201d Ankit Panda observed in an analysis for NK News this week.\n\nSo if North Korea is doing what it said it would be doing, why are allegations of North Korean deception so worrying? Because they reveal how differently the United States and North Korea perceive what happened in Singapore, a gap that could sink any diplomatic progress.\n\nTrump himself has consistently portrayed North Korean denuclearization as a fait accompli. But North Korea, many analysts say, sees getting rid of its nuclear weapons as the last in a long series of peace-building measures that need to be taken \u2014 if it even happens at all.\n\nToday, the NYT published a piece detailing North Korea\u2019s continued nuclear advances and the IAEA declared that Iran is complying with JCPOA limits. Yet the Trump administration acts as though NK is disarming and Iran is racing to the bomb. This is the exact opposite of reality. \u2014 Nicholas Miller (@Nick_L_Miller) November 12, 2018\n\n\u201cTrump seems not to understand that he did not negotiate a \u2018deal\u2019 in Singapore,\u201d Frank Jannuzi, the president of the Mansfield Foundation and an Asia expert, wrote on Twitter. \u201cHe negotiated only an \u2018intent to negotiate.\u2019 The hard work has yet to commence.\u201d\n\nIt has not. After the bonhomie between Trump and Kim faded, working-level meetings between the United States and North Korea foundered. North Korea has pushed for concessions such as a formal end to the Korean War and sanctions relief, and it has even threatened to restart testing.\n\nAccusations of dishonesty and a subsequent air of distrust have derailed many previous attempts to find common ground between Washington and Pyongyang. Certainly, North Korea\u2019s reputation for obtuseness and disregard for the truth is well-earned. But so far, North Korea has kept to the vague requirements agreed to in Singapore.\n\nAnd if there\u2019s someone confused about what that summit meant, it doesn\u2019t appear to be Kim.\n\nWant smart analysis of the most important news in your inbox every weekday along with other global reads, interesting ideas and opinions to know?

Hicks, a former top Pentagon official during the Obama administration and one of the commissioners. \u201cIt\u2019s the flashing red that we are trying to relay.\u201d\n\nThe picture of the national security landscape that the 12-person commission sketched is a bleak one, in which an American military that has enjoyed undisputed dominance for decades is failing to receive the resources, innovation and prioritization its leaders need to outmuscle China and Russia in a race for military might reminiscent of the Cold War.\n\nThe military balance has shifted adversely for the United States in Europe, Asia and the Middle East, undermining the confidence of American allies and increasing the likelihood of military conflict, the commission found after reviewing classified documents, receiving Pentagon briefings and interviewing top defense officials.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. military could suffer unacceptably high casualties and loss of major capital assets in its next conflict. It might struggle to win, or perhaps lose, a war against China or Russia,\u201d the report said. \u201cThe United States is particularly at risk of being overwhelmed should its military be forced to fight on two or more fronts simultaneously.\u201d\n\nIn its list of 32 recommendations, the commission urged the Pentagon to explain more clearly how it intends to defeat major-power rivals in competition and war. It assailed the strategy for relying at times on \u201cquestionable assumptions and weak analysis\u201d and leaving \u201cunanswered critical questions.\u201d\n\nEric Edelman, a top Pentagon official during the Bush administration, who co-chaired the commission along with retired Admiral Gary Roughead, said the report wrestled with the consequences of years of ignored warnings about the erosion of American military might.\n\nRussia and China have \u201clearned from what we\u2019ve done. They\u2019ve learned from our success. And while we\u2019ve been off doing a different kind of warfare, they\u2019ve been prepared for a kind of warfare at the high end that we really haven\u2019t engaged in for a very long time,\u201d Edelman told Michael Morell, the former acting director of the CIA and a fellow member of the commission, during an episode of Morell\u2019s podcast, \u201cIntelligence Matters.\u201d\n\nEdelman said people had lost sight of how complicated the international security environment had become for the United States, and argued that for a lot of reasons the American public and Congress haven\u2019t been as attentive to the urgency of the situation as they should be.\n\nThe commission said that despite a $716 billion American defense budget this year, which is four times the size of China\u2019s and more than 10 times that of Russia, the effort to reshape the U.S. defense establishment to counter current threats is under-resourced. It recommended that Congress lift budget caps on defense spending in the next two years that in the past have hobbled the military\u2019s ability to plan for the long term.\n\n\u201cIt is beyond the scope of our work to identify the exact dollar amount required to fully fund the military\u2019s needs,\u201d the report concluded. \u201cYet available resources are clearly insufficient to fulfill the strategy\u2019s ambitious goals, including that of ensuring that (the Defense Department) can defeat a major-power adversary while deterring other enemies simultaneously.\u201d\n\nThe call for even more robust defense spending comes as the Democrats take over the House and seek rollbacks of key Pentagon programs. It also comes after the White House instructed the Pentagon to pare back its planned budget for the coming year by about 4.5 percent, or approximately $33 billion, after the federal deficit increased sharply following last year\u2019s tax cut.\n\nWhite House national security adviser John Bolton recently said he expected the defense budget to remain relatively flat in the coming years as the administration seeks to cut discretionary spending, and suggested the Pentagon would need to reshape the military with funds derived from cuts to other areas. It promises to be a dramatic shift after two years of increased defense spending and repeated statements by President Trump that he is rebuilding the American military like never before.\n\nMoney saved from planned Pentagon changes will prove insufficient to make the kind of investment the military needs to execute the new national defense strategy, the commission found. It also said Congress should look at the entire federal budget, including entitlement spending and tax revenue, to put the nation on more stable financial footing, rather than slash defense spending.\n\nCritics of the report\u2019s findings said the commission recommends catchall defense funding that is unrealistic given the current environment. One of the commission\u2019s members, retired Army officer Andrew Krepinevich, wrote a dissent to the findings arguing that the commission failed to apply analytic rigor to its own recommendations even as it accused the Pentagon strategy of lacking analytic rigor.\n\n\u201cThe commission rightly calls attention to the erosion of the American military\u2019s conventional edge and the necessity for the country to understand the urgency of the problem,\u201d said Elbridge Colby, a former Pentagon official under Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and who oversaw the strategy\u2019s development. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t give due support and credit to the hard choices that Secretary Mattis made, which are crucial to solving this problem.\u201d\n\nTo counter Russia and China, the commission said the Navy should expand its submarine fleet and sealift forces; the Air Force should introduce more reconnaissance platforms and stealth long-range fighters and bombers; and the Army should pursue more armor, long-range precision missiles and air-defense and logistical forces.\n\nIn its recommendations, the report advocated seeing through the modernization of the U.S. nuclear arsenal and putting a top Pentagon official in charge of developing additional air and missile defenses.\n\nAnother area of focus for the commission was innovation.\n\nIt described Pentagon acquisition programs as too risk-averse, and urged the Defense Department and Congress to create a new category of pilot programs aimed at \u201cleap-ahead\u201d technologies that could serve as breakthroughs to help retain American military dominance.\n\nThe report also resurfaced questions about the civilian-military divide that arose after Mattis, a retired Marine Corps general, took over as defense secretary, thanks to a vote in Congress that waived a requirement for military officers to be out of uniform for 10 years before serving in that role.\n\nIn his nearly two years as secretary, Mattis has relied more on current and former military officers for expertise than his recent predecessors have.\n\nWithout singling out Mattis, the commission warned that \u201cresponsibility on key strategic and policy issues has increasingly migrated to the military,\u201d and urged Congress to exercise oversight to \u201creverse the unhealthy trend in which decision-making is drifting increasingly toward the military on issues of national importance.\u201d", "Advice columnist\n\nDear Carolyn: Four months ago I moved into a new place, and have fallen for one of my roommates. I want to ask her out, but given our year-long lease I don't know if this is a good idea. We hang out and really get along, and I do not want to jeopardize our friendship.\n\nI was telling her about a road trip I am taking in about seven months for a wedding, and she wants to come with. It would be us two on a 12-hour road trip to the wedding. We would then take five days to go hiking about in the mountains because we both love to do that, and then head back home. This does not seem like something you would do with \"just a friend,\" but again we really get along and maybe she is just doing this because she likes to hike and hang out with me.\n\nIt's hard for me to keep on going like this. Do I wait until the end of the lease to ask her? What if she loses interest in me because I waited too long to ask her out?

They divorced, and Sally had a daughter, Zelda, with another man seven years later. Because Zelda is our grandson's half sister, is she any relation to us? We are close with Sally and always treated Zelda as a granddaughter, though not blood-related. Just wondering.\n\n\u2014 J.\n\nJ.: Zelda is of no relation to you.\n\nWhich makes your embrace of Zelda all the more lovely a gesture. Not that you meant it to be so, and not that you were even asking me about this (ahem), but your choice to be inclusive sets such an important example for these kids.\n\nIt\u2019s not always possible to do this, of course. Sallys aren\u2019t always open to an ex-parent-in-law\u2019s presence in their new families, so yay for her, and even just numbers can get in the way. You have one grandson and one Zelda, but imagine if you had multiple grandkids and recoupling had introduced multiple Zeldas. Not everyone can manage that.\n\nSo think role vs. relation: Do the best you can.\n\nEmphasis \u201ccan,\u201d emphasis \u201cbest.\u201d", "\n\nBailey Richardson, one of the 13 original Instagram employees, has deleted the app. (Yana Paskova/For The Washington Post)\n\nOn the evening of Sept. 26, Bailey Richardson logged in to Instagram for the last time.\n\n\u201cThe time has come for me to delete my Instagram,\u201d she wrote to her 20,000 followers, using her white pants as a canvas. \u201cThanks for all the kindnesses over the years.\u201d\n\nRichardson\u2019s decision isn\u2019t novel: 68 percent of Americans have either quit or taken a break from social media this year, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nBut Richardson isn\u2019t a bystander reckoning with the ills of technology: She was one of the 13 original employees working at Instagram in 2012 when Facebook bought the viral photo-sharing app for $1 billion. She and four others from that small group now say the sense of intimacy, artistry and discovery that defined early Instagram and led to its success has given way to a celebrity-driven marketplace that is engineered to sap users\u2019 time and attention at the cost of their well-being.\n\n\u201cIn the early days, you felt your post was seen by people who cared about you and that you cared about,\u201d said Richardson, who left Instagram in 2014 and later founded a start-up. \u201cThat feeling is completely gone for me now.\u201d\n\n[From Silicon Valley elite to social media hate: The radicalization that led to Gab]\n\nThe catalyst for Richardson\u2019s decision to quit Instagram came when its co-founders, Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, unexpectedly announced that they were leaving the company. With their exit, Richardson and other former Instagram employees worried Facebook would squash whatever independent identity the company had managed to retain.\n\nShe sent her goodbye to Instagram the next day.\n\nEven in Silicon Valley, where it\u2019s common to hear start-up workers become frustrated with management after an acquisition, the disillusionment of the early Instagram employees is striking: People seldom swear off or criticize the product they built, particularly when it has enjoyed such remarkable success. Instagram reached 1 billion users this year.\n\nThe people who worked at social networks long saw the connection and free expression they facilitated as a powerful force for good and evidence of the contribution they were making to society. For them, the public questioning of the role social networks play in democracy and in individual lives, sparked by concerns over privacy and health, is deeply personal.\n\nThree of the early Instagram employees, including Richardson, have deleted it \u2014 permanently or periodically, comparing it to a drug that produces a diminishing high. One of the people said he felt a little embarrassed to tell people that he worked there. Two of the other early employees said they used it far less than before.\n\nThis shift is part of an existential crisis for Facebook, which has seen a slew of top executives resign this year, including the leaders of its major acquisitions: Oculus, WhatsApp and Instagram. Some people are also abandoning Facebook: It lost 4 million users in Europe in the last six months and growth has plateaued in the United States.\n\nThe Instagram employees, including Richardson, said they hoped their concerns would not be dismissed as nostalgia and would be seen as a call to future entrepreneurs to recognize these pitfalls and build something better.\n\n\u201cThere was so much pressure to do things that \u2018scaled,\u2019 to use the Silicon Valley buzzword,\u201d said Josh Riedel, the third employee after Systrom and Krieger. \u201cBut when you have over a billion users, something gets lost along the way.\u201d\n\nIan Spalter, Instagram\u2019s head of design, said in an interview that experiences on Instagram are subjective \u2014 one person\u2019s frustration may be another person\u2019s pleasure \u2014 and that the app was not designed to be a time-suck. \u201cWe\u2019re not in the game to have you leave Instagram feeling worse off than when you went in,\u201d he said.\n\nOne of the departed founders of a company Facebook acquired, WhatsApp\u2019s Brian Acton, has actively encouraged people to delete Facebook, though he is still a proponent and a user of WhatsApp. (He is also funding a rival messaging app.) Other former Facebook executives have expressed regrets about the products they built. Instagram\u2019s Systrom continues to champion the service but recently said of his departure: \u201cYou don\u2019t leave a job because everything is awesome, right?\u201d\n\nII.\n\nWhen Richardson joined Instagram in February 2012, at age 26, the former art history major was drawn to what was then a fast-growing indie platform for photographers, hipsters and artistic-types who wanted to share interesting or beautiful things they discovered about the world. At that time, Instagram was \u201ca camera that looked out into the world,\" said one of the company\u2019s first engineers, \"versus a camera that was all about myself, my friends, who I\u2019m with.\u201d\n\nRichardson ran the start-up\u2019s blog as well as the official @instagram account from the company\u2019s offices in San Francisco\u2019s South Park neighborhood. Before there were software algorithms suggesting accounts to follow, Richardson selected featured Instagrammers by hand. For the most devoted users, she organized in-person \u201cInsta-meets\u201d in places as far-flung as Moscow and North Korea.\n\n\u201cWe felt like stewards of that passion,\u201d Richardson said.\n\n\n\nRichardson moved to New York after leaving Instagram. (Yana Paskova/For The Washington Post)\n\nOne of the first people she featured prominently was an early Instagrammer in Spain. The exposure Richardson gave @IsabelitaVirtual, an amateur photographer whose real name is Isabel Martinez, helped Martinez become one of the most popular Instagram users in the country and led to a career in high-end fashion photography.\n\nBoth say that type of random connection that resulted in their friendship is hardly possible in the current iteration of Instagram. Too many people to follow, too much showmanship, too many posts flickering by, they say. \u201cI don\u2019t even see her posts anymore,\u201d Richardson said. Martinez told The Post that while she wouldn\u2019t quit Instagram for professional reasons, the app has in recent years become more anxiety-producing than pleasurable for her.\n\n[Facebook\u2019s former security chief warns of tech\u2019s \u2018negative impacts\u2019 \u2014 and has a plan to help solve them]\n\nEven in the early days, Richardson was aware that the app had a dark side. She was one of the first content moderators and spent many days and weekends culling through pornographic and other undesirable images that sprung up as the app grew.\n\nIII.\n\nA few months after Richardson started her job at Instagram, Systrom announced to the dozen employees that the company had been acquired by Facebook \u2014 taking everyone by surprise. The entire team got in a bus and drove about 30 miles south to Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park, where Facebook employees broke into applause as they entered the building. CEO Mark Zuckerberg took them into his office, where he welcomed them excitedly and assured them that they would maintain their own unique identity.\n\nRichardson said she was excited but apprehensive. The details of the acquisition were still murky. Ultimately only Systrom and Krieger walked away with hundreds of millions of dollars; Facebook offered other early employees small signing bonuses and limited Facebook stock grants for staying on. And Facebook had a reputation for alienating users with its privacy scandals, including charges it had settled with the Federal Trade Commission the previous year for sharing people\u2019s personal details that they thought were private with app developers and the public.\n\nA few months later, the team was officially installed in Menlo Park, where Instagram was given a separate area on campus to work.\n\nIts employees were seen as the cool kids on campus. They had figured out how to make a smartphone-only product go viral, something Facebook was still struggling to accomplish ahead of its impending public offering.\n\nBut there were things Facebook wanted to improve about Instagram. Facebook\u2019s growth team \u2014 an influential unit whose goal was to identify and implement measures to acquire users and keep them engaged \u2014 came in and picked apart every feature of the app, three of the former employees said.\n\nNo detail was too small. The team helped fix Instagram\u2019s clunky sign-in process, which was leaking users. It borrowed techniques that had worked on Facebook, like sending users an email alert about their friends\u2019 activities when they hadn\u2019t used the app in a while. They rolled out photo-tagging, much to the frustration of Instagram employees, who felt these features were too associated with Facebook and would fall flat with Instagram\u2019s user base, said four of the employees.\n\nThe photo-tagging feature triggered \u201cemotional anxiety,\u201d said the early engineer. \u201cIt introduced a whole new dynamic.\u201d\n\nRichardson\u2019s team of about six employees, which was focused on managing Instagram\u2019s most passionate power users, was also targeted for change. Facebook told them that in order for the product to scale to a large audience, software tools would need to replace manual processes, Richardson and two former employees said.\n\nRichardson said she was taken aback, \u201cnot because of the boldness of it or because of how crappy it made me and my contribution feel, but because of the misunderstanding of what we were trying to do.\u201d\n\nShe began making plans to leave and resigned in 2014, along with most of the employees The Post spoke with. By then, the app had more than 200 million users, compared with roughly 30 million at the time of the acquisition. Three of the original 13 employees are still at Instagram or Facebook, according to Facebook.\n\nInstagram moved to an algorithmic feed in 2016 \u2014 prior to that posts were in chronological order \u2014 and software is now doing much of the discovery on behalf of users, feeding them tailored content. The Stories feature, added the same year, introduced a flickering element to Instagram\u2019s design by automatically reloading new stories in a carousel. The result of these changes and others prior to it was increased follower counts, produced larger social networks with weaker ties, and more time spent in the app.\n\nRichardson, who is a big fan of hedgehogs, found herself looking at many more of them on Instagram. \u201cI clicked on one, but then I get dozens, which is more than my brain can possibly manage,\u201d she said. \u201cIt takes all the agency out of it.\u201d\n\n[A content moderator says she got PTSD while reviewing images posted on Facebook]\n\nSpalter, the Instagram design chief, pointed out that Instagram\u2019s rapid growth has required the company to build tools that will assist people in finding posts and users. \u201cWe have a billion people,\u201d he said. \u201cThat means we have content from every weird niche interest, and we have made it easier for you to find things. That\u2019s also the beauty of having a much larger community.\u201d\n\nInstagram is aware that its software was offering up too much celebrity content and content from people with large followings at the expense of posts from people who users know personally, according to Spalter, who joined Instagram in 2015. The company has rejiggered the software to adjust the balance, he said.\n\n\u201cManaging that balance is critical to Instagram\u2019s future. ... If you feed gets overrun with celebrities, you won\u2019t feel comfortable sharing content with your friends anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cI get how, in the early days, when you\u2019re connecting with everyone, that\u2019s very special. We\u2019re at a different phase of development at this point, and it\u2019s a different world in that way. But it\u2019s still a place where people connect.\u201d\n\nHe added that Instagram released tools in August to help people manage the time they spend on the app.\n\nRichardson says that content on Instagram is now \u201ctoo eager for your attention.\u201d Before, \u201cyou had to make an effort to find someone, and that meant something to you and to the people you found. Today I\u2019m amazed by how little honor each piece of content is given.\u201d\n\nAfter leaving Instagram, Richardson traveled around the world, meeting Instagram users whom she had connected with online. She eventually settled in New York City, where she founded a start-up called People & Company, where she helps nonprofits and businesses, including Nike, find ways to connect with their audiences online.\n\nShe says she wasn\u2019t thinking actively about Instagram until late September, when news broke that its founders were resigning \u2014 once again taking most of their employees by surprise.\n\nRichardson was flooded with memories. She remembered first meeting Martinez, and all that had changed since. She called up a friend from her Instagram days, and they concluded that Instagram no longer had value in their lives. Together, they decided to quit. She composed her last post while sitting in her car.\n\n\u201cIt feels like we\u2019re all addicted to a drug that doesn\u2019t get us high anymore,\u201d she said of the decision. \u201cSo I wanted to make space for something that really does.\u201d", "FILE- In this Sept. 24, 2018, file photo, members of the Korean K-Pop group BTS attend a meeting at the United Nations high level event regarding youth during the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly at U.N. headquarters. The agency for the South Korean band BTS on Wednesday, Nov. 14, 2018, has apologized for a member wearing a T-shirt depicting the explosion of an atomic bomb. (Craig Ruttle, File/Associated Press)\n\nSEOUL, South Korea \u2014 The agency for K-pop superstars BTS apologized Wednesday for members wearing a T-shirt depicting the explosion of an atomic bomb and a hat with a Nazi emblem.\n\nJapanese TV broadcasters recently canceled or stopped discussing possible appearances by the band in that country after images spread on social media of a singer wearing the shirt. The South Korean boy band ran into more troubles after news broke that another member wore a hat featuring a Nazi symbol in a magazine photo book and band members flew flags with what appeared to be Nazi swastikas during a concert in the past.\n\n\u201cWe would like to again offer our sincerest apologies to anyone who has suffered pain, distress and discomfort due to our shortcomings,\u201d the band\u2019s agency, Big Hit Entertainment, said in a statement.\n\nThe T-shirt portrayed an atomic bombing juxtaposed with the celebration of Korea\u2019s 1945 liberation from Japan at the end of the World War II. The United States dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki before Tokyo\u2019s surrender.\n\nBefore its division into North and South Korea after the liberation, the Korean Peninsula was colonized by Japan in 1910-1945. Many in both Koreas still harbor strong resentment of the Japanese colonial masters. But in South Korea, it\u2019s extremely rare for anyone to publicly celebrate the atomic bombings.\n\nThe bombings killed more than 200,000 people in Japan. Many Koreans were living in Japan at the time, including laborers who were forcibly mobilized by the Japanese, and estimates of the number of Koreans killed in the bombings range from 20,000 to 50,000.\n\nSouth Korean politicians criticized the Japanese broadcasters\u2019 decision to cancel BTS appearances, accusing Japan of harboring \u201cself-centered views on history\u201d and letting politics interfere with cultural exchanges.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t appear the T-shirt controversy is seriously affecting the band\u2019s huge popularity in Japan, with 50,000 people reportedly filling up the Tokyo Dome on Wednesday evening to watch them perform.\n\nThe BTS agency said the A-bomb shirt\u2019s wearing was \u201cin no way intentional\u201d and wasn\u2019t designed to \u201cinjure or make light of those affected by the use of atomic weapons.\u201d However, it said it still apologizes for \u201cfailing to take the precautions that could have prevented the wearing of such clothing by our artist.\u201d\n\nIn regard to the hat, it said all apparel and accessories used for the photo book were provided by a media company involved in its publication. It said the flags were intended to symbolize South Korea\u2019s restrictively uniform and authoritarian educational systems, not Nazism.\n\n\u201cWe will carefully examine and review not only these issues but all activities involving Big Hit and our artists based on a firm understanding of diverse social, historical and cultural considerations to ensure that we never cause any injury, pain or distress to anyone,\u201d the agency said.\n\nThe seven members of the band, which has a worldwide following, in May became the first South Korean artists to top the Billboard 200 albums chart with \u201cLove Yourself: Tear.\u201d The band began a Japan tour earlier this week.\n\nSouth Korean K-pop and movie stars are extremely popular in Japan and other Asian countries.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/David Goldman)\n\nScientists behind a major study that claimed the Earth\u2019s oceans are warming faster than previously thought now say their work contained inadvertent errors that made their conclusions seem more certain than they actually are.\n\nTwo weeks after the high-profile study was published in the journal Nature, its authors have submitted corrections to the publication. The Scripps Institution of Oceanography, home to several of the researchers involved, also noted the problems in the scientists' work and corrected a news release on its website, which previously had asserted that the study detailed how the Earth\u2019s oceans \u201chave absorbed 60 percent more heat than previously thought.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, we made mistakes here,\u201d said Ralph Keeling, a climate scientist at Scripps, who was a co-author of the study. \u201cI think the main lesson is that you work as fast as you can to fix mistakes when you find them.\u201d\n\nThe central problem, according to Keeling, came in how the researchers dealt with the uncertainty in their measurements. As a result, the findings suffer from too much doubt to definitively support the paper\u2019s conclusion about how much heat the oceans have absorbed over time.\n\nThe central conclusion of the study \u2014 that oceans are retaining ever more energy as more heat is being trapped within Earth\u2019s climate system each year \u2014 is in line with other studies that have drawn similar conclusions. And it hasn\u2019t changed much despite the errors. But Keeling said the authors' miscalculations mean there is a much larger margin of error in the findings, which means researchers can weigh in with less certainty than they thought.\n\n\u201cI accept responsibility for what happened because it\u2019s my role to make sure that those kind of details got conveyed,\u201d Keeling said. (He has published a more detailed explanation of what happened here.)\n\nThe study\u2019s lead author was Laure Resplandy of Princeton University. Other researchers were with institutions in China, Paris, Germany and the U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research and Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory.\n\n\u201cMaintaining the accuracy of the scientific record is of primary importance to us as publishers and we recognize our responsibility to correct errors in papers that we have published,\u201d Nature said in a statement to The Washington Post. \u201cIssues relating to this paper have been brought to Nature\u2019s attention and we are looking into them carefully. We take all concerns related to papers we have published very seriously and will issue an update once further information is available.\u201d\n\nThe original study, which appeared Oct. 31, derived a new method for measuring how much heat is being absorbed by the oceans. Essentially, the authors measured the volume of gases, specifically oxygen and carbon dioxide, that have escaped the ocean in recent decades and headed into the atmosphere as it heats up. They found that the warming \u201cis at the high end of previous estimates\u201d and suggested that as a result, the rate of global warming itself could be more accelerated.\n\nThe results, wrote the authors, may suggest there is less time than previously thought to curb greenhouse gas emissions. The study drew considerable media attention, including from The Post.\n\nHowever, not long after publication, an independent Britain-based researcher named Nicholas Lewis published a lengthy blog post saying he had found a \u201cmajor problem\u201d with the research.\n\n\u201cSo far as I can see, their method vastly underestimates the uncertainty,\u201d Lewis said in an interview Tuesday, \u201cas well as biasing up significantly, nearly 30 percent, the central estimate.\u201d\n\nLewis added that he tends \u201cto read a large number of papers, and, having a mathematics as well as a physics background, I tend to look at them quite carefully, and see if they make sense. And where they don\u2019t make sense \u2014 with this one, it\u2019s fairly obvious it didn\u2019t make sense \u2014 I look into them more deeply.\u201d\n\nLewis has argued in past studies and commentaries that climate scientists are predicting too much warming because of their reliance on computer simulations, and that current data from the planet itself suggests global warming will be less severe than feared.\n\nIt isn\u2019t clear whether the authors agree with all of Lewis\u2019s criticisms, but Keeling said \u201cwe agree there were problems along the lines he identified.\u201d\n\nPaul Durack, a research scientist at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, said that promptly acknowledging the errors in the study \u201cis the right approach in the interests of transparency.\u201d\n\nBut he added in an email, \u201cThis study, although there are additional questions that are arising now, confirms the long known result that the oceans have been warming over the observed record, and the rate of warming has been increasing,\u201d he said.\n\nGavin Schmidt, head of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, followed the growing debate over the study closely on Twitter and said that measurements about the uptake of heat in the oceans have been bedeviled with data problems for some time \u2014 and that debuting new research in this area is hard.\n\n\u201cObviously you rely on your co-authors and the reviewers to catch most problems, but things still sometimes slip through,\u201d Schmidt wrote in an email.\n\nSchmidt and Keeling agreed that other studies also support a higher level of ocean heat content than the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC, saw in a landmark 2013 report.\n\nOverall, Schmidt said, the episode can be seen as a positive one.\n\n\u201cThe key is not whether mistakes are made, but how they are dealt with \u2014 and the response from Laure and Ralph here is exemplary. No panic, but a careful reexamination of their working \u2014 despite a somewhat hostile environment,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cSo, plus one for some post-publication review, and plus one to the authors for reexamining the whole calculation in a constructive way.

After three decades of promoting free trade as a panacea to poverty, the APEC grouping of nations that includes the U.S. and China is holding its lavish annual leaders meeting in the country that can least afford it. (Mark Schiefelbein/Associated Press)\n\nPORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea \u2014 After three decades of promoting free trade as a panacea to poverty, the APEC grouping of nations that includes the U.S. and China is holding its lavish annual leaders meeting in the country that can least afford it.\n\nBarely penetrated by roads and scarred by violence, Papua New Guinea hopes the parade of world leaders will lift the mountainous Pacific nation of hundreds of tribal groups out of obscurity and attract investment.\n\nBut the expense has brought criticism when the government has a budget crisis, basic medicines are scarce, and polio, eliminated from all but a handful of countries, has returned. In 2015, the International Monetary Fund estimated that upgrading the capital for the event and hosting a year of related meetings could cost $1 billion.\n\nAustralia, the biggest foreign aid donor to Papua New Guinea and former colonial occupier, as well as China and other countries have absorbed some of the cost but critics have already been given plenty of vindication.\n\nIn an eye-popping move, the government imported 40 luxury Maserati cars to whisk VIPs among convention venues in the secure bubble of the APEC meetings. Officials said the government would sell them to recover the cost, sparking more disbelief and suspicions of a corrupt scheme.\n\nChinese government money, meanwhile, has built what has been dubbed a boulevard to nowhere in the capital Port Moresby, a city described by the World Bank as among the world\u2019s most violent due to high unemployment and brazen criminal gangs known as \u201craskols.\u201d\n\nA VIP terminal costing about $19 million was added to the city\u2019s airport. Construction of an iconic building \u201cAPEC Haus\u201d for the leaders\u2019 summit was paid for by oil and gas company Oil Search, which operates all of Papua New Guinea\u2019s oil fields, in exchange for tax credits. That avoided an immediate cost for the government but will erode its revenue in the future.\n\n\u201cI think the money should have been used to fix our backyard instead of decorating the front porch. We have health, education and infrastructure deficiencies that need to be addressed,\u201d said activist and writer Martyn Namorong.\n\n\u201cMany teachers haven\u2019t been paid and hospitals lack medicines,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is so much misery experienced by ordinary Papua New Guineans while the elite party with the world like there is no tomorrow.\u201d\n\nWhat the weeklong talkfest will produce, other than its signature photo of world leaders in locally themed shirts, is unclear. In the impenetrable language of APEC, the meeting is about \u201cHarnessing Inclusive Opportunities, Embracing the Digital Future.\u201d\n\nAllan Bollard, executive director of the APEC secretariat, said the meeting is complicated by the tensions between China and the U.S. over trade and the broader backlash against globalization \u2014 the dominant Western-led ideology over the past four decades that freer trade and movement of people is inevitably good for all.\n\n\u201cThis year we\u2019ve had more bilateral trade friction, between the U.S. and China in particular, and that does make it more complex around the table in the sense that APEC only does initiatives where everybody agrees,\u201d Bollard said.\n\nPort Moresby, a city where foreigners and the local elite live in homes barricaded behind high walls and barbed wire, will host more than 12,000 visitors for the meetings that end on Sunday.\n\nBecause of a shortage of hotels, many will stay in three cruise ships docked at Port Moresby and be shuttled back and forth in some of the hundreds of vehicles imported for the event. The city will be crawling with police and military, some of them from Australia and New Zealand, who are providing air force planes, navy patrol boats, special forces and other personnel.\n\nAustralian media reports say Canberra is spending more than $100 million on security and other support for APEC. The Australian prime minister\u2019s office declined to release a figure, calling the assistance an \u201cextension of long-term cooperation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe security is going to be so tight,\u201d said Jonathan Pryke, a Papua New Guinea expert at the Lowy Institute, an Australian think tank. \u201cThis is going to be the safest time to be in Port Moresby.\u201d\n\nEven so, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and his entourage will be flying into the country each day from northern Queensland in Australia.\n\nOutside of the spruced-up capital, 2018 has been a year of renewed tribal and political violence.\n\nEarlier this month, rioting engulfed the coastal town of Alotau more than 300 kilometers (186 miles) from Port Moresby after police leaving for APEC killed a woman and her child in a road accident, said the town\u2019s Catholic Bishop Rolando Santos. Gunfights erupted when police reinforcements arrived from the capital, he said. The growth of a Chinese diaspora, said Pryke, has also fueled economic tensions that have led to protests and riots.\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t much funds for education, health,\u201d said Santos, a Filipino who\u2019s lived in Papua New Guinea for 17 years. \u201cMany were affected because of APEC.\u201d\n\nThe country\u2019s Catholic Bishops Conference has criticized dire shortages of basic services while the government poured resources into getting the capital ready for world leaders.\n\n\u201cWe share the concern of many about the huge amount of our limited resources being expended on this event which seems designed to entertain and impress the rich and powerful,\u201d said its president Rochus Tatamai.\n\nPapua New Guineans, he said, are \u201csuffering and dying in order to make APEC a success.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

It also cited the CIA\u2019s use of LSD and other drugs during its notorious MK-ULTRA project in the 1950s and \u201960s, when the agency conducted 149 experiments in mind control, including the use of 25 unwitting subjects.\n\nA drug called Versed, known by its generic name, midazolam, was identified by the report as the preferred drug for truth inducement. A benzodiazepine, a class of drugs normally used to treat anxiety, the drug did have a drawback for interrogation purposes, the report noted: It had to be administered by a physician intravenously, compared to LSD, which could be administered without a subject\u2019s knowledge.\n\n\u201cAmbivalently, Versed was considered possibly worth a trial if unequivocal legal sanction first were obtained,\u201d the report noted.\n\nBut the report noted that any use of such a drug would probably bump up against legal obstacles: those that banned conducting medical experiments on prisoners, as well the use of mind-altering drugs in interrogations. The CIA never asked the Justice Department to look at the issue, effectively shelving it.\n\n[Newly released CIA files expose grim details of agency interrogation program]\n\nOrdered released by a judge as part of Freedom of Information Act lawsuits filed by the American Civil Liberties Union, the report sheds more light on a contentious aspect of President George W. Bush\u2019s legacy: the CIA\u2019s use of brutal interrogation techniques after 9/11. It details the tactics used against suspects, including slapping, being thrown against a wall, waterboarding and being confined in a cramped box.\n\nAnd it shows the complicated legal and moral arguments employed by agency officials, including those in the medical world, to justify such ethically challenging decisions.\n\nThough the harsh interrogation methods have been widely condemned since, including by President Barack Obama, and outlined in a public Senate report that noted that the techniques were \u201cin violation of U.S. law, treaty obligations, and our values,\u201d no CIA officers were ever prosecuted for their roles.\n\n\u201cPerhaps the most striking element of the document is the CIA doctors\u2019 willful blindness to the truth of what they were doing,\u201d ACLU staff attorney Dror Ladin wrote about the report. \u201cCIA doctors decided that waterboarding actually \u2018provided periodic relief\u2019 to a prisoner because it was a break from days of standing sleep deprivation. Similarly, CIA doctors decided that when a different prisoner was stuffed into a coffin-sized box, this provided a \u2018relatively benign sanctuary\u2019 from other torture methods.\u201d\n\nThe involvement of doctors and psychologists in the CIA\u2019s interrogation programs has drawn wide outcry from the medical community.\n\nThe CIA declined to comment but pointed to statements made by one of its legal officers in a court case that said the report was a working draft that had never been finalized.\n\nThe report was titled \u201cSummary and Reflections of Chief of Medical Services,\u201d on participation in the CIA\u2019s extraordinary rendition program.\n\nThe ACLU had been working for more than two years to get the report released, as the government has fought the disclosure, the Associated Press reported. But a federal judge in New York ordered it released in September 2017, and it was eventually given to the ACLU in August.\n\nRead more:\n\nA lost ancient city built by Trojan War captives has been found, Greek officials say\n\nDisney World banned a man who waved \u2018Trump 2020\u2019 banner on Splash Mountain\n\nCNN is suing the White House over Jim Acosta\u2019s press pass.

(Bullit Marquez/Associated Press)\n\nSINGAPORE \u2014 Leaders of Southeast Asian nations have again pushed back an agreement on a pan-Asian free trade deal amid a whirlwind of diplomacy Wednesday at their annual summit.\n\nIn convening talks among the leaders of countries participating in the plan, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said a final agreement on the deal, which is expected to encompass nearly half the world\u2019s population and 40 percent of world trade, will be delayed until 2019.\n\nLee\u2019s comments confirmed earlier expectations that the 16 countries in the plan, called the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, or RCEP, would not meet their goal of finalizing the accord this year.\n\nThe trade talks followed scores of bilateral meetings among the leaders and talks on other issues such as regional security, how to keep peace in the South China Sea and the crisis over hundreds of thousands of ethnic Rohingya Muslims who have fled to Bangladesh to escape violence in Myanmar.\n\nDuring the meetings in Singapore, Lee has championed the region\u2019s commitment to free trade and a multilateral approach to sorting out the issue \u2014 in contrast with U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerican First\u201d preference for bilateral trade deals and distrust of international institutions.\n\n\u201cWe are meeting at a critical time. Protectionism and anti-globalization sentiments are on the rise. This can have a devastating impact on the regional as well as the global economy, and business confidence in Asia is already being affected,\u201d Lee said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important that we redouble our economic integration efforts and maintain a free, open and rules-based multilateral trading system which has underpinned our growth and prosperity,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump withdrew from a Pacific Rim trade initiative, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, just after taking office last year. That trade pact is due to take effect on Dec. 30. The U.S. is not part of the RCEP initiative, which includes China, India, Australia and most other Asian economies.\n\nLee said participating countries had finished seven of 18 chapters in their agreement and shown \u201cstrong political will\u201d to finish it. He warned that further delays in reaching an agreement, already in negotiations for six years, would damage the RCEP\u2019s credibility.\n\n\u201cWe are now at the final stage of negotiations. With a strong momentum generated this year, I am pleased to note that the RCEP negotiations are poised for conclusion in 2019,\u201d he said.\n\nThe 10 Association of Southeast Asian Nations members are Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. Earlier Wednesday, the ASEAN leaders met with their counterparts from Australia, China, South Korea, Russia and Japan.\n\nManaging conflict in the South China Sea is a perennial concern. China is pitted against its smaller neighbors in multiple disputes in the sea over coral reefs and lagoons in waters crucial for global commerce and rich in fish and potential oil and gas reserves.\n\nWhile in Singapore, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang has sought to reassure China\u2019s neighbors.\n\n\u201cWe have found the way to properly manage and defuse differences, for example, on the issue of the South China Sea in the past years,\u201d Li said, adding that the situation was moving toward \u201cgreater stability\u201d with progress toward a single draft text on a code of conduct in the sea. He reiterated Beijing\u2019s hope to have a final agreement within three years.\n\nPhilippine President Rodrigo Duterte said such a code is needed \u201cat all cost\u201d to prevent dangerous miscalculations.\n\nThe Philippines softened its earlier harsh criticism of China\u2019s assertive moves in the disputed waters after Duterte sought to repair relations with Beijing once he took office in 2016 and sought infrastructure funding, trade and investment from Beijing.\n\nThe region already has a nonbinding \u201cDeclaration of Conduct\u201d but is working toward a more robust agreement, with China appearing to win support for its calls to ban involvement by outside powers, such as the United States, in maritime disputes.\n\nDuterte cited a risk of \u201cserious miscalculation\u201d and potential clashes that could trigger military action based on mutual defense treaties.\n\n\u201cSo you are there, so you are in possession, you have occupied it, but tell us what route we should take, what kind of behavior,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cEverything\u2019s been excellent between China and the rest of ASEAN except for the fact that there\u2019s friction between the Western nations and China,\u201d Duterte told reporters as he headed into meetings.\n\nWhile the Singapore meetings were typically focused on cooperation and goodwill, concerns over Myanmar\u2019s treatment of its ethnic Rohingya Muslims flared with unusually sharp comments to the country\u2019s leader, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.\n\nU.S. Vice President Mike Pence told Suu Kyi on Wednesday that the situation was inexcusable. He also took aim at Myanmar\u2019s arrest and imprisonment of two Reuters journalists.\n\nOn Tuesday, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed lambasted Suu Kyi for her handling of the crisis that led to mass killings and the exodus of more than 700,000 Rohingya from Buddhist-majority Myanmar since August 2017.\n\nMahathir, whose own country has a Muslim majority, said he told Suu Kyi that as a former political detainee, she should show more compassion.\n\n\u201cThey are actually oppressing these people to the point of, well, killing them, mass killing, and burial in graves dug by the victims and that kind of thing,\u201d said Mahathir, a 93-year-old political veteran whose own past treatment of dissidents at times drew opprobrium. \u201cThat may be relevant in ancient times, but in modern days, we don\u2019t do that kind of thing.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Opinion polls indicate Bainimarama is poised to win a second term in Fiji\u2019s general election Wednesday after he first held democratic elections in 2014, eight years after he seized power in a coup. (Richard Drew, File/Associated Press)\n\nSUVA, Fiji \u2014 The man who first seized power in a military coup then refashioned himself as a legitimate leader appears set to rule Fiji for another four years.\n\nPrime Minister Voreqe Bainimarama and his FijiFirst party were headed for a convincing election win early Thursday as votes were tallied. Bainimarama has ruled the island nation since his 2006 coup, and won his first election in 2014 after returning democracy to the country.\n\nWith about half of the votes counted, FijiFirst was ahead with 53 percent while closest rival the Social Democratic Liberal Party, led by Sitiveni Rabuka, was at 37 percent. The margin was closer than in the last election, when FijiFirst won almost 60 percent of the vote.\n\nRabuka led two military coups in the 1980s before serving seven years as prime minister in the 1990s. Just this week, a judge cleared him of an electoral disclosure violation in a case that many viewed as being politically motivated.\n\nHeavy rainfall throughout Wednesday affected voter turnout. The bad weather prompted officials to close more than 20 polling venues, affecting more than 7,000 voters who were promised the chance to vote at a later date.\n\nBefore voting ended, Supervisor of Elections Mohammed Saneem urged voters to brave the weather, saying low turnout needed \u201cto increase as much as possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe weather is a bit discouraging,\u201d said Akanisi Lal. That didn\u2019t stop the 53-year-old from taking a break from looking after her family to vote for Bainimarama.\n\n\u201cI have seen what he has been doing over the past four years,\u201d she said, citing policies such as free bus fares for seniors. \u201cHe will go deeper if he comes again in power.\u201d\n\nSome voters were reluctant to say who they voted for because of fear of reprisals. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be victimized,\u201d said Jashneel Kumar, a 24-year-old nurse.\n\nFiji has not allowed the political tensions to take a toll on its vital tourism industry, which promotes the Pacific nation\u2019s pristine, sunny beaches and friendly, welcoming people.\n\nGiven the history of coups, political stability was a big issue leading up to the election, as were racial tensions and economic issues.\n\nMany people in the nation of 920,000 seem appreciative of the economic gains they\u2019ve made under Bainimarama.\n\n\u201cThere are no school fees. Before, I paid a couple hundred for school fees,\u201d said Mere Rigamoto, a 42-year-old mother of three boys. \u201cBainimarama\u2019s government is not bad. He\u2019s OK.\u201d\n\nBut Bainimarama has a troubled political history that has contributed to the coup culture. There were rumors he could stage another coup should he lose the election.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re bound to have another coup if he doesn\u2019t win,\u201d said 30-year-old Robert Lum On, a recent university graduate.\n\nFiji became independent from the U.K. in 1970. In 1987, Rabuka staged two racially charged coups to return the country to the hands of indigenous Fijians, who make up about 57 percent of the population, and away from Fijians of Indian descent, who make up 38 percent.\n\nIndo-Fijians have been a major ethnic group in Fiji since colonial times, when the British brought them in to work the sugar cane plantations. Many Indo-Fijians favor Bainimarama, whose new constitution in 2013 removed race quotas from Parliament.\n\n\u201cBainimarama\u2019s key success has been to establish the name \u2018Fijian\u2019 for all citizens of Fiji,\u201d said Richard Herr, a professor at Fiji National University who is based in Australia. \u201cHis legislation has made campaigning on race, or even having a racially based party, illegal.\u201d\n\nOn the campaign trail, Bainimarama accused Rabuka of stoking the flames of racism that continue to divide the nation. But some indigenous Fijians believed Rabuka would help restore their prestige, and liked his promise to bring back the nation\u2019s Great Council of Chiefs, which Bainimarama disbanded.\n\nCritics deride Bainimarama as authoritarian, but since forcing himself into power, he has changed his image into that of a stable, legitimate leader. His appeal was bolstered when he assumed the U.N. COP23 presidency in November 2017. In that role, which he holds until December, he shaped Fiji into a pioneer on climate change issues.\n\nWith COP23 as a platform, Fiji inserted small island developing states into the international conversation on climate change. The islands are on the front lines of global warming, rising sea levels and ocean acidification.\n\nAfter the 2006 coup, Australia and New Zealand imposed sanctions on Fiji, and Bainimarama reoriented regional alliances toward China. His critics accuse him of selling out the country to the Chinese.\n\nThe Lowy Institute says Fiji received about $360 million in aid from China between 2006 and 2016, putting it behind only Papua New Guinea in the Pacific region. China Exim Bank holds 39 percent of Fiji\u2019s externally held public debt, according to The Economist Intelligence Unit.\n\nFiji\u2019s relations have since normalized with Australia and New Zealand, but the period of sanctions enabled China to step up its regional influence.\n\nFiji has one of the healthiest economies of the Pacific Islands, and GDP is predicted to grow above 3 percent annually through 2020. Tourism is the bedrock of the economy, accounting for more than 40 percent of GDP.\n\nBainimarama\u2019s government takes credit for increasing social services, including free primary and secondary education, free bus fares for seniors, and aid in the aftermath of cyclones. But widespread poverty persists. Bainimarama\u2019s opponents vowed to raise the minimum wage, which remains only about $1.25 per hour.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Nick Perry in Wellington, New Zealand, contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The centerpieces of the effort are mechanisms that would streamline the process of considering bills with broad bipartisan support on the House floor \u2014 at the price of eroding the power of the majority party\u2019s leadership to control what gets put up for a vote.\n\nSigning the letter are Reps. Josh Gottheimer (N.J.), Tom O\u2019Halleran (Ariz.), Jim Costa (Calif.), Kurt Schrader (Ore.), Daniel Lipinski (Ill.), Darren Soto (Fla.), Stephanie Murphy (Fla.), Tom Suozzi (N.Y.) and Vicente Gonzalez (Tex.).\n\n\u201cThe motivating purpose of all this is to get things done and to actually be able to work together and do things differently than we\u2019ve been doing,\u201d Gottheimer, a co-chairman of the caucus, said in an interview.\n\nThe Problem Solvers, whose efficacy has been in question, could represent more of a speed bump than a roadblock for Pelosi, who is facing a more serious uprising from a group of Democratic incumbents and incoming freshmen who are demanding new party leadership.\n\nPelosi spokesman Drew Hammill said Tuesday that she has already spoken positively about many of the reforms the Problem Solvers are pushing and that she has asked Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.), the incoming Rules Committee chairman, to work through possible changes to the House rules. Members of the incoming Democratic caucus are set to hear from McGovern about those proposals later this week, and it\u2019s unclear whether Pelosi would formally endorse any or all them by the Friday deadline.\n\nThe Problem Solvers also face this fact: No other Democrat has yet announced a challenge to Pelosi.", "SYDNEY \u2014 Regional security and the strengthening of ties with Japan and the U.S. will be high on the agenda for Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison when he meets leaders from both countries amid continuing concerns about the growing influence of China in the Asia-Pacific.\n\nMorrison will meet Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Friday, when Abe makes a flying visit to Darwin between a summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Singapore and the weekend\u2019s meeting of leaders of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation in Papua New Guinea. Abe will become the first Japanese leader to visit Darwin since the bombing of the northern Australian city by Japanese forces in World War II.\n\nMorrison will then hold meetings with U.S. Vice President Mike Pence during the APEC meeting in Port Moresby. Pence will use the northern Australian city of Cairns as his base for those meetings amid concerns over security in Papua New Guinea. It\u2019s expected several other APEC leaders will also stay in Cairns.\n\nTrade and investment will be a major focus of Morrison\u2019s meetings with Abe, who will use his Darwin trip to also visit Japan\u2019s biggest ever foreign investment, the $40 billion Ichthys gas project in which Japanese firm Inpex is the majority shareholder and operator. The project, which pipes offshore gas from the northwest Australian coast to Darwin, began its first shipments of liquefied natural gas to Japan last month.\n\nMorrison said he and Abe would also acknowledge those who served in World War II, in a pointed gesture in the northern port city that was bombed by Japanese forces in 1942, with the loss of 250 lives.\n\n\u201cPrime Minister Abe\u2019s visit is deeply symbolic and significant and it will build on our two countries\u2019 strong and enduring friendship as well as our economic, security, community and historical ties,\u201d Morrison said in a statement.\n\nThe meeting comes at a time when a key topic for Australia, its second-largest trading partner Japan and other Asian and South Pacific neighbors is how to respond to the growing influence of China, Australia\u2019s biggest trading partner.\n\nAustralia and Japan are expected to reach agreement in Darwin to facilitate larger and more regular joint military exercises, part of a strengthening of defense and economic ties amid growing uncertainty about American involvement in Asia under the Trump administration.\n\nNegotiations began in 2014 for the Reciprocal Access Agreement, which would make it easier for Japanese and Australian forces to visit either country with equipment for military exercises.\n\nAn official from Japan\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the Australian Financial Review newspaper this week that the two countries were \u201cat the final stage in discussions\u201d on the agreement, set to become the first pact on visiting forces Tokyo has signed outside of its arrangement with the U.S.\n\nJapan is also expected to welcome Australia\u2019s new foreign policy shift toward the southwest Pacific announced last week. Canberra will set up a 2 billion Australian dollar ($1.4 billion) fund to support infrastructure projects in the region, which fits with Japan\u2019s call for alternative sources of investment to China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative.\n\nMorrison will also meet Pence in Port Moresby, where the vice president is expected to deliver a speech at the APEC CEO Summit on Saturday morning continuing Washington\u2019s push against China\u2019s growing influence. Pence is due to talk just minutes after an address to the forum by Chinese President Xi Jinping. Morrison will also address the gathering\n\nAs the U.S. trade war with China continues, Pence is expected to maintain a hard line against Beijing, following a speech he delivered last month accusing China of stealing U.S. intellectual property, meddling in American elections and suppressing human rights.\n\nPence is also expected to increase pressure on China over its militarization of the disputed South China Sea, the need to maintain pressure on North Korea to denuclearize and on the fight against terrorism.\n\nPence\u2019s press secretary Alyssa Farah said he would \u201cdeliver the message that authoritarianism, aggression, and the disregard for other nations\u2019 sovereignty by any nation in the Indo-Pacific will not be tolerated by the United States.\u201d\n\nThe vice president is also expected to set out Washington\u2019s rival vision for the Indo-Pacific, promoting private investment over state-controlled funding to build regional infrastructure, in reaction to Chinese involvement in the South Pacific in recent years.\n\nIn an opinion piece for the Washington Post last weekend, Pence wrote: \u201cThe United States will work with like-minded nations \u2014 from India to the Pacific islands \u2014 to advance our shared interests. Together, we will stand up to anyone who threatens our interests and our values. The United States seeks collaboration, not control.\u201d\n\nAustralia will show off a heavy military presence around the APEC meeting to maintain security including a helicopter-landing ship, fighter jets and 500 troops to be stationed in Port Moresby.\n\nThe U.S., Japan, China, Canada, New Zealand and Indonesia are also contributing to security arrangements.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Jacquelyn Martin/AP)\n\nAs he jetted to Paris last Friday, President Trump received a congratulatory phone call aboard Air Force One. British Prime Minister Theresa May was calling to celebrate the Republican Party\u2019s wins in the midterm elections \u2014 never mind that Democrats seized control of the House \u2014 but her appeal to the American president\u2019s vanity was met with an ornery outburst.\n\nTrump berated May for Britain not doing enough, in his assessment, to contain Iran. He questioned her over Brexit and complained about the trade deals he sees as unfair with European countries. May has endured Trump\u2019s churlish temper before, but still her aides were shaken by his especially foul mood, according to U.S. and European officials briefed on the conversation.\n\nFor Trump, that testy call set the tone for five days of fury \u2014 evident in Trump\u2019s splenetic tweets and described in interviews with 14 senior administration officials, outside Trump confidants and foreign diplomats, many of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.\n\n\u201cHe was frustrated with the trip. And he\u2019s itching to make some changes,\u201d said one senior White House official. \u201cThis is a week where things could get really dicey.\u201d\n\nDuring his 43-hour stay in Paris, Trump brooded over the Florida recounts and sulked over key races being called for Democrats in the midterm elections that he had claimed as a \u201cbig victory.\u201d He erupted at his staff over media coverage of his decision to skip a ceremony honoring the military sacrifice of World War I.\n\nThe president also was angry and resentful over French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s public rebuke of rising nationalism, which Trump considered a personal attack. And that was after his difficult meeting with Macron, where officials said little progress was made as Trump again brought up his frustrations over trade and Iran.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just a bull carrying his own china shop with him when\u00adever he travels the world,\u201d presidential historian Douglas Brinkley said.\n\n\n\nPeople react in front of a large inflatable blimp depicting President Trump in Republique Square in Paris on Nov. 11, 2018. (Vadim Ghirda/AP)\n\nMeanwhile, Trump was plotting a shake-up in his administration. He told advisers over the weekend that he had decided to remove Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and that he also was seriously considering replacing White House chief of staff John F. Kelly, who scrambled early this week to try to save Nielsen\u2019s job.\n\nThe senior White House official, who speaks to the president regularly, said Trump has been grousing lately about getting rid of Kelly. \u201cBut he\u2019s done this three or four times before,\u201d this person said. \u201cNothing is ever real until he sends the tweet.\u201d\n\n[In Paris, a relatively understated Trump finds he\u2019s still the center of the world\u2019s attention \u2014 and outrage]\n\nDuring Sunday\u2019s flight to Washington from Paris, aides filed into the president\u2019s private cabin to lobby against the leading contender to replace Kelly, Nick Ayers, who is Vice President Pence\u2019s chief of staff. These aides told Trump that appointing Ayers would lower staff morale and perhaps trigger an exodus. But the president has continued to praise Ayers, who also enjoys the support of Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, according to multiple White House officials.\n\nFirst lady Melania Trump shared her husband\u2019s irritation and impatience with some of the staff. On Tuesday, amid reports that the president had decided to oust deputy national security adviser Mira R. Ricardel over tensions between her and other administration officials, the first lady\u2019s office issued an extraordinary statement to reporters calling for her firing.\n\n\u201cIt is the position of the Office of the First Lady that she no longer deserves the honor of serving in this White House,\u201d said Stephanie Grisham, the first lady\u2019s spokeswoman.\n\nMelania Trump said in an October interview with ABC News that the president had people working for him whom she did not trust and that she has let her husband know. \u201cSome people, they don\u2019t work there anymore,\u201d the first lady said.\n\n\n\nWhite House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly has been trying to save the job of Kirstjen Nielsen, the secretary of homeland security. (Kevin Lamarque/Reuters)\n\nIn her role as No. 2 to national security adviser John Bolton, Ricardel berated colleagues in meetings, yelled at military aides and White House professional staff, argued with Melania Trump regarding her recent trip to Africa and spread rumors about Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, according to three current and two former White House officials.\n\nKelly has sought for months to oust Ricardel, calling her a problematic hire in the West Wing, and Mattis has told advisers that he wants her out as well, the officials said.\n\nA National Security Council spokesman did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday.\n\nGrisham\u2019s statement was remarkable because it is so unusual for a first lady or her East Wing staff to weigh in on personnel matters elsewhere in the White House, particularly in the realm of national security.\n\nLast week, the tumult began even before Trump took off for Paris. After directing Attorney General Jeff Sessions to resign, controversy swirled around acting attorney general Matthew G. Whitaker\u2019s qualifications for the job, business entanglements and previous public opposition to the Russia investigation.\n\n[\u2018When you lose that power\u2019: How John Kelly faded as White House disciplinarian]\n\nAs Trump walked out of the White House residence to board the Marine One helicopter on Friday morning, he paused to answer questions from the press corps and snapped when CNN correspondent Abby Phillip asked whether he wanted Whitaker to rein in special counsel Robert S.

You ask a lot of stupid questions.\u201d\n\nLater, aboard Air Force One, Trump again lost his cool, this time during his phone call with May. He berated the British prime minister on Iran, trade and Brexit, among other topics. The White House did not announce that the call took place nor did it provide an official readout, but U.S. and European officials said in interviews that Trump\u2019s mood was sour and his conversation with May was acrimonious.\n\nOn his flight there and throughout the weekend, Trump was preoccupied by political developments back in the United States. He watched TV with rapt attention as late-counting votes resulted in the Senate race in Arizona and a number of House contests to slip out of Republican hands, and as recounts got underway in Florida\u2019s Senate and gubernatorial races. He also complained about the lack of congressional funding for his promised wall at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nTrump sent political aides in Washington scrambling to prepare detailed briefings for him on the still-to-be-called races. He aired baseless allegations of voter irregularities on Twitter \u2014 writing from the plane that elections attorney Marc Elias was the Democrats\u2019 \u201cbest Election stealing lawyer\u201d but that he would send \u201cmuch better lawyers to expose the FRAUD!\u201d\n\nStill, the president told aides he felt disconnected from the action in his suite at the U.S. ambassador\u2019s residence in Paris \u2014 even as he consumed countless hours of television news on the trip.\n\n\u201cTrump needs adulation, so heading into the midterms, holding these rallies, he was cheered and it became narcissistic fuel to his engine,\u201d Brinkley said. \u201cAfter the midterm, it\u2019s the sober dawn of the morning.\u201d\n\n\n\nRain pours on President Trump and his lectern with the presidential seal during the commemoration ceremony for Armistice Day at the Suresnes American Cemetery and Memorial in Paris on Nov. 11, 2018.

Fuentes that the Secret Service had concerns about flying Marine One through the rain and fog from Paris to the cemetery 50 miles away, and that a motorcade could be lengthy and snarl traffic in the area, according to one senior White House official.\n\nTrump chose not to make the trip, and Kelly, a retired Marine Corps general, and Marine Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, attended in his stead.\n\nBut Trump quickly grew infuriated by a torrent of tweets and media coverage suggesting that the president was afraid of the rain and did not respect veterans.\n\n[Critics pile on after Trump cancels visit to U.S. military cemetery outside Paris, citing weather]\n\nFormer secretary of state John F. Kerry, a decorated Navy veteran of the Vietnam War, tweeted: \u201cPresident @realDonaldTrump a no-show because of raindrops?

Rain didn\u2019t stop them & it shouldn\u2019t have stopped an American president.\u201d\n\nTrump told aides he thought he looked \u201cterrible\u201d and blamed his chief of staff\u2019s office, and Fuentes in particular, for not counseling him that skipping the cemetery visit would be a public-relations nightmare.\n\nTrump was still litigating the episode on Tuesday, when he tweeted from the White House that he suggested driving to the cemetery and \u201cSecret Service said NO, too far from airport & big Paris shutdown.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, he got angry at Macron for his remarks at a ceremony honoring the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I. The French president denounced rising nationalism around the world and called it a \u201cbetrayal of patriotism,\u201d with two of the world\u2019s leading nationalists \u2014 Trump and Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin \u2014 in attendance.\n\nTrump told advisers he considered Macron\u2019s comment a personal insult, and it came on the heels of a disagreement between the two leaders over Macron\u2019s call for a \u201ctrue European army.\u201d At their bilateral meeting on Saturday, Trump appeared subdued and almost sullen.\n\nOnce he was back home in Washington, Trump unloaded on his French counterpart, likening Macron\u2019s call for a European army to Germany\u2019s military expansion in World War I and World War II. Trump tweeted Tuesday morning, \u201cHow did that work out for France? They were starting to learn German in Paris before the U.S. came along. Pay for NATO or not!\u201d\n\nTrump also lashed out over trade agreements \u2014 \u201cNot fair, must change!\u201d he tweeted \u2014 that he argued make it easy for the United States to sell French wines but difficult for France to sell American wines.\n\nAnd then he attacked Macron for his unpopularity in France \u2014 while providing a bit of sloganeering advice.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that Emmanuel suffers from a very low Approval Rating in France, 26%, and an unemployment rate of almost 10%,\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter. \u201cHe was just trying to get onto another subject.

(Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nThe most diverse House freshman class in history convened Tuesday for the first time since last week\u2019s elections.\n\nBut of the two political parties\u2019 freshman gatherings, only one looked something like the country as a whole.\n\nThe incoming lawmakers \u2014 memorialized in a flier that circulated on Capitol Hill \u2014 are overwhelmingly white on the Republican side, with only one woman, while women and people of color are a majority of the newcomers on the Democratic side.\n\nAs the incoming members gathered at a hotel in Southeast Washington, several Democrats said they hoped that the diversity of their numbers would inform the party\u2019s approach to policy.\n\n\u201cIt brings a different perspective to the table,\u201d said Rep.-elect Kendra Horn (Okla.), the first Democratic woman elected to Congress from her state, adding: \u201cI\u2019m very excited to be part of this new class that looks a lot more like our communities.\u201d\n\nThe freshmen were projected ahead of the election to be younger, more female and more racially diverse, the embodiment of a coalition that helped Barack Obama win the White House in 2008. The new members include several firsts for Congress \u2014 the first Muslim women, the first Native American women and the first African American women from several states.\n\nThe diversity underscored a looming debate for Democrats ahead of 2020, when the party will choose its candidate to challenge President Trump. A large group of up-and-coming Democrats, including several women and minorities, have shown interest in presidential bids. Choosing a white man as the Democratic nominee would disappoint some of the party faithful.\n\nThe next Congress has already hit a long list of milestones. More than 100 women have been elected to the House, with 29-year-old Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) the youngest women to enter Congress. Many lawmakers of Latino or Asian heritage were elected or won fresh terms.\n\nThe Democratic gains were illustrated on the cover of the Nov. 19 issue of the New Yorker magazine, which depicted a room full of white men in outline as new political talents \u2014 drawn with detail in color \u2014 entered through the door.\n\nDave Wasserman, the House editor for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, recently calculated that the percentage of white men as a share of House Democrats is \u201cset to decline from 41 percent to 38 percent as a result of the 2018 election.\u201d\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, the percentage of white men as a share of House Republicans is on track to rise from 86 percent to 90 percent,\u201d he tweeted Sunday.\n\nThe story for House Republicans is different, with the party losing several female members to retirement or higher office, including Reps. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (Fla.), Lynn Jenkins (Kan.) and Gov.-elect Kristi L. Noem (S.D.).\n\nThe fate of two Republican women of color was uncertain late Tuesday, as Rep. Mia Love (Utah) trailed Democrat Ben McAdams in her suburban Salt Lake City district and Republican Young Kim, running for the House in Orange County, Calif., held a lead of roughly 2,000 votes over Democrat Gil Cisneros.\n\nNew members spent part of Tuesday in orientation, a multiday process that will teach them to find their way around Capitol Hill, run a congressional office and handle constituent casework.\n\nDemocrats, some seemingly overwhelmed by the crush of media attention, described wide-ranging policy priorities they hoped the party will focus on next year.\n\n\u201cHelping children and families, working on voting rights issues, working on criminal justice issues,\u201d said Rep.-elect Mary Gay Scanlon (Pa.).\n\n\u201cClimate change and renewable energy,\u201d said Rep.-elect Deb Haaland (N.M.), who is one of the first Native American women elected to Congress.\n\n\u201cHealth care and education,\u201d Oklahoma\u2019s Horn said.\n\nOther newly elected Democratic members will arrive in Congress already associated with certain policies.\n\nRep.-elect Lucy McBath (Ga.), a gun-control activist whose son was fatally shot six years ago, flipped a longtime Republican congressional seat outside Atlanta last week.\n\nThe younger bent of the incoming class was also on display, as Rep.-elect Joe Cunningham (D-S.C.) arrived at the hotel carrying his infant son.\n\nOcasio-Cortez drew attention for joining a protest in the office of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) over climate change.\n\n\u201cShould Leader Pelosi become the next speaker of the House, we need to tell her that we\u2019ve got her back in showing and pursuing the most progressive energy agenda that this country has ever seen,\u201d she said.\n\nMore than a hundred activists with the Sunrise Movement had streamed into Pelosi\u2019s office on Tuesday morning, delivering letters demanding that Pelosi commit to a Marshall Plan-size economic blueprint that would transition the country away from fossil fuels and toward renewable energy.\n\nIt was not enough, they said, to simply reestablish the select committee on climate change. Many protesters wore shirts that read \u201c12 years,\u201d a reference to estimates that by 2030, it will be impossible to wind back the effects of climate change.\n\n\u201cPelosi\u2019s plan on climate change is the equivalent of bringing a squirt gun to a raging drought-induced wildfire killing Americans right now,\u201d said Varshini Prakash, the Sunrise Movement\u2019s co-founder.\n\nOcasio-Cortez played down her own involvement.\n\n\u201cThis is not about me. This is not about the dynamics of any personalities,\u201d she told reporters. \u201cThis is about uplifting the voice, and the message, of the fact that we need a green New Deal.\u201d\n\nPelosi followed with a statement supporting the protesters but declining to specifically address their key demand.\n\n\u201cI have recommended to my House Democratic colleagues that we reinstate the select committee to address the climate crisis,\u201d Pelosi stated. \u201cHouse Democrats ran on and won on our bold campaign for a $1 trillion investment in our infrastructure that will make our communities more resilient to the climate crisis, while creating 16 million new good-paying jobs across the country.\u201d\n\nHaaland, who described addressing climate change as her key priority, said she also wanted to focus on health care and the issue of missing and slain indigenous women.\n\nShe left a gaggle of reporters to meet Rep.-elect Sharice Davids (D-Kan.), who is also Native American, for coffee.\n\n\u201cWe need to make Americans\u2019 lives better,\u201d she said.\n\nDavid Weigel contributed to this report.\n\nRead more at PowerPost", "The night after he and Draymond Green got into an argument that resulted in Green\u2019s one-game suspension for conduct detrimental to the team, Kevin Durant spoke about the incident, but his terse comments did little to put it to rest.\n\nGreen began arguing with Durant during the Golden State Warriors' loss Monday to the Los Angeles Clippers and the heated exchange reportedly continued into the locker room. As of Tuesday evening, the two had not met to resolve the problem, but Durant told reporters after the game Tuesday night against Atlanta that \u201cI\u2019m sure it will [be]. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a long season ahead.\u201d\n\nAccording to Chris Haynes of Yahoo Sports, Green repeatedly called Durant an expletive Monday after the latter expressed irritation that Green didn\u2019t pass him the ball in the closing seconds of regulation. Instead, Green dribbled the ball upcourt and into traffic, failing to get a shot off as the game went to overtime. Durant was asked after Tuesday\u2019s win over the Atlanta Hawks if Green had taken things too far.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna keep that in-house,\u201d said Durant, wearing a Redskins cap pulled low over his brow. \u201cThat\u2019s what we do here. I mean, obviously I know you guys got a job to do, but I\u2019m not trying to give nobody no headlines. What happened, happened. We\u2019re trying to move on \u2014 just trying to play basketball.\u201d\n\nDurant admitted that it was odd not to have Green in the lineup Tuesday, \u201cI mean, his presence has been a part of this team for a while,\u201d Durant said. \u201cEven before I got here. You know, he\u2019s been a huge staple in this organization. So, obviously it\u2019s definitely weird not having him around ... and just ... everything that went down. But that\u2019s what happens. S--- happens in the NBA. I just try to do my best to move on and be a basketball player. I don\u2019t got nothing else to do but to be the best player I can be every single day. I try not to worry about nothing else.\u201d\n\nIf he was surprised by the suspension, he wasn\u2019t giving that away. \u201cI was just focused on the game,\u201d Durant said. \u201cI didn\u2019t really care either way. I was just focused on trying to come out here and finish this back-to-back off.\u201d\n\nGreen is expected to be back when the Warriors' three-game road trip begins Thursday in Houston and his absence left Coach Steve Kerr and General Manager Bob Myers explaining the dust-up on a team that is usually relatively free of public drama.\n\n\u201cDraymond is always going to be who he is,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cDraymond is a powerful force. You guys know that. He\u2019s a huge reason why we\u2019ve had so much success here, and Draymond is going to continue playing the way he plays, and I don\u2019t see him operating any other way.\u201d\n\nMyers noted that \u201cbasketball\u2019s an emotional sport\u201d and that the team felt the blowup \u201crose to the level of acting the way we did.\u201d\n\nDuring the Warriors' huddle before the extra session Monday night, Green, Durant and other Golden State players could be seen having an animated discussion. Shams Charania of Yahoo Sports reported that Green \u201cchallenged\u201d Durant about the latter\u2019s \u201cimpending free agency,\u201d and that the entire episode was \u201ca simmering issue for the Warriors\u201d on Tuesday.\n\nAdrian Wojnarowski and Marc J. Spears of ESPN reported that witnesses described the ensuing locker room scene as \u201cone of the most intense of this Warriors era,\u201d although it never got physical. Klay Thompson surprised his teammates, per Haynes, when the usually quiet shooting guard addressed the room with a message about the importance of sticking together.\n\nBoth Kerr and Myers tamped down the notion that Durant\u2019s impending free agency this summer might have played a role in the incident or be affecting the locker room dynamics. Since arriving in Golden State as a free agent in 2016, Durant has passed up opportunities to sign long-term contracts and has instead chosen two-year deals with opt-out clauses after the first year. The nine-time all-star, who has earned back-to-back Finals MVP honors in leading the Warriors to consecutive NBA titles, is expected to again exercise the clause this summer and hit the market, although he may well end up staying with the Warriors.\n\nAsked Tuesday if Durant\u2019s possible departure in free agency was a \u201cfestering\u201d issue in the locker room, Myers said he did not think it was, instead pointing to how \u201chard\u201d it is to win championships and claiming, \u201cThat\u2019s all anybody\u2019s thinking about, because I think that\u2019s all you can think about.\u201d\n\n\u201cNobody ever talks about Kevin\u2019s free agency,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cWe\u2019re focused on this year.\u201d\n\nAs Anthony Slater of the Athletic pointed out Tuesday, though, that kind of ongoing contract situation caused stress and uncertainty in Cleveland when LeBron James continued to sign such deals rather than commit long-term to the Cavaliers. Nevertheless, most of the tension Monday, according to Slater, stemmed from Green\u2019s aggressive response to being questioned by teammates about his decision-making with the ball at the end of regulation.\n\nWhile making himself an indispensable member of the Warriors' dynasty, including another NBA title and a record 73-win season before Durant arrived, Green also has become known for his volatile, occasionally abrasive personality. Under Kerr, Golden State has been more than willing to try to manage that side of Green in exchange for his defensive and passing skills, as well as his overall intensity.\n\nESPN\u2019s Zach Lowe reported that some members of the Warriors organization were of a belief that Green \u201cwent too far\u201d on Monday, while other \u201care still shrugging this off.\u201d According to Sam Amick of the Athletic, Kerr made the decision to suspend Green for Tuesday\u2019s game.

It\u2019s dynamic, not static: Erratic changes in one country produce reactions in other countries. Alliances that once seemed solid become weaker and are recast; ambitious powers exploit new opportunities created by shifting dynamics; some countries rise, and others fall.\n\nLast weekend\u2019s events in Paris offered a dramatic demonstration that \u201cother things being equal\u201d is not a safe assumption. The world is moving to adapt to the reality that Donald Trump is president of the United States. Our friends and allies may hope his election eventually will be reversed, and maybe they think the United States turned a corner with the 2018 midterm elections. But they can\u2019t count on it, so these countries must consider that the United States may be a different country from what they had believed.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron articulated this reality last week. In one of his World War I remembrances, he told a French radio station that Europe needs a \u201ctrue European army\u201d at a time when the United States is a less reliable ally. \u201cWe have to protect ourselves with respect to China, Russia and even the United States of America,\u201d Macron said.\n\nTrump blasted Macron\u2019s comments as \u201cvery insulting,\u201d and he continued to complain in tweets Tuesday about French ingratitude and claimed that Macron was trying to distract from his \u201cvery low\u201d approval ratings. But joining Macron on Tuesday was German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who told the European parliament that she shared others\u2019 view that \u201ca common European army would show the world that there would never again be war in Europe.\u201d\n\nTrump set the NATO alliance wobbling from the day he took office, raising doubts about the United States\u2019 continued readiness to pay for other countries\u2019 defense. Europeans spent a year trying to make nice, but they seem to have gotten the message. The United States isn\u2019t a fully reliable protector anymore. Europeans indeed have to take greater responsibility for their defense \u2014 and depend less on a U.S.-led NATO. What Trump has done is folly, in my view, but it is precisely what he wanted.\n\nThe world is moving on, in other ways, from Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d idea of U.S. power. Macron announced Monday the \u201cParis Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace.\u201d The document proposed a basic code of conduct to prevent interference in elections and other malicious hacking. It was backed by more than 50 countries, 90 nonprofits and 130 private companies, including Microsoft, Google, Facebook and IBM. Absent from the list was the United States \u2014 along with Russia, China, Iran and Israel. Nice: the big five of cyberwar.\n\nBut the \u201cParis Call\u201d alliance of countries, corporations and nongovernmental organizations will probably move forward on cyberspace \u2014 just as a similar global coalition has remained intact to fight climate change, despite the Trump administration\u2019s refusal to participate.\n\nAs Trump\u2019s United States retreats from global diplomatic engagements, other opportunistic countries are stepping forward. The most obvious example is Russia. President Vladimir Putin may hold a weak hand, but he\u2019s in the game. Russia talks with everyone: Israel and Iran, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, the Taliban and the Afghan government. Putin may be a bully boy, but he\u2019s wearing a diplomat\u2019s pinstriped pants \u2014 sponsoring negotiations on Syria, Afghanistan and other issues. Once upon a time, America owned this role of global broker, but not anymore.\n\nThe greatest beneficiary of Trump\u2019s retreat is China, which openly proclaims its desire to challenge U.S. global primacy. A senior Australian official told me this week that everywhere Australia looks in Asia, it sees China seeking to find potential bases for its increasingly powerful military. Australia is one of the countries that has relied upon U.S. power, and officials still hope that\u2019s a good bet. But looking at Trump, they have to wonder.\n\nCommentators have noted that 1918 marked a global inflection point. After the horror of World War I, empires collapsed, aristocracies faded, aggrieved citizens challenged and eventually toppled the old order. Another transitional year was 1945, which began a half-century of overwhelming American global dominance.\n\nThe United States suffered a political hiccup in 2016, electing a man who was manifestly unprepared to be president. Most of the world hopes we\u2019ll find our balance again, but in the meantime, they must consider making other arrangements.\n\nRead more from David Ignatius\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.", "President Trump announced Tuesday that he will nominate retired Army Gen. John Abizaid to become the U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia, filling a vacancy that was spotlighted by the difficult diplomacy between the United States and Riyadh over the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nThe post has been vacant throughout Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\nTrump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have blamed Senate Democrats for holding up nominations, but no one had been nominated for the job until now. Turkey, where Washington Post contributing columnist Khashoggi was killed last month, also has no U.S. ambassador.\n\nAbizaid, best known from his time overseeing the Iraq War, is now a consultant and a fellow at Stanford University\u2019s Hoover Institution. His selection emphasizes the importance Trump has placed on the military partnership between the United States and Saudi Arabia, a major customer for U.S. arms.\n\nTrump has said he does not want to disrupt arms sales in protest of Khashoggi\u2019s death but has promised unspecified consequences for Saudi Arabia. Khashoggi was a U.S. resident.\n\nSaudi leaders initially denied any involvement by the kingdom in the death, but now acknowledge it was premeditated. King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman deny involvement.\n\n[U.S. says audio recording of Khashoggi killing does not implicate Saudi crown prince]\n\nPompeo and Trump\u2019s adviser, the president\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, have handled discussions with Riyadh directly, assuming some of the tasks that might have been done by a confirmed ambassador. Currently, a career State Department diplomat is in charge at the embassy.\n\nLast month, the Trump administration launched a public pressure campaign urging Saudi Arabia to end the conflict in Yemen amid growing opposition in Congress to U.S. military support for the kingdom\u2019s war there.\n\nPompeo and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis called for an end to more than three years of conflict between Houthi rebels and a government recognized by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and the West. U.N. officials have warned that the war has left half the population of Yemen, one of the world\u2019s poorest countries, on the precipice of famine.\n\nIf confirmed, Abizaid would succeed Joseph Westphal, a former Pentagon official chosen by President Barack Obama.\n\nUnder the Obama administration, Abizaid was tapped in 2016 to advise Ukrainian Defense Minister Stepan Poltorak. The Pentagon said at the time that the retired general would offer advice as Ukraine sought to reform and modernize its armed forces to more closely resemble Western militaries found in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\n\nAbizaid rose through the ranks to become the four-star chief of U.S. Central Command in July 2003, putting him in the position of overseeing the Iraq War a few months after the United States invaded and Baghdad fell. Over the next four years, he oversaw the conflict and operations in more than two dozen other countries, including Saudi Arabia, as insurgent violence escalated and the United States faced scandals including the abuse of detainees by U.S. soldiers at the Abu Ghraib prison near Baghdad.\n\nMore recently, Abizaid has advocated that the United States take a leading role in setting global norms for how drones are used by military forces and called for more transparency by the Pentagon involving them.\n\n\u201cThe United States\u2019 drone policies damage its credibility, undermine the rule of law and create a potentially destabilizing international precedent \u2014 one that repressive regimes around the globe will undoubtedly exploit,\u201d he wrote in a 2014 opinion piece along with former Pentagon official Rosa Brooks. \u201cAs lethal drones proliferate, the future imagined above is becoming all too likely.\u201d\n\nAbizaid also has called for the United States to find moderate centers of power in the Middle East and work with them, taking an active role there overall.\n\n\u201cSometimes you need to stand for something instead of saying it\u2019s all up to them,\u201d he said in a 2015 speech at the University of California at Berkeley. \u201cWe have to make ourselves reliable.\u201d", "President Trump speaks with French President Emmanuel Macron on Nov. 10, prior to their meeting at the Elysee Palace in Paris. (Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nPresident Trump took a peevish tone Tuesday as he revisited complaints about French President Emmanuel Macron, who used a weekend commemoration of the end of World War I to warn the president during his visit to Paris of the perils of the nationalist label he embraces and to suggest he has a lot to learn about history.\n\nMacron called nationalism a dangerous trap and the opposite of patriotism while invoking the bloodiest episodes of 20th-century European history.\n\nBut Trump has shown little patience for the lesson Macron tried to impart or the two days of praise the young French leader has received since his not-so-veiled criticism of his U.S. counterpart.\n\nInstead, Trump, who once avoided calling himself a nationalist, flaunted his embrace of the term and suggested that Macron do the same while arguing the French president was criticizing him to distract from his poor poll numbers.\n\n\u201cBy the way, there is no country more Nationalist than France, very proud people-and rightfully so!\u201d Trump tweeted Tuesday morning. He followed up with \u201cMAKE FRANCE GREAT AGAIN!\u201d\n\nThe taunts on Twitter showed again that Trump refuses to entertain arguments about the baggage that nationalism carries or show any signs that he is troubled by the historical antecedents to the rise of Nazism in Europe and its overlap with modern racists who call themselves \u201cwhite nationalists.\u201d\n\nIn fact, in his tweetstorm against Macron, Trump invoked the Nazi march across Europe \u2014 the very event the French president had warned of when he spoke about nationalism.\n\n\u201cEmmanuel Macron suggests building its own army to protect Europe against the U.S., China and Russia. But it was Germany in World Wars One & Two - How did that work out for France? They were starting to learn German in Paris before the U.S. came along. Pay for NATO or not!\u201d Trump wrote.\n\nFrench Ambassador G\u00e9rard Araud corrected Trump to note that Macron had not suggested that Europe needs defending against the United States, just that it should not assume it can rely on its ally, and added some advice for anyone cheering Trump on.\n\n\u201cYou should listen to Europe that has bred two WW and a genocide in two generations,\u201d Araud wrote on Twitter, referring to World War I and World War II. \u201cNationalism is dangerous. Subject to miscalculation and misperception, it always carries the risk of conflict. Patriotism and cooperation.\u201d\n\nTrump has tried to define his brand of nationalism as a form of patriotism devoid of the darker aspects his critics warn the term conjures.\n\n\u201cIt means I love the country, it means I\u2019m fighting for the country,\u201d Trump told Fox News host Laura Ingraham during an Oct. 29 interview, adding that he feels no need to clarify what he means by the term. \u201cI\u2019m proud of this country and I call that \u2018nationalism.\u2019 I call it being a nationalist and I don\u2019t see any other connotation than that.\u201d\n\nFor Trump, the terminology fits his political brand of anti-elitism, said University of Washington historian Margaret O\u2019Mara. It\u2019s similar to the \u201cAmerica First\u201d slogan he has trumpeted since his presidential campaign, always shrugging off criticism about whether he was nodding to anti-immigrant fervor and isolationism.\n\n\u201cMy inclination is that he does not really know the history because he\u2019s, self-admitted, not a big book reader and not someone who marinates in this stuff,\u201d O\u2019Mara said. \u201cTrump may or may not be thinking about Lindbergh when he talks, but it\u2019s very effective for the political base he\u2019s trying to reach \u2014 positioning himself as the adversary of these global elites, against internationalism.\u201d\n\nAviator Charles Lindbergh, who wrote about \u201cEuropean blood\u201d as the most precious American commodity, became the spokesman for a nativist, nationalist, antiwar movement called the America First Committee, which sought to keep the United States out of World War II. It was never a far leap from the \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda and the \u201cnationalist\u201d label, but Trump had not made such a direct link before the midterm election campaign.\n\nBoth terms hark back to dark periods of American history, and \u201cnationalism\u201d has become the preferred term for some white-power activists.\n\nCampaigning in Houston on Oct. 23, Trump tried out the term.\n\n\u201cThey have a word, it sort of became old-fashioned, it\u2019s called a nationalist,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I say, \u2018Really, we\u2019re not supposed to use that word.\u2019 You know what I am? I\u2019m a nationalist, okay? I\u2019m a nationalist. Nothing wrong. Use that word. Use that word.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s use of the term was cheered by former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke, who tweeted that Trump was really referring to white nationalism.\n\n\u201cThere is no ethnic or racial group in America more Nationalist than White Americans,\u201d Duke wrote.\n\nTrump says he is not a racist and does not endorse the views of Duke or others who call themselves white nationalists. But using the term is encouragement to those views, and it speaks to a rejection of the caution and centrism that past presidents have tended to adopt as they settled into the job, said Allan Lichtman, a presidential historian at American University.\n\n\u201cI generally see a progression on the part of the president to becoming more reckless, to really articulate controversial, outlandish things without regard to the consequences,\u201d Lichtman said. \u201cThe more outlandish things he says, the more cheers he gets at his rallies and that\u2019s what he cares about.\u201d\n\nTrump has had to contend before with the uncomfortable overlap between his message and political base and racism. During the 2016 campaign, Trump reposted a Twitter message from someone called \u201cWhiteGenocideTM.\u201d As president, Trump was criticized for equivocating about the culpability of white-power activists whose rally in Charlottesville ended in the death of a counterprotester.\n\nNicholas J. Fuentes, a white nationalist YouTube personality who attended that \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally in 2017, live-tweeted election results as Democrats won control of the House on Nov. 6. He praised Trump and criticized national Republican leaders he views as too moderate or timid.\n\n\u201cThe next two years will be tough but not impossible,\u201d Fuentes wrote. \u201cHopefully this will be a wake up call [for Republicans] and most importantly Trump that the Heritage agenda just won\u2019t win elections anymore. We have to fully embrace populist-nationalism or we\u2019ll fail.\u201d", "One week after Election Day, high-stakes contests in Florida and Georgia remained mired in uncertainty amid expanding legal fights and political wrangling that could further prolong the counting of ballots.\n\nIn Florida, where elections officials are conducting machine recounts in the races for Senate, governor and agriculture commissioner, Sen. Bill Nelson (D) and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee filed a suit in federal court Tuesday evening seeking to extend the deadline to finish the count in all 67 counties.Separately, Nelson and the state party went to court to try to loosen the rules for a manual recount as both parties braced for the ultra-close Senate race to come down to a hand inspection of ballots.\n\nOn Capitol Hill, Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) urged Florida elections officials to take as much time as they need to tally votes, even if they blow past a key deadline. He also demanded that Gov. Rick Scott (R), who is narrowly ahead of Nelson in the Senate race, recuse himself from the recount. Scott\u2019s campaign swiftly rejected that notion, which is the subject of a suit expected to be heard in federal court this week.\n\nIn Georgia, a federal judge late Monday barred the secretary of state\u2019s office from immediately certifying the state election results there to give voters a chance to address questions about their provisional ballots \u2014 a move that further prolongs the hard-fought Georgia governor\u2019s race between Democrat Stacey Abrams and Republican Brian Kemp.\n\nAnd from Maine to California and in between, 10 House races were still unresolved \u2014 leaving the size of the Democrats\u2019 majority undetermined as new lawmakers reported to Capitol Hill for orientation.\n\nThe unsettled races extended the intense partisan combat that gripped the country during this year\u2019s campaigns.\n\n\n\nMiami-Dade Election Center supervisors recount ballots Monday. (C.M. Guerrero/AP)\n\nIn Florida, the Senate race will determine the size of the GOP\u2019s majority in 2019 and shape the power structure in the nation\u2019s largest swing state. Elections officials face a deadline of 3 p.m. Thursday to complete machine recounts of three statewide races. Observers expect the margins in the Senate and agriculture commissioner contests to remain narrow enough after the machine counts to trigger hand recounts.\n\nThe suit filed by Nelson on Tuesday aims to stop the state canvassing board from certifying the results before all 67 counties complete their machine and manual recounts. In their filing, Democrats noted that officials in Palm Beach County have said it may be impossible to meet the deadlines.\n\nOn Tuesday night, Susan Bucher, the supervisor of elections for Palm Beach County, announced that vote-counting machines had overheated and stopped working \u2014 requiring staff to redo a recount of 174,900 early-vote ballots that took a day and a half to get through the first time.\n\n\u201cWe are disappointed by the mechanical problems,\u201d Bucher said. \u201cWe\u2019re working 24/7 to get the job done.\u201d\n\nThe defendants of the latest suit by Democrats include the members of the Florida Elections Canvassing Commission, which is required to certify the final results by Nov. 20. Under Florida law, if local officials fail to meet that deadline, the state will certify the previously reported, pre-recount totals.\n\n\u201cThis process is about one thing \u2014 making sure that every legal ballot is counted and protecting the right of every Floridian to participate in our democracy. And that is to have their ballot counted and to count as they intended,\u201d Nelson told reporters in Washington.\n\nStanding next to Nelson, Schumer said officials \u201cshould have all the time they need to count every Floridian\u2019s ballot, to make sure the candidate with the most votes is actually seated in January, even if the vote count has to go beyond Sunday.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt looks like @SenBillNelson is cutting out the middle man and letting @ChuckSchumer speak directly for him,\u201d Scott\u2019s campaign said on Twitter. \u201cChuck - we won\u2019t let DC lawyers and N.Y. senators steal this election from the people of Florida.\u201d\n\nTim Cerio, an attorney for Scott, said on a call with reporters that \u201cthe idea that deadlines don\u2019t matter in elections is an in\u00adcred\u00adibly partisan and irresponsible comment.\u201d\n\nThere is also building tension in Georgia, where Abrams is hoping to force a runoff with Kemp, who is leading by about 59,000 votes in the governor\u2019s race.\n\nTuesday was the deadline for Georgia\u2019s 159 counties to finalize their election results, and the secretary of state had planned to certify them Wednesday. But U.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg said late Monday that the secretary of state\u2019s office could not do so before Friday and had to \u201cimmediately establish and publicize on its website a secure and free-access hotline or website for provisional ballot voters to access to determine whether their provisional ballots were counted and, if not, the reason why.\u201d\n\n[Federal judge delays certification of Georgia election results, citing concerns over provisional ballots]\n\nKemp, who resigned as secretary of state late last week and declared victory, said there are not enough outstanding votes to keep him from winning. Lauren Groh-Wargo, Abrams\u2019s campaign manager, told reporters that as of Tuesday, Abrams needed 20,595 votes to force a runoff and 18,259 to initiate a recount.\n\nThe secretary of state\u2019s office has reported that 21,190 provisional ballots were cast in the Nov. 6 election.\n\nThe Republican advantage in the Senate race in Florida is even slimmer. Scott led Nelson by fewer than 13,000 votes after the initial count, or 0.15 percent. A margin of 0.25 percent or smaller would trigger a manual recount.\n\nThe Senate election has caught the attention of President Trump, who leveled another unsubstantiated allegation Tuesday against administrators in Broward and Palm Beach counties and suggested Nelson should bow out.\n\n\u201cThe characters running Broward and Palm Beach voting will not be able to \u2018find\u2019 enough votes, too much spotlight on them now!\u201d the president tweeted.\n\nTrump\u2019s comments marked the latest attempt by Republicans, including Scott, to try to undermine confidence in the process. But state officials said they have seen no signs of criminal activity or fraud in the vote tallying.\n\nThe recount kicked off over the weekend in many Florida counties. But Broward, the state\u2019s second-most-populous county, began counting ballots only Tuesday morning. Republicans have complained about the pace in the Democratic stronghold.\n\nAbout midday at the Broward elections office in Lauderhill, Joe D\u2019Alessandro, director of election planning and development, carried in five bins of recounted ballots with \u201cunder votes\u201d and \u201cover votes,\u201d to be set aside for closer scrutiny in the event of a hand recount.\n\nOn those ballots, voters did not choose a candidate or chose more than one. The chair of the canvassing board, Broward Judge Betsy Benson, instructed him to put the bins in a corner \u201cwhere they will always be in public view.\u201d She asked whether more bins would be coming.\n\n\u201cThere will be a lot more,\u201d D\u2019Alessandro replied.\n\nBy midafternoon, Broward County had finished recounting early votes. But it still had more than 400,000 ballots left to tally.\n\n\u201cWe will complete the recount,\u201d said Brenda Snipes, the elections supervisor in Broward County. \u201cThere\u2019s never been a deadline that we\u2019ve missed.\u201d\n\nAsked about the latest attack from Trump, Snipes said: \u201cWell, I don\u2019t have a treasure trove for going out digging on the beach somewhere to find any votes.\u201d She said she had never met Trump \u201cother than seeing him from television, and he hasn\u2019t met me.\u201d\n\nAfter Snipes noted that she was appointed to replace another black woman who was removed from office, she was asked whether she thought her race was a factor in the criticism of her management. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of hard to rule out,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd she hinted that she is not likely to run for reelection in 2020. \u201cIt is time to move on,\u201d said Snipes, a Democrat.\n\nSeveral pro-Trump Facebook pages and one Twitter account on Monday posted the home address and phone number of Snipes \u2014 a tactic called \u201cdoxing\u201d that often is a step toward harassment of people in the public spotlight and is prohibited by Facebook, Twitter and most other online platforms.\n\n[As recount politics heat up, two Florida election officials are the targets of online harassment]\n\nFacebook confirmed Tuesday that it had removed personal information about Snipes after the incident was reported to the company. Twitter declined to comment. Two tweets from an account visible Tuesday morning were deleted by noon.\n\nIn neighboring Miami-Dade County, the most populous in the state, Mayor Carlos Gimenez said Monday he was \u201cvery confident we\u2019re going to get this done on time.\u201d\n\nBut several variables could complicate the recount \u2014 most notably the mounting legal disputes.\n\nOne of the new suits filed by Democrats on Tuesday seeks to widen the latitude of canvassers to determine voter intent when and if they start examining ballots manually.\n\nIn another case, a court Wednesday will hear a request from Nelson to count absentee and provisional ballots that were not tallied because voters\u2019 signatures did not match their voter registration records \u2014 which could affect as many as 4,000 absentee ballots.\n\nSeparately, Scott withdrew his lawsuit against Palm Beach County seeking to impound the election equipment not in use for the recount, a day after a judge denied a similar request in Broward County.\n\nWhile Scott has been a vocal critic of Democrats during the recount, Republican gubernatorial nominee Ron DeSantis has been much quieter. DeSantis, a close Trump ally, has a more comfortable margin over Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum (D). Democrats and Republicans are not anticipating a hand recount in the governor\u2019s race.\n\nCongressional officials were also keeping tabs on the House races that have yet to be called. They include contests in Maine\u2019s sprawling 2nd District, where Rep. Bruce Poliquin (R) filed a lawsuit rejecting the state\u2019s tabulation of ranked-choice ballots, and a pair of Republican-held districts in California where the GOP candidates were narrowly ahead but losing ground.

(David Longstreath, File/Associated Press)\n\nBANGKOK \u2014 The death of a 13-year-old boy who was knocked out during a kickboxing match in Thailand has sparked debate over whether to ban matches involving children.\n\nThe death of Anucha Tasako came after a Muay Thai \u2014 Thai boxing \u2014 match Saturday in the Bangkok suburb of Samut Prakarn. The Facebook page Muaythai Krobwongjorn, which covers the sport, said he died from a brain hemorrhage. Protective gear is normally not worn in the sport, and video circulated on social media said to be of the fight shows Anucha not wearing any.\n\nChild boxing is widespread in Thailand, especially in rural areas, where it offers a way for children to help provide for their families and a path to lift them out of poverty, according to its advocates. Opponents say the sport is dangerous, citing studies such as one published last month by Thailand\u2019s Mahidol University saying that allowing children under 15 to box could result in various types of brain damage.\n\nThai lawmakers are considering legislation proposed last month banning children under 12 from competitive boxing. The legislation has been forwarded to the Ministry of Tourism and Sports, which has already drafted a revised version, said Gen. Aduldej Intapong, a member of the National Legislative Assembly.\n\nKickboxing is one of the most popular sports in Thailand and its boosters oppose regulating it.\n\n\u201cThis would have a major impact on the industry,\u201d Sukrit Parekrithawet, a lawyer who represents several boxing training camps, said of the proposed legislation. \u201cThose who drafted the law do not know anything about the sport of Thai boxing, and this would make Muay Thai become extinct.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t allow younger players to learn their way up, how can they be strong and experienced enough to fight?\u201d he said. \u201cWe call it \u2018boxing bones.\u2019 You need to have boxing bones built from a very young age.\u201d\n\nSukrit said the death of the 13-year-old, who fought under the name Petchmongkol S. Wilaitong, was a one-off incident and the result of a poorly organized event.\n\n\u201cThis has never happened before and it\u2019s unprecedented,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are several factors involved which have nothing to do with age. The referee wasn\u2019t quick enough to stop the fight and the venue didn\u2019t have a doctor on standby, which shouldn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nPublic television station ThaiPBS reported that Anucha had fought more than 170 matches since he began boxing at the age of 8, and was currently fighting in the under 41 kilogram (under 90 pound) weight division. It said he was raised by his uncle, who is a boxing trainer, after his parents separated.\n\nThe uncle, Damrong Tasako, told Thai PBS that Anucha\u2019s death was an accident but he would like to see regulations for children under 15 to wear protective gear to soften blows to the head and body.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

That commitment is expected to yield an additional 25,000 to 35,000 graduates over the next two decades.\n\nAt George Mason University, an institute will be created to focus on digital innovation, and a new school of computing will be established. More than 5,000 students are enrolled in its computing programs, but with the Amazon decision the school expects the number of students seeking such degrees to triple.\n\nThe commonwealth has committed up to $125 million over the next 20 years to expand George Mason\u2019s Arlington campus with an emphasis on research and graduate education in technology, according to university officials. The school will match that figure.\n\n\u201cThis is a watershed moment that is going to really rebrand Greater Washington and Virginia as a hub of information technology,\u201d George Mason President \u00c1ngel Cabrera said. \u201cThis puts us on the map in a really major way.\u201d\n\nJames E. Ryan, president of the University of Virginia, said in a statement Tuesday that U-Va. is looking forward to working with Amazon and other universities in Virginia. U-Va. has been expanding its programs in Northern Virginia over the past decade and plans to do even more.\n\n\n\nA rendering of the planned Innovation Campus. (Courtesy of Virginia Tech)\n\nSands said Virginia Tech had been working on the idea of an innovation campus for about four years, but a little over a year ago, state officials asked the university to lead a higher-education package that would be part of the region\u2019s bid to Amazon. That accelerated the process \u2014 especially with a $250 million funding commitment from the commonwealth.\n\nVirginia Tech will match that, with the remaining cost of the campus covered by private donations, industry partnerships and other revenue streams.\n\n\n\nVirginia Tech President Tim Sands. (Jim Stroup)\n\nThe Virginia Tech Innovation Campus will be focused on computer science and software engineering, with specializations in areas including artificial intelligence, cybersecurity and data analytics.\n\nNext year, the first 100 students are expected to begin studying in a temporary space, but within five years, the university envisions 500 students on the campus. Ultimately, Virginia Tech expects to have 750 master\u2019s degree candidates and hundreds of doctoral candidates and postdoctoral fellows enrolled.\n\nSands said he expects a significant amount of money to be committed toward expanding enrollment in tech fields at many campuses in Virginia.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be scaling up significantly to meet the new challenge,\" he said.\n\nDavid J. Skorton, secretary of the Smithsonian Institution and former president of Cornell University, compared the innovation campus to the Cornell Tech project he helped launch in New York. Cornell Tech \"reinvented graduate tech education for the digital age and is further energizing the start-up culture in New York City,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m thrilled Virginia Tech\u2019s leaders have stepped up to create a similar innovation hub.\u201d\n\nSheila Martin, vice president of economic development and community engagement for the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities, said she wasn\u2019t surprised Amazon picked Northern Virginia and New York as the locations for new headquarters, because a company like Amazon is dependent on a high-skills workforce and the research that comes out of universities.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a validation of the fact that universities are drivers of the growth and innovation in our economy,\u201d she said. If the company were looking for the lowest-cost place to do business, it would have chosen other sites, she said, but it knows the workforce drives competitiveness and productivity and is willing to pay for that.\n\nAna Mari Cauce, president of the University of Washington in Seattle, knows what it\u2019s like to have a clutch of technology companies in the area, including Boeing, Microsoft and Amazon. They provide internships and job opportunities for students and graduates, help attract top faculty, and contribute to student scholarships, faculty chairs, research labs and new buildings. \u201cWe would not be the highly innovative university that we are without robust partnerships with the tech businesses in our area,\u201d she wrote in an email Tuesday, \"and they wouldn\u2019t be as successful without their partnerships with us.\u201d\n\nA tech boom can also bring challenges. \u201cIt\u2019s also important to acknowledge that the rapid growth of these companies puts a strain on the housing market,\" Cauce wrote, \u201cdriving up rents and housing costs, and in Seattle, this has created real challenges to making affordable housing available, including for the people who teach and work at our public university.\u201d\n\nRobert McCartney contributed to this report.", "Central American migrants and others look on along the border structure, in Tijuana, Mexico Wednesday, Nov. 14, 2018. Migrants in a caravan of Central Americans scrambled to reach the U.S. border, catching rides on buses and trucks for hundreds of miles in the last leg of their journey Wednesday as the first sizable groups began arriving in the border city of Tijuana. (Gregory Bull/Associated Press)\n\nTIJUANA, Mexico \u2014 Migrants in a caravan of Central Americans arrived in Tijuana by the hundreds Wednesday, getting their first glimpse of the robust U.S. military presence that awaits them after President Donald Trump ordered thousands of troops to the border.\n\nSeveral hundred people from the caravan got off buses and made their way to a shelter on the Mexican side near the border to line up for food. Doctors checked those fighting colds and other ailments while several dozen migrants, mostly single men, spent the night at a Tijuana beach that is cut by a towering border wall of metal bars.\n\nSeveral Border Patrol agents in San Diego watched them through the barrier separating the U.S. and Mexico. American troops carrying machine guns stood near the agents next to recently installed concertina wire atop a stretch of the barrier.\n\nThe first wave of migrants in the caravan, which became a central theme of the recent U.S. election, began arriving in Tijuana in recent days, and their numbers have grown each day. The bulk of the main caravan appeared to be about 1,100 miles (1,800 kilometers) from the border, but has recently been moving hundreds of miles a day by hitching rides on trucks and buses.\n\nMany of the new arrivals were waiting in Tijuana to make their next step to enter in the U.S., either by illegally crossing the border or by seeking asylum at a port of entry.\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, meanwhile, visited U.S. troops posted at the border in Texas and said the deployment provides good training for war, despite criticism that the effort is a waste of taxpayer money and a political stunt. Most of the troops are in Texas, more than 1,500 miles from where the caravan is arriving.\n\nThe first arrivals generally received a warm welcome from Tijuana, despite the fact that its shelter system to house migrants is at capacity. The city\u2019s secretary of economic development has said there are about 3,000 jobs for migrants who want to stay in the city. Some residents came down to where the men were camped on a beach and gave them tacos to eat Wednesday.\n\nThe Central Americans in the caravan are the latest migrants to arrive in Tijuana with the hope of crossing into the United States. Tijuana shelters in 2016 housed Haitians who came by the thousands after making their way from Brazil with plans to get to the U.S. Since then, several thousand Haitians have remained in Tijuana, finding work. Some have married local residents and enrolled in local universities.\n\n\u201cMexico has been excellent; we have no complaint about Mexico. The United States remains to be seen,\u201d said Josue Vargas, a migrant from Honduras who finally pulled into Tijuana on Wednesday after more than a month on the road.\n\nDouglas Matute, 38, of Honduras, said he arrived Wednesday in a convoy of nine buses. Matute, who joined the caravan with his brother to flee violence and poverty, said he heard rumors that Canada and European countries would offer work visas and said he was also holding out hope that the U.S. Congress would pave the way for him to legally enter the country. Until a clearer picture emerged, he said, he would stay in Tijuana and wouldn\u2019t attempt to cross the border illegally.\n\nA few people pitched tents at the Tijuana beach plaza while most, like Henry Salinas, 30, of Honduras, planned to sleep there in the open.\n\nHe said that he intended to wait for thousands more in the caravan to arrive and that he hoped to jump the fence in a large group at the same time, overwhelming Border Patrol agents.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be all against one, one against all. All of Central America against one, and one against Central America. ... All against Trump, and Trump against all,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Tuesday, a couple of dozen migrants scaled the steel border fence to celebrate their arrival, chanting \u201cYes, we could!\u201d One man dropped over to the U.S. side briefly as border agents watched from a distance. He ran quickly back to the fence.\n\nTijuana\u2019s head of migrant services, Cesar Palencia Chavez, said authorities offered to take the migrants to shelters immediately, but they initially refused.\n\n\u201cThey wanted to stay together in a single shelter,\u201d Palencia Chavez said, \u201cbut at this time that\u2019s not possible\u201d because shelters are designed for smaller groups and generally offer separate facilities for men, women and families.\n\nBut he said that after their visit to the border, most were taken to shelters in groups of 30 or 40.\n\nOn Wednesday, buses and trucks carried some migrants into the state of Sinaloa along the Gulf of California and farther northward into the border state of Sonora.\n\nThe Rev. Miguel Angel Soto, director of the Casa de Migrante in the Sinaloa capital of Culiacan, said about 2,000 migrants had arrived in that area. He said the state government, the Roman Catholic Church and city officials in Escuinapa, Sinaloa, were helping the migrants.\n\nThe priest said the church had been able to get \u201cgood people\u201d to provide buses for moving migrants northward. He said 24 buses had left Escuinapa on an eight-hour drive to Navojoa in Sonora state.\n\nSmall groups were also reported in the northern cities of Saltillo and Monterrey, in the region near Texas.\n\nAbout 1,300 migrants in a second caravan were resting at a stadium in Mexico City, where the first group stayed several days last week. By early Wednesday, an additional 1,100 migrants from a third and last caravan also arrived at the stadium.\n\nLike most of those in the third caravan, migrant Javier Pineda is from El Salvador, and hopes to reach the United States. Referring to the first group nearing the end of the journey, Pineda said, \u201cif they could do it, there is no reason why we can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nMexico has offered refuge, asylum and work visas to the migrants, and its government said Monday that 2,697 temporary visas had been issued to individuals and families to cover them during the 45-day application process for more permanent status. Some 533 migrants had requested a voluntary return to their countries, the government reported.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Elliot Spagat reported in Tijuana, Mexico, and AP writer Maria Verza reported from Escuinapa, Mexico.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The 13-member selection committee sustained its professionalism and refused any temptation for mischief when it flew to Dallas-Fort Worth, spent hours meeting and ruminating, then dispensed a top 10 identical to that of last week.\n\nThat surpassed the flatlining week of Nov. 25, 2014, when the committee kept the top seven teams constant from Nov. 18, the previous frivolous record.\n\nThis time, as with that time, Alabama remained No. 1, a position it has held for 15 of the 28 weeks since the concept of a four-team playoff and the weekly rankings leading to it began with the 2014-15 season. In its heyday of heydays this decade, the Crimson Tide (10-0) has appeared in the top four in 24 of the 28 listings across five seasons, and in 24 of the past 25.\n\nFamiliarity insisted at No. 2 as well, when Clemson (10-0) stayed there as it has for all three rankings weeks this season. The Tigers\u2019 27-7 win at then-No. 17 Boston College on Saturday couldn\u2019t quite boost them past Alabama, and its 24-0 home win against then-No. 16 Mississippi State. Clemson has appeared in the top four in 21 of the 28 listings and in all of the past 21.\n\nFrom there, as with last week, came two teams that played each other on Sept. 1: No. 3 Notre Dame (10-0) and No. 4 Michigan (9-1). The Fighting Irish will have a chance to put some cement on that ranking Saturday when they head to the Bronx to play Syracuse (8-2), which climbed a notch to No. 12.\n\n[As football conference championship races wind down, which ones matter?]\n\nMichigan remained ahead of No. 5 Georgia (9-1) in a case of two teams with identical records and similar CVs. \u201cMichigan has a very strong r\u00e9sum\u00e9,\u201d committee chairman Rob Mullens, the athletic director at Oregon, said in a conference call. \u201cThey\u2019ve won nine games in a row. Their only loss was to the No. 3-ranked team\u201d way back in the first weekend. He cited the Wolverines\u2019 No. 1 defense alongside its wins at No. 22 Northwestern, at previously ranked Michigan State and at home against No. 14 Penn State.\n\nHe also cited Georgia\u2019s surge since it got ransacked on Oct. 13 at LSU, a recovery featuring wins over No. 13 Florida, the highest three-loss team on the list, No. 17 Kentucky and previously ranked Auburn.\n\nNone of the top 10 teams lost last week, a rare turn of calm in a sport often beloved for its turbulence. The highest-ranked team to lose was No. 11 Kentucky, which fell to No. 17 and to 7-3 because it lost at its eternal nemesis, Tennessee. Beyond that, the only teams to lose to anyone beneath them were No. 14 North Carolina State, No. 21 Iowa and No. 23 Fresno State.\n\nThe committee omitted those from its list but proved more forgiving to No. 16 Mississippi State and No. 17 Boston College, dropping them to Nos. 21 and 20, respectively. The previous teams at Nos. 18 and 24, Michigan State and Auburn, also lost to higher-ranked teams but vanished.\n\n[These college football teams are displaying the art of the in-season turnaround]\n\nKentucky\u2019s loss caused another rankings milestone by enabling Central Florida (9-0) to slide upward to No. 11. That became the highest ranking to date for any team from the second tier of the top rung of the sport, known as the Group of Five. It bested the No. 12 with which an unbeaten UCF finished last season, and the No. 12 it had held down the first two weeks of this season, much to its ambitious chagrin.\n\n\u201cSimilar to past weeks,\u201d Mullens said of the UCF considerations. \u201cObviously we saw their game against Navy and the win. Obviously their offense continues to perform, [quarterback] McKenzie Milton\u2019s a special talent, but the strength of schedule continues to be part of the discussion, and that\u2019s why they\u2019re No. 11.\u201d\n\nAfter ranking only two Group of Five teams in its first two lists, the committee did bring four into the light this week: UCF, No. 23 Utah State (9-1), No. 24 Cincinnati (9-1) and No. 25 Boise State (8-2). The top-ranked Group of Five team at the end of the season receives a bid into a major New Year\u2019s Six bowl.\n\n[Saturday\u2019s winners and losers: Bedlam, Northwestern and a lot of chalk]\n\nSitting outside the top four were No. 5 Georgia (9-1), No. 6 Oklahoma (9-1), No. 7 LSU (8-2), No. 8 Washington State (9-1), No. 9 West Virginia (8-1) and No. 10 Ohio State (9-1). Four of those six \u2014 Georgia, Oklahoma, West Virginia and Ohio State \u2014 figure to have remaining chances for emphatic statements. Georgia already has clinched passage to play Alabama in the SEC title game of Dec. 1. Oklahoma and West Virginia have a date with each other in Morgantown, W.Va., on the night after Thanksgiving, which they will reach after Oklahoma plays at home against Kansas and West Virginia visits Oklahoma State. Ohio State, after its visit to Maryland this weekend, will return home to see Michigan.\n\nWashington State, meanwhile, holds down the highest position of any Pac-12 team, even if the cross-state rival it so adores, Washington (7-3), did just pull off a rankings curiosity. As evidence of the difficulty some voters are having filling out 25-strong rankings this year, the Huskies moved from No. 25 to No. 18 while idle this past weekend. Washington State and Washington will play each other at Washington State on Nov. 23.", "President Trump speaks during a Diwali ceremonial lighting of the Diya event on Nov. 13 at the White House. (Joshua Roberts/Bloomberg News)\n\nPresident Trump is leaning in favor of backing a measure that would reform U.S. sentencing laws \u2014 a compromise drafted by the Senate that marks a significant overhaul of the criminal justice system by easing some mandatory minimum sentences for drug-related and other crimes.\n\nBut Trump did not commit one way or the other on the pending legislation, which he was briefed on Tuesday by senior White House adviser Jared Kushner, his son-in-law, who has taken on criminal justice reform as one of his core issues.\n\nThat meeting at the White House was described by two people with knowledge of it. One person said Trump is a \u201csoft yes\u201d on the bill, but signaled that he wants more law enforcement groups to publicly support the measure.\n\n\u201cThis is not a 100 percent done deal,\u201d according to the second person briefed on the short meeting. No lawmakers attended, but White House officials later briefed congressional leadership.\n\nKushner is pressing Trump to offer formal support of the bill this week, according to a White House official. The White House has organized a criminal justice reform event for 4:30 p.m. Wednesday, according to two congressional officials, although it was still unclear whether Trump will explicitly endorse the legislation.\n\nThe criminal justice overhaul, scaled back from its initial ambitious Senate draft but vastly more comprehensive than legislation the House passed this year, could be one of the most significant and bipartisan laws signed by Trump in his first two years in office.\n\nOpponents of the overhaul push lost a high-ranking ally when Jeff Sessions, who opposed any initiative to relax sentencing laws, resigned as attorney general last week.\n\n\u201cI talked to the president last night,\u201d Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), a vocal supporter of the sentencing measure who has Trump\u2019s ear, said Tuesday evening. \u201cI\u2019ve never been more optimistic than I am now, but we\u2019re not there yet. . . . He seemed supportive last night.\u201d\n\nThe compromise criminal justice measure, which was hammered out in principle this summer, adds four provisions to a House-passed bill that focused on reducing prisoner recidivism and did not include the more controversial sentencing changes.\n\nThe new Senate package includes language that lowers mandatory minimum sentences for drug felonies, including reducing the \u201cthree-strike\u201d penalty from life behind bars to 25 years. That provision would not be allowed to take place retroactively, a major concession from Democrats.\n\nIt also would include Senate language that retroactively applies the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, which reduces the disparity in sentencing guidelines between crack and powder cocaine offenses. And it would reduce mandatory minimum sentences that go into effect when a firearm is used during a violent crime or drug offense. The latter also would not apply to people already sentenced for these crimes.\n\nThe agreement also lets judges take advantage of \u201csafety valves\u201d \u2014 which allow them to issue sentences shorter than mandatory minimums for low-level crimes \u2014 in more types of cases.\n\nOne new addition since the August negotiations is language that would bar prisoners who had been convicted of certain fentanyl offenses \u2014 primarily those that involved five- and 10-year mandatory minimums \u2014 from being able to receive credit for time served, according to two officials familiar with the discussions.\n\nThe addition is significant because Trump told Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), a close ally and avowed opponent of the emerging criminal justice measure, that he disagrees with allowing early prison release for fentanyl dealers, and the tentative agreement could have done so. Another section of the earlier measure could have allowed fentanyl dealers to earn time credits.\n\nThose revisions prompted the Fraternal Order of Police to endorse the compromise, calling it a bill that will \u201cmake our streets and neighborhoods safer,\u201d better protect police officers and \u201cimprove the ability of our criminal justice system to effectively rehabilitate offenders.\u201d\n\nFurther giving advocates hope, the National Sheriffs\u2019 Association \u2014 which has opposed previous versions of the sentencing measure \u2014 has been quiet on the compromise.\n\nIn the White House meeting Tuesday, Trump was pleased that so many different law enforcement groups had signed on to support it, according to one of those briefed on the meeting. But Trump reservations because many conservatives lawmakers remain opposed, advisers said.\n\n\u201cHe is really concerned he\u2019s going to be seen as soft on crime,\u201d one person said. \u201cHe really cares that law enforcement supports him politically.\u201d\n\nThe individuals spoke on the condition of anonymity to freely discuss private conversations.\n\nSeveral people involved in the negotiations cautioned Tuesday that the emerging agreement needs an explicit endorsement from Trump to proceed. Supporters of the bill would begin gauging support for the bill later this week, officials said, if Trump signs off on the measure.\n\n\u201cSince those are negotiations that are going on, I can\u2019t comment on anything until we get a final product and get some word from the White House,\u201d Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), one of the bill\u2019s chief authors, said Tuesday.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who has been quiet on the merits of the legislation, appears unlikely to take the lead in formally rounding up support, however. And some liberal Democrats may not ultimately endorse the compromise product, fearing they have conceded too much to the right on the sentencing changes.\n\n\u201cI have not signed off on it,\u201d said Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), a prominent Democratic supporter of the initial, more wide-ranging Senate legislation. \u201cI\u2019m still dealing with the details.\u201d", "FILE - In this Dec. 10, 2007 file photo, retired Army Gen.

Well, North Korea is also in no rush. After Mr. Trump\u2019s showy June summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore, Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear materials production, missile operating sites and brutal concentration camps are all still grinding along.\n\nIt is true that North Korea has not tested a missile or an atomic bomb lately. But nor has it been idle. In a report published on Monday, Beyond Parallel, a project of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, documented with satellite imagery 13 North Korean missile operating bases, and perhaps as many as 20, that have been undeclared by the government. The disclosure is another reminder that North Korea has rebuffed the U.S. demand for a complete inventory of its nuclear weapons programs, while insisting the United States make a full declaration of the end of the 1950-1953 Korean War. Mr. Kim is a wily negotiator. In September, he pledged to \u201cpermanently dismantle\u201d a missile engine test site, a mere fraction of the missile and nuclear weapons complex that is still running at full steam, including the newly disclosed sites, such as Sakkanmol, which handles short-range missiles and is located about 50 miles north of the demilitarized zone.\n\nSince the summit, Mr. Trump has swooned in unseemly fashion that \u201cwe fell in love\u201d when Mr. Kim wrote to him: \u201cNo, really \u2014 he wrote me beautiful letters, and they\u2019re great letters.\u201d In fact, while Mr. Kim has focused on a rapprochement with President Moon Jae-in of South Korea, the Trump approach to slowing North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons systems appears to be at an impasse. A meeting scheduled for Nov. 8 between North Korean officials and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo fell apart. Mr. Kim, like his father, is well versed in the tools of deception, delay, threat and extortion. He is proving it once again, to the detriment of Mr. Trump \u2014 and global security.\n\nMeanwhile, the human rights catastrophe in North Korea is unaddressed. Four years ago, a United Nations commission of inquiry found \u201csystematic, widespread and gross human rights violations\u201d by North Korea, including \u201ccrimes against humanity\u201d perpetrated by the state. Now, the U.N. special rapporteur on North Korea, Tomas Ojea Quintana, said, \u201cThe human rights situation at the moment has not changed on the ground in North Korea despite the important progress on security, peace and prosperity.\u201d He added, \u201cWhat is needed from North Korea is a signal that they will discuss human rights . . . . We haven\u2019t heard anything coming from the summits in this respect.\u201d\n\nA few years ago, the world was shocked to discover North Korea had one, then six, nuclear weapons. The number is now probably in the dozens. Tens of thousands of people are suffering in brutal prison camps. But who\u2019s in a rush?", "COLOMBO, Sri Lanka \u2014 Sri Lanka\u2019s Parliament passed a no-confidence vote against the government headed by the hastily sworn-in and bitterly disputed Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, as lawmakers convened Wednesday for the first time since the president dismissed his Cabinet and suspended the legislature last month.\n\nThe motion brought by the head of an opposition party could mean that Rajapaksa will have to resign his post but does not necessarily mean the leader whose ousting set off the crisis will be reinstated, creating a power vacuum in the South Asian island nation.\n\n\u201cRajapaksa\u2019s government will fall,\u201d said Paikiasothy Sarvanamuttu, executive director of the Colombo-based nonpartisan Centre for Policy Alternatives civil society group, and among the petitioners who challenged the constitutionality of President Maithripala Sirisena\u2019s recent actions.\n\nSarvanamuttu said the no-confidence vote leaves Sirisena with two options \u2014 either to reinstate Ranil Wickremesinghe, whom he replaced with Rajapaksa on Oct. 26, as prime minister, or await the decision of the Supreme Court, which is due to issue a ruling on the ouster and subsequent government appointments on Dec. 7.\n\nLawmakers supporting Wickremesinghe had a visible majority in the chamber on Wednesday, with many wearing shawls emblazoned with the words \u201cFor democracy.\u201d\n\nAs Speaker of Parliament Karu Jayasuriya prepared to let the no-confidence motion be debated, the chamber descended into chaos, with lawmakers supporting Rajapaksa filing into the center of the room shouting political slogans and accusing Jayasuriya of betraying the people\u2019s mandate.\n\nJayasuriya then said he had no choice but to bypass the debate and take an oral vote, with those in favor clearly voicing more support for the motion than those against it.\n\nBefore the results were announced, Rajapaksa walked out of the chamber.\n\nAfter it became clear last week that Rajapaksa would not survive a no-confidence motion, Sirisena dissolved Parliament, but the Supreme Court on Tuesday had ordered the legislature to keep working until next month.\n\nNamal Rajapaksa, a lawmaker in his father\u2019s United People Freedom Alliance party, told The Associated Press that they \u201cdon\u2019t accept this verdict\u201d and will continue as the government.\n\nRajapaksa supporters outside Parliament shouted: \u201cWe need a government!\u201d\n\nParliament adjourned after the vote and is to reconvene Thursday morning.\n\nSri Lanka\u2019s Supreme Court on Tuesday suspended Sirisena\u2019s order to dissolve Parliament and hold new elections.\n\nWickremesinghe, who has been holed up at the prime minister\u2019s official residence in Colombo since his ouster, said at a news conference after the vote that he and his supporters \u201chave proved that there is a purported administration which does not enjoy the support of Parliament. And therefore it\u2019s illegal.\u201d\n\nHe said that police and civil servants should cease carrying out orders from the Rajapaksa-led government.\n\nLate Tuesday, Sirisena held a meeting of the Security Council, including the military commander, police chief and defense secretary.

Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) from becoming speaker.\n\nThe Democratic dissidents are so far nowhere near as well organized as the House Freedom Caucus, the roughly three dozen conservative hard-liners who frustrated the GOP leadership and blocked legislation, but they are threatening to use similar tactics.\n\nPelosi\u2019s opponents are threatening to withhold their votes on the House floor even after an anticipated party vote nominating her as the next speaker. That is a page straight out of the Freedom Caucus playbook \u2014 used to deny Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (Calif.) the speakership in 2015.\n\n[Pelosi moves aggressively to snuff out challenge to her bid for House speaker]\n\nTop Democrats are warning rank-and-file members not to go down that road, underscoring a growing backlash to the anti-\n\nPelosi faction.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll ask everybody to take a look at the so-called Freedom Caucus and see where they got the Republican Party,\u201d Assistant Democratic Leader James E. Clyburn (D-S.C.) said Tuesday. \u201cI think they\u2019re the ones that got them into the shape they\u2019re in now.\u201d\n\nThe warnings come barely a week after Democrats won a sweeping victory in the midterm elections that put them in position to elect a speaker and claim committee gavels in January for the first time since 2007. While votes are still being counted, Democrats are on track to win anywhere from 35 to 40 seats \u2014 their biggest single pickup since the post-\n\nWatergate election of 1974.\n\nMany Democrats credit Pelosi, 78, whose hefty fundraising and disciplined message on health care propelled the party to victory.\n\n\u201cNancy Pelosi has proven herself as a first-rate legislator,\u201d said Rep.-elect Donna Shalala (D-Fla.), the former health and human services secretary. \u201cWe would not have Obamacare without her.\u201d\n\nBut with greater power comes greater tension inside the caucus. Not only are a handful of Democratic incumbents insisting on new leadership despite the electoral gains, several of the incoming lawmakers say they won\u2019t back down from campaign promises to install a new speaker.\n\nIn 2016, dozens of House Democrats opposed Pelosi in an internal party vote only to vote for her on the floor. Around a dozen Democrats set to vote this time around \u2014 with the speakership actually at stake \u2014 say they won\u2019t fall in line.\n\nRep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.), a leader of the anti-Pelosi faction, rejected the GOP comparisons. \"The Freedom Caucus is trying to break government,\" he said. \"We're just trying to get new leadership.\"\n\nA critical test may come later this week as Democrats consider an internal rule change to raise the threshold vote for nominating a speaker candidate from a simple majority to 218 votes. The change is expected to fail, in a boost for Pelosi.\n\nIn 2015, the Freedom Caucus played a key role in forcing out Republican Speaker John A. Boehner (Ohio) by threatening to call a vote on his removal. Rather than put vulnerable lawmakers in a difficult spot, Boehner quit.\n\nMcCarthy, as the No. 2 leader, was the obvious heir apparent, but conservative hard-liners saw him as too much like Boehner \u2014 an establishment-minded operator without a strong interest in conservative policy. So they coalesced behind a stalking horse, Rep. Daniel Webster (Fla.), and promised as a bloc to stick with him \u2014 thus denying McCarthy the absolute majority he would need on the House floor.\n\nLess than 24 hours later, McCarthy withdrew his speaker bid, and the Freedom Caucus was emboldened to make demand after demand under the compromise choice, Paul D. Ryan (Wis.).\n\n\u201cDifferent principles, but in terms of the tactics . . . you can really make a difference,\u201d said Rep. Warren Davidson (Ohio), a Freedom Caucus member who saw a resemblance between his group and the anti-Pelosi faction.\n\nThe Democrats who are plotting against Pelosi base their objections almost entirely on politics, not ideology or policy.\n\n[Pelosi\u2019s Democratic opponents scramble to organize the resistance]\n\nWhere the conservatives wanted their leaders to adopt tough positions on issues such as immigration and government spending, the Democrats mainly want Pelosi to move on, fearing she is a drag on candidates in competitive districts. Meanwhile, longtime incumbents are eager to move up the leadership ladder.\n\n\u201cPeople can compare it any way they want to,\u201d said Rep. Filemon Vela (D-Tex.). \u201cWe\u2019re a committed group, and we\u2019re working together, and I\u2019m 100 percent confident we\u2019ve got the votes to start the next cycle with a new leader.\u201d\n\nBut to Pelosi\u2019s supporters \u2014 and to those who may not count themselves as loyalists but also don\u2019t want to see a schism \u2014 there is little tolerance for splinter factions of any sort.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re in the majority, you have the responsibility to have a plan,\u201d said Rep. Dan Kildee (D-Mich.). \u201cWhat I don\u2019t want is to have our caucus so conditioned to the way a minority party functions that we don\u2019t really think about the consequences of all the choices we make.\u201d\n\nClyburn, who is in a contested race for House majority whip, said he would \u201cresist anything that would be destructive to our caucus\u201d \u2014 including a potential floor fight over the speakership.\n\n\u201cThe American people restored House Democrats to the majority; they didn\u2019t restore that for us to go out on a tangent, for us to go out on ego trips,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a boost for the current leadership, 155 Democrats, including newly elected members, signed a letter Tuesday endorsing Democratic Whip Steny H. Hoyer (Md.) to be the next majority leader. \u201cWe will need a steady, experienced leader over the next two years, who also works to empower our Members and prepare them for future leadership opportunities,\u201d they said of Hoyer.\n\nSmall groups of legislators using their leverage is nothing new, of course \u2014 especially to Pelosi, who dealt with several ad hoc groups that formed to shape major pieces of legislation the Democrats moved in 2009 and 2010, when the party controlled the House, Senate and presidency.\n\nBut none emerged as a persistent thorn in the side of the broader caucus in the way that the Freedom Caucus has for Republicans. And Democrats are happy to keep it that way.\n\nIn the days since the Democrats\u2019 sweeping victory, lawmakers and liberal groups have spoken up in praise of Pelosi \u2014 her legislative skills, her fundraising acumen and her groundbreaking status as the first female speaker \u2014 but a few have added sharp warnings against internal divisions.\n\nIn a letter to Democratic colleagues Monday, Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (Md.), who is expected to be named chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, cautioned against \u201ca self-destructive leadership battle\u201d that would \u201conly play into the hands of House Republicans and President Trump.\u201d The winner of the party vote, he said, ought to be elected speaker on the floor in January.\n\n\u201cOur new members promised their constituents to bring stability and common-sense to a dysfunctional Washington \u2014 not to be drawn into an effort to throw the House into chaos,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe party\u2019s left wing, traditionally organized around the Congressional Progressive Caucus, is getting an infusion of young new members, including high-profile Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-\n\nCortez (N.Y.), who are angling to take a more active role \u2014 one that some have suggested could resemble a left-wing Freedom Caucus.\n\nOcasio-Cortez, who floated the idea of a smaller, more resilient progressive caucus \u201cof 10 or 30 people\u201d in an interview this summer, has not talked much about it since then.

(Jacquelyn Martin/AP)\n\nThe Russian government is arguing that a federal court should dismiss a lawsuit brought by the Democratic National Committee alleging that Moscow\u2019s military spies, the Trump campaign and the WikiLeaks organization conspired to disrupt the 2016 campaign and tilt the election to Donald Trump.\n\n[Democratic Party sues Russia, Trump campaign and WikiLeaks alleging 2016 campaign conspiracy]\n\nIn a letter and statement this month to the State Department and a judge in the Southern District of New York, Russia\u2019s Ministry of Justice argued that the United States\u2019 Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act protects the Russian government from such lawsuits.\n\nIn particular, the lawsuit\u2019s naming of the GRU military spy agency as a defendant takes the litigation out of bounds on the basis that \u201cany alleged \u2018military attack\u2019 is a quintessential sovereign act,\u201d said a Nov. 6 statement by the ministry\u2019s Department for International Law and Cooperation.\n\nThe Russian government also warned that if the suit is allowed to proceed, it exposes American spy services such as the National Security Agency \u2014 an arm of the Defense Department \u2014 to \u201ca tidal wave of civil litigation\u201d in foreign courts.\n\nThe statement cited a former senior Justice Department official, Jack Goldsmith, who said \u201cthe U.S. intelligence services break into computers and computer networks abroad at an astounding rate, certainly on a greater scale than any other intelligence service in the world.\u201d\n\nMoreover, the Russians argued that the allegations raised by the DNC were a \u201cpolitical question\u201d best handled on a \u201cstate-to-state\u201d basis by the Trump administration and the U.S. Congress.\n\n[Read Russia\u2019s letter arguing that the DNC lawsuit be dismissed]\n\nMoscow\u2019s statement \u2014 the first substantive response to the DNC lawsuit filed in May \u2014 comes as special counsel Robert S.

In July, Mueller obtained an indictment of 12 GRU officers, laying out in detail how various operatives allegedly hacked Democratic emails and transferred them to WikiLeaks, often using GRU intermediaries.\n\nIf the DNC case is allowed to proceed, the Democrats will seek internal documents and testimony from the Trump campaign that might illuminate interactions with Russia. They are asking for damages that they expect amount to several million dollars to compensate for alleged harm to the DNC\u2019s campaign operations, employees and fundraising activities.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump has an easy choice to make: defend our democracy or do Putin\u2019s bidding,\u201d DNC Chairman Tom Perez said in a statement, referring to Russian president Vladi\u00admir Putin. \u201cThe Trump Administration should stand up for the American people by telling Putin that the American judiciary has the jurisdiction and power to hold foreign governments that attack our people accountable for the harm they cause.\u201d\n\nIn a September communication to the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs asked the U.S. government to \u201ctake immediate action to stop\u201d the lawsuit, nudging the State Department to weigh in on Russia\u2019s behalf.\n\n[Read Russia\u2019s memo to the U.S. Embassy in Moscow]\n\nThe State Department said it needed time to review the matter before it could comment.\n\nThe Democrats are among a potentially growing class of plaintiffs seeking to sue foreign governments for alleged hacking-related crimes. The bar for such litigation is high, however, because of the 1976 law, which generally forbids lawsuits against foreign states.\n\nThe DNC, however, has argued that it can sue the Russian government because, the committee alleged, its agents stole \u201ctrade secrets, a form of commercial activity\u201d and the hack was a \u201ctortious act\u201d committed in the United States.\n\nMoscow argued that the commercial-activity exception does not apply to \u201can alleged military attack by a \u2018military intelligence agency,\u2019 \u201d and that a tort case cannot be recast as a commercial-activity case.\n\n\u201cRussia certainly has a credible argument for dismissal,\u201d said Scott Anderson, a former lawyer in the State Department\u2019s office of the legal adviser and now a fellow at the Brookings Institution. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say it\u2019s a strong one.

President Donald Trump has soured on Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and she is expected to leave her job as soon as this week. That\u2019s according to two people who spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity. (Evan Vucci/Associated Press)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump is weighing an administration-wide shakeup as he looks to prepare his White House for divided government, but it is unclear who is going and who is staying.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen was thought to be out as soon as this week, according to two people with knowledge of the issue, but she is now likely to remain in the post for a longer period because there is no obvious successor in place.\n\nTrump has soured on Nielsen and White House chief of staff John Kelly, in part over frustration that his administration is not doing more to address what he has called a crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border, according to the people. But the scope of the contemplated changes is far broader, as Trump gears up for a wave of Democratic oversight requests and to devote more effort to his own re-election campaign.\n\nAccording to people familiar with the situation, Trump is also discussing replacing Kelly with Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s chief of staff, Nick Ayers. Kelly, a retired Marine general, has been credited with bringing order and process to a chaotic West Wing, but he has fallen out of favor with the president as well as presidential daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n\nAyers, a seasoned campaign operative, would restore a political-mindset to the role, but he faces stiff opposition from some corners of the West Wing, with some aides lobbying Trump directly against the move.\n\nOther changes are afoot, as Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke are being discussed for replacement. And in an extraordinary move Tuesday, first lady Melania Trump\u2019s office called publicly for the firing of Trump\u2019s deputy national security adviser, Mira Ricardel.\n\nFor all of the talk of churn, Trump often expresses frustration with aides and then does not take action. Talk of Kelly\u2019s exit has percolated for months and he remains in place.\n\nNielsen had hoped to complete one year in the job and leave in December, but it appeared unlikely she would last that long, said two sources. Both people who had knowledge of the debate spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nCurbing illegal immigration is Trump\u2019s signature issue \u2014 and one he returns to as a way to rally his most loyal supporters.\n\nBut anyone who takes over at Homeland Security is likely to run up against the same problems that Nielsen faced. The administration has already tried to clamp down at the border but those efforts have been largely thwarted or watered down due to legal challenges.\n\nTrump also told allies that he never fully trusted Nielsen, whom he associated with President George W. Bush, a longtime foe. And he told those close to him that he felt, at times, that her loyalty was more toward her longtime mentor \u2014 Kelly \u2014 than to the president.\n\nZinke, who faces several ethics investigations, said in interview with The Associated Press on Monday that he has spoken in recent days with Trump, Pence and Kelly about probes into his leadership and they remain supportive. He denied any wrongdoing.\n\nRoss addressed turnover rumors at a Yahoo! Finance summit Tuesday, saying he was in the post to give back to the country and support Trump.\n\n\u201cI worked very hard to get President Trump elected,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I\u2019d like to work equally hard to have him succeed and be re-elected.\u201d\n\nQuestions about Nielsen\u2019s job security are not new. Earlier this year, she pushed back on a New York Times report that she drafted a resignation letter but did not submit it, after Trump scolded her at a Cabinet meeting.\n\nNielsen has led the sprawling post-9/11 federal agency since December. She had been chief of staff to Kelly when he was Trump\u2019s first Homeland Security secretary. A DHS spokesman would not comment on whether she was leaving.\n\n\u201cThe secretary is honored to lead the men and women of DHS and is committed to implementing the president\u2019s security-focused agenda to protect Americans from all threats and will continue to do so,\u201d spokesman Tyler Houlton said.\n\nNielsen advocated for strong cybersecurity defense, and often said she believed the next terror major attack would occur online \u2014 not by planes or bombs. She was tasked with helping states secure elections following interference by Russians during the 2016 election.\n\nShe pushed Trump\u2019s immigration policies, including funding for his border wall and defended the administration\u2019s practice of separating children from parents, telling a Senate committee that removing children from parents facing criminal charges happens \u201cin the United States every day.\u201d But she was also instrumental in stopping the separations.\n\nJust last week, the administration announced that migrants would be denied asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border if they crossed illegally, creating regulations that circumvent immigration laws stating anyone can claim asylum no matter how they arrive to the country. The decision would affect about 70,000 people annually and was immediately challenged by the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nNielsen also moved to abandon longstanding regulations that dictate how long children are allowed to be held in immigration detention, and requested bed space from the U.S. military for some 12,000 people in an effort to detain all families who cross the border. Right now there is space for about 3,000 families and they are at capacity.\n\nShe got into heated discussions with Trump and White House aides several times over immigration policy, as she sought to explain the complicated legal challenges behind immigration law and pushed for a more diplomatic approach.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear who would replace her. The job requires Senate confirmation and there is no deputy secretary. Under Secretary for Management Claire Grady would be the acting head if Nielsen left.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press Writers Darlene Superville in Washington and Jonathan Lemire in New York contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Yohn and other abuse survivors are protesting at Catholic bishops' meeting in Baltimore on Tuesday. (Katherine Frey/The Washington Post)\n\nBALTIMORE -- The Vatican may have thrown into disarray American bishops' plans to vote this week on proposals to address the Catholic Church\u2019s sexual abuse crisis. But on Tuesday it became clear that the bishops are far from united in their views about what actions to take, as well as their own culpability and the perceived role of homosexuality in the unfolding scandal.\n\nIn their first of two days of debate about the abuse proposals on Tuesday, many bishops advocated vigorously for empowering lay people to investigate and hold bishops to a new written standard of conduct \u2014 while others questioned the pitfalls of such investigations and some expressed skepticism about the necessity of holding the church\u2019s leaders more accountable at all.\n\nBishop Robert Evans of Providence came to the microphone to defend the actions of bishops in past decades who returned abusive priests to ministry, acting on the advice of psychologists at the time. \u201cMany bishops, I would say almost everyone, did the best they could according to the best lights of the time.\u201d\n\nHis statement, which was met with significant applause, contrasted starkly with remarks made at the conference by the chairman of the National Review Board, a lay-led body the bishops set up in 2002 to monitor how well the U.S. church is doing on the abuse issue.\n\nFrancesco Cesareo strongly objected to every suggestion that the bishops can do anything less than take massive action. More than 130 current bishops, \u201chave been accused during their careers of failing to respond to sexual misconduct in their dioceses,\u201d Cesareo said referencing investigations by the Boston Globe and the Philadelphia Inquirer. \u201cOthers have been accused of committing abuse. Few have faced real consequences. This must change.\u201d\n\n[Vatican tells U.S. bishops not to vote on proposals to tackle sexual abuse, spurns outside investigations]\n\nA major proposal of the bishops, to be funded with $500,000 from the dioceses, would create a commission to investigate misconduct by bishops \u2014 including three clergy and six non-clergy members, at least one of whom would be a religious sister and at least one of whom would be an abuse victim. Participation by the bishops in investigations would be voluntary, and the commission could only access evidence held by a bishop or his diocese if the bishop consents to it, Archbishop Allen Vigneron of Detroit told the conference.\n\nSome bishops raised concerns about the plan, which they had been scheduled to vote on this week. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to say some of us have our share of enemies out there, that an allegation could be brought forward that is motivated by something other than the truth,\u201d Archbishop Alexander Sample of Portland, Ore. said.\n\nAnother proposal that had been scheduled for a vote is a new code of conduct for the bishops, which some bishops bristled at, saying they\u2019d signed up to adhere to a standard of conduct, including celibacy, when they became priests.\n\nOthers fretted about the prospect of telephone and online hotlines for reporting bishop misconduct, which the bishops have begun searching for a third-party vendor to operate. The company that takes the calls can report the complaints to law enforcement directly. If a lay commission is set up, the hotline could also funnel the complaints to that commission.\n\nBishop Nicholas DiMarzio of Brooklyn and Archbishop Salvatore Cordileone of San Francisco stood up to ask how the hotline will handle anonymous complaints.\n\n\u201cSooner or later they need to disclose their identity. An anonymous complaint is not going to go anywhere, I think,\u201d Los Angeles Archbishop Jose Gomez, the vice president of the U.S. bishops, responded.\n\nEven if the caller is named, Bishop Donald Trautman, a retired leader of Erie, Pa., said he still opposes the hotline. \u201cI think this proposal is very dangerous and unjust,\u201d he said. He said he does not want accusations that have not been \u201cproven\u201d or \u201csubstantiated\u201d reported to the apostolic nuncio, the Vatican\u2019s ambassador in Washington.\n\nTrautman, whose former diocese was one of the six investigated in the Pennsylvania grand jury report that drew new attention to sexual abuse in the church, established himself at the meeting as one of the loudest voices against further accountability measures of several sorts. Earlier in the day, after some praised state prosecutors and secular journalists who expose crimes committed by priests, Trautman went to the microphone to castigate both.\n\n\u201cWe should not be so naive as to accept every government report, every attorney general report as completely accurate or honest,\u201d he said. Then he said he wouldn\u2019t trust either the Philadelphia Inquirer or the Boston Globe \u2014 who recently published a joint investigation into bishops' record on covering up sexual abuse \u2014 to publish accurate information. Some of the bishops applauded.\n\nThe Vatican\u2019s Congregation of Bishops gave the American bishops an unexpected directive just as their meeting began on Monday, telling them not to take a formal vote on any of their sexual abuse proposals. The exact words used by the Vatican\u2019s Congregation of Bishops in telling the Americans not to vote weren\u2019t known Tuesday, but U.S. bishops' conference president Cardinal Daniel DiNardo said the halt was aimed at keeping unity in the global church on procedures.\n\nJohn L. Allen Jr., editor of the Catholic site Crux, said there is a divide between the Vatican and the U.S. bishops about authority. Under church law, the only superior of a bishop is the pope, and anything otherwise \u201cthat would look like the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops trying to assert authority over another bishop would be a problem,\u201d Allen said. \u201cAnything that looks like a lay board, or a lay entity that would assert authority over bishops would also be a problem.\u201d\n\n[The 2018 Catholic clergy sex abuse crisis brings new energy \u2014 and anti-gay activists \u2014 into the survivors' movement]\n\nOutside advisory boards offered strong words for the bishops as they contemplated their plans.\n\n\u201cIt remains clear that some bishops have escaped the consequences of their acts of omission regarding abuse and that little is being done to address this injustice,\u201d Cesareo of the National Review Board said. He called for an investigation into allegations by Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigan\u00f2, the former papal nuncio to the United States, that Pope Francis and others in the Vatican long knew of the allegations against McCarrick and declined to act.\n\nCesareo criticized the bishops for hiding the extent of the abuse until civil authorities and journalists intervened. \u201cHow many souls have been lost because of this crisis?\u201d he said. \u201cToday the faithful and the clergy do not trust many of you. They are angry and frustrated, no longer satisfied with words and even with prayer. They seek action that signals a cultural change from the leadership of the church.\u201d\n\nThe board presented the bishops with a list of recommendations, including one urging every diocese to review its archives, dating back to at least 1950, and to make the record of abuse found in those archives public.\n\nRetired Army Col. Anita Raines, of the Conference\u2019s National Advisory Council, said the council wants a code of conduct for bishops and a public recommitment to chastity and holiness. It also wants a third-party system to receive reports of abuse and auditing of U.S. seminaries \u201cto investigate possible patterns of abuse of power and predatory homosexual behavior,\u201d she said.\n\nThe explosive topic of homosexuality arose late Tuesday, with some bishops taking the microphone on the issue.\n\nBishop Joseph Strickland, of Tyler, Texas, said the McCarrick scandal should lead the bishops to consider the question of gay clergy. \u201cIt\u2019s part of our deposit of faith that we believe homosexual activity is immoral,\u201d he said. \u201cDo we believe the doctrine of the Church or not?\u201d", "A D.C. man who described himself as a white nationalist to law enforcement officers and became a social-media follower of the suspect in the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting has been arrested on a gun charge after his worried relatives contacted the authorities, according to federal court filings.\n\nJeffrey R.

(Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP)\n\nA vision of the Democratic Party's future unfolded Tuesday morning in the offices of House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi. While new members of Congress were heading to orientation, 150 protesters demanded action on a \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d that would transition the country off fossil fuels. Before they were done, New York's Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez arrived, trailed by cameras, urging them to keep pressuring the leader of her party.\n\n\u201cThis is not about me,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez, the biggest star in a class of new left-wing Democrats, said to reporters and activists with the Sunshine Movement, an environmental advocacy group. \u201cShould Leader Pelosi become the next speaker of the House, we need to tell her that we\u2019ve got her back in showing and pursuing the most progressive energy agenda that this country has ever seen.\u201d\n\nThe protest, months in the making, was a preview of how the energized left planned to interact with a reviving Democratic Party. It wasn\u2019t taking power for granted. It was going to apply pressure, whenever it could, with the media watching.\n\nThe 2018 elections gave relief and some bragging rights to traditional Democratic power brokers such as labor unions, civil rights groups and abortions rights groups. They also tested the groups that had burst onto the scene during the 2016 Democratic presidential primary, such as the Sunrise Movement and the groups founded after the 2016 election \u2014 Indivisible, SwingLeft, Women's March and more, all of them having mobilized to stop the repeal of the Affordable Care Act and terminate the GOP\u2019s House majority.\n\nOrganizations that existed on the fringes of the party or didn't exist at all woke up last Wednesday with an army of voter contacts and close, friendly ties with the people who may run for president in 2020.\n\n\u201cWe succeeded in our original mission to take back the House, and we've found that our momentum is still growing,\u201d said Ethan Todras-Whitehill, executive director of SwingLeft, a group founded less than two years ago that raised $10 million to target House races.\n\nThis dynamic isn't new; in fact, it's becoming our new normal. In 2011, the tea party movement and the conservative groups it empowered, such as FreedomWorks and Americans for Prosperity, shaped the conversation around the Republican congressional agenda and the presidential primary. In 2013, the same groups, supplemented by Heritage Action, pressured House and Senate conservatives to shut down the government in an attempt to stop the Affordable Care Act from being implemented.\n\nIn Congress, this strategy led to an austerity budget deal (abandoned when Republicans took power last year) and to some cuts to the ACA. In both the 2012 and 2016 elections, it reshaped the Republican Party, transforming Mitt Romney from a moderate whose own health-care plan formed the basis for the ACA to a candidate who'd unwind it and sidelining \u201cestablishment\u201d Republicans for an eventual 2016 showdown between Donald Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas.\n\nDemocrats say that their liberal base and institutions won't be as sharp-edged as the right's. At a Monday news conference with new members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, CPC co-chair Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Wis.) rejected any comparison between the 90-odd liberals in that caucus and the conservative House Freedom Caucus. Indeed, even the Tuesday protest of Pelosi's office led to the Democratic leader reaffirming that she wanted to relaunch a special climate committee.\n\n\u201cThey like to say no, and we like to say yes,\u201d Pocan said, referring to the HFC.\n\nThe primary electorate in 2020 might ask for more from Democrats. There are chapters of Indivisible, Women's March and Democratic Socialists of America that were not even founded until 2017. When ambitious Democrats traveled to early states in the midterms, they were asked to take bold stands and often did so. It was outside the liberal Netroots Nation conference that Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said that the criminal justice system was \u201cracist, top to bottom.\u201d It was at a conference organized by Indivisible and the Working Families Party that Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), once seen as a Wall Street-friendly senator, agreed to endorse a new financial transactions tax.\n\nIn 2019, liberal groups expect to draft ambitious Democrats into many more policy fights. Moms Demand Action and other fast-growing gun-safety groups can come to Democrats with evidence from last week that candidates who cross the NRA can win statewide in the Midwest and Southwest. Indivisible, which ended the election with more than 6,000 chapters, will announce later today that it is reorienting to pass liberal bills in state legislatures. Nevada, which Democrats will control top to bottom next year, will debate ideas such as universal Medicaid; Democrats who want to be president will be in the state, hunting for support and seeing where the party's base is moving.\n\nThe labor movement will be making asks, too. No Democrat looking at the presidency has the same institutional labor support that Hillary Clinton had in 2015; union support will be up for grabs. In January, the AFL-CIO will hold a Martin Luther King Jr. activism summit that potential Democratic presidential candidates are expected to attend. Labor projects from the last cycle, such as the SEIU's \u201cFight for $15\" minimum wage campaign, are working to bring the party's entire presidential bench on board.\n\n\u201cWorkers in the Fight for $15 are going to keep knocking on doors, organizing their communities, and going on strike to make a powerful demand for $15 an hour and union rights that no candidate will be able to ignore,\u201d said Allynn Umel, the group\u2019s organizing director.\n\nSome of the new liberal groups will stay involved without dictating terms to Democrats. SwingLeft's leaders said that while they were expanding their ambitions for 2020, they did not expect to make demands on Democratic presidential primary candidates.\n\n\u201cOne of the ways we feel we were most helpful [in 2018] was in organizing early, but for the general election, so that there were resources there for the eventual nominee,\u201d Todras-Whitehill said.\n\nThat position makes SwingLeft into a kind of outlier. As conservative forces inside the Democratic Party have faded, the left has grown more organized. Within hours of Tuesday's protest, HuffPost published polling data that suggested a \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d could be a winner for Democrats; Data for Progress, a small left-wing think tank, splashed similar data across Twitter. Fears of a Democratic \u201ccivil war\u201d were overblown in 2018, but with the election over, the party\u2019s left has more opportunities, and pressure points, than the center that had taken credit for the wins.\n\nON THE TRAIL\n\nRichard Ojeda watches election results in Yuma, near Logan, W.Va., on Nov. 6. (Dylan Vidovich/Logan Banner/AP)\n\nPlenty of people are going to run for president in 2020. One goal of this newsletter will be to talk to all of them, and we're off to a good start: West Virginia State Sen. Richard Ojeda, who announced his presidential bid just five days after losing a House race, spoke to us Monday morning.\n\nOjeda, a former Army Ranger who made his first run for office in 2016, built an enormous national following in a race that looked \u2014 and, eventually, was \u2014 not winnable for a Democrat in 2018. Having voted for Donald Trump in 2016, he ran as a critic of the president's economic agenda and of both parties' leadership in Washington. What follows is a transcript of our conversation, lightly edited for brevity.\n\nWashington Post: You've been in this for around 24 hours. What's the response been so far?\n\nRichard Ojeda: It's amazing. We're getting responses from all over the United States of America, and for the most part they're very positive.\n\nWP: So is no one asking: Hey, you just lost a House race, why should we hand you the keys?\n\nRO: Because we improved by 36 to 37 points over what Democrats were getting in this district. I am the person who can get people who voted for Trump to come over, because I relate to them. The majority of people who'd throw their hat into this ring are cookie-cutter politicians. Many of them will be very wealthy. And I'm sorry, the majority of people are starting to realize that those people don't relate to them. Those people have no concept of what life is like for them, what life is like for the parent just trying to put food on the table.\n\nWP: What's your plan to keep the coal industry alive if you win?\n\nRO: I'm not going to lie to coal miners. Coal mining will never ever be the way that it used to be. I believe there is a need for metallurgical coal, to rebuild our infrastructure and our military might, but coal is not going to be something that can sustain people, and that will come sooner than later. We need to be honest in areas that rely on coal, so we can transition those coal miners into something else. And it's got to be more than minimum-wage goals. You can't take someone who's making $90,000 a year and tell him he's going to be making $22,000.\n\nWP: Is that any different than what Hillary Clinton said? Granted, you're not saying you'll put coal miners out of business.\n\nRO: No, look, what she wanted to do was give people the ability to go through job training. That doesn't do anything for West Virginia. I'm saying, we need to bring things to West Virginia, and people can get trained and work in those jobs.\n\nWP: What do you say to people who make up the majority of the party now, who say: Look, coal is killing us, and we need to stop taking carbon out of the ground?\n\nRO: I'll say this, and I've said this to people in Silicon Valley, too. There's no reason we don't have IT jobs in West Virginia. We've got people graduating from college with IT degrees and they leave the state. You've got to build these relationships. I understand global warming exists. When I was a kid, the best thing you could get was a sled, because when it snowed in November, you wouldn't see the ground again until April showers. Now we get one snowfall in December for three inches and one in January for six inches and that's it. We need to turn that around.\n\nWP: Where have you disagreed with the president since he took office?\n\nRO: Let me tell you something: He's got to stop with the hate. Just think about this, it's Veterans Day, and because it's cloudy, he chose not to go Arlington Cemetery and pay his respect. [Note: The White House did not explain why the president skipped Monday's ceremonies.] This is a person who'd fight with NFL players for not standing for the national anthem, but he doesn't pay his respect to people who have given their lives for this nation. He travels across middle America and stands in front of people with no awareness of what their lives are like.\n\nWP: What's he done right?\n\nRO: As a person from the coal hills of West Virginia, look, I like the fact that the coal industry has picked up. That's it. It's not exactly like he saved the day. We still have miners who are laid off; just recently, a small mine with 400 workers closed its doors, because they took advantage of bankruptcy law loopholes. It's like pigs at the trough for the 1 percent, and he's a big part of that.\n\nWP: Would Bernie Sanders have done better than Hillary Clinton did in West Virginia? Would any other Democrat have?\n\nRO: It's easy to say that but they didn't do it. I was able to turn people around. People are tired of looking at these career politicians, these people with net worths of $45 million, who don't know what their lives are like. Then Trump came in, and he laid a fine line of BS for people.\n\nWP: But you voted for Bernie in 2016; if he got into this, would you reconsider your own race?\n\nRO: Hey, I've already thrown my hat in the ring.\n\nWP: Let's imagine you're talking to a black voter in South Carolina or a Latino voter in Nevada, and they ask: How could you have voted for Trump, given what he was saying about my community? How would you answer that?\n\nRO: It was about the community in which I live, which is full of miners and people who work in the coal industry. That was the only vote I could make that would allow the people in my area continue to feed their families. My state's the only one that's lost population for 10 years in a row. He was saying some things that I found to be disgusting.\n\nWP: Would you run as a third-party candidate if this doesn't pan out?\n\nRO: No. I'm a Democrat. I'm going to remain a Democrat until the day I die. The party has gotten away from true-blue Democratic values, but I believe we can get it back.\n\nWP: Is there any circumstance, any way the Democratic nomination could wind up, where you'd vote for Trump again?\n\nRO: No way. There's no way I'd ever make that mistake again. Mistake. You can capitalize that.\n\n2020\n\nSherrod Brown. He told the Cleveland Plain Dealer that he's talking about the pros and cons of a White House run with his family: \u201cMy message clearly appeals to Democrats, Republicans and independents.\u201d\n\nJuli\u00e1n Castro.

He tells the AP that he's going to have the hard conversations about whether he could become the Democrats' 2020 nominee \u201cThanksgiving, Christmas and then maybe a few weeks into January.\u201d\n\nDEMS IN DISARRAY\n\nIt was an awkward question for Democrats ever since last Tuesday night: Who'd be the first to suggest that Ohio was no longer a swing state?\n\nWe got an answer today, when Priorities USA's Guy Cecil, coming off a mostly successful year for the Democratic super PAC, ranked the key swing states ahead of the 2020 presidential election. Cecil sliced up the country (outside of safe states for either party) in three ways.\n\nThe core states, competitive for each party: Florida, Michigan, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Nevada.\n\nThe expansion states, where Republicans begin with advantages: Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina.\n\nThe \u201cwatch\u201d states, where either Democrats or Republicans start clearly ahead: Colorado, Minnesota and Virginia for Democrats and Iowa, Ohio and Texas for Republicans.\n\nIn Cecil's view, Minnesota, which has not voted Republican for president since 1972, is now as strong for Democrats as Ohio is for Republicans. The question is whether any Democrat running for president will agree, in public. Multiple top contenders swept through the state this year, offering aid to what was generally seen as the party's best statewide ticket since 2006. It went down in flames, with only Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) winning reelection.\n\nREADING LIST\n\n\"Can moderate Democrats learn from recent history?\u201d by Ryan Cooper\n\nSome very early sounding of the alarm for the incoming class of Blue Dogs and New Democrats; the quest for tighter, balanced budgets led to disaster for the last class.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s Happening in Florida Is a Nightmare. 2020 Could Be So Much Worse,\u201d by Rick Hasen\n\nWhat's the long-term downside of our voting system, in which late-counted and provisional ballots tend to skew Democratic?

(Ian MacNicol/Getty Images)\n\nPAISLEY, Scotland \u2014 A 2018 campaign that began in San Diego sunshine closed Tuesday on a cold, rain-whipped night at a simple little stadium on the outskirts of Glasgow.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t, by any stretch of the imagination, a glamorous setting to mark the end of a year littered with few blemishes. And the performance featured more grit than elegance. But with a 1-0 victory over spirited Scotland, the top-ranked U.S. women\u2019s national soccer team capped the year the way the Americans began it and navigated it: without a defeat.\n\nAlex Morgan\u2019s goal late in the first half \u2014 the 98th of her career \u2014 secured an 18-0-2 record this year and extended an unbeaten streak to 28 since the summer of 2017. The Americans have recorded nine consecutive shutouts (albeit against overmatched opponents) and continue to pass every test, to varying degrees, in preparation for defending their title at the Women\u2019s World Cup next summer in France.\n\n\u201cWhat we did in 2018 is great and amazing,\" attacker Carli Lloyd said, \u201cbut what matters is how we are looking going into 2019 and when we get to the World Cup.\u201d\n\nThe Americans will learn their World Cup opponents Dec. 8 at the draw in Paris. Otherwise, they will embrace time off before reconvening in January ahead of another trip to Europe for matches against world contender France and an opponent to be determined.\n\n\u201cThere are still some steps to grow for this next six months,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cWe have a well-deserved break. My legs definitely need a break \u2014 not going to touch boots for two or three weeks at least. Then obviously we have to pick it back up and it\u2019s eyes on World Cup.\u201d\n\nCoach Jill Ellis began looking ahead by playing a pair of matches in Europe \u2014 a rarity for a program that rarely leaves home soil \u2014 against teams from traditional soccer-playing countries that have begun to succeed in the women\u2019s game.\n\nThe Americans labored to a 1-0 victory over Portugal on Thursday and encountered some difficult moments against Scotland, which has qualified for the World Cup for the first time.\n\nIn front of a crowd of 3,790 at St. Mirren Park, the Scots engaged in defensive tactics that, Ellis said, \u201cforces you into situations where you have to problem-solve. That\u2019s exactly what we needed and why we come to play games like this.\u201d\n\nThese matches also allowed her, with several roster absences, to play less-experienced players and tweak formations and tactics. Morgan, for instance, started on the left wing instead of center forward. Crystal Dunn, the starting left back all year, moved into central midfield.\n\nEmily Fox, a University of North Carolina sophomore from Ashburn, Va., debuted with the senior squad by starting both matches on this trip. She will now rejoin the Tar Heels for the remainder of the NCAA tournament.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m extremely thankful and excited,\u201d said Fox, a Stone Bridge High graduate who started at right back against Portugal and left back against Scotland. \u201cEven though it\u2019s only been two weeks, I feel like I\u2019ve learned so much that I can apply back home. The coaches and the team were very welcoming.\u201d\n\nFox and the Americans were tested a bit by the Scots, who were competent on the ball and threatened twice against second-choice goalkeeper Ashlyn Harris in the first half. Caroline Weir\u2019s free kick required a last-gasp clearance on the back side of the six-yard box. Later, Morgan cleared a corner kick off the goal line after the ball whizzed past Harris.\n\nOtherwise, the Americans were in control of the ball and the match. The absence of Tobin Heath (personal commitments) and Megan Rapinoe (muscle tightness) left them without their top wings and the usual relentless threats from wide positions.\n\nU.S. patience was rewarded in the 39th minute, however, as Mallory Pugh, a Washington Spirit winger, served a brilliant ball from the right side to Morgan, who slipped her mark and volleyed from six yards for her 18th goal in 19 appearances this year.\n\nThe margin remained tight because of Scotland\u2019s approach and discipline.\n\n\u201cWe set out to tactically make sure it was difficult for them,\u201d Scottish Coach Shelley Kerr said. \u201cYou could see that was the case. I never like losing. Neither do the players. But when you are playing the world champions, you have to be realistic.\u201d\n\nLloyd could have doubled the lead but rattled the crossbar with a penalty kick in the 62nd minute. Harris preserved the lead with a fine save in the 80th minute on Lana Clelland\u2019s searing bid.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a long year, a great year in terms of results,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cNow we rest up for next year.\u201d\n\nRead more from Soccer Insider:\n\nTwo players give USMNT a British accent heading into friendly vs. England\n\nKlinsmann is joining U.S. national soccer team (Jonathan, that is)\n\nHow 140 American soccer players abroad fared this weekend", "\n\nDavid Neeley of Berry Creek, Calif., and his 10-year-old daughter, Faith, wait at the Red Cross evacuation center at the Church of the Nazarene in Oroville, Calif., on Tuesday after they fled the Camp Fire in their town.

(Al Drago/Getty Images)\n\nColumnist\n\nHeadlines about the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in recent months have not been kind:\n\nBut stories like these (and these are all mine) don\u2019t give the whole picture.\n\nThis week of Veterans Day, more than four years after a patient wait-list scandal shamed the department and almost two years into President Trump\u2019s reign, is a good time to take stock of VA.\n\nThe department continues to generate controversy. The number of fiscal 2017 VA employee complaints to the Office of Special Counsel over \u201cprohibited personnel practices,\u201d including whistleblower retaliation, far exceeded those of any other agency, including the much larger Defense Department. VA was third on the list of cases per 1,000 employees.\n\nYet veterans continue to praise VA health care, just as they did when the agency\u2019s reputation swirled in the mud.\n\nListen to leaders of veterans\u2019 organizations and the department\u2019s inspector general:\n\nJoe Plenzler, Wounded Warrior Project spokesman: \u201cIf confidence in VA is measured by our warriors registering with VA, 75 percent receive health insurance through VA, compared to 59 percent in 2014, and 68 percent use VA as their primary health-care provider, and 90 percent of our wounded warriors receive VA disability benefits \u2026 but more can be done to get veterans to the care they deserve faster.\u201d\n\nGarry Augustine, executive director of Disabled American Veterans Washington: \u201cThere are certainly areas that need improvement, such as timely access to veterans benefits and services. However, our membership feels that VA is doing a good job overall.\u201d\n\nRyan Gallucci, director of National Veterans Service at Veterans of Foreign Wars: \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen over the past months, probably since the summer, is that the situation is improving. There are still significant challenges that need to be addressed \u2026 but we think VA is moving in the right direction.\u201d\n\nRoscoe Butler, deputy director of Veterans Affairs and Rehabilitation at the American Legion: \u201cVeterans say when they get into the system, the care they get is as good or better [than the private sector]. The challenge is access. It often takes a much longer time for new patients to get appointments than existing patients because of staffing.\u201d\n\nMichael J. Missal, inspector general: \u201cVA currently faces a number of significant and complex challenges, including implementing the new electronic health records management system, determining the future of community care, modernizing its supply chain management and financial reporting systems, reducing staffing shortages, and generally improving the quality and timeliness of health-care services and benefits programs. VA leadership is working to address these critical issues.\u201d VA\u2019s problems often have common sources, notably, he added, \u201cfailures in program leadership and governance, system deficiencies and inadequate staffing. These are often exacerbated by frequent turnover in key positions.\u201d\n\nFrequent turnover in key positions includes the top one. Since Trump took office less than two years ago, the department has had five leaders. That includes Robert Wilkie, who served twice, this spring in an acting capacity and since July as the full-time head. That office is filled, but many others remain empty. The department had over 45,000 vacancies in June, more than the population of Annapolis.\n\nIt\u2019s clear from the qualified endorsements that VA health care is good, but access often isn\u2019t.\n\nBeyond the anecdotal comments, that conclusion is backed by studies and data.\n\n\u201cConsistent with previous studies, our analysis found that VA health care system generally provides care that is higher in quality than what is offered elsewhere in communities across the nation,\u201d said Rebecca Anhang Price, senior policy researcher at the Rand Corp., a nonprofit research organization.\n\nRand cautioned, however, that \u201cthere is high variation in quality across individual VA facilities.\u201d\n\nVariation also applies to wait times. The department\u2019s website provides a tool that allows patients to learn average wait times at individual VA facilities. On Tuesday, I found wait times for new primary-care patients ranging from six days to 44 days at 12 locations within 50 miles of Washington. Less than a week isn\u2019t bad. Six weeks is too long. BTW, the Montgomery County VA clinic in Gaithersburg had the shortest wait. The Eastern Baltimore County VA clinic in Rosedale, Md., had the longest.\n\nMissal\u2019s office has examined wait times at individual VA medical facilities and found that many patients are waiting longer. His report on an outpatient clinic in Monterey, Calif., for example, indicates that the percentage of new patients waiting more than 30 days for primary-care appointments jumped from 1.63 percent in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 to 17.34 percent in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, in part because of a physician shortage.\n\nWilkie insisted, however, that it is getting better.\n\n\u201cVA is providing more health-care appointments than ever before, authorizing 32.7 million appointments in FY 2017, nearly 2 million more than in the previous year,\u201d he told the Senate in September. \u201cAll VA health-care facilities now provide same-day urgent primary and mental health-care services for veterans who need them. In June 2018, VA completed 95.18 percent of appointments within 30 days of the clinically indicated or veteran\u2019s preferred date; 83.46 percent within 7 days; and 20.29 percent the same day.\u201d\n\nWhatever the numbers, no one said VA\u2019s falsification of wait-list data remains the problem it was in 2014.\n\n\"We don\u2019t see any of that,\u201d said Chanin Nuntavong, the American Legion\u2019s director of Veterans Affairs and Rehabilitation.", "\n\nMigrants who traveled in the Central American caravan arrive at the Diversidad Migrante headquarters, which they will use as shelter, in Tijuana, Mexico. (Guillermo Arias/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe front line of what President Trump calls a migrant \u201cinvasion\u201d has arrived at the U.S. border \u2014 dozens of lesbian, gay and transgender asylum seekers from Central America.\n\nThe group has taken up shelter in a rented home in Tijuana, where they played Ariana Grande\u2019s music Monday night as they sorted through donated clothes, drank strawberry-banana juice and discussed how the asylum process might play out.\n\n\u201cI cannot believe we actually made it here to the border,\u201d said Andy Albaringa, 23, a trans woman from El Salvador. \u201cThe trip was so tiring.\u201d\n\nSmall groups have split off from the main Central American caravan moving north through Mexico, and they are made up of people fleeing an array of dangers and difficulties: Guatemalans leaving behind poverty, Hondurans escaping gang violence, Nicaraguans running from a harsh political crackdown. The groups have also become a refuge for those persecuted because of their sexual orientation.\n\nFor them, the day-to-day strain of traveling thousands of miles by foot and hitchhiking has been compounded by occasional harassment from other travelers, according to those in this LGBT group who arrived in Tijuana by bus from Mexico City this week.\n\n\u201cWe were discriminated against, even in the caravan,\u201d said Erick Dubon, 23, from San Pedro Sula, Honduras, who has been traveling with his boyfriend, Pedro Nehemias, 22. \u201cPeople wouldn\u2019t let us into trucks, they made us get in the back of the line for showers, they would call us ugly names.\u201d\n\nThe bulk of the caravan remains far from the border, in cities such as Guadalajara and Culiacan in western Mexico. As the first migrants trickle into Tijuana, U.S. border authorities say they are \u201chardening\u201d this crossing into San Diego \u201cin preparation for the migrant caravan and the potential safety and security risk that it could cause.\u201d\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection said in a statement that it is closing four lanes at the San Ysidro and Otay Mesa border crossings \u2014 some of the most heavily traveled ports of entry along the U.S.-Mexico border. The statement added that U.S. troops are putting up concertina wire, barricades and fencing.\n\n\n\nU.S. soldiers install barbed wire on the border with Mexico, seen from Colonia Libertad in Tijuana on Monday.

C\u00e9sar Palencia, director of the Tijuana Municipal Migration Affairs Office, said there is shelter space for 900 in the city, although they will need more mattresses, blankets and clothes for those arriving.\n\nPalencia said city officials are worried about the larger group of at least 3,000 they expect in the next couple of weeks.\n\n\u201cWe are expecting more of these little groups, but we don\u2019t know right now exactly what we are going to do with the big caravan,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we will make room.\u201d\n\nMany of the migrants plan to apply for asylum in the United States, which means waiting, perhaps for days or weeks, to be processed at a port of entry. When large groups of migrants have shown up in Tijuana in the past, such as more than 15,000 Haitians who arrived in 2016, many lived in shelters or tent camps as their claims were slowly processed, and thousands ultimately settled in Mexico. For all those who apply for asylum, only a small percentage receive it.\n\nLast week, the Trump administration introduced new measures intended to deny asylum to those who cross the border illegally. The move was quickly challenged in court. Such a change would not affect the caravan if the migrants requested asylum at a port of entry.\n\nThe arrival in Tijuana of the LGBT group has not been welcomed by everyone. Santiago Alvarez, a police officer on duty outside their rental house, said that people have stopped by \u201cknocking on the door, shouting things, telling them to leave.\u201d\n\n\u201cA few of the migrants left to go buy a couple of things, and they were harassed and insulted in the street,\u201d he said. \u201cThis president, Trump, this wall \u2014 it is all so ridiculous. We\u2019ve had migration for years, and these people just want to get to the U.S. They just want something better.\u201d\n\nDuring the previous caravan, an LGBT group had a difficult time during the two weeks they waited in Tijuana, according to Nicole Ramos, an immigration lawyer.\n\n\u201cThey experienced a lot of violence, including having the shelter they were staying in robbed and set on fire,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are vulnerable.\u201d\n\n\n\nKeisha Kataleia of Honduras split with a group from the caravan and is staying at a shelter for LGBT groups that have arrived in Tijuana.

Officials were initially reluctant to open camps for homeless Venezuelan arrivals but now say they have no choice as the number fleeing their nation\u2019s economic and humanitarian crisis continues to rapidly escalate. (Fernando Vergara/Associated Press)\n\nBOGOTA, Colombia \u2014 Colombian authorities moved homeless Venezuelan migrants to a soccer field filled with yellow tents and cots Tuesday, as the number of migrants fleeing their nation\u2019s economic and humanitarian calamity has risen.\n\nThe first migrant camp for Venezuelans in Colombia\u2019s capital sparked a protest from residents who said they feared their new neighbors would bring crime and disease \u2014 the latest hint of escalating tensions throughout the region over the spillover of Venezuela\u2019s crisis.\n\n\u201cThey want to ruin our communities!\u201d a man cried out from his balcony overlooking the field of tents, later switching to English and yelling, \u201cWelcome to the jungle!\u201d\n\nColombian officials had been reluctant to set up refugee-style camps, even while similar sites have been created at Ecuador\u2019s border with Peru and in Brazil. The new camp is modeled after a temporary refugee settlement for Syrian arrivals in France.\n\nAuthorities fear camps could become permanent fixtures and hinder Venezuelans from integrating into society. But with over 1 million Venezuelans now living in Colombia, officials said they had no choice but to offer tents to destitute migrants.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing else left to do,\u201d said Cristina Velez, Bogota\u2019s secretary for social integration.\n\nThe migrants taken to the camp had been living in a park outside a bus station in conditions considered a potential public health risk. Families with young children were living cramped together alongside railroad tracks and cooking food over makeshift fires. Many had reached Bogota after long walks by foot and didn\u2019t have enough money to rent a room.\n\nVelez said Colombian officials talked with their counterparts in Paris over Skype to determine how to create a temporary camp, settling on a model that would keep families together while dividing up single men and women into separate tents. Migrants will be allowed to stay at the camp for up to three months and will be given information on accessing education and health care.\n\nThe initial capacity for the camp will be 500 people, though Velez said officials will evaluate whether a more permanent fixture is needed.\n\n\u201cWe are going step by step because everything has changed very quickly,\u201d she said.\n\nThe current exodus from Venezuela began in mid-2015 and has climbed steadily as Venezuelans face crippling hyperinflation, food and medicine shortages, and high crime. According to the United Nations, a total of 2.3 million have fled in the last three years alone.\n\nColombia has received more migrants than any other nation at a time when it is already tackling a litany of domestic issues including surging coca production and a fragile peace process with leftist rebels.\n\nThe arrival of so many Venezuelans has sparked xenophobic attacks throughout the region. Last month, a group of Venezuelans living in Colombia\u2019s capital said a mob beat a man to death and ransacked their homes while shouting slurs against foreigners. In Brazil, violence erupted after a local storeowner was stabbed and beaten in an assault blamed on Venezuelan migrants.\n\nAs officials transported the Venezuelans to the new camp in Bogota, a dozen angry residents stood in front of a gate attempting to block their arrival. Residents in a large new condominium sat on their balconies now overlooking a field of yellow tents and cots and took photos. Several said they were angry officials hadn\u2019t given them advance notice while others worried Venezuelans would take their jobs.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be left with nothing,\u201d said Esperanza Contreras, 60, who sells grilled corn and said she feared Venezuelans willing to work for less would steal her customers.\n\nStill others complained that Colombian officials chose a field prone to flooding and expressed worry about sanitary conditions for several hundred migrants sharing 10 portable toilets. They said officials should do more to make sure migrants have access to safe water, food and jobs.\n\n\u201cNot even animals should be there!\u201d Giovanna Sanchez, 35, shouted into a microphone outside the camp.\n\nVenezuelans arriving at the camp said they were jolted by the protest.\n\n\u201cI feel less safe because of what we\u2019re seeing outside,\u201d one man said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want us here.\u201d\n\nAs they completed a registration process and made their way toward the tents, many said they felt deceived by authorities who had promised showers and food.\n\nIvonne Jaimes, 27, cried as she sat on a cot with her 1-year-old son wondering when she would be able to bathe him. She feared they would end up spending more money living at the camp since they are not allowed to cook inside.\n\n\u201cI feel trapped here,\u201d she said.\n\n__\n\nFor more on Associated Press coverage of Venezuela\u2019s migrant crisis: https://www.apnews.com/VenezuelaExodus\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)\n\nWe start with a bit of speculation.\n\nLet\u2019s assume for the sake of our calculus that every currently leading candidate in still-uncalled House races ends up winning. That means, for example, that Rep. Mia Love (R-Utah) is booted from office but Rep. Mimi Walters (R-Calif.) holds her seat. In Walters\u2019s case, it doesn\u2019t matter much to the demographics of the chamber, since her opponent is also a white woman. In Love\u2019s case, it shifts the composition of the House, losing a black woman and adding (another) white man.\n\nOverall, though, the gender shifts in the house have been in the other direction. With the assumption above, we estimate based on data compiled by DailyKos that 30 women won seats formerly held by men, with men picking up 10 seats held by women. (That includes people who didn\u2019t seek reelection, like Rep. Kristi L. Noem (R) of South Dakota.)\n\nThe shift by race and ethnicity also moved toward a less solidly white chamber. By our count, 17 white representatives are being replaced by members of other racial or ethnic groups, including eight incoming African American legislators. Three black legislators are being replaced by white legislators, including Love and Rashida Tlaib\u2019s victory in Michigan\u2019s 13th District.\n\nYou would be forgiven, then, if you assumed that the number of white American men who are represented by white men in the House would have dropped since the last Congress.\n\nYou would be wrong.\n\nWe pulled demographic data from every House district, including the redrawn districts in Pennsylvania. The difference in representation is stark: Nearly 9 in 10 white Americans are represented by a white person in the House while only 10 percent of Asian Americans are. More remarkably, given that there are more women in the United States than men, only 23 percent of women are represented by women in the House, while three-quarters of men are.\n\nAs for the overlap? Fully 73 percent of white American men are represented by white men in Congress.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nIf Love wins her race, that drops only slightly, from 72.8 to 72.5 percent.\n\nRemarkably, that\u2019s a higher percentage of white men represented by white men than we saw at the beginning of the last Congress in 2017.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\n(We didn\u2019t calculate the figure for white women at the beginning of the 115th Congress.)\n\nNotice that several demographic groups saw increases in representation. Most notable is Native Americans, following the election of the first two Native American women to Congress. The density of Hispanic legislators also increased.\n\nBut that white-men figure! The percentage of whites represented by a white person in Congress fell slightly, and the percentage of men represented by men dropped even further. Despite that, the percentage of white men represented by white men went up.\n\nWhy? In part because the Republican delegation became even more heavily made up of white men. Cook Political Report estimates that the Republican caucus will go from 86 percent white men to 90 percent in the new session. The difference in diversity between the two parties is stark.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nRepublican districts are home to nearly 60 percent of the white men in the country, making up the bulk of that 73 percent representation by white men.\n\nThis, really, is one of the main stories of the 2018 election: The divide represented by racial and gender splits in the U.S. became sharper in the House than it was before.", "Alex Morgan scored late in the first half and the U.S. national team wrapped up the year with a 1-0 victory Tuesday over Scotland in Glasgow.\n\nThe U.S. team is undefeated this year with 19 wins and two ties.

Rumors of potential motives swirled as police undertook one of the largest investigations in Ohio\u2019s history, leaving many to wonder when \u2014 or if \u2014 the suspects responsible would be apprehended.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, answers finally arrived.\n\n\u201cWe promised that the day would come when the arrests would be made in the Pike County massacres,\u201d Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine told a crowd of reporters Tuesday. \u201cToday is that day.\u201d\n\nGeorge \u201cBilly\u201d Wagner III, 47, Angela Wagner, 48, George Wagner IV, 27, and Edward \u201cJake\u201d Wagner, 26, all of South Webster, were each charged with eight counts of aggravated murder with death penalty specifications, among other related charges in connection with planning and carrying out the killings, DeWine said.\n\nRita Newcomb, 65, and Fredericka Wagner, 76, the mothers of Angela and Billy Wagner, were also charged and accused of attempting to cover up the crime to mislead authorities, DeWine said. All of the suspects were arrested without incident. It is unclear whether they have retained attorneys.\n\nEarly reports of the deaths describe a devastating scene in rural Pike County. An initial call to police on April 22, 2016, cited two male victims, possibly deceased, at a home on Union Hill Road in Piketon, a village in Pike County, Ohio, authorities said at the time. As they were traveling there, deputies were flagged down and given additional information on reports of bodies.\n\nIn a recording released soon after the killings, a woman was heard telling a 911 dispatcher that she had found her brother-in-law and cousin inside a trailer without signs of life.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s blood all over,\u201d the woman, later identified as Bobby Manley by the Cincinnati Enquirer, told the dispatcher. Asked if she thought they were dead, Manley indicated yes, adding, \u201cIt looks like someone has beat the hell out of them.\u201d\n\nManley cried into her phone as she waited for help to arrive.\n\nSeven of the victims' bodies were initially found among three different trailer homes, all within walking distance of one another, and many were still lying in bed, DeWine said. The eighth was found at a fourth location that was a 10-minute drive away.\n\nAmong those killed were Christopher Rhoden Sr., 40; his ex-wife Dana Manley Rhoden, 37; and their three children, Hanna May Rhoden, 19, Christopher Rhoden Jr., 16, and Clarence \u201cFrankie\u201d Rhoden, 20.

No other suspects are connected to the case, he said, and evidence suggests the Wagners spent months meticulously planning the crimes by studying the Rhoden family\u2019s habits and routines. He alleged that the four suspects knew the layouts of the victims' homes and where they slept, and that after killing them, the Wagners tampered with phones, a silencer, shell casings and surveillance cameras in an attempt to hide evidence.\n\nEach of the Wagners was also charged with conspiracy, engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity, aggravated burglary, tampering with evidence and obstruction of justice, as well as several other charges.\n\n\n\nThe four people arrested in the 2016 slayings of eight family members in Pike County, Ohio.

Tens of thousands of hours went into the investigation, spanning 2\u00bd years over 10 states, including Alaska, where the Wagner family moved briefly before returning to Pike County. Police received more than 1,100 tips from the public, tested more than 700 pieces of evidence and conducted nearly 600 interviews over the course of their investigation. DeWine likened the case to a complex puzzle with hundreds of pieces.\n\n\u201cWhat solved this case was just hard, tough police work, day after day after day,\u201d DeWine said. \u201cThese men and women just never gave up.\u201d\n\nOfficials Tuesday noted that the families of the victims are still coping with the deaths of their loved ones, and that the suspects' alleged actions left a stain on the county.

Garcia, who is just over five feet tall, is getting treatment and is now 105 pounds \u2014 a safer weight than the 79 pounds of a year ago. (Andre Chung/For The Washington Post)\n\nAnais Garcia, 21, anxiously stares at the menu of a Bob Evans restaurant in Baltimore. Her dark brown eyes gravitate toward the Fit and Healthy section, which lists calories per meal. She takes a long time figuring out what to order and decides to go with her \u201csafe meal,\u201d a small stack of pancakes, with no butter, reduced-calorie syrup, a small bowl of fruit on the side and a cup of black coffee.\n\n\u201cRestaurants are like battle zones for me, literal war zones,\u201d she says.\n\nA ballerina who contended with anorexia nervosa for years, Garcia, who is 5-foot-1\u00bd tall, has reached 105 pounds, a safer weight than the 79 pounds of a year ago. In her gray turtleneck sweater and casual black leggings, her extreme thinness remains apparent. \u201cFor the past five years, I\u2019ve done nothing but hate and try to disown my body,\u201d she says.\n\nBallet celebrates the body \u2014 and thinness. Despite demands for change from dancers who have experienced problems and from psychologists specializing in eating disorders, the stereotype that a dancer must be elegant and lean persists. Ballerinas become vulnerable to self-consciousness about their bodies, and they face increased risk of anorexia, bulimia nervosa and other eating disorders.\n\nGenerally, someone who develops an eating disorder has a predisposition, with several factors at play. For ballerinas, \u201cit is of course the ballet culture,\u201d which is competitive and demanding, says Linda Hamilton, a New York psychologist who has worked with ballerinas with eating disorders. But \u201cyou might also have a personality predisposition,\u201d she says. \u201cA perfectionist personality can make the dancer intolerant of any physical changes.\u201d\n\nSometimes, \u201cthe disorders start early, as young as 12,\u201d she says, because the curves that come with puberty don\u2019t fit the ballet look.\n\n\n\nGarcia no longer pursues a professional career in ballet, but she dances as a hobby. \u201cI\u2019m going into the studio by myself and put on some music and just dance,\u201d she says. \u201cI did it for so long in my life that I miss it.\u201d (Andre Chung/For The Washington Post)\n\n'A dangerous spiral'\n\n\u201cOne out of two dancers suffer from an eating disorder,\u201d Hamilton says. \u201cIt\u2019s still an ongoing problem and it needs to be addressed, because once ballerinas develop an eating disorder, it\u2019s hard to recover.\u201d\n\nBorn in Columbia, Md., Garcia was brought up by her mother after her parents divorced and started dancing when she was 3. By middle school, intent on pursuing a professional ballet career, she was dancing four to eight hours a day. \u201cIt just became an obsession,\u201d she says.\n\nShe became a professional at 19. She danced for two years across the United States, performing in Miami, in Washington for the Washington Ballet and in New York for Dance Theatre of Harlem.\n\n\u201cIt got really serious very fast,\u201d Garcia says.\n\nNo one in her family ever ridiculed her for her size, she says, attributing her eating disorder to the competitive nature of ballet itself.\n\nAt 13, living in Baltimore, she was determined to enter the Baltimore School for the Arts (BSA), a respected public high school with an outstanding reputation in ballet. She was rejected, she says, not because of her dancing but because the faculty decided she needed more muscle tone.\n\n\u201cI remember that when she didn\u2019t get in, it was her mother who contacted me and we spoke about her weak muscle tone,\u201d says Norma Pera, the dance department head. \u201cWe are looking for a body that is physically fit enough to aerobically do the work.\u201d\n\nGarcia auditioned again and was admitted at 14, as a sophomore. Teachers, she said, repeatedly said she was \u201ctoo soft\u201d and encouraged her to have more \u201cmuscle tone\u201d \u2014 terms she took as code for \u201cfat.\u201d\n\nPera says that at BSA, \u201cwe never tell a student that they\u2019re fat . . . that would be a very destructive and horrible thing to say.\u201d She says she doesn\u2019t make comments that imply a student should look skinnier. \u201cThe student hears what they want to hear,\u201d she says.\n\nGarcia started school at a normal and healthy weight, about 115 pounds. By the end of her sophomore year, she had lost 15 pounds, and in the high-pressure environment, her weight kept dropping. \u201cI slowly slipped into a dangerous spiral of wanting to please my teachers,\u201d Garcia says.\n\nGarcia is convinced her lower weight produced results.\n\nWhen she won the lead role of Clara in \u201cThe Nutcracker,\u201d in her senior year of high school, she felt that reinforced the idea that \u201cbeing skinnier was better.\u201d She began using laxatives, purging, skipping meals and overexercising, to lose still more weight.\n\n\u201cFor some reason at that stage, I broke down,\u201d she says. \u201cAt the very end, when I was doing my bow.\u201d\n\nShe understood she was ill and \u201cthat my sickness was only going to get worse and that anorexia had taken everything that once made me happy, and just made it a living hell,\u201d she says.\n\nBut her desire to become a professional was more powerful than her sickness.\n\nA culture of mixed messages\n\nPera says that she and the other teachers had no indication that Garcia was going through a severe eating disorder.\n\n\u201cI thought she was quite happy at Baltimore School for the Arts,\u201d Pera says. \u201cI am sorry that she feels she had to lose weight to get a role, but that\u2019s not true.\u201d\n\nIn the early 1990s, Hamilton and Michelle Warren, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Columbia University and an expert on eating disorders, spent three years surveying dancers at the School of American Ballet, affiliated with the New York City Ballet, to see which dancers developed eating disorders.\n\nThey noticed that most students denied having an eating disorder, even when they showed symptoms of anorexia or bulimia nervosa. The researchers canceled their survey after 70 percent of the dancers dropped out of the study because they started to encounter trouble with the school.\n\nMore than 20 years later, ballerinas remain exposed to the same problems.\n\nMost ballet schools have incorporated nutritionists and other programs to help dancers stay healthy, but \u201coften you get mixed messages,\u201d Hamilton says. The companies and schools may talk about health, \u201cthen you see that the skinniest dancers are the ones who are getting cast\u201d in lead roles.\n\nTo address eating disorders in ballet, Hamilton says, \u201cthe whole environment has to support that,\u201d including teachers and choreographers at ballet schools. They have to educate dancers, to prevent them from developing dysfunctional eating habits or relapsing after treatment.\n\nGarcia had graduated from BSA in spring 2015. She decided to start company auditions a year later, after dropping out from her first semester at Towson University in Baltimore, where she was majoring in dance performance.\n\n\u201cPursuing companies full time meant I had to watch what I was eating,\u201d she says, calling it probably the worst decision she had made because \u201cI was eating a granola bar and a coffee per day.\u201d\n\nFacing the illness\n\nGarcia checked into the Renfrew Center of Philadelphia in August 2017 for treatment of her eating disorder, a decision that followed what she calls the \u201chell semester.\u201d\n\nShe remembers a cold morning in March that year, when she decided to have photos shot to include in her portfolio for dance company applications. She was wearing a thin, red dress with no jacket.\n\n\u201cMy body was so thin and weak,\u201d Garcia says. \u201cI just wanted to die. I was so weak, I couldn\u2019t move. I was ready to peacefully go.\u201d\n\nBut her mother called the paramedics, who arrived when she was passed out on the sofa. After checking her vitals, they determined that her pulse was very low and that she had just suffered from a panic attack. \u201cI look at those photos now, and it\u2019s devastating and scary.\u201d\n\nGarcia\u2019s final audition came later that month. She had an opportunity to audition with Dance Theatre of Harlem in New York.\n\n\u201cI told my mom, \u2018I have to go, this will be it!\u2019 \u201d But as she was going upstairs to put on her black leotard and ballet shoes, she recognized for the first time, as two psychiatrists had previously suggested, that she had body dysmorphia \u2014 a body image disorder that causes people to constantly worry about their appearance and to obsess over their looks.\n\nShe realized how weak she had become.\n\n\u201cI pushed through everything, but this was bad, because I admitted it,\u201d she says. On her way home from New York, she recalls grasping that her illness had worsened. \u201cI never went to another audition.\u201d\n\nGarcia entered the intensive inpatient program at Renfrew after enduring serious depression for months. Her heartbeat was a very low 35 beats per minute. \u201cThey said it was bad. My heart was literally stopping,\u201d she says. But the doctors fed her and plied her with Ga\u00adtor\u00adade. Within a week, her heartbeat had risen to a normal 75 beats per minute.\n\nDuring the three-week program, doctors diagnosed her with anorexia, anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nAfter she completed the inpatient and partial hospitalization program at Renfrew, she transferred to its intensive outpatient program, which allowed her to move home to Baltimore, checking in with therapists and nutritionists three times a week.\n\nAccording to Renfrew\u2019s staff, Garcia\u2019s ideal weight is 115 pounds.\n\nEventually she transferred to the Renfrew Center in Baltimore, where she attends a mandatory Monday support group with her mother and boyfriend.\n\nOn a recent Monday, she and 13 other patients suffering from anorexia, bulimia or binge eating are sitting in a spacious, bright conference room at Renfrew, waiting for family members or loved ones to arrive.\n\nHere, patients can talk about the difficulties and challenges of their disorders with people who share the problem. A therapist leads the conversation.\n\nWhen the meeting begins, the family members and loved ones introduce themselves and say whom they\u2019ve come to support. \u201cHi, my name is Wanda, and I am here to support Anais,\u201d says Garcia\u2019s mother. Anais, who has looked depressed, breaks into a smile, proud that her mother is still by her side. Her boyfriend then says the same thing.\n\nMany of the patients look extremely sick, thin and anxious. A young woman in the front of the room, who won\u2019t even look at her parents, constantly bites her nails. But Garcia holds her mother\u2019s hand.\n\nThe therapist passes around handouts to spur patients\u2019 discussion on how a loved one has cared for them through their disorders.\n\n\u201cTake a couple of minutes to decide which term best identifies your relationship with the patient,\u201d the therapist instructs.\n\n\u201cMom, I think this is you,\u201d Garcia says after some debate. She points to \u201cThe Kangaroo,\u201d the type of person who does everything to protect the patient, often taking over all aspects of his or her life. But Wanda says she identifies more with \u201cThe Dolphin,\u201d who \u201cis helping someone with an eating disorder by gently nudging them along.\u201d\n\nAfter an hour, the discussion ends and the Garcias head home. It\u2019s one of Anais\u2019s last meetings, before she finally can say she has recovered.\n\nGarcia no longer pursues a professional career in ballet, but she is dancing as a hobby. \u201cI\u2019m going into the studio by myself and put on some music and just dance,\u201d she says. \u201cI did it for so long in my life that I miss it.\u201d\n\nShe is on a new career path, majoring in exercise science at Towson. She plans to go into a physical therapy school afterward.\n\nRead more\n\nThis is your brain on art\n\nShe was 11, with an eating disorder.

Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) and Arlington leaders agreed to give Amazon direct subsidies totaling $573 million based on the company creating 25,000 jobs with an average salary of $150,000.\n\nThe state and county also will invest a total of $223 million for transportation improvements that will benefit Amazon as well as the rest of the community, officials said.\n\n\u201cWe are excited to build new headquarters in New York City and Northern Virginia,\u201d Amazon founder and CEO Jeffrey P. Bezos said in a statement. (Bezos also owns The Washington Post.) \u201cThese two locations will allow us to attract world-class talent that will help us to continue inventing for customers for years to come. The team did a great job selecting these sites, and we look forward to becoming an even bigger part of these communities.\u201d\n\nThe money, subject to approval by the Virginia General Assembly, also includes $195 million in transportation improvements to nearby Metro stations and to Reagan National Airport, as well as construction of a pedestrian bridge connecting the airport to company\u2019s new hub \u2014 which will be in a newly branded neighborhood called \u201cNational Landing\u201d encompassing parts of Pentagon City and Crystal City in Arlington and Potomac Yard in Alexandria.\n\nVirginia\u2019s tech talent and stable business environment were keys to landing the project, Northam said.\n\nStanding in a Crystal City warehouse that will be redeveloped for the company, Northam vowed that with Amazon on the way, the complex of dated and largely vacant government office buildings will put the commonwealth \u201con the leading edge of the next technology and innovation breakthrough.\u201d\n\nOther states offered the company more money, and Northam paired the announcement of the deal with a plan to spend up to $1.1 billion over 20 years to expand tech education at the state\u2019s community colleges and universities \u2014 allowing him to assert that the heavy majority of the spending would not benefit just Amazon.\n\nVirginia Tech announced plans to build a $1 billion graduate campus in Alexandria focused on innovation.\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of the commonwealth\u2019s proposal represents investments in our people and our infrastructure that will align with Amazon\u2019s long-term goal while supporting the growth and competitiveness of businesses all across Virginia,\u201d Northam said.\n\n[Read Virginia\u2019s agreement with Amazon]\n\nThe decision hands Northam and local leaders the largest economic-development prize in a generation \u2014 one promising $2.5 billion in capital investments and $3.2 billion in net tax revenue over 20 years \u2014 but could also put pressure on the region\u2019s already steep housing prices and congested roads, and its yawning divide between wealthy and low-income residents.\n\nAccording to a 25-page agreement between the company and the state, Amazon expects to hire 400 people in 2019 and 1,180 the following year. It expects to create a minimum of 25,000 jobs by 2030 and potentially a total of 37,850 by 2034.\n\nNew York Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) \u2014 who had joked that he would change his name to \u201cAmazon Cuomo\u201d if necessary to land the project \u2014 also claimed victory Tuesday.\n\nNew York leaders offered Amazon more money than Virginia \u2014 more than $1.5 billion, much of it also tied to the company\u2019s job growth and salaries.\n\n[How can the D.C. region absorb Amazon if it can\u2019t cope now with gridlock and housing costs?]\n\nThe final suitors included the District, Montgomery County and 16 other jurisdictions Amazon considered since narrowing its list in January. D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) and Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) both applauded the announcement.\n\nNeither will have to pony up incentives to the company, but experts say both should see economic gains as a result. Bowser called on regional leaders to create concrete affordable-housing goals to address an acute problem that economists say is likely to worsen as Amazon grows.\n\n\u201cAmazon in Arlington is a win for D.C.,\u201d Bowser said in a statement. \u201cWe will continue preparing residents with the skills and knowledge they need for the jobs of the future, including at Amazon.\u201d\n\nMaryland officials had offered one of the richest known incentive packages, at $8.5 billion. Sen. Benjamin L. Cardin (D-Md.) said that while he was \u201crooting for Montgomery County,\u201d Amazon\u2019s investment would draw many new residents to Maryland.\n\nHogan said he expects to see other companies relocate to the state for proximity to Amazon. \u201cCollectively, we will not only gain 25,000 corporate-level jobs, but also many businesses that are part of Amazon\u2019s supply chain,\u201d Hogan said.\n\n[Northern Va. property owners are delighted Amazon is moving in. Renters, first-time buyers and low-income residents aren\u2019t.]\n\nOpposition to the move started shortly after the announcement, however, as groups dedicated to fighting inequality and opposed to corporate subsidies began rallying their supporters in New York and Virginia as details of the deal began to emerge.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been getting calls and outreach from Queens residents all day about this.

That is the highest rate of return for an economic incentive program that the state has ever offered,\u201d Cuomo said. He contrasted it with the return from the state\u2019s film tax credit, which he said brings the state $1.15 for every $1 it invests.\n\nSimilar concerns emerged in Virginia.\n\n\u201cThousands of new high-paying jobs could be a boon to our community, but we deserve to know the cost,\u201d said Anna Scholl, executive director of the advocacy group Progress Virginia. \u201cTens of thousands of new workers and their families are sure to strain community resources when it comes to affordable housing, mass transit and traffic, and quality local schools. It\u2019s only right that Amazon pay their fair share.\u201d\n\nResidents in the nearby Del Ray neighborhood expressed concerns earlier this year that Amazon\u2019s arrival would worsen daily rush-hour backups that already slow traffic to a crawl and would erode the quality of life in their neighborhood of mostly single-family homes.\n\nJay Carney, Amazon\u2019s senior vice president of worldwide corporate affairs, said that the company considered all the locations carefully and reviewed 100 metrics but ultimately made its decision \u2014 including the choice to split the project \u2014 based on how best the company could recruit the talent it needs.\n\n\u201cWe came to realize that of course these are two fantastic metropolitan areas, and each of the areas has an existing pool of talent and are fantastic places to live,\u201d he said in a phone interview.\n\n[How Crystal City, the future home of Amazon\u2019s new headquarters, got its name]\n\nCarney said that Amazon would apply some of the lessons it had learned from its growth in Seattle \u2014 where housing costs rose dramatically during the company\u2019s expansion \u2014 to its new locations. He said Bezos was \u201cinvolved very deeply\u201d in the process and was in every leadership meeting where it was discussed.\n\nAmazon\u2019s decision to split the project rather than open a second headquarters on par with its Seattle campus has angered some who said the company had ginned up competition among cities only to change the rules midstream. Some said it was unfair that the company seemed to consider only sites in more-affluent communities.\n\n\u201cOne thing that\u2019s different here is we are planning in advance with these cities,\u201d Carney said. \u201cAmazon started in a garage. Nobody foresaw, not even Jeff, when they got launched that Amazon would become what it became or that we would have tens of thousands of employees in Seattle alone.\u201d\n\nAmazon launched the project in fall 2017, dubbing it \u201cHQ2\u201d and issuing search criteria for \u201ca second corporate headquarters\u201d with as many as 50,000 jobs and an investment of $5 billion.\n\nAlthough 238 locations initially submitted proposals to Amazon, many experts considered the Washington region a favorite from the outset because of Bezos\u2019s personal connections in the region, particularly the $23 million mansion he purchased in the city\u2019s Kalorama neighborhood last year and his ownership of The Post.\n\nCarney said those were not among the 100 metrics the company looked at. \u201cIt\u2019s not a factor,\u201d he said. \u201cHe lives in Seattle. He has a family there.\u201d\n\nIn picking Crystal City, Amazon opted for a close-in suburban site, just across the Potomac River from Washington and a half-mile from National Airport.\n\n[Amazon could be boon or bust for Metro and the region\u2019s transportation infrastructure]\n\nAmong the announced transportation improvements are new access points to the Crystal City Metro station and the planned Potomac Yard station. Amazon also wants a helipad, and Arlington has said that the county staff will help obtain the necessary local, state and federal approval, according to a letter from County Manager Mark Schwartz that was released with other information about the deal.\n\nSince launching the high-profile search last year, Bezos and the company made several announcements that some expected would soften Amazon\u2019s image as it moved to open its second hub.\n\nBezos announced in September that he would donate $2 billion of his own money to support groups battling homelessness in the United States and to create a network of preschools in underserved communities.\n\nIn October, after bearing months of criticism from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) over its treatment of workers, Amazon announced that it would raise its minimum wage for all employees to $15 per hour, although the decision is not likely to have much effect on the company\u2019s hiring in Northern Virginia.\n\nThe expected windfall from the development will not immediately solve local governments\u2019 budget woes, either. Schwartz said Arlington County is still considering layoffs and budget cuts in the coming year.\n\n\u201cEverybody thinks it\u2019s going to be this magical elixir right away,\u201d he said.\n\nPatricia Sullivan, Michael Laris and Fenit Nirappil in Washington and Gregory S.

Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign, said the wins were a rejection of the Trump administration.\n\n\u201cThe days of attacking LGBTQ people for political gain are over, and the American people will not stand for lawmakers who try to drum up votes by trafficking in hate,\u201d Griffin said of Trump and Vice President Pence.\n\nIt isn\u2019t shocking given the current political climate that more gay politicians are headed to Washington.\n\nGay Americans have previously expressed frustration with the Trump administration and its polices and proposals, including a Health and Human Services Department proposal to require that people identify with the sex they were assigned at birth, not the one with which they identify, and Trump\u2019s declared ban on transgender people serving in the military. Members of the LGBT community have repeatedly felt slighted by Trump after he failed to acknowledge LGBT Pride Month, World AIDS Day and other events that were marked by previous administrations. And several LGBT-rights organizations fear that an executive order Trump signed that is popular with conservative Christians could open the doors for more discrimination against gay Americans.\n\nBut these members shouldn\u2019t focus merely on LGBT-rights issues, said activist Keith Boykin, who served in President Bill Clinton\u2019s administration.\n\n\u201cLGBTQ elected officials should focus on the same issues that got them elected. For most of them, that\u2019s bread-and-butter issues like health care, jobs and education. That doesn\u2019t mean they should avoid LGBT issues, but they should focus on all issues that affect their constituents,\u201d Boykin said.\n\nWhile the gay community has made gains in cultural acceptance \u2014 most Americans today support same-sex marriage \u2014 activists argue that there is more to be done, including fighting to make sexual orientation a federally protected class against discrimination. Even if those issues aren\u2019t the main focus of new lawmakers, the fact that gay Americans will now be more represented in Congress means these issues will probably have better odds of being addressed.", "Neomi Rao, administrator of the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, attends a Diwali ceremony at the White House on Nov. 13.

The blaze had killed two people, destroyed more than 400 structures and charred more than 96,000 acres by Tuesday morning. The video, which shows a rapidly rotating funnel of flames, illustrates how devastating this wildfire has been to the communities around Thousand Oaks and Malibu.\n\nThe vortex spun up in the western suburbs of Malibu along the coast Friday morning. It snapped power lines and lofted debris hundreds of feet into the air. It had the look and power of a tornado, but was it technically a twister?\n\nIn most cases, firewhirls \u2014 small spouts of spinning air akin in strength to a dust devil \u2014 can be classified as tornadoes. However, Friday\u2019s episode may walk the lines of what could be classified as a true tornado.\n\nThe National Weather Service defines a tornado as \u201ca violently rotating column of air, usually pendant to a cumulonimbus, with circulation reaching the ground.\u201d\n\nThe rapacious winds were probably 80 or 90 mph, based on the debris and damage shown in the video. The fire\u2019s heat carried stormlike plumes of ash towering to 18,000 feet, with updrafts snaking high into the sky. But the circulation appears to be shallow. Looking at the strongest rotational signature of the day (possibly responsible for spawning this twister), it extends to about 4,000 feet \u2014 vs. 20,000 feet or more for a traditional tornado.\n\n\n\nA 3-D radar image of the fire tornado near Malibu on Nov. 9. (Matthew Cappucci)\n\nThe rotation \u2014 which showed up on radar at a strength commensurate with most EF-0 or EF-1 tornadoes \u2014 was anticyclonic, or clockwise. Even though that\u2019s not evidence the whirl didn\u2019t come from a storm (which can rotate in either direction, though less commonly clockwise), it suggests the rotation developed near the ground, rather than being rooted in the clouds.\n\nIn the case of the Carr Fire tornado in July, the entire storm cloud was rotating, and it behaved like a supercell thunderstorm. In Malibu on Friday, that wasn\u2019t the case.\n\nThe vortex probably developed in response to local forces. A swirl that started weak probably stretched high into the air and strengthened, which would make it the equivalent of a landspout. That\u2019s the closest cousin of a tornado. Regardless, it was powerful enough to whip leaves, trees and building supplies into its circulation.\n\nRead more\n\nCaught in the inferno: How the Camp Fire overwhelmed Paradise\n\nApocalyptic images show the unfathomable devastation caused by California\u2019s deadly Camp Fire\n\nThe weather and climate behind the California infernos that wrecked Paradise and torched Malibu", "Can you copyright a taste?\n\nThat was the question before the Court of Justice of the European Union, which was asked to determine whether a Dutch company could claim exclusive rights to its spreadable cheese.\n\nOn Tuesday, the court offered its resounding answer: No.\n\nTaste is \u201can idea,\u201d the court ruled. It\u2019s not an \u201cexpression of an original intellectual creation,\u201d and therefore it can\u2019t be protected by the law.\n\nThe case was brought five years ago by the Dutch company Levola. Levola has sold Heks\u2019nkaas (which translates to Witches' Cheese), a silky white cheese, since 2001. It\u2019s a mix of cream cheese, parsley, garlic and leeks. In 2013, rival company Smilde began crafting a spread called Witte Wievenkaas, which also references witches. The product included many of the same ingredients.\n\nLevola said something didn\u2019t smell right, accusing Smilde of copying its product.\n\nBut the Court of Justice was not convinced, saying that only \u201coriginal intellectual creation\u201d is eligible for a copyright.\n\nThe \u201csubject matter protected by copyright must be expressed in a manner which makes it identifiable with sufficient precision and objectivity,\u201d the court said, such as a book, a television show or a piece of art. \u201cIn that regard, the Court finds that the taste of a food product cannot be identified with precision and objectivity.\u201d\n\nThe court said that taste is subjective, and that different people experience food differently. Therefore, a taste is not the same thing as, say, a movie or book, which is immutable. Tastes \u201cdepend on, amongst other things, factors particular to the person tasting the product concerned, such as age, food preferences and consumption habits, as well as on the environment or context in which the product is consumed,\u201d the court said.\n\nThe lawsuit isn\u2019t quite as crazy as it sounds. In 2006, the Dutch courts ruled that Lancome could copyright the smell of its perfumes. (In 2013, French courts found the opposite.)\n\nEuropean intellectual property lawyer Joshua Marshall told the New York Times that the ruling made sense. \u201cCopyright isn\u2019t supposed to be used to stop the spread and use of ideas,\u201d he said. \u201cThe taste of a leek-and-garlic cheese is really an idea.\u201d", "Deputy National Security Adviser Mira Ricardel, right, watches as President Donald Trump arrives for a Diwali ceremonial lighting of the Diya in the Roosevelt Room of the White House, Tuesday, Nov. 13, 2018, in Washington.

Frequently, they name technology as the single biggest change in their kids\u2019 lives\u2014and in their own lives, too. Many parents go on to say that their children are on screens more than they want them to be, and that screen use is often a source of con\ufb02ict with their children. Many express uncertainty about however they are letting their kids use screens, and a sense that they might be doing it \u201cwrong.\u201d I\u2019m hoping that the ideas in this report will resonate in a positive way for readers by providing some helpful new information and support on this challenging topic \u2014 that\u2019s my goal in writing this. Nancy Carlsson-Paige, early-childhood expert and author\n\nThat\u2019s the start of a new primer for parents about raising young children in the digital age at a time when research on how media affects brain development is still not clear.\n\n\u201cYoung Children in the Digital Age: A Parent\u2019s Guide,\u201d was written by Nancy Carlsson-Paige, an early-childhood education expert, who has spent decades advocating for allowing young children learn through play. As she writes in the primer:\n\nA child\u2019s whole development, brain development included, is best supported when young kids have full-on opportunities to use their whole bodies and senses for activity, play, and social interaction.\n\nHowever, for well over a decade, school reforms that have concentrated on using student standardized test scores to evaluate children, teachers and/or schools have led to a reduction \u2014 and sometimes elimination \u2014 of play-based learning in the earliest grades and a concentration instead on academics. Along with that focus is a growth in the use of computers, tablets and other screen-based tools for increasingly younger students to use to learn.\n\nResearch is anything but definitive on how screen time affects brain development in young people, though the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that for children younger than 18 months, parents avoid the use of screen media other than to video chat.\n\nIt also recommends that parents of children 18 to 24 months of age who want to introduce digital media should choose high-quality programming, and watch it with their children to help them understand what they\u2019re seeing. And for children ages 2 to 5 years, the recommendation is that screen time be limited to one hour per day of high-quality programs.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. government just released new guidelines for physical activity for Americans of all ages, saying:\n\nPreschool-aged children (ages 3 through 5 years) should be physically active throughout the day to enhance growth and development. Adult caregivers of preschool-aged children should encourage active play that includes a variety of activity types.\n\nCarlsson-Paige is a professor emerita of education at Lesley University in Cambridge, Mass., where she prepared teachers for more than 30 years and was a founder of the university\u2019s Center for Peaceable Schools.\n\nShe is also the author of \u201cTaking Back Childhood\u201d and a founding member of a nonprofit called Defending the Early Years, which commissions research about early-childhood education and advocates sane policies for young children. The mother of actor Matt Damon and artist Kyle Damon, she is the recipient of numerous awards, including the Legacy Award from the Robert F. Kennedy Children\u2019s Action Corps for work over several decades on behalf of children and families.\n\n[Early childhood education expert: I saw a brilliant way to teach kids. Unfortunately it wasn\u2019t in the United States.]\n\nThe primer, published by Defending the Early Years, discusses six core ideas about child development. The following comes from the report:\n\n1) Young children use their whole bodies and all of their senses to learn about the world.\n\nUnfortunately, there is a dearth of speci\ufb01c research about how media use affects brain development. But what we do know is that the experiences a child has shape brain development. As the child moves, interacts, and uses her senses, neural activity in the brain is stimulated. One neuroscientist wrote, \u201cYou hold him on your lap and talk \u2026 and neurons from his ears start hard-wiring connections to the auditory cortex. And you thought you were just playing with your kid.\u201d A child\u2019s whole development, brain development included, is best supported when young kids have full-on opportunities to use their whole bodies and senses for activity, play, and social interaction.\n\n2) Young children learn from direct, firsthand experience in the real world.\n\nWhen a child looks at a screen, not only is she more passive, but also her attention shifts away from her own initiative. ... Presenting a child with images on a 2-D screen short changes a child by giving her far too little to go on, too little information on which to build concepts needed in order to build the foundation for later learning.\n\n3) Young children learn by inventing ideas.\n\nChildren don\u2019t learn optimally when we try to put information into their heads directly. Most of us probably remember having to learn some things by rote when we were in school. And most of us probably know that we forgot what we learned quite quickly. For genuine learning to happen, kids need to construct ideas for themselves, in their own minds. This is the kind of learning that is real and genuine and stays with us.\n\n4) Young children make sense of their world through play.\n\nBecause play is such a vital resource for healthy development, it is worrisome to observe the significant decline in children\u2019s play today. Children are now playing less both at home and in school.\n\n5) Young children learn inner resilience and coping skills through play.\n\nGiving kids undefined materials allows them to reach inward to create the props and symbols they need to get the most out of their play. This can\u2019t happen when we give them defined toys or screen apps or games because the images are pre-set. They determine what happens in the play and impede a child from accessing his or her own imagination and emotional needs.\n\n6) Children live and learn in a context of social relationships.\n\nToday, the context in which children are developing socially and emotionally is changing rapidly and dramatically. Children are playing less both in school and at home and therefore, have less experience interacting with other kids. And it seems, judging from the research, that many children have less time or less focused time with parents. Many parents are less available to children because of time spent with technology. Because child development theory would tell us that children need lots of social interaction for healthy development, it is a concern that they are getting less of it today.\n\n[How \u2018twisted\u2019 early childhood education has become \u2014 from a child development expert]\n\nHere\u2019s the full report:", "\n\nResidents speak up at a Baraboo School Board meeting on Monday after a photo of Nazi-saluting students went viral.

The Baraboo School District is a hate-free environment.\u201d\n\nIf this response sounds familiar, it\u2019s because it echoes the bland assurances recited by officials whenever poison bubbles up in America.\n\n\u201cHate is not an American value,\u201d said then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, following the deadly 2017 white-supremacist rally in Charlottesville. \u201cAmerica is better than this,\u201d wrote Joe Biden on Facebook this summer, in response to migrant children being separated from their families. \u201cThis type of hate has no home here,\u201d insisted a New Hampshire alderman just this weekend after a public gazebo was desecrated with swastikas.\n\nIn response to various acts of racism, sexism, bigotry and violence, President Barack Obama used the phrase \u201cThat\u2019s not who we are\u201d so often \u2014 at least 46 times, as compiled in one video montage \u2014 that it had the unintended result of upending his assertion. Maybe that\u2019s exactly who we are: a country that is frequently racist, sexist, bigoted and violent.\n\nSo, to the Baraboo superintendent: If your defense is, \u201cWe\u2019re a hate-free environment,\u201d but there\u2019s a photo of 60 of your students Sieg Heil-ing on the steps of the county courthouse, then maybe you should consider the possibility that you are, in fact, a hate-filled environment.\n\nYou should also consider the possibility that a useful response wouldn\u2019t be to deny it but rather to interrogate it. Maybe something like: Our students did an awful thing. We\u2019re trying to figure out why, and how we can have the conversations to help make sure they never want to do it again.\n\nIn the photo, only one boy seems visibly uncomfortable with the jovial salute happening around him. His name is Jordan Blue, and he stands in the top-right corner of the photograph, a combination of anxious and horrified. He explained to a journalist on Monday that he would have left the photo if there\u2019d been time to step away.\n\nBlue also provided a little context: \u201cThese classmates have been bullying me since middle school,\u201d he said. \u201cI have struggled with it my whole life and nothing has changed. These are the boy[s] of the Class of 2019.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t specify whether there was a nature to the bullying \u2014 if he\u2019s Jewish, or gay, or nerdy, or any number of identities that adolescents have often turned into targets \u2014 but it hardly matters. In a separate interview, Blue suggested that his classmates saw the sieg heil as a joke, which may well be the case. Still, what he described made it sound like this kind of callous attitude wasn\u2019t an isolated incident at Baraboo. It wasn\u2019t a wart on an otherwise unblemished student body but part of the central nervous system.\n\n(The last time Baraboo was in the national news, it was because students at this school 300 miles north of the Mason-Dixon Line were driving around with Confederate flags on their cars. A tribute, they said, to a deceased classmate.)\n\nOf course, this isn\u2019t just about 60 high school students in Baraboo. A 2005 poll found that over half of Americans didn\u2019t know or responded incorrectly when asked what Auschwitz, Dachau and Treblinka were.\n\nDiscrimination is baked into the country\u2019s DNA, from founders supporting the enslavement of black people, to police beating women who were marching for the right to vote in 1917, to 1980s politicians choosing to ignore a fatal epidemic because most of the victims appeared to be gay men.\n\nThe shame over an incident like Baraboo\u2019s shouldn\u2019t be merely over the fact that it happened. It should be felt over the fact that when it happens, we pretend like nobody could have seen it coming.\n\nIf anything makes our country worthy of pride, it\u2019s the fact that in the grand sweep of history, we do try to put events like those in the past tense. We pass better laws, elect different people, expand human rights instead of contract them.\n\nFor that to happen, though, we need to clearly and loudly and without excuses diagnose the problem: This is who we are. Now let\u2019s try to make it who we were.\n\nMonica Hesse is a columnist writing about gender and its impact on society.

The unusual lawsuit, an escalation of Trump\u2019s long-running war of words with CNN, seeks a judge\u2019s intervention after Trump banished Acosta from the White House grounds for an indefinite period after a brief altercation between Acosta and a White House press aide. \u2026 CNN filed suit in U.S. District Court in Washington. \u201cWe have asked this court for an immediate restraining order requiring the pass be returned to Jim, and will seek permanent relief as part of this process,\u201d the network said in a statement released Tuesday morning.\n\nOne lawyer for CNN is the highly respected Ted Olson, former solicitor general under George W. Bush. The lawsuit alleges that the content of Acosta\u2019s reporting, not the phony allegation that Acosta \u201cplace[d] his hands on the intern,\u201d was the reason his \u201chard pass\u201d was pulled. As a result, the lawsuit argues, he was irreparably harmed and therefore requires injunctive relief to continue reporting. The complaint also alleges violation of the Fifth Amendment\u2019s due process protections and the Administrative Procedure Act, because Trump acted arbitrarily and capriciously.\n\nThe lawsuit is very likely to succeed. \u201cThe White House cannot constitutionally exclude a reporter from press briefings because the reporter or his employer has criticized the President or his aides,\u201d Geoffrey Stone, Chicago Law School professor and one of the leading constitutional scholars in the country, tells me. \u201cSuch an action would clearly violate the First Amendment. Although the White House can limit the number of reporters who can attend such events, it cannot exclude a reporter to punish him for his or his employer\u2019s critical comments about the President.\u201d\n\nThe legal ground for this suit was plowed by an earlier action filed by Protect Democracy on behalf of the writers\u2019 group PEN America. The PEN lawsuit\u2019s legal theory, namely that Trump\u2019s use of the powers of his office to curb criticism violates the First Amendment, postulates that his actions have a chilling effect on other journalists. The Acosta lawsuit is the perfect example of this. By pulling Acosta\u2019s credentials, Trump signaled to other members of the media that they, too, are at risk if they ask tough questions or are insufficiently deferential toward Trump. Indeed, Trump ominously hinted that he would consider pulling other journalists\u2019 credentials.\n\nProtect Democracy\u2019s executive director Ian Bassin applauded the suit:\n\nImportant suit from @cnn over White House\u2019s unconstitutional retaliation against @Acosta. This is not the only retaliatory act Trump has taken in violation of #1A, as our suit w @PENamerican on which CNN\u2019s suit builds lays out: https://t.co/RCheQM7S72 https://t.co/9J0NW2zH8f \u2014 Ian Bassin (@ianbassin) November 13, 2018\n\nThat any lawsuits had to be filed at all should illustrate how abnormally and outrageously this administration behaves. No other administration has branded the media \u201cthe enemy of the people,\u201d turned crowds into a hissing and chanting mob gesticulating at the media and/or threatened to pull the license of a network.\n\nEven if the White House relents and returns Acosta\u2019s \u201chard pass,\u201d CNN and others have an interest in preventing the administration from doing it again. It is the fear of losing one\u2019s ability to cover the White House critically that is the essence of Trump\u2019s unconstitutional efforts to chill the press.\n\nThere is concern, rightfully so, that the media not \u201cmake it all about them,\u201d which only fuels the Trumpian argument that the media is biased against him. However, by filing the lawsuit, CNN allows its reporters to do their jobs; the controversy is directed to the courts, not to the White House briefing room. If it takes a court ruling to force Trump to respect the First Amendment and uphold his oath to protect and defend the Constitution, so be it.\n\nRead more:\n\nWhat Democrats\u2019 big win in Arizona means\n\nHow to lose in 2020 if you are a Republican\n\nThree options for conscientious Republicans (or ex-Republicans)", "Last year, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tweeted that Canada welcomed \u201cthose fleeing persecution, terror & war.\u201d It was widely seen as a repudiation of President Trump\u2019s travel ban targeting mostly Muslim countries.\n\nTo those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith.

Two years ago, 20 state and local air regulators, backed by public health groups, petitioned the agency to revamp its regulations of NOx, citing adverse effects on health and air quality.\n\nAt the time, the agency agreed changes were necessary, \u201cparticularly in areas of the country with elevated levels of air pollution.\u201d Obama administration officials said they planned to work with states such as California, the industry and others toward creating an updated national set of standards.\n\nOn Tuesday, the EPA appeared to be carrying on that work to scale back emissions of the poisonous gas, which forms when fuel is burned at high temperatures. The agency did not issue a specific proposal \u2014 that is unlikely to come until 2020 \u2014 but officials said they plan to begin a formal rulemaking process for what they called the Cleaner Trucks Initiative.\n\n\u201cThis initiative will help modernize heavy-duty truck engines, improving their efficiency and providing cleaner air for all Americans,\u201d EPA acting administrator Andrew Wheeler said in a call with reporters. \u201cWe are under no regulatory or court order requirements to launch this initiative. We are doing it because it\u2019s good for the environment.\u201d\n\nEnvironmental advocates, who have fiercely opposed the administration\u2019s efforts to roll back dozens of Obama-era regulations, including those aimed at combating climate change, reacted to Tuesday\u2019s news with cautious optimism.\n\n\u201cThis is a positive step and may be the first thing this EPA has done that will actually reduce air pollution,\u201d said Paul Billings, senior vice president for public policy at the American Lung Association.\n\nEven California officials, who have clashed with the administration over its proposal to freeze fuel-efficiency standards for the nation\u2019s cars and light trucks, seemed encouraged by Tuesday\u2019s announcement.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good that they are moving forward, because heavy-duty NOx is a huge problem, both as a precursor to ozone and fine particles,\u201d Stanley Young, spokesman for the California Air Resources Board, said in an email. \u201cCARB petitioned EPA to begin this process, as have many other state and local agencies, so we are pleased that the agency is moving forward to address the next generation of new heavy-duty engines.\u201d\n\nCalifornia regulators have begun a public process to set new state emissions limits, with a proposal likely next year.\n\nIndustry groups also welcomed the EPA\u2019s announcement.\n\n\u201cThis new initiative sets the next chapter for diesel technology,\u201d said Allen Schaeffer, executive director of the Diesel Technology Forum, which represents engine manufacturers and suppliers. He said the effort probably will result in cleaner engines that perform better, last longer and improve air quality. \u201cIt\u2019s the beginning of a journey, but I think a good one.\u201d\n\nTuesday\u2019s push for tighter tailpipe pollution standards for heavy-duty trucks seems at odds with the deregulatory push that has defined the Trump administration. Even as he announced the initiative on a call with reporters, Wheeler boasted about the more than two dozen regulatory rollbacks the agency has set in motion, while noting greenhouse gas emissions from major industrial sources have fallen slightly in recent years.\n\n\u201cThe Trump administration has proven that burdensome federal regulations are not necessary to drive environmental progress,\u201d he said.\n\nSince the Trump administration took office, the EPA has sought to undo Obama-era regulations to limit methane emissions, reduce carbon dioxide emissions from power plants, reconsider rules governing the disposal of coal waste and slow requirements to make passenger cars more efficient.\n\nUnder then-Administrator Scott Pruitt, the EPA last year also proposed repealing tighter emissions standards for \u201cglider\u201d trucks, which use older engines that emit dozens of times as much soot and contaminants as newer ones. The agency later backed off the proposal, though it has not made a final decision.\n\nBill Wehrum, head of the EPA\u2019s Office of Air and Radiation, took issue with the notion that Tuesday\u2019s announcement was one of the few actions the Trump EPA had taken to actually combat air pollution.\n\n\u201cWe have moved forward with a series of very important rulemakings,\u201d Wehrum told reporters, \u201cand the goal of every single one of them is to try to reduce emissions, but to do it in the smartest way possible and most efficient way possible and most cost-effective way possible.\u201d", "Rep. Cheri Bustos (D-Ill.) is seeking to become chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the caucus\u2019s political arm that will be tasked with defending the majority in 2020. (Sarah Silbiger/CQ Roll Call/AP)\n\nDemocrats laid the foundation for their midterm victory in the suburban districts that Hillary Clinton won two years ago, but the true margin of their House majority came in districts that traditionally tilt right.\n\nAlmost half the 30-plus seats Democrats won came in Republican-held districts where President Trump prevailed in 2016, and with ballots still being counted in several more races, that share might grow.\n\nMoreover, combined with the seats they already held in Trump territory, Democrats are on track to start the new Congress in January holding about 30 districts where the president won.\n\nThat\u2019s a large degree of political exposure, given that the size of their House majority will be about half that when the final races are called, and it\u2019s a dynamic that has already prompted a debate within the party about the direction Democrats should chart over the next two years.\n\nThey now must decide how to govern: Go bold, brandishing an aggressive liberal agenda that tells voters what Democrats stand for and what to expect from their eventual presidential standard-bearer in 2020; or play it safe with a disciplined approach that doesn\u2019t scare off independent voters ahead of the battle for the White House.\n\nThe party\u2019s more liberal groups have already begun lobbying the Democratic leadership to push for a more aggressive agenda. The Progressive Change Institute built a database of Democratic candidates on a wide span of issues including the single-payer proposal for a national health plan built around Medicare and candidates\u2019 stances on corporate PAC donations.\n\nAlmost 65 percent of the incoming freshman class of House Democrats supports Medicare-for-all, expanding Medicare or expanding Social Security, according to the liberal nonprofit group, which considers those three positions the \u201ctip of the spear\u201d for economic progressives.\n\nBut in a familiar refrain from internal debates of the past 30 years, some Democrats fear that an agenda that is too aggressive will scare off some of the independent voters who broke heavily in their direction this fall, endangering both the 2020 presidential nominee and the dozens of incumbents running two years from now in Trump-leaning districts.\n\n\u201cFor Democrats to maintain and expand this near-majority advantage, they must craft a broadly appealing agenda that brings or keeps independents and less-committed partisans \u2014 the majority of whom call themselves \u2018moderate\u2019 \u2014 under the tent,\u201d Anne Kim and Will Marshall of the Progressive Policy Institute wrote in a study released this week.\n\nIn an election-eve survey conducted with Expedition Strategies, they found that 48 percent of voters considered themselves to be Democrats or independents who lean Democratic, a comfortable distance ahead of the 39 percent of voters labeling themselves Republicans or centrists who lean Republican.\n\nOverall, 51 percent of voters considered themselves \u201cweak partisans,\u201d including 31 percent who call themselves independent. Kim and Marshall assert that these voters are the decisive set who will determine the long-term direction of the country in the presidential election.\n\n\u201cThe next two years present a do-or-die chance for progressive leaders to build upon and solidify their governing majority in Congress and, potentially, to recapture the White House,\u201d they wrote.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) faces opposition from some Democrats in her bid to become speaker again, but the objectors are either veteran incumbents who have had personal disputes with her or hail from the incoming class of mostly younger candidates who are largely in favor of a new generation of leadership taking the reins.\n\nPelosi, who has no announced opponent, has signaled that the opening weeks of next year would be focused on many of the kitchen-table issues on which Democrats campaigned, such as lowering the cost of prescription drugs and reasserting the guarantees prohibiting insurers from driving up costs because of individuals\u2019 preexisting medical conditions.\n\nThe question is where the party goes after that, how boldly, how liberally.\n\nThis issue has ripened in the race for chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the caucus\u2019s political arm that will be tasked with defending the majority in 2020.\n\nRep. Cheri Bustos (D) has made the fact that her western Illinois district narrowly voted for Trump in 2016 a hallmark of her DCCC bid, suggesting that she knows what the Democrats who won in Trump-leaning Districts will be going through in 2020.\n\nDemocrats have some degree of history on their side.\n\nNo House majority has changed hands during a presidential year since 1952, and the majority has not flipped in successive elections since 1954.\n\nBut these are not ordinary times, and Democrats have some seats that will be immediate Republican targets. At least 12 of those seats will be in districts that voted for the past three Republican presidential nominees, according to The Washington Post\u2019s Philip Bump.\n\nThis is unfamiliar territory for Democrats, whose past eight years in the House minority regularly meant that they had few seats to worry about.\n\nAfter the 2014 elections, Democrats fell to their smallest number of seats since just after World War II. They entered the Nov. 6 elections holding just 13 districts that Trump had won in 2016, losing three of them.\n\nTheir main targets initially were the 25 GOP-held seats that Clinton won in 2016, needing a 23-seat gain to claim the majority. They did very well in those districts \u2014 Democrats have won 18 of them so far, with a couple more likely to fall into their column once the vote counting ends.\n\nBut then Democrats pushed deeper into Trump territory, which gave them the majority and, with races being called day after day, enough of a cushion to think big about what they want to do with the chairmen\u2019s gavels and the House agenda.\n\nThey are likely to end up with around 233 seats, which was the exact number Democrats had at the start of 2007 when Pelosi first became leader.\n\nRead more from Paul Kane\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.", "\n\nRepublican Senate candidate Rick Scott speaks to supporters at an election watch party Nov. 7 in Naples, Fla.

This will be as the recount is still going on in Florida. \u2014 Sean Sullivan (@WaPoSean) November 12, 2018\n\nScott\u2019s attendance on Capitol Hill this week is without recent precedent.\n\nThat\u2019s mainly because statewide election recounts are extremely rare. Of the 4,687 statewide general elections held between 2000 and 2015, just 27 were followed by a recount, and only three were Senate races, according to data compiled by the nonpartisan FairVote.\n\nTwo of those three Senate races produced a new senator like Scott.\n\nThe 2000 Senate race in Washington went through a recount before Democrat Maria Cantwell was deemed the winner, ousting an 18-year GOP incumbent by a mere 2,229 votes. By the time the freshman orientation was held in early December, the recount had finished and she was the senator-elect, according to news reports at the time.\n\nBut in 2008, the Senate orientation was held before the winner in the Minnesota election had been determined. Sen. Al Franken (D) waited out the results and did not participate. He did go down to Washington and meet with Democratic leaders that same week, which was seen as presumptuous by Republicans, according to the Star Tribune.\n\nSo, Scott may be the first candidate, at least in recent memory, to attend an orientation as a senator-elect before actually being the senator-elect. (The Senate historian does not keep this information.)\n\nDavid O\u2019Brien, an attorney with FairVote, said he doesn\u2019t have a problem with a candidate getting prepped and being ready to go in the event they do win, but he said there is also an optics issue to consider.\n\nCritics of Scott have pounced on his attendance as premature and disrespectful of the arduous recount going on back in his state.\n\nO\u2019Brien said it is more common for House candidates in undecided races to attend freshman orientation \u2014 there\u2019s sure to be a handful of them there this week.\n\nBut it has its risks.\n\nOur colleague Paul Kane recalled that back in 2002, a Democratic candidate in a tight race in Colorado came to Washington for orientation and voted in the leadership election. Then-congressman, now-Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) beat Rep. Rosa L. DeLauro (D-Conn.) in a race for the House Democratic Caucus chairmanship by one vote.\n\nThat guy from Colorado voted for Menendez. He went on to lose his election and never served in Congress.", "JERUSALEM \u2014 A slew of grievances and major underlying issues have Israel and Hamas locked in a spiral of violence that has caused three wars in the last decade and repeated rounds of deadly fighting.\n\nWith an Israeli-Egyptian blockade, a riven Palestinian leadership and a militant Hamas, Gaza\u2019s predicament remains seemingly unsolvable.\n\nHere is a look at each side\u2019s demands and what is keeping them in conflict:\n\nHAMAS\n\nThe Islamic militant group has ruled Gaza since a violent 2007 takeover of the territory from forces loyal to the Western-backed President Mahmoud Abbas.\n\nHamas, which rose to global prominence with suicide bombings in the 1990s and 2000s that killed hundreds of Israelis, is sworn to Israel\u2019s destruction and has never accepted peace accords. It has set up a de facto government in the Gaza Strip, where it is responsible for managing the daily lives of some 2 million Palestinians.\n\nIsrael, which along with its Western allies considers Hamas a terrorist group, joined with Egypt to impose a blockade on Gaza after the Hamas takeover, eviscerating the local economy. Jobs are hard to come by, Gaza\u2019s beaches are polluted by untreated sewage and tap water is undrinkable.\n\nThe blockade greatly restricts the movement of people out of the tiny territory, making it difficult to do business or travel abroad for work, school or family reasons.\n\nHamas wants Israel and Egypt to lift the blockade and it has led weekly protests since March aimed at busting it. Fueled in part by desperation, thousands have attended, with some burning tires, throwing rocks and grenades at Israeli troops and damaging the perimeter fence. More than 170 protesters have been killed by Israeli fire since the protests began.\n\nIsrael says it is defending its border against attackers. But it has come under heavy international criticism for the large number of unarmed people who have been shot.\n\n___\n\nISRAEL\n\nIsrael, which withdrew from the Gaza Strip in 2005 after 38 years of occupation, says it has no choice but to enforce the blockade, accusing Hamas of trying to smuggle weapons into the territory.\n\nIsrael claims some credit for keeping border crossings open, allowing food, consumer goods and some construction materials to flow into the territory. It also has asked the international community, which already funnels hundreds of millions of dollars a year into Gaza, to increase aid.\n\nOver the years, Hamas has amassed a vast arsenal of rockets and other weapons which it has fired sporadically at Israeli communities along with other Gaza militants. Israel and Hamas have fought three wars, including one in 2014 that exposed a network of underground tunnels leading into Israel from Gaza, prompting Israeli accusations that Hamas uses material meant for Gaza\u2019s reconstruction for its war infrastructure.\n\nDespite its recognition that the economic situation in Gaza could lead to a humanitarian crisis, Israel says no political resolution can be reached so long as Hamas remains in power. Hamas has refused to disarm or disavow its opposition to Israel.\n\n___\n\nTHE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY\n\nCompounding the situation has been a yearslong rift between Hamas and Abbas\u2019 Fatah faction. Attempts to reconcile have repeatedly failed, leaving the Palestinians divided between rival governments in the West Bank and Gaza. The talks have repeatedly broken down over Hamas\u2019 refusal to disarm.\n\nAbbas is fearful of any political settlement that would separate Gaza from the West Bank and entrench Hamas rule.\n\nHe has slashed the salaries of thousands of former government workers in Gaza and cut fuel subsidies to pay for electricity, all in an effort to step up pressure on Hamas. He has also thwarted a series of internationally-backed initiatives aimed at rehabilitating Gaza, worried that they could help Hamas.\n\nThese measures, combined with the decade-long blockade, have sent Gaza\u2019s economy into freefall, prompting the increasingly desperate Hamas to step up the mass border protests.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Or is it just a dispute between a White House executive and a specific news organization?\n\nWhat is the law?\n\nThe First Amendment guarantees freedom of the press, meaning the government is barred from discriminating against viewpoint.\n\nUnder no circumstance can the White House revoke a reporter\u2019s access to open press briefings simply because it doesn\u2019t like that reporter\u2019s questions. However, the First Amendment does not guarantee all reporters the right to attend White House briefings. Whether the White House is justified in blocking a reporter\u2019s access is a determination made by a judge.\n\nFirst Amendment lawyer Floyd Abrams told The Washington Post that the Constitution doesn\u2019t allow content discrimination against journalists who publish things that a political figure disagrees with, or against reporters who ask difficult and probing questions of that official. That conduct is protected.\n\n\u201cIt cannot happen because of disagreement with a journalist about the content of his or her reporting. It cannot happen in an effort to retaliate because of prior reporting,\u201d Abrams said Tuesday.\n\nThere are situations where a journalist\u2019s access to a news conference can be effectively stripped, though they are rare, Abrams said. For example, if a journalist is an ongoing threat to people present in the area, the government has a legitimate argument to take away his or her access.\n\nCourts have never before seen a presidential administration bar a journalist for nonthreatening, but disruptive, behavior \u2014 as Sanders has alleged. But they could.\n\nIn this case, the court will come back to whether Acosta is being discriminated against because of the content of his speech or the quality of his behavior.\n\nWhat will CNN argue?\n\nThe media will occasionally bring First Amendment violation cases, typically when the lone reporter representing an outlet or the entire news organization itself is blocked.\n\nThat\u2019s not true here: CNN still has multiple reporters covering the White House. But Jameel Jaffer, director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, called the lawsuit \u201centirely justified\u201d and said CNN appears to have a strong case.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear from the factual record that the White House revoked Acosta\u2019s access because of the content of his questions. At the end of the day, that\u2019s enough to establish a First Amendment violation,\u201d Jaffer said.\n\nDespite the press secretary\u2019s original claim that Acosta placed his hands on an intern, several experts argued that the undoctored video evinced no excessive contact between the two. (Sanders, in supporting her claim, tweeted an apparently doctored video of the incident.)\n\nThe intern \u201cbumped into [Acosta] reaching for the microphone,\u201d Freedom Forum Institute President Gene Policinski said.\n\nStill, that contact probably provided the White House with bit of a rationale.\n\nPolicinski said that deliberate and repeated disruption could amount to a reasonable basis to block a reporter from attendance. But, he said, Acosta\u2019s questions were asked in a responsible way.\n\n\u201cJournalists attend press briefings to ask tough questions. Sometimes you\u2019ll ask a question that some people find repellent, but that comes with the territory. Nothing in the First Amendment says journalists must be polite,\u201d he said.\n\nWhat will the White House argue?\n\nThe case comes down to an individual reporter and his right to be there, according to Stuart Karle, former general counsel for the Wall Street Journal and the former chief operating officer of Reuters News.\n\n\u201cIf CNN was barred entirely, that would be problematic,\u201d said Karle, now an adjunct professor at Columbia Journalism School.\n\nThe White House should be granting press access to news organizations with broad audiences, but no one reporter has an absolute right to attend, Karle said.\n\nPresidential news conferences are events where reporters are expected to behave with a certain level of decorum. Failure to do so would be a reasonable basis to deny a press pass, Karle said. \u201cWhether Acosta behaves badly \u2014 worse than anyone else \u2014 is a factual question. The White House just needs to articulate a legitimate reason,\u201d he said.\n\nThe White House latched onto this notion, too, saying in a statement that CNN \u201chas nearly 50 additional hard pass holders, and Mr. Acosta is no more or less special than any other media outlet or reporter with respect to the First Amendment. . . . The White House cannot run an orderly and fair press conference when a reporter acts this way, which is neither appropriate nor professional. The First Amendment is not served when a single reporter, of more than 150 present, attempts to monopolize the floor.\"\n\nThe White House has broad authority about whom to call on and how many questions to take. Under other presidents, reporters have generally been limited to one question and possibly a related follow-up.\n\nAnd CNN still has White House credentials. Other reporters can cover the president and his administration. (Just two days after the Acosta-Trump flare-up, the president insulted CNN\u2019s Abby Phillip after she asked a question about acting attorney general Matthew G. Whitaker.)\n\nStill, said Abrams, the First Amendment expert: \u201cThe White House may not choose the identity of the journalist that CNN sends to a press conference. That\u2019s not a presidential prerogative.\u201d\n\nPaul Farhi contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:\n\nForeign countries are increasingly using Trump as a foil \u2014 or a punchline\n\nFlorida recount: Here\u2019s what you need to know.\n\nGOP\u2019s responses to the elections in Florida exacerbate concerns about voter suppression\n\nA reader\u2019s guide: 12 targets as House Democrats prepare to investigate the Trump administration", "Media critic\n\nCNN on Tuesday filed suit against top White House officials and the Secret Service for the revocation of chief White House correspondent Jim Acosta\u2019s hard pass to the White House following last Wednesday\u2019s testy post-election news conference with President Trump.

It must be torn apart. Here it is, annotated:\n\nWe have been advised that CNN has filed a complaint challenging the suspension of Jim Acosta\u2019s hard pass. This is just more grandstanding from CNN (1), and we will vigorously defend against this lawsuit. CNN, who has nearly 50 additional hard pass holders (2), and Mr. Acosta is no more or less special than any other media outlet or reporter with respect to the First Amendment. (3) After Mr. Acosta asked the President two questions \u2014 each of which the President answered \u2014 he physically refused to surrender a White House microphone to an intern (4), so that other reporters might ask their questions. This was not the first time this reporter has inappropriately refused to yield to other reporters. (5) The White House cannot run an orderly and fair press conference when a reporter acts this way, which is neither appropriate nor professional. The First Amendment is not served when a single reporter, of more than 150 present, attempts to monopolize the floor. If there is no check on this type of behavior it impedes the ability of the President, the White House staff, and members of the media to conduct business. (6)\n\nNotes:\n\n(1) \u201cGrandstanding\u201d: Here\u2019s some real grandstanding.\n\n(2) \u201cWho has nearly 50 additional hard pass holders\u201d: Time to amend the original CNN complaint in this case. With this little flourish, the White House appears to be suggesting that, hey, CNN doesn\u2019t need its chief White House correspondent \u2014 it can get along just fine with all those other pass-holders. Never has the White House voluntarily summed up its anti-mediaism in so few words.\n\n(3) \u201cNo more or less special than any other media outlet or reporter with respect to the First Amendment\u201d: A representative of the guy who has riffed about weakening libel protections and pulling the broadcast license of a unhelpful news outlet (something he can\u2019t do) is posturing as an arbiter of First Amendment protections.\n\n(4) \u201cHe physically refused to surrender a White House microphone to an intern\u201d: True. Acosta should have surrendered the microphone.\n\n(5) \u201cThis was not the first time this reporter has inappropriately refused to yield to other reporters.\u201d: In this sentence and its neighbors, Sanders appears terribly concerned about the ability of reporters to ask questions. Perhaps, then, she should bring back the daily White House press briefing.\n\n(6) An omission: Sanders appears to have bailed on a previous statement accusing Acosta of \u201cplacing his hands\u201d on an intern at last week\u2019s press conference who was attempting to retrieve a microphone. As the New York Times reported, Sanders relied on misleading video to lodge the allegation.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason why lawyers commonly insist that defendants in civil suits respond with short and boring statements, such as, We will vigorously fight this litigation.

(Ariel Schalit/Associated Press)\n\nASHKELON, Israel \u2014 Loren Amar was watching TV with her father around midnight when an air-raid siren warning of incoming rocket fire blared through their working-class neighborhood in southern Israel.\n\nTheir old apartment had no in-house shelter, so they huddled in the stairway just before a rocket from Gaza slammed into the building next-door, sending shrapnel and debris flying into their bedrooms \u2014 and the 29-year-old Amar to the hospital with shock symptoms.\n\n\u201cThe walls shook and the hallway filled with white smoke. It felt like an earthquake,\u201d she recalled Tuesday, a hospital identity tag still wrapped around her wrist. \u201cThe electricity went out and we didn\u2019t know whether to go up or down. I was hysterical.\u201d\n\nIt was the first lethal rocket attack from Gaza in years, and yet the only fatality was a Palestinian laborer from the West Bank. Two Israeli women were critically wounded.\n\nIn just 24 hours, Gaza militants fired more than 450 rockets and mortar shells into southern Israel, the most serious escalation since a 50-day war between Israel and Hamas in 2014. Israel responded with a wave of airstrikes it said targeted militants.\n\nResidents angrily demanded the government restore calm for good, even if that means another war. Yet many people wearily expressed a sense of helplessness, as successive governments fail to come up with an effective policy to bring quiet to the Israel-Gaza frontier.\n\nHamas militants seized Gaza in 2007, triggering an Israeli-Egyptian border blockade that has choked the territory of 2 million people. Israel refuses to lift the blockade unless Hamas disarms, a demand the militants refuse. The volatile standoff has produced repeated rounds of violence, including indiscriminate Gaza rocket fire at Israeli border towns.\n\nWord late Tuesday that Gaza militants agreed to a cease-fire was unlikely to sway people\u2019s minds that there is no long-term solution to the Gaza conundrum.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how you stop this thing. Nothing helps. Whatever you do it always comes back,\u201d said Shlomit Hayat, 38.\n\nShe noted that the deadly violence came just days after Israel allowed Qatar to deliver $15 million in cash to Gaza to alleviate its economic hardship and after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he\u2019d do everything he can to prevent an \u201cunnecessary\u201d war.\n\nThe latest fighting was triggered by a botched Israeli raid into Gaza on Sunday that set off clashes resulting in the deaths of seven Palestinian militants, including a local Hamas commander, and a senior Israeli military officer. Palestinian militant groups said the rocket barrage was a message to Israel that such incursions have a cost.\n\nGazans have similar fears when fighting breaks out. While Israel says it has confined its airstrikes to military targets, hundreds of Palestinian civilians have been killed in the three previous wars. For many in Gaza, the latest outbreak of fighting brought back fears that no place is truly safe in the densely populated territory.\n\nOn Tuesday, an Israeli airstrike destroyed a six-story residential building in the Rimal neighborhood of Gaza City that housed a kindergarten on its ground floor. Israel said the building was used by Hamas for military purposes \u2014 a charge denied by residents.\n\n\u201cAll the people here are civilians, children and families,\u201d said Mamdouh al-Shurafa, a building resident. \u201cWhen we are bombed in the middle of the city, where can we go?\u201d\n\nIsrael and Hamas have fought three wars since the group seized Gaza from the internationally-backed Palestinian Authority in 2007. In the most recent war, over 2,200 Palestinians were killed, more than half of them civilians, and tens of thousands were left homeless. Seventy-three people, most of them soldiers, were killed on the Israeli side.\n\nIsrael\u2019s Iron Dome rocket-defense system and advanced warning networks have provided a large degree of protection from the rockets, which killed some 30 civilians in the decade prior to the 2014 war. Casualties have dropped considerably since then and a proliferation of rocket-proof safe rooms in newer buildings has allowed many Israelis to feel much safer in their own homes.\n\nBut this week\u2019s onslaught showed the system is not foolproof. The overnight rocket that slipped through penetrated the roof of a four-story apartment building, leaving the entire structure pockmarked, its windows blown out and the balcony shutters hanging limply.\n\nEmergency forces evacuated a critically wounded woman to hospital. Only an hour later, a neighbor sifting through the rubble discovered the other wounded woman and the dead man. \u201cI heard a murmur and then I saw a hand reach out,\u201d said Shlomi Lankry.\n\nRelatives in the West Bank town of Halhoul identified the dead man as 48-year-old Mahmoud Abu Asbeh. A married father of six, he would typically sleep in Ashkelon during the week and return home for weekends.\n\n\u201cThe rockets don\u2019t have eyes to see, they hit randomly, and this happened randomly, it was unintentional,\u201d said his father, Abdel Hamid Abu Asbeh. \u201cLast night he told me the rockets are falling like rain. He said: \u2018May God protect us,\u2019 as if he expected something.\u201d\n\nThose around the building were at a loss to describe the shock of a rocket landing in the heart of their neighborhood.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like Russian Roulette,\u201d said Elie Mozes, 57. \u201cIt just comes out of nowhere.\u201d\n\nBack at home after her stint in the hospital, Amar said she was at a loss to prescribe a solution. With glass strewn across her bed and holes blown through her hanging laundry, she said all she knew was that something had to be done.\n\n\u201cIf anyone still lives in a fairytale that there will be peace here they need to snap out of it,\u201d she said.\n\n____\n\nAssociated Press writer Fares Akram in Gaza City contributed reporting.\n\n___\n\nFollow Heller at www.twitter.com/aronhellerap\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Paul White/Associated Press)\n\nMADRID \u2014 Real Madrid is done searching for a new coach.\n\nThe club said Tuesday it is sticking with Santiago Solari, giving him a permanent contract until June 2021.\n\nSolari was appointed as the interim coach about two weeks ago to replace the fired Julen Lopetegui and was rewarded with a long-term deal after leading the team to four straight victories, putting it back on track in the Spanish league and the Champions League.\n\nThe 42-year-old Solari is a former Argentina international who played for Real Madrid in the early 2000s. He had previously coached Madrid\u2019s \u201cB\u2019\u2019 team.\n\nThere had been speculation about Antonio Conte and Roberto Martinez as possible replacements for Lopetegui, but Solari gained the club\u2019s confidence \u2014 and the approval of fans and players \u2014 with his impressive start in charge of the main squad.\n\nMadrid outscored its opponents 15-2 in the four matches under Solari. It had lost five of its last seven games with Lopetegui in command, being outscored 13-4.\n\nSolari was virtually unknown outside of Spain and few saw him as a front-runner for the Madrid job, but he has always been well-regarded within the club.\n\nHe got the demanding Madrid fans on his side by making some popular choices early in his stint, including giving more playing time to Vinicius Junior, the young Brazilian who arrived amid high expectations but had been relegated to the \u201cB\u2019\u2019 team under Lopetegui. The 18-year-old forward played well every time Solari put him in, showing he was indeed ready to be with the main squad.\n\nPlayers who had been struggling under Lopetegui also began thriving after Solari took over. Karim Benzema was one of them, scoring four goals in the four victories under Solari. The French striker had scored only once in the last 10 matches before Lopetegui was fired.\n\nThe club had registered Solari as its permanent coach on Monday because local regulations prohibit teams from having an interim coach for more than two weeks.\n\nMadrid officials had been praising Solari but had not said they stopped looking for a full-time replacement for Lopetegui, the former Spain coach who was fired following a 5-1 loss to Barcelona at Camp Nou Stadium.\n\nThe club said the decision to keep Solari was made after a meeting of the board of directors on Tuesday.\n\nThe coach helped Madrid move from ninth to sixth in the Spanish league, four points behind Barcelona. He also put the three-time defending European champions back at the top of its group in the Champions League, tied on points with Roma.\n\nSolari helped Madrid win the 2002 Champions League as a player as was involved in the build-up that led to Zinedine Zidane\u2019s superb winner in the final.\n\nThe former midfielder also played for River Plate, Atletico Madrid and Inter Milan.\n\nHe had been coaching Real Madrid\u2019s \u201cB\u2019\u2019 team since 2016, taking over not long after Zidane left to coach the main squad.\n\nMadrid\u2019s next match is at Eibar in the Spanish league on Nov. 24, after the international break.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nTales Azzoni on Twitter: http://twitter.com/tazzoni\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

To follow are negotiations over Britain\u2019s future trade, security and economic relations with Europe \u2014 including side deals about immigration levels.\n\nFor the past two years, the greatest debate over Brexit has not been waged between Brussels and London, but within May\u2019s fractious Conservative Party, composed of \u201cleavers\u201d and \u201cremainers.\u201d\n\nHard-line Brexiteers have pushed for a decisive split from European bureaucrats and courts, from E.U. rules and regulations, while others, led by May, have sought a softer Brexit, a bundle of compromises that keep Britain more closely aligned with Europe, to better protect the British economy.\n\nOn Tuesday, arch-Brexiteer Boris Johnson, who quit his job as foreign secretary over May\u2019s proposals in July, told the BBC that he hoped the cabinet would \u201cchuck it out.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s vassal state stuff. For the first time in 1,000 years, this place, this Parliament will not have a say over the laws that govern this country,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nJohnson and his allies have said May\u2019s Brexit would leave Britain \u201ca rule taker\u201d vs. \u201ca rulemaker,\u201d subject to following Brussels laws for trade, without having much say in how they are written.\n\nThe leaders of Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which helps prop up May\u2019s minority government, sounded skeptical about the deal.\n\nSammy Wilson, the DUP\u2019s Brexit spokesman, told the BBC that they will be reading the agreement closely to ensure that Northern Ireland isn\u2019t treated differently from the rest of Britain. \u201cThe rumors we are hearing so far would indicate that that\u2019s not going to be the case,\u201d he said.\n\nDetails of the draft withdrawal were not released to the public Tuesday.\n\nHow to avoid the return to a hard border between Northern Ireland, which will remain in Britain, and the Republic of Ireland, which is a member of the E.U., has been one of the toughest issues facing the negotiators.\n\nThe Europeans have insisted that in the case that a future free-trade deal is not secured, Northern Ireland should remain in the European customs union. May has said that is not acceptable because it undercuts the sovereignty of Britain.\n\nMay has previously said that it would be either her withdrawal deal or no deal at all, which many think would trigger severe economic disruption. But some of her critics said there were more options to explore.\n\nThe leader of the Scottish National Party, Nicola Sturgeon, tweeted: \u201cIf the PM\u2019s \u2018deal\u2019 satisfies no-one and can\u2019t command a majority, we mustn\u2019t fall for her spin that the UK crashing out of EU without a deal is then inevitable \u2014 instead we should take the opportunity to get better options back on the table.\u201d\n\nMost lawmakers in the opposition Labour Party are expected to vote against the plan if and when it reaches Parliament. Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn said: \u201cWe will look at the details of what has been agreed when they are available. But from what we know of the shambolic handling of these negotiations, this is unlikely to be a good deal for the country.\u201d\n\nQuentin Ari\u00e8s in Brussels and Karla Adam in London contributed to this report.\n\nRead more\n\nBoris Johnson\u2019s family is in row over Brexit\n\nCould Brexit bring new troubles to Northern Ireland?\n\nHere are some of the \u2018no-deal Brexit\u2019 doomsday scenarios.\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "\n\nBarack Obama greets the crowd at a Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee rally on Sept. 8 in Anaheim, Calif. (Barbara Davidson/Getty Images)\n\nOpinion writer\n\nIt has been said that every senator looks in the mirror and sees a president. This year, it seems like every Democrat looks in the mirror and sees a president. But there\u2019s an endemic misunderstanding among Democrats about how they should go about picking the standard-bearer to take on President Trump in two years. There\u2019s a great deal of focus on what type of person they should nominate, when that might be the single least helpful question you could ask.\n\nBefore I explain why, here are some recent developments:\n\nSen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, who just won a comfortable reelection in a state that Democrats have increasing problems winning, said publicly that he\u2019s thinking about running for president.\n\nRichard Ojeda, a West Virginia state senator who just lost a bid for Congress (though by only 12 points in a district Donald Trump won by 49), has announced he is running for president.\n\nSen. Kirsten Gillibrand, asked on \u201cThe View\u201d on Monday whether she\u2019s running, replied, \u201cI\u2019m thinking about it.\u201d\n\nSteve Bullock, who is in his second and final term as governor of Montana, traveled to New York after the election to meet with potential donors for a presidential run.\n\nThat\u2019s not to mention the work that continues to be done by other likely candidates such as Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and Bernie Sanders; or the potential candidacies of Deval Patrick, Eric Holder, Joe Biden, Mitch Landrieu, John Hickenlooper and Terry McAuliffe; or the people who are getting encouraged to run but haven\u2019t said much about it such as Beto O\u2019Rourke and Amy Klobuchar; or the other announced candidate, John Delaney. It\u2019s a big field.\n\nBut as we begin to examine these potential candidates, we inevitably slip into a discussion not about the particular person we\u2019re talking about but about the broader type they\u2019re supposed to represent. Brown should run, some say, because Democrats need to put up a Rust Belt populist who connects with working-class voters. Or someone like Warren is compelling because women just propelled Democrats to a historic win and because a woman can effectively contrast with Trump. Or they shouldn\u2019t nominate a woman at all because rampant misogyny will hamper her.\n\nThe problem with all those arguments is that we don\u2019t elect types of people; we elect particular people. Imagine that in 2006 you had said, \u201cWhat Democrats need to do is nominate an African American from a big city with brief national experience, and oh yeah, it would help if he had an Arabic middle name.\u201d That would have been ridiculous. But the person they nominated, and who won two elections with a majority of the vote (something only one other president in the last half-century accomplished), wasn\u2019t just a candidate matching that description. He was Barack Obama, someone of unusual talent and charisma.\n\nDon\u2019t forget, at this stage of the 2008 process there was a lot of skepticism within the Democratic Party about Obama. Sure, he gave a great speech and he seemed to have a bright future, but most Democrats thought him running for president was premature. Even most African Americans in Congress were reluctant to back him until he won the Iowa caucuses and it became apparent he had a real shot to beat Hillary Clinton. But Democrats flocked to him because of how he made them feel, not because they thought other people would vote for him in the general election. You could say something similar about what happened with Trump and the Republicans in 2016.\n\nThe idea that other people will support this candidate and therefore I\u2019ll support him is at the heart of \u201celectability,\u201d which is what a lot of these discussions come down to. Primary voters (and pundits) who care about it are putting aside their own feelings and judgments about a candidate to make a guess about how others will feel about her and judge her. But while successful candidates always look electable in hindsight, it\u2019s usually a mistake to concern yourself too much with it during the primaries (or the pre-pre-primaries, where we are now).\n\nThat\u2019s because the earlier we are in the process, the less we know both about how the general electorate will respond to a particular candidate and how good a candidate that person is. It can\u2019t be said often enough: Until they\u2019re tested in the unique arena of the presidential campaign, we don\u2019t know what all these people are made of. Primaries are littered with failed candidates who looked strong before the campaign actually began but then turned out to be duds.\n\nDemocrats have to decide exactly what they believe, what they want to do and how to go about it \u2014 and most importantly, who they are. The person who wins their nomination will be one who embodies the party\u2019s spirit at this moment in history, just as Obama did in 2008. One of these many candidates will prove to be that person; we just have no idea yet which one.\n\nRead more:\n\nJust how far will Republicans go to win?\n\nAccountability is finally coming to the Trump administration.

(Jim Havard)\n\nIt\u2019s only the second week of November, and we\u2019re already talking about snow. A wintry mix is in the forecast for Thursday morning, and snow could coat the grass in the D.C. metro area and accumulate up to two inches in the higher-elevation suburbs.\n\nIt seems strange and unlike the Novembers I\u2019ve come to expect here, so I asked Ian Livingston, our resident climatologist, about the history of snow in November. His answer was pretty much what I expected.\n\n\u201cThere really isn\u2019t much of one,\u201d he said, \u201calthough the north and west suburbs get a little from time to time.\u201d\n\nMeasurable November snow hasn\u2019t fallen in Washington in more than two decades. The last time it snowed enough to measure was 1996, and even then it was just two-tenths of an inch \u2014 barely enough to register on a yardstick.\n\n\n\n(The Washington Post Staff/Washington, D.C.)\n\nThat\u2019s not to say snowflakes are rare in November, they just don\u2019t tend to accumulate enough to measure. The last time we saw snow in the air in November was 2014 during a storm similar to what we have in the forecast this week; the National Weather Service had a winter storm warning up in the far-northern and western suburbs, and a winter weather advisory in the immediate northern and western suburbs. Although Dulles ended up with 1.3 inches from that storm, there wasn\u2019t enough snow to measure beyond a \u201ctrace\u201d at Reagan National Airport.\n\nIn fact, Washington has measured November snow more than 50 times since records began in 1871. Washington\u2019s average November snowfall is half an inch \u2014 the product of many Novembers with no accumulation punctuated by significant winter storms.\n\nThe top November snowfall records in the capital are more than three decades old at least, with the largest being a surprise storm in 1987, better known now as the Veterans Day Storm. The night before, forecasts called for up to an inch of wet snow. Some forecasters were predicting that it would be nothing but rain. \u201cJust two days before, it had been nearly 70 degrees,\u201d Jason Samenow wrote. \u201cThe air wasn\u2019t cold enough for much snow, forecasters said, and the ground was too warm for much to stick.\u201d\n\nThose forecasts were very, very wrong. The next morning, snow was falling at a rate of three inches per hour with thunder and lightning. The storm was crippling. By the time it was over, nearly a foot of snow had accumulated in the capital.\n\n\n\n(The Washington Post Staff/Washington, D.C.)\n\nThe earliest snow measured in Washington was Oct. 10, 1979. A frigid rain fell the night before, postponing the first game of the World Series at Memorial Stadium, where the Orioles were scheduled to take on the Pittsburgh Pirates.\n\nThe next morning, rain turned to wet, heavy snow. In Washington and Baltimore, 0.3 inches fell, but totals up to seven inches were reported in the northern and western suburbs. Dulles recorded 1.3 inches. \u201cThe tree damage was especially severe because the trees had not yet lost their leaves, allowing huge amounts of snow to accumulate on the branches,\u201d the Capital Weather Gang\u2019s Kevin Ambrose wrote in his book, \u201cWashington Weather.\u201d \u201cHuge snowflakes were accompanied by lightning and thunder.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nEverything you ever wanted to know about snow in Washington\n\nWashington\u2019s top 5 surprise snow storms\n\nA Veterans Day snowstorm totally fooled forecasters 30 years ago\n\nThe meteorology behind the November 2014 winter storm\n\nA map of the average first day of snow in the D.C. area", "\n\nTallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, the Democratic nominee for Florida governor, holds his son Davis as he greats supporters on Nov. 6 after voting in the midterm election. (Dan Anderson/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)\n\nIt\u2019s rare that political writers are handed as tidy an anecdote as the Republican response to Mitt Romney\u2019s loss in 2012. You\u2019ve heard this before, over and over: Romney lost, catching many by surprise. The GOP engaged in some introspection, determining that one necessary change was to make a greater effort to appeal to younger and nonwhite voters. It\u2019s an anecdote that comes up a lot when talking about the interplay of the nation\u2019s shifting diversity: As whites make up a smaller percentage of the population, the natural assumption is that Republicans will face tougher electoral prospects, given that nonwhites lean more heavily Democratic.\n\nBut then there are two counterexamples worth noting. The first is that, although the percentage of the electorate that is non-Hispanic white has been dropping over time, that hasn\u2019t meant that Democrats broadly are seeing more success. The 2008 election which ushered Barack Obama into the White House had about the same density of white voters as the 2014 election, in which Obama\u2019s Democratic Party got clobbered.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nLower still was the nonwhite percentage of the electorate in 2016 \u2014 an election in which Hillary Clinton won the popular vote but lost the electoral vote. Donald Trump\u2019s victory was predicated not on making headway on the demographic issues the GOP had identified four years earlier, but on casting those changes in sharply negative terms to energize Republican voters who were concerned, explicitly or implicitly, about the changing composition of the country.\n\nIt raises an interesting question: What is the relationship between changes in a state\u2019s demographics and how it votes? Our answer is a broadly unhelpful one: It depends.\n\nTo get to an answer, we pulled two sets of data. The first was demographic data by state from 1990 to 2017, the most recent year for which such information was available. That data allowed us to determine the percentage of non-Hispanic whites (whom we\u2019ll refer to more simply as \u201cwhites\u201d from here on out) in each state over time. Then, we compiled data on gubernatorial and senatorial races in each state from 1990 to 2018, using data from the U.S. Election Atlas. (We excluded races with major independent candidates and those pitting two candidates from the same party against each other.) We averaged those vote margins into four groups \u2014 1990 to 1994, 1995 to 2004, 2005 to 2014 and 2015 to 2018 \u2014 to compare the change in the vote with the change in the density of the white population in each state.\n\nIf there were a clear link between increasing diversity (that is, a decline in the density of whites in a state) and Democratic success, we\u2019d expect to see drops in the density of the white population generally correlate to shifts toward the Democrats over time.\n\nBut that\u2019s not generally what\u2019s seen. Comparing the latter three time periods with the baseline of 1990 to 1994, here\u2019s how each state\u2019s demographics and voting changed in the subsequent three periods. States with blue backgrounds had drops in the density of the white population and ended up voting more heavily Democratic. States with red backgrounds also had a lower density of whites \u2014 but voted more Republican.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nSome of the shifts, such as North Dakota, are significant. Some are subtle. Some mirror the change in demographics neatly (like California). Some are a mirror image, as in Utah. In fact, Utah had the strongest correlation between its change in diversity and its change in how it voted over those four periods \u2014 a strong inverse correlation.\n\nWe can look at this another way, showing how each state\u2019s racial demographics and voting habits changed over time. This is messy, but notice generally the color of arrows and the vertical axis, which goes from more-heavily white to less-heavily white from top to bottom.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nYou\u2019ll notice first that most of the least-heavily white states are also ones with blue arrows, meaning that, from 1990 to 1994, they\u2019ve voted more heavily Democratic. That includes two states that are still red but (as demonstrated last week) have gotten bluer: Arizona and Texas.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nThis is the warning that Republicans issued in 2012: Texas getting more blue is not a helpful outcome for the party.\n\nBut there are a lot more states that are less diverse and that have moved sharply to the right.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\n(Notice that Vermont, one of the least diverse states, is indicated at top. That\u2019s because the state has a Republican governor and an independent senator \u2014 and because we excluded races with independents, the state appears more Republican than it is.)\n\nUtah\u2019s move down and to the right is clear here. So is West Virginia\u2019s dramatic shift to the right over the past several decades. It\u2019s still on the more-Democratic side of the graph because it keeps electing Democrats as governor (although the Democratic governor wasted no time switching parties once elected).\n\nThat graph, too, doesn\u2019t tell the whole story. There are also a slew of states that remain mostly white but which have also gotten more Democratic over time. Most are blue states, but not all.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nOhio is interesting and worth pointing out here. You may have noticed on the map at the top of this article that some non-red (in the presidential-voting sense) states were identified as red anyway, such as Maryland and Massachusetts. Last week, both states reelected Republican governors. Last week as well, the increasingly red state of Ohio reelected Sen. Sherrod Brown (D).\n\nThis raises an important point, and is why we looked at state-level races, not presidential results. Elections come down to candidates and candidates can and do run out of lock-step with their parties. Republicans in Wyoming would think Gov. Charlie Baker (R-Mass.) is practically a liberal, but in Massachusetts he\u2019s further to the right than many voters. The Republican Party\u2019s post-Romney plan of action was specifically to run candidates who were more effective at appealing to groups outside of its base. In some places, they\u2019ve had luck with that strategy, distancing candidates from the harder-right portion of the party. (Baker and Hogan, for example, called for a delay in the highly partisan vote to confirm Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.)\n\nThat said, there\u2019s still a link between how states have voted in recent years and how diverse they are. There are about 10 states in each group below, with the most-heavily white states voting most heavily Republican, and vice versa.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nNotice that block in the 58 to 67 percent range. They break the pattern; one would expect them to vote Democratic by somewhere in the one to 10 percentage-point range. But this group includes states such as Alaska and Oklahoma, with large Native American or Native Alaskan populations, and the Southern states of Alabama, the Carolinas, Louisiana and Mississippi. They\u2019re counterbalanced by Delaware, Illinois and Virginia, but the overall shift is still to the right.\n\nIf we look not at current voting patterns but instead compare the change in diversity of a state with the change in its voting habits since the 1990 to 1994 period, the link is a bit more consistent. The states that saw the least decrease in the density of their white populations moved hard to the right. Those with the biggest drop in the density of white people moved more to the left.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nOne of the lessons of the era of Donald Trump is that some of that movement in the first two groups above may stem from that drop in the density of the white population. For those in charge of the Republican Party, though, those bottom two bars may still be sobering.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s Florida.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nPatterns aren\u2019t as neat as you might think.", "\n\nThings look sweet in Philadelphia following the trade for Jimmy Butler. Will that continue to be the case? (Matt Rourke/Associated Press)\n\nIn the end, most everyone got what they wanted from the Jimmy Butler drama.\n\nButler escaped Minnesota for the greener pastures of a team that could compete in the East. The Philadelphia 76ers snagged the two-way star they\u2019ve been desiring since an unsuccessful Kawhi Leonard pursuit. And the Timberwolves offloaded an extraordinarily disgruntled soon-to-be free agent, who was reportedly poisoning the well, for a surprisingly decent haul in return.\n\n[\u2018We want to win a championship\u2019: Jimmy Butler arrives in Philadelphia as trade becomes official]\n\nPerhaps the only one who didn\u2019t get what they wanted: Minnesota President/Coach Tom Thibodeau, once Butler\u2019s biggest champion and perhaps soon a victim of this whole saga.\n\nWith Butler set to make his 76ers debut on Wednesday night, we\u2019re turning to our panel of NBA experts for some true or false about what comes next.\n\nJimmy Butler will be bad for the 76ers\u2019 chemistry\n\nJerry Brewer, sports columnist: False. While Butler has had his issues with some teammates in Chicago and Minnesota, he will be on his best behavior initially in Philadelphia because he\u2019s playing for so much money in free agency next summer. He can\u2019t go to Philadelphia and ruin their young core after the damage he did in Minnesota and expect to be paid like a top-10 player. I also think the 76ers have a better locker room and a more responsible team than the Timberwolves had. Joel Embiid plays hard on both ends of the floor, which Butler will appreciate. Ben Simmons can create a ton of open looks for Butler. JJ Redick is a solid veteran that Butler can befriend and avoid feeling like he\u2019s running a day care in Philly.\n\nKevin Blackistone, sports columnist: True. If you\u2019re into analytics, the 76ers just broke up the best starting five in the league, based on net rating, to fit in Butler. They also shrank their strike zone by swapping out two guys in Robert Covington and Dario Saric who shoot lots of threes, which is all the NBA rage, for a guy who mostly doesn\u2019t. And if you\u2019re into history, Butler didn\u2019t get along with budding stars Andrew Wiggins and Karl-Anthony Towns. Now he\u2019s got to get along with Simmons, Embiid and Markelle Fultz. Poor Markelle.\n\nCandace Buckner, Wizards beat writer: Both true and false. While Jimmy may be harsh, maybe even a bully, on younger teammates, Embiid and Simmons don\u2019t seem like shrinking violets. They should be just fine when Jimmy goes full Jimmy \u2014 but second-year player Fultz, who spent his rookie season trying to build up his confidence and find his jumper, is who I\u2019d be worried about under Jimmy\u2019s iron-fisted leadership.\n\nJesse Dougherty, Nationals beat writer: False. Full disclosure: I was asked into this discussion because of my Philadelphia roots, and my fascination with (and support for) \u201cThe Process\u201d started by former general manager Sam Hinkie some six years ago. Good to be here. Long live creative roster-building. The easy prediction is that Butler will shake the chemistry that has become a hallmark of the 76ers' rise back to basketball relevance. Butler\u2019s forced exit from Minnesota paints him as a brash and selfish guard who can\u2019t jell in any locker room (even if that\u2019s unfair). Simmons has not yet shared a backcourt with another player who can handle the ball, so that should be interesting. And Embiid\u2019s outsize social media presence is bound to tick off a teammate at some point . . . right? I really don\u2019t think so. Winning can make even the most clashing personalities mesh, and I don\u2019t even see Butler, Simmons and Embiid as being all that different. And since they\u2019re going to win \u2014 at least against most teams, if not the NBA\u2019s elite quite yet \u2014 Philadelphia should not have to worry about this. But ask this question after their eventual playoff exit this spring and there is probably a totally different answer.\n\nThe Timberwolves will still be a bottom-10 team at the end of this season\n\nBrewer: True. Minnesota clearly has the talent to turn around this season, especially with Covington and Saric looking like ideal, role-playing fits on this roster. But the Timberwolves are shot. There\u2019s no trust on that team anymore. Thibodeau sold them out for Butler, and guys such as Towns and Wiggins won\u2019t forgive their coach easily. The Timberwolves won\u2019t be as bad as they\u2019ve been, but it\u2019s going to take a new season and more changes in order for them to heal and eliminate of some of the immaturity.\n\nBlackistone: True. They gave up a 20-point-plus per game scorer who was a lockdown perimeter defender for complimentary parts. That doesn\u2019t make them as good as, and certainly not better than, Utah, Sacramento or Houston, the West teams that are floundering so low. And Sacramento is a poor man\u2019s Sixers; the league will soon be hailing the Kings.\n\nBuckner: True. But if they wear more of those spiffy throwback \u201cClassic\u201d-edition jerseys, they\u2019ll be top-10 best dressed.\n\nDougherty: False. If for no other reason than that the Butler saga has now come and gone, this is a good trade for the Timberwolves. Covington and Saric gives them two versatile defenders and floor spacers (if Saric rediscovers his jumper), and that could play well on a roster with Towns and Wiggins. Covington, specifically, is a great wing defender and has the potential to be a premier knockdown shooter if he can iron the cold streaks out of his game. There is still a chance the Timberwolves will still be a bottom-10 team, but it won\u2019t be because of the pieces they added in Butler\u2019s place. And since 16 (!) teams make the NBA playoffs, doesn\u2019t bottom-10 still translate to \u201cpretty much in contention\u201d?\n\nA core of Butler, Embiid and Simmons can win a championship in the next five years\n\n\n\nOur panel isn't feeling Philly's title odds with this core. (Matt Rourke)\n\nBrewer: False. That\u2019s a strong top three players, for sure, and Philly has advanced from \u201cThe Process\u201d to the pursuit of championships. You\u2019re talking about three of the league\u2019s top 20 players on one team. Not many NBA teams have that kind of talent at the top of their roster. But this new Big Three needs help. Boston is still loaded with stars and role players. Toronto has plenty of depth around Kyle Lowry and Kawhi Leonard. Even Milwaukee feels like a more complete team. And those are just the prime contenders in the East. The Sixers need more \u2014 more development from Fultz, more shooters, more frontcourt depth \u2014 to play at a championship level.\n\nBlackistone: False. If Kawhi Leonard stays with the Raptors, their big three with Kyle Lowry and Serge Ibaka will be the East\u2019s most dominant the next few years. Then there\u2019s the Celtics' young roster which could mature to be better than all. It\u2019s not as easy as one, two, three.\n\nBuckner: False. The Sixers still lack depth and though Jimmy thinks Jimmy is a superstar, Jimmy\u2019s no LeBron. He\u2019s not going to carry a top-heavy team past a deeper Western Conference challenger.\n\nDougherty: True. It really depends on how the 76ers build from here, and how the offense actually looks once Butler is inserted this week, but Philadelphia should have a chance to win it all with this group. There are, of course, factors the 76ers can\u2019t control \u2014 what the Warriors look like for the next half decade, how the Celtics' roster shapes up once Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown are up for a second contract, where Kawhi Leonard ultimately lands, and so on \u2014 yet they are now only a few moves away from having a championship-caliber team to pit against the league\u2019s already-built title contenders. Losing Covington and Saric made them really thin on the wings, and if Fultz never finds his shot, the 76ers are going to need another guard who can create his own scoring chances with the second unit. They also could use a floor-spacing forward who can guard multiple positions. So they essentially need a Covington. Good luck finding one at the same discounted price.\n\nTom Thibodeau\u2019s days in Minnesota are numbered\n\nBrewer: True. Thibs didn\u2019t just fail his team in this Butler fiasco. He failed his owner, Glen Taylor. And let\u2019s not even get into the numbers that Zach LaVine is putting up for Chicago. On so many levels, the Timberwolves got this wrong, and it\u2019s hard to see the team moving forward with Thibodeau leading them. It is probably a matter of when he\u2019s getting fired, not if.\n\nBlackistone: Half true, or half false. Timberwolves President Thibodeau should be fired for only getting a wing and a biscuit for Butler. Timberwolves Coach Thibodeau should flourish with the albatross of a bad attitude removed and the addition of two guys who can space the floor for Towns to dominate the paint.\n\nBuckner: False. Maybe as president of basketball operations, but not as a head coach. While Thibodeau can still be an effective coach, if he\u2019s given time, his role in revamping the Timberwolves into the 2014 Chicago Bulls should come to an end. Besides the coach/president trend seems to be a thing of the past.\n\nDougherty: False. Going to take this question very literally and say it\u2019s a stretch that Thibodeau\u2019s days are numbers. There is a chance his months are numbered, since Minnesota is talented enough (and now much deeper with Covington and Saric) that shortcomings should probably fall on the coach. But the whole Butler situation, and now a reshaped roster, has likely bought Thibodeau an extended chance to turn this thing around.\n\nAre you interested in smart, thoughtful analysis of the NBA from The Washington Post and around the Web delivered to your inbox every Monday morning?

(Chandan Khanna/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nMohammed Sheikh Anwar is a Rohingya activist and journalist.\n\nBy now, the world is well aware of the horrors experienced by Myanmar\u2019s Rohingya minority over the past two years. Starting on Aug. 25, 2017, the Myanmar military unleashed a campaign of terror against the Rohingya in the country\u2019s western Rakhine state, compelling virtually the entire community to flee. Since then, more than 700,000 Rohingya have sought refuge in neighboring Bangladesh.\n\nThis week, according to an agreement between Bangladesh and Myanmar, the refugees are supposed to start going back. The problem: No one has ever asked us, the Rohingya, what we want. Once again our fate is being determined over our heads \u2014 without the slightest reference to our own desires. This must stop.\n\nIn reality, the so-called repatriation plan is nothing but a scheme designed to whitewash the Myanmar military\u2019s crimes and to help it escape accountability. Under pressure from the international community, the Myanmar government is trying to show its eagerness to take refugees back from Bangladesh \u2014 but without fulfilling our demands for equal rights and security.\n\nMyanmar is highly unlikely to return the refugees to their homes. Most Rohingya villages were burned down by the Myanmar military during its campaign of genocidal violence. For that reason, those who return are apparently to be resettled in internment camps. Some observers worry this is tied to Chinese-backed economic projects that have been planned on the emptied Rohingya lands in the region.\n\nUnsurprisingly, virtually no Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh or anywhere else are willing to go back to Myanmar and live in these concentration camps. The Myanmar government has tricked some into believing that life in the camps will be temporary, until they can be allowed to return to their villages once they are rebuilt. The government spreads this false hope through collaborators (who are sometimes Rohingya themselves) as well as through some international agencies who act as brokers for the Myanmar government and aid agencies seeking to gain contracts in Rakhine state. Both the Rohingya and the international community have succumbed to such trickery many times before. The problem is compounded by the lack of independent media access to the areas concerned. If the refugees are sent back, the crisis will fade away from the international spotlight. And this will allow the familiar cycle of violence and injustice to begin again.\n\nThe Rohingya should only return to Myanmar once our conditions have been fulfilled. Our demands are straightforward. The government must restore our citizenship and our status as an indigenous group \u2014 a status that will ensure us equal rights. Returnees from Bangladesh, as well as those who have been internally displaced in Rakhine state since June 2012, should be resettled only in their original villages. The resettled areas should be provided with international protection to ensure that the perpetrators, including the Myanmar military, are never again able to commit such crimes against us. There are, after all, no guarantees that Bangladesh will open its borders to save Rohingya lives next time around.\n\nIn the meantime, the international community must end the culture of impunity by bringing the perpetrators \u2014 namely the Myanmar military and responsible government officials \u2014 to justice. It should follow the recommendations of the U.N. Human Rights Council\u2019s fact-finding mission on Myanmar and criminally investigate and charge them with crimes against humanity and genocide.\n\nMy family knows of what I speak. On Sept. 12, 2017, the Myanmar military and Rakhine extremists attacked my village in southern Maungdaw Township and burned the whole village down, forcing my elderly parents and others in the family to flee to Bangladesh.\n\nSadly, there is nothing new about these atrocities. On Dec. 26, 1951, the London Times reported that approximately 250,000 Arakanese Muslims (Rohingya) fled from Burma (as Myanmar was then known) into neighboring East Bengal (now Bangladesh) to escape violence. Since the late 1970s, successive regimes have pursued a policy of slow-burning genocide against the Rohingya. Violence against us has been perpetrated under different pretexts for the past four decades \u2014 each time resulting in large-scale refugee flows into Bangladesh.\n\nOn Sept. 1, 2017, Sr. Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, the Myanmar army\u2019s commander in chief, described the clearing of the Rohingya as \u201cunfinished business\u201d from World War II, referring to a period during the war when ethnic Rakhine and Burmese Buddhists who sided with the advancing Japanese forces clashed with the Muslim Rohingya, who supported the retreating British. The general\u2019s statement shows the deep roots of the Myanmar government\u2019s policies of extermination of the Rohingya.\n\nIt is crucial that the Rohingya people receive international protection to prevent a repetition of the cycle of violence. As the history of the past 40 years has taught us, official promises in Myanmar provide no guarantees of security or survival, let alone equal rights.", "The U.S. envoy for hostage affairs Tuesday called on Iran and Russia to use their influence in Syria to help free Austin Tice, an American freelance journalist who was taken captive there six years ago.\n\nRobert C.

And they\u2019re heavily involved in Syria.\u201d\n\nLater, he added, \u201cIf Iran wants better relations with the United States, it should use its influence in Syria to help us return Austin home.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Brien sounded a similar note when asked about Russia, which provides military support to the Syrian government.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that both Russia and the United States should agree on is that innocent Americans, or innocent Russians, for that matter, should not be held hostage and should not be held against their will,\u201d he said. \u201cWe continue to call on the Russians to exert whatever influence they can in Syria to bring Austin home.\u201d\n\nThe status of U.S. efforts to free citizens imprisoned overseas as geopolitical pawns is a closely held secret. O\u2019Brien, who was appointed to the job in July, made rare public remarks during an event at the National Press Club focused on raising reward money for information on Tice, who is now 37.\n\nThe former Marine and Georgetown University law student was in Syria reporting on the beginnings of the civil war when he was taken prisoner in August 2012. His stories focusing on the war\u2019s impact on civilians appeared in The Washington Post and McClatchy Newspapers.\n\nAbout five weeks after Tice vanished, a proof-of-life video turned up in which Tice said repeatedly, \u201cOh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus,\u201d as armed men led him blindfolded down a rocky mountainside. There was no message apart from the headline: \u201cAustin Tice is alive.\u201d He has not been heard from since.\n\nDespite the passage of years, U.S. officials and Tice\u2019s parents, Marc Tice and Debra Tice, are convinced he is still alive.\n\n\u201cAustin is a strong, fit young man,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. We have every reason to believe that he is alive. We believe that he\u2019s being held captive in Syria.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Brien said that Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, has asked her fellow ambassadors for help freeing Tice. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and John Bolton, U.S. national security adviser, have both met with Tice\u2019s parents.\n\nIn April, the FBI offered a $1 million reward for information leading to Tice\u2019s return. The National Press Club and Reporters Without Borders are spearheading a campaign to double the reward through a project called Night Out for Austin Tice. Restaurants in the Washington area are being encouraged to donate a share of their proceeds May 2, the evening before World Press Freedom Day. The organizers plan eventually to take the campaign nationwide.\n\nTice\u2019s parents have made several trips to the Middle East hoping to bring their son home. Marc Tice said they are about to leave on their seventh or eighth trip to Beirut \u2014 at this point, they are unsure how many trips they\u2019ve made to advocate for their son. The trips are intended to reach out to those who are holding their son captive.\n\n\u201cEvery time we go, our greatest desire to is to bring Austin home,\u201d his father said. \u201cWe know Austin longs to walk free. Two thousand, two hundred and eighty-two days. Austin urgently needs to be free. Maybe soon.\u201d", "On Monday, on the same evening the Associated Press called the Arizona Senate race for Democrat Kyrsten Sinema in a distant conceptual universe, a golden retriever sits on the couch beside his owner and listens to her voice.\n\nThe woman sounds a bit subdued, even disappointed. But she isn\u2019t scolding anyone. Her cadence is warm, calm and firm and \u2014 importantly \u2014 she is stroking Boomer\u2019s paw, which probably means everything is going to be okay.\n\n\u201cHey, everybody, I just called Kyrsten Sinema and congratulated her on becoming Arizona\u2019s first female senator after a hard-fought battle,\u201d she says. \u201cI wish her all success as she represents Arizona in the Senate.\u201d\n\nThe woman is not looking at Boomer as she speaks but rather at a camera on the other side of the living room. Boomer looks at it, too. The woman has been talking to cameras a lot lately.\n\nHe first met her four years earlier, when he was still pretty much a puppy. Boomer\u2019s first owners had given him up, so the woman took him to live with her in Tucson, in a house with a yard filled with tennis balls.\n\nShe had a different notion of dog behavior than he was used to and didn\u2019t exactly look pleased when she\u2019d find him lying on the dining room table. But she forgave him when he buried her mother\u2019s pajamas under the mesquite tree, and in time she\u2019d tell people that she couldn\u2019t imagine life without him.\n\nA few months after Boomer\u2019s first birthday, in 2014, the woman got a new job and started leaving town a lot. But that was okay; the next-door neighbor would watch Boomer while his owner was at the U.S. Capitol in Washington.\n\n[McSally win gives GOP historic majority in House]\n\n\u201cAnd I also want to say thank you to everybody who supported me in this campaign,\u201d she says, still looking at the camera, and Boomer starts to fidget on the couch. \u201cMy staff and volunteers and everybody who voted for me.\u201d\n\nOne day, when Boomer was a little over 3 years old, cameras followed the pair as she walked him through the Arizona desert.

She doesn\u2019t look back and continues her short speech:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so grateful to you as my wingmen and my wingwomen in this journey. We sure wish it came out with a different result, but I\u2019m so thankful for you.\u201d\n\nShe started traveling a lot this year. Even when she wasn\u2019t working in Washington, she\u2019d go to towns and cities across Arizona, with crowds and cameras and signs reading, \u201cMartha McSally for U.S. Senate.\u201d\n\nShe took him with her to a rally in Sun City two weeks ago. \u201cCome here, boo boo!\u201d she called, and tried to grab him as he ran across the stage and the crowd laughed.\n\n\u201cMay I introduce to you Don Jr. \u2014 Don Trump Jr.\u201d she told the crowd a minute later. Then a man in a suit came on stage and started to talk about \u201cfake news\u201d and \u201cradical socialist policies.\u201d Before long, the crowd was yelling, and Boomer didn\u2019t return to the stage that day.\n\nLast Tuesday, the woman stayed up very late and sounded happy when she went to bed.\n\nA great night for Arizona\u2014 heading to bed with a lead of over 14,000 votes.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), that the office has completed an investigation related to her stewardship of Burlington College and decided not to bring charges, a top adviser to the senator said Tuesday.\n\nThe investigation centered on a 2010 land purchase that relocated the college Jane Sanders previously ran to a new campus on more than 32 acres along Lake Champlain. While lining up a $6.7 million loan and additional financing, she told college trustees and lenders that the college had commitments for millions of dollars in donations that could be used to repay the loan, according to former trustees and state officials.\n\n[Federal prosecutors step up probe of land deal pushed by wife of Bernie Sanders]\n\nTrustees said they later discovered that many of the donors had not agreed to the amounts or the timing of the donations listed on documents Sanders provided to a state bonding agency and a bank. That led to her resignation in 2011 amid complaints from some trustees that she had provided inaccurate information, former college officials said.\n\nThe land deal, the officials said, became a financial albatross for the 160-student school, contributing to its closure in 2016.\n\nJeff Weaver, who served as campaign manager for Bernie Sanders during his 2016 presidential campaign and remains an adviser, said Jane Sanders had been told \u201cin recent days\u201d that the land deal is no longer under investigation.\n\n\u201cJane Sanders has been informed that the U.S. Attorney in Vermont has closed its investigation of the Burlington College land deal and has decided not to bring charges of any kind,\u201d Weaver said in a statement. \u201cJane is grateful that the investigation has come to an end. As she has said from the beginning she has done nothing wrong, and Jane is pleased that the matter has now come to a conclusion.\u201d\n\nKraig LaPorte, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Vermont, would not confirm or deny the existence of an investigation, in keeping with office policy.\n\n[\u2018Run, Bernie, Run!\u2019: Sanders\u2019s 2016 campaign manager urges another bid in new memoir]\n\nWhile both Bernie Sanders and Jane Sanders had insisted from the outset that she did nothing wrong, the case loomed as a potential liability if the senator makes another run for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020.\n\nThe senator, who easily won reelection last week, has not signaled whether he will run for president. In a book published this year, Weaver argued that Sanders would be the most likely candidate to topple President Trump.\n\nShawn Boburg and Jack Gillum contributed to this report.", "Three years ago, when he was a candidate for president, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) lamented that his party was \u201cin a hole with Hispanics\u201d and said then-candidate Donald Trump should not be the party\u2019s spokesman on the issue of immigration.\n\nNow, in the wake of Republican losses in House races in last week\u2019s midterms, Graham has found another problem plaguing his party. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to address the suburban-woman problem, because it\u2019s real,\u201d he said on Fox News as Democrats were claiming the majority in the House.\n\nGraham conceded that \u201cstyle does matter, and sometimes it can drown out substance.\u201d He said he thought President Trump was moving to address the issue of his tone. But there\u2019s little evidence to back that up. Trump is the principal reason for the GOP\u2019s woeful performance in competitive suburban House districts.\n\nFor many suburban women \u2014 not all, by any means, but for many \u2014 Trump is toxic. It is not just that they disagree with him. Disagreement on some policy issues did not create the energy that brought so many women off the sidelines and into political activism. It was the president\u2019s style, his behavior, his treatment of other people, the allegations of sexual misconduct, the disrespect he has shown.\n\nThese attitudes were on display in the days after the midterms, when Trump berated three female African American White House correspondents, all professionals and all doing their jobs. What he said to them \u2014 calling out one for asking what he said was a stupid question, when it was not, and claiming another had asked a racist question, which it was not \u2014 was more than disrespectful. It was beneath the office he holds.\n\nWomen see those moments and form lasting opinions about the president. Women who have fought discrimination and endured sexual harassment in the workplace or elsewhere recoil when the president makes comments like that. Judgments began solidifying early in his campaign when he labeled illegal immigrants from Mexico as rapists and worse, when he attacked a federal judge of Mexican heritage, when he went after a Gold Star family whose Muslim son had been killed in combat, when the Access Hollywood video went public.\n\n\n\nA women\u2019s group attends a weekly gathering to write postcards in Philadelphia on Aug. 3, 2018, as a way to hold President Trump to account. (Jessica Kourkounis/For The Washington Post)\n\nThat was enough to bring women into the streets the day after Trump\u2019s inauguration, and it hasn\u2019t stopped. Women talked to one another about the despair they felt when he won, about the feelings of depression that lasted weeks or months. Women formed the backbone of local resistance groups that sprang up after his election two years ago. They found strength in one another as they became active in campaigns around the country.\n\n[Suburban women talk about what 2018 election means to them]\n\nTwo races in the Denver suburbs, where I spent time talking with female voters during the late summer and fall as part of a project with my colleague Mary Jordan, highlight what happened when women became active.\n\nIn the 6th Congressional District, which wraps around the east and south sides of Denver, Rep. Mike Coffman (R-Colo.) had survived multiple attempts by Democrats to defeat him. The district is highly diverse, from classic suburban housing developments to areas populated by immigrants from all over the world. More than 100 languages are spoken in the schools in Aurora, in Arapahoe County. Coffman was constantly attentive to those communities. He also sought to keep the president at arm\u2019s length when he felt it was necessary, rhetorically at least if not in his voting patterns.\n\nCoffman won narrowly in 2012 after the district had been redrawn to become more Democratic. In 2014, he won by nine percentage points, and in 2016 he carried the district by eight points. President Barack Obama in 2012 and Hillary Clinton in 2016 were winners in the 6th District.\n\nLast week, Coffman was buried in his reelection bid, losing to Democrat Jason Crow by 11 points, 54 percent to 43 percent. His loss came in part because of the tireless work of many women who made phone calls, knocked on doors and volunteered in other ways.\n\nIn the suburbs on the other side of Denver, a race for the state Senate brought similar results. This race pitted two women against one another \u2014 Democrat Jessie Danielson, a member of the Colorado state House, and Republican Christine Jensen, a business executive running for the legislature for the first time.\n\nThis race was seen earlier in the year as probably one of the most competitive in the state \u2014 and one that could determine whether Democrats gained control of the Senate. Outside money poured into the district, and locally both women were aided by volunteers. The outcome in Senate District 20 wasn\u2019t even close. Danielson carried the district by 12 points \u2014 54 percent to 42 percent.\n\nDemocrats ended up in control of the state Senate, along with the state House and the governorship, with Gov.-elect Jared Polis defeating Republican Walker Stapleton by 10 points. Colorado has been described as a classic purple state, but it is going to trend blue unless Republicans find a way to regain strength in the suburbs, particularly with female voters, as well as among Hispanic voters.\n\n[Record number of women headed toward the House after midterm vote]\n\nFor some women in suburban areas, Trump\u2019s policy priorities override their feelings about his personal behavior. I have exchanged emails and talked with a woman who lives in the Richmond area, is college-educated and employed at an urban school. She asked to be identified only as \u201cM. Davis.\u201d\n\n\u201cDonald Trump is like no other individual in office today,\u201d she said when she first wrote last summer. \u201cI would never promote his marriages, lifestyle, tweets, comments, language as something to be emulated. He is a coarse man on many levels. His policies and appointments that decrease red tape, encourage employment, lower taxes, promote jobs, enable freedom of religion and speech are what I expected when I voted for him in 2016, and I am looking forward to reelecting him. I am under no illusions about his personal character.\u201d\n\nThis is to say that female voters are hardly monolithic and that there are many college-educated women in suburban areas who back the president with intense loyalty. But the results of last week were a stark reminder that there are many more women in the suburbs who feel the same way as Jessica Rogers, who helped organize the first Women\u2019s March in Denver.\n\nRogers has never liked Trump. When he was the star of \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d she found him \u201cabusive.\u201d When he won the election, she was in denial. Before Trump\u2019s election, she was not particularly active politically. That changed with the election, as her reaction to what happened brought her to action, although career issues sometimes kept her from doing as much as she wanted to do.\n\nAsked a few months ago to describe how she felt about Trump as his presidency unfolded, she replied, \u201cGut-aching rage and anxiety.\u201d\n\nFor Rogers, the confirmation of Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court also motivated her in the final weeks of the campaign. She said the retirement of Justice Anthony M. Kennedy last summer was as wrenching as the election of Trump, if not more so. Republicans such as Graham said that the Democrats\u2019 handling of the hearings energized their voters and probably contributed to the defeat of three Democratic senators in red states. But for Rogers and many women, the opposite occurred. It probably contributed to GOP losses in suburban House districts.\n\nOther issues helped the Democrats take control of the House. Health care and protection of coverage for people with preexisting conditions played a role, for example. But more than anything, it was the president who sparked the revolt among suburban women \u2014 and the candidacies of female candidates \u2014 that played out in district after district.\n\nThose in the Republican Party, such as Graham, who worry about their deficit among suburban women cannot deny the role their president has played in creating the conditions that led to last week\u2019s results. Whether they will act on that is another question. So far it doesn\u2019t look like they are prepared to do so.", "Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) arrives for orientation for new members of Congress on Nov. 13 in Washington.

The Washington region is likely to deal with a messy conglomeration of precipitation, possibly starting as snow and sleet, before changing to rain.\n\nBecause frozen precipitation is expected to arrive around dawn or a little before, it could lead to slick conditions and cause delays and cancellations, especially in colder locations north and west of the Beltway.\n\n[D.C. winter outlook 2018-2019: We predict snowier than normal conditions for the first time in three years]\n\nA changeover from frozen precipitation to rain is expected as Thursday wears on, happening first in our warmer locations to the east and last in our colder locations to the west. Accumulation of snow and sleet is possible, with the greatest amounts in our colder locations.\n\nTreated roads and sidewalks should be manageable, but untreated pavement could accumulate a slippery coating, especially north and west of the Beltway where ground temperatures will be a little colder.\n\nWhen the precipitation moves in, it is likely to quickly become moderate to heavy at times, which increases the potential for areas of travel disruption. Most of the precipitation should fall between about 7 a.m. and 5 p.m. with the equivalent of an inch of rain or so falling in this period (from both rain and melted snow and sleet).\n\nAnother round of rain showers, possibly mixed with snow and sleet in our colder locations, could move through Thursday night as a trailing disturbance swings by.\n\nThe total amount of snow and sleet accumulation is a big wild card at this point and will depend on how fast the cold air over the region erodes. Some models predict that precipitation will change from snow and sleet to rain quickly (meaning little or no accumulation around D.C.), while others will take longer.\n\nOur initial thought is that we could see an inch or so of snow/sleet inside the Beltway and to the south and east, with one to three inches possible north and west, before slightly higher temperatures and more rain mixing in limit additional accumulation and reduce road impacts during the afternoon into evening. However, these amounts could be lower or higher, depending on the timing of the changeover to rain.\n\n\n\nSnow amount forecasts from several models for the Washington region. (PivotalWeather.com)\n\nSouthern Maryland is expected to get mostly rain from this event.\n\nThe timing of the precipitation is an important variable in this storm. The earlier the precipitation moves into the area, the greater the probability of meaningful frozen precipitation because temperatures will be lower. Later timing would give the atmosphere more time to warm up.\n\nIf Washington manages at least an inch of snow, it will be the first instance in November since 1989 when 3.5 inches fell. We think there\u2019s about a 30 to 40 percent chance of this happening.\n\n[It could snow in Washington on Thursday. How often does that happen in November?]\n\nA more significant winter storm is possible toward north-central and northwest Maryland (near and west of Hagerstown), where at least three inches of snow is possible before a wintry mix, and toward the Shenandoah Valley and west-central Virginia, where a significant freezing rain/ice storm is quite possible. In this zone, a winter storm watch has been issued.\n\nA Winter Storm Watch is in effect late Wed night thru late Thu night for portions of western MD, eastern Panhandle of WV, Shenandoah Valley, and the Blue Ridge mountains. Heavy mixed wintry precipitation will be possible.

This is a phenomenon known as cold air damming and is expected to keep our daytime temperatures in the 30s and even near to below freezing in the usual colder locations well west and north of the city. At the same time, an area of low pressure is expected to organize along the Southeast coast and track northward along or near the coast spreading precipitation into the area.\n\nAll the models are advertising that some winter weather will affect the region starting around rush hour Thursday. However, they differ on how much of an effect the storm could have as they differ on how quickly the precipitation transitions from frozen to rain around the city and our western suburbs. During these damming events, the wise path is usually to lean toward the models with the highest vertical resolution and the coldest low-level temperatures as the cold air can be tenacious.\n\nBelow we present two scenarios for the Washington region: a cold scenario, in which we see more frozen precipitation; and a somewhat less possible, milder scenario in which snow and sleet change to rain more quickly.\n\nScenario 1: Colder, snow/sleet scenario (60 percent chance)\n\nThe cold scenario begins with the precipitation arriving around just before dawn in the District. The precipitation could start as a brief period of rain and sleet before changing to sleet and eventually a period of snow.\n\nAcross the District, the snow might last only an hour or so but could produce accumulations of about an inch. Up to a few inches could quickly come down in our colder areas north and west of the city where snow may last a bit longer.\n\nIn the city and the close-in suburbs, temperatures are forecast to remain above freezing so accumulations probably would be limited to grassy surfaces and trees, but if the snow falls heavily, sloppy minor accumulations might be possible on untreated roads.\n\n\n\nHigh resolution NAM model simulated radar between 4 a.m. and 5 p.m. Thursday. (PivotalWeather.com)\n\nAfter this possible burst of snow, precipitation would change back to sleet and then rain as temperatures rise above freezing, before tapering off in the midafternoon. The exception to this might be in areas from Leesburg to Frederick and to the north and west, where temperatures may remain near freezing for the duration of the event, and snow would change to a mix of sleet and freezing rain before tapering off.\n\nThe high-resolution NAM and latest run of the European model present this colder, snowier scenario. (A caution is needed about the European model forecast snow maps that may be floating around.

(Hatem Moussa/Associated Press)\n\nJERUSALEM \u2014 The latest round of fighting in Gaza is rooted in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and comes after Israel and the territory\u2019s Hamas rulers have fought three wars in the past decade.\n\nThe fighting in recent years has killed thousands of Palestinians and scores of Israelis, but has yet to dislodge the Islamic militant group or resolve any of the other underlying disputes between the two sides.\n\nHere is a look at some key events in the Israel-Hamas conflict:\n\nSeptember 2005\n\nIsrael withdraws all settlements and military personnel from the Gaza Strip, marking the end of its 38-year occupation of the territory.\n\n___\n\nJanuary 2006\n\nThe Palestinian Islamic militant group Hamas wins an overwhelming victory in parliamentary elections, sparking a struggle for primacy with its rival, the Fatah movement of Western-backed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.\n\n___\n\nJune 2006\n\nHamas militants capture Israeli soldier Gilad Schalit in a cross-border raid, triggering heavy fighting with Israel. Schalit is released five years later following a lopsided prisoner exchange.\n\n___\n\nJune 2007\n\nHamas violently ousts Fatah forces from the Gaza Strip and solidifies its control of the territory. Israel and Egypt tighten their blockade of Gaza, which will devastate Gaza\u2019s economy over the next decade. Two rival governments emerge, Hamas in Gaza and the Abbas\u2019 Palestinian Authority in the West Bank.\n\n___\n\nDecember 2008\n\nIn response to heavy rocket fire from Gaza, Israel launches a major three-week offensive. After a 22-day war that kills 1,200 Palestinians and 13 Israelis, the two sides announce a cease-fire.\n\n___\n\nNovember 2012\n\nIsrael targets and kills Hamas military chief Ahmad Jabari, sparking eight days of militant rocket fire and an Israeli air campaign. Egyptian mediators secure a cease-fire after some 150 Palestinians and six Israelis are killed.\n\n___\n\nJuly-August 2014\n\nFollowing the kidnapping and killing of three Israeli teenagers by Hamas members, Israel conducts a sweep against Hamas in the West Bank, prompting rocket attacks from Gaza and Israeli air raids in response. The seven-week conflict that ensues results in more than 2,200 Palestinian deaths in Gaza, more than half of them civilians. In Israel, 67 soldiers and 6 civilians are killed. Israel comes under heavy international criticism for its use of what the United Nations calls disproportionate force.\n\n___\n\nMarch 2018\n\nPalestinian protesters, led by Hamas, stage massive demonstrations along the perimeter fence against the blockade. Although mostly unarmed, many protesters burn tires, throw rocks and grenades at Israeli troops and damage the perimeter fence. Israeli troops kill more than 170 protesters over a period of several months. Israel says it is defending its border but is accused of using excessive force. Israel and Hamas engage in a number of rounds of intense but brief fighting during this time.\n\n___\n\nNovember 2018:\n\nViolence flares up after a botched Israeli undercover raid into Gaza that killed seven Palestinian militants and a senior Israeli army officer, marking the most serious escalation since the war in 2014. Gaza militants fire hundreds of rockets at Israel in response, killing a Palestinian laborer in southern Israel.

The massive expansion comes with investments of more than $5 billion, 50,000 jobs, and an influx of highly paid workers and their families into the chosen communities. But winning the grand prize also comes with hefty baggage.\n\nBelow are some winners and losers.\n\nWinners\n\nAmazon\n\nThe Amazon sweepstakes generated more than a year of free publicity for the company. City officials pleaded with the company as they bid to make their cities seem more attractive than their competitors'. Some offered gifts, posted videos of themselves unboxing Amazon Prime packages and even teased that they would change their names. They also proposed a plethora of tax incentives and subsidies to a company run by the richest man in the world. (Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.) Maryland\u2019s offer, which was among the few that was made public, amounted to $8.5 billion in tax credits and incentives.\n\nOn top of being offered such perks, Amazon now has a unique and valuable set of data: an intimate look inside infrastructure plans and labor markets of dozens of cities. As the company continues to grow, it can use this information to try to grab more concessions from state and local governments and gain an edge over its own competitors, analysts say.\n\nWith new home bases in the Washington area and New York, Amazon will soon have a huge presence in two talent-rich cities, giving the company a larger pool of workers from which to draw and attractive locations to offer prospective employees.\n\nBut the company\u2019s public competition has drawn scrutiny. Critics such as urban studies author and academic Richard Florida have called Amazon\u2019s search for a second headquarters a \u201csham\u201d that duped cities into giving up huge taxpayer-funded benefits. Others have criticized the company\u2019s decision to split its new headquarters, changing the rules in the middle of the selection process.\n\nProperty owners and developers\n\nLandlords and residents looking to sell their homes are seeing green in Amazon\u2019s arrival. The company says that many of its jobs will offer salaries above $100,000, with thousands of highly paid managers and computer engineers looking for a place to settle their families. The surge in housing demand is expected to lead to higher prices. And with an influx of workers who have more money to spend on housing, developers will have greater incentive to build and sell bigger homes and luxury apartment buildings.\n\n[Property owners are delighted Amazon will be moving in. Renters, first-time buyers? Not so much.]\n\nAmazon, based in Seattle, estimates that from 2010 to 2016, $38 billion of indirect investments have flowed to the local economy. That could be a sign of things to come for development in the two new locations.\n\nHighly skilled workers\n\nExecutives, managers, engineers, lawyers, accountants and administrative professionals based on the East Coast or hoping to move there have yet another major company eager for their talents. The best tech-industry workers near the two new Amazon locations will also see their salaries swell. Employers will have to shell out more cash to retain their top-performing staff members or risk losing them to Amazon. Also, the company\u2019s grand arrival will probably force other big-name companies to expand their footprints in those metropolitan areas to stay competitive in hiring and recruitment, analysts say, offering tech workers even more opportunities.\n\nLosers\n\nRenters and low-income residents\n\nAs the fortunes of homeowners may rise, first-time home buyers, renters and low-income residents could stand to lose. Amazon\u2019s expansion is expected to trigger escalating housing costs, analysts say, potentially pricing out residents who don\u2019t bring in big paychecks. Rather than erect an apartment building with 50 units, a developer might build 25 larger units with opulent furnishings to cater to the bigger budgets of high-earners. The New York and D.C. metro areas already suffer from housing-affordability issues, which may worsen with the arrival of a steady stream of workers and if home prices take off.\n\nCritics point to Seattle as a harbinger of a worsening housing market and a crisis of homelessness. Residents with lower incomes may see more financial pressure just to maintain their quality of life, experts say.\n\nAn analysis by rental-search site HotPads, however, found that rents in the D.C. area would increase by only 0.6 percent with Amazon\u2019s move, Washington Post writers Tracy Jan and Kathy Orton reported.\n\nCertain local business owners\n\nRestaurants, cafes and bars may get more foot traffic from the new workers and residents. But business owners who lease their spaces will also probably face a price hike as demand for real estate in the area increases, experts say. Business tenants who lease office space and don\u2019t offer services or dining will also be hard-pressed to find a benefit from having Amazon settle in. Local shops may see rising costs as their rents increase and, like retailers across the country, will continue to face stiff competition from online-shopping powerhouses like Amazon.\n\nCommuters\n\nTraffic can always get worse. And it usually does.\n\nThe D.C. region\u2019s traffic congestion is among the worst in the country. Along the Interstate 395 corridor, where Amazon would be located, traffic is especially extreme. On Friday, for instance, travelers described total gridlock and chaos as they tried to make their way to Reagan National Airport when Metro service was suspended. Some passengers, desperate to catch their flights, ran to the airport from Crystal City, the neighborhood Amazon will soon call home. (Amazon\u2019s Crystal City HQ is within a half-mile \u2014 or a panicked walking distance!)\n\nNew York traffic is inescapable, too. As a sign of how bad things are, and how much worse they are getting, the city has the nation\u2019s most extensive congestion-alert system warning drivers to stay off the roads. The number of alert days will rise to 16 this year, up from 10 last year, according to the New York Times, owing in part to construction, a rise in delivery and ride-hailing vehicles, and security-related street closures. A campaign to set up a congestion-pricing plan that would charge drivers in Manhattan for using the most clogged lanes failed to pass this year.\n\nTransit systems in New York and Washington can be nightmarish in their own ways. The D.C. Metrorail system has faced a raft of safety and reliability problems over several years, which has led to falling ridership. But service delays continue to prompt overcrowding. And in New York, a year after the governor declared that the subway is in a state of emergency, service remains dismal.\n\nRival tech companies\n\nHolding on to the best employees just got harder for Amazon\u2019s competitors in New York, Washington and everywhere else.\n\nBusinesses that depend on skilled engineers, product managers, and legal and accounting staff will expect to see their labor costs go up, as they try to stop Amazon from poaching their best. To keep staff from jumping ship, tech companies will be compelled to pay their people higher salaries and boost their perks.\n\nTech companies without a large Washington or New York presence will also lose an edge in recruiting computer science graduates. Aside from being a world-class technology company, Amazon will now boast a headquarters in two thriving East Coast cities, a huge draw for the next generation of educated young people who don\u2019t see themselves moving to Seattle or Silicon Valley.\n\nU.S. cities\n\nAmazon\u2019s selection of the D.C. and New York regions is the latest example of prosperous, talent-rich, highly educated coastal cities winning corporate deals to the detriment of mid-tier and smaller cities. More than 200 locations submitted proposals to Amazon and have now lost out on tens of thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in investments.\n\nIn addition, these losing cities may be in a weaker position to secure future corporate headquarters because Washington and New York have gained even more job opportunities, skilled workers and private-sector dollars. Superstar cities with universities, a skilled workforce and cultural cache keep winning business deals, experts say, reinforcing their economic advantages. This dynamic may create a kind of momentum that\u2019s difficult for less affluent cities to overcome.\n\nIf investments by large employers continue to flow unevenly across the country, the lopsided pull of wealthy, densely developed, high-paying cities could exacerbate income inequality and entrench an economic system dominated by a handful of prosperous tech hubs, analysts say.\n\nIt depends\n\nLocal government\n\nTelling voters that you brought home the big one may seem like a flashy political win for the mayor. But not all constituents may see it that way. To win over Amazon, city officials had to offer attractive incentives, which may have included massive tax breaks and promises to build out public infrastructure. What elected officials might view as a huge jobs victory, taxpayers might see as a fleecing. The benefits that Amazon has promised to the areas might also flow to a narrow subset of people who are already living the dream while the costs will burden everyone. While the immediate upside of landing a prestigious development deal may seem clear, what remains harder to foretell is the long-term consequences of a tech giant becoming a neighbor.", "\n\nBrooklyn's Caris LeVert is attended to after a severe injury during a game against the Timberwolves. (Hannah Foslien/AP)\n\nThe Brooklyn Nets' Caris LeVert suffered a horrifying leg injury and was stretchered off the court during a road game Monday against the Minnesota Timberwolves, but the news from the Nets on Tuesday was encouraging: LeVert dislocated his right foot and did not suffer any fractures or severe ligament damage.

LeVert was going for a chase-down block as time was running out in the second quarter when he landed awkwardly on his right leg with his foot pointing at an unnatural angle. (The video can be seen here, but warning, it\u2019s graphic.)\n\nLeVert had his head under a towel and appeared to be sobbing as he was taken off the court on a stretcher, and teammate Rondae Hollis-Jefferson shed a few tears during the ensuing free throw attempts by the Timberwolves' Josh Okogie.

(AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee)\n\nSeveral pro-Trump Facebook pages and one Twitter account on Monday posted the home address and phone number of the Broward County, Fla., election supervisor who has been the target of blistering criticism from the president and other Republicans amid highly politicized vote recounts.\n\nPosting the home address of Elections Supervisor Brenda Snipes \u2014 a tactic called \u201cdoxing\u201d \u2014 often is a step toward harassment of people in the public spotlight and is prohibited by Facebook, Twitter and most other online platforms. The incident came amid rising vilification of the top election official in Florida\u2019s most Democratic county as the state recounts closely fought elections for the governorship and U.S. Senate.\n\nFacebook confirmed Tuesday that it had removed personal information about Snipes after the incident was reported to the company. It also confirmed a similar incident involving Palm Beach County\u2019s Elections Supervisor Susan Bucher, whose home address and phone number also were posted on a Facebook page.\n\nTwitter declined to comment. Two tweets from an account visible Tuesday morning were deleted by noon.\n\nThe posting of the home addresses and phone numbers of the Florida elections officials was discovered by an independent researcher who reported it to The Washington Post on the condition of anonymity, out of fear of becoming a target of online attacks. The Post reviewed all the relevant pages.\n\nSnipes expressed shock and concern that her personal information had been publicized. \u201cThat's crazy because I have not done anything wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cWe had an excellent election with record turnout. And then it turns into this ugly monster because it gets political.\"\n\nBucher declined to comment.\n\nSnipes has been the target of attacks from Trump, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and others in recent days and also been the focus of critical stories in popular conservative publications such as Breitbart News. Protesters outside the Broward elections office have cried \u201cLock her up!\u201d in an echo from Trump campaign rallies where Hillary Clinton was the foil.\n\nSeber Newsome III, 61, an Army veteran and retired postal service employee from Nassau County, Fla., appears to have been the first to post information online about Snipes and Bucher. He described himself as a former Democrat who became a Trump supporter in 2016 and has monitored last week\u2019s Florida election aftermath mainly on Fox News.\n\nNewsome said he found the personal information for Snipes and Bucher in online searches and was merely attempting to encourage people to write letters or call them to register displeasure to how the recount is being conducted. He said he would not favor people appearing at their homes to protest.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all public,\u201d said Newsome. \u201cI didn\u2019t break no law.\u201d\n\nFacebook said in a statement, \u201cThe sharing of personal information like this is not permitted on our platform and we have removed multiple instances of such information being shared. As we find similar instances, we will also remove those.\u201d\n\nNewsome said that Facebook limited his ability to post new messages Tuesday morning as punishment for violating its policies. Newsome called it \u201cFacebook jail\u201d and said he wished he had published the addresses and phone numbers for the elections offices instead. His Facebook page has many references to the Confederacy and images of the Confederate battle flag, which Newsome said was an attempt to honor his family heritage.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, Facebook said that Newsome has been banned from the platform entirely for these and other violations of company rules.\n\nThe information about Snipes also appeared on Facebook groups called \u201cTRUMP TRAIN-MAGA Fan Club,\u201d \u201cConfederate Resistance,\u201d \u201cTrump=Truth (c),\u201d and \u201cTRUE AMERICANS UNITE FOR PRES. DONALD TRUMP.\u201d Together these four groups have more than 47,000 members. Several of the members of these groups cheered Newsome for publishing information on Snipes.\n\nOn Twitter, the home address for Snipes appeared in tweets from an account under the name \u201cRandom Shmo,\u201d with the profile image featuring a white man in a jacket and tie with his face blurred. The account profile says, \u201cAverage Shmo, Single father of 3 Let Morals, Values, & Ethics guide you. Same rules of law for Gov. as We The People. Drain the Swamp! #WakeUp.\u201d\n\nA message seeking comment from this account was not returned.\n\nPublic criticisms of Snipes grew intense last week when Gov. Rick Scott, who at first appeared to narrowly win his campaign for a U.S. Senate seat against incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson, declared in a news conference from the governor\u2019s mansion that Snipes \u201chas a history of acting in absolute bad faith.\u201d Rubio and former Florida governor Jeb Bush have called for her ouster.\n\nA pro-Trump political committee says it is spending $250,000 on an ad attacking Snipes on television in southern and central Florida and online. \u201cLegal voters in Florida are outraged, and Brenda Snipes must be removed,\u201d says the ad by Great America PAC, which suggests blatant fraud but offers no evidence. \u201cWhen we can\u2019t trust our elections, we don\u2019t have a democracy.\u201d\n\nSnipes, a former educator, was appointed by Bush, a Republican, in 2003 after he ousted her predecessor for mismanagement. She has since has been reelected four times.\n\nHer tenure has been marred by controversy. During the 2004 presidential election, Snipes blamed the U.S. Postal Service for losing 58,000 absentee ballots, then later announced that only 6,000 ballots had disappeared. Postal officials said they had done nothing wrong. Then Snipes\u2019s office dropped off 2,400 blank absentee ballots for voters at the post office on a Saturday before the election, after mail carriers were already gone for the day.\n\nIn 2016, Snipes was accused of destroying the physical ballots in a congressional race while saving digital copies as a lawsuit was pending \u2014 a violation of a federal statute requiring that congressional ballots be saved for 22 months after an election.\n\nIn an interview Sunday, as the recount was getting underway, Snipes said she was hoping the controversy would blow over.

Reinhard reported from Lauderhill, Fla.", "This post has been updated.\n\nCNN announced Tuesday that it will sue the White House over reporter Jim Acosta\u2019s press pass being revoked. And importantly, the White House now seems to be changing its tune about exactly why it sanctioned Acosta.\n\nIn a statement Tuesday morning, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders suggested that the decision was about Acosta refusing to yield the microphone while questioning the president:\n\nWe have been advised that CNN has filed a complaint challenging the suspension of Jim Acosta\u2019s hard pass. This is just more grandstanding from CNN, and we will vigorously defend against this lawsuit. CNN, who has nearly 50 additional hard pass holders, and Mr. Acosta is no more or less special than any other media outlet or reporter with respect to the First Amendment. After Mr. Acosta asked the President two questions \u2014 each of which the President answered \u2014 he physically refused to surrender a White House microphone to an intern, so that other reporters might ask their questions. This was not the first time this reporter has inappropriately refused to yield to other reporters. The White House cannot run an orderly and fair press conference when a reporter acts this way, which is neither appropriate nor professional. The First Amendment is not served when a single reporter, of more than 150 present, attempts to monopolize the floor. If there is no check on this type of behavior it impedes the ability of the President, the White House staff, and members of the media to conduct business.\u201d\n\nBut that\u2019s different from the initial justifications offered by the White House for revoking Acosta\u2019s press pass. Less than a week ago, it was primarily about him supposedly placing his hands on and getting too rough with an intern.\n\nSanders said at the time that the White House would \u201cnever tolerate a reporter placing his hands on a young woman.\u201d Only after that was mentioned did Sanders add as an addendum: \u201cIt is also completely disrespectful to the reporter\u2019s colleagues not to allow them an opportunity to ask a question.\u201d\n\nThis conduct is absolutely unacceptable. It is also completely disrespectful to the reporter\u2019s colleagues not to allow them an opportunity to ask a question. President Trump has given the press more access than any President in history. \u2014 Sarah Sanders (@PressSec) November 8, 2018\n\nThe day after the altercation, White House director of strategic communications Mercedes Schlapp doubled down on the idea that Acosta was being punished for an alleged physical altercation.\n\n\u201cLook, I think it\u2019s important to show that Jim Acosta did place his hands on this White House staffer,\u201d Schlapp said on Fox News. \u201cShe\u2019s young, she was shaken up, she was intimidated by what Jim Acosta did. What we are seeing is bad behavior that cannot be tolerated and, in fact, there\u2019s been several reporters who have shared their viewpoints about \u2014 privately about Jim Acosta where he\u2019s being so disrespectful that other reporters don\u2019t have a chance to ask a question. This behavior is not going to be tolerated.\u201d\n\nAgain, Schlapp seemed to suggest that the alleged journalistic sin was secondary and that it was really about what Acosta did to the intern.\n\nBy this time, of course, it had been established that not only did the video of the incident not show Acosta placing his hands on the intern but that Sanders herself shared a doctored video of it that was sped up to make Acosta\u2019s movement look more aggressive than it was.\n\nFaced with that evidence, Sanders on Thursday again defended the decision in the context of the altercation, rather than Acosta simply hogging the microphone.\n\n\u201cThe question is: Did the reporter make contact or not?\u201d Sanders said. \u201cThe video is clear \u2014 he did. We stand by our statement.\u201d\n\nBy Friday, President Trump himself was still litigating the video. \u201cNobody manipulated it. Give me a break,\u201d he said. \u201cSee, that\u2019s just dishonest reporting. All that is is a close-up. See, that\u2019s just \u2014 that is just dishonest reporting. I watched that. I heard that last night. They made it close up. They showed it close up, and he was not nice to that young woman.\u201d\n\nThe new White House statement does say that Acosta \u201cphysically refused to surrender a White House microphone to an intern.\u201d But that\u2019s not accusing him of violence or placing his hands on the intern. That could simply be him refusing to let go. The statement is also completely different from the initial ones in its emphasis on Acosta\u2019s alleged journalistic sins.\n\nSo why no mention of Acosta\u2019s allegedly violent behavior in the latest statement? As The Post\u2019s Deanna Paul writes, that would actually be a compelling reason for his access to be revoked:\n\nThere are situations where a journalist\u2019s access to a news conference can be effectively stripped, though they are rare, [First Amendment lawyer Floyd] Abrams said. For example, if a journalist is an ongoing threat to people present in the area, the government has a legitimate argument to take away his or her access.\n\nSo conceding this wasn\u2019t about Acosta laying his hands on an intern would seem to throw in the towel on a potent argument.\n\nPossibly that\u2019s because the White House recognizes that, while the argument that Acosta was being violent might wash with the president\u2019s base, basically, no court would ever agree. The alleged assault simply isn\u2019t there, and the fact that the White House needed to use sped-up video \u2014 what can only be called propaganda \u2014 to bolster its point shows how shaky the foundations of the decision and its initial justifications were.\n\nThat the White House isn\u2019t sticking with that version when faced with legal action shows how dodgy it was to begin with.", "\n\nBroward County Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes has been the target of \"doxing,\" or the publication online of her home address and phone number. (AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee)\n\nSeveral pro-Trump Facebook pages and one Twitter account on Monday posted the home address and phone number of the Broward County, Fla., election supervisor who has been the target of blistering criticism from the president and other Republicans amid highly politicized vote recounts.\n\nPosting the home address of Elections Supervisor Brenda Snipes \u2014 a tactic called \u201cdoxing\u201d \u2014 often is a step toward harassment of people in the public spotlight and is prohibited by Facebook, Twitter and most other online platforms. The incident came amid rising vilification of the top election official in Florida\u2019s most Democratic county as the state recounts closely fought elections for the governorship and U.S. Senate.\n\nFacebook confirmed Tuesday that it had removed personal information about Snipes after the incident was reported to the company. It also confirmed a similar incident involving Palm Beach County\u2019s Elections Supervisor Susan Bucher, whose home address and phone number also were posted on a Facebook page.\n\nTwitter declined to comment. Two tweets from an account visible Tuesday morning were deleted by noon.\n\nThe posting of the home addresses and phone numbers of the Florida elections officials was discovered by an independent researcher who reported it to The Washington Post on the condition of anonymity, out of fear of becoming a target of online attacks. The Post reviewed all the relevant pages.\n\nSnipes expressed shock and concern that her personal information had been publicized. \u201cThat's crazy because I have not done anything wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cWe had an excellent election with record turnout. And then it turns into this ugly monster because it gets political.\"\n\nBucher declined to comment.\n\nSnipes has been the target of attacks from Trump, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and others in recent days and also been the focus of critical stories in popular conservative publications such as Breitbart News. Protesters outside the Broward elections office have cried \u201cLock her up!\u201d in an echo from Trump campaign rallies where Hillary Clinton was the foil.\n\nSeber Newsome III, 61, an Army veteran and retired postal service employee from Nassau County, Fla., appears to have been the first to post information online about Snipes and Bucher. He described himself as a former Democrat who became a Trump supporter in 2016 and has monitored last week\u2019s Florida election aftermath mainly on Fox News.\n\nNewsome said he found the personal information for Snipes and Bucher in online searches and was merely attempting to encourage people to write letters or call them to register displeasure to how the recount is being conducted. He said he would not favor people appearing at their homes to protest.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all public,\u201d said Newsome. \u201cI didn\u2019t break no law.\u201d\n\nFacebook said in a statement, \u201cThe sharing of personal information like this is not permitted on our platform and we have removed multiple instances of such information being shared. As we find similar instances, we will also remove those.\u201d\n\nNewsome said that Facebook limited his ability to post new messages Tuesday morning as punishment for violating its policies. Newsome called it \u201cFacebook jail\u201d and said he wished he had published the addresses and phone numbers for the elections offices instead. His Facebook page has many references to the Confederacy and images of the Confederate battle flag, which Newsome said was an attempt to honor his family heritage.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, Facebook said that Newsome has been banned from the platform entirely for these and other violations of company rules.\n\nThe information about Snipes also appeared on Facebook groups called \u201cTRUMP TRAIN-MAGA Fan Club,\u201d \u201cConfederate Resistance,\u201d \u201cTrump=Truth (c),\u201d and \u201cTRUE AMERICANS UNITE FOR PRES. DONALD TRUMP.\u201d Together these four groups have more than 47,000 members. Several of the members of these groups cheered Newsome for publishing information on Snipes.\n\nOn Twitter, the home address for Snipes appeared in tweets from an account under the name \u201cRandom Shmo,\u201d with the profile image featuring a white man in a jacket and tie with his face blurred. The account profile says, \u201cAverage Shmo, Single father of 3 Let Morals, Values, & Ethics guide you. Same rules of law for Gov. as We The People. Drain the Swamp! #WakeUp.\u201d\n\nA message seeking comment from this account was not returned.\n\nPublic criticisms of Snipes grew intense last week when Gov. Rick Scott, who at first appeared to narrowly win his campaign for a U.S. Senate seat against incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson, declared in a news conference from the governor\u2019s mansion that Snipes \u201chas a history of acting in absolute bad faith.\u201d Rubio and former Florida governor Jeb Bush have called for her ouster.\n\nA pro-Trump political committee says it is spending $250,000 on an ad attacking Snipes on television in southern and central Florida and online. \u201cLegal voters in Florida are outraged, and Brenda Snipes must be removed,\u201d says the ad by Great America PAC, which suggests blatant fraud but offers no evidence. \u201cWhen we can\u2019t trust our elections, we don\u2019t have a democracy.\u201d\n\nSnipes, a former educator, was appointed by Bush, a Republican, in 2003 after he ousted her predecessor for mismanagement. She has since has been reelected four times.\n\nHer tenure has been marred by controversy. During the 2004 presidential election, Snipes blamed the U.S. Postal Service for losing 58,000 absentee ballots, then later announced that only 6,000 ballots had disappeared. Postal officials said they had done nothing wrong. Then Snipes\u2019s office dropped off 2,400 blank absentee ballots for voters at the post office on a Saturday before the election, after mail carriers were already gone for the day.\n\nIn 2016, Snipes was accused of destroying the physical ballots in a congressional race while saving digital copies as a lawsuit was pending \u2014 a violation of a federal statute requiring that congressional ballots be saved for 22 months after an election.\n\nIn an interview Sunday, as the recount was getting underway, Snipes said she was hoping the controversy would blow over. She acknowledged her office has made some mistakes, including the destruction of ballots in 2016. But she also pointed to accomplishments such as expanding the number of early-voting sites from nine to 22 locations.\n\n\u201cI do want the voters to think about my overall record and not look and just one or two things,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve always been a Democrat, but I don\u2019t run this office as a partisan operation.\u201d\n\nSnipes, who is African American, said she wondered if her gender or race was fueling the attacks. \u201cI\u2019m one of the few black women in this position so I have to wonder if that is a factor,\u201d she said.\n\nIon Sancho, who recently retired as an elections supervisor in northern Florida after three decades, said of the Broward elections office: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing criminal going on here.

The bridge is included in the deal Virginia, Arlington and Alexandria made with Amazon. (CC2DCA)\n\nOver a decade, a once-industrial Seattle neighborhood transformed into a burgeoning commuter hub with streetcar and bus connections, bus lanes, cyclists and private shuttles ferrying employees to the complex of buildings that comprise the headquarters for the online retail giant Amazon.com.\n\nAmong workers in that city\u2019s South Lake Union neighborhood, about 30 percent of commuters take public transit, nearly a fifth walk to work, around 15 percent carpool or van-pool, and many others bike, according to data compiled in state-required surveys. One in 5 who work for Amazon walk to their jobs. Amazon employees\u2019 transit costs are fully covered by company-subsidized passes. (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\n\nNow as attention shifts to Crystal City in Arlington, Va. which will split Amazon\u2019s second headquarters with New York, the question becomes whether South Lake Union\u2019s commuting successes \u2014 what the transit industry calls \u201cmode split\u201d \u2014 can be replicated 2,300 miles across the country.\n\n[Amazon splits headquarters prize between Crystal City and New York]\n\n\u201cI would certainly hope it\u2019s replicable \u2014 the numbers are pretty good,\u201d said Andrew Glass Hastings, former director of transit and mobility for the Seattle Department of Transportation. \u201cThey have certainly set a precedent in Seattle, and that precedent is working, so I would certainly hope they try to apply the same logic to any place they choose to locate.\u201d\n\nAmazon\u2019s move to Crystal City \u2014 or National Landing, as the company will re-brand the area where it will build its hub \u2014 could have a dramatic impact on the transportation network in a region that already has some of the worst traffic in the country and a subway grappling with falling ridership.\n\nVirginia, Arlington and Alexandria said they were spending more than half a billion dollars to support Amazon\u2019s plans, much of it on existing projects. The plans included an additional entrance to the Crystal City Metro station and a second entrance for the planned Potomac Yard station.\n\nThe plans also include a pedestrian bridge from Reagan National Airport to Crystal City and a transit-way expansion in a corridor with the region\u2019s only bus rapid transit system, along with improvements to Route 1.\n\n[Amazon to benefit from over $2.8 billion in incentives from Va., N.Y., Tenn.]\n\nArlington and Alexandria\u2019s pledged investments totaled $570 million, while Virginia said it was investing $195 million in improvements; the funding would go to new projects and the expansion of existing ones. The plan would tie new transportation funding levels from the state to the number of jobs Amazon creates.\n\nUnlike in Seattle, where voters rejected a federally subsidized mass-transit system that was ultimately awarded to Atlanta in the 1970s, the Washington region already has an extensive rail system \u2014 one that could use an influx of riders.\n\nBut it is a delicate balance. A traffic meltdown during a partial Metro shutdown including National Airport this past weekend highlighted what can happen when one part of the network breaks down and the system becomes overwhelmed.\n\nStill, the potential of thousands of new riders is welcome news for the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, which has seen declining Metro ridership cut into operating revenue, leading to service cuts and higher fares for the system\u2019s 600,000 average weekday riders.\n\n[Traffic chaos reported around National Airport as Metro service stops]\n\nMetro General Manager Paul J. Wiedefeld said Amazon officials made a point of riding Metro when they were touring the area during site visits. \u201cTo me that sent a signal that they were extremely serious about transit and they were extremely serious about Metro\u2019s role in the region,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt just further supports the need for investment,\u201d Wiedefeld said. \u201cIt supports the need that we have to improve the service. It supports the need to expand the service where we can. And so I think from that perspective it is getting us to where we all want to be with the transit system.\u201d\n\nWiedefeld did not rule out the possibility of a station name change to go along with Amazon\u2019s re-branding of the area as National Landing, though he said station names are typically geographical or landmark-based and any decision was \u201cto be determined.\u201d\n\nExperts and transit advocates hope the need to eventually serve 25,000 employees and potentially their families could speed up needed transportation projects and lead to improvements in a corridor along Metro\u2019s Blue and Yellow lines that is served by an international airport; subway, bus and commuter rail service; bus rapid transit; and several major highways that feed into the District.\n\nA new 900-foot pedestrian bridge linking National Airport to Crystal City would make it perhaps the most prominent U.S. airport accessible on foot and establish it as an \u201c \u2018aerotropolis\u2019 connecting an estimated 10,000 airport passengers to Crystal City per month,\u201d according to a feasibility study issued by the Crystal City Business Improvement District in February.\n\nThe project would cost $16 million to $38 million (depending on whether it is a bridge or tunnel), according to the study. The Crystal City BID held two public meetings on the bridge study late last year and found the project was feasible, identifying federal, state, regional and local sources of potential funding.\n\n[How can the D.C. region absorb Amazon if it can\u2019t cope now with gridlock and housing costs?]\n\n\u201cAmazon was looking for an urban and transit-oriented environment, and they certainly have found one in the most pro-transit, pro-smart-growth jurisdiction in the country in Arlington County,\u201d said Stewart Schwartz, executive director of the Coalition for Smarter Growth. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing in that we would be focusing these jobs where we have excellent transit and close to the core of the region so that the jobs are accessible 360 degrees around.\u201d\n\nSchwartz noted an added benefit: Amazon\u2019s selection of Crystal City could lead to a new \u201creverse commute\u201d in which riders are filling empty trains headed outbound from the District \u2014 in the opposite direction of rush-hour travel.\n\nAdvocates say the region\u2019s selection is a testament to its robust transit coverage and presents an argument for adding service at a time when chronic reliability problems are sending Metro riders to other modes. But it comes with inherent risks \u2014 of exacerbating gridlock, crowding Metro lines on a system unprepared for the surge of riders or sending more commuters back to the roads via ride-hail services and driving.\n\nD.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) called Amazon\u2019s choice of Crystal City a \u201cwin for D.C.\u201d but highlighted Metro as a priority for improvement.\n\n\u201cWe must continue our investment in safety, reliability, and capacity at Metro and find ways to enhance service, including late night service,\u201d Bowser said in statement.\n\nD.C. Council member Charles Allen (D-Ward 6) said the top priority for the city should be planning for infrastructure and transportation overhauls.\n\n\u201cIf 25,000 jobs means 25,000 more cars, transportation is not going to work,\u201d Allen said. \u201cWhile it provides a whole lot of opportunity, there\u2019s a whole lot of risk and a whole lot of challenges when it comes to investments that are going to be needed so we aren\u2019t moving everyone around by cars.\u201d\n\n[Washington won its piece of Amazon\u2019s HQ2. Now comes the hard part.]\n\nAnalysts say there is also no guarantee that new workers and their families will choose Metro.\n\n\u201cMetro has really got to become its own best advocate by having the kind of services they used to have,\u201d said Paul Mackie, director of research and communications for Mobility Lab, the research arm of Arlington County Commuter Services. \u201cMetro has to make itself really attractive to get them to choose Metro over the many other options perhaps people are finding more attractive at this point.\u201d\n\nA recent internal Metro report highlighted population and jobs near stations as the top factors driving rail ridership. That makes Amazon a potential windfall.\n\n\u201cFor every 10 percent increase in population within a half-mile of stations, ridership is expected to increase by 2.4 to 3.1 percent,\u201d the report said.\n\n[Where Bezos\u2019s jet flies most \u2014 and what it might say about Amazon\u2019s headquarters plan]\n\nAmazon has historically given generous transit incentives to its workers and in Seattle has even provided operating funds \u2014 spending $1.5 million to increase bus frequency and ease crowding in popular corridors in the city.\n\n\u201cI think it will be a very big plus for Metro, because we\u2019ll have more riders, more people who want to ride Metro,\u201d said Jack Evans, chair of the Metro board. \u201cAnd Metro, then, is going to have to be in a position to deliver.\u201d\n\nWhile few details were available on the transportation plans \u2014 aside from short summaries \u2014 the feasibility study laid out in detail the benefit officials said the pedestrian bridge could bring.\n\n\u201cA new pedestrian connection would enable travelers to avoid potential road congestion or long waits on Metro with an enjoyable, 5-minute walk,\u201d the study said. \u201cIt would also harness the multitude of transportation assets in Crystal City, seamlessly link them together into a multimodal hub, and position the neighborhood to attract additional rail service operations such as Amtrak, regional commuter rail, and even a future high-speed rail station.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the head of the Transportation Security Administration, David Pekoske, said a $1 billion project underway to build a new commuter concourse and expand and modernize security checkpoints at National Airport is well-timed and \u201cwill certainly help\u201d any additional passenger traffic generated by Amazon\u2019s expansion.\n\nAdvocates were bullish on other potential improvements. For example, Schwartz said Amazon\u2019s arrival could lead to the expansion of dedicated bus lanes for Metroway, the bus rapid transit system linking Arlington and Alexandria that already has its own right of way in the most congested corridors. Smart-growth advocates are pushing for Virginia Railway Express station upgrades to expand capacity and service, along with better bike connections in the vicinity of the new headquarters and the linking of the Metroway system with other bus rapid transit, such as the recently approved Richmond Highway Bus Rapid Transit in Fairfax County.\n\nWhether Metro is able to capi\u00adtal\u00adize on the additional riders, officials say the impact of just the potential of Amazon choosing the Washington region is clear.\n\n[Amazon tours D.C., Maryland and Virginia in search for new headquarters]\n\n\u201cAmazon was the impetus that certainly turned Maryland in supporting the dedicated funding,\u201d Evans said. \u201cI think Amazon was the catalyst that got Maryland and to some extent Virginia on board.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) disputed that characterization, however, saying Amazon\u2019s search and Hogan\u2019s position on Metro funding were unrelated.\n\nAffordable-housing advocates have warned that the arrival of tens of thousands of high-income workers could displace residents in and near Arlington and drive up rents, sending some residents to car-dependent suburbs and worsening gridlock. Meanwhile, some fear under that scenario that well-paid workers would turn to a mode of transportation they have been shown to prefer \u2014 ride-hailing. A Seattle Times analysis published this month identified South Lake Union as one of the city\u2019s most popular neighborhoods for Uber and Lyft.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s certainly going to be a major factor,\u201d Seattle\u2019s Glass Hastings said. \u201cIf people can\u2019t access transit easily, if people can\u2019t walk or bike, Lyft and Uber are very prevalent in that area, as well.\u201d\n\nLori Aratani and Fenit Nirappil contributed to this report.", "FILE - In this May 23, 2018 file photo, Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen speaks during a roundtable on immigration policy with President Donald Trump at Morrelly Homeland Security Center, in Bethpage, N.Y. President Donald Trump has soured on Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and she is expected to leave her job as soon as this week. That\u2019s according to two people who spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity. (Evan Vucci/Associated Press)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump is weighing an administration-wide shakeup as he looks to prepare his White House for divided government, with Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen expected to be among the next to go, perhaps as soon as this week.\n\nTrump has soured on Nielsen and White House chief of staff John Kelly, in part over frustration that his administration is not doing more to address what he has called a crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border, according to two people with knowledge of the issue. But the scope of the contemplated changes is far broader, as Trump gears up for a wave of Democratic oversight requests and to devote more effort to his own re-election campaign.\n\nAccording to people familiar with the situation, Trump is discussing replacing Kelly with Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s chief of staff, Nick Ayers. Kelly, a retired Marine general, has been credited with bringing order and process to a chaotic West Wing, but he has fallen out of favor with the president as well as presidential daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n\nAyers, a seasoned campaign operative, would restore a political-mindset to the role, but he faces stiff opposition from some corners of the West Wing, with some aides lobbying Trump directly against the move.\n\nOther changes are afoot, as Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke are being discussed for replacement. And in an extraordinary move Tuesday, first lady Melania Trump\u2019s office called publicly for the firing of Trump\u2019s deputy national security adviser, Mira Ricardel.\n\nFor all of the talk of churn, Trump often expresses frustration with aides and then does not take action. Talk of Kelly\u2019s exit has percolated for months and he remains in place.\n\nNielsen had hoped to complete one year in the job and leave in December, but it appeared unlikely she would last that long, said two sources. Both people who had knowledge of the debate spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nCurbing illegal immigration is Trump\u2019s signature issue \u2014 and one he returns to as a way to rally his most loyal supporters.\n\nBut anyone who takes over at Homeland Security is likely to run up against the same problems that Nielsen faced. The administration has already tried to clamp down at the border but those efforts have been largely thwarted or watered down due to legal challenges.\n\nTrump also told allies that he never fully trusted Nielsen, whom he associated with President George W. Bush, a longtime foe. And he told those close to him that he felt, at times, that her loyalty was more toward her longtime mentor \u2014 Kelly \u2014 than to the president.\n\nZinke, who faces several ethics investigations, said in interview with The Associated Press on Monday that he has spoken in recent days with Trump, Pence and Kelly about probes into his leadership and they remain supportive. He denied any wrongdoing.\n\nRoss addressed turnover rumors at a Yahoo! Finance summit Tuesday, saying he was in the post to give back to the country and support Trump.\n\n\u201cI worked very hard to get President Trump elected,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I\u2019d like to work equally hard to have him succeed and be re-elected.\u201d\n\nQuestions about Nielsen\u2019s job security are not new. Earlier this year, she pushed back on a New York Times report that she drafted a resignation letter but did not submit it, after Trump scolded her at a Cabinet meeting.\n\nNielsen has led the sprawling post-9/11 federal agency since December. She had been chief of staff to Kelly when he was Trump\u2019s first Homeland Security secretary. A DHS spokesman would not comment on whether she was leaving.\n\n\u201cThe secretary is honored to lead the men and women of DHS and is committed to implementing the president\u2019s security-focused agenda to protect Americans from all threats and will continue to do so,\u201d spokesman Tyler Houlton said.\n\nNielsen advocated for strong cybersecurity defense, and often said she believed the next terror major attack would occur online \u2014 not by planes or bombs. She was tasked with helping states secure elections following interference by Russians during the 2016 election.\n\nShe pushed Trump\u2019s immigration policies, including funding for his border wall and defended the administration\u2019s practice of separating children from parents, telling a Senate committee that removing children from parents facing criminal charges happens \u201cin the United States every day.\u201d But she was also instrumental in stopping the separations.\n\nJust last week, the administration announced that migrants would be denied asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border if they crossed illegally, creating regulations that circumvent immigration laws stating anyone can claim asylum no matter how they arrive to the country. The decision would affect about 70,000 people annually and was immediately challenged by the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nNielsen also moved to abandon longstanding regulations that dictate how long children are allowed to be held in immigration detention, and requested bed space from the U.S. military for some 12,000 people in an effort to detain all families who cross the border. Right now there is space for about 3,000 families and they are at capacity.\n\nShe got into heated discussions with Trump and White House aides several times over immigration policy, as she sought to explain the complicated legal challenges behind immigration law and pushed for a more diplomatic approach.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear who would replace her. The job requires Senate confirmation and there is no deputy secretary. Under Secretary for Management Claire Grady would be the acting head if Nielsen left.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press Writers Darlene Superville in Washington and Jonathan Lemire in New York contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Improvements will be made to the Crystal City Metro station, Amazon said. (Cliff Owen/AP)\n\nAmazon will benefit from government subsidies and investments totaling more than $2.4 billion from Virginia, New York and Tennessee to build its new facilities, spurring complaints that taxpayers shouldn\u2019t be subsidizing one of the nation\u2019s most prosperous companies.\n\nA big gap in the size of incentives promised by New York and Virginia also stirred concern in the Empire State \u2014 and quiet satisfaction in the Old Dominion \u2014 that Richmond had cut a better deal than Albany. In the largest single subsidy offered by each state, New York offered tax credits equal to $48,000 per new job, while Virginia agreed to workforce cash grants of $22,000 per job.\n\nThe incentives packages also worried affordable housing activists that too little was promised to deal with the potential effect on housing costs of an influx of tens of thousands of new employees with an average salary of more than $150,000 a year.\n\nIt\u2019s normal for job-hungry state and local governments to offer tax credits, grants and other incentives to lure companies, and the contest for Amazon\u2019s second headquarters, HQ2 \u2014 widely seen as the biggest economic development prize in a generation \u2014 was no exception.\n\nBut the prospect of granting hundreds of millions of dollars of subsidies to a company led by the world\u2019s richest man \u2014 Amazon CEO and founder Jeffrey P. Bezos \u2014 also drew condemnation in some quarters. (Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\n\nTwo New York lawmakers representing constituents in Long Island City, where one of the two new Amazon headquarters will be located, have pledged to oppose the deal.\n\n\u201cWe are witness to a cynical game in which Amazon duped New York into offering unprecedented amounts of tax dollars to one of the wealthiest companies on Earth for a promise of jobs that would represent less than 3% of the jobs typically created in our city over a 10 year period,\u201d state Sen. Michael Gianaris and City Council Member Jimmy Van Bramer said in a joint statement issued after the announcement.\n\nThe total of incentives for Amazon \u2014 including direct subsidies and public investments designed to help attract the company \u2014 appeared to be considerably less than the package of up to $8.5 billion offered by Maryland and $7 billion by New Jersey. That suggested that factors such as access to talent and airports, and overall business climate, were more important for the company.\n\n[Amazon splits prize between Arlington and New York]\n\nNew York was the most generous among the winners, promising more than $1.5 billion in direct subsidies for Amazon provided it creates at least 25,000 jobs in Long Island City, which is in Queens across the East River from Midtown Manhattan.\n\nVirginia appeared to have made a better deal, as the state and Arlington County offered direct subsidies of $573 million for 25,000 jobs to place the other new headquarters near Reagan National Airport in what will now be called National Landing.\n\nVirginia and Arlington also pledged investments totaling $223 million for transportation improvements including upgrading two Metro stations \u2014 an incentive that will help Amazon and the rest of the community.\n\nMost of the incentives are conditional on Amazon delivering the 25,000 new high-paying jobs. The promised salary of $150,000 a year is an increase from the $100,000 salaries that Amazon originally guaranteed. Both New York and Virginia offered additional subsidies if the company creates more than 25,000 jobs.\n\nNashville, a surprise last-minute addition to Amazon\u2019s plan, promised $102 million in subsidies for a new operations center with 5,000 jobs.\n\nIn describing its rationale for picking Northern Virginia and New York to share the top prize, Amazon stressed that access to tech talent was paramount.\n\n[Look at the agreement between Va. and Amazon]\n\n\u201cWe were looking for a location with strong local and regional talent \u2014 particularly in software development and related fields,\u201d the company statement said.\n\nTalent would not necessarily explain the choice of Northern Virginia over Maryland\u2019s Montgomery County, however, as the two are across the Potomac River from each other and in the same metropolitan area.\n\nHowever, Northern Virginia is widely seen as more business-friendly than Montgomery County, partly because Virginia is a right-to-work state, where it is prohibited to require membership in a union as a condition of employment. Also, Amazon said it wanted good access to airports, and the Arlington site is a half-mile from Reagan National Airport, whereas the Montgomery County site would have been more than a 30-minute drive from that airport.\n\nIn Virginia, the bulk of the direct incentives will come in the form of workforce cash grants from the state of up to $550 million, based on $22,000 for each job created over the next 12 years.\n\nThe state will also invest $195 million in infrastructure in the neighborhood, including improvements to the Crystal City and Potomac Yards Metro stations and a pedestrian bridge connecting the Amazon site to Reagan National Airport. The Potomac Yards station is not yet open.\n\nFrom Arlington, Amazon will receive a cash grant of $23 million over 15 years linked to incremental growth of the tax on hotel rooms. The county also will dedicate about $28 million of future property tax revenue for on-site infrastructure and open space at the site.\n\nThe Virginia General Assembly will have to approve the Amazon subsidies, but legislators predicted they would win passage. The Arlington County Board will take up the package in February.\n\n[Washington won its piece of Amazon\u2019s HQ2. Now comes the hard part.]\n\nAlthough it is not a direct subsidy, Virginia\u2019s effort to secure Amazon also included an ambitious plan to spend nearly $1.1 billion over 20 years to expand tech higher education in the state. Amazon said this was an initiative by the state and not something that the company proposed.\n\nOne aim is to raise the number of bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees awarded in the computer sciences and related fields by 25,000 to 35,000 over the next two decades, beyond what was already forecast. The plan includes construction by Virginia Tech of a graduate campus focused on innovation in Alexandria, and expansion of George Mason University\u2019s tech program in Arlington.\n\nVirginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) described the package as \u201ca new model of economic development for the 21st century.\u201d\n\nOne provision in Virginia\u2019s package is not financial at all. Virginia agreed to give Amazon at least two days notice if the media or the public filed a Freedom of Information Act request about the agreement. This would \u201callow the Company to seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy.\u201d\n\nNew York\u2019s package included direct state incentives of $1.2 billion, most of which is to be provided via a refundable tax credit equivalent to $48,000 per job over the next 10 years.\n\nNew York also offered a cash grant of $325 million based on the square footage of buildings occupied in the next 10 years.\n\nIn addition, Amazon will benefit from two other New York City incentive programs, which are available to all companies.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t immediately clear why New York had offered so much more in incentives than Virginia. New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) defended the incentives by saying that the total state and city revenue is estimated at $27.5 billion, which he said would be about nine times larger than the incentives.\n\nVirginia\u2019s top economic development official, who led negotiations with Amazon, said his state historically has been less generous than others in granting subsidies.\n\n\u201cVirginia is generally a relatively low-incentive state, typically the lowest incentives in the South,\u201d said Stephen Moret, director of the Virginia Economic Development Partnership.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to win this in a Virginia way, and that was more about emphasizing our assets, in particular our stable, competitive business climate and our outstanding education systems,\u201d Moret said.\n\nHe said that the total incentive package was cut by half when Amazon decided to change its original plan to build a single new headquarters with 50,000 jobs.\n\nBut even with the shrinkage in the size of the prize, Moret said, the state estimates that the increased revenue in personal income taxes and sales taxes over 20 years will be so high that the net gain for the state\u2019s general fund will total $3.2 billion after paying the incentives.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a gusher\u201d of tax revenue, he said.\n\nAffordable housing activists hope that some of that revenue will ultimately go to offset the expected negative effect on rents and home prices. They were displeased that while Virginia and Arlington offered large sums for transportation improvements to deal with congestion, the package did not include any new money earmarked for housing.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s excitement that HQ2 is coming but concern that there is not more than has seemingly been committed for low- and moderate-income folks for housing,\u201d said David Bowers, vice president and Mid-Atlantic market leader for Enterprise Community Partners. \u201cIt\u2019s a challenge moment for regional leaders \u2014 public and private sector \u2014 to determine whether we will proactively make investments at the scale of need to meet the region\u2019s housing affordability challenges.\u201d\n\nMichael Laris and Taylor Telford contributed to this report.", "\n\nChristian Cantrell, 18, casts his vote for the first time in Charlotte on Nov. 6. (Logan Cyrus/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nOpinion writer\n\nNever in my lifetime have an American president and his party tried so hard to discredit the results of democratic elections, thereby attempting to affect the outcome and/or deprive opponents of legitimacy if they win. The Post reports:\n\nRepublicans are sowing skepticism about the electoral process in states with votes that are too close to call, echoing President Trump\u2019s unsubstantiated allegations of voter fraud and suggesting that election officials should jettison the common practice of completing vote counts after Election Day. Nowhere is the effort more aggressive than in Florida, where Gov. Rick Scott is tapping the powers of his administration to defend his slender lead in the U.S. Senate race and accusing Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson of \u201ctrying to steal an election.\u201d Without evidence, Trump on Twitter claimed ballots were \u201cmassively infected\u201d in Florida and said the recount should halt \u2014 though it is mandated by state law and overseas military ballots aren\u2019t due until Friday. What appears to be a coordinated Republican strategy to undercut post-election vote counting is also evident in New Mexico, where Rep. Yvette Herrell (R) is refusing to concede her race to Democrat Xochitl Torres Small after absentee ballots changed her status from winner to loser, and in Arizona, where the National Republican Senatorial Committee contended a county election official had been \u201cusing his position to cook the books\u201d for Democrat Kyrsten Sinema.\n\nThe effort was utterly unsuccessful in Arizona, where Rep. Martha McSally (R) on Monday conceded the race. Ironically, Scott \u2014 who leads in the Florida Senate race \u2014 is likely to prevail but will have diminished the credibility of his own victory by fanning allegations of wrongdoing.\n\nRepublicans\u2019 assault on democracy goes further. Both Scott in Florida and Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp have attempted to remain involved in the vote-counting in their own races. Kemp\u2019s attempt created a backlash, prompted a lawsuit filed by the group Protect Democracy and a rare retreat for Republicans when he gave up his secretary of state title, thereby removing himself from the vote-counting in a race too close to call. (Previously, Kemp had engaged in widespread efforts to purge voters, close polling places and disqualify absentee ballots and voter applications \u2014 all of which served to suppress the votes of nonwhites and the poor.)\n\nLikewise in Florida, good-government advocates are suing to get Scott to remove himself from the recount process. \u201cThe governor\u2019s use of his bully pulpit is provoking appeals that he recuse himself from the vote counting \u2014 not only from [Sen. Bill] Nelson, but also the Florida League of Women Voters,\u201d The Post reports. \u201cThe organization, which alleged that Scott \u2018intentionally politicized governance of the election,\u2019 filed a lawsuit Monday demanding that he remove himself from the recount process.\u201d\n\nSuppress voting among traditional Democratic groups; supervise your own election; and then cry foul to intimidate voting officials and to discredit the opposition\u2019s wins \u2014 this sounds like something out of a tin-pot dictatorship, not what you\u2019d expect from the world\u2019s leading democracy. Ominously, this practice suggests that Trump and his cult-followers might refuse to accept the results of the 2020 election if things don\u2019t go their way. The result could be a high-stakes constitutional standoff.\n\nHarvard professor Steven Levitsky, who co-authored the book \u201cHow Democracies Die,\u201d explained in an NPR interview in January that \u201cwhat Donald Trump has done by over and over again saying that \u2014 lying, saying that our elections are fraudulent, that the election was fraudulent, that 11 million illegal immigrants voted, that the election was not truly fair, free and fair is to convince a very large number of voters, a very large number of Republicans that our elections actually are fraudulent \u2014 and the same thing with the media.\u201d Levitsky continued: \u201cHe has convinced a fairly large segment of our society that the mainstream media \u2014 that the establishment media is conspiring to bring his government down, is purposefully lying and making stuff up such that a fairly large number of Americans no longer believe anything but Fox News. In the long term, it\u2019s hard to imagine how that\u2019s healthy for a democracy.\u201d\n\nHow can this noxious practice of discrediting elections be checked? State governments must invest in upgrading voting equipment and making sure competent officials are in place well in advance of an election. The news (as it has done in the case of Florida) should make crystal clear when there is no basis for accusations of fraud \u2014 and then pester members of the party making that claim to go show evidence or to repudiate the charges. In addition, state laws should make clear that officials cannot run their own elections, since this is akin to picking the judge for your own trial. (Query whether Trump has done this with regard to Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh\u2019s appointment.)\n\nDefenders of free and fair elections should continue filing lawsuits to prevent these conflicts of interest, and judges should grant prompt relief to plaintiffs demanding that the Rick Scotts and the Brian Kemps abstain from ruling on their own election recounts.\n\nHouse Democrats also can conduct oversight hearings on voting access and reform; they should haul in elected officials who have made baseless allegations of election trickery, demand they produce proof and in the absence of evidence urge them to retract their specious claims. (Maybe political hacks will think twice about fanning rumors if they know they will be held to account for their comments.)\n\nFinally, we need updating of the Voting Rights Act, in part to reactivate pre-clearance provisions in states with a history of voting rights violations. (Anyone think Kemp would have gotten away with his voter suppression tactics if all changes had to be preapproved?) Federal voting law should be emphatic: Officials should not be permitted to supervise federal elections in their own races.\n\nUltimately, the best check on anti-democratic conduct comes from voters, as we saw a week ago when Democrats won up and down the ballot, coast to coast. If officials are politically punished for crying wolf about election misconduct, they will do it less frequently.\n\nVoters should hold politicians to a simple standard: Attempting to undermine the sanctity of elections by baseless rumor-mongering should disqualify a politician from holding office. Forever.\n\nRead more:\n\nWhat Democrats\u2019 big win in Arizona means\n\nHow to lose in 2020 if you are a Republican\n\nThree options for conscientious Republicans (or ex-Republicans)", "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump has soured on his Homeland Security secretary and Kirstjen Nielsen is expected to leave her job, perhaps as soon as this week.\n\nThat\u2019s according to two people who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss personnel matters publicly.

(Win McNamee/Getty Images) (Win Mcnamee/Getty Images)\n\nSome of the biggest names in broadcast television have reached a settlement with government regulators after the Justice Department filed a lawsuit alleging that the companies shared private information with one another in ways that allowed them to subtly manipulate TV ad prices.\n\nThe settlement covers six companies: Sinclair Broadcast Group, Raycom Media, Tribune Media, Meredith Corp., Griffin Communications and Dreamcatcher Broadcasting. It forbids them to share nonpublic information about ad sales for seven years.\n\n\u201cThe unlawful exchange of competitively sensitive information allowed these television broadcast companies to disrupt the normal competitive process of spot advertising in markets across the United States,\u201d Makan Delrahim, the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust chief, said in a statement.\n\nBy sharing advertising sales data, the companies gained insight into each other\u2019s operations that they would not have had otherwise, according to the Justice Department\u2019s lawsuit. The added information gave them the ability to develop specialized pricing strategies and exercise greater leverage over advertisers when negotiating with them for deals.\n\nThe settlement follows a class-action suit filed by advertisers in August claiming that the media companies had conspired to fix the price of TV advertising.\n\nIt reflects the Justice Department\u2019s heightened scrutiny of the increasingly concentrated media industry. In recent months, the agency has continued to fight its initially unsuccessful lawsuit to block AT&T\u2019s merger with Time Warner (now renamed WarnerMedia) and warned Comcast that it will continue to monitor the company\u2019s behavior now that a number of regulatory conditions imposed on its 2011 acquisition of NBCUniversal have expired.\n\nThree of the companies did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Meredith said it disagreed with the allegations but thought it was in the company\u2019s interest to enter into the settlement.\n\n\u201cImportantly, the settlement does not require Meredith to pay any penalty, includes no admission that any law has been violated, and will not require us to change our current business practices,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\nTribune called the issue a \u201cdistraction\u201d and said it was glad to move beyond the matter \u201cin a way that has no operational effect.\u201d\n\nEchoing the two other companies' comments, Raycom Media added that despite the Justice Department suit, \u201cwe have seen no evidence that the alleged information sharing had any actual competitive impact in any advertising market.\u201d", "The confused person on the radio was not someone typically associated with dodgy reports of extraterrestrial interaction. There were no claims that large-eyed green men crossed the cosmos to turn livestock inside out or too-detailed, breathless tales about cold metal tables and undignified alien probes.\n\nThe flummoxed person on the radio was simply an airline pilot who could not explain what she saw in the sky over Ireland.\n\nThe British Airways pilot was operating Flight BA94 from Montreal on Friday when she contacted the nearest air traffic control tower to inquire whether there were any military exercises over the Atlantic Ocean to which she hadn\u2019t been alerted, according to the Irish Examiner.\n\nWhen controllers told her that the skies were clear, she politely set them straight. She said she and her crew saw bright lights streaking through the air at phenomenal speeds \u2014 twice the speed of sound.\n\n\u201cIt came up on our left-hand side (rapidly veered) to the north, we saw a bright light and it just disappeared at a very high speed . . . we were just wondering,\u201d the pilot said, according to the newspaper and audio of the interaction posted on the Internet. \u201cWe didn\u2019t think it was a likely collision course . . . (just wondering) what it could be.\u201d\n\nAlso wondering were pilots flying nearby, who saw the same, well, whatever it was.\n\nA Virgin Airlines pilot of Flight VS76 from Orlando to Manchester said it was not something but somethings: \u201cmultiple objects following the same sort of trajectory \u2014 very bright from where we were.\u201d\n\nThe Irish Aviation Authority said the reports will be \u201cinvestigated under the normal confidential occurrence investigation process.\u201d\n\nBut for many people who read between the classified lines, there was no need. We already know the Truth.\n\nThis is normally the point at which chortling naysayers would shout their disbelief. After all, for decades the public has been told that aliens don\u2019t actually exist and that people who believed otherwise were crackpots in tinfoil hats.\n\n[Sorry, this strange space rock was not sent by aliens to save us]\n\nBut in an admission straight out of a B movie, the Pentagon recently confirmed that there was a $22 million government program to collect and analyze \u201canomalous aerospace threats\u201d \u2014 government speak for UFOs.\n\nAnd Area 51, the secret base in Nevada whose existence had been denied by the government for decades \u2014 has existed for decades, the government admitted. It was a test strip for a CIA spy plane and other classified aircraft, according to a CIA history declassified in 2013. And because the government had a giant secret test base in the Nevada desert, it used the area for all kinds of secret testing: putting the A-12 aircraft and the angular F-117 stealth ground attack jet through their paces.\n\nSo who needs a tinfoil hat now? The admission lent a patina of viability to a century of bizarre, unexplained phenomena.\n\nBut what of the bright lights over the Atlantic seen by not one but two airline crews responsible for the health and well-being of hundreds of passengers?\n\nAircraft experts told the Irish Examiner that the lights were probably meteorites entering Earth at a low angle.

Ebenhack/AP)\n\nThe Redskins improved to 6-3 for the first time since 2008 on Sunday, but in true Redskins fashion, much of the conversation about the surprising NFC East leaders the following day concerned Josh Norman\u2019s postgame criticism of Washington\u2019s fans.\n\nIn case you somehow missed Norman\u2019s comments, he said he feels like the Redskins play better on the road, where they\u2019re supported by their \u201ctrue fans.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe go into the homestands, and it\u2019s like an open bubble,\u201d Norman said. \u201cLike the other team\u2019s turf or something. You hear more of them than you do us. Then if something bad happens, they suck. They sit back in their seat, and they boo. I don\u2019t know. This year, I\u2019m starting to see that.\u201d\n\nWell then. As The Team 980\u2032s Steve Czaban put it, Norman \u201cgrabbed an electrified wire when it comes to fan-player relations.\"\n\n\u201cWe get accused \u2014 fans, broadcasters, media members \u2014 of not understanding what it\u2019s like to be an athlete,\u201d Czaban said on his podcast. \u201cAnd that is true. We really do not understand. We don\u2019t understand what it takes to play in the NFL, yet we opine upon, we pontificate upon and we run our mouths all the time about players in the NFL, and often times athletes will say, \u2018You have no idea.\u2019 This is a case where I\u2019m going to turn it around on Josh and say, \u2018Josh, you have no f------ idea. You have never sat in two-and-a-half hours of traffic getting into the parking lot at Raljon to go to a game. You have not been served ice cold french fries at $12 a tub. You have not endured the humiliations of years and years of inept Redskins football. You\u2019ve been here for a hot minute in the grand scheme of things. You have no idea how beaten down the fan base is here. Yeah, you\u2019re having a nice season. You\u2019re 6-3. How was last year? How was your year last year, by the way? If I recall, you didn\u2019t have any interceptions. Just saying. How much money did you make last year doing this? Because here\u2019s the thing, Josh. Everyone else that comes to the games, they have to pay money. This is a net-negative to their family\u2019s financial spreadsheets, and yet they still come.\"\n\nCzaban echoed a lot of what Post columnist Tom Boswell wrote in his weekly chat on Monday about the years of frustration that Redskins fans have experienced since Daniel Snyder bought the team. He also questioned the timing of Norman\u2019s criticism.\n\n\u201cThis was, Josh, a Great win, capital 'G' for the Washington Redskins, and now you\u2019ve said this,\u201d Czaban continued. \u201cAnd now you\u2019ve thrown this turd in the punch bowl to try to assess who are the \u2018true\u2019 fans and who are the \u2018fake\u2019 fans, and why the home crowd is not more vocal.

You get booed when you\u2019re at home and you\u2019re playing like garbage, and when you do something well, they cheer you.\"\n\n[Tom Boswell: Josh Norman doesn't know the Redskins' history]\n\nOthers, including ESPN\u2019s Scott Van Pelt and former Redskins running back Clinton Portis, said they could understand where Norman was coming from.\n\n\u201cHe was talking about how they don\u2019t get support at home, which, having grown up there is an amazing thing to hear,\u201d Van Pelt said on Sunday night\u2019s \u201cSportsCenter,\u201d via Chris Lingebach. \u201cBut he\u2019s right. The days of RFK and the legendary D.C. home field are long gone. There are a lot of reasons for it. Mostly, decades of poor performance. But the arrogance of this franchise, to just assume the loyalty of the fan base was forever, has come home to roost. Now the bandwagon\u2019s still a powerful thing and it can fill up, but so too is the atrophy that this fan base has undergone. So I can understand and appreciate his frustration, because it\u2019s real.\u201d\n\nPortis compared fandom to a relationship. He suggested that if you choose to be with someone, there\u2019s no point in dwelling on the past, even if that past is littered with misery.\n\n\u201cEither move on, or stick with me,\u201d Portis told Grant Paulsen and Danny Rouhier on 106.7 The Fan. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to move on and go find a new team, then go find a new team. But if you\u2019re going to be a Redskins fan, I need you to come out and support. That\u2019s basically what it is. It\u2019s like a relationship. You don\u2019t want it to linger. I don\u2019t want to keep going back and forth with you over something I did in the beginning of the relationship. If you\u2019re going to be with me, be with me . . . You wanted me to change, I\u2019ve changed. We\u2019re 6-3. We\u2019re putting a product on the field that you can root on. We\u2019re not 3-6. We\u2019re in first place, we\u2019re not in last place, so if you\u2019re gonna ride with me, I don\u2019t want to hear this negativity every day . . . Right now, we\u2019re in first place, we\u2019re fighting to win the division. So come ride with me, come roll with me, come support me, be on my side. Don\u2019t keep saying, \u2018Well, you did this. You did that.' [Otherwise], leave me. Stop cheering for me. Don\u2019t be here. Let me go get someone else, or you go get someone else. There\u2019s other teams. There\u2019s 31 other teams you can root for.\u201d\n\n[The Redskins move up to No. 9 in The Post's NFL power rankings]\n\nPortis also discussed the Redskins' playoff prospects.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen the Ravens win a Super Bowl with this formula,\u201d Portis said. \u201cYou can win with this. You\u2019re winning with this. Think of some of these high [scoring], explosive scoring teams, and they\u2019re losing. You look at the Rams and all of a sudden you\u2019re questioning the Rams' defense. The Rams score a lot of points, but their defense is giving up a lot of points. Defense travels, and running game travels. All of this high-power act, all of this throwing the ball around, in December that changes anyway. Once the snow hits the ground and the ground is froze and this ball really becomes hard, you\u2019re going to have to find a running game. Right now, I think the Skins are already playing December football.\"\n\nThe 2000 Ravens held 12 teams below 300 total yards during the regular season. These Redskins haven\u2019t done that since Week 2 and just allowed 501 yards to the Bucs, but their playoff chances are up to 66 percent, according to 538. Washington is also the favorite to win the division, thanks to the Eagles' loss to the Cowboys on \u201cSunday Night Football.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is now, I think, fair to say, after more than half the games this season, that the Eagles' Super Bowl hangover is not going away,\u201d Tony Kornheiser said on Monday\u2019s episode of his podcast. \u201cThe Cowboys are bad. The Cowboys are 4-5. The Eagles are 4-5. The Giants are horrific. The Giants are [2-7]. And the Redskins \u2014 and nobody sitting here at the table thinks that\u2019s a good team \u2014 and they\u2019re 6-3. They\u2019re going to win the division.\u201d\n\nNot everyone is convinced of that just yet.\n\n\u201cAt some point i n time, you can\u2019t keep winning with backup offensive lineman that\u2019s littered the offensive line,\u201d FS1\u2032s Shannon Sharpe said on \u201cUndisputed.\u201d \u201cWashington\u2019s defense, they gave up 500 yards . . . I like to think that Philly maybe doesn\u2019t have the receiving corps, they\u2019re maybe not quite as explosive as Tampa, but they can do some things against Washington. With that being said, I\u2019m going to say [the Eagles] are going to win this division at 9-7.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t championship pedigree stand for something? Don\u2019t you gotta put your trust in championship pedigree? That\u2019s why I\u2019m picking the Philadelphia Eagles,\u201d LaDainian Tomlinson said on NFL Network\u2019s \u201cNFL Total Access.\u201d \u201cLast year, they were 5-1 in that division. Right now they\u2019re 1-1. They know how to win in the division, and guess what? It\u2019s still ahead of them. . . . They can win this division with no problem. I think they get it together.\u201d\n\nTomlinson\u2019s NFL Network colleague, former Packers wide receiver James Jones, has apparently taken the keys to the Redskins' bandwagon away from Deion Sanders. Not only does Jones think Washington will win the NFC East, he predicts the Redskins will finish 11-5.

Saudi-led airstrikes targeting Yemen\u2019s Shiite rebels resumed early on Monday in the southern port city of Aden after a five-day truce expired amid talks on the war-torn country\u2019s future that were boycotted by the rebels. (Hani Mohammed/AP)\n\nPhilip H. Gordon is the Mary and David Boies Senior Fellow in U.S. Foreign Policy at the Council on Foreign Relations. He served as White House Coordinator for the Middle East under President Barack Obama.\n\nThe murder of Saudi columnist Jamal Khashoggi, along with sharply deteriorating humanitarian conditions and growing media attention paid to the war in Yemen, has led to increased pressure on Saudi Arabia to end the war there.\n\nTop U.S. officials are now calling on Riyadh to agree to a ceasefire and participate in U.N.-sponsored talks, and the Pentagon announced last Friday it would no longer provide in-air refueling for Saudi bombing runs. Meanwhile, Congress, led by the new Democratic majority in the House, is credibly threatening to suspend arms sales to Saudi Arabia, which countries such as Germany have already done. The growing pressure, a marked departure from the almost-unconditional support the Trump administration has been providing to the Saudis, has led to renewed hopes that the war might finally be brought to a negotiated end.\n\nWe should all hope that U.N. talks, led by the able British mediator Martin Griffiths, succeed \u2014 but we should also be realistic. Even if the Saudis and their Emirati partners show up ready for compromise, the Iran-backed Houthis, who control much of Yemen today, are sadly unlikely to reciprocate. Having survived years of economic isolation and relentless Saudi bombing, the Houthis know all the pressure is now on the other side. Their Iranian backers, in turn, likely assume they have nothing to gain from compromise either given the Trump administration\u2019s hostility to the Tehran regime. Houthi rejectionism would give the Saudis and Emiratis a pretext to resume the war, possibly including a bloody assault on the port of Hodeidah, which U.N. officials assess could considerably worsen the humanitarian situation even while failing to force the Houthis to give in.\n\nThe Saudis claim they will have no choice but to escalate the war if they cannot reach an agreement at the talks, but here\u2019s a better alternative: Declare victory and go home. Given all they have invested after three and a half years of war, and their legitimate concerns about Iranian influence and Houthi threats, that might seem irrational, and it would certainly be a bitter pill to swallow. But it would be far better than continuing with a war that has had incalculable humanitarian, financial, strategic and reputational costs for the Saudis but has not remotely advanced their own declared objectives.\n\nIn fact, on almost every measure, Saudi Arabia\u2019s war in Yemen has failed. Three and a half years after the launch of what was meant to be a quick military operation, the Houthis are stronger than ever; Iran\u2019s influence has only grown; al-Qaeda terrorists remain a major threat; Yemenis are suffering in what may be the worst humanitarian situation on the planet; refugees have poured into Saudi Arabia and neighboring Oman; and Saudi Arabia\u2019s reputation \u2014 critical to its ambitions to become a modern, industrial economy and tourist destination \u2014 is suffering badly in the United States and around the world. If the Saudis applied the \u201cbenchmarking\u201d approach associated with their economic reform plan \u2014 reassessing policies regularly and changing them if objectives are not being achieved \u2014 they would have certainly altered their policies in Yemen several years ago.\n\nBearing these high costs would be more justifiable if there were any realistic hope that staying the course would achieve their goal of restoring the pre-Houthi regime to power, but that is unlikely even in the long run. On periodic visits to Riyadh over the past three and a half years, Saudi officials have regularly acknowledged to me in private that the war was not going well, but equally consistently insisted that progress was just around the corner. The optimistic official assurances were eerily reminiscent of those regularly issued by American political and military leaders for years in Vietnam, or by Soviet leaders in Afghanistan, before they finally and belatedly accepted the reality that their military interventions were counterproductive.\n\nFor the Saudis, \u201cgoing home\u201d in Yemen would not mean abandoning the legitimate objectives of limiting Iranian influence or containing threats from Houthis. On the contrary, even if they end the current bombing campaign, there are a number of steps the Saudis could take to defend their national interests and increase their security. These could include enhanced maritime patrols, with U.S. support, to better prevent Iranian arms deliveries to the Houthis; increased diplomatic and economic pressure on Oman \u2014 bolstered by major financial incentives \u2014 to reinforce its land border with Yemen; a readiness to undertake airstrikes against advanced ballistic missile sites and air bases in Yemen that are used to attack Saudi Arabia, much like Israel currently does in Syria; the deployment of enhanced missile defenses around Riyadh and other Saudi cities, to include U.S.-made Theater High Altitude Area Defense Systems; financial and humanitarian assistance to Saudi allies in Yemen; and even economic and monetary incentives to Houthis, including funds for reconstruction, if they end their attacks on Saudi interests. All of these measures put together would cost far less than Riyadh is currently spending on the war, and they would likely save many lives and bring greater security as well.\n\nThe United States should continue to urge the Saudis to come to peace talks and pursue a negotiated settlement. It should also insist, however, that the Houthis and Iran not be given a veto over peace. Saudi Arabia should be pressed to end the current war with others if it can, but alone if it must.\n\nRead more:\n\nPhilip H.

(Screen grab via Facebook)\n\nAt first, 14-year-old Brett Corbett told his mom he was sent to the principal\u2019s office sopping wet because the kids dared him to swim in the creek behind the school, in Glace Bay, Nova Scotia.\n\nBut then the videos emerged and with them, an appalling story of bullying.\n\nIn one video displayed with this article, Corbett, a high school freshman with cerebral palsy, is seen standing in the middle of shallow, murky water while more than a dozen kids stare down at him from the top of a small hill. He lies down on his stomach, keeping his palms flat in the mud to steady himself as the current rushes past him.\n\nThen, a moment later, a girl leaps from the bank, steps on Corbett\u2019s back as if it were a springboard, and launches herself to the other side \u2014 turning Corbett into a human bridge.\n\nIn another video, the teenagers are laughing hysterically. They yell at Corbett to get back in the water after he stands up. He doesn\u2019t want to.\n\n\u201cDo it, you f------ b----!\u201d one classmate screams, and Corbett did.\n\nCorbett\u2019s mother, Terri McEachern, said three students walked on her son.\n\nShe has not slept well since this happened to him last Wednesday. One of the videos has spread across Canada and much of the world, evoking shock and calls to stand up more strongly against bullying. A local boxer organized a \u201cStand for Brett Corbett\u201d rally outside Glace Bay High School to \u201cshow Brett he is never alone.\u201d Numerous messages of support have poured in for the 14-year-old.\n\nBut what has amazed McEachern most, she told The Washington Post, is her son\u2019s forgiveness. He didn\u2019t tell her the truth about what happened to him at first because he said he didn\u2019t want the other kids to get in trouble, she said. When she asked him whether he had been walked on after she watched the videos, he told her, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, I was already wet.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just breaking my heart. ... This is his mind-set,\u201d she said. \u201cChildren with disabilities have the most amazing gifts in the world. They don\u2019t see bad in anyone. They see so much good in everybody.\"\n\nMcEachern didn\u2019t find out what really happened to Corbett until a family friend saw one of the videos circulating on Snapchat and Instagram. He took his own video of the video and shared it with McEachern\u2019s older son \u2014 and on Facebook.\n\n\u201cNever in my LIFE have I ever been more disgusted,\u201d the friend, Brandon Jolie, wrote. \u201cEveryone who knows this boy knows he has a disability. How fricken hard is it to show some compassion??\"\n\nThe responses to Jolie\u2019s post poured in: \u201cHow insulting for this young man. A total lack of respect for those with a disability,\u201d one said.\n\n\u201cThey should be ashamed of themselves,\u201d said another.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the most disgusting things I have ever seen,\u201d another woman said.\n\nNever in my LIFE have I ever been more disgusted. The young boy in this video is my friends son, he has cerebral palsy. This is Glace Bay High School. Parents; you failed this generation. The amount of teenagers that stood around and watched this happen, even took videos of it. I hope you watch this video, recognize your kid and feel the shame. To the little girl that stepped on him; you should be absolutely ashamed of yourself. Everyone who knows this boy knows he has a disability. How fricken hard is it to show some compassion?? To stand by and not only allow it to happen but to take a video as if it's a joke! It's 2018, show some respect for eachother and empower eachother rather than claw other people down to build yourself up. I think we need to take this situation and make change out of it. We need to look at our children and the lessons we are teaching, we need to play a more active role in their social life. Stuff like this happens because we don't know what our kids are doing at school or with their friends. This needs to CHANGE. Posted by Brandon Jolie on Thursday, November 8, 2018\n\nMcEachern said some of the students involved were suspended for a single day \u2014 a response she has found terribly inadequate.\n\nShe wasn\u2019t the only one. About 20 students walked out of classes on Friday to protest what they described as the school\u2019s failure to take a firmer stand, the Cape Breton Post reported.\n\n\u201cHonestly, it\u2019s sickening,\u201d a 17-year-old junior told the paper. \u201cIt\u2019s a little upsetting to see nothing done about it.\u201d\n\nSchool administrators could not immediately be reached for comment by The Post, but a spokeswoman for the Cape Breton-Victoria Regional Centre for Education told the Cape Breton Post that the administration was taking the incident seriously and that it found the behavior \u201cunacceptable and very disappointing.\u201d The spokeswoman, Michelle MacLeod, also said police were investigating the incident, but she would not confirm or deny whether the students had been suspended, citing privacy reasons.\n\nSince the video went viral, some of the students seen on the videos at the creek have apologized. The father of one of them apologized on his son\u2019s behalf at a public meeting while reading from a letter in which the boy described his actions as \u201cthe worst decision of my life,\u201d CTV News reported.\n\nTwo other girls came with their parents to Corbett\u2019s house to tell him and his mother they were sorry. They each read aloud from their letters. The parents all cried. The girls cried. So did Corbett.\n\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have told you to go [into the water]. I should have helped you up instead of breaking you down,\u201d one of the girls began.\n\n\u201cYou are way stronger than me for being so forgiving so fast,\u201d she continued, \u201cand I\u2019m really sorry for what I have done. I know better. This is not who I am as a person. I truly care. I made a really bad choice and I will live with that for the rest of my life. I want with all my heart to make this better, and I can promise I will never let this happen to anyone again.\u201d\n\nReading from her letter, the girl said she thought Corbett was an \u201cawesome\u201d and \u201cinteresting\u201d person, but perhaps many of the kids at school didn\u2019t know that about him. She wanted to get to know him, she said, and she asked him, \u201cif you\u2019re up for it,\u201d whether they could be friends.\n\nCorbett said they could, and before long they were headed upstairs to play Xbox, McEachern said.\n\n\u201cThey said, \u2018I shouldn\u2019t have done this to you,\u2019 but he said, \u2018No, I\u2019m glad,\u2019\" McEachern remembered. \u201cHe said he was glad it happened to him, because maybe his story can make a difference.\u201d\n\nJolie said he has received comments from all over the world.\n\nPeople had their own stories to tell of friends or relatives who had been bullied. Mary Lou Levisky, 76, remembered her brother, who had cerebral palsy, and her \u201crecollections of children laughing in the street at him, constant comments from adults of what is wrong and parents who would not allow their daughters to come over and play at my house as they were afraid of my brother.\n\n\u201cI was horrified to learn via this incident that this behaviour still exists today. Congratulations to Brett and his many supporters for not taking it anymore. Seared in my brain are several incidents: my brother coming home from school with a sign in chalk on the back of his jacket, \u2018I am an idiot, punch me\u2019 placed there by male classmates.'\u201d\n\nMore from Morning Mix:\n\nAn American traveler vanished in Mexico. Now, his family\u2019s search is underway.\n\nRejected cactuses, street graffiti, and thousands of sandwiches: The outlandish tactics that cities used to try to lure Amazon", "Amazon.com has finally made its decision: The company is building two new headquarters in Crystal City in Northern Virginia and Long Island City in Queens. The massive expansion comes with investments of more than $5 billion, 50,000 jobs, and an influx of highly paid workers and their families into the chosen communities. But winning the grand prize also comes with hefty baggage.\n\nBelow are some winners and losers.\n\nWinners\n\nAmazon\n\nThe Amazon sweepstakes generated more than a year of free publicity for the company. City officials pleaded with the company as they bid to make their cities seem more attractive than their competitors'. Some offered gifts, posted videos of themselves unboxing Amazon Prime packages and even teased that they would change their names. They also proposed a plethora of tax incentives and subsidies to a company run by the richest man in the world. (Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.) Maryland\u2019s offer, which was among the few that was made public, amounted to $8.5 billion in tax credits and incentives.\n\nOn top of being offered such perks, Amazon now has a unique and valuable set of data: an intimate look inside infrastructure plans and labor markets of dozens of cities. As the company continues to grow, it can use this information to try to grab more concessions from state and local governments and gain an edge over its own competitors, analysts say.\n\nWith new home bases in the Washington area and New York, Amazon will soon have a huge presence in two talent-rich cities, giving the company a larger pool of workers from which to draw and attractive locations to offer prospective employees.\n\nBut the company\u2019s public competition has drawn scrutiny. Critics such as urban studies author and academic Richard Florida have called Amazon\u2019s search for a second headquarters a \u201csham\u201d that duped cities into giving up huge taxpayer-funded benefits. Others have criticized the company\u2019s decision to split its new headquarters, changing the rules in the middle of the selection process.\n\nProperty owners and developers\n\nLandlords and residents looking to sell their homes are seeing green in Amazon\u2019s arrival. The company says that many of its jobs will offer salaries above $100,000, with thousands of highly paid managers and computer engineers looking for a place to settle their families. The surge in housing demand is expected to lead to higher prices. And with an influx of workers who have more money to spend on housing, developers will have greater incentive to build and sell bigger homes and luxury apartment buildings.\n\n[Property owners are delighted Amazon will be moving in. Renters, first-time buyers? Not so much.]\n\nAmazon, based in Seattle, estimates that from 2010 to 2016, $38 billion of indirect investments have flowed to the local economy. That could be a sign of things to come for development in the two new locations.\n\nHighly skilled workers\n\nExecutives, managers, engineers, lawyers, accountants and administrative professionals based on the East Coast or hoping to move there have yet another major company eager for their talents. The best tech-industry workers near the two new Amazon locations will also see their salaries swell. Employers will have to shell out more cash to retain their top-performing staff members or risk losing them to Amazon. Also, the company\u2019s grand arrival will probably force other big-name companies to expand their footprints in those metropolitan areas to stay competitive in hiring and recruitment, analysts say, offering tech workers even more opportunities.\n\nLosers\n\nRenters and low-income residents\n\nAs the fortunes of homeowners may rise, first-time home buyers, renters and low-income residents could stand to lose. Amazon\u2019s expansion is expected to trigger escalating housing costs, analysts say, potentially pricing out residents who don\u2019t bring in big paychecks. Rather than erect an apartment building with 50 units, a developer might build 25 larger units with opulent furnishings to cater to the bigger budgets of high-earners. The New York and D.C. metro areas already suffer from housing-affordability issues, which may worsen with the arrival of a steady stream of workers and if home prices take off.\n\nCritics point to Seattle as a harbinger of a worsening housing market and a crisis of homelessness. Residents with lower incomes may see more financial pressure just to maintain their quality of life, experts say.\n\nAn analysis by rental-search site HotPads, however, found that rents in the D.C. area would increase by only 0.6 percent with Amazon\u2019s move, Washington Post writers Tracy Jan and Kathy Orton reported.\n\nCertain local business owners\n\nRestaurants, cafes and bars may get more foot traffic from the new workers and residents. But business owners who lease their spaces will also probably face a price hike as demand for real estate in the area increases, experts say. Business tenants who lease office space and don\u2019t offer services or dining will also be hard-pressed to find a benefit from having Amazon settle in. Local shops may see rising costs as their rents increase and, like retailers across the country, will continue to face stiff competition from online-shopping powerhouses like Amazon.\n\nCommuters\n\nTraffic can always get worse. And it usually does.\n\nThe D.C. region\u2019s traffic congestion is among the worst in the country. Along the Interstate 395 corridor, where Amazon would be located, traffic is especially extreme. On Friday, for instance, travelers described total gridlock and chaos as they tried to make their way to Reagan National Airport when Metro service was suspended. Some passengers, desperate to catch their flights, ran to the airport from Crystal City, the neighborhood Amazon will soon call home. (Amazon\u2019s Crystal City HQ is within a half-mile \u2014 or a panicked walking distance!)\n\nNew York traffic is inescapable, too. As a sign of how bad things are, and how much worse they are getting, the city has the nation\u2019s most extensive congestion-alert system warning drivers to stay off the roads. The number of alert days will rise to 16 this year, up from 10 last year, according to the New York Times, owing in part to construction, a rise in delivery and ride-hailing vehicles, and security-related street closures. A campaign to set up a congestion-pricing plan that would charge drivers in Manhattan for using the most clogged lanes failed to pass this year.\n\nTransit systems in New York and Washington can be nightmarish in their own ways. The D.C. Metrorail system has faced a raft of safety and reliability problems over several years, which has led to falling ridership. But service delays continue to prompt overcrowding. And in New York, a year after the governor declared that the subway is in a state of emergency, service remains dismal.\n\nRival tech companies\n\nHolding on to the best employees just got harder for Amazon\u2019s competitors in New York, Washington and everywhere else.\n\nBusinesses that depend on skilled engineers, product managers, and legal and accounting staff will expect to see their labor costs go up, as they try to stop Amazon from poaching their best. To keep staff from jumping ship, tech companies will be compelled to pay their people higher salaries and boost their perks.\n\nTech companies without a large Washington or New York presence will also lose an edge in recruiting computer science graduates. Aside from being a world-class technology company, Amazon will now boast a headquarters in two thriving East Coast cities, a huge draw for the next generation of educated young people who don\u2019t see themselves moving to Seattle or Silicon Valley.\n\nU.S. cities\n\nAmazon\u2019s selection of the D.C. and New York regions is the latest example of prosperous, talent-rich, highly educated coastal cities winning corporate deals to the detriment of mid-tier and smaller cities. More than 200 locations submitted proposals to Amazon and have now lost out on tens of thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in investments.\n\nIn addition, these losing cities may be in a weaker position to secure future corporate headquarters because Washington and New York have gained even more job opportunities, skilled workers and private-sector dollars. Superstar cities with universities, a skilled workforce and cultural cache keep winning business deals, experts say, reinforcing their economic advantages. This dynamic may create a kind of momentum that\u2019s difficult for less affluent cities to overcome.\n\nIf investments by large employers continue to flow unevenly across the country, the lopsided pull of wealthy, densely developed, high-paying cities could exacerbate income inequality and entrench an economic system dominated by a handful of prosperous tech hubs, analysts say.\n\nIt depends\n\nLocal government\n\nTelling voters that you brought home the big one may seem like a flashy political win for the mayor. But not all constituents may see it that way. To win over Amazon, city officials had to offer attractive incentives, which may have included massive tax breaks and promises to build out public infrastructure. What elected officials might view as a huge jobs victory, taxpayers might see as a fleecing. The benefits that Amazon has promised to the areas might also flow to a narrow subset of people who are already living the dream while the costs will burden everyone. While the immediate upside of landing a prestigious development deal may seem clear, what remains harder to foretell is the long-term consequences of a tech giant becoming a neighbor.", "\n\nJourdan Loyola, 7, was sickened by acute flaccid myelitis two years ago and is still undergoing rehabilitation for his partially paralyzed arm. (Annie Flanagan for The Washington Post)\n\nBy the time Jourdan Loyola was finally diagnosed with a rare and baffling condition called acute flaccid myelitis two years ago, the 5-year-old could not move his neck, his right arm or either leg. Unsure how to treat the unusual condition, which began with coldlike symptoms and progressed within days to paralysis, doctors in New Orleans scrambled to consult colleagues across the country before giving him steroids and a massive dose of disease-fighting antibodies.\n\nHis legs recovered, but his arm and neck remained weak. A nine-hour surgery to transfer nerves from his ribs to replace crucial nerves that power his arm muscles strengthened the limb. But now, at 7, he still can\u2019t tie his shoes or wash his hair, or write with his right hand.\n\nHis daily routine includes intensive physical therapy and electrical stimulation of his muscles that often causes skin rashes. Doctors told his parents that they don\u2019t know whether he will ever get back full use of his right arm.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have a time frame,\u201d said Chelsi Loyola, his mother, who wonders whether earlier diagnosis and treatment might have helped. \u201cTo me, that\u2019s so hard to hear. I just want him to recover.\u2019\u2019\n\nAs AFM cases have surged this fall \u2014 the third spike since 2014 \u2014 federal health officials and clinicians across the United States have raced to understand the disease. On Tuesday, officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced a new task force to study the condition and come up with fresh leads on what causes it and how to treat it.\n\nIn the meantime, parents of sick children are growing increasingly frustrated. Competing theories have emerged about what triggers AFM; without clear guidance, doctors are trying several different kinds of treatment. While some children have seen improvement, no treatment has been found to lead reliably to full recovery. Many will need intensive physical therapy for years. Some need a ventilator to help them breathe.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that often we\u2019re faced with something we\u2019re still learning about,\u201d said Michelle Melicosta, a pediatrician at the Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore, which specializes in disorders of the brain, spinal cord and musculoskeletal system. \u201cWe just don\u2019t always have the answer we wish we had. It makes it a little scarier for the family.\u201d\n\nAFM is caused by inflammation of the spinal cord that results in severe muscle weakness and paralysis. More than 400 confirmed cases, most of them in children, have been reported in the past four years, and one child with AFM died last year. Clinicians say the condition is underdiagnosed and underreported.\n\n\n\nJourdan stretches his arms with his mother, Chelsi, as part of his daily physical therapy. (Annie Flanagan for The Washington Post)\n\nThough AFM has been reported occasionally for years, the CDC began noticing spikes in 2014. Cases have since surged every other year in the fall. In 2014, the CDC confirmed 120 cases. In 2016, there were 149.\n\nThis year, at least 90 cases have been confirmed in 27 states, with 162 more under investigation. A few weeks ago, the CDC began reporting the larger number of suspected cases alongside confirmed ones to alert parents and physicians to the latest spike.\n\nThe CDC announced Tuesday that it will track the long-term outcomes of all AFM cases from this year and previous years.\n\nSeveral experts say there is a strong correlation between AFM and outbreaks of a common respiratory virus called enterovirus D68. Some enteroviruses are known to attack the spinal cord.\n\nThe CDC, however, is also focusing on a different possibility \u2014 that AFM is caused not by a viral infection but by the patients\u2019 own immune systems.\n\n\u201cIt seems to be more of an autoimmune syndrome, as opposed to a direct result of a virus,\u201d Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC\u2019s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said in an interview. She compared the condition to what happens in Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, a rare disorder in which the immune system attacks nerve cells, often after an illness such as a respiratory infection.\n\nMost AFM cases begin in a similar fashion, with fever and coldlike symptoms, such as a cough and lethargy. Sudden weakness or paralysis can follow within hours or days.\n\n\u201cLots of kids get respiratory illness and fever, but only a small proportion go on to develop AFM,\u201d Messonnier said. \u201cWhat we don\u2019t know about is this black box in between. . . . We\u2019re trying to open up that black box.\u201d\n\n\n\nJourdan operates a specialized bicycle with his arms as part of his rehabilitation. (Annie Flanagan for The Washington Post)\n\n\n\nJourdan prepares for physical therapy. (Annie Flanagan for The Washington Post)\n\nJourdan nicknamed his right arm \u201cGimpy.\u201d (Annie Flanagan for The Washington Post)\n\nLast week, the CDC held a teleconference with a group of experts who treat AFM and on Wednesday released updated treatment guidance for doctors. Separately, about 50 specialists who have diagnosed and cared for patients across the country have taken the unusual step of establishing an informal AFM working group.\n\nBut without a clear understanding of whether AFM is triggered by a virus or is an autoimmune disease, doctors say it\u2019s difficult to know how to treat it. Some doctors, treating it as an active viral infection, may offer big doses of disease-fighting antibodies. But if AFM turns out to be an autoimmune disorder, it might be more appropriate to use steroids or a blood-filtering technique known as plasmapheresis, which removes harmful antibodies, said Anu Kalaskar, a pediatric infectious-disease specialist at Children\u2019s Minnesota.\n\nLast week, another potential treatment was found to be ineffective: A study in the journal Neurology found that the antidepressant fluoxetine, which had inhibited enterovirus D68 in lab tests, did not improve muscle strength in children with AFM.\n\nThe one intervention shown to offer benefits to all patients is extensive physical therapy. Other than that, \u201cwe still don\u2019t have good evidence on what is most effective,\u201d said Kevin Messacar, a pediatric infectious-disease specialist at Children\u2019s Hospital Colorado in Aurora who is advising the CDC.\n\n\n\nJourdan stretches his arms as part of his daily physical therapy. (Annie Flanagan for The Washington Post)\n\nMessacar is among the leading advocates of the enterovirus theory, arguing that rises in AFM cases have followed surges in cases of enterovirus D68. The CDC has not consistently found enterovirus D68 in cases of AFM, but Messacar and others say doctors need to look harder. The virus, which may be cleared from the body by the time muscle weakness appears, can be diagnosed only with special tests on nasal swabs and blood.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just not intuitive to look into the nose of someone\u201d who presents with paralysis, Messacar said.\n\nFor the family of Cooper Allen, 13, of Littleton, Colo., the past few months have been marked by uncertainty and fear. The eighth-grader was diagnosed in August and has a partially paralyzed left arm. His daily routine includes special exercises and electrical stimulation. He can bend his elbow and has full use of his fingers, but his shoulder and biceps are not working properly. He can\u2019t lift his arm above his head. He can no longer wrestle, a favorite sport since he was 5. When his 5-year-old sister fell off a stool next to him, he wasn\u2019t able to catch her.\n\n\u201cI tried to reach her, but I couldn\u2019t,\u201d he said.\n\nShe wasn\u2019t hurt. But as his mother, Amber Allen, recalled, \u201cIt was one of the only times Cooper has cried.\u201d\n\nCooper\u2019s parents are considering one of the latest interventions being offered to AFM patients \u2014 nerve transfer surgery, a long-standing technique that reroutes nerves from one part of the body to the injured area. But timing is critical. Pediatric surgeons say the ideal window is six to nine months from the date of onset.\n\n\n\nJourdan uses his strong arm to get dressed. (Annie Flanagan for The Washington Post)\n\nJourdan Loyola got sick in August 2016, on the third day of kindergarten. He was seen by at least three clinicians as his cough and lethargy developed into severe neck pain. Clinicians at an urgent-care clinic, a hospital emergency room and his pediatrician prescribed antibiotics. He was hospitalized for two months.\n\n\u201cThe fact that three doctors had seen this child before he became paralyzed just baffles the mind,\u201d said his mother, Chelsi, an emergency-room nurse.\n\nThe youngster now follows an extensive physical therapy program, with hours of daily exercises at his home on the outskirts of New Orleans. He and his mother travel for regular visits to Kennedy Krieger. They will spend his eighth birthday, which happens to fall on Thanksgiving, at the Baltimore facility.\n\n\n\nJourdan at home with his father, Joseph. (Annie Flanagan for The Washington Post)\n\nJourdan can bend his right arm at the elbow now and raise it about 30 degrees. It\u2019s still visibly thinner than his left. \u201cBut just to see it fatten up, oh, my God,\u201d she said.\n\nOn a recent afternoon at home, Jourdan pedaled with his arms for 30 minutes on a special bike that measures how hard his right arm (which he nicknamed \u201cGimpy\u201d) is working. Electrodes covering his arm sent pulses to 12 muscles.\n\nWith two minutes left, his right shoulder sagged from fatigue. His mother pushed it back against the chair so his arm could get the proper workout.\n\n\u201cPush it, push it,\u201d she told him.\n\n\u201cMama!\u201d he yelled out in pain.\n\n\u201cCome on, one minute left,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cOw!\u201d he yelled.\n\n\u201cCome on!\u201d she urged, not letting up. \u201cMake Gimpy do all the work.\u201d\n\nWith 30 seconds left, he pedaled hard and finished with a burst of speed.\n\nStretches and weights followed. Then he and his older brother Joseph played baseball in the driveway. Wearing a portable muscle stimulator, Jourdan gripped a bat with both hands and swung hard, his left arm guiding the weak right. He hit several balls in a row. One almost struck a car parked on the street.\n\n\u201cGood drive!\u201d his mother yelled as he turned to her with a grin.\n\n\u201cHigh-five! High-five with Gimpy,\u201d she said.\n\nShe didn\u2019t want to miss any chance to work his arm.\n\n\n\nJourdan plays with his family at their home.

Here\u2019s how it was worded:\n\nStern, factual, condemnatory: The statement is just like many others that rushed forth after CNN reporters have been barred, insulted and otherwise dissed by President Trump and his enablers in and around the White House. On Tuesday morning, the network signaled that it has tired of toothless tweets. Time to hit the courts.\n\nIn a filing just lodged in D.C. federal court, CNN is suing key White House officials and the Secret Service over Acosta\u2019s credentials. Listed as defendants in the civil action are Trump, Chief of Staff John Kelly, Deputy Chief of Staff for Communications Bill Shine, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders, Secret Service Director Randolph Alles and \u201cJohn Doe,\u201d the Secret Service employee who apprised Acosta that his hard pass had been revoked. The complaint itself notes the president\u2019s comments that Acosta had failed to \u201ctreat the White House with respect\u201d at an official event: \u201cThis severe and unprecedented punishment is the culmination of years of hostility by President Trump against CNN and Acosta based on the contents of their reporting\u2014an unabashed attempt to censor the press and exclude reporters from the White House who challenge and dispute the President\u2019s point of view.\u201d\n\nNor is the revocation a surmountable problem, argues CNN and its lawyer, Theodore J. Boutrous Jr., of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP. Without a hard pass, a White House correspondent must secure day passes, which require a lot of hassle and bureaucracy. \u201cWithout this [hard pass] credential, a daily White House correspondent like Acosta effectively cannot do his or her job,\u201d says the complaint.\n\nFurthermore, the complaint notes that CNN Worldwide President Jeff Zucker appealed last week to Kelly, requesting that Acosta\u2019s hard pass be \u201creinstated immediately.\u201d Before the action, noted Zucker, \u201cno complaints were raised with CNN and there was no attempt to reach anyone at CNN before taking this unlawful action.\u201d\n\nProcess is a critical part of the CNN complaint. Yes, the document cites as its first cause of action a violation of the First Amendment. It rips the White House\u2019s flimsy initial rationale for de-credentialing Acosta \u2014 namely, that Acosta had placed his hands on an intern who was attempting to take the microphone from Acosta during last Wednesday\u2019s press conference. \u201cDefendants\u2019 justifications for impeding Plaintiffs\u2019 First Amendment rights are hollow and hardly sufficiently compelling to justify the indefinite revocation of Acosta\u2019s White House credentials. Consequently, the only reasonable inference from Defendants\u2019 conduct is that they have revoked Acosta\u2019s credentials as a form of content- and viewpoint-based discrimination and in retaliation for Plaintiffs\u2019 exercise of protected First Amendment activity,\u201d notes the complaint.\n\nYet there\u2019s also a Fifth Amendment component \u2014 that the White House didn\u2019t follow due process in taking this very harsh action. \u201cDefendants did not provide Plaintiffs a written explanation, nor any explanation at all, before revoking Acosta\u2019s press credentials. The only written explanation was a short statement posted on Twitter that Acosta was suspended because he \u2018plac[ed] his hands\u2019 on a White House staffer. Even if this tweet were accurate\u2014and it is not, as the reportedly doctored video Defendant Sanders posted would later show\u2014it would not suffice to demonstrate prior notice of the revocation.\u201d\n\nAs a remedy, the suit asks for \u201cimmediate restoration of Acosta\u2019s press credentials and hard pass so that Plaintiffs may continue to report from White House briefings and perform their jobs on White House grounds and at other presidential events.\u201d Failing that, it petitions for a process under which Acosta\u2019s hard pass is restored under a \u201cdue process\u201d outlined in the complaint.\n\nCNN and its lawyers have had some time to mull its legal options. That\u2019s because a measure even this drastic has had plenty of buildup. During his presidential campaign, candidate Trump barred various news organizations from his events. And even though he indicated that he wouldn\u2019t deploy such extreme tactics as president, occasional access problems have surfaced in the first two years of his administration. CNN was among a number of outlets barred from a February 2017 briefing. And White House reporter Kaitlan Collins was excluded from an event open to the media in the summer, apparently a penalty for asking tough questions at an earlier press availability.\n\nAs noted in this blog, the yanking of press credentials for a White House reporter is an extreme rarity. \u201cI don\u2019t know of anything comparable to this,\u201d said George Condon, a historian of the White House press corps, in a previous post. On Sunday\u2019s media show on CNN, legendary First Amendment lawyer Floyd Abrams said, \u201cI can understand CNN being reluctant to sue because the president keeps saying CNN is the enemy of me and CNN might have some reluctance to have a lawsuit titled CNN versus Donald Trump. That said, yes, I think they should sue. And if it\u2019s not about Acosta, this is going to happen again.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s right about that, at least if you place any credence in Trump\u2019s own words. When the president was asked late last week about Acosta\u2019s de-credentialing, he responded that there could be \u201cothers\u201d who may receive the same treatment.\n\nIn the coverage of this lawsuit, prepare to see a fair bit of analysis calling it the escalation of a feud between the network and Trump. Don\u2019t be fooled, however: The escalation occurred on Jan. 11, 2017, when Trump called Acosta \u201cfake news\u201d after he asked about the Russian dossier; it occurred when Trump used his Twitter account and other forums to transmit that same message to his base; it occurred when Trump lent his Twitter name to memes of CNN being beaten up or run over; it occurred when Trump\u2019s press secretaries insulted Acosta; and so on. And there\u2019s no feud when a White House deploys the power of the state against a news organization. That\u2019s called a federal beatdown.\n\nUpdate: White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders issued this statement on the lawsuit:", "\n\nA vintage car rests among debris in Paradise, Calif.

The National Symphony Orchestra will present Benjamin Britten\u2019s \u201cWar Requiem\u201d this month, written to commemorate the end of the Second World War, but setting poems by Wilfred Owen about the first.\n\nOn Monday, baritone John Brancy and pianist Peter Dugan return with a program called \u201cArmistice: The Journey Home,\u201d a follow-up to the 2014 program \u201cA Silent Night,\u201d also based on the Christmas Truce, which they first offered at Vocal Arts DC and have since performed around the world. This weekend, the New Orchestra of Washington (NOW) presents an Armistice Day commemoration with the Washington Master Chorale that includes a world premiere by Joseph Turrin; last month, the Cathedral Choral Society offered the premiere of a massive Requiem that the composer Alexander Kastalsky wrote in 1918 to commemorate the millions of fallen soldiers. And that\u2019s only a sampling of the programs offered by the Thirteen, Choralis and many others.\n\nClassical music loves anniversaries \u2014 because, more than any other branch of the arts, it\u2019s focused on looking at an increasingly distant past. Classical music comes into its own at times of commemoration and mourning: Even the mass audience tends to embrace classical music at a funeral. And classical music, as it\u2019s commonly thought of today, was mostly written in Europe before World War I ended \u2014 in the part of the world that was most deeply affected by the devastating changes of the war, which took place as classical music was already going through an upheaval. (Stravinsky\u2019s \u201cRite of Spring,\u201d that 20th-century watershed, had its premiere in 1913, a year before war broke out.)\n\nToday, when classical music is eager to reassert its relevance to the world at large, this kind of historical presentation appeals to presenters. The question is whether these Armistice observances actually prove classical music\u2019s relevance or simply serve to wrap history in a PBS soundtrack of nostalgia.\n\nOne argument for World War I commemorations is the vast literature of World War I music. In 1914, when the war began, classical music was a far more popular idiom than it is today. The artists and musicians who were affected by the war expressed their thoughts in symphonies and piano works rather than in protest songs. Today, the pianist Dugan says, \u201cbecause we\u2019re not dealing with the draft, we don\u2019t have as much of a sense anymore of an army that\u2019s made up of writers and composers and musicians. That makes for a very different feel in terms of the kind of art that\u2019s being produced.\u201d And commemorative music at the time was far more likely to have traction than it is today, when a piece such as \u201cOn the Transmigration of Souls,\u201d John Adams\u2019s 2002 memorial to the 9/11 attacks, can win the Pulitzer Prize without attracting much popular attention.\n\nBrancy and Dugan\u2019s 2014 \u201cSilent Night\u201d program focused on composers who had seen military action, George Butterworth and Carl Orff among them. NOW\u2019s program this weekend, too, includes commemorations from Maurice Ravel, who drove a truck in the war and dedicated the movements of his famous \u201cLe tombeau de Couperin\u201d to friends who died in World War I; and Gustav Holst, who was rejected as unfit for military service and who wrote his \u201cOde to Death\u201d in memory of friends who had died. The City Choir of Washington offers works by Gerald Finzi, who lost three siblings, and Ralph Vaughan Williams, who saw action himself.\n\nBut to be truly relevant in today\u2019s market, many people feel you need new work, and commissioning new compositions about specific historic events is never easy. All too often, you end up with something portentous and stilted, a knockoff of Copland\u2019s \u201cLincoln Portrait\u201d \u2014 such as Peter Lieberson\u2019s \u201cRemembering JFK (An American Elegy),\u201d commissioned by the NSO and premiered in 2011, which didn\u2019t even have the modest half-life I predicted for it at the time as a ceremonial catchall. If you\u2019re writing music about World War I, do you have an imperative to make music that evokes the early 20th century?\n\nAlejandro Hernandez-Valdez, artistic director of NOW, is happy to program Radiohead on his concert: \u201cHarry Patch (in memory of)\u201d was inspired by a radio interview with the last living World War I combat veteran of the trenches, who died in 2009 at age 111. (The song was orchestrated by Radiohead member-cum-classical composer, Johnny Greenwood.) But when it came to selecting a composer for the co-commission, there was some discussion before Turrin was selected, to make sure they found a musical voice that fit. (The piece, called \u201cAnd Crimson Roses Once Again Be Fair,\u201d is set to poetry by World War I-era writers.) \u201cHe has the right kind of sound,\u201d Hernandez-Valdez said. \u201cHe writes in a very lyrical way, but definitely contemporary.\u201d\n\nBy the same token, Puts, the \u201cSilent Night\u201d composer, is very much a tonalist, writing music with a cinematic quality. For this opera, however, the historical setting gave a dramatic rather than a musical impetus; he explicitly opted not to work historical music references into his score, even writing new Christmas carols rather than using familiar ones. It\u2019s an interesting decision, given that the opera is so imbued with a sense of time and place that it would be virtually impossible to update to any other historical period. You can make a case for \u201cRigoletto\u201d in Mafia-era New York, but it\u2019s hard to pretend that this kind of cease-fire, so innocent and naive, could have happened in Vietnam or Iraq.\n\nThere is, of course, nothing wrong with only using music of the past; programmers do it all the time. And the challenge is, in microcosm, the same one that faces the field as a whole: How do you present the past in ways that make it come to life?\n\nFor Brancy and Dugan, the answer proved to be a new model of song recital \u2014 \u201creinventing the way a program is structured,\u201d Dugan said, \u201cwhere all of the individual songs and elements combine to create one theme, that often resonates with areas outside of music.\u201d The pair will record the new project for release early next year, after an exhaustive tour \u2014 eight cities in 11 days, they calculated last week \u2014 that demonstrates proof of concept, taking them from their Alice Tully Hall debut to a performance at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. Since their first concert, they have been sponsored by the leading World War I commemorative organizations in the United States, Britain, and France. Monday\u2019s concert is co-sponsored by the General Delegation of the Government of Flanders to the United States.\n\nThis kind of extramusical buy-in is a sign that a program has meaningfully connected with its subject: making people confront and think about World War I rather than simply offering a couple of hours of historicized reverie about an event that no longer looms large in the popular imagination. Indeed, all World War I concerts should be trying to connect with the historical realities of the time, rather than retreating into the wistful, nostalgic classical music trope: mourning the closing of a cultural door on the 19th century \u2014 a door that some purists are still fighting to keep open.\n\nA few noteworthy World War I commemorations in the Washington area: \u201cSilent Night\u201d runs at the Washington National Opera through Nov. 25. Gianandrea Noseda will lead the NSO and the Choral Arts Society in Britten\u2019s War Requiem from Nov. 29 to Dec.1. John Brancy and Peter Dugan will present \u201cArmistice: The Journey Home\u201d at Vocal Arts DC on Monday. The New Orchestra of Washington\u2019s \u201cEnd of the War to End All Wars\u201d concert, which was performed Saturday night, will repeat in New York City on Sunday. The City Choir of Washington offers \u201cA Farewell to Arms\u201d on Sunday.

(Aaron Lavinsky/AP)\n\nReported hate crimes in America rose 17 percent last year, the third consecutive year that such crimes increased, according to newly released FBI data that showed an even larger increase in anti-Semitic attacks.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies reported that 7,175 hate crimes occurred in 2017, up from 6,121 in 2016. That increase was fueled in part by more police departments reporting hate crime data to the FBI, but overall there is still a large number of departments that report no hate crimes to the federal database.\n\nThe sharp increase in hate crimes in 2017 came even as overall violent crime in America fell slightly, by 0.2 percent, after increases in 2015 and 2016.\n\n[Hate crimes are soaring but many jurisdictions still don\u2019t report any]\n\nMore than half of hate crimes, about 3 out of every 5, targeted a person\u2019s race or ethnicity, while about 1 out of 5 targeted their religion. Of the more than 7,000 incidents reported last year, 2,013 targeted black Americans, while 938 targeted Jewish Americans. Incidents targeting people for their sexual orientation accounted for 1,130 hate crimes, according to the FBI.\n\nThe FBI has urged local police departments to provide more complete information about hate crimes in their jurisdictions.\n\nOf the more than 7,000 hate crime incidents in 2017, more than 4,000 were crimes against people, ranging from threats and intimidation to assault, to murder. More than 3,000 were crimes against property, ranging from vandalism to robbery to arson.\n\nActing attorney general Matthew G. Whitaker said the new figures are \u201ca call to action \u2014 and we will heed that call. The Department of Justice\u2019s top priority is to reduce violent crime in America, and hate crimes are violent crimes. They are also despicable violations of our core values as Americans.\u201d\n\n[Pittsburgh shooting comes amid rise in hate crimes, growing anxiety about right-wing extremism]\n\nWhitaker said he was \u201cparticularly troubled by the increase in anti-Semitic hate crimes,\u201d which are already the most common type of religious hate crime in the United States.\n\nAnti-Semitic hate crimes rose 37 percent in 2017. Anti-Islamic hate crimes declined 11 percent last year, with 273 such incidents, the data show.\n\nThe new FBI data comes less than a month after the worst anti-Semitic attack in U.S. history \u2014 a shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue that killed 11 and wounded six. The suspect in that attack has been charged with dozens of federal hate crimes, and that one incident alone accounted for nearly as many hate crime killings as were recorded all of last year in the United States: 15.\n\nJonathan A. Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, said the report \u201cprovides further evidence that more must be done to address the divisive climate of hate in America. That begins with leaders from all walks of life and from all sectors of society forcefully condemning anti-Semitism, bigotry, and hate whenever it occurs.\u201d", "As lawsuits fly in Georgia and Florida over provisional ballots, signature matches and county vote-counting delays, Maine\u2019s ranked-choice voting tabulation is in the legal crosshairs, as well.\n\nAccording to the Portland Press Herald, incumbent Rep. Bruce Poliquin (R) filed a federal lawsuit against Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap on Tuesday demanding that federal election returns be counted \u201cin accordance with traditional \u2014 and constitutional \u2014 procedures.\u201d Three Republican voters joined his request for a permanent injunction against the state\u2019s tabulation of ranked-choice ballots.\n\nPoliquin held a razor-thin lead, according to the Maine Secretary of State\u2019s office the day after the election, of about 1,000 votes or 0.2 percent, over state Rep. Jared Golden (D) after the first-choice ballots of all voters were counted. But because he did not win more than 50 percent of the votes outright, Maine\u2019s ranked-choice voting rounds kicked into effect for the first time in U.S. history to decide the outcome of a federal race.\n\nRanked-choice voting is a new voting method that Maine passed by statewide referendum in 2016 and upheld in 2018. It\u2019s often referred to as instant-runoff voting and is explained in detail in the video at the top of this post. In ranked-choice voting, voters rank their choices instead of selecting only one candidate on their ballots. If the leading candidate doesn\u2019t win more than 50 percent of votes, then the candidate with the least amount of votes is eliminated, and their voters\u2019 second-choice candidates get those votes instead. In Maine, the rounds of elimination continue until there are only two candidates with the most votes left, and then a winner is declared.\n\n[Can ranked-choice voting end ugly election battles? Maine hopes to find out.]\n\nMaine\u2019s implementation of ranked-choice voting faced steep opposition from many Republicans in the state. Before the election, Poliquin had refused to say that he would accept the use of ranked-choice tabulation, leading many to think that the voting method would face a court challenge.\n\nTwo independents, Tiffany Bond and Will Hoar, garnered about 8 percent of the vote in Maine\u2019s 2nd District on Election Day. Their voters\u2019 second- and potentially third-choice votes will be added to Poliquin and Golden\u2019s vote totals, in a lengthy process of shipping, scanning and certifying ballots in the Augusta State House.\n\nThe secretary of state\u2019s office has been at work since Nov. 9 to tabulate the ranked-choice ballots and had seven more counties\u2019 ballots to scan as of Monday evening.", "FILE - In this Sept. 29, 2018 file photo, a cargo ship is docked at the Red Sea port city, of Hodeida, Yemen.

Only three coalition airstrikes were carried out in the last 24 hours, targeting rebel positions outside the city.\n\nThe truce followed advances by the coalition in their latest attempt to retake the city from the Shiite rebels, known as Houthis, with its forces now 5 kilometers (3 miles) short of the port, Yemen\u2019s traditional lifeline.\n\nThe officials said efforts were being made to persuade the Houthis to abandon the city and hand over control to an independent Yemeni party that would run the port under U.N. supervision. The Houthis, who had in the past rejected the proposal, said the coalition accepted the truce because of its heavy casualties and because it came under international pressure to spare some 500,000 civilians inside the city the death and destruction that come with street-to-street fighting, which already began this week.\n\nThe military and Houthi officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media.\n\nThe U.N. envoy to Yemen, Martin Griffiths, welcomed the reduction of hostilities and said it was a \u201ccrucial step\u201d to prevent further humanitarian suffering.\n\n\u201cI call upon all parties to the conflict to show continued restraint. The people of Yemen have suffered enough. I am confident that the parties are ready to work on a political solution and am encouraged by the constructive engagement received from all sides,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nGriffiths, said the statement, reassured the warring sides that the U.N. remained ready to re-engage the parties on a negotiated agreement for Hodeida, which would protect the port and preserve the humanitarian pipeline.\n\nU.N. humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock echoed Griffiths\u2019 call on all parties to show restraint and reiterated the U.N.\u2019s readiness \u201cto play an enhanced role in ensuring the appropriate use of key facilities, especially around Hodeida.\u201d\n\n\u201cI ask that the parties implement a cessation of hostilities, not least in and around all the infrastructure and facilities on which the aid operation and commercial importers rely,\u201d Lowcock said in a statement. \u201cAll parties must live up to their obligations under international humanitarian law.\u201d\n\nThe coalition has been battling the rebels on the side of Yemen\u2019s internationally recognized government since March 2015 in a war that has killed tens of thousands of people and pushed much of the country to the brink of starvation.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Edith M.

But Pope Benedict XVI sent him to his native Malta in 2012 as bishop after Scicluna\u2019s tough line ruffled too many feathers in the Vatican.\n\nScicluna\u2019s new appointment is symbolically significant and will also give him greater say in the day-to-day running of the congregation, even though he technically retains his post in Malta.\n\nScicluna\u2019s Valletta office said Tuesday that he\u2019ll be in Rome \u201con a regular basis\u201d and that a deputy will take over running the archdiocese when he\u2019s away, suggesting Scicluna intends the job to be more than part-time.\n\nFrancis clearly trusts Scicluna after he asked him to conduct an in-depth investigation in Chile earlier this year that revealed Francis\u2019 gross misunderstanding of an abuse and cover-up scandal there.\n\nScicluna\u2019s return to Rome comes as Francis and the church at large are under fire again for the way the Vatican and religious superiors around the globe turned a blind eye to priests who raped and molested children.\n\nThe crisis is particularly acute in the U.S., where prosecutors in more than a dozen states have announced investigations into abuse and cover-up following the revelations of the Pennsylvania grand jury report.\n\nIn addition, U.S. bishops are reeling from allegations that one of their own, ex-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, preyed on seminarians and at least two minors, and that his misconduct with adults was an open secret in the U.S. and Vatican.\n\nFrancis\u2019 record on abuse has long been uneven, and his papacy has been rocked by claims by a Vatican archbishop that he rehabilitated McCarrick in 2013 from sanctions imposed by Benedict.\n\nFrancis\u2019 credibility took another hit this week when the Vatican blocked U.S. bishops from voting on a new code of conduct and a commission involving lay experts to review complaints against brother bishops.\n\nUnder church law, only the pope can investigate and discipline bishops.\n\nThe head of the U.S. conference, Cardinal Daniel DiNardo, admitted the Vatican only received the text after it was finalized Oct. 30, and said Rome had flagged legal problems with it.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Peter Dejong/Associated Press)\n\nTHE HAGUE, Netherlands \u2014 A new investigative team being set up to apportion blame for poison gas and nerve agent attacks in Syria will be ready to start work early next year, the chief of the global chemical weapons watchdog said Tuesday.\n\nThe Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons voted in June to begin apportioning blame for attacks after Russia vetoed a United Nations Security Council resolution last November to extend the mandate of a joint UN-OPCW investigative team seeking to establish responsibility for a string of chemical attacks in Syria.\n\nThe joint team accused Syria of using chlorine gas in at least two attacks in 2014 and 2015, and the nerve agent sarin in an attack in April 2017 in the town of Khan Sheikhoun that killed about 100 people. The UN-OPCW team also accused the Islamic State extremist group of using mustard gas twice in 2015 and 2016.\n\nOPCW Director-General Fernando Arias said that a coordinator for the team has already been appointed and more experts and analysts are being hired.\n\n\u201cWe are setting up the team of experts,\u201d Arias said, calling it a \u201csmall but very powerful team\u201d with \u201chigh capacities that will be ready to start working in the first weeks of next year.\u201d\n\nThe organization\u2019s member states are meeting next week and must approve its annual budget, which also will cover the new team\u2019s work.\n\nArias said he was optimistic about the outcome of financial negotiations, \u201cand I think that we\u2019ll have a budget for the organization.\u201d\n\nThe team, expected to comprise of about 10 to 12 investigators supported by experts and chemical inspectors who already work at the OPCW, will be able to look back at attacks for which the previous UN-OPCW team did not apportion blame.\n\nOne notorious allegation still being investigated by weapons inspectors is the suspected chemical attack in April in the Syrian town of Douma. An interim report said that weapons inspectors found \u201cvarious chlorinated organic chemicals\u201d at the site of the alleged Douma attack. Arias said that more samples are being studied to reach a final conclusion.\n\nThe OPCW made headlines last month when Dutch authorities revealed that they had foiled an alleged plot by Russian spies to hack into the organization\u2019s WiFi network using equipment stashed in the trunk of a rental car parked at a hotel next to the OPCW headquarters.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov rejected the OPCW spying allegation, calling the hacking claim a \u201cmisunderstanding.\u201d\n\nArias said the alleged plot was not the first attempted hack.\n\n\u201cWe have had attacks since the beginning of this year - cyberattacks,\u201d he said. \u201cWe take that very seriously. It is not my mission to investigate the origin but my mission is to protect the IT system of the organization where we have confidential information. We have adopted very serious measures to guarantee that the system is very well protected.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Engel (N.Y.), the ranking Democrat on the House Foreign Relations Committee, on Capitol Hill in May. (Leah Millis/Reuters)\n\nOpinion writer\n\nWe tend to think of congressional oversight as identical to investigating scandals. The latter is only one aspect of oversight. That need for basic oversight (What are we doing and why? What are the results? Who decided on this disastrous strategy?) is as great, if not greater, on the foreign-policy side than on the domestic side. Simply because presidents have the power \u2014 the exclusive power in some cases \u2014 to conduct foreign policy does not mean they are immune from oversight. To the contrary, oversight is especially important to ensure transparency and accountability on that foreign policy.\n\nThere are certainly discrete questions that must be answered. \u201cWhat did President Trump say to Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki?\u201d \u201cWhat action are we taking against Saudi Arabia in response to the murder and dismemberment of journalist Jamal Khashoggi?\u201d However, on virtually every issue, there is a disconnect between official \u201cpolicy\u201d and what we are actually doing. And that is a problem.\n\nThe administration\u2019s official policy laid out in the 2017 National Security Strategy says we are supposed to \u201cdeepen collaboration with our European allies and partners to confront forces threatening to undermine our common values, security interests, and shared vision. The United States and Europe will work together to counter Russian subversion and aggression, and the threats posed by North Korea and Iran. We will continue to advance our shared principles and interests in international forums.\u201d Does anyone think Trump is doing this?\n\nKori Schake ably explains the fundamental problem in a piece that should be read in full. However, one particular section deserves emphasis:\n\nThere is no substitute for having a strategy married to its times, to use Defense Secretary Jim Mattis\u2019s term for the proper embedding of politics into strategy. The crafters of President Trump\u2019s National Security Strategy heroically attempted to do just this, harnessing the president\u2019s campaign agenda in developing the 2017 strategy. And, to their credit, it is a reasonable enough strategy \u2014 far better than we had any right to expect, given the president\u2019s erratic and often unsound predilections. But their effort may now be judged a failure on the grounds of both irrelevance and potential disaster. Irrelevance, because Trump\u2019s policies do not bear much resemblance to the confines of the National Security Strategy on any number of issues \u2014 Russia, American relationships with allies, or the importance of providing the resources necessary to achieve the strategy\u2019s objectives in the first place. And potential disaster because the president is conveying deep unhappiness with the costs and consequences of those policies consistent with the strategy, such as the Afghanistan war and stabilizing involvement in Syria and Iraq, and has even called into question whether he will sustain those policies at all. He may yet balk and abruptly change course.\n\nIn practice, congressional oversight of foreign policy should look at each major international challenge and determine what our policy is (if we even have one) and whether it is working. Are the means calculated to obtain the desired result? For example, one section of our Indo-Pacific strategy is supposed to be the commitment to \u201cwork with allies and partners to achieve complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula and preserve the non-proliferation regime in Northeast Asia.\u201d An oversight hearing on Asia, and on North Korea specifically, would explore questions such as:\n\nDoes pulling out of Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) make that harder or easier?\n\nWhat evidence is there that the Singapore Summit affected North Korea\u2019s conduct given reports such as this: \u201cVarious satellite images this summer have shown North Korea expanding several key missile production facilities and rapidly upgrading its main nuclear research facility at Yongbyon, even after a historic June 12 summit meeting between President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore.\u201d\n\nIf it isn\u2019t working what are we doing about it? Did the summit undercut the impression of maximum pressure we were trying to project?\n\nAre sanctions more or less porous since the summit?\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo has been rude, evasive and nonresponsive when questioned in the past. Committee members should not countenance this in the future.\n\nWhether it is Afghanistan (are we still accomplishing anything?), or Syria (what we are doing is calculated to do . . . what, exactly?), or China (is the trade war working), we see that the failures of Republicans in the House and Senate has led to an utter lack of transparency and accountability on administration policies, which often seem disconnected from individual actions we are taking. (If we really think there is a peace process in Israel, why did we move our Embassy to Jerusalem? If we are committed to fighting cyberwarfare, why did we let Chinese telecommunications giant ZTE off the hook? If we don\u2019t challenge Iran in Syria, how can we say we\u2019re challenging its hegemonic ambitions in the region?)\n\nCome to think of it, we might have a foreign policy disconnected from individual actions because oversight has been minimal \u2014 if not entirely nonexistent.\n\nRead more from Jennifer Rubin:\n\nWhat Democrats\u2019 big win in Arizona means\n\nHow to lose in 2020 if you are a Republican\n\nThree options for conscientious Republicans (or ex-Republicans)", "(Update: The Amazon HQ2 locations are revealed \u2014 and so is the price tag)\n\nAmazon will open major new outposts in Northern Virginia\u2019s Crystal City and in New York City, splitting its much-sought investment of up to 50,000 jobs between the two East Coast sites, the company announced Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWe are excited to build new headquarters in New York City and Northern Virginia,\u201d Amazon founder and CEO Jeffrey P. Bezos said in a statement. \u201cThese two locations will allow us to attract world-class talent that will help us to continue inventing for customers for years to come. The team did a great job selecting these sites, and we look forward to becoming an even bigger part of these communities.\u201d\n\nThe company also announced that it has selected Nashville for 5,000 jobs as part of a new Center of Excellence for its Operations business, which is responsible for the company\u2019s customer fulfillment, transportation, supply chain and similar activities.\n\n[Amazon HQ2 to receive more than $2.8 billion in incentives from Virginia, New York and Tennessee]\n\nThe choice of Crystal City in Arlington County as one of the winners cements Northern Virginia\u2019s reputation as a magnet for business and will potentially reshape the Washington region into an eastern outpost of Silicon Valley over the next decade.\n\nThe selections came with a price tag, details of which are just becoming public. Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) and Arlington County leaders agreed to give Amazon $819 million based on the company creating 25,000 jobs with an average wage of $150,000.\n\nThe money, which is subject to approval by the Virginia General Assembly, also includes $195 million in transportation improvements to nearby Metro stations, Reagan National Airport and to construct pedestrian bridge connecting to company\u2019s new hub, which will be in a newly-branded neighborhood called \u201cNational Landing, encompassing parts of Pentagon City and Crystal City in Arlington and Potomac Yard in Alexandria.\n\nVirginia Tech plans to build a $1 billion graduate campus in Alexandria focused on innovation, part of the higher education offerings the state offered the company.\n\n[Read Virginia\u2019s agreement with Amazon]\n\nNew York leaders offered more \u2014 $1.85 billion, much of it also tied to the company\u2019s job growth and salaries.\n\n\n\nThe waterfront of Long Island City in the Queens borough of New York, along the East River. Amazon is expected to locate part of its expansion project in the neighborhood. (Don Emmert/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe decision hands Northam and local leaders the largest economic-development prize in a generation \u2014 one promising billions of dollars in capital investments alone \u2014 but could also put pressure on the region\u2019s already steep housing prices, congested roads, and yawning divide between wealthy and low-income residents.\n\nNortham, in a statement, said he expected Amazon to invest $2.5 billion in the commonwealth and create $3.2 billion in tax revenue. He is expected to make the announcement at a Tuesday afternoon event.\n\nAccording to a 25-page agreement between the company and the state, Amazon expects to hire 400 people in 2019 and 1,180 the next year. It expects to create a minimum of 25,000 jobs by 2030 and potentially a total of 37,850 by 2034.\n\n\u201cThis is a big win for Virginia \u2014 I\u2019m proud Amazon recognizes the tremendous assets the Commonwealth has to offer and plans to deepen its roots here,\u201d he said.\n\nIt also represents a victory for New York Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D), who had joked that he would change his name to \u201cAmazon Cuomo\u201d if necessary to land the project.\n\n[How can the D.C. region absorb an Amazon headquarters if it can\u2019t cope now with gridlock and housing costs?]\n\nOther final suitors included the District, Montgomery County and 16 other jurisdictions Amazon considered since narrowing its list in January. D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) and Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) both applauded the announcement.\n\nNeither will have to pony up incentives to the company, but experts say both should see economic gains as a result. Bowser called on regional leaders to create concrete affordable housing goals \u2014 an acute problem that economists say is likely to worsen as Amazon grows.\n\n\u201cAmazon in Arlington is a win for D.C.,\u201d Bowser said in a statement. \u201cWe will continue preparing residents with the skills and knowledge they need for the jobs of the future, including at Amazon.\u201d\n\n[Northern Virginia property owners are delighted Amazon HQ2 is moving in. Renters, first-time buyers, and low-income residents aren\u2019t.]\n\nHogan said he expects to see other companies relocate to the region to be near Amazon. \u201cCollectively, we will not only gain 25,000 corporate-level jobs, but also many businesses that are part of Amazon\u2019s supply chain,\u201d Hogan said.\n\nAOL co-founder Steve Case, who now works with tech entrepreneurs in smaller cities, issued a statement encouraging them not to lose faith despite the selection of two East Coast stalwarts.\n\n\u201cThe best economic strategy is not to lure existing companies to open offices or factories, but instead to birth the new companies that could be the Amazons of tomorrow,\u201d he said. But in the same breath, the longtime Northern Virginia resident took a victory lap: \u201cAmazon\u2019s announcement is a win not just for VA, but also for the entire greater D.C. region.\u201d\n\nOpposition to the move started shortly after the announcement, as groups dedicated to fighting inequality and opposed to corporate subsidies began rallying their supporters in both New York and Virginia as details of the deal began to emerge.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been getting calls and outreach from Queens residents all day about this. The community\u2019s response? Outrage,\u201d said Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), who will take office in January.\n\nMany were concerned about the cost of living and questioned why a company run by Bezos \u2014 the world\u2019s wealthiest person \u2014 needed any public funds.\n\n\u201cThousands of new high-paying jobs could be a boon to our community, but we deserve to know the cost,\u201d said Anna Scholl, executive director of the advocacy group Progress Virginia. \u201cTens of thousands of new workers and their families are sure to strain community resources when it comes to affordable housing, mass transit and traffic, and quality local schools. It\u2019s only right that Amazon pay their fair share.\u201d\n\nJay Carney, Amazon senior vice president of worldwide corporate affairs, said that the company considered all the locations carefully and reviewed 100 different metrics, but ultimately made its decision \u2014 including the choice to split the project \u2014 based on how best the company could recruit the talent it needs.\n\n\u201cWe came to realize that of course these are two fantastic metropolitan areas, and each of the areas has an existing pool of talent and are fantastic places to live,\u201d he said in a phone interview.\n\n[How Crystal City, the future home of Amazon\u2019s new headquarters, got its name]\n\nCarney said that Amazon would apply some of the lessons it had learned from its growth in Seattle to its new locations. He said Bezos was \u201cinvolved very deeply\u201d in the process and was in every leadership meeting where it was discussed.\n\nAmazon\u2019s decision to split the project rather than open a second headquarters on par with its Seattle campus has angered some who said the company had ginned up competition among cities only to change the rules midstream. Some said it was unfair that the company seemed to be considering only sites in more affluent communities.\n\n\u201cOne thing that\u2019s different here is we are planning in advance with these cities. Amazon started in a garage. Nobody foresaw, not even Jeff, when they got launched that Amazon would become what it became or that we would have tens of thousands of employees in Seattle alone,\u201d Carney said.\n\nAmazon launched the project in the fall of 2017, dubbing it HQ2 and issuing search criteria for \u201ca second corporate headquarters\u201d with as many as 50,000 jobs and an investment of $5 billion.\n\n[Washington won its piece of Amazon\u2019s HQ2. Now comes the hard part.]\n\nIn picking Crystal City, Amazon opted for a close-in suburban site, just across the Potomac River from Washington and a half-mile from National Airport. Outdated buildings and underused properties now fill the site, where some office buildings have yawning vacancies.\n\nThe selection represents a triumph for the growth strategy of Arlington and Alexandria to promote development along mass-transit routes. The site is close to the Crystal City Metro station on the Blue and Yellow lines, and the planned Potomac Yard station scheduled to open in 2021.\n\nBut residents in the nearby Del Ray neighborhood in Alexandria expressed worry earlier this year that Amazon\u2019s arrival would worsen daily rush-hour backups that already slow traffic to a crawl, and would erode the quality of life in their neighborhood of mostly single-family homes.\n\nThe decision marks a dramatic upturn in fortune for Crystal City, which lost thousands of jobs when military agencies and defense contractors departed in the Pentagon\u2019s Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission (BRAC) process, beginning in 2005.\n\nThe initial building that Amazon will occupy is at 1851 South Bell St. or 1770 Crystal Dr. in Arlington, according to individuals familiar with the decision.\n\nOne advantage is that the properties are all overseen by a single, well-capitalized company, JBG Smith. The $4.4 billion firm is the region\u2019s biggest real estate owner and most active developer, and it owns a majority of the property in the bid \u2014 enough to accommodate the entire project on its own in Crystal City and Potomac Yard.\n\nAmazon\u2019s choice also burnishes Northern Virginia\u2019s standing as an attractive site for corporate headquarters. In the past 15 years, it has lured Volkswagen Group of America to Herndon, Northrop Grumman to Falls Church, Hilton Worldwide to Tysons and Nestle\u2019s U.S. headquarters to Arlington.\n\n[Amazon\u2019s HQ2 split sparks backlash from locals, politicians]\n\nNortham said in March that the state\u2019s pitch centered on workforce development, inclusivity and transportation, along with quality of life.\n\nAlthough 238 locations initially submitted proposals to Amazon, many experts considered the Washington region a favorite from the outset because of Bezos\u2019s personal connections in the region, particularly the $23 million mansion he purchased in the city\u2019s Kalorama neighborhood last year and his ownership of The Post.\n\nOthers suggested that Amazon executives wanted to be near Washington to cozy up to the federal government, either because of increased concerns that regulators may pursue antitrust actions against the company or because the government has become a critical Amazon customer.\n\nVirginia also offers the political advantage of being a purple state, making it easier for the company to seek support from both parties.\n\nAmazon previously announced that it would headquarter its cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services, in Herndon, near some of its data centers.\n\nThe Washington area also naturally fit many of the criteria Amazon called for in its search, among them a deep pool of talented workers, a robust public-transit system and easy airport access.\n\nAmazon launched its search in September 2017, vowing to make a decision by the end of 2018 and occupy an initial building of 500,000 square feet in 2019.\n\nThe company says its Seattle headquarters has injected $38 billion beyond what the company spent on its buildings into the area economy, generating an additional $1.40 for every dollar the company spent.\n\nSeattle officials have not disputed the figures, but they have also been racing to keep up with the company\u2019s staggering growth and the requirements it places on public transit, schools, road networks, parks and utilities. The company now has more than 45,000 employees, occupying more than 40 buildings and 10 million square feet of office space.\n\nCompared with other large corporations, Amazon employees are less likely to commute by car, as about 55 percent either walk, bike or take public transit, according to a survey the company did of its Seattle workforce. The company purchases transit cards for employees and is building a dedicated cycle track to separate bikes from cars near its Seattle buildings.\n\nAmazon\u2019s growth is also likely to put new strains on housing. Since Amazon\u2019s arrival, Seattle has become one of the most expensive places in the United States to live, forcing lower-income residents to move to far-off suburbs. The city and surrounding King County declared a state of emergency in 2015 over homelessness.\n\nEven without Amazon, the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments estimated that the region needs to add 235,000 housing units by 2025 to keep pace with expected job growth. Amazon\u2019s arrival could push the goal above 267,000, according to a recent analysis by the Urban Institute. Right now it is on pace to add about 170,000 new units by 2026.\n\nSince beginning the headquarters search, Bezos and the company have made several announcements that could soften Amazon\u2019s image as it moves to open its second hub.\n\nBezos announced in September that he would donate $2 billion of his own money to support groups battling homelessness in America and to create a network of preschools in underserved communities. In October \u2014 after bearing months of criticism from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) over its treatment of workers \u2014 Amazon announced that it would raise its minimum wage for all employees to $15 per hour.\n\nThe minimum-wage decision isn\u2019t likely to have much effect on the company\u2019s hiring in Northern Virginia, where Amazon says its facility will employ mainly white-collar workers with an average salary of more than $100,000 a year.\n\nBefore Amazon announced its search, Washington-area jurisdictions \u2014 forced in part by federal budget cuts \u2014 had already been diversifying their workforces away from a reliance on federal spending. The region gained more than 55,000 jobs annually from 2015 to 2017 despite budget cuts and stagnation in Congress. But its job growth has been slower than average among major metropolitan areas.\n\nPatricia Sullivan, Gregory S.

(David Santiago/Miami Herald via AP)\n\nOn any Election Day, the first analyses of turnout are anecdotal. Long lines at particular places. Commentary from poll workers about how the turnout looks relative to prior years. Stories of unexpectedly long lines or the unexpected absence of same. As with any similar reporting, caution is warranted in extrapolating: Just because the line at your polling place was long doesn\u2019t mean that turnout nationally was unusually high.\n\nSometimes, though, that line isn\u2019t giving the wrong impression. Last week, turnout was unusually high, according to estimates from the University of Florida\u2019s Michael McDonald. It lagged behind presidential-year voting, but that has happened consistently for nearly 200 years.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nCompared to other midterms, 2018 turnout is estimated at the highest in a century, edging out a surge in turnout in the middle of the last century that peaked in 1966.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nPut another way: Midterm turnout is estimated to have been higher than at any point since women were given the right to vote.\n\nBut why?\n\nExit polling would suggest a surge in older voters. In 2016, voters aged 65 and older were estimated to make up 16 percent of the electorate. Last week, exit polls had that figure at 26 percent.\n\nThose numbers probably aren\u2019t directly comparable. As the New York Times\u2019s Nate Cohn notes, the methodology used by Edison Media Research, the go-to exit polling firm, changed between the two elections. This year had a higher-than-normal midterm turnout election, but 2016 turnout was still higher. So it makes sense that the density of older voters would be higher in 2018 than 2016, given that older people tend to vote more regularly than younger people. But a 10-point jump? That should raise some eyebrows.\n\nCatalist, a left-leaning data firm, did its own analysis of the electorate in 2018, using its voter file and reported data to compile estimates for the composition of the electorate that can be compared to 2016 and the 2014 midterms. It reports a jump in 65-and-older voters from 2016, but of seven points, not 10. Correlated: Density of younger voters was down by five percentage points.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nBut comparing to 2016 doesn\u2019t necessarily tell us why midterm turnout was up. Comparing to 2014 answers that question more directly. Since 2014, the percentage of the electorate that is under the age of 40 was up more than three percentage points. Voters under 30 made up 2 percent more of the electorate than in 2014, as did voters age 30 to 39. Those younger voters, exit polls tell us, voted overwhelmingly for Democratic candidates.\n\nNow bear in mind that composition of the electorate is evaluated in percentage points, not number of voters. So if the number of voters surged in 2018 relative to 2014, there were increases in the number of voters in each group. It\u2019s just that the younger and older voters had a larger relative increase than did voters age 40 to 64. There were still far more voters in that midrange age group! But fewer relative to younger voters than in 2014.\n\nShortly before the election, The Post and our partners at ABC News released a poll looking at how different educational and gender groups planned to vote. Among white women with a college degree, the Democrats had a 16-point advantage. Among white men without a degree, the Republicans had a nearly 40-point lead.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nSo how did those groups turn out? Catalist\u2019s data offers some insight.\n\nWhite men without a degree made up the same percentage of the electorate as in 2016 but, according to Catalist\u2019s data, 3 percent less of the electorate than in 2014. White women with a degree made up slightly more of the electorate relative to the last two elections.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nThese are subtle changes. When we overlay another factor -- urban vs. rural -- the figures stand out a bit more.\n\nWhites with college degrees (who backed Democrats over the Republicans regardless of gender) who live in suburban areas made up four percentage points more of the electorate than in 2014. Those without a degree in suburban areas made up three points less of the electorate.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nThere were still more of the latter voters in 2018, but while in 2014 suburban whites without college degrees made up nine percentage points more of the electorate than those with degrees, last week Catalist estimates that the difference was only two points.\n\nThat comports with the results of the election. Our analysis of where House seats flipped shows that it was largely in suburban areas. (The dark areas on the chart below show seats that flipped or where Democrats lead in districts held by Republicans. The light areas are seats won by each party that didn\u2019t flip.)\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nThe Catalist data suggest that turnout was up broadly, but that bigger increases relative to the composition of the 2014 electorate were seen among younger and older voters and among whites with college degrees in suburban areas.\n\nThere\u2019s another trend noted in that data. The density of the white vote in the electorate has slid downward over time. The 2008 electorate that elected Barack Obama as president had the same percentage of nonwhite voters as did the electorate in 2014. Catalist estimates that the density of the white vote in 2018 was three points lower than in 2014, and nonwhite voters broadly supported Democrats over Republicans.\n\nThe turnout surge was across the board, but uneven. Where the surge was larger, it tended to favor the Democrats. As the results indicate.", "\n\nEnglish-born U.S. players Antonee Robinson, second from right, and Cameron Carter-Vickers, right, take part in a U.S. training session in West London on Monday. (Matt Dunham/Associated Press)\n\nLONDON \u2014 Listening to Antonee Robinson and Cameron Carter-Vickers speak, hearing those British accents and vocabulary this week at U.S. national soccer team training camp, one could not help but think they had taken a terribly wrong turn on their way to the English headquarters at St. George\u2019s Park in West Midlands.\n\nBoth were born and raised in England, joined youth academies run by Premier League clubs and have plied their trade in these parts since turning pro.\n\nBoth are also U.S. citizens, sons of American fathers who happened to excel in college sports: Final Fours in basketball and soccer, respectively.\n\nEligible and capable, Robinson and Carter-Vickers are members of a new wave of players being integrated into a program that missed the 2018 World Cup in spectacularly miserable fashion.\n\n[Klinsmann is joining U.S. national soccer team (Jonathan, that is)]\n\nAnd on Thursday, they\u2019ll find themselves in the awkward and awesome situation of facing England \u2014 the team they adored in their youth \u2014 at Wembley Stadium, hallowed ground for any English footballer.\n\nCarter-Vickers said, \u201cIt will be a little weird.\"\n\nRobinson added, \u201cSuch a big stage, to actually step out and play there, it\u2019s going to be unreal.\"\n\nRobinson, 21, has never stepped foot inside Wembley, not as a player or spectator. Carter-Vickers, who will turn 21 on New Year\u2019s Eve, has been there in uniform for Tottenham Hotspur a few times, though he has not entered a match.\n\nWith a 27-man roster and two matches on this U.S. tour \u2014 the Americans will test Italy next Tuesday in Belgium \u2014 there are no guarantees the British Americans will start or enter the first friendly as subs. Robinson\u2019s status for Thursday was thrown into serious doubt Tuesday morning when he rolled his ankle in training.\n\nBoth, however, have been in the mix for much of 2018 under interim coach Dave Sarachan, who was tasked with putting the program\u2019s pieces back together.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to do what we feel is necessary in terms of the lineup, but if there\u2019s a way to get them included, that would be a good thing for them,\u201d he said. \" I know how special that would be.\"\n\nCarter-Vickers, a brawny center back, is employed by Tottenham but has been on loan this season with American-owned Swansea City, a second-flight club. (He has started twice.) Previous loans took him to Sheffield United and Ipswich Town.\n\nLikewise, Robinson, a left back, is contracted by Everton but on assignment with second-tier Wigan Athletic; last season, he was with Bolton Wanderers.\n\nCarter-Vickers is originally from Southend, 42 miles east of London. Robinson was born in Milton Keynes, 55 miles northwest of the capital.\n\nBoth will have large delegations at Wembley.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to see how many tickets I can get,\u201d Carter-Vickers said, mentioning 15 as a possibility. \u201cIf I get more, I am sure I can find someone to take them.\u201d\n\nRobinson said, \u201cIt\u2019s not very often I play so locally for the U.S. and especially against England. It\u2019s a big occasion. Everyone in England looks forward to a trip to Wembley, so the fact I can give all my friends and family that, it means a lot to me.\u201d\n\nCarter-Vickers takes the names of both parents, who never married. His father, Howard Carter, is fourth on LSU basketball\u2019s career scoring list; he scored one more point than Shaquille O\u2019Neal. Until 10 years ago, he was the program\u2019s all-time leader in minutes played.\n\nAs a sophomore in 1980-81, he averaged 16 points and helped the Tigers reach the Final Four for the first time in 28 years. In 1983, the Denver Nuggets selected him in the first round of the NBA draft (15th overall). After two years in the league, he took his career to Europe, where he met Cameron\u2019s mother, Geraldine Vickers.\n\nDespite the distance \u2014 he in Britain, Howard in Louisiana \u2014 father and son are close. Howard attended the U.S. match against Paraguay in Cary, N.C., in March and Cameron visits Louisiana annually to see Howard and extended family.\n\nCarter-Vickers is no stranger to the U.S. program; he has been involved with youth national teams since 2014 and was a member of the squad at the 2015 Under-20 World Cup in New Zealand. He has played against England at the junior level.\n\nAs for Thursday\u2019s high-profile encounter: \u201cI\u2019m really looking forward to it. Hopefully I get to play. For my family and stuff like that, it\u2019s a big game.\u201d\n\nRobinson made his U.S. debut in 2014 with the under-18 squad and, amid injuries and an evolving club career, did not return until Sarachan summoned him this past spring.\n\nHis U.S. ties go back two generations, and his father, Marlon, was born in England but grew up in White Plains, N.Y., before starring in soccer at Duke University. In 1982, the Blue Devils advanced to the NCAA final before losing to Indiana in eight overtimes. He became a U.S. citizen.\n\nAntonee, now a big Duke Blue Devils basketball fan, grew up in Liverpool and embraced soccer through the city\u2019s blue team, Everton. (City rival Liverpool is red.)\n\nAfter excelling with Everton\u2019s under-23 squad, Robinson embraced loans to Bolton (26 starts last season) and Wigan, where he has started 15 of 17 league matches this season.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d definitely say when I was younger I had a feeling I would be playing for England one day,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cObviously, now I am playing for the U.S. I am delighted with it.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nNot all the USMNT players have arrived in London yet, but Christian Pulisic is here\n\nHow 140 American soccer players abroad fared this weekend\n\nU.S. national teams check-in: Women ready for title defense; men ready for new coach", "In this photograph taken Aug. 28, 2018, sewer water flows in the back as Rohingya refugees cross a makeshift bamboo bridge at Kutupalong refugee camp, Bangladesh.

The assault was the bloodiest on French soil since World War II, and it shook the nation to its core.\n\nTo that end, Tuesday was supposed to be a solemn day in France, with a commemoration ceremony planned in Paris and somber statements of remembrance issued by public officials. Hundreds gathered outside the concert hall in a lively neighborhood on the eastern side of Paris, and Interior Minister Christophe Castaner, visited the cafes that were targeted in the area.\n\n\u201cThree years have passed but nothing is forgotten,\u201d Macron said in a statement, posted on Twitter. \u201cNovember 13 has entered into the memory of our entire nation, where each of the victims is held.

He then began discussing trade imbalances, targeting French wine in particular.\n\n[Analysis: The Broken Bromance?

Sinema, a three-term congresswoman, overcame attacks on her more liberal record as an Arizona state legislator and committed to a bipartisan approach in a race that hinged on issues such as health care and illegal immigration. Her defeat of McSally will make her the first female senator in Arizona\u2019s history.\n\nMcSally quickly and graciously conceded, preserving her reputation and chances to replace Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.), who was appointed to fill temporarily the seat of the late Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.):\n\nThe race was notable on multiple levels.\n\nFirst, what was a reliable red state is now very much in play for Democrats in 2020. While Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey won reelection, Democrats snagged the Senate seat and flipped Arizona\u2019s 2nd Congressional District. Look for Arizona to become a battleground state in 2020. More generally, the West and Southwest (Nevada, Arizona, California, Oregon, Washington, New Mexico) are safely or trending Democratic. Coupled with Democratic wins in the Rust Belt and Upper Midwest, Republicans outside the South are finding it tough going. That should be worrisome for Senate Republicans on the ballot in 2020 from Maine, Colorado, North Carolina and Arizona \u2014 and for Trump in trying to put together 270 electoral college votes in 2020.\n\nSecond, while the National Republican Senatorial Committee\u2019s conduct in casting doubt on the vote-counting process was reprehensible, Ducey, Cindy McCain and McSally behaved appropriately, refusing to join in the anti-democratic process of delegitimizing elections that don\u2019t go their way. As a result, there will be no reasonable doubt as to the legitimacy of Sinema\u2019s victory \u2014 or of McSally\u2019s political viability going forward.\n\nThird, the Democrats\u2019 win reveals just how miserably Republicans performed in a year in which Democrats held on to or flipped Senate seats in seven states that Trump won in 2016 (Montana, Arizona, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania). Republicans, with the most favorable map in a generation, will pick up at most two seats (depending on the outcome in Florida). Trump might have helped Republicans hold on to the deepest-red states (e.g. Missouri, North Dakota), but his dominating presence in the last week or so of the campaign hammering an anti-immigrant message might have harmed House and Senate Republicans everywhere else. (As of this writing, Democrats picked up at least 32 seats; that total could reach 40. They also added at least seven governorships.)\n\nFourth, how McSally lost is as important as the loss itself. The Post reports, \u201cMcSally lost the race after abandoning the moderate profile she had nurtured in her 2014 congressional race and allying herself with Trump. The former Air Force combat pilot adopted an aggressive tone, accusing Sinema of supporting treason over her 2003 remark that it was \u2018fine\u2019 if a radio host who was asking her a question joined the Taliban.\u201d The lesson here for Republicans should be that unless you are in deep-red states, waving the bloody flag on immigration is a loser.\n\nFifth, exits polls in the race showed Sinema hung on to a high percentage of white voters (44 percent) and won big with Hispanics (69 percent), white college graduates (53 percent), white college-educated women (55 percent), voters 18 to 44 years old (59 percent), and voters who ranked health care as the most important issue (77 percent). That sort of coalition succeeded for Democrats in a previously red state \u2014 and in races all across the country. When looking at presidential candidate, Democratic primary voters should consider who has the ability to put together that kind of coalition.\n\nIn sum, a week after the midterms, the Democrats\u2019 wins look more impressive \u2014 and the GOP looks more like a party in decline. Republicans outside the Deep South should be concerned about their survival so long as Trump is president.\n\nRead more:\n\nKaren Tumulty: This state will be the clearest test of Trump\u2019s dire immigration rhetoric\n\nJennifer Rubin: How to lose in 2020 if you are a Republican\n\nRuy Teixeira: The midterms gave Democrats clear marching orders for 2020\n\nJennifer Rubin: Three options for conscientious Republicans (or ex-Republicans)", "This undated photo provided by the Greek Ministry of Culture on Tuesday, Nov. 13, 2018, shows remains of walls and floors, probably from houses, from the lost ancient city of Tenea.

That was unusual, as the ancient Greeks typically buried their dead in organized cemeteries outside the city walls.\n\nLead archaeologist Elena Korka, who has been excavating in the area since 2013, told The Associated Press that her team had only been digging in the rich cemeteries surrounding Tenea until this year. In one, antiquities smugglers dug up two remarkable 6th century B.C. marble statues of young men in 2010 and tried to sell them for 10 million euros.\n\n\u201cThis year we excavated part of the city itself,\u201d Korka said.\n\nExcavation work continues on the cemeteries, located near the modern village of Hiliomodi about 100 kilometers (60 miles) southwest of Athens.\n\nArchaeologists discovered nine burials there this year, finding gold, copper and bone jewelry, pottery and coins dating from the 4th century B.C. to Roman times.\n\n\u201cThe citizens seem to have been remarkably affluent,\u201d Korka said, adding that the city probably did well out of trade, standing on a key route between the major cities of Corinth and Argos in the northeastern Peloponnese.\n\nSo far, not much was known about Tenea, apart from ancient references to the reputed link with Troy and to its citizens having formed the bulk of the Greek colonists who founded the city of Syracuse in Sicily.\n\nKorka said more should emerge during the excavations, which will continue over coming years.\n\n\u201c(The city) had distinctive pottery shapes with eastern influences, maintained contacts with both east and west ... and had its own way of thinking, which, to the extent that it could, shaped its own policies,\u201d she said.\n\nTenea survived the Roman destruction of neighboring Corinth in 146 B.C., and flourished under Roman rule. It appears to have suffered damage during a Gothic invasion in the late 4th century A.D. and may have been abandoned around the time of Slavic incursions two centuries later.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

What kind of Republican is she?\n\nNow contrast that with the behavior of Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R), who if history is any guide is almost certain to win his Senate race against incumbent Bill Nelson, and of President Trump. I say that Scott is almost certain to win because recounts like the one currently underway in Florida seldom change the results. (Scott led Nelson by 12,562 votes before the recount began.) Yet Scott has been doing everything he can to discredit the electoral process, seemingly trying to convince his supporters that the entire system is corrupt and therefore the only legitimate result is if he is declared the victor even before all the votes are counted. Here\u2019s what\u2019s going on:\n\nRepublicans are sowing skepticism about the electoral process in states with votes that are too close to call, echoing President Trump\u2019s unsubstantiated allegations of voter fraud and suggesting that election officials should jettison the common practice of completing vote counts after Election Day. Nowhere is the effort more aggressive than in Florida, where Gov. Rick Scott is tapping the powers of his administration to defend his slender lead in the U.S. Senate race and accusing Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson of \u201ctrying to steal an election.\u201d Without evidence, Trump on Twitter claimed ballots were \u201cmassively infected\u201d in Florida and said the recount should halt \u2014 though it is mandated by state law and overseas military ballots aren\u2019t due until Friday. \u2026 Scott has called on state law enforcement to investigate heavily Democratic Broward and Palm Beach counties, citing potential vote-counting confusion but providing no evidence of outright fraud. Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, a fellow Republican, echoed the governor\u2019s request and argued that state law enforcement has a \u201cduty\u201d to investigate. Scott also has ordered sheriffs around the state to police the recounts and has filed lawsuits to try to force Broward and Palm Beach counties to essentially treat their elections offices as crime scenes.\n\nAnyone infected with the virus of bothsides-ism will immediately respond, \u201cHey, isn\u2019t Stacey Abrams refusing to concede in Georgia?\u201d Indeed she is, and has filed a lawsuit over the vote counting. Her position is simply that every vote should be counted, while her opponent Brian Kemp not only wants to be declared the winner before the counting is finished, but has spent the time since the election lobbing insults at Abrams. Kemp, who just so happened to oversee the election as secretary of state, instituted a long series of vote suppression efforts seemingly targeted at minority voters (purging the voter rolls, putting tens of thousands of registrations \u201con hold\u201d for minor discrepancies in forms) culminating in an outrageous and baseless accusation two days before the election that Democrats were attempting to hack the state\u2019s computer systems.\n\nBaseless accusations seem to be the order of the day from the Republicans, which is all the more striking because they\u2019re probably going to win these races. They\u2019re ahead in the results being recounted in Florida, and it looks unlikely (if still possible) that Abrams will garner enough votes to force a runoff with Kemp.\n\nSo why can\u2019t they just let the process play itself out? Why do they insist on throwing around unfounded charges and sowing chaos even in races they\u2019re likely to win? Here\u2019s a clue from the New York Times:\n\nThe Republicans\u2019 strategy in Florida reflects their experience in the 2000 presidential recount in the state. Party strategists and lawyers say they prevailed largely because they approached it as they did the race itself, with legal, political and public relations components that allowed them to outmaneuver the Democrats, who were less strategic and consistent with their lawsuit targets and public remarks about the recount.\n\nThat\u2019s a polite way to put it. A better way to put it is that when the 2000 election was thrown into chaos in Florida, Democrats operated under the mistaken belief that there was an orderly process to be undertaken and eventually it would all get sorted out fairly. Meanwhile, Republicans were all but crawling through the Okefenokee with knives in their teeth. Republicans knew that there were no rules that needed to be obeyed and no niceties that needed to be considered. All that mattered was winning, and the winner would be the one who was more ruthless and determined.\n\nThat was how they won in 2000, and that\u2019s what they\u2019ve been doing ever since. To be sure, there are certainly some Republicans who care about things like the integrity of American institutions. But if you were to warn the most important members of their party, like Trump and Scott, that they\u2019re damaging the legitimacy of the system with their reckless words and actions, they would laugh in your face. Worrying about that stuff is for losers. If there\u2019s even a one percent chance that a recount (or just a count) could work out in the other side\u2019s favor, then no tactic is too unethical, no accusation too slanderous, no approach too cynical to prevent it from happening. If they have to burn it all down in order to win, that\u2019s what they\u2019ll do.\n\nAll these impulses were present in the GOP before, but Trump has only made them worse. And as Rick Hasen warns, if the presidential election is close in 2020 and the Democrat comes out on top, there\u2019s no telling what means Trump will employ to convince his supporters that the process was illegitimate, or how they\u2019ll respond in their disappointment and rage. All the bile and hatred that have poured out of the White House for the past two years, and the effect that this has had, could turn out to be just a preview of what\u2019s to come.\n\nRead more:\n\nJennifer Rubin: What Democrats\u2019 big win in Arizona means\n\nCarter Eskew: The Florida fraud redux\n\nGreg Sargent: Trump\u2019s authoritarian response to Florida shenanigans hints at worse to come\n\nDana Chisnell and Whitney Quesenbery: How a badly designed ballot might have swayed the election in Florida", "Journalists and supporters of Lebanese Prime Minister--designate Saad Hariri, left, clap as he arrives for a press conference, in Beirut, Lebanon, Tuesday, Nov. 13, 2018.

He said the Shiite militant group bears full responsibility for the consequences, including Lebanon\u2019s flagging economy.\n\nHariri stopped short of resigning, however, saying there was still an opportunity to bridge the differences.\n\nHariri, the top Sunni Muslim leader in the country, is coming under increasing pressure from the Iranian-backed Shiite Hezbollah, which insists that six Sunni legislators allied with Hezbollah be represented in the new Cabinet. Hariri flatly rejects the demand, saying the six independent legislators are not part of a parliamentary bloc and are therefore not entitled to have a minister in the cabinet.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that government formation has hit a big obstacle,\u201d Hariri said.\n\nLebanon held its first parliamentary elections in nine years in May but political bickering over the distribution has stood in the way of government formation.\n\nGiving Hariri\u2019s Sunni opponents a Cabinet seat is the latest delay in the formation after months of negotiations gave the right-wing Christian Lebanese Forces four cabinet seats, including that of deputy prime minister. Hezbollah will likely get three seats, the biggest number of ministers ever for the group, including the health ministry.\n\nSome analysts link Hezbollah\u2019s insistence on representing the independent Sunni legislators in the Cabinet to a new wave of U.S. sanctions against its patron Iran that went into effect on Nov 5.\n\nHariri insisted however that the obstacles were not linked to external politics.\n\nFurther delays in the government are increasing pressure on the country\u2019s struggling economy and endanger international donors\u2019 pledges of $11 billion in loans and grants to help debt-ridden Lebanon. Those projects that were agreed on during a conference in Paris in April as well as reforms to unlock those loans will have to be carried out by the new government in Lebanon.\n\nLebanon has the third largest debt in the world of about $85 billion or 155 percent of the gross domestic product. The economy is also suffering from high unemployment and little growth.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Zimbabweans have reacted with stunned disbelief to the testimony from two generals who denied troops killed six people in August when the military was called in to crush protests following the country\u2019s disputed elections. (Mujahid Safodien, File/Associated Press)\n\nHARARE, Zimbabwe \u2014 Zimbabweans have reacted with stunned disbelief to the testimony by two generals who denied troops killed six people in August when the military was called in to crush protests following the country\u2019s disputed elections.\n\nThe generals suggested that Zimbabwe\u2019s opposition was responsible for the killings.\n\nZimbabweans and opposition leaders on Tuesday expressed outrage at the denials and the lack of a serious investigation by police into the killings.\n\nOn August 1, armed soldiers were deployed in the capital, Harare, to suppress a protest against delays in announcing results of the country\u2019s first elections without former ruler Robert Mugabe. Gunfire erupted and six people died. Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa set up a commission of inquiry, headed by former South African president Kgalema Motlanthe, to probe the killings.\n\nDespite widely published photos and video showing the Zimbabwean army soldiers firing on people in Harare\u2019s streets, the generals said under oath that they do not believe the troops shot at people.\n\n\u201cI do not believe that any of the soldiers fired. Yes, they fired in the air, but I do not believe any could have aimed shots at the civilians. I have no reason to believe that one of the soldiers could have shot and killed those people,\u201d said Zimbabwe Defense Forces Commander Gen. Philip Valerio Sibanda, during the nationally televised hearing.\n\nThe tactical commander of the military unit, Gen. Anselem Sanyatwe, told the commission he suspected \u201cmilitant\u201d opposition activists who deserted from the army could have shot at protesters, a claim repeated by Sibanda.\n\nWhen presented with a photo of a kneeling soldier who appeared to be aiming at protesters, Sanyatwe said the man \u201ctook that position because he was avoiding missiles that were being thrown at him.\u201d\n\nSome inquiry commissioners and people in the public gallery were visibly stunned by the generals\u2019 denials.\n\n\u201cIs that your evidence?\u201d asked Lovemore Madhuku, one of the commissioners, adding that evidence by other witnesses showed that the shootings coincided with the military\u2019s deployment.\n\nSibanda countered that he had \u201cheard gunfire well before the troops deployed.\u201d\n\nMotlanthe said the generals\u2019 denials contradicted evidence so far received by the commission from other witnesses who include victims.\n\nPolice testified that they have not turned up information that would determine who killed the civilians. The police have not retrieved any cartridges from the city center where the shooting took place, do not have any suspects and have not made any arrests, said Police Detective Chief Inspector Edmore Runganga, who is leading investigations into the Aug. 1 killings.\n\nCrisis in Zimbabwe Coalition, a local non-governmental organization on Tuesday said it is \u201cperturbed by the misleading evidence presented by top army and police officers. ... We note an apparent attempt to blame the opposition, business and ordinary citizens for the shootings and this will likely lead to a witch-hunt that will see continued persecution of hundreds of activists that were arrested in the aftermath of the killings,\u201d said the organization in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe army did not shoot at anyone, like seriously? This is all turning into a circus,\u201d Ethel Sambiri, a Harare resident told The Associated Press on Tuesday.\n\nDavid Coltart, an opposition member of parliament, tweeted Tuesday: \u201cThe commission of inquiry into the 1st August shootings in Harare took a farcical turn yesterday. People were killed with bullets fired by soldiers and witnessed by tens of foreign journalists. Now the military deny they killed the people but the truth is plain to see.\u201d\n\nMain opposition MDC party spokesman Jacob Mafume expressed doubt that the inquiry would lead to the truth.\n\n\u201cThis just confirms our previously stated position that this commission of inquiry is a farce, a process meant to cleanse the army and put blame on the opposition,\u201d said Mafume. \u201cWe are not taking it seriously.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)\n\nFood reporter/columnist\n\nWhen I was a boy in Omaha, my parents used to take the family to dinner in a supermarket. The place was an honest-to-God restaurant inside the grocery store, a full-service operation with a host stand and booths and a menu that you could hold in your grimy little kid hands. I remember next to nothing about the food, except that the kitchen griddled up a good burger. Of course, back then, I thought any burger was a good burger.\n\nWhat I remember most about the restaurant was its design: It had no street entrance. To reach the host stand, you had to walk through the grocery store, with its florescent, interrogation-bright lights. It was sober lighting for the sober task of inspecting the meats, vegetables and boxes of Fruity Pebbles necessary for a growing family. (Hey, the cereal was necessary to me!)\n\nOnce you safely navigated past the prison-guard floodlights of the supermarket, however, you could retreat to the relative shadows of the restaurant itself. Even this modest eatery, positioned near the refrigerator chill of the dairy section, understood the benefits of mood lighting: It allowed you to release your tight grip on life and indulge.\n\n[The 10 best bargain restaurants in the D.C. suburbs]\n\nDining in supermarkets has changed significantly since the 1970s. The international menus available these days are far removed from my white-bread Midwestern youth. I\u2019ve been spending a lot of time in Whole Foods Markets lately, and not because of the distant-cousin relationship between my employer and America\u2019s favorite organic punching bag. Amazon bought Whole Foods last year, and the tech giant\u2019s founder and chief executive, Jeffrey P. Bezos, owns The Washington Post, in case you haven\u2019t read that 10,000 times already in this paper.\n\nNo, I\u2019ve been visiting Whole Foods stores because they\u2019ve become as much dining rooms as grocery stores. You can buy ramen, sushi, tacos, bubble tea, barbecue, Peruvian chicken, Neapolitan-style pizza, craft beers, wine, steamed buns and so much more inside these super-snob-markets. The stores even have places for you to sit, as long as you don\u2019t mind dining in spaces that overlook grocery aisles or stare out onto suburban streets or seem like cut-rate sports bars that, simultaneously, are too good to serve Buffalo chicken tenders.\n\nYou might notice that some dishes are conspicuously missing from my list, such as the smoked pork shoulder ramen from Paper Horse, chef Erik Bruner-Yang\u2019s part-Chinese, part-Japanese concept at the Whole Foods stores on H Street NE and in Foggy Bottom. That\u2019s because the noodle soup can\u2019t begin to compare to Bruner-Yang\u2019s best work at Toki Underground, back when he was still building bowls there during the shop\u2019s heyday. The pork buried in this Whole Foods ramen is chewy and charred, not the luscious, soy-and-sake braised slices of chashu that melt in your mouth. I also couldn\u2019t detect any smoke flavor.\n\nNor did I include pizza, even though several stores produce fine pies, particularly the Tenleytown location (4530 40th St. NW, 202-237-5800), where I love the cheese slices \u2014 oversize triangles sauced with San Marzano tomatoes, then cooked in a Wood Stone oven till nice and crispy. Pizza just seems too obvious to feature on this list.\n\n5. Baby rack ribs, $8.99 for a half rack and $17 for a full, at the Fair Lakes Whole Foods (4501 Market Commons Dr., Fairfax, Va., 703-222-2058). Years ago, this location had a robust barbecue menu, including brisket that, while poorly trimmed, was smoky and succulent. You can still order baby backs at the Sports Spot, a section of the supermarket that serves as a communal space for those who want to watch manly games on TV. The ribs are dry-rubbed, smoked for several hours and then reconstituted on the grill for an extra layer of char. They\u2019re not fresh from the smoker, but they\u2019re plenty tasty.\n\n4. Peruvian chicken, $8 for a quarter and $10 for a half, at the Arlington Whole Foods (2700 Wilson Blvd., Arlington, Va., 703-527-6596). The half chicken I ordered here looked as if its ancestral home were New Orleans, not Peru. The skin was almost blackened, like some evolutionary land-based relative to Paul Prudhomme\u2019s blackened redfish. Yet, under that layer of carbonized char, there lay juicy bird meat, light on seasonings but smoky and tender. When dipped in the bright, herbal green sauce, the chicken found its full voice, a Peruvian folk song sung by a choir.\n\n3. Taco bowl, $8, at the Riverdale Park Whole Foods (6621-B Baltimore Ave., Riverdale Park, Md., 240-487-7575). Every Saturday, from about 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., this store sets up a small station, where you can build your own taco bowl, starting with a fat, puffy flour shell, fried in-house. The key is not to pile on the ingredients, but to choose them wisely. Skip the rice, which has no place in this dish, and tell your builder to go easy on the sour cream or else your lunch will quickly turn into taco bowl soup. And that\u2019s no good.\n\n2. Double cheeseburger, $7, at the Silver Spring Whole Foods (833 Wayne Ave., Silver Spring, Md., 301-608-9373). When you punch in your order at the Burger Bar in Silver Spring, the touch screen will not ask for your preferred degree of doneness. Which blows, right? I mean, who wants a double stack, made with quality, 80-percent-lean ground beef, and then have the patties incinerated to medium-well? The trick is to flag the griddle man after you\u2019ve ordered, who will happily cook your burger to a desired temp. Should you forget, though, there\u2019s still plenty of beef flavor hiding in this burger, even when most of the fat has been rendered out.\n\n\n\nMya Allen tops a cheesesteak with pickled onions at Philly Wing Fry. (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)\n\n1. Philly cheesesteak, $12 for a seven-inch sandwich and $16 for a 10-inch, at the South Capitol Hill Whole Foods (101 H St. SE, 202-469-7280). In October, Kith and Kin chef Kwame Onwuachi debuted Philly Wing Fry, a fast-casual fever dream featuring three of his favorite foods: Philly cheesesteaks, chicken wings and waffle fries. If you order all three at once, you\u2019re either really stoned or trying to win a bet. The cheesesteak alone is rich enough to stop time. Built with Roseda Farms rib-eye that is dry-aged at least 50 days, the cheesesteak has that blue-cheese funk common to such beef. The meat is then slipped into a roll toasted in dry-age beef fat and topped with smoked provolone, roasted garlic mayo, pickled pearl onions and caramelized onions. If a traditional Philly cheesesteak is heavy, then this is a collapsed sun sucking matter from all corners of the universe. There\u2019s no reason for this sandwich to exist, but I\u2019m so glad it does.", "CNN sued the Trump administration on behalf of reporter Jim Acosta on Tuesday, asking a court to restore Acosta\u2019s White House press pass after President Trump suspended it last week.\n\nThe unusual lawsuit, an escalation of Trump\u2019s long-\n\nrunning war of words with CNN, seeks a judge\u2019s intervention after Trump banished Acosta from the White House grounds for an indefinite period after a brief altercation between Acosta and a White House press aide.\n\nAfter a testy exchange between the president and the reporter, the unidentified press aide went up to Acosta to take a microphone out of his hands. As a result, press secretary Sarah Sanders announced a few hours later that the White House had revoked Acosta\u2019s \u201chard pass,\u201d which enables reporters to enter and leave the grounds each day.\n\nSanders called Acosta\u2019s alleged behavior \u201cunacceptable\u201d and cited Acosta\u2019s encounter with the press aide as the basis for yanking his credential. She tweeted an apparently doctored video of the incident.\n\nCNN filed suit in U.S. District Court in Washington. \u201cWe have asked this court for an immediate restraining order requiring the pass be returned to Jim, and will seek permanent relief as part of this process,\u201d the network said in a statement released Tuesday morning.\n\n[Read the CNN lawsuit against the Trump administration]\n\nLate Tuesday afternoon, the judge in the case, Timothy J. Kelly, ordered the White House and the other defendants to respond to CNN\u2019s motion for a temporary restraining order by 11 a.m. Wednesday. He set a hearing on the restraining order \u2014 which would temporarily restore Acosta\u2019s press credential, pending the outcome of a trial \u2014 for 3 p.m. Wednesday.\n\nLegal experts say the network\u2019s chances of winning in court are favorable. Although a court would probably give the president and Secret Service the benefit of the doubt if they barred a reporter due to security threats, the First Amendment protects journalists against arbitrary restrictions by government officials.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a really strong lawsuit,\u201d Floyd Abrams, a noted First Amendment lawyer, told CNN on Sunday. \u201cI think [CNN] should sue, and if it\u2019s not about Acosta, this is going to happen again . . . So whether it\u2019s CNN suing or the next company suing, someone\u2019s going to have to bring a lawsuit, and whoever does is going to win\u201d unless the White House can show that Acosta is violent and disruptive.\n\nThe suit names CNN and Acosta as plaintiffs. Trump, Chief of Staff John F. Kelly, Deputy Chief of Staff for Communications Bill Shine, Sanders and the U.S. Secret Service are named as defendants. It alleges a violation of the First Amendment, a violation of the Fifth Amendment, which guarantees due process in government actions, and a violation of the Administrative Procedure Act. It asks for the immediate restoration of Acosta\u2019s credential, or restoration pending a hearing before a \u201cneutral\u201d arbiter.\n\nIn a defiant statement, Sanders called the suit \u201cmore grandstanding from CNN\u201d and said the White House will \u201cvigorously\u201d defend itself.\n\n\u201cCNN, who has nearly 50 additional hard pass holders, and Mr. Acosta is no more or less special than any other media outlet or reporter with respect to the First Amendment,\u201d she said.\n\nShe made no mention of a physical altercation between Acosta and the press aide \u2014 the original reason the White House cited for the suspension \u2014 and instead said the suspension was because Acosta would not yield to other reporters.\n\n\u201cAfter Mr. Acosta asked the president two questions \u2014 each of which the president answered \u2014 he physically refused to surrender a White House microphone to an intern, so that other reporters might ask their questions,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cThis was not the first time this reporter has inappropriately refused to yield to other reporters . . . The First Amendment is not served when a single reporter, of more than 150 present, attempts to monopolize the floor.\u201d\n\nDisputes have occasionally flared over which members of the press corps are qualified to receive a \u201chard pass.\u201d But Trump\u2019s action appears to be unprecedented; there\u2019s no record of a president revoking such a pass from a reporter because he didn\u2019t like the questions the reporter asked.\n\nDuring Lyndon Johnson\u2019s presidency, the Secret Service denied a credential to reporter Robert Sherrill of the Nation magazine. The agency said Sherrill, who had been in a fistfight with one of Johnson\u2019s campaign aides, was a physical threat to the president. Sherrill sued and eventually won in 1977, though he declined to apply for a pass afterward, according to journalist George Condon.\n\nAnother possible parallel: A federal judge last year struck down Trump\u2019s blocking of critics on Twitter. She ruled that the First Amendment prevented him from denying access to presidential statements due to a would-be follower\u2019s opinions and views.\n\nThe same principle applies in the Acosta case, said Jameel Jaffer, executive director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, which brought the Twitter suit last year.\n\n\u201cThe government cannot exclude reporters from [the White House] because of their views,\u201d said Jaffer. \u201cOnce the government created a general right of access it cannot selectively withdraw it based on viewpoint. Viewpoint is not a criterion that establishes a media organization\u2019s right to be at a news briefing.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s lawsuit, he added, \u201cis critical to preserve the media\u2019s ability to ask hard questions and hold the government accountable . . . It would be intolerable to let this kind of thing go unchallenged. Other reporters would end up hesitating before asking sharp questions, the White House would be able to use the threat of similar revocations for critical coverage, and media coverage of the White House would be distorted because of fear of official retaliation.\u201d\n\nOther journalists have been widely supportive of Acosta since Trump pushed him out last week. In a statement Tuesday, the White House Correspondents' Association\u2019s president, Olivier Knox, said the organization \u201cstrongly supports\u201d CNN in regaining its access. He said the revocation of Acosta\u2019s credential was a \u201cdisproportionate reaction\u201d to the news conference incident. \u201cThe president of the United States should not be in the business of arbitrarily picking the men and women who cover him,\u201d Knox said.\n\nOthers have urged even stronger action in response to Trump\u2019s retaliation against Acosta.\n\nRichard Tofel, the president of ProPublica, the nonprofit investigative news organization, suggested in an interview that journalists band together and walk out of the White House press room.\n\n\u201cIf favorable coverage is the price of operating within the [White House] gates, then we can cover it from outside the gates,\u201d said Tofel, a lawyer who was once an intern in the White House press office. \u201cI think that, as a matter of press freedom, the press corps in the room should say, \u2018If you\u2019ve redefined the rules to hand out passes only to those whose coverage you don\u2019t object to, we\u2019re all leaving.\u2019 This isn\u2019t principally a legal question. It\u2019s a question of editorial independence.\u201d\n\nDeanna Paul contributed to this report.", "MOSCOW \u2014 Russia\u2019s Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev says Moscow will boycott the annual World Economic Forum in the Swiss ski resort of Davos if it fails to lift restrictions on the attendance of Russian businessmen.\n\nOrganizers of the WEF, which takes place every January, have reportedly warned Russian billionaire tycoons Oleg Deripaska and Viktor Vekselberg, and head of the state-controlled VTB bank Andrei Kostin that they\u2019re not welcome.

(Justin Lane/EPA-EFE/Rex)\n\n-- Ocasio-Cortez, who at 29 just became the youngest woman ever elected to Congress, has joined the Progressive Caucus and appeared at a news conference on the sidelines of the orientation session. She spoke critically of Pelosi during the campaign but declined to say how she\u2019ll vote in the leadership races. Last week, Ocasio-Cortez made headlines when she said she cannot afford to pay rent for an apartment in the District until her government salary kicks in come January.

Deb Haaland in Albuquerque will be one of the first Native American women in Congress.\n\n-- With this fresh crop of new faces, the Progressive Caucus has ambitious plans to take on a much bigger public profile. Its PAC raised $300,000 last year \u2014 and $1.8 million this year. Last month, the group launched a center to improve coordination with liberal outside groups. There are plans to raise money to hire and place full-time fellows in congressional offices. The group even paid last month for the first time to conduct a national poll to help shape its messaging. Another extensive poll is planned for January. \u201cWe want people to know this isn't your mother or father's Progressive Caucus,\u201d said Pocan.\n\n-- The sheer size of the Progressive Caucus will make it harder for them to stick together than it has been for the Freedom Caucus. But Republicans have also learned over the past two years that it\u2019s much easier to stay united when there\u2019s a president of the opposite party. Barack Obama kept the factions of the GOP together most of the time.

But the Democratic leadership votes won\u2019t take place until after Thanksgiving. Two weeks is an eternity during these kinds of fights because they play out largely behind the scenes and can involve Machiavellian machinations.\n\nNo one has stepped forward to challenge either Pelosi for speaker or Hoyer (Md.) for majority leader. Clyburn, of South Carolina, is facing a challenge from Diana DeGette of Denver for the No. 3 spot of majority whip.\n\nThere are other competitive races, as well, though they may turn less on ideology than personality.

None are members of the Progressive Caucus.\n\n-- For her part, Pelosi still hasn\u2019t locked down the votes to regain the speaker\u2019s gavel, but every pillar of the Democratic establishment is falling in line to make sure they maintain their seats at the table in her office. Emily\u2019s List is calling the women they just got elected to tout Pelosi\u2019s record as a feminist who delivers results. The presidents of the AFSCME, AFT and AFL-CIO unions each issued public endorsements of Pelosi. The pro-LGBT Human Rights Campaign said, \u201cWe need her leadership now more than ever.\u201d The League of Conservation Voters called her \u201cthe most pro-environment Speaker of the House in our nation\u2019s history.\u201d And incoming committee chairs, from Elijah Cummings on Oversight to Richie Neal on Ways and Means, are sending \u201cDear Colleagues\u201d letters that insist a leadership fight for the top spot would be self-defeating.\n\n-- \u201cPelosi is expected to easily win an internal party nomination vote scheduled for the end of the month, but she would then need to win a majority of the House in a January floor vote to become speaker,\u201d Mike DeBonis and Elise Viebeck report. \u201cAt least eight sitting members have signaled they will not vote for her in that scenario, and at least four incoming freshmen have said the same \u2014 such as Rep.-elect Max Rose (D-N.Y.), who said Monday he is looking for another candidate to step forward. \u2018I am not voting for her \u2014 no if, ands or buts, under any circumstances,\u2019 Rose told Fox News. A dozen other incoming freshmen have called generally for new leadership without saying specifically that they will oppose Pelosi in a floor vote.\n\n\u201cThe internal resistance to Pelosi will get an initial test Wednesday, when House Democrats meet for the first time since the election and debate a change to party rules, advanced by Pelosi critics, to require a 218-vote majority to win the party\u2019s nomination for speaker.

(Win McNamee/Getty Images)\n\n-- Congress returns today for a lame-duck session that will be dominated by a fight over funding for the border wall. Trump no longer says Mexico will pay for it. Now he wants taxpayers to pick up the tab. \u201cBefore breaking for the election, Congress funded 75 percent of the federal government, including the Pentagon, through Sept. 30. But the portion left undone includes the Department of Homeland Security, whose budget pays for border infrastructure. That money will run out Dec. 7, raising the specter of a partial government shutdown if Congress and Trump can\u2019t reach an agreement in the 12 legislative days before the deadline,\u201d Mike DeBonis and Erica Werner report.\n\n\u201cA fresh complication for any end-of-the-year deal is a Democratic effort to protect the investigation of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III from political interference by the Trump administration. Trump\u2019s decision last week to replace Attorney General Jeff Sessions with a loyalist has prompted new demands from Democrats and a few Republicans to add legislation shielding Mueller to the final spending bills.\u201d\n\n-- These four quotes neatly capture the tension on the Hill as lawmakers fly back today:\n\n\u201cWe need the money to build the wall \u2014 the whole wall, not pieces of it all over,\u201d Trump said during a news conference last week.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to have to be the president who decides whether he\u2019s willing to fight for the funding; the House certainly will,\u201d said Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.).\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s wall or nothing, they\u2019re going to get nothing,\u201d replied Pat Leahy (D-Vt.), the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine, with all the things that we have to do here to wrap up this Congress, that we would revisit immigration,\u201d added Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), \u201cbut who knows?\u201d\n\nWelcome to the Daily 202, PowerPost's morning briefing for decision-makers.\n\nSign up to receive the newsletter.\n\nWHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:\n\nSecretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen visits the DHS Election Operations Center in Arlington, Va., last week. (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)\n\n-- Trump has told advisers he plans to remove Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, possibly as soon as this week. Nick Miroff, Josh Dawsey and Philip Rucker scoop: \u201cTrump canceled a planned trip with Nielsen this week to visit U.S. troops at the border in South Texas and told aides over the weekend that he wants her out as soon as possible ... The president has grumbled for months about what he views as Nielsen\u2019s lackluster performance on immigration enforcement and is believed to be looking for a replacement who will implement his policy ideas with more alacrity. \u2026 Trump has changed his mind on key personnel decisions before, and Chief of Staff John F. Kelly is fighting Nielsen\u2019s pending dismissal and attempting to postpone it, aides say. But Kelly\u2019s future in the administration also is shaky, according to three White House officials.\n\n\u201cNielsen has been reluctant to leave the administration before reaching the one-year mark as secretary on Dec. 6, but she has been unhappy in the job for several months, according to colleagues. \u2026 Nielsen\u2019s departure would leave a leadership void at the government\u2019s third-largest agency, which has 240,000 employees and a $60 billion budget. The deputy secretary job at DHS has been vacant since April, and the White House has not submitted to Congress a nomination for that post. Unless Trump were to name another official to lead DHS in an acting capacity, the day-to-day task of running the agency would fall to Claire M. Grady, the undersecretary for management.\n\n\u201cKris Kobach\u2019s loss in the Kansas governor\u2019s race has generated speculation that Trump could attempt to nominate him as a replacement for Nielsen, but Kobach, Kansas\u2019s secretary of state, remains a polarizing figure whose hard-line views \u2014 especially on immigration \u2014 are considered by many observers to be too extreme to win Senate confirmation.\u201d\n\nThe logo for Amazon is displayed on a screen at the Nasdaq MarketSite in New York.

Jonathan O'Connell, Robert McCartney and Patricia Sullivan report: \u201cAn announcement could come as early as Tuesday \u2026 The choice of Crystal City in Arlington County as one of the winners could cement Northern Virginia\u2019s reputation as a magnet for business and potentially reshape the Washington region into an eastern outpost of Silicon Valley over the next decade. \u2026 The decision hands Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) and local leaders the largest economic-development prize in a generation \u2014 one promising billions of dollars in capital investments alone \u2014 but could also put pressure on the region\u2019s already steep housing prices, congested roads, and yawning divide between wealthy and low-income residents. It also would represent a victory for New York Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) and Gov.

Remington and Michael Cavna)\n\nA CALL IN ARIZONA:\n\n-- Democrat Kyrsten Sinema was declared the winner in Arizona\u2019s Senate race, becoming the state\u2019s first female senator and narrowing Republicans\u2019 Senate majority. Elise Viebeck reports: \u201cNearly a week after Election Day, the Associated Press projected Sinema as the winner on Monday. She had 49.7 percent of the vote to [Republican Martha] McSally\u2019s 48 percent after mail-in and absentee ballots were counted. Of the more than 2.2 million ballots cast, Sinema won by 38,197 votes. She will replace Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) \u2026 It has been 30 years since Democrats held a Senate seat in Arizona. \u2026 It was unclear what will happen to the state\u2019s other Senate seat, which is held by Republican Jon Kyl. Kyl was appointed to replace [the late senator John] McCain and has not committed to serving past this year. It is possible that Republican Gov. Doug Ducey would appoint McSally to the seat.\u201d\n\nBUT OTHER RACES REMAIN UP IN THE AIR:\n\n-- Following Trump\u2019s example, Republicans are sowing mistrust about the electoral process by pursuing unfounded allegations of voter fraud \u2014 most notably in Florida. Beth Reinhard, Sean Sullivan and Amy Gardner report: \u201c[Florida] Gov. Rick Scott is tapping the powers of his administration to defend his slender lead in the U.S. Senate race and accusing Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson of \u2018trying to steal an election.\u2019 \u2026 What appears to be a coordinated Republican strategy to undercut post-election vote counting is also evident in New Mexico, where Rep. Yvette Herrell (R) is refusing to concede her race to Democrat Xochitl Torres Small after absentee ballots changed her status from winner to loser ... \"\n\n-- Nelson called on Scott to recuse himself from overseeing the recount as a Florida judge scolded the politics of the process. Amy Gardner, Felicia Sonmez and Sean Sullivan report: \u201cAs local officials scrambled to meet Thursday\u2019s machine-recount deadline, lawsuits mounted from all sides \u2014 including a complaint by the League of Women Voters and Common Cause Florida seeking to bar Scott from using his position to influence the ballot-counting process. Earlier Monday, a state judge rejected a request from Scott to seize voting machines and ballots in closely watched Broward County, ruling there was no evidence of voter fraud. Meanwhile, Scott pressed forward with plans to travel to Washington this week for orientation activities designed for newly elected senators. \u2018I\u2019m headed to Washington tomorrow to start the process of becoming the next U.S. senator,\u2019 Scott said Monday night in an appearance on Fox News.\u201d\n\n-- Republicans\u2019 stance on the Florida recount is an extension of the campaign intended to bolster GOP morale in an election where the party lost ground. The New York Times\u2019s Jeremy W. Peters and Maggie Haberman report: \u201cThe concerted effort by Republicans in Washington and Florida to discredit the state\u2019s recount as illegitimate and potentially rife with fraud reflects a cold political calculation: Treat the recount as the next phase of a campaign to secure the party\u2019s majority and agenda in the Senate. That imperative \u2014 described by Republican lawyers, strategists and advisers involved in the effort \u2014 reflects the G.O.P.\u2019s determination to tighten its hold on power in the narrowly divided Senate. \u2026 Everyone from donors to rank-and-file lawmakers is determined to keep Democrats from notching another victory.\u201d\n\n-- A federal judge delayed the certification of Georgia\u2019s election results, as Democrat Stacey Abrams holds out hope she might still be able to force a runoff against Republican Brian Kemp. The New York Times\u2019s Alan Blinder reports: \u201cGeorgia\u2019s secretary of state, Robyn A. Crittenden, had been preparing to certify the outcome of the election as soon as Wednesday, one day after Georgia\u2019s 159 counties were to complete their tabulations and six days before state law mandated certification. But in a 56-page ruling on Monday night, Judge Totenberg forbade Ms. Crittenden, who assumed office only last week, from certifying the results until at least Friday evening.\u201d\n\n-- Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) refused to elaborate on her comment about a \u201cpublic hanging\u201d as she faces a runoff next month against Democrat Mike Espy, who is black. Michael Brice-Saddler and Deanna Paul report: \u201cRep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) demanded a public apology \u2014 for all Mississippians \u2014 from [Hyde-Smith], who drew harsh criticism for [the comment] \u2026 Thompson released a statement Monday, calling the senator\u2019s comments on public hanging \u2018beyond disrespectful and offensive,\u2019 adding that Mississippi\u2019s history includes \u2018one of the highest numbers of public lynching, that we know of, than any other state in this country.\u2019 \u2026 \u2018I put out a statement yesterday, and that\u2019s all I\u2019m gonna say about it,\u2019 Hyde-Smith said when asked by reporters if she was familiar with the history of hangings in Mississippi.\u201d\n\n-- California Democrats have won supermajorities in both chambers of the state legislature. The AP\u2019s Don Thompson reports: \u201cDemocrats have won two Republican-held California state Senate seats in the Central Valley \u2026 The victories give Democrats a two-thirds advantage in the 40-member Senate. The party also has that advantage in the 80-seat Assembly. The party also holds every statewide office, led by Gov.-elect Gavin Newsom. Two-thirds majorities allow Democrats to raise taxes, suspend legislative rules and override vetoes without Republican votes.\u201d\n\n-- Democrats\u2019 fortunes look better now than they did on Election Day, as later results have favored them. The AP\u2019s Steve Peoples reports: \u201cThe blue shift alters the trajectory of Trump\u2019s next two years in the White House, breaking up the Republican monopoly in Washington. It also gives Democrats stronger footing in key states ahead of the next presidential race and in the redrawing of congressional districts \u2014 a complicated process that has been dominated by the GOP, which has drawn favorable boundaries for their candidates.\u201d\n\nSen.

The Cleveland Plain Dealer\u2019s Sabrina Eaton reports: \u201cIn an interview with cleveland.com, Brown said that he's heard from an \u2018overwhelming\u2019 number of people who have told him he should think of a presidential run, and that he and his family intend to discuss it over the holidays, when his children and grandchildren will be around. \u2018This will very much be a family decision,\u2019 said Brown. \u2018It would affect a decade of our lives. It is a very personal, serious decision.\u2019 He said he believes the message of worker empowerment that he espoused in this year's re-election should be a blueprint for the national Democrats to win back the White House in 2020 and that he'd be happy if his message is adopted by other Democrats running for president.\u201d\n\n-- The Weekly Standard published an audio recording of Rep.

The Weekly Standard released the recording \u2014 a two-minute audio in which King can be heard bantering with a handful of supporters at the back of an Iowa restaurant during a campaign stop on Nov. 5 ... He talked about pheasant hunting and his \u2018patented pheasant noodle soup\u2019 sprinkled with whole jalape\u00f1o peppers he had grown himself. Around the 1:20 mark, King joked that he\u2019d have to get some \u2018dirt from Mexico\u2019 to grow his next batch of peppers because they didn\u2019t have enough bite.\u201d\n\n-- Rep. Jason Lewis (R-Minn.), who lost his reelection bid in the south suburbs of the Twin Cities, wrote a Wall Street Journal op-ed blaming John McCain\u2019s vote against repealing Obamacare for Republican losses. From Felicia Sonmez: \u201cIn the piece, titled \u2018Who Lost the House? John McCain,\u2019 Lewis makes a novel argument: that McCain\u2019s famous thumbs-down vote last year against a \u2018skinny\u2019 repeal of the Affordable Care Act doomed Republicans by making it more difficult for them to counter Democratic claims that GOP lawmakers would do away with protections for those with preexisting conditions. The catch, of course, is that if Republicans had ultimately succeeded in their efforts to repeal the health-care law, they would have done just that.\u201d\n\n-- In at least three battleground states, Democrats failed to seize control of the statehouses despite winning a majority of the ballots cast for the legislative races. Christopher Ingraham reports: \u201c[G]errymandering is just as much of an issue at the state government level, as the cases of Pennsylvania, Michigan and North Carolina illustrate. In Pennsylvania, Democratic candidates won 54 percent of the statewide House popular vote, but they walked away with 92 seats in the 203-seat state legislature, or 45 percent. \u2026 Michigan Democrats won 200,000 more votes statewide than Republicans did but will get 52 out of 110 seats. North Carolina Democrats prevailed in the popular vote by 79,000 votes but won 54 out of 120 seats.\u201d\n\nJerome Corsi in 2008. The conservative author said that he expects to be indicted by prosecutors working for special counsel Robert S. Mueller III on a charge of lying. (AP)\n\nTHERE\u2019S A BEAR IN THE WOODS:\n\n-- Conservative author Jerome Corsi, who has ties to Trump ally Roger Stone, said he expects to be indicted by special counsel Bob Mueller for lying to investigators. Rosalind S. Helderman, Manuel Roig-Franzia and Carol D. Leonnig report: \u201cCorsi, a writer who has promoted political conspiracy theories, provided research during the White House race to [Stone], who Mueller has been scrutinizing for possible ties to WikiLeaks. On Monday, Corsi told listeners of his daily live-stream Web program that he turned over two computers, emails and other communications to Mueller and sat for six interviews totaling more than 40 hours since receiving a subpoena two months ago. But he said that his cooperation had \u2018exploded\u2019 in recent weeks and that Mueller\u2019s team has said he will be criminally charged. \u2026 In a text message to The Washington Post on Monday, Stone said he has not been contacted by Mueller\u2019s team. He said that his attorneys have \u2018fully reviewed\u2019 his communications with Corsi. \u2026 Appearing on the Infowars website Monday evening, Stone said that \u2018perhaps they have squeezed poor Dr. Corsi to frame me.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- Trump\u2019s former personal attorney Michael Cohen arrived in Washington. ABC News\u2019s Shannon K. Crawford and Luke Barr report: \u201cThe purpose of Cohen\u2019s travel is unclear, and Cohen declined to answer any questions from ABC News about why he was there. Cohen has previously participated in multiple interview sessions totaling more than 40 hours with investigators from [Mueller\u2019s office] in Washington, D.C., and federal prosecutors in New York City.\u201d\n\n-- Top congressional Democrats are demanding to know whether the Justice Department\u2019s ethics chief advised acting attorney general Matt Whitaker to recuse himself from Mueller\u2019s probe. Karoun Demirjian reports: \u201cIn their letter, seven leading Democrats ask ethics chief Lee Lofthus to tell them \u2018immediately\u2019 whether he or others advised Whitaker to recuse himself from overseeing the Mueller probe or provided other ethical guidance related to his new job leading the Justice Department. The letter argues that Whitaker\u2019s stated views about Mueller and past connections to the Trump campaign \u2018indicate a clear bias against the investigation that would cause a reasonable person to question his impartiality.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, wrote a Post op-ed entitled, \u201cMatthew Whitaker, we\u2019re watching you:\u201d \u201cThe president and Whitaker should heed this warning: The new Democratic majority will protect the special counsel and the integrity of the Justice Department. Should Whitaker fail to recuse himself \u2014 all indications are that he plans not to \u2014 and seek to obstruct the investigation, serve as a back channel to the president or his legal team or interfere in the investigations in any way, he will be called to answer. His actions will be exposed.\u201d\n\n-- The state of Maryland is asking a federal judge for an injunction declaring Whitaker is not the legitimate acting attorney general. The New York Times\u2019s Charlie Savage reports: \u201cMr. Trump may not \u2018bypass the constitutional and statutory requirements for appointing someone to that office,\u2019 the plaintiffs said in a draft filing \u2026 Maryland is asking a judge \u2014 Ellen L. Hollander of the Federal District Court for the District of Maryland, a 2010 Obama appointee \u2014 to rule on who is the real acting attorney general as part of a lawsuit in which it sued [Jeff] Sessions in his official capacity. Because Mr. Sessions is no longer the attorney general, the judge must substitute his successor as a defendant in the litigation, so she has to decide who that successor legally is.\u201d\n\n-- But the Justice Department plans to issue a legal opinion supporting Whitaker\u2019s installation. The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Sadie Gurman and Byron Tau report: \u201cThe department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel is expected to say that [Trump] had the ability to appoint Mr. Whitaker, [one] person said. \u2026 The opinion is expected to support the Trump administration\u2019s position that the president\u2019s authority to tap Mr. Whitaker is affirmed by guidance the office issued in 2003. At that time, the office concluded that President George W. Bush could name a non-confirmed employee of the Office of Management and Budget as the agency\u2019s acting director.\u201d\n\n-- After Facebook granted several device-makers access to user data, the social media giant failed to police how those partners handled the data. The New York Times\u2019s Nicholas Confessore, Michael LaForgia and Gabriel J.X. Dance report: \u201cFacebook\u2019s loose oversight of the partnerships was detected by the company\u2019s government-approved privacy monitor in 2013. But it was never revealed to Facebook users, most of whom had not explicitly given the company permission to share their information. Details of those oversight practices were revealed in a letter Facebook sent last month to Senator Ron Wyden, the Oregon Democrat, a privacy advocate and frequent critic of the social media giant.\u201d\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan listen as President Trump speaks during a meeting with Republican lawmakers at the White House. (Evan Vucci/AP)\n\nTHE DOMESTIC AGENDA:\n\n-- House Democrats said their first bill will focus on strengthening voting rights and government ethics. NPR\u2019s Peter Overby reports: \u201cThe bill would establish automatic voter registration and reinvigorate the Voting Rights Act, crippled by a Supreme Court decision in 2013. It would take away redistricting power from state legislatures and give it to independent commissions. Other provisions would overturn the Supreme Court's Citizens United ruling, which declared political spending is First Amendment free speech; they would mandate more disclosure of outside money and establish a public financing match for small contributions.\u201d But the effort is unlikely to pass with a Republican-controlled Senate and make it through Trump.\n\n-- A bipartisan group of senators have reached an agreement on overhauling sentencing and prison laws. The New York Times\u2019s Nicholas Fandos and Maggie Haberman report: \u201cThe lawmakers believe they can get the measure to [Trump] during the final weeks of the year, if the president embraces it. The compromise would eliminate the so-called stacking regulation that makes it a federal crime to possess a firearm while committing another crime, like a drug offense; expand the \u2018drug safety valve\u2019 allowing judges to sidestep mandatory minimums for nonviolent drug offenders; and shorten mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders, according to draft text of the bill \u2026 It would also retroactively extend a reduction in the sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine signed into law in 2010, potentially affecting thousands of drug offenders serving lengthy sentences.\u201d\n\nCALIFORNIA ON FIRE:\n\n-- The Camp Fire has now claimed at least 42 lives, making it the deadliest fire in state history. Scott Wilson reports: \u201cThe thing about Paradise is that people expected to live out their lives here in the hills. The more than three dozen residents who burned to death \u2014 in cars, in homes, on foot \u2014 just imagined those lives would last longer. \u2026 The fire also stands as the most destructive in California history. More than 6,000 buildings have been destroyed, the vast majority of them homes. The Camp Fire tops the Tubbs Fire in its devastation, and the Tubbs Fire, which burned down large swaths of Santa Rosa, set the record less than a year ago. Gov. Jerry Brown (D) has called the intensifying fires, which include two others still burning uncontained just north of Los Angeles, the state\u2019s \u2018new abnormal.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- Trump\u2019s disparate reactions to tragedies in red states and blue states threatens to heighten the nation\u2019s intense partisan divisions. Matt Viser and Seung Min Kim report: \u201cWhen Hurricane Harvey pummeled Texas last year, he traveled to Houston, and when Hurricane Michael hit Florida and Georgia last month, he and the first lady quickly went to the Gulf Coast. But as California has convulsed in tragedy \u2014 a mass shooting and an outbreak of wildfires that included the deadliest in the state\u2019s history \u2014 the president has not only offered little comfort; he has also heaped on criticism. \u2026 A president who prizes and craves loyalty more than any other attribute, Trump has divided states into ones that voted for him and the ones that didn\u2019t, and found that last group wanting. In California, that has meant state officials are having to fight not only killer fires but also the combustible rhetoric coming from Oval Office.\u201d\n\n-- Democratic Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, said that Democrats will seek $720 million for wildfire relief. Erica Werner reports: \u201c[Leahy] dismissed criticism from [Trump] blaming the fires on poor fire management in California and threatening to cut off federal dollars unless the supposed problems are remedied. \u2018You have firefighters risking their life,\u2019 Leahy told reporters on a conference call. \u2018For them to see a tweet saying the U.S. Government won\u2019t support you, come on.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- The wildfires have largely prevented the Thousand Oaks community from processing the mass shooting that struck a local bar just last week. Katie Mettler reports: \u201cThe second tragedy of the week had somehow dwarfed the first. Outside Borderline there was a memorial, but it was scant: a floral cross and a small group of votive candles on the street corner. \u2026 The nation\u2019s mass shootings have begun to follow a somber and common protocol: the crime, the mayhem of the moment and the sobriety of the body count, the name of the shooter, the names of the victims, the vigils, the funerals, the questions that rarely produce answers.

Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) who heads the National Republican Senate Committee, joined President Trump and Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) in fanning conspiracy theories \u2014 baseless and irresponsible theories, that is \u2014 about possible vote stealing in Florida.\n\nOn Monday, a story ran in the Denver Post under this headline: \u201cColorado Republicans\u2019 conundrum: Donald Trump and the unaffiliated voters who loathe him; Insiders say Cory Gardner\u2019s re-election prospects are grim unless GOP can develop new message.\u201d The report went on to explain:\n\nBefore the election, Colorado Republicans controlled the state Senate, occupied three of the state\u2019s five statewide offices and held five of the state\u2019s nine seats in Congress. Then nearly 900,000 unaffiliated voters cast their ballots and handed decisive victories to Democrats. \u201cThe barn has been completely cleaned out,\u201d said David Flaherty, a Colorado Republican pollster. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to learn what motivated them. But you\u2019re kidding yourself if you say President Trump didn\u2019t have something to do with it.\u201d\n\nAs for Gardner, his home state paper reports, \u201cDemocrats have not been shy about their next target: U.S. Sen. Cory Gardner. The Yuma Republican now will be one of only two statewide GOP officeholders, and his political fate is tied to how he and Republicans answer these existential questions . . . In an interview with The Denver Post on Thursday, Gardner didn\u2019t shy away from Trump \u2014 in fact, he invited Trump and the entire Colorado congressional delegation to Colorado for a statewide tour.\u201d\n\nUmm. Do you get the sense Gardner\u2019s not paying attention \u2014 or is in denial?\n\nGardner and fellow Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine (where a Democratic governor was elected), Thom Tillis of North Carolina (where Democrats picked up both House and state legislative seats), Joni Ernst of Iowa (where Democrats flipped House seats) and even John Cornyn of Texas (where Beto O\u2019Rourke came within three points of winning and multiple House seats flipped) might want to keep a few things in mind if they want to hang onto their seats. (Arizona Republicans eyeing Sen. Jon Kyl\u2019s seat should pay attention if they want to keep a Senate seat in GOP hands.)\n\nFirst, don\u2019t go along with, parrot or condone Trump\u2019s anti-democratic, hateful, untrue and destructive comments. In fact, these lawmakers better start objecting, This will be hard for Cornyn, who is his party\u2019s whip in the Senate, but all of those sound bites are going to come back to bite them in 2020 if the country stays on its current trajectory.\n\nSecond, they should save the hand-wringing. Agonizing over a vote, only to vote with the president \u2014 or to refuse to take action to stop him \u2014 is not going to work. Voters are unimpressed if lawmakers have a witty Twitter feed or constantly says they\u2019re \u201cconcerned\u201d or \u201cworried\u201d if they do nothing to reach across the aisle to Democrats and take steps to remedy whatever Trump is up to or to rebuke him for his vile comments. (Call this the Sen. Ben Sasse rule.)\n\nThird, they are not the administration\u2019s defense counsel at hearings. They are members of a coequal branch of government charged with oversight. They should start acting like it. That means seriously questioning administration witnesses, agreeing to hold them in contempt if they refuse to provide information and voting against unqualified or radical nominees. In other words, they need to do their jobs.\n\nFinally, foolish excuses (the tax plan won\u2019t expand the debt!) and inept negotiating (if you don\u2019t get what you want, vote against the bill) won\u2019t satisfy voters, either. These feints at independence only make lawmakers look weak.\n\nIn sum, there will be a batch of Senate and some House seats for Democrats to flip. Now that women, college-educated, young and suburban voters have woken up and screamed \u201cEnough!\u201d Republicans cling to Trump and curry favor with the White House at their own risk. If they want to win independents\u2019 and moderates\u2019 voters support, they better stop acting like Trump lap dogs.\n\nRead more:\n\nRuy Teixeira: The midterms gave Democrats clear marching orders for 2020\n\nJennifer Rubin: What do the midterms say about 2020?\n\nJames Henson: Beto O\u2019Rourke should run for Senate in 2020.

But U.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg said late Monday that the secretary of state\u2019s office could not certify results before Friday and that it had to \u201cimmediately establish and publicize on its website a secure and free-access hotline or website for provisional ballot voters to access to determine whether their provisional ballots were counted and, if not, the reason why.\u201d\n\nKemp, who resigned as secretary of state late last week and declared victory, said that there are not enough outstanding votes to keep him from claiming the office. Lauren Groh-Wargo, Abrams\u2019s campaign manager, told reporters that as of Tuesday, Abrams needed 20,595 votes to force a runoff and 18,259 to initiate a recount.\n\nThe secretary of state\u2019s office has reported that 21,190 provisional ballots were cast in the Nov. 6 election. The Abrams campaign has said the number is more than 27,000. Voters are given provisional ballots if their registrations don\u2019t show up in voter rolls at their precincts or if they don\u2019t have proper identification.\n\nVoting rights were a major issue in the governor\u2019s race, in which Abrams, a former Democratic leader of the state House, was vying to be elected the nation\u2019s first black female governor. Kemp was criticized by Abrams and activists for championing strict voter registration and identification laws.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, in a separate case, a federal judge ordered Gwinnett County to stop rejecting absentee ballots with missing or incorrect birth dates. The ruling by U.S. District Judge Leigh Martin May addresses concerns raised by voting rights advocates on behalf of several voters and by Carolyn Bourdeaux, the Democratic candidate fighting who challenged Rep. Rob Woodall in the state\u2019s 7th Congressional District. Bourdeaux is hoping to either overtake Woodall in the vote count or force a recount. Bourdeaux\u2019s campaign estimates that 900 to 1,000 ballots are at issue.\n\nThe Abrams campaign is scheduled to be in federal court Tuesday afternoon to ask a judge to order counties to count some absentee ballots that have been rejected because of minor errors or because a voter was made to cast a provisional ballot because their current addresses do not match what is in the voter registration data base.\n\n\n\nVoters stand in line at the Pittman Park Recreation Center in Atlanta on Election Day. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nTotenberg, who also is overseeing a lawsuit to force the state to abandon its electronic voting machines in favor of paper ballots, said in Monday\u2019s ruling that Common Cause has \u201cshown a substantial likelihood of proving that the Secretary\u2019s failure to properly maintain a reliable and secure voter registration system has and will continue to result in the infringement of the rights of the voters to cast their vote and have their votes counted.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s ruling is a victory for the voters of Georgia. We are all stronger when every eligible voter is allowed to participate in our elections,\u201d Sara Henderson, executive director of Common Cause Georgia, said late Monday in a statement. \u201cThis victory helps achieve greater voter confidence in our elections.\u201d\n\nDuring phone call with reporters Tuesday afternoon, Groh-Wargo said that \u201cevery hour and day that goes by, additional votes get process\u201d and the gap between Abrams and Kemp continues to narrow.\n\nKemp campaign spokesman Ryan Mahoney said, \"While Democrats attempt to undermine Brian Kemp\u2019s convincing victory seven days ago, we remain confident in the local elections officials who are certifying the results.\u201d\n\nThe secretary of state\u2019s spokeswoman, Candice Broce, said, \u201cThe secretary of state\u2019s office is reviewing the order and considering our options with legal counsel.\u201d\n\nThe Common Cause suit refers to testimony from Chris Harvey, the state director of elections, that typically only half of the provisional ballots cast will probably be counted because of problems.\n\nIt also cited concerns over the security of the state\u2019s voter registration database, an issue that has arisen more than once during Kemp\u2019s tenure, including the Sunday before the election. Kemp\u2019s office issued a news release accusing the state\u2019s Democratic Party of a \u201cfailed attempt\u201d to hack the system. It turned out that activists were attempting to alert the secretary of state\u2019s office that the database was vulnerable to hacking.\n\n[Republicans fan unfounded worries about voter fraud in Florida and other close contests]\n\nIn her ruling, Totenberg rejected an assertion by the secretary of state\u2019s office that it needed to move up the certification date because of the need to prepare for a runoff between the candidates for secretary of state, neither of whom received more than 50 percent of the vote on Nov. 6. The law states that the secretary of state has up to 14 days after the election to certify, which would be Nov. 20.\n\nTotenberg said the secretary of state\u2019s attempt to expedite certification \u201cappears to suggest the Secretary\u2019s foregoing of its responsibility to confirm the accuracy of the results prior to final certification, including the assessment of whether serious provisional balloting count issues have been consistently and properly handled.\u201d\n\nVoters had until Friday to prove that they were duly registered or to prove their identities. The lawsuit names voters who said they were not given proper information about how to fix their ballots.\n\nTuesday\u2019s ruling in the Gwinnett case came a day after Bourdeaux, the Democratic congressional candidate, filed an emergency motion asking that the county be required to count ballots of voters who were properly registered but whose ballots were rejected for minor discrepancies. The suit argues that voters should be given the chance to correct issues flagged by county elections officials. The lawsuit refers to 323 affected ballots.\n\nThe most recent tally on the secretary of state\u2019s website shows Woodall with 50.16 percent of the vote to 49.84 percent for Bourdeaux. The unofficial results show Bourdeaux trailing by 901 votes.\n\nIn late October, May ordered Gwinnett to stop summarily rejecting ballots for \u201cperceived signature discrepancy,\u201d which the judge said was being made by elections staff on a \u201csubjective and arbitrary basis.\u201d That ruling came after voting rights advocates became alarmed that a large number of absentee ballots were being rejected by Gwinnett elections officials.\n\nVoters of color make up a majority of residents in Gwinnett, and voting rights groups said ballots of minority voters were being rejected at a higher rate than for white voters.\n\n\u201cFor the public to have confidence in this election cycle, it is critical that every vote be counted and every voice be heard,\u201d said Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. \u201cYet officials in communities like Gwinnett County remain bent on erecting unnecessary barriers to bar the counting of absentee and provisional ballots, particularly those cast by minority voters.\"\n\nThe Lawyers' Committee filed the motion Sunday in partnership with the Coalition for Good Governance.\n\nKemp also has been criticized for purging more than 1 million Georgia voters from rolls because they had not voted in previous elections or because they had supposedly moved. But many voters have come forward to say that they had, indeed, voted in previous elections and that they had made several attempts to update their records.\n\nOn another front, Sarah Riggs Amico, the Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor, sent a letter to the secretary of state\u2019s office raising concerns about an \u201cunusually high rate\u201d of drop-off in votes cast for her race compared to those for other statewide races.\n\nAmico\u2019s letter says that most troubling is the contrasting drop-off rate for votes cast on paper, 1 percent, and those cast on the state\u2019s electronic voting machines, about 7 percent.\n\n\u201cThese stark anomalies indicate serious inadequacies in the administration of the 2018 General Election,\u201d Amico wrote. The letter goes on to say that although Amico doesn\u2019t expect the residual votes to affect the outcome of the race, officials need to investigate to ensure that machines are functioning properly for the upcoming Dec. 4 runoff for some contests, including the one for secretary of state.\n\nOn Tuesday, police arrested more than a dozen protesters, including Georgia state senator Nikema Williams (D), during a demonstration at the state Capitol.

Cole was part of England\u2019s so-called Golden Generation, playing alongside David Beckham and Wayne Rooney.\n\n\u201cI hope the next two decades are as special as my last 20 years as a professional have been,\u201d Cole said. \u201cA huge thanks to everyone who helped me along that path.\u201d\n\nCole, a lifelong Chelsea supporter, joined West Ham at the age of eight and made 187 appearances, scoring 18 goals, in two spells, from 1998 to 2003 and 2013-14.\n\nHe moved across London to Chelsea after West Ham\u2019s relegation from the Premier League in 2003.\n\nCole won every domestic honor during his time at Chelsea, contributing to the west London club\u2019s first English title in 50 years in 2005 under Jose Mourinho.\n\nA 2 1/2-year spell at Liverpool saw Cole make only 42 appearances, scoring five goals. A season-long return to West Ham was followed by spells at Aston Villa, Coventry and then the Rowdies in Florida.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been incredibly fortunate to have played with some of the very best players of my era and even more fortunate to call a lot of them friends,\u201d Cole said. \u201cWinning trophies at Chelsea was particularly special for me. Those memories will live with me forever, as will the chance I had to share them with my family.\n\n\u201cLooking to the future, I want to stay involved in the game. I feel I can offer a lot as a coach. To lend my experience to help other young footballers achieve their dreams, just like I did, is a big passion of mine.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-Tex.) participates in the House Democrats' news conference on the Republican budget in 2014. (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call) (CQ Roll Call via AP Images)\n\nDemocrats are already planning to probe the policies and personnel of the Trump administration when they take control of the House, including the rollback of environmental rules imposed on emitters of pollution.\n\nBut environmentalists are trying to rally Democrats to investigate one company in particular: ExxonMobil.\n\nOn Monday, the environmental group 350.org began circulating a petition calling on the new Democratic majority in the House to open an inquiry into the largest U.S. oil and gas company \u201cfor misleading the public and wrecking the climate.\u201d\n\n\u201cDemocrats have not always shown the backbone to stand up to Big Oil,\u201d 350.org co-founder Jamie Henn told The Washington Post. \u201cWe hope that changes.\u201d\n\nSince 2015, Exxon has drawn the attention of investigative journalists and state prosecutors interested in understanding how much Exxon knew about climate change in the 1970s and 1980s as it began publicly questioning the science behind climate change, which found that its products were helping warm the planet.\n\nLast month, New York's inquiry came to a head when the state sued Exxon for allegedly misleading investors about the risk that climate-related regulations posed to its bottom line. Even though by 2007 Exxon publicly conceded that climate change was occurring, New York Attorney General Barbara D. Underwood (D) sued Exxon for allegedly defrauding shareholders through more recent communications about its calculations for the potential costs of carbon emissions.\n\nHenn said the House Science Committee, which has been led by retiring Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Tex.) since 2013, would be a \u201cgood place\u201d for an inquiry into Exxon to start. During his time with the gavel, Smith was one of the most vocal critics of climate science in Congress.\n\n\u201cIt only seems appropriate,\u201d Henn said.\n\nBut a spokeswoman for Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-Tex.), who appears likely to lead the science panel next year, declined to comment.\n\nA new slate of Democratic attorneys general elected last week, some of whom are taking over from Republican incumbents, could also potentially use their new offices to look into the climate work of Exxon and other oil companies. However, current some Democratic prosecutors have been reluctant to join in on the probe from the attorney general in New York, where state law grants prosecutors sweeping power.\n\nAt the very least, environmentalists may see an opportunity now that state attorney general offices in Michigan, Nevada and Wisconsin will be led by Democrats next year. The outgoing top prosecutors in those three states, each Republican, had either publicly or privately supported Exxon in its bid to squash New York's investigation.\n\nTHERMOMETER\n\n\u2014 California is on fire: The Camp Fire in Northern California is the deadliest wildfire ever in the state, with the death toll on Monday rising to 42.

But Wickremesinghe insisted his firing was unconstitutional. He refused to vacate his official residence and demanded that Parliament be summoned to prove he still has support.\n\nAmid mounting pressure from political opponents and foreign governments, including the United States and the EU, to convene Parliament to end the impasse, Sirisena announced the legislature would return this Wednesday.\n\nBut last Friday, he instead dissolved Parliament and called new elections in January. Opponents said Sirisena made the decision because Rajapaksa had been unable to assemble a majority.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled Tuesday to suspend the president\u2019s order until Dec. 7, after 13 political parties and individuals filed petitions with the court calling the dissolution unconstitutional. It said it would hold hearings on the case starting Dec. 4.\n\nWickremesinghe welcomed the ruling, calling it \u201ca resounding victory for people\u2019s franchise.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe powers of the president are limited. The president must act according to the law, he is not above the law,\u201d he said.\n\nHours after the court\u2019s ruling, the office of the speaker of Parliament announced that lawmakers would meet at 10 a.m. Wednesday.\n\nWickremesinghe said he was ready to \u201cshow that we have the majority and that we are the legitimate government of Sri Lanka.\u201d\n\nAfter the ruling was announced, hundreds of opposition supporters who had gathered near the court cheered and lit firecrackers.\n\nJehan Perera, executive director of the National Peace Council of Sri Lanka, said the order \u201cproves that Sri Lanka\u2019s judiciary is independent and that they were prepared to give a judgment that went against the executive.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a positive indication of the continuing strength of Sri Lanka\u2019s institutions and their independence which is important to the sustenance of our democracy,\u201d he added.\n\nTensions had been building between Sirisena and Wickremesinghe for some time, as the president did not approve of economic reforms introduced by the prime minister. Sirisena has also accused Wickremesinghe and another Cabinet member of plotting to assassinate him, a charge Wickremesinghe has repeatedly denied.\n\nSirisena was also critical of investigations into military personnel who were accused of human rights violations during Sri Lanka\u2019s 25-year civil war against a Tamil separatist group, which ended in 2009.\n\nRajapaksa, who was president from 2005 to 2015, is considered a hero by some in Sri Lanka\u2019s ethnic Sinhalese majority for ending the war by crushing the Tamil rebels.\n\nBut his time in power was marred by allegations of war-time atrocities, corruption and nepotism.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) takes the stage alongside his wife Connie Schultz during the Ohio Democratic Party election night watch party in Columbus, Ohio last week. (AP Photo/John Minchillo)\n\nThe Democratic presidential field could soon add another heavyweight anti-Wall Street populist: Sen. Sherrod Brown, fresh off a convincing reelection victory in right-trending Ohio, confirmed Monday that he is considering entering the race.\n\nBrown would join what\u2019s shaping up to be a historically crowded Democratic field, and one that looks likely to include Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), a fellow antagonist of financial giants and member of the Senate Banking Committee. Brown, the top Democrat on the panel, told cleveland.com he plans to discuss the move with his family over the holidays.\n\nHis reelection by six points in a perennial swing state that President Trump carried by eight points in 2016 has reignited speculation about his national ambitions. It helps that Brown appeared to cruise even as other Ohio Democrats floundered: Richard Cordray, with similar bona fides as the former director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, lost his gubernatorial bid by four points; House candidates failed to flip a single Republican seat; and they lost a state Senate seat.\n\nBrown in his interview said he has heard from an \u201coverwhelming\u201d number of people telling him to consider a run. And he said his reelection campaign\u2019s message of worker empowerment offers a playbook for national Democrats. \u201cMy message clearly appeals to Democrats, Republicans and independents,\u201d he said. \u201cWe showed you can get votes by being authentic and standing up for workers. People in Washington don't understand the dignity of work.\u201d\n\nBrown\u2019s campaign \u2014 emphasizing the need to protect health care coverage and shore up workers\u2019 pensions, railing against what he framed as a regressive Republican tax cut, while continuing to underline his opposition to free trade deals \u2014 was emblematic of his lunch-bucket approach over 12 years in the Senate. And it likely formed the spine of a national run, should he make one.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t Brown\u2019s message alone that lifted him to victory. His $27.7 million war chest was the biggest of any Democratic campaign in Ohio\u2019s history. His opponent, Rep. Jim Renacci, had some unique flaws, including having to defend borrowing a strip-club owner\u2019s private jet to meet with faith leaders late in the campaign. Plus, Brown\u2019s winning margin, while comfortable, was tighter than polls predicted; his victory map doesn\u2019t reveal a sea of blue. He only won 16 of the state\u2019s 88 counties.\n\nSen, Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) greets Rep. Katherine Clark (D-Mass.) before giving her victory speech in Boston last Tuesday. (AP Photo/Michael Dwyer)\n\nYet a closer look at Tuesday's results reveal Brown showed strength by limiting his losses in rural conservative strongholds. Ohio political watchers say that performance helps explain how Brown secured roughly 281,000 more votes than Cordray \u2014 and roughly 100,000 more than Mike DeWine, the Republican who won the governor\u2019s race. \u201cThe difference between [Brown and Cordray] is much larger in places where Democrats don\u2019t do well,\u201d said one national Democratic strategist with experience working on Ohio campaigns.\n\nBrown recaptured a handful of Trump counties in the northeastern corner of the state \u2014 steel country \u2014 including Ashtabula, Trumbull, Lake and Portage counties. He also carried Montgomery County in southwestern Ohio, home to the midsize city of Dayton, by more than 23,000 votes. Cordray, by contrast, lost it by about 1,100. The county is something of a bellwether within a bellwether, with a roughly even split between urban, suburban and rural voters. President Obama carried it in both his campaigns, then Trump won it in 2016.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty perfect place to look at where the realignment is happening across the state,\u201d Dayton mayor Nan Whaley, a Democrat, tells me.\n\nThat is, as ProPublica reporter Alec MacGillis noted on Twitter last week, that Ohio is becoming friendlier territory for a Republican party increasingly reliant on white blue-collar voters:\n\nWhat could be driving such a transformation? Well, for one thing, demographics. As the share of white non-college voters drops nationwide, it\u2019s holding strong in Ohio. The state is 82 percent white and only 28 percent of Ohioans have completed some higher ed. \u2014 Alec MacGillis (@AlecMacGillis) November 8, 2018\n\nWhaley said Brown\u2019s focus on the ravages of free trade deals, an issue Cordray didn\u2019t seize, helped him run up the score. And while Brown\u2019s position has been a rare point of agreement between him and Trump, Whaley says Brown was there first. \u201cIt\u2019s not like Sherrod is suddenly on the bandwagon. When Obama was for the [Trans-Pacific Partnership], Sherrod was against it. It defines who he is.\u201d\n\nMore important, she says, is Brown\u2019s message on \u201cthe dignity of work.\u201d It was a central pillar of his campaign: \u201cThat no one is really talking about people who are working hard, playing by the rules and falling further behind. I think the party misses that point\u2026 I really hope he runs. I don't see how you get through the industrial midwest without that message.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Brown\u2019s ad on the subject \u2014 titled \u201cDignity\u201d \u2014 could just as easily work for a national run, since he didn't mention the office he\u2019s seeking:\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of communities in Iowa that have similar backgrounds to a lot of the communities in Ohio,\u201d says Aaron Pickrell, a Democratic strategist in Ohio. \u201cYou could argue that a candidate from the part of the country between Pennsylvania and Iowa has a special ability to campaign in Michigan, Wisconsin and Ohio,\u201d states that helped deliver Trump to the presidency.\n\nBrown, in his victory speech, only invoked Trump\u2019s name once. But he used the talk in part to critique what he sees as president\u2019s brand of populism. \u201cPopulists are not racists. Populists are not anti-Semitic,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWhen we see a White House that looks like a retreat for Wall Street executives, we know that our fight is far from over. We have so much left to do to raise wages, lower healthcare costs and make sure everyone who works hard can retire with the dignity that they have earned.\u201d\n\nThe senator on the campaign trail regularly criticized the Republican tax cut as a giveaway to the wealthiest. In the Senate, he opposed the bill rolling back some Dodd-Frank regulations that moderates on his panel worked with Republicans to pass. He has slammed efforts by the Trump administration \u2014 and Trump-appointed banking regulators \u2014 to ease post-crisis rules on the industry.\n\nMARKET MOVERS\n\nTrader Thomas Ferrigno, right, and specialist Gregg Maloney work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Nov. 9. (Richard Drew/AP)\n\n\u2014 Tech concerns drive market drop. The Washington Post's Thomas Heath: \u201cU.S. markets dropped Monday on renewed fears that the tech sector has run out of steam. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 601 points, or 2.3 percent, to 25,387.18, in the session. The blue-chip barometer was dragged lower by the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index, which tanked 2.8 percent on the weak technology shares. . . . The Nasdaq has been in a pressure cooker for weeks as technology, particularly the so-called FAANG companies \u2014 Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google-parent Alphabet \u2014 have hit turbulence with investors. \u2018It\u2019s mostly Apple,\u2019 said Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research. \u2018More selling of the FAANG stocks. The stocks that can do no wrong now are tripping up. They were leading the market higher and the market narrowed over the past year as the big-cap tech names led the way up.

On Monday, the company announced a 17 percent cut in its December-quarter revenue outlook. That triggered a plunge in shares of Apple and its suppliers, and reverberated through stock markets in the U.S. and Asia.\u201d\n\nTrump points to Democrats. Bloomberg News's Justin Sink: \u201cTrump turned to a new explanation for stock market declines Monday, blaming scrutiny his administration could face from Democrats who recently won the majority in the House of Representatives. \u2018The prospect of Presidential Harassment by the Dems is causing the Stock Market big headaches!\u2019 he tweeted Monday. . . . Ahead of the elections, Trump tweeted stocks would \u2018go down\u2019 if Democrats prevailed. The S&P 500 rallied 2.1 percent the day after the vote, but has fallen in each of the three days since, erasing the post-election rally as concerns about global growth re-emerge . . . Still, Trump appears eager to shift blame for future losses to his newly empowered political opponents \u2014 while also seeking to head off congressional investigations into ethical scandals and policy controversies during his first two years in office.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Investors worry about dollar's strength. CNBC's Patti Domm: \u201cStocks investors are spooked about a lot of things, and the strong dollar biting into earnings growth is now one of them . . . The dollar's strength Monday was largely attributed to weakness in the British pound and euro because of negative Brexit news and concerns about Italy's budget. But the dollar has also been rising on trade war concerns, rising U.S. interest rates and weaker growth rates outside the U.S.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Flake, Coons tell Trump to stop criticizing the Fed. WSJ's Nick Timiraos: \"Two U.S. senators called on President Trump Monday to stop publicly criticizing the Federal Reserve and warned his comments could jeopardize the central bank\u2019s credibility and hurt the economy. In a letter to Mr. Trump, Sens. Chris Coons (D., Del.) and Jeff Flake (R., Ariz.) also said Mr. Trump\u2019s disagreement with the central bank over interest-rate policies wouldn\u2019t be a sufficient reason to remove any Fed leaders, including Chairman Jerome Powell... 'Your ill-advised commentary goes beyond holding the Fed accountable,' said Sens. Coons and Flake in the letter to Mr. Trump. 'You appear to be telling the Fed what to do with interest rates, which we believe is unconstructive and dangerous.'\"\n\nFed's Daly says more rate hikes are warranted. Bloomberg News's Jeanna Smialek: \u201cFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President Mary Daly said U.S. policy makers ought to be gradually lifting interest rates to bring an economy that\u2019s running above potential in for a soft landing. \u2018It wouldn\u2019t be surprising to me that we would need to go up again in December and at least a couple of times next year,\u2019 Daly told Bloomberg News in her first interview on policy since she became head of the regional Fed branch on Oct. 1.\u201d\n\n\u2014 U.S. could boost global growth next year. Bloomberg\u2019s Peter Coy: \u201cJudging by recent headlines, the global economy is on a wild roller coaster that\u2019s going mostly downhill. There are Brexit, trade wars, Italy\u2019s fight with the European Union, renewed U.S. sanctions on Iran, a Chinese debt bomb, jittery stock markets, intermittent capital flight from developing nations, and more. The data tell a calmer and happier story.\n\n\u201cAccording to the International Monetary Fund, the global economy is on track to grow a healthy 3.7 percent in 2018. That\u2019s exactly how fast it grew in 2017. The IMF\u2019s forecast for 2019? Again, 3.7 percent. It\u2019s a plateau, all right, but a high plateau\u2014call it the Altiplano of economics.

WSJ's Bob Davis and Lingling Wei: \"Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has resumed discussions with his Chinese counterpart, Vice Premier Liu He, about a deal that would ease trade tension, ahead of a meeting of the leaders of China and the U.S. set for the end of the month. The two spoke by telephone on Friday, said people briefed on the conversation, as the U.S. demands that China put forward a concrete offer before negotiations on a trade deal can take place. Chinese officials are resisting and say they want to talk first before making a formal proposal. They worry that once they make a formal offer they will lose leverage, say officials in both countries. The Friday conversation didn\u2019t lead to any breakthrough in those issues but the renewed discussions indicate the two sides are trying to reach an accommodation, the officials say.\"\n\nIt's not just about tariffs. WSJ's Kate O\u2019Keeffe: \u201cThe Trump administration is broadening its China trade battle beyond tariffs with a plan to use export controls, indictments and other tools to counter the theft of intellectual property . . . The opening move in the new strategy came in the form of a recent crackdown by the Commerce and Justice Departments on a Chinese state-owned chip maker, which the U.S. administration accused of stealing trade secrets from Idaho-based Micron Technology Inc . . . U.S. officials are looking at additional cases where they could use a similar combination of tools to fight Chinese IP theft . . . The officials hope that the unprecedented actions taken to defend Micron \u2014 the largest American memory-chip maker \u2014 will encourage more U.S. companies to work with the government to counter intellectual property theft . . . The new blueprint will only work in certain cases and requires extensive resources and interagency coordination to address the thefts on a case-by-case basis.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Auto tariffs advance. Bloomberg\u2019s Jennifer Jacobs and Jenny Leonard: \u201cThe White House is circulating a draft report by the U.S. Commerce Department over whether to impose tariffs on automobile imports to protect national security, three people familiar with the matter said.

That has Democrats ready to resist the president\u2019s demand for border money, now expected to be a minimum of $5 billion for the fiscal year.\"\n\n\u2014 What the tax cut has delivered so far. NYT's Jim Tankersley and Matt Phillips: \"The $1.5 trillion tax overhaul that President Trump signed into law late last year has already given the American economy a jolt, at least temporarily. It has fattened the paychecks of most American workers, padded the profits of large corporations and sped economic growth. Those results weren\u2019t a surprise. Economists across the ideological spectrum predicted the new law would fuel consumer spending, in classic fashion: When the government borrows money and dumps it into the economy, growth tends to accelerate.\n\n\"But Republicans did not sell the law as a sugar-high stimulus. They sold it as a refashioning of the incentives in the American economy \u2014 one that would unleash more investment, better efficiency and higher wages, along with enough growth to offset any revenue lost to the government from lower tax rates.

Jason Lewis (R-Minn.) at a rally in October. (Craig Lassig/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\nYou could cite a multitude of people and circumstances that put GOP candidates in a real health-care bind this year.\n\nThe late Sen. John McCain, who died of brain cancer in August, wasn\u2019t one of them.\n\nRep. Jason Lewis \u2014 a freshman Minnesota Republican who lost his seat last week \u2014 prompted outrage Monday for a Wall Street Journal op-ed in which he blamed McCain and his vote against an Affordable Care Act repeal bill for Republicans losing their House majority.\n\n\u201cThe Republican Party lost its House majority on July 28, 2017, when Sen. John McCain ended the party\u2019s seven-year quest to repeal ObamaCare,\u201d Lewis wrote. \u201cHouse leadership had done an admirable job herding cats. On the second try, we passed the American Health Care Act in May. Then McCain\u2019s inscrutable vote against the Senate\u2019s \u2018skinny repeal\u2019 killed the reform effort.\u201d\n\nLewis went on to claim that McCain\u2019s vote prompted liberal special-interest groups to \u201cpropagate false claims\u201d that the House bill gutted coverage for people with preexisting conditions. \u201cThat line was the Democrats\u2019 most potent attack in the midterms,\u201d he wrote.\n\nLewis is right about one thing: Attacking Republicans for how they would have treated people with preexisting medical conditions certainly was Democrats\u2019 strongest narrative in the elections. It got their voters out the door and to the ballot box; multiple exit polls found health care was the top issue among Democratic voters.\n\nHouse Democrats are already planning to keep the issue front-and-center in January by holding a vote affirming the ACA\u2019s requirements for insurers to cover people with preexisting conditions and opposing a lawsuit from GOP-led states seeking to strike the ACA.\n\nBut Lewis isn\u2019t right about much else. If anything, McCain\u2019s move to halt the Senate\u2019s \u201cskinny repeal\u201d bill saved Republicans from ultimately passing what probably would have been deeply unpopular health-care legislation \u2014 and provided even more fodder for Democrats to use against them.\n\nLewis\u2019s short piece \u2014 only 469 words \u2013 gave rise to widespread condemnation from not just Democrats but Republicans, too. Some observers also noted the op-ed attacking McCain, a celebrated war hero, was published on Veterans Day.\n\nDoug Holtz-Eakin, an economist and former Congressional Budget Office director under George W. Bush:\n\nThis is ridiculous and laughable. But it is a huge disappointment that @WSJ would choose Veterans Day to dignify this nonsense. https://t.co/BUjSybwF1U \u2014 Douglas Holtz-Eakin (@djheakin) November 12, 2018\n\nPolitico's Jake Sherman:\n\nthink about all that went into this.

Perhaps he was seeking someone to blame for his loss. But whatever his motivation, his piece shows a remarkable lack of knowledge about the details of the health-care bills Republicans advanced \u2014 and why they ultimately failed.\n\nLet\u2019s untangle a few of Lewis\u2019s claims:\n\n1. Lewis writes the House-passed health-care bill \u2014 the American Health Care Act \u2014 protected people with preexisting conditions.\n\nIt\u2019s true that the AHCA said \u201cnothing in this Act shall be construed as permitting insurers to limit access to health coverage for individuals with preexisting conditions.\u201d\n\nHouse Republican leaders writing that bill retained the ACA\u2019s requirement to cover people with preexisting conditions without hiking premiums, recognizing it would be politically toxic to erase those popular protections.\n\nWhat Lewis doesn\u2019t note is that additional language was tacked on as leadership tried to get its Republicans in line to approve the legislation.\n\nHard-line House Freedom Caucus members threatened to rebel because they felt too much of Obamacare was being kept. That led to extended negotiations between their leader, Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), and moderate Rep. Tom MacArthur (R-N.J.). The two congressmen negotiated language allowing states to apply for waivers from the ACA\u2019s ban on higher premiums for people with preexisting conditions. That could have had the effect of preventing some sick Americans from accessing coverage because their monthly premiums could have been exorbitantly high.\n\nSen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) speaks to reporters in July 2017. (Cliff Owen/AP)\n\n2. Lewis writes that McCain\u2019s vote against the Senate health-care bill \u201ckilled\u201d the whole repeal-and-replace effort.\n\nThere are multiple things wrong with this assertion. First, the House health-care bill wasn\u2019t even on the table in the Senate. It would have enacted deeper cuts to future Medicaid spending than many moderate Senate Republicans were comfortable with, not to mention the pathway away from preexisting protections it opened up for states.\n\nThe Senate couldn\u2019t approve its own version of a health-care bill, and it wasn\u2019t just McCain who blocked multiple attempts to do so.\n\nOver one week in July 2017, the Senate took up \u2014 and rejected \u2014 several iterations of measures to roll back Obamacare. Nine Republicans opposed the Senate\u2019s replacement bill, called the Better Care Reconciliation Act. Seven Republicans voted against a pared-back version that would have delayed replacement for two years.\n\nIt was Senate Republicans\u2019 last-ditch effort \u2014 a \u201cskinny\u201d bill that repealed only a small portion of the law (its mandates to buy insurance and its tax on medical devices) that McCain is blamed for blocking. He and moderate Sens. Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) and Susan Collins (Maine) were the three Republicans to vote against that measure.\n\nBut even if McCain had gone along with skinny repeal, it\u2019s still not at all clear the House and Senate would have been able to unite to pass an Obamacare replacement at all. Republicans were hopelessly divided over a whole host of issues, including preexisting conditions and how much to spend on subsidies and Medicaid. Both the House and Senate bills were deeply unpopular with the public and would probably have resulted in fewer Americans with insurance coverage.\n\nAnd it\u2019s clear McCain\u2019s action didn\u2019t give rise to Democratic attacks on preexisting conditions. House Republicans had already baked that cake.\n\nAHH, OOF and OUCH\n\nSen.-elect Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) smiles after her victory over Rep. Martha McSally (R-Ariz.). The race was called last night.

(REUTERS/Fiston Mahamba/File Photo)\n\nOOF: Health officials will soon launch a clinical trial that will mark the next move in the global response to Ebola and the latest outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nThe trial will \u201ctest whether experimental Ebola therapies improve patients\u2019 chances of survival\u201d in the DRC's outbreak, Stat News\u2019s Helen Branswell reports.\n\n\u201cThe randomized controlled trial will compare three different antibody treatments and an antiviral drug to each other, rather than involving a placebo,\u201d Helen writes. \u201cIt is unlikely that the trial will produce clear results based on a single epidemic; it is expected to span several outbreaks and countries \u2014 a novel and challenging design.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe four experimental therapies that will be tested have been used for weeks in Ebola treatment units being operated by nongovernmental organizations Doctors Without Borders (MSF) and Alima,\u201d Helen writes, adding that 139 patients had as of Friday received one of the four therapies. \u201cIt is unusual for unlicensed drugs to be used in such quantities outside of the context of a clinical trial. In this case, the authorization came through a sort of compassionate use protocol established by the WHO. The idea was that the protocol would serve as a bridge to allow use while a clinical trial was being designed and signed off on by the numerous parties that have a stake in the process.\u201d\n\n(iStock)\n\nOUCH: This week, two mothers plan to visit the office of insulin maker Sanofi in Massachusetts, bringing with them the ashes of their children who died in part because of insulin rationing due to the cost of treatment.\n\nThe two mothers, who earlier this year protested at the Minnesota state capitol and later went to Indianapolis to meet with a representative of insulin maker Eli Lilly, will participate in a \u201cdie-in\u201d at the Sanofi office, Stat News\u2019s Megan Thielking reports.\n\n\u201cAnger over insulin prices in the U.S. has swelled as the nation\u2019s largest insulin makers have hiked the price of the drug,\u201d Megan writes. \u201cThose price increases are now the subject of a class-action lawsuit and have drawn the attention of lawmakers in Washington.

(Peter Smith/Stratford Festival)\n\nThe film featured a cast of prehistoric apes, scientists investigating a mysterious black monolith on the moon, astronauts bound for Jupiter, and an embryonic \u201cstar child\u201d floating above Earth.\n\nBut to critics, fans and the 1968 movie\u2019s nominal leading man, actor Keir Dullea, the most compelling character in \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey\u201d was far and away a talking computer, the HAL 9000. Depicted by filmmaker Stanley Kubrick as a camera lens with a glowing red dot \u2014 a cycloptic eye that enabled him to read lips \u2014 HAL was voiced to chilling effect by Douglas Rain, a Shakespearean actor celebrated as one of the finest classical stage performers in Canada.\n\nMr. Rain was 90 when he died Nov. 11 at a hospital in St. Marys, Ontario, about a dozen miles from Stratford, where he had lived and long performed with the repertory company of the Stratford Festival. The festival announced his death but did not give a precise cause.\n\nIn a statement, Stratford artistic director Antoni Cimolino called Mr. Rain one of Canadian theater\u2019s \u201cgreatest talents and a guiding light in its development,\u201d adding that he \u201cshared many of the same qualities as Kubrick\u2019s iconic creation: precision, strength of steel, enigma and infinite intelligence, as well as a wicked sense of humor.\u201d\n\nA onetime child actor for the radio broadcaster Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, Mr. Rain studied at a drama school in London before returning to Canada in 1953, where he played supporting parts in the Stratford\u2019s inaugural production, \u201cRichard III,\u201d and served as the understudy for Alec Guinness in the title role.\n\nMr. Rain performed at the Shakespearean festival for 32 seasons, settling some two blocks from the theater and erecting a partial model of its thrust stage in his attic, where he practiced at night after rehearsals. He described his work as that of a \u201cglorified detective,\u201d a craft in which he was driven to pore over scripts for insight into a character\u2019s background and motivation.\n\n\n\nThe red \u201ceye\u201d of the HAL 9000 computer, voiced by Mr. Rain in \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey.\u201d (Mary Evans/MGM/Polaris/Stanley Kubrick Productions/Ronald Grant/Everett Collection)\n\nAt other times, said actress Marion Day, who performed alongside Mr. Rain at several Stratford productions, he likened acting to carpentry: \u201cIt was something that was very finely done. You could run your hand over it and not perceive joints.\u201d\n\nWhen Mr. Rain delivered his lines, she added, \u201cit was as if the language and himself and everything just disappeared. There were just ideas and thoughts and complex moments happening inside me. He took away a barrier between me and the writer. These things were happening for the first time, as if no one had ever thought them or said them before, as if they were newly minted.\u201d\n\nThough he spent nearly his entire career in Canada, he was nominated for a Tony Award in 1972 for his supporting role as William Cecil, the wily statesman in \u201cVivat! Vivat Regina!,\u201d playwright Robert Bolt\u2019s take on the rivalry between Queen Elizabeth I and her cousin Mary Queen of Scots.\n\nIn a quirk of the stage, Mr. Rain also starred several times as Prince Hal, the rebellious protagonist of Shakespeare\u2019s two-part history \u201cHenry IV.\u201d But he became far better known for his more subdued portrayal of HAL, whose servile demeanor and detached, near-monotone voice are sometimes credited with informing the personas of Amazon\u2019s Alexa and Apple\u2019s Siri.\n\n\u201cMr. Rain\u2019s HAL has become the default reference, not just for the voice, but also for the humanesque qualities of what a sentient machine\u2019s personality should be,\u201d Gerry Flahive, a writer and producer, wrote in an April account of HAL\u2019s origins for the New York Times.\n\n1 of 67 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Notable deaths in 2018: Stan Lee, John McCain, Aretha Franklin and other famous faces we lost this year View Photos Remembering those who have died in 2018.

Fearing that the crew will prevent the mission from being carried out, he murders three scientists who are being kept in hibernation, then severs the oxygen hose of a fourth crew member during a spacewalk.\n\n\u201cOpen the pod bay doors, HAL,\u201d the last surviving astronaut, Dave Bowman (Dullea), says while trapped outside the ship. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Dave,\u201d HAL responds. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t do that. . . . This mission is too important for me to allow you to jeopardize it.\u201d\n\nMr. Rain was far from Kubrick\u2019s first choice to play HAL. Devised by Kubrick and his fellow screenwriter, Arthur C. Clarke, the character was originally envisioned for an actress \u2014 Kubrick\u2019s notes mention Joan Baez and Barbra Streisand as possibilities \u2014 before Kubrick settled on a man, casting Bronx-born character actor Martin Balsam.\n\nAbout that same time, Kubrick hired Mr. Rain to narrate a science-heavy prologue for the film. The segment, ultimately cut, was apparently inspired by Kubrick\u2019s love of \u201cUniverse\u201d (1960), a short educational film narrated by Mr. Rain, who recalled that it was made using table-tennis balls and with a tomato playing the sun.\n\nMonths into filming, when Kubrick decided that Balsam \u201csounded a little bit too colloquially American,\u201d he asked Mr. Rain to give it a shot, later telling critic Joseph Gelmis that Mr. Rain \u201chad the kind of bland Mid-Atlantic accent we felt was right for the part.\u201d In fact, the accent was Standard Canadian English.\n\nAlthough some early critics said \u201c2001\u201d was too long and too slow, the movie has acquired the reputation of a science-fiction masterpiece, with Mr. Rain\u2019s performance often singled out for praise. His character was ranked 13th on the American Film Institute\u2019s list of greatest movie villains, ahead of the shark from \u201cJaws\u201d and the Nazi commandant Amon Goeth from \u201cSchindler\u2019s List.\u201d\n\nMr. Rain played HAL again in a sequel, \u201c2010: The Year We Made Contact\u201d (1984), written and directed by Peter Hyams. But he resisted efforts to commercialize his performance, declining an invitation to provide the voice for an Apple commercial that aired during the 1999 Super Bowl.\n\nHe also cultivated techniques to avoid attention from fans who asked him to \u201copen the pod bay doors,\u201d creating \u201ca secret ring\u201d for friends who wanted to reach him on his home telephone and devising a quick escape route from the Stratford, Day said.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019d be changed before anyone else could think of being changed,\u201d she said, \u201cand go down into the underworld under the stage, go up into a tunnel next to the audience, and leave while they were getting up out of their seats and collecting their programs \u2014 with his cap down over this eyes so people wouldn\u2019t know it was him.\u201d\n\nDouglas James Rain was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, on May 9, 1928. His father was a switchman for the Canadian National Railway, and his mother was a nurse who encouraged his interest in acting, beginning with an appearance on a CBC radio play when he was 8. Mr. Rain later recalled that he had to stand on a wooden crate to reach the microphone.\n\nHe graduated from the University of Manitoba in 1950 and studied at the former Old Vic theater school in London, then run by actor Glen Byam Shaw, before nailing an audition with director Tyrone Guthrie, who brought him to the Stratford. The festival\u2019s early productions were held in a tent, where line readings were sometimes accompanied by cheers from a nearby baseball field.\n\nMr. Rain appeared in Guthrie-directed shows including Christopher Marlowe\u2019s \u201cTamburlaine the Great,\u201d which came to Broadway in 1956, and a mask-filled production of Sophocles\u2019 \u201cOedipus Rex,\u201d filmed for wide release in 1957.\n\nHe went on to play leading roles in productions of \u201cOthello,\u201d \u201cKing John\u201d and \u201cHenry V,\u201d starred opposite Maggie Smith in a 1978 production of \u201cMacbeth,\u201d and appeared as Shylock in \u201cThe Merchant of Venice\u201d in 1996, two years before his final season with the festival.\n\nIn addition to his work at Stratford, Mr. Rain served for several years as head of the English acting section at the National Theatre School of Canada, and performed at Canadian venues including the National Arts Centre, the Tarragon Theatre and the Shaw Festival.\n\nHis marriages to Lois Shaw and Martha Henry, a fellow Stratford performer, ended in divorce. Survivors include two sons from his first marriage; a daughter from his second marriage; and a granddaughter.\n\nIn an interview with the Times this year, Mr. Rain said he completed his \u201c2001\u201d recordings in about 10 hours, sitting a few feet from Kubrick at an MGM lot near London. At one point, Kubrick had him sing \u201cDaisy Bell\u201d \u2014 the love song that HAL croaks out before being disconnected \u2014 about 50 times, in varying tempos and pitches. Kubrick went with the first take.\n\n\u201cIf you could have been a ghost at the recording you would have thought it was a load of rubbish,\u201d Mr. Rain said. Alas, he apparently never got the chance to see otherwise. Although it had been 50 years since \u201c2001\u201d was released, he told the Times he had never seen the film.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this obituary incorrectly reported that Mr. Rain studied at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School in Britain. He attended a different theater school based at the Old Vic in London. The article also said Mr. Rain voiced an evil computer in the Woody Allen comedy \u201cSleeper.\u201d His family says that contrary to news reports, he never played that role, which was uncredited in the film. Two other sources, his friend Marion Day and writer-producer Gerry Flahive, say he never discussed the part.

Enormous energy has been pumped into the movement, with parishes around the country holding crowded listening sessions on the topic, bishops making abuse the focus of their annual fall meeting this week and legislators finding new support for measures to expand statutes of limitation for child sexual abuse.\n\nBut the victims\u2019 advocacy movement is also being transformed by bitter ideological divides among Catholics. That chasm was dramatically on display this week at the semi-annual meeting of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops in Baltimore.\n\nMonday\u2019s two public events were dominated by the older groups \u2014 research site BishopAccountability and SNAP \u2014 whose leaders focus on oversight and justice and participate less in the controversial debates over the perceived roles of celibacy and homosexuality in the crisis. A dozen or so people attended each of those events, and around 20 came Tuesday to stand with survivors who raised signs with words including \u201ctruth\u201d and \u201creform.\u201d\n\nA few hours later, the right-wing advocacy group and news site Church Militant hosted more than 300 protesters under a pavilion for a revival-like rally. The profile of the group, whose leaders and web site blame abuse scandals on homosexual priests and a general falling away from orthodoxy, got a boost Tuesday as James Grein, one of two people who this summer accused ex-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick of child sexual abuse, appeared for the first time in public at the rally.\n\nThe crowd roared as Grein singled out a pope who some on the right wing see as heretical and politically too liberal.\n\n\u201cJesus\u2019 law is much higher than pontifical secrets. It\u2019s not Francis\u2019 church, it\u2019s Jesus Christ\u2019s church,\u201d said Grein, who says McCarrick abused him for nearly two decades, starting when he was a boy. McCarrick\u2019s suspension in June launched the current scandal in the church..\n\n[Vatican asks U.S. bishops not to vote on sexual abuse proposals]\n\nWhile mainstream survivors groups declined to team up with Church Militant in Baltimore, its hefty social media audience \u2014 200,000 Facebook followers \u2014 adopted the abuse scandals as a cause this summer.\n\nThe older survivors' groups have shied away from Church Militant in part because it does not routinely cover female victims of clergy sex abuse or go after conservative bishops who have allegedly abused. These groups want to keep the focus on goals like identifying abusers and creating policies and practices that require transparency and help victims.\n\n\u201cI feel like they\u2019re using victims for a political agenda and I\u2019m concerned about that. They\u2019re using this to kind of get to where they want to be,\u201d SNAP\u2019s regional director, Becky Ianni, said of Church Militant. \u201cAnd I hate when someone uses victims. Victims aren\u2019t conservative or liberal. We\u2019re victims. And that\u2019s what people need to focus on.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Church Militant represents a large new audience for some longtime advocates who want to keep attention on abuse\u2014 even as its approach presents land mines for long-established groups.\n\nReferring to Church Militant and other far-right websites like Breitbart and LifeSite that have taken up aspects of the cause, BishopAccountability co-director Anne Barrett Doyle said, \u201cI see they perform a service to some extent in that they expose predatory bishops and predatory priests that mainstream press aren\u2019t yet covering. But at the same time, because they have a different goal, their goal isn\u2019t simple justice and accountability and transparency \u2014 there is a bias.\u201d\n\nAsked for comment on the role of Church Militant, the bishops' conference issued a statement saying the umbrella group \"supports everyone\u2019s right to a peaceful protest.\u201d\n\nUntil this summer, posts on the Church Militant site were primarily focused on aggressively fighting advancements toward gay equality in the church, as well as some conservative secular politics. A typical headline is: \u201cThe Depth of My Anger Over Decades of Effete Priests.\u201d\n\n[Alleged clergy sex abuse at prominent D.C. parish puts spotlight on religious orders]\n\nMichael Voris, a former television reporter who founded Church Militant in 2012, said the McCarrick case shifted his group\u2019s focus.\n\nVoris in 2016 released a video saying that for much of his 30s, he had multiple sexual relationships with men, including those with whom he lived. He portrayed himself as a victim of the devil.\n\nVoris said the McCarrick scandal \u2014 in which many top clergy in Rome and in the United States are alleged to have known of at least rumors that McCarrick was harassing male seminarians \u2014 merges with his followers\u2019 belief that a cabal of gay top clergy is at the core of church division.\n\n\u201cSince McCarrick, there is a lot more anger from faithful Catholics who feel like they\u2019ve been duped. They feel like they\u2019ve been lied to by the establishment,\u201d he told the Post.\n\nIt was hard for conservative Catholics to go after the establishment, Voris said, but \u201cnot anymore.\u201d\n\nThere was the feeling, he said: \u201c'Well, they\u2019re the successors of the apostle. We have to look at things in a charitable way,'\u201d he said. \u201cBut the fact that McCarrick was the one who ran the show, and he was covered up for \u2014 that was the last straw.\u201d\n\n[Christians should see in migrant caravan the Bible's call to honor the dignity of all people]\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time the survivors\u2019 movement has seen disagreement, said some long-term watchers. The key division decades ago, in the 1990s and early 2000s, they said, was more about tactics. Some groups like the Linkup, now faded, were focused on healing and care for survivors, while SNAP was more about confronting the church and publicizing crimes.\n\nIt\u2019s also not the first time the ultraconservative wing of the church was focused on the topic of abuse. Terry McKiernan, Barrett-Doyle\u2019s partner at BishopAccountability, said some of the most aggressive reporting on the issue in the 1980s and early 1990s was by the Wanderer, a 151-year-old Catholic newspaper whose motto is \u201cNo one can be at the same time a sincere Catholic and a true Socialist.\u201d Some of the earliest reporting on rumors of McCarrick\u2019s behavior with seminarians in the early 2000s appeared on conservative blogs.\n\nMcKiernan said liberals and conservatives tend to focus on abusers who fall in their opposing ideological camps but that he feels it has been \u2014 until now \u2014 harder for orthodox Catholics to display leadership on the issue.\n\n\u201cConservative Catholics didn\u2019t want any activism that seemed to be counter to the power structures of the church, which they respected and felt had doctrinal valiance,\u201d McKiernan said. \u201cMcCarrick gave them permission to be aggressive but still be thinking with the mind of the church.\u201d\n\nSome survivors and leaders at events in Baltimore said they see in 2018 a far greater level of interest in the topic of abuse among the typical churchgoing Catholic.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m seeing for the first time is we have Catholics joining us in droves. I have Catholic groups saying: \u2018What can we do for survivors?\u2019 \u201d Ianni said. While there was huge publicity in the early 2000s around the Boston crisis, the interest seemed to come and then go, as faithful Catholics believed the leadership that the problem was all cleaned up.\n\nThen came Chile. And Ireland. And the grand jury reports in Pennsylvania And Buffalo. And McCarrick. And more than a dozen state investigations into clergy sex abuse.\n\nIanni said lay Catholics may be \"realizing they are the church. Maybe for the first time, they\u2019re finding their voices.\u201d\n\nShaun Dougherty, a survivor originally from Johnstown, Pa., stood Monday with a sign outside the Baltimore Marriott. He said he believes it is now more comfortable for victims and advocates who speak out, but that\u2019s not enough.\n\n\u201cWe see so many tragedies today \u2014 Parkland, Las Vegas,\u201d he said, citing recent mass shootings. \u201cAnd people poured into the streets and marched for reforms. In Pennsylvania, we had wall-to-wall media coverage [of the grand jury report], and we couldn\u2019t even pack the [state] Capitol for reforms. The fact that parishioner support is not there is very hard to take.\u201d\n\nDougherty said the focus on celibacy or homosexuality as the solution is a distractions to the movement. \u201cThe Roman Catholic bishops have a serious problem with child molestation, and they are conferencing here to figure out how to get away with it,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of this other stuff bogs it down.\u201d", "BERLIN \u2014 German authorities said Tuesday they suspect a male nurse of killing six elderly patients, and attempting to kill at least three more, after he admitted to injecting them with diabetes medication.\n\nMunich police said the 36-year-old Polish man has acknowledged injecting 12 people in his care with unnecessary insulin shots from April 2017 until his arrest in February this year.\n\nThe suspect, previously identified as Grzegorz Stanislaw Wolsztajn, denies intending to kill them, police said. He is also being charged with three cases of serious bodily harm.\n\nWolsztajn worked for various Poland and Slovakia-based temp agencies in at least 68 locations across Germany since 2015, often staying only for short periods of time.\n\nThe suspect is alleged to have sought out vulnerable patients in order to steal their belongings. When he failed to find valuables he would quit his job and seek a new position elsewhere.\n\nPolice believe further crimes were averted by the man\u2019s arrest in February on suspicion of one killing, saying: \u201cThe accused already had new positions lined up.\u201d\n\nGerman authorities initially reached out to police in England amid concerns that Wolsztajn may also have committed crimes there.

(Jacques Demarthon/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe United States was notably absent from the list of more than 50 countries who signed an international agreement on cybersecurity principles revealed in Paris on Monday.\n\nBut American technology titans such as Microsoft, Google and Facebook signed the pact, a clear sign that companies are seeking to expand their role in shaping global cybersecurity policy.\n\nThe Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace unveiled by French President Emmanuel Macron outlines a commitment to end \u201cmalicious cyber activities in peacetime.\u201d But the non-binding agreement did not include buy-in from the most active cyber actors, including Australia, Russia, China, Iran, North Korea and Israel.\n\nYet this move to develop norms for the way countries should act in cyberspace was different from previous efforts because of the broad support from the private sector. More than 200 companies and business associations signed the agreement, which says major private-sector actors also have a responsibility to improve cybersecurity.\n\nThe agreement highlights how governments are now understanding -- and embracing -- the significant role companies can play in combating threats in cyberspace. And by signing agreements with governments worldwide, it's clear that American companies are becoming a global political force of their own.\n\n\n\nPeter Singer, a strategist and senior fellow at the think tank New America, said companies are increasingly banding together to address policy issues, especially because efforts in developing an international framework at the government level have floundered. \u201cThese agreements were in part a reaction to lack of government activity,\u201d Singer said.\n\nKlara Jordan, the director of the Cyber Statecraft Initiative at the Atlantic Council think tank, said this is the first agreement of its kind to include principles that address steps the government and private sector should take on cybersecurity. The Atlantic Council was one of almost 100 nongovernmental organizations that also signed the agreement. To address cybersecurity issues, \u201cyou need this multistakeholder kind of commitment,\u201d she said.\n\nCompanies are recognizing they have responsibilities beyond their business goals to protect people online, Jordan said. \u201cIndustry is taking a lead on it.\u201d\n\nAs one example, Microsoft has long been taking collective action with other companies to improve cybersecurity. Earlier this year, the company announced the Cybersecurity Tech Accord, a commitment of more than 60 technology and cybersecurity companies to improve the security of cyberspace. Last year, Microsoft President Brad Smith called for a \u201cdigital Geneva Convention\u201d to unite companies and governments in tackling cybersecurity issues.\n\nMicrosoft is escalating these efforts by signing the pact with other governments. \u201cWhile the tech sector has the first and highest responsibility to protect this technology and the people who rely upon it, this is an issue that requires that governments, companies and civil society come together,\u201d Smith said in a blog post. \u201cThat is the only effective way to protect people from what at times have become military-grade cybersecurity threats.\u201d\n\n\n\nOther technology leaders \u2014 such as Amazon and Apple \u2014 were not among the signatories. The companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment. (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\n\n\n\nThe Paris Call says that the rights people have offline must be upheld online, and that international human rights laws apply in cyberspace. All members of the European Union, as well as Japan, South Korea and other nations, signed on. \u201cWe condemn malicious cyber activities in peacetime, notably the ones threatening or resulting in significant, indiscriminate or systemic harm to individuals and critical infrastructure and welcome calls for their improved protection,\u201d the pact says.\n\nBut ultimately, the effort to set international norms on cybersecurity issues may fall short without buy-in from the major actors in cyberspace. Many of the states absent on the list have been more \u201caggressive\u201d and have pushed forward on offensive cyber operations, Singer said, adding that the absence of the United States creates bad optics. \u201cIt\u2019s not a good look for us to be on the outs and be aligned with China, Russia and North Korea on cyberspace issues.\"\n\nJordan also said the lack of U.S. participation was disappointing. \u201cIt is in my view a break with what happened in the past administrations, where norms were so important,\u201d she said.\n\nThis could make way for other players on the global stage. France and the United Kingdom, Jordan said, are now emerging as leaders in the push to develop international cybersecurity norms. But the absence of the United States also reflects the Trump administration\u2019s aversion to signing on to global pacts, instead favoring a transactional approach to issues, Singer said. He compared the U.S. absence on the cybersecurity pact to the Trump administration's withdrawal from the Paris agreement on climate change.\n\nThis approach was one reason the U.N.'s Group of Governmental Experts did not reach a consensus on international cyber laws, Singer said. Singer said the group fell apart in 2017, as the administration took a different approach to global norms and after Russia made an \u201cin-your-face violation\u201d with its hacking attempts on the U.S. presidential election and on Ukraine, highlighted by a 2015 attack on the country's electric grid.\n\nHowever, CyberScoop reported last month that the State Department was seeking to restart talks in the United Nations on global cyber norms.\n\nPINGED, PATCHED, PWNED\n\nPresident Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen at the White House in Washington on Oct. 10.

But Nielsen's ouster would also affect the federal government's cybersecurity policies since DHS oversees election security initiatives, critical infrastructure protection and other cybersecurity efforts.\n\nWhite House Chief of Staff John F.

For instance, it would be complicated to interfere in so many individual races throughout the country. Another possible explanation is that the Trump administration's cyber deterrence efforts may be working. \u201cStill a third possibility, experts say: Russian President Vladimir Putin, figuring he had successfully inflamed political divides and undermined confidence in American democracy, may have been content to kick back and watch others do the work for him,\u201d Volz and McMillan wrote.\n\nBut the midterm elections were held just last week, and as the Journal reported, \u201ccurrent and former officials cautioned that it may be too early to declare victory.

But it did not call for a halt to the repatriation plans.\n\nAmnesty International announced on Monday that it has withdrawn its highest honor from Suu Kyi because of her \u201cshameful betrayal of the values she once stood for.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday, we are profoundly dismayed that you no longer represent a symbol of hope, courage, and the undying defense of human rights. Amnesty International cannot justify your continued status as a recipient of the Ambassador of Conscience award and so with great sadness we are hereby withdrawing it from you,\u201d it said in a letter to Suu Kyi.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Jamey Keaten in Geneva contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Israelis were choosing their next mayors in dozens of locations across the country Tuesday, with the main focus on the largest city of Jerusalem. (Mahmoud Illean/Associated Press)\n\nJERUSALEM \u2014 Israelis were choosing their next mayors in dozens of locations across the country Tuesday, with the main focus on the largest city of Jerusalem.\n\nThe vote marks the second round of municipal elections in cities where no candidate secured at least 40 percent support in the Oct. 30 vote. The closest watched runoff race is in Jerusalem, Israel\u2019s proclaimed capital and a place of pilgrimage for billions around the world. While the city\u2019s mayor has little influence over Middle East politics and diplomacy, he presides over the day-to-day life in the hotbed of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and has a strong symbolic presence both nationally and internationally.\n\nThe polls were taking place amid the most serious violence between Israel and the Islamic militant Hamas, which rules the Gaza Strip, since they fought a 2014 war. An election in one regional council in southern Israel near the Gaza border was postponed because of the incessant rocket fire and the violence could drive down voter turnout in other locations near Gaza.\n\nJerusalem is Israel\u2019s poorest city. Its diverse population is split nearly evenly between Palestinians Arabs, ultra-Orthodox Jews and the rest of the Jewish residents \u2014 both secular and observant.\n\nWith the incumbent Nir Barkat stepping down to run for national office, a quartet of candidates squared off in an ugly campaign to replace him. The runoff features Moshe Lion, a longtime political fixture backed by much of the country\u2019s top leadership, facing off against Ofer Berkovitch, a young secular activist pushing a progressive agenda against religious hard-liners.\n\nLion, a former director general of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office in the 1990s, enjoys the support of key ultra-Orthodox factions and their representatives in government, as well as that of Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman and powerful figures in the ruling Likud party. But he has little grassroots support of his own and failed to place even a single representative in the municipal council.\n\nThe 35-year-old Berkovitch heads a joint group of secular and modern-Orthodox Jews that makes up the largest block of the incoming council. He has also been buoyed by a historic split in the ultra-Orthodox electorate, which did not vote en masse in the first round. Many leading rabbis have refrained from endorsing a final candidate and some Hassidic Jews, whose own hopeful failed to advance to the runoff, have vowed to vote for the secular Berkovitch \u2014 previously a seemingly improbable prospect.\n\nAvishai Cohen, who heads Berkovitch\u2019s ultra-Orthodox branch, says it\u2019s the result of vast changes in the community, with a younger generation more open to change and less reliant on the stringent all-encompassing edicts of rabbinical authorities. With many now joining the military and the modern workforce in growing numbers, he said it was natural they would also break out of their traditional voting patterns.\n\n\u201cThere is a groundswell toward real leadership,\u201d Cohen said at a makeshift campaign office where he tried to convince fellow ultra-Orthodox to vote for his candidate. \u201cI\u2019m here to show that there is another kind of ultra-Orthodox Jew.\u201d\n\nFew Palestinians vote since most consider participation as recognition of Israeli control over east Jerusalem, which Israel captured in the 1967 war and annexed in a move not recognized internationally. So the result will likely come down to ultra-Orthodox turnout and how many flip to Berkovitch\u2019s side.\n\nEither way, the winner is going to have to deal with deep divisions in the city after a hotly contested campaign.\n\n\u201cThe number one challenge is of course the diversity of the city. Jerusalem has a very unique demographic structure, therefore every mayor who is elected will have to find a way to embrace the other side,\u201d said Lior Schillat, the director general of the Jerusalem Institute for Policy Research, a non-partisan think-tank.\n\nElsewhere in Israel, runoffs will take place in Rishon Lezion, the country\u2019s fourth largest city, and several other major cities.\n\n____\n\nFollow Heller at www.twitter.com/aronhellerap\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Screen grab via Facebook)\n\nAt first, 14-year-old Brett Corbett told his mom he was sent to the principal\u2019s office sopping wet because the kids dared him to swim in the creek behind the school, in Glace Bay, Nova Scotia.\n\nBut then the videos emerged and with them, an appalling story of bullying.\n\nIn one video displayed with this article, Corbett, a high school freshman with cerebral palsy, is seen standing in the middle of shallow, murky water while more than a dozen kids stare down at him from the top of a small hill. He lies down on his stomach, keeping his palms flat in the mud to steady himself as the current rushes past him.\n\nThen, a moment later, a girl leaps from the bank, steps on Corbett\u2019s back as if it were a springboard, and launches herself to the other side \u2014 turning Corbett into a human bridge.\n\nIn another video, the teenagers are laughing hysterically. They yell at Corbett to get back in the water after he stands up. He doesn\u2019t want to.\n\n\u201cDo it, you f------ b----!\u201d one classmate screams, and Corbett did.\n\nCorbett\u2019s mother, Terri McEachern, said three students walked on her son.\n\nShe has not slept well since this happened to him last Wednesday. One of the videos has spread across Canada and much of the world, evoking shock and calls to stand up more strongly against bullying. A local boxer organized a \u201cStand for Brett Corbett\u201d rally outside Glace Bay High School to \u201cshow Brett he is never alone.\u201d Numerous messages of support have poured in for the 14-year-old.\n\nBut what has amazed McEachern most, she told The Washington Post, is her son\u2019s forgiveness. He didn\u2019t tell her the truth about what happened to him at first because he said he didn\u2019t want the other kids to get in trouble, she said. When she asked him whether he had been walked on after she watched the videos, he told her, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, I was already wet.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just breaking my heart. ... This is his mind-set,\u201d she said. \u201cChildren with disabilities have the most amazing gifts in the world. They don\u2019t see bad in anyone. They see so much good in everybody.\"\n\nMcEachern didn\u2019t find out what really happened to Corbett until a family friend saw one of the videos circulating on Snapchat and Instagram. He took his own video of the video and shared it with McEachern\u2019s older son \u2014 and on Facebook.\n\n\u201cNever in my LIFE have I ever been more disgusted,\u201d the friend, Brandon Jolie, wrote. \u201cEveryone who knows this boy knows he has a disability. How fricken hard is it to show some compassion??\"\n\nThe responses to Jolie\u2019s post poured in: \u201cHow insulting for this young man. A total lack of respect for those with a disability,\u201d one said.\n\n\u201cThey should be ashamed of themselves,\u201d said another.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the most disgusting things I have ever seen,\u201d another woman said.\n\nNever in my LIFE have I ever been more disgusted. The young boy in this video is my friends son, he has cerebral palsy. This is Glace Bay High School. Parents; you failed this generation. The amount of teenagers that stood around and watched this happen, even took videos of it. I hope you watch this video, recognize your kid and feel the shame. To the little girl that stepped on him; you should be absolutely ashamed of yourself. Everyone who knows this boy knows he has a disability. How fricken hard is it to show some compassion?? To stand by and not only allow it to happen but to take a video as if it's a joke! It's 2018, show some respect for eachother and empower eachother rather than claw other people down to build yourself up. I think we need to take this situation and make change out of it. We need to look at our children and the lessons we are teaching, we need to play a more active role in their social life. Stuff like this happens because we don't know what our kids are doing at school or with their friends. This needs to CHANGE. Posted by Brandon Jolie on Thursday, November 8, 2018\n\nMcEachern said some of the students involved were suspended for a single day \u2014 a response she has found terribly inadequate.\n\nShe wasn\u2019t the only one. About 20 students walked out of classes on Friday to protest what they described as the school\u2019s failure to take a firmer stand, the Cape Breton Post reported.\n\n\u201cHonestly, it\u2019s sickening,\u201d a 17-year-old junior told the paper. \u201cIt\u2019s a little upsetting to see nothing done about it.\u201d\n\nSchool administrators could not immediately be reached for comment by The Post, but a spokeswoman for the Cape Breton-Victoria Regional Centre for Education told the Cape Breton Post that the administration was taking the incident seriously and that it found the behavior \u201cunacceptable and very disappointing.\u201d The spokeswoman, Michelle MacLeod, also said police were investigating the incident, but she would not confirm or deny whether the students had been suspended, citing privacy reasons.\n\nSince the video went viral, some of the students seen on the videos at the creek have apologized. The father of one of them apologized on his son\u2019s behalf at a public meeting while reading from a letter in which the boy described his actions as \u201cthe worst decision of my life,\u201d CTV News reported.\n\nTwo other girls came with their parents to Corbett\u2019s house to tell him and his mother they were sorry. They each read aloud from their letters. The parents all cried. The girls cried. So did Corbett.\n\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have told you to go [into the water]. I should have helped you up instead of breaking you down,\u201d one of the girls began.\n\n\u201cYou are way stronger than me for being so forgiving so fast,\u201d she continued, \u201cand I\u2019m really sorry for what I have done. I know better. This is not who I am as a person. I truly care. I made a really bad choice and I will live with that for the rest of my life. I want with all my heart to make this better, and I can promise I will never let this happen to anyone again.\u201d\n\nReading from her letter, the girl said she thought Corbett was an \u201cawesome\u201d and \u201cinteresting\u201d person, but perhaps many of the kids at school didn\u2019t know that about him. She wanted to get to know him, she said, and she asked him, \u201cif you\u2019re up for it,\u201d whether they could be friends.\n\nCorbett said they could, and before long they were headed upstairs to play Xbox, McEachern said.\n\n\u201cThey said, \u2018I shouldn\u2019t have done this to you,\u2019 but he said, \u2018No, I\u2019m glad,\u2019\" McEachern remembered. \u201cHe said he was glad it happened to him, because maybe his story can make a difference.\u201d\n\nJolie said he has received comments from all over the world.\n\nPeople had their own stories to tell of friends or relatives who had been bullied. Mary Lou Levisky, 76, remembered her brother, who had cerebral palsy, and her \u201crecollections of children laughing in the street at him, constant comments from adults of what is wrong and parents who would not allow their daughters to come over and play at my house as they were afraid of my brother.\n\n\u201cI was horrified to learn via this incident that this behaviour still exists today. Congratulations to Brett and his many supporters for not taking it anymore. Seared in my brain are several incidents: my brother coming home from school with a sign in chalk on the back of his jacket, \u2018I am an idiot, punch me\u2019 placed there by male classmates.'\u201d\n\nMore from Morning Mix:\n\nAn American traveler vanished in Mexico.

At the Baghdad International Fair, Iran\u2019s ambassador says he wants to triple trade with Iraq. (Karim Kadim/Associated Press)\n\nBAGHDAD \u2014 At this year\u2019s Baghdad International Fair, Iranian businessmen displayed thick, colorful Persian rugs to impressed onlookers while others showcased the latest in Iranian manufacturing in power generators and industrial tools.\n\nFor Iranian companies, the annual Baghdad International Fair is a major event, as exporters in carpets, foodstuffs and heavy equipment look to score sales in Iraq\u2019s import-dependent economy.\n\nBut this year\u2019s edition, running this week, is an even bigger deal than usual: Iran, already feeling the bite of newly re-imposed unilateral U.S. sanctions, is turning to its neighbor to soak up its exports in agriculture, manufacturing and energy.\n\nAmbassador Iraj Masjedi promised Iran would grow its already flourishing trade with Iraq. The sanctions, he said, \u201cwill not affect the relations between the two countries.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump pulled the U.S. out of the 2015 nuclear deal that Iran struck with world powers in May. United Nations monitors say Iran still abides by the deal, in which it agreed to limit its uranium enrichment in return for the lifting of international sanctions.\n\nSince then, Trump announced what he billed the \u201ctoughest ever\u201d sanctions regime against Iran and the country has seen its oil exports plunge and its currency lose more than half its value. The full brunt of the measures came into effect Nov. 5 when the U.S. re-imposed oil and banking sanctions.\n\nHowever, other major economies including Europe, Russia and China have refused to take parallel measures, and Iran can still do business with the outside world.\n\nIraq is Iran\u2019s second largest export market. Since 2003, when the U.S. invasion plunged the country into civil war, Iraq has depended on Iran for everything from food to machinery, to electricity and natural gas.\n\nMasjedi boasted that trade between the two countries was on track to reach $8.5 billion this year and said Iran\u2019s outlook is to reach $22 billion annually -- more than triple its $7 billion in volume in 2017. He did not give specifics.\n\nNon-American companies are free to do business with Iran, so long as they do not also do business with the U.S., or through U.S. financial institutions.\n\n\u201cWe will not tie ourselves to the dollar,\u201d said Masjedi.\n\nMore than 60 Iranian companies are represented at the Baghdad fair, which runs until Nov. 19.\n\nMir Zad, director of Hisam, which sells generators and other electrical equipment, said he was aiming to secure deals worth around $1 million at the fair. He wasn\u2019t concerned about the new restrictions on the dollar; deals could be made in Iraqi dinar, he said.\n\nStill, a substantial portion of trade between the two nations is done in energy and cannot easily be structured outside the new sanctions regime.\n\nIt puts Iraq in a delicate position as a partner of both Washington and Tehran.\n\nWith its electricity sector in tatters, Iraq depends on Iranian gas and power generation to power its economy. A temporary electricity reduction last summer fueled unrest in Iraq\u2019s southern provinces.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Baghdad last Thursday announced it was granting Iraq a 45-day waiver to allow it to continue to purchase gas and electricity in Iraq.\n\nIt said the exception would give Iraq time to \u201ctake steps toward energy independence.\u201d\n\nBut it could take a year or longer to secure enough new power to make up for lost imports, said economist Bassim Jameel Antwan.\n\nIn the meantime, Iraq may have little choice but to continue to import from Iran. And Iran\u2019s deep entanglement in Iraq\u2019s political and military affairs further complicates the picture.\n\nIran has the ear of several of Iraq\u2019s top politicians and trains, finances and advises some of the largest militias in the country. While it is precisely this sort of influence the U.S. is aiming to curb, Iran can still play the role of spoiler in Iraqi politics.\n\n\u201cYou plan for one thing, and the result might be something else,\u201d said Antwan.\n\nSince May, Iran\u2019s currency the rial has sank in the black market from 60,000 to the dollar to 148,000 to the dollar. Oil exports fell from 2.5 million barrels per day in May to 1.85 billion in October and are expected to tumble some more.\n\n----\n\nAssociated Press writer Amir Vahdat contributed from Tehran.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(David Longstreath, File/Associated Press)\n\nBANGKOK \u2014 The death of a 13-year-old boy who was knocked out during a kickboxing match in Thailand has sparked debate over whether to ban matches involving children.\n\nThe death of Anucha Tasako came after a Muay Thai \u2014 Thai boxing \u2014 match Saturday in the Bangkok suburb of Samut Prakarn. The Facebook page Muaythai Krobwongjorn, which covers the sport, said he died from a brain hemorrhage. Protective gear is normally not worn in the sport, and video circulated on social media said to be of the fight shows Anucha not wearing any.\n\nChild boxing is widespread in Thailand, especially in rural areas, where it offers a way for children to help provide for their families and a path to lift them out of poverty, according to its advocates. Opponents say the sport is dangerous, citing studies such as one published last month by Thailand\u2019s Mahidol University saying that allowing children under 15 to box could result in various types of brain damage.\n\nThai lawmakers are considering legislation proposed last month banning children under 12 from competitive boxing. The legislation has been forwarded to the Ministry of Tourism and Sports, which has already drafted a revised version, said Gen. Aduldej Intapong, a member of the National Legislative Assembly.\n\nKickboxing is one of the most popular sports in Thailand and its boosters oppose regulating it.\n\n\u201cThis would have a major impact on the industry,\u201d Sukrit Parekrithawet, a lawyer who represents several boxing training camps, said of the proposed legislation. \u201cThose who drafted the law do not know anything about the sport of Thai boxing, and this would make Muay Thai become extinct.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t allow younger players to learn their way up, how can they be strong and experienced enough to fight?\u201d he said. \u201cWe call it \u2018boxing bones.\u2019 You need to have boxing bones built from a very young age.\u201d\n\nSukrit said the death of the 13-year-old, who fought under the name Petchmongkol S. Wilaitong, was a one-off incident and the result of a poorly organized event.\n\n\u201cThis has never happened before and it\u2019s unprecedented,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are several factors involved which have nothing to do with age. The referee wasn\u2019t quick enough to stop the fight and the venue didn\u2019t have a doctor on standby, which shouldn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nPublic television station ThaiPBS reported that Anucha had fought more than 170 matches since he began boxing at the age of 8, and was currently fighting in the under 41 kilogram (under 90 pound) weight division. It said he was raised by his uncle, who is a boxing trainer, after his parents separated.\n\nThe uncle, Damrong Tasako, told Thai PBS that Anucha\u2019s death was an accident but he would like to see regulations for children under 15 to wear protective gear to soften blows to the head and body.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

One week after the midterm elections, the outcome of several key votes is still unclear, which has triggered comparisons with the 2000 recount of Florida votes during the presidential election between George W. Bush and Al Gore.\n\nIt\u2019s likely that the uncertainty may drag on even longer than first estimated, as several counties have asked for extensions. Ballots mailed from abroad are being counted until Friday.\n\nBut Amalee McCoy\u2019s won\u2019t be among them.\n\nThe 42-year-old U.S. citizen who has lived abroad for almost three decades sent in her ballot from Thailand on Oct. 17, using registered mail. \u201cWe kept a copy of the tracking number as I was concerned about reports of voter suppression during early voting already happening in the news,\u201d said McCoy, who lives in Bangkok but votes in Osceola County, Fla. In previous years, voting from abroad posed few challenges, she said. But this year, things went differently.\n\n\u201cWhen [Nov. 5] rolled around, I started to wonder about if my ballot had been received,\u201d McCoy said. When she checked online, she saw that her vote had reached John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York on Oct. 25. It disappeared without a trace until Nov. 8. \u201cMy husband sent me a photo of my returned absentee ballot, that he had just received in the mail at our home in Bangkok,\u201d McCoy recalled. The reason? \u201cNot deliverable as addressed.\u201d\n\nMcCoy has shared her case with the Democrats Abroad in Thailand organization and has alerted local officials in the United States but says she has received no explanation of why her ballot never reached its destination.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m also a Thai citizen, and I find it highly ironic that I have more faith that my vote will be received, registered and counted in the upcoming national elections here in February,\u201d McCoy said. Thailand has hung in the balance between dictatorship and democracy in recent years.\n\nWith an estimated 2.6 million Americans living abroad who can vote, according to the Federal Voter Assistance Program, the broader question to many is why the United States makes it so hard for them to participate in elections. There are a number of challenges, including varying deadlines, delays in registrations and the risks of international mailing. Some try; others don\u2019t even bother.\n\nTo vote abroad as an American, you usually need to register and request an absentee ballot by downloading and filling out a form called \u201cFederal Post Card Application\u201d that is available on the Federal Voting Assistance Program\u2019s website. You\u2019ll probably have to print and return it by mail, though some states accept fax or email. At that point you are at the whim of your local postal service unless you want to spring for international fast delivery services or someone can hand-carry the ballot with them if they are heading to the United States (and can lend you the postage).\n\nNext, make sure that form has arrived at its destination. (If it hasn\u2019t, you may be able to obtain a federal write-in absentee ballot with the help of your embassy or consulate.) Then comes the crucial part of voting. Don\u2019t miss the deadlines. Allow plenty of time for the ballot to be mailed. And be prepared for surprises that may emerge in the process.\n\nTurnout among eligible Americans living abroad stood at only 4 percent in the 2014 midterms, compared with over 36 percent overall.\n\nOther countries do a better job.\n\nDuring the first round of presidential elections last year, a stunning 44 percent of French citizens living abroad cast their ballot. That\u2019s eight percentage points more than the overall turnout during the 2014 U.S. midterms.\n\n\n\nThe French National Assembly on Nov. 7. (Jacques Demarthon/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nFrance has come up with innovative solutions to make sure foreign voters aren\u2019t left behind, including the creation of political offices designed to represent citizens abroad. In 2010, the country created 11 foreign constituencies with their own representatives in the French Parliament. A French citizen last registered in Paris but living in London, for example, won\u2019t have to vote for a Parisian anymore but can instead choose a \u201cNorthern European\u201d French lawmaker who regularly travels there and has local offices across the region.\n\nRight now, that member of Parliament is Alexandre Holroyd, a politician aligned with President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s centrist party. \u201cThe democratic representation of the French community meets two objectives: First, it ensures that our citizens remain attached to our political community and concerned by our political life, making them our country\u2019s ambassadors everywhere in the world,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd second, it conveys a clear message: Political and civil rights are more than just about residency. They are about citizenship,\u201d Holroyd added.\n\nFrance\u2019s push to better represent citizens living abroad didn\u2019t pass without controversy, as some claimed that the new system would favor the conservative party. Those concerns turned out to be baseless, however, as votes ended up being more evenly shared than initially predicted. The benefit of having French members of Parliament for China or North America, for instance, is the inclusiveness of that approach. The message? We care about every vote, no matter who you are or where you live.\n\nBut there are more ways to increase international participation. While the United States does not allow its citizens to vote in embassies, many other Western nations, including France and Sweden, do. Interest was enormous during French presidential elections last year, with long lines of eager voters reported in front of some consulates and embassies.\n\nThousands showed up at a polling place in Montreal, forming a one-mile-long line. Photographers captured similar scenes at other French polling places around the world.\n\nSome Americans think it\u2019s time for the United States to replicate that approach. \u201cI definitely think that the U.S. should allow American citizens to vote at U.S. embassies,\u201d said McCoy, the Bangkok-based voter whose ballot never made it to Florida.\n\nWith a prior turnout of 4 percent, there isn\u2019t a lot to lose.\n\nMore on WorldViews:\n\nIs this the turning point for the war in Yemen?\n\nA couple denied being neo-Nazis.

(AP/AP)\n\nJoaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n, the famed Mexican drug lord known as \u201cEl Chapo,\u201d has spent the past 22 months in a small, windowless cell in Lower Manhattan awaiting trial. On Tuesday, at a federal district court in Brooklyn, that trial will finally start.\n\n\u201cThis is such an important case, because no single individual in Mexico is more responsible for the last decade of violence than Chapo Guzm\u00e1n,\u201d said David Shirk, a professor at the University of San Diego who focuses on Mexican politics and U.S.-Mexico border issues.\n\nSo why is Guzm\u00e1n standing trial in New York rather than in Mexico?\n\nMexico has certainly tried to bring Guzm\u00e1n to justice before, but he has twice escaped from maximum security prisons in his native country. During his imprisonment in 2001, he enlisted the help of the prison guards to sneak him to safety \u2014 hiding in a laundry cart, as the legend goes. He famously escaped again in 2015, breaking out of Mexico\u2019s most secure prison via a mile-long tunnel and evading capture for six months.\n\n[El Chapo trial begins: Drug kingpin faces life in prison]\n\n\u201cFrankly, Mexico\u2019s prison system has a long history of this sort of corruption and duplicity when it comes to drug-trafficking organizations because they\u2019re so powerful,\u201d said Eric Olson, deputy director of the Latin America program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.\n\nThe 2015 escape seemed to make Mexican authorities acknowledge that Guzm\u00e1n had the upper hand over their judicial system. The year before, then-Attorney General Jes\u00fas Murillo Karam had ruled out extraditing Guzm\u00e1n to the United States. \u201cEl Chapo must stay here to complete his sentence and then I will extradite him,\u201d Murillo said. \u201cSo about 300 or 400 years later \u2014 it will be a while.\"\n\nBut after Guzm\u00e1n was recaptured in 2016, Mexico sent him north to face trial. \u201cI think they recognized that there was weakness still in the system,\u201d Olson said. \u201cIt became a situation where the risks of extraditing him became less than the risks of not extraditing him,\u201d he added.\n\nShirk gave many reasons why trying Guzm\u00e1n in the United States would be different from trying him in Mexico: Guzm\u00e1n won\u2019t be able to run his operation from his prison cell the way he did in Mexico; judges and jury members are less likely to be intimidated or bribed into giving him a favorable ruling; and there are fewer legal tactics that could allow his lawyers to continually delay a trial.\n\nFor these reasons, the United States has a long history of trying criminals when other countries' judicial systems lack the resources or ability to do so. But not everyone thinks extradition is the best long-term solution for bringing criminals to justice.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been the prison system of last resort for the Western Hemisphere, and that absolves these countries of the responsibility to take care of their own problems,\u201d Shirk said. \u201cIt\u2019s in our interest to do so because many of these people are committing crimes against the United States, but arguably the hemisphere would be better off if the rule of law were stronger in all of these individual countries.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nMexican drug lord Joaqu\u00edn \u2018El Chapo\u2019 Guzm\u00e1n extradited to U.S.\n\nResidents in a Mexican neighborhood miss the cartel that protected them", "Were Tuesday\u2019s election results the \u201cblue wave\u201d Democrats were hoping for? Democrats won control of the House of Representatives and won seven governorships. But even with Senate outcomes still unclear in Arizona and Florida, Democrats lost several seats in the Senate, and their gains in state legislative chambers were below the historical average.\n\nStill, Nate Cohn of the New York Times estimated that the Democrats\u2019 national popular vote was likely to be as high or higher than \u201cwave\u201d elections of 1994, 2006 and 2010. Looking at only House races, Dave Wasserman of the Cook Political Report wrote that it was a \u201cpowerful, if uneven wave.\u201d Still others point to Senate Democratic wins in red states such as Montana and West Virginia and Democrats\u2019 success in beating several incumbents in suburban GOP strongholds across the country.\n\nWhat precisely is a \u201cwave\u201d election? Here are four things to know about evaluating electoral waves.\n\n1. There\u2019s no consensus measure\n\nAfter the 2014 election, I identified no fewer than nine definitions of a congressional wave election. Some used the net number of seats that switched from one party to another, a measure known as the net partisan seat swing. Others narrowly focused on a party\u2019s performance in either toss-up races or races in which a party\u2019s candidates were not expected to win. Still other approaches judged whether the electoral outcomes reflected a dominant national issue or an opportunity to alter the political status quo.\n\n[These 5 charts explain who voted how in the 2018 midterm elections]\n\nThe least consistent definitions of a wave are based on individual races, surprise outcomes or switches in partisan control of legislative chambers. While popular, they should be avoided, since they seldom consider whether those outcomes are historically unusual.\n\nWashington Post reporter Colby Itkowitz examines how these competing definitions of a wave election lead to contradictory conclusions about the 2018 elections. On one hand, she notes, some have insisted it was a wave because of several upsets; the defeats of high-profile Republicans such as Kris Kobach and Scott Walker; and the near-loss of Republican Ted Cruz in Texas. But others insist the opposite, pointing to Democratic losses in the Senate and the failure of high-profile candidates such as Beto O\u2019Rourke to win election.\n\n2. Benchmarking against history is important\n\nIf we want a more rigorous definition of a wave, it should account both for actual election outcomes and for the size of a party\u2019s success compared to some historical benchmark. For legislative elections, a good option is to compare net partisan seat swings to past elections. That measure captures an election\u2019s relative impact on legislative politics, since the number of seats a party holds \u2014 not the number of votes it received \u2014 shapes a party\u2019s agenda and influence.\n\nBy this measure, 2018 offers a mixed picture. Since 1902, the historical midterm average House seat gain for the party that does not occupy the White House is 31. House Democrats in 2018 will probably gain 35 to 38 seats when all the counting is done. That suggests a House wave for the Democrats.\n\n[Here are 4 things to expect from a new, Trumpier, more polarized Congress]\n\nBut in their analysis of elections dating to 1918, Rob Oldham and Jacob Smith argue that a wave election is one in which the out-party\u2019s seat gain ranks among the top 20 percent of all seat swings over the past century. Oldham and Smith calculate that it would take a much larger swing in the House \u2014 48 seats \u2014 to reach that threshold. There aren\u2019t enough undecided House races left that lean Democratic, even slightly, for that to happen this year.\n\n3. Politicians claim they know a wave when they see one\n\nDefining a wave election is not merely academic. As RealClearPolitics staffer Sean Trende has noted, politicians frequently cite electoral waves to claim a voter mandate for bold policy action or to rebuke an opposite-party president. Would Republicans have so zealously tried to enact the Contract With America in 1995, or repeal Obamacare in 2011, had they not interpreted the previous election as a GOP wave?\n\nThe lack of consensus about how to define a wave election may encourage politicians to define it as it suits them. In the wake of this week\u2019s election, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) claimed victory, while President Trump insisted he had \u201cstopped the blue wave.\u201d\n\n4. Elections matter, wave or not\n\nOf course, the debate over what counts as a wave misses the point: Elections may shape national and state policymaking, no matter how big or small a particular party\u2019s win or loss.\n\nFor instance, because of last week\u2019s elections, congressional Democrats will be able to hold hearings and conduct investigations into the Trump White House. The elections weakened the GOP\u2019s influence in state-level governance, which will make it harder for Republicans to control redistricting after the 2020 census. Meanwhile, the Senate GOP maintained its ability to confirm the president\u2019s nominations of federal judges and high-level bureaucrats. And the elections increased the diversity of the country\u2019s elected leadership.\n\nThese are significant consequences of the 2018 election, whether it was a wave or a ripple.\n\nMatthew Green (@mattngreen) is a professor of politics at Catholic University and the author of \u201cUnderdog Politics: The Minority Party in the U.S. House of Representatives\u201d (Yale University Press, 2015).", "\n\nA late March snowstorm hits the Washington, D.C., region. (Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post)\n\nSummer seemed to last forever and fall has been fleeting. Our first chance of wintry precipitation is already here and the winter season itself is just a few weeks away.\n\nAs such, it\u2019s time we present our annual winter outlook.\n\nThe last two winters didn\u2019t feature much winter. The winter of 2016-2017 was abnormally warm and practically snowless. Last winter showed more signs of life, with a punishing Arctic blast in late December and early January and then a cold March capped by a snowstorm on spring\u2019s first day. But, overall, it was still milder than average.\n\nWinter will try to make a comeback in 2018-2019.\n\nA snowier than average result for the first time since 2015-2016\n\nThis winter we\u2019re predicting somewhat above average snowfall, to the tune of 18 to 24 inches inside the Beltway and up to 30 inches or so in our normally colder areas to the north and west.\n\n\n\n(The Washington Post Staff/Washington, D.C.)\n\nWe predict February will be the snowiest month, perhaps followed by March, as a more entrenched and persistent wintry pattern tries to emerge. Additionally, we think the chance of a significant snowstorm \u2014 8 to 12 inches or even more \u2014 is higher than normal\n\nOverall, we\u2019re forecasting seven or eight accumulating snow events in the immediate D.C. metro area, with a couple more in our colder suburbs to the north and west. This doesn\u2019t include dustings or ice events, as we are likely to have some of those, too.\n\nA late blooming winter, trending colder into February\n\nAlthough we favor snowy conditions, we don\u2019t think it will be brutally cold. We haven\u2019t had a cold winter in four years (since 2014-2015) and lean toward slightly warmer than average conditions this year.\n\nBut you may notice the winter turning more intense with time. We\u2019re forecasting December and January to end up somewhat warmer than average. That said, weather patterns don\u2019t abide by a monthly calendar, and a flip to a colder and snowier period is very possible in mid- to late January. February should be decidedly cold and, if that verifies, it will be the first colder than average February since 2015.\n\nGiven the prospects for a cold March, this winter may seem quite long.\n\nOutlook details\n\nTemperatures\n\nOverall, we expect temperatures for December through February (relative to 1981-2010 normals) to finish near to slightly above average (average to one degree above average).\n\nHere is the month by month breakdown:\n\nDecember: Three to four degrees warmer than average\n\nJanuary: Two degrees warmer than average\n\nFebruary: Three to four degrees colder than average\n\nMarch: We don\u2019t make specific predictions for March, but we do predict it to be colder than average.\n\nSnowfall\n\nOur snowfall projection covers November through April (1981-2010 statistics in parentheses). Overall, we expect slightly to somewhat above average snowfall.\n\nHere are the predicted snow amounts, by location:\n\nAlexandria, Arlington and Prince George\u2019s counties and the District: 18-24 inches\n\nFairfax, Loudoun, Montgomery counties: 22-32 inches\n\nReagan National Airport (DCA): 16-20 inches (compared with a 15.4-inch average, 11 inch median)\n\nDulles International Airport (IAD): 24-30 inches (compared with a 22.0 inch average, 16 inch median)\n\nBaltimore-Washington International Marshall Airport (BWI): 22-28 inches (compared with a 20.1 inch average, 15 inch median)\n\n\n\n(The Washington Post)\n\nQualifiers\n\nWhile advances have been made in seasonal forecasting, there is still a great deal of uncertainty and limited skill in developing these outlooks. This is a low-confidence forecast.\n\nNote that monthly temperature predictions are less reliable than for the whole season. A cold or warm pattern lingering a week too long or ending a week short can greatly alter a monthly average. Furthermore, it takes only one big snowstorm for us to near or exceed our seasonal average.\n\nCommon questions and answers\n\nWhat are other outlets forecasting for our area?\n\nWithout exception, forecasters in the private sector, including TV forecasters, consulting meteorologists and major weather companies, are predicting a snowier than average winter in Washington. We reviewed nine independent outlooks and all of their forecasts fall in the range of 15 to 35 inches of snow, compared to the average of 15 inches, with the majority in the 20- to 30-inch range.\n\nMost of the outlooks predict colder-than-average temperatures although a few call for near-average.\n\n[Summary of TV forecaster outlooks | Summary of other private sector outlooks]\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s outlook from the government does not issue a snowfall forecast, but favors above normal precipitation and near-average temperatures.\n\n[Summary of NOAA winter outlook]\n\nHow have your winter outlooks performed in past years?\n\nWe have been doing winter outlooks since 2005-2006 and have evaluated ourselves after the fact for the past 12 winters. We\u2019ve generally been in the ballpark, giving ourselves an average grade around a B- or C+, although we\u2019ve had notable triumphs and misses.\n\nOur outlook for last winter was pretty good. We correctly called for slightly warmer than average conditions and below average snowfall \u2014 although we missed on some of the month-to-month specifics.\n\nOur best winter forecast preceded the record-breaking Snowmageddon winter (2009-2010) when we said: \u201cOverall, we find chances for a large snowstorm of 8-12 inches or more are much higher than normal this coming winter.\u201d Our outlook for the winter of 2014-2015 was also quite successful, as we correctly called for it to be cold with somewhat above normal snow.\n\nOur worst outlooks were for the winters of 2011-2012 and 2013-2014. In 2011-2012, we called for near normal temperatures and it was 5 degrees warmer than normal. Four winters ago (2013-2014), we called for a warm winter with slightly below normal snow and it was cold, with snow more than twice the average.\n\n\n\nPeople gather on the banks of the tidal basin to check out cherry blossom trees covered by a spring snow fall in Washington on March 21. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nMethodology\n\nBelow are some, though not all, of the factors that we considered in determining conditions for this upcoming winter.\n\nNo single factor tells the whole story, nor are the correlations between past conditions and future conditions \u2014 which we used to inform the outlook \u2014 always strong. But we have chosen factors that in the past as a guide, have proven to have at least some predictive value. And when considered collectively, they help paint a picture of what we believe is most likely to happen this winter.\n\nNo two winters are alike, but we expect this winter to share some similarities with the winters of 1913-14 and 1923-24. These analogs helped to very loosely form the basis of our temperature and snow predictions because the weather in those years had some similarities to the factors below.\n\nTropical Pacific Ocean\n\nWe are likely currently experiencing the infancy of a weak to moderate El Ni\u00f1o event that should persist throughout the winter, and perhaps beyond. El Ni\u00f1o is a phenomenon in the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean in which ocean temperatures are warmer than normal. In recent weeks, ocean temperatures in this region have warmed significantly.\n\n\n\nAnimation of sea surface temperatures from normal over time in the tropical Pacific Ocean. (NOAA)\n\nOne thing that most weak to moderate El Ni\u00f1o events have in common is periods where the subtropical jet stream is active. An active subtropical jet stream is indicated by storm systems hitting the California coast and traversing across the southern half of the United States. Often these storms will come up the East Coast and produce snow, but even when they don\u2019t, we are frequently far enough south in latitude to be affected.\n\n\n\n(The Washington Post)\n\nIt is often during the second half of El Ni\u00f1o when the subtropical jet stream is most active and we expect the greatest chance of meaningful snow events.\n\nThat said, the northern (polar) branch of the jet stream can still assert dominance at times, especially in weaker El Ni\u00f1o events. When the northern stream is dominant, the prevailing storm track shifts to our west. When storms track to our west, they tend to draw warm and sometimes dry air over our region. When it does snow in these situation, a flip to sleet or rain is common.\n\n\n\n(The Washington Post)\n\nAll other things being equal, El Ni\u00f1o tends to slightly favor above normal snowfall in Washington, but more for moderate events than for the weak and strong. This event is predicted to straddle the line between weak and moderate.\n\n[Are El Ni\u00f1os a sure bet for a heavy snowfall? Maybe.]\n\nNorth Pacific Ocean\n\nThe Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) is a measurement of the intensity and location of sea-surface temperature differences from normal in the North Pacific. When it is strongly positive, it often correlates with a cold and stormy pattern for the Mid-Atlantic. When it is sharply negative, conditions often, but not always, trend warm and dry.\n\nAfter a multiyear persistent positive PDO period, we are experiencing a more neutral period. Often, though not always, El Ni\u00f1o events tend to have a strengthening effect on the PDO toward the positive phase. As such, we think the PDO will average slightly above normal for the winter, but less so than in El Ni\u00f1o winters that occur during more positive PDO periods.\n\n\n\nThe Pacific Decadal Oscillation over time. (NOAA)\n\nA positive PDO often correlates with a zone of high pressure or ridge over western Canada (and sometimes up to and north of Alaska), and a downstream area of low pressure or dip in the jet stream over the southeastern United States. A ridge in western Canada is a good mechanism for delivering cold into the eastern United States.\n\nArctic Oscillation (AO) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)\n\nThe AO is a measurement of surface air pressure difference from normal at the high latitudes over and north of Greenland. Pressures lower than normal indicate the positive phase, and pressures higher than normal, the negative phase.\n\nDuring the positive phase of the AO, cold air is characteristically locked up over the Arctic by a strong polar vortex, and the mid-latitudes tend to be mild. In the negative phase of the AO, the polar vortex becomes disturbed, and cold air outbreaks become more likely over the mid-latitudes, including the United States.\n\n\n\nJet stream pattern during the positive AO (left) and negative AO (right) (University of Washington)\n\nThe AO\u2019s cousin, the NAO is technically a measurement of the differences in air pressure over the North Atlantic Ocean. It is often indicated by either an upper-level low pressure area (positive phase) or upper-level high pressure area (negative phase) over or near Greenland. Often, though not always, the AO and NAO share the same phase, especially when averaged over the course of the winter.\n\nA negative AO in the winter months often correlates with a cold pattern in our region, and supports winter storms when other factors align with it, particularly when we have a negative NAO as well. This was the major factor in our historically snowy winter of 2009-10.\n\nHigh pressure over Greenland or high-latitude blocking helps push the storm track farther south and east, often creating storm tracks that are cold and snowy for our region. While a negative AO and NAO combination far from guarantees a cold and snowy period, our chances of a meaningful snow event are much greater than without it.\n\n\n\n(The Weather Channel)\n\nOn the other hand, a positive AO and NAO combination typically supports a warmer pattern, with a storm track that will often go to our west.\n\nWe predict the AO and NAO will average slightly above normal this winter, which will somewhat limit windows in which the storm track and available cold air are favorable for snow. That said, we expect there will be a window from late January to early March in which both indices go sharply negative, enhancing our chance for snow events.\n\nOther factors considered\n\n2018 will be one of our wettest years on record. We expect this wet pattern to persist, particularly since El Ni\u00f1o events often lend themselves to wetter than normal conditions anyway. Consequently, we expect precipitation to average above normal for the winter, which tilts the odds for snowier conditions.\n\nCapital Weather Gang\u2019s Ian Livingston contributed to this outlook.\n\nPast outlooks\n\n2017-2018 winter outlook recap\n\n2017-2018 winter outlook\n\n2016-2017 winter outlook recap\n\n2016-2017 winter outlook\n\n2015-2016 winter outlook recap\n\n2015-2016 winter outlook\n\n2014-2015 winter outlook recap\n\n2014-2015 winter outlook\n\n2013-2014 winter outlook recap\n\n2013-2014 winter outlook\n\n2012-2013 winter outlook\n\n2012-2013 winter outlook recap\n\n2011-2012 winter outlook\n\n2011-2012 winter outlook recap\n\n2010-2011 winter outlook\n\n2010-2011 winter outlook live chat\n\n2010-2011 winter outlook recap\n\n2009-2010 winter outlook\n\n2009-2010 winter outlook recap\n\n2008-2009 winter outlook\n\n2008-2009 outlook live chat\n\n2008-2009 winter outlook recap\n\n2007-2008 winter outlook\n\n2007-2008 winter outlook recap\n\n2007-2008 winter outlook\n\n2006-2007 winter outlook\n\n2005-2006 winter outlook", "In this courtroom sketch, Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, surrounded by U.S. Marshals, waves to his wife Tuesday as he enters the courtroom at Brooklyn Federal Court. (Elizabeth Williams/AP)\n\nBy prosecutors\u2019 account, Joaqu\u00edn Archivaldo Guzm\u00e1n Loera, better known as \u201cEl Chapo,\u201d was a man whose ruthlessness was surpassed perhaps only by his efficiency. Starting out selling marijuana in Mexico, Guzm\u00e1n built a fearsome narcotics empire, revolutionizing the way drugs make their way from Colombia and zealously rooting out anyone whom he perceived to stand in his way.\n\nThe way defense attorneys tell it, Guzman, 61, is a scapegoat, whose \u201cmythological\u201d status is essentially a creation of the Mexican, U.S. and other governments looking to distract from corruption in their own ranks involving other, more serious narco-traffickers.\n\nJurors heard those opening pitches in federal court here in Brooklyn on Tuesday.\n\nGuzman, dressed in a suit and tie, shook each of his attorneys\u2019 hands as he entered the courtroom and gave a slight wave to the judge. Even as prosecutors detailed the cocaine and other drugs they say he sold, and the killings they say he carried out, he sat passively amid his lawyers at a long row of wooden tables, occasionally tilting his ear toward an interpreter.\n\nHis staid appearance belied the fact that those who came to watch the proceedings had to put their belongings twice through security scans \u2014 and pass two metal detectors and bomb detecting dogs. Guzman has twice escaped from Mexican prisons, and authorities fear his four-month trial might give him an opportunity for mischief.\n\nGuzm\u00e1n, who faces the possibility of life in prison, has been held in solitary confinement in one of New York City\u2019s most fearsome prisons \u2014 the frosted glass in his cell providing light but no view of the outside world. Jurors will be escorted to and from the courthouse by U.S. Marshals \u2014 their identities, like some witnesses in the case, kept secret out of fear they could face retaliation. One juror dropped out Tuesday, citing anxiety, and attorneys spent most of the day selecting new alternates. Multiple people expressed fear about serving on the jury.\n\nAt the end of the morning session, Guzman appeared to be disoriented and almost followed the last juror out of the courtroom and into the jury room. An attentive marshal put out his arm to stop him, and Guzman was then directed through the proper door and into his holding cell.\n\n[How \u2018El Chapo\u2019 was finally captured]\n\nProsecutors began their case by laying out Guzman\u2019s decades-longhistory with the drug trade. Assistant U.S. Attorney Adam Fels traced how Guzman started by selling marijuana in Mexico, building tunnels under the border with the United States to facilitate his business and establishing relationships with Colombian cartels for his supply. He was soon using all sorts of delivery mechanisms, earning himself the nickname \u201cEl Rapido\u201d for the efficiency with which he was able to move cocaine and marijuana.\n\nHis success, though, attracted the attention of both rivals and authorities, and in 1993, Guzman fled to Guatemala, where he was arrested and brought back to his own country. Even from prison, Fels said, Guzman was able to run his empire, and in 2001, when he learned the United States might seek to extradite him, he engineered an escape in a prison laundry cart.\n\nA free man throughout the 2000s, he waged bloody wars with rival factions over control of Mexican cities \u2014 issuing a \u201cstanding order\u201d for his allies to kill those who opposed him, Fels said. He was not afraid to get his hands dirty, Fels said, adding that jurors will hear how Guzman, in one instance, pulled the trigger during a killing, and told those who worked for him to dispose of a body. In another instance, Guzman ordered the murder of a cousin, whom he suspected of cooperating with authorities, Fels said.\n\n\n\nIn this 2017 photo, U.S. authorities escort Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, center, from a plane to a waiting caravan of SUVs at Long Island MacArthur Airport, in Ronkonkoma, N.Y. (AP/AP)\n\nEventually, Guzman was apprehended, but escaped again in 2015 \u2014 this time by making his way through a tunnel that workers had dug directly into the shower in his cell from an abandoned home more than a mile away, Fels said.\n\n[Undermining Mexico: How \u2018El Chapo\u2019 built a criminal empire \u2014 and escaped prison \u2014 by digging deep]\n\nHe was recaptured in 2016, after a meeting with actor Sean Penn helped lead authorities to his hiding spot near the coast in northwestern Mexico, but Fels said before his extradition to Brooklyn the following year, \u201cGuzman was planning yet another escape from Mexican custody.\u201d\n\nIn a fiery counter to Fels, Jeffrey H. Lichtman, one of Guzman\u2019s defense attorneys, said the notion that Guzman was the world\u2019s most prolific narco-trafficker was \u201cfalse,\u201d and said the case will show that governments \u2014 including \u201cAmerican law enforcement agents\u201d \u2014 can be corrupted.\n\nLichtman took aim at the credibility of prosecutors\u2019 cooperating witnesses \u2014 who claim to have worked under Guzman and who are expected to describe the inner workings of his organization \u2014 calling them \u201cgutter human beings\u201d and \u201cpeople will who will make your skin crawl.\u201d He also questioned why the government would have given them plea deals that might allow them to walk free.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s because the conviction of Chapo Guzman is the largest prize that this prosecution could ever dream of,\u201d Lichtman said.\n\nFels said prosecutors would have evidence to support the witnesses inside of Guzman\u2019s organization, including intercepted phone calls and text messages, as well as written letters and drug ledgers. Licthman, whose opening statement is expected to continue Wednesday, did not address that. Rather, he broadly framed Guzman as a victim of a government conspiracy.\n\nLichtman said a DEA agent wrote in an email that Guzman was \u201cmore myth than an actual legend,\u201d and that while Guzman fostered the public narrative about his life, it was largely overhyped. He alleged that Guzman was framed for the 1993 murder of a Catholic cardinal who died in a shootout outside the Guadalajara airport \u2014 a crime Fels alleged was carried out by the Mexican government \u2014 and that Guzman was afraid corrupt Mexican officials would try to kill him while he was in prison. That, Licthman said, helps explain his escapes.\n\n\u201cHe knew he would be killed if he stuck around,\u201d Lichtman said.\n\nLichtman also accused the Mexican government, including its current and past president, of accepting bribes from another alleged drug lord, Ismael \u201cEl Mayo\u201d Zambada, who prosecutors cast as a partner of Guzman\u2019s, and asserted that Zambada\u2019s brother and two sons were cooperating with prosecutors. Lichtman suggested the focus on Guzman might be to distract from Zambada.\n\n\u201cYou figure it out,\u201d he said.\n\nA spokesman for Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto said on Twitter that Lichtman\u2019s allegations were false, as did former president Felipe Calder\u00f3n.", "CAIRO \u2014 An Egyptian court has sentenced a policeman to three years in prison and another to six months over the killing of a detainee in custody, relatively light sentences that prompted a backlash on social media.\n\nThe Cairo Criminal Court convicted the two of beating Mohamed Abdel-Hakim to death in a police station in Cairo\u2019s Mokattam neighborhood in January. But it said he was killed by mistake during an interrogation and did not charge the policemen with torture.\n\nThe verdict, which was announced Sunday, can be appealed.\n\nThe killing outraged area residents, who set a police car ablaze, hurled stones and tried to storm the police station.

But in reality, it was, at times, a bizarre interview that went far beyond a discussion of his experience as the beloved host of one of television\u2019s longest-running trivia game shows.\n\nThe Q&A, which Vulture noted had been edited and condensed from two conversations, was published Monday and pinballed erratically between a number of topics.

Taking a shot at Trump, Trebek said the president doesn\u2019t make jokes but rather \u201cpicks on people.\u201d When he was asked later how Trump would do on \u201cJeopardy!,\u201d Trebek quipped, \u201cHe might not agree that any of the correct responses are correct.\u201d\n\nTrebek has not met Trump, but he did once spend \u201calmost an hour\u201d with Trudeau \u2014 and he had a very interesting story about the encounter.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m keenly aware of little nuances,\u201d Trebek said, \u201cand I noticed at one point, after about 45 minutes, that Justin did something like this [scratches under his shirt], and about ten seconds later, there was a knock on the door and one of his assistants came in and said, \u2018Mr. Prime Minister, you have a meeting.\u2019 \u201d\n\nUnderstandably, Marchese was confused, so Trebek elaborated.\n\n\u201cHe has a buzzer under his shirt that he can use to signal his assistants when it\u2019s time to come and get him,\u201d he said of Trudeau.\n\nAmatulli, the HuffPost reporter, summed up a majority of people\u2019s reactions to that factoid in one word: \u201cWHAT.\u201d\n\nOn Twitter, another user wrote, \u201cWe have ruined alex trebek. he is haunted by buzzers. he believes everyone he meets has a buzzer they use to deceive him.\u201d\n\nwe have ruined alex trebek. he is haunted by buzzers. he believes everyone he meets has a buzzer they use to deceive him pic.twitter.com/bpSZYFfEOH \u2014 Hayes Davenport (@hayesdavenport) November 12, 2018\n\nOn Twitter, Gerald Butts, Trudeau\u2019s principal secretary, set the record straight.\n\n\u201cNot true, but not the worst idea I\u2019ve ever heard,\u201d Butts wrote. \u201cAlso, Alex Trebek is a national treasure.\u201d\n\nWhy then did Trebek believe Trudeau had a hidden buzzer? One Twitter user floated a theory.\n\n\u201cAlex Trebek has spent the bulk of his professional life around buzzers he cannot use and must obey,\u201d the person wrote. \u201cPerhaps it has driven him insane and he now believes buzzers are responsible for everything that happens in the world.\u201d\n\nWith more than 30 years of experience hosting \u201cJeopardy!,\u201d Trebek also spoke extensively about the game show itself, namely how he thinks it should be played \u2014 no jumping all over the board, a strategy known as the \u201cForrest Bounce\u201d pioneered by Chuck Forrest in 1985.\n\n\u201cWhat bothers me is when contestants jump all over the board even after the Daily Doubles have been dealt with,\u201d Trebek said. \u201cWhy are they doing that? They\u2019re doing themselves a disservice. When the show\u2019s writers construct categories they do it so that there\u2019s a flow in terms of difficulty, and if you jump to the bottom of the category you may get a clue that would be easier to understand if you\u2019d begun at the top of the category and saw how the clues worked.\u201d\n\nTrebek added: \u201cI like there to be order on the show, but as the impartial host I accept disorder.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if there was a formula to winning \u201cJeopardy!,\u201d Trebek had a simple answer: \u201cYeah, know the material.\u201d\n\nAnd if you miss an easy question?

(Alfredo Estrellad/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nMedia coverage of the migrant caravan that moved through Guatemala in October diminished after the U.S. midterms \u2014 at least until Saturday\u2019s new interim rule by the Trump administration to \u201cchannel inadmissible aliens to ports of entry,\u201d with those crossing illegally ineligible to apply for asylum.\n\nMany of these migrants heading toward the United States are fleeing violence and gangs in their countries. What would help make them feel safe to remain in Central America? A new study by the International Crisis Group on Guatemala provides some answers.\n\nOver the past decade more than 120,000 people in Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala have been killed. Criminal gangs, legacies of civil war and corruption have pushed violence levels higher despite the \u201ctough on crime\u201d policies of the region\u2019s governments, driving ever-higher rates of forced migration north to Mexico and the United States, including this fall\u2019s caravan.\n\nGuatemala has reduced the homicide rate\n\nIn Guatemala, however, changes spurred by the International Commission Against Impunity \u2014 known by its Spanish acronym CICIG \u2014 have achieved what was once thought impossible: major reductions in the country\u2019s homicide rate. A new report estimates that the changes associated with the CICIG have avoided more than 4,500 homicides in Guatemala from 2007-2017 \u2014 an extraordinary feat.\n\n[How deporting immigrants from the U.S. increases immigration to the U.S.]\n\nThese results bring into sharp relief Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales\u2019s endeavors to curtail the CICIG\u2019s mandate in 2019. Ending or substantially weakening the CICIG would be a major step backward for Guatemala and the region. And the evidence implies that neighboring Honduras and El Salvador could greatly benefit from similar justice changes.\n\nHow Guatemala changed course\n\nGuatemala\u2019s trajectory looked similar to its neighbors. From 2000 to 2006, the murder rate nearly doubled; in 2006, 93 percent of homicides went unsolved. A U.N. report that year pointed out the rampant impunity for serious crimes meant that Guatemala was \u201ca good place to commit a murder.\u201d\n\nOrganized criminal groups \u2014 descendants of the 1990s-era counterinsurgent cells that fought the nation\u2019s civil war and developed major illicit interests in the process \u2014 exploited a weak justice system. Connected to and protected by the highest levels of government, they could engage with impunity in corruption, racketeering, and human and drug trafficking.\n\n[Is Russia interfering in Guatemala\u2019s anti-corruption commission? The real story might surprise you.]\n\nBut 2007 was a turning point. Urged by civil society, the Guatemalan congress authorized a unique U.N.-backed justice change to reduce the impunity of postwar organized criminal groups. The CICIG, which attracted more than $150 million in international support over the past decade, helped to radically restructure the justice sector in Guatemala. It has promoted basic investigative coordination between law enforcement and prosecutors, built capacity in the Public Ministry, and pursued and won convictions for massive high-level corruption within the government. From 2006 to 2013, the homicide clearance rate went from 7 percent to 28 percent.\n\nGuatemala\u2019s president has pushed back\n\nBut President Jimmy Morales and other politicians have questioned the premise of the CICIG, arguing that the international commission grossly violates Guatemalan sovereignty. Morales\u2019s scrutiny of the CICIG coincided with corruption investigations that breached his inner circle, including an accusation that his presidential campaign accepted at least $1 million in illegal contributions.\n\nRecently, Morales announced that he would seek to end the CICIG\u2019s mandate in 2019 and blocked CICIG Commissioner Iv\u00e1n Vel\u00e1squez from entering Guatemala. In the United States, historically a staunch supporter of the CICIG, some officials have publicly soured on the CICIG, citing fears of Russian and Venezuelan interference \u2014 fears that later were debunked.\n\n[Here\u2019s what social science tells us about that migrant \u2018caravan\u2019 \u2014 and the Trump administration\u2019s response]\n\nHow effective has the CIGIG been?\n\nHas the CICIG been successful in reversing the most harmful effect of impunity for serious crimes, namely the meteoric rise in homicidal violence in Guatemala in the early years of the 21st century?\n\nTo assess its impact, we use an econometric technique called a \u201csynthetic control.\u201d The idea is to use pre-CICIG data from 2000-2006 to identify a set of neighboring countries, which together form a hypothetical control group that evinces similar trends to Guatemala \u2014 but countries in which CICIG did not intervene.\n\nWe then can look at the period after the CICIG became operational to learn how the real Guatemala compares to the hypothetical one. The difference between these two (a \u201cdifference in differences\u201d) gives us an estimate of the effect that the CICIG had on the country\u2019s trajectory.\n\nThe numbers bear out the relevance of the comparison. In the figure below, the homicide trend in Guatemala and in the control group parallel one another in the years before the CICIG became operational. But after the commission begins its work, Guatemala experiences a rapid decline in homicides, even as the control group \u2014 the hypothetical Guatemala without the CICIG \u2014 continues to rise.\n\n\n\nComparative homicide trends in Guatemala and control group\n\nData: World Bank\n\nFigure: International Crisis Group\n\nOn average, Guatemala after the CICIG went into effect experienced nearly three fewer homicides per 100,000 each year than would have been expected. Extrapolating over the 2007 to 2017 period, the CICIG is associated with a net reduction of more than 4,500 homicides. To get a sense of the magnitude of that reduction, there were about 4,400 homicides in all of 2017 in Guatemala.\n\nMight the reduction in Guatemala\u2019s homicide rate be attributable to a third, unrelated factor? It\u2019s unlikely. Other important economic and social indicators \u2014 including GDP per capita, household consumption and infant mortality rates \u2014 have not changed in either Guatemala or the comparison group. Qualitative interviews discussed in the report confirm that the CICIG is widely seen as responsible for the changes in the capacity and conduct of prosecutors.\n\nWhat does this analysis suggest? The bottom line here is that the best available quantitative techniques, backed up by qualitative research, indicate that the CICIG has been associated with a sustained and dramatic reduction in Guatemala\u2019s murder rate. That\u2019s an uncommon achievement, one that stands in the commission\u2019s favor at a time when public attention is being drawn to thousands of Central Americans fleeing violence in their homelands.\n\nThinking beyond the Guatemalan case, changes that similarly boost the provision of justice could help Honduras and El Salvador. This could include supporting existing international institutions (such as the Mission to Support the Fight against Corruption and Impunity in Honduras, or MACCIH), or enacting new domestic policies.\n\nRenard Sexton is an Economics of Conflict fellow at the International Crisis Group and postdoctoral fellow at Princeton University. He will join the faculty of Emory University as assistant professor in 2019.", "Days after Hurricane Florence rammed into the North Carolina coast, President Trump was on his way to comfort those who lost homes or loved ones. He met with the state\u2019s Democratic governor; he sat for a briefing; he paused to ask residents in New Bern: \u201cHi, everybody, how\u2019s your house?\u201d\n\nWhen Hurricane Harvey pummeled Texas last year, he traveled to Houston, and when Hurricane Michael hit Florida and Georgia last month, he and the first lady quickly went to the Gulf Coast.\n\nBut as California has been convulsed in tragedy \u2014 a mass shooting and an outbreak of wildfires that included the deadliest in the state\u2019s history \u2014 the president has not only offered little comfort; he has also heaped on criticism. He\u2019s blamed the forest fires on \u201cgross mismanagement,\u201d threatened to withhold federal payments and instructed officials there: \u201cGet Smart!\u201d\n\nThe disparity in the responses to red states and blue states is one that continues to exacerbate the nation\u2019s partisan complexion, injected now even into natural disasters.\n\nA president who prizes and craves loyalty more than any other attribute, Trump has divided states into ones that voted for him and the ones that didn\u2019t, and found that last group wanting. In California, that has meant state officials are having to fight not only killer fires but also the combustible rhetoric coming from the Oval Office.\n\n\u201cThere is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor,\u201d Trump tweeted early Saturday, as fires consumed portions of the state in the north and the south. \u201cBillions of dollars are given each year, with so many lives lost, all because of gross mismanagement of the forests. Remedy now, or no more Fed payments!\u201d\n\nNot until 14 hours later did he express sympathy for the victims.\n\nCalifornia officials responded by pointing out that the latest fires have not started in forests but in suburban areas, fueled by scrub grasses and chaparral dried by the state\u2019s long-standing drought, and driven by blowtorch winds. Moreover, the vast majority of forest land in California is owned and controlled not by the state but by the federal government, under Trump\u2019s control.\n\n\u201cForestry management in this country is something we should debate; it\u2019s something we should talk about,\u201d said Michael Brown, who served as director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency during the George W. Bush administration. \u201cBut in the middle of the fire? That\u2019s not the time to debate it; that\u2019s not the time to make the point.\n\n\u201cIt detracted from what firefighters and California and other governors \u2014 red states and blue states \u2014 are doing to help protect California.\u201d\n\nWhite House officials did not respond when asked why Trump often appears to be more publicly critical of Democratic areas that suffer natural disasters, compared with more conservative states.\n\nOn Monday night, Trump announced he had agreed to sign the major federal disaster declaration that California officials had requested 24 hours earlier.\n\n\u201cWanted to respond quickly in order to alleviate some of the incredible suffering going on,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cI am with you all the way.\u201d\n\nSince he took office, Trump has made 111 trips to 26 states that he carried in 2016, while traveling 47 times to 10 states that he lost, according to figures compiled by Mark Knoller of CBS News.\n\nSix of those visits have been to areas hit by natural disasters. In 2017, Trump traveled to Texas twice after Hurricane Harvey, and once each to Puerto Rico, severely damaged by Hurricane Maria, and Florida after Irma. This year, Trump has made two hurricane-related trips: to the Carolinas after Hurricane Florence, and to Florida and Georgia post-Hurricane Michael.\n\nThe current California wildfires are the third to have occurred without a presidential visit. Trump has been to the state once since taking office, to survey prototypes of the wall he wants to build along the southern border.\n\nIn addition to his visits, Trump\u2019s remarks represent another way in which he has treated less-friendly areas differently than disaster zones more supportive of him.\n\nAhead of natural disasters, a review of his tweets indicate, he warns the public to evacuate and to listen to local officials (\u201cI encourage everyone in the path of #HurricaneHarvey to heed the advice & orders of their local and state officials\u201d). Afterward, he praises the cleanup work (\u201cRight now, everybody is saying what a great job we are doing with Hurricane Florence \u2014 and they are 100% correct\u201d). And later, he credits local Republican officials for advocating on behalf of their state (\u201cLake Okeechobee and all of the hurricane money were a passion for Rick Scott, who called endlessly on behalf of the People of Florida\u201d).\n\nHis treatment of California and Puerto Rico stands out for its post-disaster negativity.\n\nIn Puerto Rico, he got into a tit-for-tat argument with San Juan Mayor Carmen Yul\u00edn Cruz as recovery efforts were underway. Later, when he visited the U.S. territory, he was criticized for tossing paper towels into the crowd, as if making victims compete for the goods. He since has played down the number of deaths attributed to the hurricane and is working on plans to stop providing disaster relief funds for the island.\n\n\u201cThe people of Puerto Rico are wonderful but the inept politicians are trying to use the massive and ridiculously high amounts of hurricane/disaster funding to pay off other obligations,\u201d he wrote last month on Twitter, an accusation for which there is no proof.\n\nWhen it comes to California, at which Trump leveled blame even before praising firefighters, the disasters are striking at the epicenter of the anti-Trump resistance movement. Attorney General Xavier Becerra has sued the Trump administration dozens of times, attempting to block efforts to penalize sanctuary cities or to roll back environmental protections, among other things. In the midterm elections, Democrats won back numerous seats from Republicans, including in the longtime conservative bastion of Orange County.\n\nThe president has repeatedly blamed the state \u2014 falsely \u2014 for allowing millions of fraudulent ballots in 2016, which he says led to his loss of the popular vote to Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\nTrump\u2019s latest comments about fighting wildfires resurrect ones he made during fires in August and during comments in a Cabinet meeting last month.\n\n\u201cI say to the governor, or whoever is going to be the governor, of California: You better get your act together,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBecause California, we\u2019re just not going to continue to pay the kind of money that we\u2019re paying because of fires that should never be to [that] extent.\u201d\n\nGov. Jerry Brown (D) said during a Sunday news conference that Trump\u2019s emphasis on forest mismanagement missed the larger cause of the devastation. Fire experts insist that the intensity of recent fires has been exacerbated by climate change, the existence of which Trump has denied.\n\n\u201cManaging all the forests everywhere we can does not stop climate change,\u201d Brown said. \u201cAnd those who deny that are definitely contributing to the tragedies that we are now witnessing and will continue to witness in the coming years. The chickens are coming home to roost; this is real here.\u201d\n\nThe upside for California, which perennially delivers more in tax receipts to the U.S. government than it receives in federal money, is that Trump\u2019s treatment of it has yet to flow from word to action.\n\n\u201cTweets are not outcomes,\u201d said W. Craig Fugate, who was FEMA director during the Obama administration. \u201cMy observation is that FEMA has not been doing anything different in this administration than what we did in the Obama administration when it comes to presidential declarations.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, within 24 hours of making the request, California secured federal assistance to support communities affected by the fires. Brown requested a presidential major disaster declaration on Sunday; Trump announced Monday night that he had approved it.\n\nCongressional Democrats plan to demand $720 million for wildfire relief in California, Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) said Monday \u2014 adding that lawmakers will also have to appropriate more money for ongoing hurricane recovery in Texas, Florida and elsewhere, including Puerto Rico. Trump has signaled to lawmakers that he wants to stop sending disaster aid to Puerto Rico, a circumstance first reported by Axios and confirmed to The Washington Post by a person familiar with the situation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to disclose confidential deliberations.\n\n\u201cThe threat to cut off federal funding while the fires are very much burning is unconscionable for the president of the United States to say,\u201d said Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Tex.). \u201cIt\u2019s adversarial at the very worst time. Every state in the nation and every territory of the United States should be able to count on a sympathetic president who is trying to do everything he or she can in times of natural disaster, and it should be true whether the president is a Republican or a Democrat, or the state is red or blue.\u201d", "In this photo taken Wednesday, Oct. 17, 2018., the head of BIPM (International Bureau of Weights and Measures) Martin J.T.

But the way scientists define the exact mass of a kilogram is about to change.\n\nUntil now, its mass has been defined by the granddaddy of all kilos: a golf ball-sized metal cylinder locked in a vault in France. For more than a century, it has been the one true kilogram upon which all others were based.\n\nNo longer.\n\nGathering in Versailles, west of Paris, governments are expected on Friday to approve plans to instead use a scientific formulation to define the exact mass of a kilo. The change is expected to have practical applications in industries and sciences that require ultra-precise measurements of mass.\n\nAnd it will mean redundancy for the so-called Grand K, the kilo that has towered above them all since 1889.\n\nMade of a corrosion-resistant alloy of 90 percent platinum and 10 percent iridium , the international prototype kilo has rarely seen the light of day. Yet its role has been crucial, as the foundation for the globally accepted system for measuring mass upon which things like international trade depend.\n\nThree different keys, kept in separate locations, are required to unlock the vault where the Grand K and six official copies \u2014 collectively known as \u201cthe heir and the spares\u201d \u2014 are entombed together under glass bell-jars at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, in Sevres on the western outskirts of Paris.\n\nFounded by 17 nations in 1875 and known by its French initials, the BIPM is the guardian of the seven main units humanity uses to measure its world : the meter for length, the kilogram for mass, the second for time, the ampere for electric current, the kelvin for temperature, the mole for the amount of a substance and the candela for luminous intensity.\n\nOf the seven, the kilo is the last still based on a physical artefact, the Grand K. The meter, for example, used to be a meter-long metal bar but is now defined as the length that light travels in a vacuum in 1/299,792,458th of a second.\n\n\u201cThis, if you like, is a moment of celebration because it\u2019s like the last standard remaining from 1875 that will finally be replaced by new innovation,\u201d Martin Milton, the BIPM director, said in an Associated Press interview. \u201cEverything else has been recycled and replaced and improved. This is the last improvement that dates back to the original conception in 1875. So that\u2019s a tribute to what was done in 1875, that it\u2019s lasted this long.\u201d\n\nOnly exceedingly rarely, and exceedingly carefully, have the BIPM\u2019s master kilos been gingerly taken out so that other kilos sent back to Sevres from around the world could be compared against them, to be sure they were still properly calibrated, give or take the mass of a dust particle or two.\n\nAlthough many Americans commonly think of weight in pounds and ounces, the United States is officially a kilo country, too: It was one of the original 17 founders of the BIPM in 1875. The United States\u2019 primary kilo is called K20 and was assigned to the country in 1889 by the BIPM, along with another, K4. One kilo is equivalent to 2.2 pounds.\n\nThe U.S. also has six other platinum-iridium kilos: K79, 85, 92, 102, 104 and 105. They are all looked after by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, a branch of the U.S. Commerce Department.\n\nTo verify their mass, K20 and other kilos from around three dozen other countries were measured in Sevres against the BIPM\u2019s master kilos in a painstaking calibration exercise from 1988 to 1992. K20 was most recently then measured again at the BIPM in 2014.\n\nEven as humans argued, fought and slaughtered each other by the tens of millions in the 20th century, they shared the kilo. The kilo allocated to China in 1983, as it started to embrace market reforms that subsequently turned it into an economic behemoth, was the first manufactured with ultra-high precision diamond machining. Allocated to Japan in 1894, K39 was later ceded to South Korea in 1958.\n\nThe kilo is \u201ca tribute to man\u2019s ability to collaborate,\u201d Milton says. \u201cIt\u2019s been called a great work of peace, actually, because it\u2019s one of the areas where all of the states of the world come together with absolutely the same objective.\u201d\n\nThe metal kilo is being replaced by a definition based on Planck\u2019s constant, which is part of one of the most celebrated equations in physics but also devilishly difficult to explain . Suffice to say that the update should, in time, spare nations the need to occasionally send their kilos back to Sevres for calibration against the Grand K. Scientists instead should be able to accurately calculate an exact kilo, without having to measure one precious lump of metal against another.\n\nMilton says the change will have applications in computing, manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, the study of climate change and other sciences where precise measurements are required.\n\n\u201cThe system will be intrinsically correct by reference to the laws of science, the laws of nature,\u201d he said. \u201cWe won\u2019t have to depend on just assuming that one particular object never changes.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(David Brauchli, File/Associated Press)\n\nLONDON \u2014 Prince Charles turns 70 Wednesday and is still heir to the throne \u2014 a role he has served since he was a young child.\n\nHe\u2019s not lacking in things to do and shows few signs of slowing down \u2014 he is wealthy, extremely active in matters of great importance to him, and preparing to welcome his fourth grandchild into the world when Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, gives birth next spring.\n\nHis destiny, however, is to be king, a position he will automatically assume with the death of his 92-year-old mother, Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nWhen that happens, Charles will be bound by the constitutional requirement that the monarch refrain from trying to influence policy. Until then, Charles is free to lobby for action on climate change, support organic farming, and fight genetically modified crops as he sees fit.\n\nHe\u2019s doing all that while increasingly stepping in for the queen and supervising the Prince\u2019s Trust, an ambitious charity he founded 42 years ago that has helped hundreds of thousands of young Britons.\n\nIs the candle-crowded birthday cake a signal that it\u2019s time for the elegantly greying prince to take it easy? Not on your life, says Charles\u2019 wife, Camilla, the duchess of Cornwall.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he thinks he\u2019s 70,\u201d she wrote in a birthday tribute in The Telegraph Magazine. \u201cI think it\u2019s just a number to him. There\u2019s no way that he will slow down. You must be joking. I keep saying 70 is getting on a bit. It\u2019s not very old but it is old. You have to slow down a bit.\u201d\n\nThe royal family is in the midst of a slow, understated transition. The patriarch, 97-year-old Prince Philip, has formally retired from public life, although he makes occasional appearances in support of the queen.\n\nFor her part, the queen still maintains a busy schedule, but she no longer makes long haul flights to far flung parts of the 53-nation Commonwealth, and this year she took the unusual step of lobbying the Commonwealth countries to specify that Charles would be the next leader of the group, a position that is not hereditary.\n\nThe support for Charles was unanimous, reflecting not only appreciation for the queen\u2019s work over the decades but a belief that Charles has a strong commitment to the Commonwealth.\n\nCharles has also taken a more visible role representing the queen at some important national events, most recently during the Remembrance Day celebrations honoring Britain\u2019s fallen soldiers. He placed the queen\u2019s wreath at the foot of the Cenotaph monument while she watched from a balcony seat.\n\nBut his working trips abroad and his speeches at home generate precious little buzz as the press focuses on younger, more photogenic royals and their cute offspring.\n\nIn a way, Charles is sandwiched between generations, caught between his mother, a symbol of dignity and continuity who has reigned since 1952, and his two immensely popular sons, Prince William and Prince Harry, who have along with their wives come to symbolize the future of the world\u2019s best known monarchy.\n\nWilliam and Harry also remind many of their mother, the late Princess Diana, who died in a Paris car crash in 1997 after a messy divorce from Charles that for a time tarnished his standing with the British public.\n\nIt is William and Harry \u2014 along with their wives Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge and Meghan \u2014 who appear on the cover of glossy magazines, not the about-to-be-70 Charles. It is the young royals who are seen as glamorous modernizers with the common touch, while Charles is sometimes perceived as dour, preachy and remote.\n\nCamilla says the public doesn\u2019t understand how \u201cincredibly kind\u201d and funny Charles is, and William and Harry \u2014 taking part in a rare BBC interview to mark his father\u2019s birthday \u2014 praise the way he has used his undefined position as Prince of Wales to advocate so many important causes, such as environmental protection.\n\nBut Harry \u2014 who has endeared himself to the British public in part with his impish smile and sunny outlook \u2014 urged his dad to cut back a bit on the doom and gloom that often accompanies Charles\u2019 pronouncements.\n\n\u201cI would encourage him to remain optimistic because I think it can be very easy to become despondent and negative,\u201d Harry said. \u201cBut hopefully with his children and his grandchildren, and a few more grandchildren to come, he can get energy from the family side and then carry on his leadership role.\u201d\n\nHe also had this advice: don\u2019t work so hard, and have dinner earlier.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Joyce Koh /The Washington Post)\n\nOn The Hill\n\nNEW KIDS ON THE BLOCK: As the most diverse (and most female) House Democratic class arrives in Washington this week, there's one word some will be shouting from the monument tops and others probably won't even want to whisper: impeachment.\n\nAccording to a Power Up analysis of statements made during the campaign by the 52 Democrats who won election to the House this year, only 11 \u2014 or 21 percent \u2014 have said they want to immediately move to impeach President Trump. Thirteen Democratic freshmen outright oppose impeachment and the largest number \u2014 17 Democrats or 33 percent \u2014 said they wanted to see Robert Mueller's report on Russian interference in the 2016 election and whether Trump officials had links to the Kremlin before deciding whether to move ahead on impeaching the president. We couldn't find a record in news reports of 11 more Democrats commenting on the issue.\n\nDemocrats' conflicting views on the \u201cI word\u201d are likely to cause major headaches for the new Democratic House leadership. Speaker hopeful Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said before the elections she wouldn't charge ahead with impeachment before Mueller delivers his report \u2014 and even then such a move would have to be bipartisan. Incoming House Judiciary Committee Chair Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), whose committee would spearhead hearings, said Sunday that Democrats were \u201cfar from\u201d impeachment proceedings at the moment.\n\nPelosi has been \u201cpretty clear that Democrats top priority is advancing legislation connected to our 'For the People' agenda and that impeachment would depend on the facts,\u201d Pelosi's communications director Ashley Etienne wrote us in an email.\n\nNonetheless, the tension between the freshman class \u2014 many of whom rode to power on intense dislike of Trump \u2014 and the House Democratic leadership will be a big story line in the new Congress when it convenes in January. Just ask House Republican leaders who tried to corral the 2010 tea-party class.\n\nMore on impeachment:\n\nFlipping out: Of the 30 lawmakers who oppose impeachment or are waiting for Mueller's probe to end, 24 ran in districts they were trying to flip from red to blue \u2014 meaning they toed a fine line on the issue during their winning campaigns and are likely to do so in Washington.\n\nRisky: In Colorado\u2019s 6th district, for example, Rep.-elect Jason Crow (D) said he opposed impeachment. In Texas\u2019s 32nd district, rising Democratic star Rep.-elect Colin Allred (D) said it was important to allow Mueller to finish his work. Crow ousted Rep. Mike Coffman (R-Colo.) and Allred defeated Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Texas).\n\nNot risky: Eight of the 11 pro-impeachment lawmakers hailed from districts already controlled by Democrats. They include Reps-elect Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), who represent liberal bastions in Minneapolis and the Bronx. Omar has called the president a \u201ctyrant\u201d and said he \u201chas developed tendencies of dictatorship,\u201d while Ocasio-Cortez cited Trump\u2019s alleged violation of the Constitution's emoluments clause and alleged campaign finance abuses as grounds for impeachment.\n\nWhat Democratic voters want: \u201cAround 40 percent of 2018 voters said they want [Trump] impeached, according to CNN's national exit polls . . . 77 percent of self identified Democrats supported impeachment in the exit polls,\u201d CNN's Grace Sparks reports.\n\nThreading the needle: \u201cThe new Democratic leadership and the entire Democratic caucus will really have to pull together to ensure a unified legislative agenda that appeals to constituents in Brooklyn, New York, while appealing to constituents in Brooklyn, Iowa,\u201d said Steve Israel, a former congressman from New York and one-time chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. \u201cThe way to keep these new Democrats in 2020 is not to do things that force their voters to reconsider, and that won\u2019t be easy,\u201d per the New York Times' Sheryl Gay Stolberg's excellent piece on the freshman House Democrats.\n\nYou are reading the Power Up newsletter.

Its support isn\u2019t guaranteed: May is under pressure from pro-Brexit ministers not to make further concessions to the EU on the key issue of the Irish border.\n\nA spokesman for chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier urged caution, saying a deal wasn\u2019t yet finalized and the bloc would \u201ctake stock\u201d Wednesday.\n\nAmbassadors from the 27 other EU countries are also due to hold a meeting in Brussels on Wednesday.\n\nBritain wants to seal a deal this fall, so that Parliament has time to vote on it before the U.K. leaves the bloc on March 29. The European Parliament also has to approve any agreement, as do all 28 EU nations.\n\nOfficials have said for weeks that agreement on divorce terms and a framework for future U.K.-EU relations was 95 percent complete, and for several days negotiators have been meeting late into the night in Brussels in a bid to close the remaining gaps.\n\nThe main obstacle has long been how to ensure there are no customs posts or other checks along the border between the U.K.\u2019s Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland after Brexit. Britain and the EU agree that there must be barriers that could disrupt businesses and residents on either side of the border and undermine Northern Ireland\u2019s hard-won peace process \u2014 but they have differed on how to achieve that.\n\nIrish national broadcaster RTE said the draft agreement involves a common customs arrangement for the U.K. and the EU, to eliminate the need for border checks, with special provisions for Northern Ireland and a review mechanism to oversee its functioning.\n\nA sticking point in talks has been Britain\u2019s insistence that any such customs arrangement must be temporary. The EU says that in order to guarantee an open border, it can\u2019t have a time limit.\n\nThe pound rallied on news of a deal, rising 1.5 percent against the dollar to $1.3038.\n\nBut May faces pressure from pro-Brexit Cabinet members and lawmakers not to agree to an arrangement that binds Britain to EU trade rules indefinitely.\n\nFormer Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, a staunch Brexiteer, said the deal was unacceptable and Cabinet ministers should \u201cchuck it out.\u201d\n\nMay also faces growing opposition from pro-EU lawmakers, who say her proposed Brexit deal is worse than the status quo and the British public should get a new vote on whether to leave or to stay.\n\nIf there is no agreement soon, U.K. businesses will have to start implementing contingency plans for a \u201cno-deal\u201d Brexit \u2014 steps that could include cutting jobs, stockpiling goods and relocating production and services outside Britain.\n\nEven with such measures in place, the British government says leaving the EU without a deal could cause major economic disruption, with gridlock at ports and disruption to supplies of foods, goods and medicines.\n\nOn Tuesday, the European Commission published a sheaf of notices outlining changes in a host of areas in the event of a no-deal Brexit. They point to major disruption for people and businesses: U.K. truckers\u2019 licenses won\u2019t be valid in the EU, British airlines will no longer enjoy traffic rights, and even British mineral water will cease to be recognized as such by the EU.\n\nThe EU said Tuesday it was proposing visa-free travel for U.K. citizens on short trips, even if there is no deal \u2014 but only if Britain reciprocates.\n\nMeanwhile, official figures suggest Brexit is already having an impact on the British workforce.\n\nThe Office for National Statistics said the number of EU citizens working in the country \u2014 2.25 million\u2014 was down 132,000 in the three months to September from the year before. That\u2019s the largest annual fall since comparable records began in 1997.\n\nMost of the fall is due to fewer workers from eight eastern European countries that joined the EU in 2004.\n\nJonathan Portes, professor of economics at King\u2019s College London, said the prospect of Brexit \u201chas clearly made the U.K. a much less attractive place for Europeans to live and work.\u201d\n\n___\n\nRaf Casert in Brussels contributed to this story.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

U.S. analysts say they have located more than half of an estimated 20 secret North Korean missile development facilities. The findings come as the Trump administration\u2019s denuclearization talks with the North appear to have stalled. And they highlight the challenge the U.S. faces in ensuring that North Korea complies with any eventual agreement that covers its nuclear and missile programs. (Susan Walsh, Pool, File/Associated Press)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 U.S. analysts said Monday they have located 13 secret North Korean missile development sites, underscoring the challenge that the Trump administration faces in trying to reach its promised broad arms control agreement with Pyongyang.\n\nThe administration has said it is hopeful about eventually reaching an agreement with North Korea. President Donald Trump declared after his historic summit in June that with President Kim Jong Un there was \u201cno longer a nuclear threat from North Korea.\u201d But a report based on satellite imagery shows the complexity posed by an extensive network of weapons facilities that the U.S. wants to neutralize.\n\nA report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies has identified 13 secret facilities used to produce missiles and related technology. Although the sites are not launch facilities and in some cases are rudimentary, the authors of the report say they are hidden and illustrate the scope of the North\u2019s weapons program and the country\u2019s determination to conceal its military might.\n\n\u201cThe dispersed deployment of these bases and distinctive tactics employed by ballistic missile units are combined with decades of extensive camouflage, concealment and deception practices to maximize the survival of its missile units from pre-emptive strikes and during wartime operations,\u201d they said.\n\nThe authors say the sites, which can be used for all classes of ballistic missiles, should be declared by North Korea and inspected in any credible, verifiable deal that addresses Pyongyang\u2019s most significant threats to the United States and its allies.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s presidential office said the report didn\u2019t include any information it didn\u2019t already know. Presidential spokesman Kim Eui-kyeom said continued activity at North Korean missile sites only underlines the need for nuclear negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang to proceed at a faster pace.\n\nKim took exception to a New York Times article on the report that said North Korea was engaging in \u201cgreat deception,\u201d saying that the North has never promised to dismantle a short-range ballistic missile base 135 kilometers (84 miles) northwest of Seoul that was highlighted by CSIS.\n\nKim said such suggestions can \u201ctrigger misunderstanding and potentially block dialogue ... at a time when we need dialogue between North Korea and the United States.\u201d\n\nSeoul has worked hard to revive nuclear negotiations between the U.S. and North Korea that have reduced fears of war in South Korea following a series of North Korean weapons tests and threats of military action by Trump last year.\n\nNorth Korea analysts not involved in the report said the findings were not surprising given Pyongyang\u2019s past activities but were still cause for concern. They noted that Kim had not agreed to halt either nuclear weapons or missile development in negotiations with Trump or Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\n\u201cThe fact that North Korea has continued to build nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles in the midst of high-level diplomacy with China, South Korea and the U.S. should not come as a surprise,\u201d said Abraham Denmark, the Asia program director at The Wilson Center. \u201cDespite all the summitry, North Korea is just as dangerous today as it was a year ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cImproving relations with Pyongyang may be a laudable goal, but any claim that the North Korean nuclear and missile threats have been solved is either wishful thinking or purposefully deceptive,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cInteresting but unsurprising report,\u201d said Kelsey Davenport, director for nonproliferation policy at the Arms Control Association. \u201cKim Jong Un only committed voluntarily to halt long-range missile tests.\u201d\n\nThe report was released less than a week after North Korea abruptly called off a new round of negotiations with Pompeo that had been set for Thursday in New York. The cancellation, which the U.S. ascribed to scheduling issues, followed threats from North Korean officials to resume nuclear and missile testing unless U.S. sanctions are lifted.\n\nThe administration has said repeatedly that sanctions will not be lifted until a denuclearization agreement is fully implemented.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Kim Tong-hyung in Seoul, South Korea, contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Khalifa Hifter, commander of the self-styled Libyan National Army that is based in Libya\u2019s east.\n\n\u201cThe informal meeting, held this (morning) with a number of players and having them presented as the prominent protagonists of the Mediterranean, is a very misleading and damaging approach which we vehemently oppose,\u201d Turkish Vice-President Fuat Oktay told reporters.\n\n\u201cTurkey is leaving the meeting with deep disappointment,\u201d he said.\n\nConte said he was personally sorry for the pullout but said such reactions were to be expected given the sensibilities in the region.\n\nExpectations going into the meeting were limited, with Hiftar\u2019s camp making clear that he wasn\u2019t participating in the conference itself but rather meeting with leaders of neighboring countries on the sidelines. Neither Hiftar nor el-Sissi nor Oktay posed for the final conference group photo.\n\nSalame, however, said he was heartened by both Hiftar and Serraj\u2019s commitment to participate in the consultative conference in Libya scheduled for the first weeks of next year. The U.N. has been soliciting input from a broad array of Libyans on the way forward, but says the time has come for a wider group to devise a clear timetable for elections.\n\n\u201cI feel more reassured about the convening and the possible success of this national conference,\u201d he said.\n\nLibya plunged into chaos after the 2011 uprising that ousted and killed longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi, and it is now governed by rival administrations in the east and west with both relying on the support of militias.\n\nIt has also become a haven for Islamic militants and armed groups, including several from neighboring countries, which survive on looting and human trafficking, particularly in the remote south of the country.\n\nItaly\u2019s anti-migrant government is keen in particular to stem the Libyan-based migrant smuggling networks that have sent hundreds of thousands of would-be refugees to Europe via Italy in recent years.\n\n___\n\nAP producer Maggie Hyde in Palermo; Brian Rohan in Cairo and Nicole Winfield in Rome contributed.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP/AP)\n\nJoaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n, the famed Mexican drug lord known as \u201cEl Chapo,\u201d has spent the past 22 months in a small, windowless cell in Lower Manhattan awaiting trial. On Tuesday, at a federal district court in Brooklyn, that trial will finally start.\n\n\u201cThis is such an important case, because no single individual in Mexico is more responsible for the last decade of violence than Chapo Guzm\u00e1n,\u201d said David Shirk, a professor at the University of San Diego who focuses on Mexican politics and U.S.-Mexico border issues.\n\nSo why is Guzm\u00e1n standing trial in New York rather than in Mexico?\n\nMexico has certainly tried to bring Guzm\u00e1n to justice before, but he has twice escaped from maximum security prisons in his native country. During his imprisonment in 2001, he enlisted the help of the prison guards to sneak him to safety \u2014 hiding in a laundry cart, as the legend goes. He famously escaped again in 2015, breaking out of Mexico\u2019s most secure prison via a mile-long tunnel and evading capture for six months.\n\n[El Chapo trial begins: Drug kingpin faces life in prison]\n\n\u201cFrankly, Mexico\u2019s prison system has a long history of this sort of corruption and duplicity when it comes to drug-trafficking organizations because they\u2019re so powerful,\u201d said Eric Olson, deputy director of the Latin America program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.\n\nThe 2015 escape seemed to make Mexican authorities acknowledge that Guzm\u00e1n had the upper hand over their judicial system. The year before, then-Attorney General Jes\u00fas Murillo Karam had ruled out extraditing Guzm\u00e1n to the United States. \u201cEl Chapo must stay here to complete his sentence and then I will extradite him,\u201d Murillo said. \u201cSo about 300 or 400 years later \u2014 it will be a while.\"\n\nBut after Guzm\u00e1n was recaptured in 2016, Mexico sent him north to face trial. \u201cI think they recognized that there was weakness still in the system,\u201d Olson said. \u201cIt became a situation where the risks of extraditing him became less than the risks of not extraditing him,\u201d he added.\n\nShirk gave many reasons why trying Guzm\u00e1n in the United States would be different from trying him in Mexico: Guzm\u00e1n won\u2019t be able to run his operation from his prison cell the way he did in Mexico; judges and jury members are less likely to be intimidated or bribed into giving him a favorable ruling; and there are fewer legal tactics that could allow his lawyers to continually delay a trial.\n\nFor these reasons, the United States has a long history of trying criminals when other countries' judicial systems lack the resources or ability to do so. But not everyone thinks extradition is the best long-term solution for bringing criminals to justice.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been the prison system of last resort for the Western Hemisphere, and that absolves these countries of the responsibility to take care of their own problems,\u201d Shirk said. \u201cIt\u2019s in our interest to do so because many of these people are committing crimes against the United States, but arguably the hemisphere would be better off if the rule of law were stronger in all of these individual countries.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nMexican drug lord Joaqu\u00edn \u2018El Chapo\u2019 Guzm\u00e1n extradited to U.S.\n\nResidents in a Mexican neighborhood miss the cartel that protected them", "BERLIN \u2014 German authorities say a Turkish man has been extradited from France on charges of supporting a banned Kurdish organization.\n\nFederal prosecutors said Tuesday that Ozkan T., a 31-year-old whose last name wasn\u2019t given in line with privacy laws, was extradited Monday.

(Ian Langsdon/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)\n\nA member of the Saudi team that killed Washington Post contributing columnist Jamal Khashoggi made a phone call shortly after the journalist\u2019s death, giving instructions to someone in Saudi Arabia to \u201ctell your boss\u201d that the assassination had been carried out, according to people familiar with the call.\n\nThe message appears to have been directed to a person overseeing the team, which killed Khashoggi inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2 and then dismembered and disposed of his body, the people said. But, they added, U.S. and European officials are not certain to whom \u201cyour boss\u201d refers.\n\nOfficials in multiple countries have said they don\u2019t think the journalist could have been killed without the knowledge of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the Trump administration\u2019s key ally in the Arab world. But so far, no \u201csmoking gun\u201d has emerged definitively showing Mohammed knew about or ordered the operation, these officials said, and Saudi officials deny that the crown prince was in any way responsible for Khashoggi\u2019s death.\n\nThe New York Times first reported on the phone call that relayed the message that Khashoggi had been killed.\n\n[Crown prince Mohammed bin Salman is \u2018chief of the tribe\u2019 in a cowed House of Saud]\n\nThe Turkish government allowed CIA Director Gina Haspel to listen to the audio recording of events that took place inside the consulate and to the telephone conversations that took place between the team and Saudi Arabia, a senior Turkish official said. U.S. officials have heard a recording of the call in which a \u201cboss\u201d is referred to, one person familiar with the matter said.\n\nTurkey also thinks the United States has information, possibly including intercepted Saudi communications, beyond what Turkish intelligence has gathered, the person said.\n\nNational security adviser John Bolton said Tuesday that the audio recording did not appear to provide any link between the killers and Mohammed. Speaking on the sidelines of a regional summit in Singapore, Bolton said that he has not listened to the recording himself but that \u201cthose who have listened to it\u201d assess that it does not implicate Saudi Arabia\u2019s de facto ruler. The crown prince\u2019s father, King Salman is formally the head of the country.\n\nSaudi officials said the Turks have not provided audio to them that includes the phrase \u201ctell your boss.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe categorically deny the reporting referencing the crown prince in this matter or that he had any knowledge whatsoever of it,\u201d a Saudi official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the matter. \u201cDespite our multiple requests, the Turkish authorities have not provided us with the recordings. However, they allowed our intelligence services to hear recordings, and at no moment were there any references to the mentioned phrase in those recordings.\u201d\n\nSaudi Arabia has not been entirely forthcoming with information about the role of its citizens in the killing, according to a Turkish official.\n\nAlthough Saudi Arabia sent its senior prosecutor to Turkey last month for what it called a \u201cjoint\u201d investigation, the Saudis shared no information and appeared only interested in learning what the Turkish investigators knew, the official said. Since the prosecutor\u2019s return to Saudi Arabia, the kingdom has not responded to Turkish requests for information on 18 Saudis arrested in the case, including the results of any interrogations of those detained. That includes information on the disposal of Khashoggi\u2019s remains, which have not been found.\n\nBolton\u2019s comments playing down the phone call as a link to Mohammed reflect President Trump\u2019s own resistance to blaming the crown prince for the journalist\u2019s death.\n\n[After journalist\u2019s killing, focus shifts to young prince\u2019s \u2018dark\u2019 and bullying side]\n\nTrump has indicated to aides that he is inclined to accept the official Saudi explanation that rogue operative killed Khashoggi without Mohammed\u2019s knowledge.\n\nThe Saudi version of events has changed over time. Initially, the kingdom said that Khashoggi left the consulate on Oct. 2, after stopping in to obtain documents he needed for his marriage and that it had no knowledge about where he went subsequently.\n\nBut as evidence from flight manifests and video surveillance mounted, including footage of personal security guards for the crown prince at the consulate, the Saudi government acknowledged the killing but blamed it on a group of outliers.\n\nTrump has repeatedly emphasized the importance of maintaining a close relationship with Saudi Arabia, the world\u2019s largest purchaser of U.S. defense equipment.\n\nAt a news conference last Wednesday, Trump declined to respond to a question on whether he considered the Saudi government responsible for the killing. He said he was consulting with Congress on how to respond and that \u201cI\u2019ll have a much stronger opinion on that subject over the next week. I\u2019m forming a very strong opinion.\u201d\n\nU.S. officials have said that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, whom Trump sent to Riyadh and Ankara, the Saudi and Turkish capitals, respectively, for consultations two weeks after Khashoggi was killed, has pushed the Saudis hard for answers. In a telephone call Sunday with Mohammed, Pompeo \u201cemphasized that the United States will hold all of those involved in the killing of Jamal Khashoggi accountable, and that Saudi Arabia must do the same,\u201d the State Department said in a statement.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and other Turkish officials have said they do not believe King Salman is responsible but have implied that orders for the operation came from Mohammed. A central question for the Trump administration will be whether to blame the crown prince, if it comes to believe he is responsible, even if, as is expected, a Saudi investigation does not implicate him.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t made a determination\u201d about whether Mohammed knew of the plot to kill Khashoggi, one U.S. official said. \u201cWe can see people signaling that the U.S.-Saudi relationship is very important, but that\u2019s different. That\u2019s not saying that the crown prince is very important.\u201d But experts also believe that any U.S. assignment of guilt to the crown prince would severely affect the bilateral relationship.\n\nTrump has all but ruled out punishing the kingdom by withholding weapons sales, insisting that the Saudis would simply buy billions of dollars in arms from Russia or China.\n\nWhen he visited Riyadh on his first presidential trip overseas in May 2017, Trump said the Saudis had agreed to a $110 billion weapons purchase. But many of those potential sales were negotiated under the Obama administration or amounted to little more than expressions of interest.

Saudi Arabia let pass a September deadline for signing a sales contract to buy the U.S. THAAD missile defense system, the biggest item in the prospective Trump package at $15 billion.\n\nThe United States is also depending on Saudi Arabia to maintain high levels of oil production to keep international prices from rising while the U.S. administration implements sanctions against Iranian oil exports.

(Mohammed Saber/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)\n\nPalestinian factions in Gaza said they had agreed to an Egyptian-brokered cease-fire with Israel on Tuesday, after the worst outbreak of violence since the two sides fought a 50-day war in the summer of 2014, although analysts warned that the security situation remains fragile.\n\nBy sundown, the exchange of fire that had rocked Gaza and surrounding Israeli communities with relentless explosions appeared to have stopped. The \u201cjoint operations room\u201d of armed factions in Gaza \u2014 including the armed wing of the militant group Hamas, which rules the territory \u2014 said that a cease-fire had been reached and would remain in place \u201cas long as it is committed to by the Zionist enemy.\u201d\n\nAfter a six-hour meeting, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his security cabinet did not confirm the agreement, saying only that the Israeli military had been \u201cinstructed to continue its operations as necessary,\u201d but Israeli news outlets reported that a cease-fire had been agreed to.\n\nIsraeli officials\u2019 reluctance to acknowledge a cease-fire underscores the delicate balancing act they are facing as they try to reach a long-term agreement with Hamas, which they view as a terrorist group bent on Israel\u2019s destruction.\n\nBefore the latest flare-up, the two sides had been close to such a deal. It would have entailed economic aid for Gaza, including a cash injection and international reconstruction projects, in return for Hamas clamping down on border demonstrations and preventing the use of incendiary kites that have been launched across the border fence into Israel.\n\nAnalysts say that the two sides are not interested in another round of conflict but that both are grappling with internal pressure to show strength. Netanyahu, who is nearing an election year, has been criticized for his approach by right-wing members of his coalition and Israeli residents near Gaza. Hamas has been castigated by other militant factions in Gaza for dealing with the enemy.\n\n\u201cEven if they manage to get this cease-fire understanding going, we\u2019ve seen how fragile they can be and I don\u2019t expect it to last long,\u201d said Ofer Zalzberg, an analyst with the International Crisis Group.\n\n\n\nA man stands near a house in the Israeli city of Ashkelon that was damaged by a rocket fired from the Gaza Strip.

An Israeli officer was also killed.\n\n[Botched Israeli army operation in Gaza triggers sharp escalation in violence]\n\nThe Israeli military said that about 460 rockets were launched from Gaza toward Israel. More than 100 were intercepted by Israel\u2019s aerial defense system, but others struck residential buildings.\n\nIsraeli jets responded with more than 160 airstrikes, which officials said targeted Hamas and Islamic Jihad, Gaza\u2019s second-\n\nlargest militant faction. The attacks destroyed the headquarters of the Hamas-run al-Aqsa television station, other buildings housing its old offices and Hamas\u2019s military intelligence bureau. The Israeli military said its naval forces also struck Hamas ships, as well as numerous weapons storehouses and manufacturing facilities.\n\nIn central Gaza City, near the seafront, the militant group\u2019s four-story internal security building was reduced to rubble, which filled the street. Some houses were damaged as well.\n\n\u201cWe were terrified. All the children in the house were screaming.

Residents of Israel\u2019s southern cities, forced to stay indoors and near protected areas, expressed anger that a long-term diplomatic solution to the continual rounds of hostilities has not been found.\n\nHundreds of residents of the southern Israeli city of Sderot protested Tuesday night against the cease-fire and Netanyahu.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s time the army went in and cleaned them out, cleaned the whole place,\u201d said Shabtai Biran, a resident of Ashkelon, a coastal city a few miles from the northern tip of the Gaza Strip. \u201cThere are innocents here who are getting hurt.\u201d\n\nOne resident of his neighborhood, Shimshon, was killed and two women were seriously injured when a rocket hit their three-story apartment block. The man was a Palestinian from Hebron, in the West Bank.\n\nThroughout the day, a steady stream of Israeli politicians arrived in the area. Some were more welcome than others. Tzipi Livni, an opposition leader and former peace negotiator, was chased away by angry residents in Shimshon. Tamar Zandberg, head of the left-wing Meretz party, also received a frosty reception. She said the situation was untenable for Israel and residents in the south in particular.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that the prime minister is always going for short-term solutions. While I support short-term solutions, they need to be part of a longer process,\u201d Zandberg said. \u201cI think that as soon as there is a cease-fire, everything needs to be done to reach a wider peace process.\u201d\n\nSome members of Netanyahu\u2019s coalition are pushing for more decisive action. Israeli Education Minister Naftali Bennett, leader of the right-wing Jewish Home party, has criticized attempts to broker a deal with Hamas. On Tuesday, after Israeli news reports that Bennett had supported a cease-fire, his office issued a statement describing them as \u201ccompletely false.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the cabinet, Minister Bennett presented his firm position as expressed in recent months and his plan to face the threat from Gaza,\u201d his office said.\n\n\n\nRelatives mourn the death of Hamad al-Nahal, a member of the Islamc Jihad who was killed in an Israeli airstrike on the Gaza Strip a day earlier, during his funeral in Rafah on Nov. 13.

He noted that the Palestinian Authority, which governs the occupied West Bank, is unlikely to resume control in Gaza. \u201cThe consequence is the recognition of Hamas as the power in control of the Gaza Strip,\u201d he said.\n\nMichael said the main threat to reaching a truce comes from Islamic Jihad, which has positioned itself to benefit from Hamas\u2019s weakness amid growing unhappiness among Gaza\u2019s 2 million residents. Gaza\u2019s residents have faced severe trade and travel restrictions by Israel for more than a decade, and the border with Egypt is opened only sporadically.\n\nSince early this year, Hamas had diverted some of the internal discontent toward Israel by encouraging weekly demonstrations along the border fence. Israeli officials say Hamas has used the border protests as a cover to carry out attacks and infiltrate Israeli territory.\n\n[After more than 2,100 deaths, the Gaza war ends where it began]\n\nIn Gaza, some took to the streets Tuesday to celebrate after the cease-fire was announced.

An automatic recount in tight Florida races for senator and governor. A stock market plunge.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s Twitter finger has been itchy the past few days, fanning the flames of conspiracy theories and offering speculation without evidence. We asked the White House for evidence for his statements but heard nothing back. Here\u2019s a guide to the Four-Pinocchio fury.\n\n\u201cThere is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor. Billions of dollars are given each year, with so many lives lost, all because of gross mismanagement of the forests. Remedy now, or no more Fed payments!\u201d\n\n\u2014 Tweet, Nov. 10\n\nAs the most destructive wildfire in California history was raging, Trump pinned the blame on state officials and their \u201cgross mismanagement of the forests.\u201d\n\nHis tweet is wrong on several levels.\n\nFirst, experts say the wildfires besetting the state were not sparked by forest management problems such as an overpopulation of trees or dead trees.\n\n\u201cThe ones in Southern California are burning in chaparral, so it\u2019s not a forest management issue at all,\u201d said LeRoy Westerling, a climate and fire researcher at the University of California at Merced. \u201cThe fire in Northern California didn\u2019t start in forest; it started in other types of vegetation, from what I read. \u2026 There, you\u2019re talking about what kind of vegetation people manage on their homes on private properties.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cIt seems like they\u2019re conflating the forest management issue, which is primarily in federal land in California, with all the other causes of fires in the state, and that doesn\u2019t seem reasonable.\u201d\n\nThat brings us to our second point. Some California forests appear to have many more trees per acre than what is considered healthy, according to an expert cited by the San Francisco Chronicle. But more than half of the state\u2019s forested land is managed by the federal government. The U.S. Forest Service says the \u201crising costs of fighting fires has led [it] to regularly raid its $600 million budget for forest management,\u201d according to the Sacramento Bee.\n\nEven if poor forest management had caused these fires, the ball would be in Trump\u2019s court, not the state government\u2019s.\n\nThird, the scientific consensus is that climate change is the big driver of these intensifying wildfires, although other factors such as forest management play a (smaller) role.\n\nA 2016 study of western U.S. forests published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found \u201chuman-caused climate change caused over half of the documented increases in fuel aridity since the 1970s and doubled the cumulative forest fire area since 1984.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe estimate that human-caused climate change contributed to an additional 4.2 million ha [hectares] of forest fire area during 1984\u20142015, nearly doubling the forest fire area expected in its absence,\u201d authors John T. Abatzoglou and A. Park Williams wrote. \u201cNatural climate variability will continue to alternate between modulating and compounding anthropogenic increases in fuel aridity, but anthropogenic climate change has emerged as a driver of increased forest fire activity and should continue to do so while fuels are not limiting.\u201d\n\nWesterling put it this way: \u201cIt can be exacerbated or compounded by problems in other areas, if you\u2019ve mismanaged vegetation or something like that, [but] we wouldn\u2019t be seeing fires of the kind we\u2019re seeing without climate change.\u201d\n\nFinally, Trump is wrong to claim the federal government sends billions of dollars \u201ceach year\u201d in forest-fire aid to California. The Sacramento Bee in October found \u201cthe U.S. government has spent about $1.4 billion the past two years dealing with wildfires in California.\u201d\n\nTrump blames California for these fires at virtually every turn. He was also wrong in August when he claimed poor water management was feeding the problem, according to an Associated Press fact check.\n\n\u201cRick Scott was up by 50,000+ votes on Election Day, now they \u2018found\u2019 many votes and he is only up 15,000 votes. \u2018The Broward Effect.' How come they never find Republican votes?\u201d\n\n\u2014 Tweet, Nov. 9\n\nTrump\u2019s tweet suggests only votes for Democrats were counted, as he asks \u201chow come they never find any Republican votes?\u201d But guess what? They did! It\u2019s just that more votes were counted for the Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson than for Republican challenger Gov. Rick Scott. Broward tilts heavily toward Democrats, so it would be expected that Democrats would close the margin as votes in the county were tabulated. So far, Nelson has gained about 46,000 votes, compared to about 24,000 for Scott.\n\nTrump might be on stronger ground to complain about Broward\u2019s handling of the process. Brenda Snipes, the Broward County supervisor of elections, over the years has faced lawsuits that have challenged her management record and how votes were counted. Snipes was appointed in 2003 by Gov. Jeb Bush (R) and has been reelected four times.\n\n\u201cThe Florida Election should be called in favor of Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis in that large numbers of new ballots showed up out of nowhere, and many ballots are missing or forged. An honest vote count is no longer possible-ballots massively infected. Must go with Election Night!\u201d\n\n\u2014 Tweet, Nov. 12\n\nTrump oddly suggests only the votes that were counted on Election Day should count, even though that\u2019s not actually feasible in most cases, especially in a state as large as Florida in which more than 8 million ballots were cast. News organizations may \u201ccall\u201d a race, but results are only official when election officials complete the count and certify the numbers.\n\nFlorida law requires a machine recount when the margin is less than 0.5 percentage points. Scott\u2019s lead over Nelson has shrunk to 0.14 percentage points, so it is likely there will also be a hand recount. (The threshold for a hand count is 0.25 points.) In the governor\u2019s race, former congressman Ron DeSantis is ahead of Democratic Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum by 0.41 percentage points, which also triggered a machine recount.\n\nUnder Florida law, vote-by-mail ballots must be received by local supervisors of elections by 7 p.m. on Election Day, though overseas and military ballots are accepted after as long as 10 days after Election Day (in this case Nov. 16), as long as they are postmarked by Election Day. Trump\u2019s tweet on Veterans Day appeared to suggest military votes should not be counted.\n\nDemocrats, citing mail-delivery delays, have filed suit calling for all vote-by-mail ballots that were postmarked before Election Day to be counted. (Miami-Dade County\u2019s election department received 266 ballots that had been found in the Opa-locka mail sorting facility, but for now, they won\u2019t be counted.)\n\nTrump claimed, without evidence, \u201cmany ballots are missing or forged.\u201d The White House did not respond to a request for an explanation.

In fact, it\u2019s pretty silly to blame any single event for stock-market jitters. The technology sector fell after a key Apple supplier, Lumentum Holdings, cut its earnings and revenue outlook after it said a major customer \u2014 believed to be Apple \u2014 significantly reduced its orders for laser diodes. The announcement sent Lumentum down 33 percent, and many other tech stocks fell as well.\n\nThis is just the latest warning sign in the once-sizzling tech sector.

(Perhaps recognizing this connection, Trump later tweeted that the Saudis should not do that.) Another thing hanging over the market: Trump\u2019s trade war with China.\n\nThe Dow Jones closed the day down more than 600 points, or 2.3 percent. Trump regularly took credit for stock-market highs when the market was going up, telling audiences that he made their retirement plans richer.

David Ake/AP)\n\nForest fires in California. An automatic recount in tight Florida races for senator and governor. A stock market plunge.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s Twitter finger has been itchy the past few days, fanning the flames of conspiracy theories and offering speculation without evidence. We asked the White House for evidence for his statements but heard nothing back. Here\u2019s a guide to the Four-Pinocchio fury.\n\n\u201cThere is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor. Billions of dollars are given each year, with so many lives lost, all because of gross mismanagement of the forests. Remedy now, or no more Fed payments!\u201d\n\n\u2014 Tweet, Nov. 10\n\nAs the most destructive wildfire in California history was raging, Trump pinned the blame on state officials and their \u201cgross mismanagement of the forests.\u201d\n\nHis tweet is wrong on several levels.\n\nFirst, experts say the wildfires besetting the state were not sparked by forest management problems such as an overpopulation of trees or dead trees.\n\n\u201cThe ones in Southern California are burning in chaparral, so it\u2019s not a forest management issue at all,\u201d said LeRoy Westerling, a climate and fire researcher at the University of California at Merced. \u201cThe fire in Northern California didn\u2019t start in forest; it started in other types of vegetation, from what I read. \u2026 There, you\u2019re talking about what kind of vegetation people manage on their homes on private properties.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cIt seems like they\u2019re conflating the forest management issue, which is primarily in federal land in California, with all the other causes of fires in the state, and that doesn\u2019t seem reasonable.\u201d\n\nThat brings us to our second point. Some California forests appear to have many more trees per acre than what is considered healthy, according to an expert cited by the San Francisco Chronicle. But more than half of the state\u2019s forested land is managed by the federal government. The U.S. Forest Service says the \u201crising costs of fighting fires has led [it] to regularly raid its $600 million budget for forest management,\u201d according to the Sacramento Bee.\n\nEven if poor forest management had caused these fires, the ball would be in Trump\u2019s court, not the state government\u2019s.\n\nThird, the scientific consensus is that climate change is the big driver of these intensifying wildfires, although other factors such as forest management play a (smaller) role.\n\nA 2016 study of western U.S. forests published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found \u201chuman-caused climate change caused over half of the documented increases in fuel aridity since the 1970s and doubled the cumulative forest fire area since 1984.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe estimate that human-caused climate change contributed to an additional 4.2 million ha [hectares] of forest fire area during 1984\u20142015, nearly doubling the forest fire area expected in its absence,\u201d authors John T. Abatzoglou and A. Park Williams wrote. \u201cNatural climate variability will continue to alternate between modulating and compounding anthropogenic increases in fuel aridity, but anthropogenic climate change has emerged as a driver of increased forest fire activity and should continue to do so while fuels are not limiting.\u201d\n\nWesterling put it this way: \u201cIt can be exacerbated or compounded by problems in other areas, if you\u2019ve mismanaged vegetation or something like that, [but] we wouldn\u2019t be seeing fires of the kind we\u2019re seeing without climate change.\u201d\n\nFinally, Trump is wrong to claim the federal government sends billions of dollars \u201ceach year\u201d in forest-fire aid to California. The Sacramento Bee in October found \u201cthe U.S. government has spent about $1.4 billion the past two years dealing with wildfires in California.\u201d\n\nTrump blames California for these fires at virtually every turn. He was also wrong in August when he claimed poor water management was feeding the problem, according to an Associated Press fact check.\n\n\u201cRick Scott was up by 50,000+ votes on Election Day, now they \u2018found\u2019 many votes and he is only up 15,000 votes. \u2018The Broward Effect.' How come they never find Republican votes?\u201d\n\n\u2014 Tweet, Nov. 9\n\nTrump\u2019s tweet suggests only votes for Democrats were counted, as he asks \u201chow come they never find any Republican votes?\u201d But guess what? They did! It\u2019s just that more votes were counted for the Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson than for Republican challenger Gov. Rick Scott. Broward tilts heavily toward Democrats, so it would be expected that Democrats would close the margin as votes in the county were tabulated. So far, Nelson has gained about 46,000 votes, compared to about 24,000 for Scott.\n\nTrump might be on stronger ground to complain about Broward\u2019s handling of the process. Brenda Snipes, the Broward County supervisor of elections, over the years has faced lawsuits that have challenged her management record and how votes were counted. Snipes was appointed in 2003 by Gov. Jeb Bush (R) and has been reelected four times.\n\n\u201cThe Florida Election should be called in favor of Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis in that large numbers of new ballots showed up out of nowhere, and many ballots are missing or forged. An honest vote count is no longer possible-ballots massively infected. Must go with Election Night!\u201d\n\n\u2014 Tweet, Nov. 12\n\nTrump oddly suggests only the votes that were counted on Election Day should count, even though that\u2019s not actually feasible in most cases, especially in a state as large as Florida in which more than 8 million ballots were cast. News organizations may \u201ccall\u201d a race, but results are only official when election officials complete the count and certify the numbers.\n\nFlorida law requires a machine recount when the margin is less than 0.5 percentage points. Scott\u2019s lead over Nelson has shrunk to 0.14 percentage points, so it is likely there will also be a hand recount. (The threshold for a hand count is 0.25 points.) In the governor\u2019s race, former congressman Ron DeSantis is ahead of Democratic Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum by 0.41 percentage points, which also triggered a machine recount.\n\nUnder Florida law, vote-by-mail ballots must be received by local supervisors of elections by 7 p.m. on Election Day, though overseas and military ballots are accepted after as long as 10 days after Election Day (in this case Nov. 16), as long as they are postmarked by Election Day. Trump\u2019s tweet on Veterans Day appeared to suggest military votes should not be counted.\n\nDemocrats, citing mail-delivery delays, have filed suit calling for all vote-by-mail ballots that were postmarked before Election Day to be counted. (Miami-Dade County\u2019s election department received 266 ballots that had been found in the Opa-locka mail sorting facility, but for now, they won\u2019t be counted.)\n\nTrump claimed, without evidence, \u201cmany ballots are missing or forged.\u201d The White House did not respond to a request for an explanation. The \u201cmissing\u201d ballots appear to be a reference to social media chatter about a box labeled \u201cprovisional ballots;\u201d it was just pens and other supplies.

Many Indo-Fijians favor Bainimarama, whose new constitution in 2013 removed race quotas from parliament.\n\n\u201cBainimarama\u2019s key success has been to establish the name \u2018Fijian\u2019 for all citizens of Fiji,\u201d said Richard Herr, a professor at Fiji National University who is based in Australia. \u201cHis legislation has made campaigning on race, or even having a racially based party, illegal.\u201d\n\nOn the campaign trail, Bainimarama accused Rabuka of stoking the flames of racism that continue to divide the nation. But some indigenous Fijians believe Rabuka will help restore their prestige, and favor his promise to bring back the nation\u2019s Great Council of Chiefs, which Bainimarama disbanded.\n\nCritics deride Bainimarama as authoritarian, but since forcing himself into power he has refashioned his image into that of a stable, legitimate leader.\n\nHis appeal was bolstered when he assumed the U.N. COP23 presidency in November 2017. In that role, which he holds until December, he shaped Fiji into a pioneer on climate change issues.\n\nWith COP23 as a platform, Fiji inserted small island developing states into the international conversation on climate change. The islands are on the front lines of global warming, rising sea levels, and ocean acidification.\n\nAfter the 2006 coup, Australia and New Zealand imposed sanctions on Fiji, and Bainimarama reoriented regional alliances toward China. His critics accuse him of selling out the country to the Chinese.\n\nThe Lowy Institute says Fiji received about $360 million in aid from China between 2006 and 2016, putting it behind only Papua New Guinea in the Pacific region. China Exim Bank holds 39 percent of Fiji\u2019s externally held public debt, according to The Economist Intelligence Unit.\n\nFiji\u2019s relations have since normalized with Australia and New Zealand, but the period of sanctions enabled China to step up its regional influence.\n\nFiji has one of the healthiest economies of the Pacific Islands, and GDP is predicted to grow above 3 percent annually through 2020. Tourism is the bedrock of the economy, accounting for more than 40 percent of GDP.\n\nBainimarama\u2019s government takes credit for increasing social services, including free primary and secondary education, free bus fares for seniors, and aid in the aftermath of cyclones.\n\nBut widespread poverty persists. Bainimarama\u2019s opponents have vowed to raise the minimum wage, which remains only about $1.25 per hour.\n\nAlthough the coup culture can\u2019t be erased, many argue that Fiji has stabilized under Bainimarama.\n\n\u201cHis prime ministership to date has been marked with a steady movement back towards democracy,\u201d said Pryke, of the Lowy Institute.\n\n\u201cWhile there is still more work to do \u2014 domestic media is engaged in significant self-censorship and opposition parties remain harassed \u2014 the prime minister has delivered on political stability that has enabled economic growth and development progress to be prioritized.\u201d\n\nPolls close at 6 p.m. Wednesday (0500 GMT). As well as Bainimarama\u2019s FijiFirst party and Rabuka\u2019s Social Democratic Liberal Party (Sodelpa), the National Federation Party (NFP) is also expected to be an election contender. In 2014, FijiFirst won 59 percent of votes, Sodelpa won 28 percent, and NFP won 5.5 percent.\n\n___\n\nNick Perry in Wellington, New Zealand, contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

In Iran, the re-imposition of U.S. sanctions last week on oil exports is expected to drive up inflation there to more than 40 percent by year\u2019s end.\n\nThe findings, which came in the IMF\u2019s new regional outlook report, said the overall fiscal deficit for the Mideast\u2019s oil exporters is projected to decline from around $118 billion last year to $41 billion this year, before narrowing to $3 billion in 2019.\n\nFor Saudi Arabia, growth projections remain unchanged despite fallout from the killing of Saudi writer Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul last month. International outrage prompted big name executives and officials to back out from attending a major investment conference in Riyadh after the killing. IMF chief Christine Lagarde was among the high-level participants who pulled out of the summit.\n\nStill, it\u2019s too early to tell what the impact of this could be on the Saudi economy, where the price of oil remains a key determinant, said the IMF\u2019s Mideast and Central Asia director Jihad Azour.\n\n\u201cThere are several more important issues that factor in play. The evolution of oil price. The level of export of oil. The spending in government. The pace of reforms,\u201d Azour told The Associated Press.\n\nThe IMF projects that Saudi Arabia\u2019s economy will see 2.2 percent growth this year and 2.4 percent next year, after shrinking 0.9 percent last year. Saudi Arabia is aiming to balance its budget by 2023.\n\nIran\u2019s economy is expected to contract by 1.5 percent this year and 3.6 percent in 2019, the report said. This comes after Iran\u2019s economy saw growth of 12.5 percent in 2016 and 3.7 in 2017, after sanctions had been temporarily lifted.\n\nAzour said one of the most pressing issues facing Iran is aligning the official local currency exchange rate with black market rates.\n\nThe IMF cautions that global oil prices, while potentially buoyed in the near-term by cuts in Iranian oil supply, are expected to slide down to around $60 a barrel in the next three to four years.\n\nBenchmark Brent crude, which had been trading above $80 a barrel recently, now hovers around $70 after U.S. sanctions waivers for countries that import heavily from Iran, which accounts for 5 percent of global oil exports.\n\n\u201cFor Saudi and other GCC countries, we believe it\u2019s not now the time to be complacent,\u201d Azour said, referring to other Arab oil-exporting countries in the Persian Gulf.\n\nThe IMF is urging oil-exporters in the region to curb subsidies to reduce spending, expand taxes to boost revenue and narrow the public sector wage bill by attracting foreign investment and encouraging the private sector to create more jobs.\n\nThe IMF also warns that at least 25 million new jobs need to be created in the next five years to keep unemployment rates the same across the Middle East, Afghanistan and Pakistan.\n\nAzour said a country like Egypt, where economic growth this year and last exceeded 5 percent, needs to create 700,000 to 1 million new jobs per year to keep it\u2019s unemployment rate from rising.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Rahmat Gul/Associated Press)\n\nKABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 When U.S. forces and their Afghan allies rode into Kabul in November 2001 they were greeted as liberators. But after 17 years of war, the Taliban have retaken half the country, security is worse than it\u2019s ever been, and many Afghans place the blame squarely on the Americans.\n\nThe United States has lost more than 2,400 soldiers in its longest war, and has spent more than $900 billion on everything from military operations to the construction of roads, bridges and power plants. Three U.S. presidents have pledged to bring peace to Afghanistan, either by adding or withdrawing troops, by engaging the Taliban or shunning them. Last year, the U.S. dropped the \u201cmother of all bombs\u201d on a cave complex.\n\nNone of it has worked. After years of frustration, Afghanistan is rife with conspiracy theories, including the idea that Americans didn\u2019t stumble into a forever war, but planned one all along.\n\nMohammed Ismail Qasimyar, a member of Afghanistan\u2019s High Peace Council, wonders how U.S. and NATO forces \u2014 which at their peak numbered 150,000 and fought alongside hundreds of thousands of Afghan troops, were unable to vanquish tens of thousands of Taliban.\n\n\u201cEither they did not want to or they could not do it,\u201d he said. He now suspects the U.S. and its ally Pakistan deliberately sowed chaos in Afghanistan to justify the lingering presence of foreign forces \u2014 now numbering around 15,000 \u2014 in order to use the country as a listening post to monitor Iran, Russia and China.\n\n\u201cThey have made a hell, not a paradise for us,\u201d he said.\n\nAfghanistan is rife with such conspiracy theories. After last month\u2019s assassination of Kandahar\u2019s powerful police chief, Gen. Abdul Raziq, social media exploded with pictures and posts suggesting he was the victim of a U.S. conspiracy. Recent insider attacks, in which Afghan forces have killed their erstwhile U.S. and NATO allies, have attracted online praise.\n\n\u201cIn 2001 the Afghan people supported the arrival of the United States and the international community wholeheartedly,\u201d said Hamid Karzai, who was installed as Afghanistan\u2019s first president and twice won re-election, serving until 2014.\n\n\u201cFor a number of years things worked perfectly well,\u201d he said in a recent interview. \u201cThen we saw the United States either changed course or simply neglected the views of the Afghan people and the conditions of the Afghans.\u201d\n\nHe blames the lingering war on the U.S. failure to eliminate militant sanctuaries in neighboring Pakistan, the bombing of Afghan villages and homes, and the detention of Afghans in raids.\n\nOthers blame the notoriously corrupt government, which Karzai headed for more than a decade, and which is widely seen as yet another bitter fruit of the American invasion.\n\n\u201cAll the money that has come to this country has gone to the people in power. The poor people didn\u2019t get anything,\u201d said Hajji Akram, a day laborer in Kabul\u2019s Old City who struggles to feed his family on around $4 a day. \u201cThe foreigners are not making things better. They should go.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just Afghans. The United States\u2019 own inspector general for Afghanistan\u2019s reconstruction offered a blistering critique in a speech in Ohio earlier this month.\n\nJohn Sopko pointed out that the U.S. has spent $132 billion on Afghanistan\u2019s reconstruction \u2014 more than was spent on Western Europe after World War II. Another $750 billion has been spent on U.S. military operations, and Washington has pledged $4 billion a year for Afghanistan\u2019s security forces.\n\nThe result?\n\n\u201cEven after 17 years of U.S. and coalition effort and financial largesse, Afghanistan remains one of the poorest, least educated, and most corrupt countries in the world,\u201d Sopko said. \u201cIt is also one of the most violent.\u201d\n\nHamidullah Nasrat sells imported fabrics in the capital\u2019s main bazaar on the banks of the Kabul River, a fetid trickle running through a garbage-filled trench. He remembers welcoming the overthrow of the Taliban, who had shut down his photography studio because it was deemed un-Islamic.\n\n\u201cAfter the Taliban we were expecting something good, but instead, day by day, it is getting worse,\u201d he said. \u201cHow is it that a superpower like the United States cannot stop the Taliban? It is a question every Afghan is asking.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. and NATO formally concluded their combat mission in 2014. Since then, the Taliban have carried out near-daily attacks on rural checkpoints and staged coordinated assaults on major cities. Authorities stopped publishing casualty figures earlier this year, deeming them classified. An Islamic State affiliate has meanwhile carried out massive bombings against the country\u2019s Shiite minority.\n\nAfghans who have recently served on the front lines complain of faulty equipment, inadequate supplies and reinforcements that show up late and ill-equipped, if at all.\n\nTameem Darvesh served in the Afghan army for nearly five years in the southern Helmand province. This year he went on holiday and never returned, trading his $180 monthly salary for work as a day laborer making much less. He said morale is at an all-time low, with many soldiers expressing sympathy for the Taliban.\n\nJawad Mohammadi served for more than seven years in the security forces until 2015, when he stepped on a land-mine he was tasked to clear and lost both his legs. He was just 25 years old.\n\nHe recalls how the foreign instructors told him to always check his mine detector by waving it over a piece of metal before heading out into the field. But whenever a device failed to respond, his Afghan commander would tell him to use it anyway.\n\n\u201cI was told that\u2019s all we have. That\u2019s what we were given, you just have to use it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe next time he went out with a faulty device, his foot found a bomb the detector had missed.\n\n\u201cI felt myself being thrown through the air. I looked and I saw my legs were near me and there was so much blood. I yelled: \u2018Please help me.\u2019\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Amir Shah in Kabul, Afghanistan, contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(Ben Margot/AP)\n\nThe 36th game-winning drive in the fourth quarter or overtime of Eli Manning\u2019s NFL career meant absolutely nothing in the big picture. It\u2019s a lost season for the New York Giants, and that won\u2019t change. They beat a team, the San Francisco 49ers, likewise on a road to nowhere. Manning outdueling Nick Mullens is not exactly on the level of besting Tom Brady in a couple of Super Bowls.\n\nBut for Manning and the Giants, it meant quite a bit. Just when it appeared that he had absolutely nothing left, just when it seemed that the Giants might have no choice but to sit him down and give rookie Kyle Lauletta a look at quarterback, Manning provided a rare feel-good moment in what has been a dreary season for him and his team.\n\nHe took the Giants down the field on a stop-and-start final drive and threw a last-minute touchdown pass to give them a 27-23 triumph over the Niners.\n\n[The Cowboys\u2019 win over the Eagles puts most of the NFC East in retreat]\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy to be playing football,\u201d Manning said in a postgame interview with ESPN. \u201cThis is what I love to do. I\u2019ve got great teammates. I\u2019ve had great support. We came out and won a football game. That\u2019s what I told them. I said, \u2018We work too hard not to feel the joys of winning a football game and having a great locker room, have a lot of fun on the plane ride home and hopefully keep this feeling going.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe Giants upped their record to a still miserable 2-7. The Niners\u2019 mark fell to 2-8. This was not exactly a must-see \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d matchup. But the drama of what could be Manning\u2019s final days with the Giants did make it compelling.\n\n\u201cIt has to go to the O-line tonight,\u201d Giants wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. told ESPN on the field after the game. \u201cIt has to go to Eli. Eli was phenomenal. The O-line gave him time \u2026. We just hit some shots. It feels good to get a win.\u201d\n\nThe Giants were coming off their bye week and Pat Shurmur, their first-year head coach, had made no commitment beyond this game to Manning remaining the starter. Certainly the Giants would not repeat last season\u2019s clumsy benching of Manning by Shurmur\u2019s predecessor, Ben McAdoo. But with Manning looking all but done at age 37, fans probably would have been more understanding this time of a change in approach and a switch at the position.\n\nThat\u2019s not necessary now, though, at least for the time being. Manning played well Monday night, connecting on 19 of 31 passes for 188 yards. He threw three touchdown passes, two to Beckham and the game-winner to wideout Sterling Shepard with 53 seconds remaining. He didn\u2019t have an interception and was sacked only once.\n\n\u201cGuys made some great individual plays,\u201d Manning said. \u201cWe did better in the red zone. We still had to kick a couple field goals. But we scored some touchdowns, hit some big plays, ran the ball. We probably didn\u2019t throw it as much as we\u2019ve been throwing it. We stuck with the run and it got us in some third-and-manageable situations and converted some third downs.\u201d\n\nMullens, the second-year undrafted quarterback making his second start for the 49ers because of injuries to Jimmy Garoppolo and C.J. Beathard, threw two interceptions but also passed for 250 yards and a touchdown. He led the Niners to a field goal that gave them a 23-20 lead with 2:46 to play.\n\nManning underthrew a wide-open Beckham on a deep pass earlier in the fourth quarter with the game tied at 20. But when he and the Giants got the ball back in crunchtime, Manning delivered.\n\nHe connected with tight end Evan Engram for a 31-yard gain. A false start pushed the Giants back. But a defensive holding call against the 49ers on a third-and-12 incompletion extended the drive. An offensive holding penalty pushed the Giants back again, but a defensive pass interference call gave them a first down at the San Francisco 35-yard line. From there, completions to rookie tailback Saquon Barkley, Engram and Shepard got the Giants in the end zone.\n\n\u201cWe just had some ups and downs,\u201d Manning said. \u201cWe had some penalties, had a false start on third and seven when we were almost in field goal range. But guys did a good job of getting open. We got a couple of defensive pass interferences and then hit a big play to Saquon there. They finally brought a little pressure and we hit him on a little angle route and made a big play. And then we hit Evan and hit Sterling Shepard. They came with an all-out blitz and we hit Sterling for the touchdown.\u201d\n\nThe Giants had to endure a final flurry in which Mullens got the Niners to the New York 21-yard line, but he sailed an incomplete pass out of the back of the end zone on the final play. It wasn\u2019t exactly a glorious moment for the Giants. But in comparison to most of their season, it felt like one.\n\n\u201cI mean, we\u2019ve lost games [by] four points, three points, a point,\u201d Beckham said. \u201cIt\u2019s just been close games. But that\u2019s the National Football League. You\u2019ve got to find a way to put it together. And tonight we did \u2026. That\u2019s just the way it\u2019s got to be for the rest of the year, man.\u201d\n\nRead more on the NFL:\n\nThe Bills have ended their Nathan Peterman experiment\n\nThe Rams\u2019 defense, Tom Brady\u2019s blitz trouble, and more questions for NFL\u2019s top contenders\n\nThe NFL\u2019s elite is a settled matter, but these challengers have emerged\n\nThe Patriots' path back to the Super Bowl just got more complicated", "Want smart analysis of the most important news in your inbox every weekday along with other global reads, interesting ideas and opinions to know? Sign up for the Today\u2019s WorldView newsletter.\n\nOn Monday, ahead of a visit to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates \u2014 the two monarchies leading a ruinous military intervention in Yemen \u2014 British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt demanded a cease-fire between their forces and the Iran-backed rebel group, the Houthis, which they are fighting.\n\n\u201cThe human cost of war in Yemen is incalculable: With millions displaced, famine and disease rife, and years of bloodshed, the only solution is now a political decision to set aside arms and pursue peace,\u201d Hunt said. His government is pushing for a new Security Council resolution denouncing the war.\n\nMeanwhile, in Washington, Democratic victories in last week\u2019s midterm elections have given more momentum to lawmakers opposed to the Trump administration\u2019s ironclad support for the Saudis. When Democrats take control of the House in January, they probably will ramp up efforts to exercise greater oversight of the intervention, which is backed by American arms and support.\n\nOn a call today with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, @SecPompeo emphasized that the U.S. and Saudi Arabia must hold all of those involved in the killing of Jamal Khashoggi accountable. Secretary Pompeo also called for a peaceful solution to the conflict in Yemen. pic.twitter.com/WzipoTdqKW \u2014 Heather Nauert (@statedeptspox) November 11, 2018\n\nDoes all of this represent a turning point in the war in Yemen? It now seems possible. The killing of dissident Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi has focused international anger on Riyadh and seemingly led the kingdom\u2019s Western allies to reexamine their backing of the intervention, which has killed at least 10,000 people and now has about half the country\u2019s population on the brink of famine, according to the United Nations.\n\n\"We must send an unambiguous, immediate, and tangible message that we expect Riyadh to engage in good faith and urgent negotiations to end the civil war,\u201d wrote Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) and Sen. Todd C. Young (R-Ind.), in a joint statement Friday. \u201cRiyadh must also understand that we will not tolerate the continued indiscriminate airstrikes against civilians and civilian infrastructure that have helped put 14 million Yemenis on the verge of starvation.\u201d\n\nOver the weekend, 30 former senior Obama administration officials circulated a letter calling for President Trump to halt the American role in the conflict. They took responsibility for initiating U.S. support for the war but argued that the situation has deteriorated under Trump, for whom Middle East strategy has revolved largely around confronting Iran and embracing Riyadh and Abu Dhabi.\n\n\u201cWe did not intend U.S. support to the coalition to become a blank check. But today, as civilian casualties have continued to rise and there is no end to the conflict in sight, it is clear that is precisely what happened,\u201d wrote the former officials, including former national security adviser Susan E. Rice and former CIA director John Brennan. \u201cHowever, rather than learning from that failure, the Trump administration has doubled down on support for the Saudi leadership\u2019s prosecution of the war, while removing restrictions we had put in place. It is past time for America\u2019s role in this disastrous war in Yemen to end.\u201d\n\nThe first sign of a concrete shift in policy came on Friday, when it emerged that the administration would stop refueling aircraft from the Saudi-led coalition, which have carried out thousands of sorties over Yemen.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. refueling of coalition aircraft has long been controversial because of the large numbers of civilians that have been killed in coalition airstrikes,\u201d my colleagues reported. \u201cCoalition airstrikes have struck hospitals, health clinics, weddings, funerals, factories and other nonmilitary targets. Human rights groups and The Washington Post have observed fragments of U.S.-made munitions at numerous attack sites.\u201d\n\nThe administration still provides a great deal of other assistance to the coalition, including intelligence sharing, and is reported to be carrying out its own covert missions in Yemen. Some experts nevertheless viewed the announcement as a sign of the shifting winds in Washington.\n\n\u201cThis marks the first time that the United States has taken a concrete measure to rein in the Saudi war effort,\u201d said Bruce Riedel, a former CIA officer who is now a scholar at the Brookings Institution, to my colleagues. \u201cTwo administrations have basically given the Saudis a blank check to do whatever they wanted. Now it will be harder for the Saudis to carry out airstrikes deep into Yemeni territory, going after the capital, for instance.\u201d\n\nOthers were less convinced. \u201cThe U.S. decision to stop refueling coalition aircraft is significant because it implies that the U.S. is trying to distance itself from the devastating impact on civilians of poorly targeted airstrikes,\u201d said Elisabeth Kendall, a Yemen scholar at Oxford University, to The Post\u2019s Sudarsan Raghavan. \u201cBut it is not a military game changer.\u201d\n\n14 million 'on brink of famine' in Yemen: 35 local and international charities warnhttps://t.co/Krjdo4pIVW pic.twitter.com/f8AENzQVNT \u2014 AFP news agency (@AFP) November 8, 2018\n\nInternational attention is now fixed on the battle over the crucial port of Hodeida, the battered gateway for food and medicine for an estimated 80 percent of the country\u2019s population. The coalition believes that taking Hodeida will deliver a crippling blow to the Houthis and force them to the negotiating table. The Saudi-backed coalition has stepped up its offensive on Houthi-held areas of the city, and observers are warning that significant civilian casualties could follow.\n\nU.N.-brokered talks between the warring parties fizzled earlier this year; Saudi and Emirati officials blamed the Houthis for not engaging the process in good faith. But the Houthis argue the same about their adversaries. \u201cSaudi leaders are reckless and have no interest in diplomacy,\u201d wrote the faction\u2019s leader, Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, in a rare op-ed published in The Washington Post. \u201cThe United States has the clout to bring an end to the conflict \u2014 but it has decided to protect a corrupt ally.\u201d\n\nWith both sides entrenched, aid organizations fear the worst. \u201cThere is a need for humanitarian assistance in Yemen,\u201d said Amin Awad, the director of Middle East operations for the U.N.'s refugee agency, at a panel last week in Washington moderated by Today\u2019s WorldView. \u201cThere is no food, there is cholera, and children are continuing to die.

But the interview, which was published in English and Chinese by the official Xinhua News Agency, was cheered by international conservation advocates who saw it as an acknowledgement by Chinese leaders that they made a misstep.\n\n\u201cThe Chinese government has long been dedicated to the cause of wildlife protection and has made achievements recognized by the world,\u201d Xinhua quoted Ding, a top official in China\u2019s State Council, as saying.\n\nChina, Ding added, \u201chas not changed its stance on wildlife protection and will not ease the crackdown on illegal trafficking and trade of rhinos, tigers and their byproducts.\u201d\n\nThe State Council unveiled a directive in late October ending a 25-year ban on trade for rhino and tiger parts \u2014 as long as they were sourced from farmed animals and used for traditional Chinese medicine.\n\nThe announcement sparked an outcry from wildlife advocates, as well as the United Nations, which warned that a resumption of China\u2019s market for tiger and rhino parts \u2014 no matter how narrowly proscribed \u2014 would fuel illegal poaching and devastate wild populations.\n\n[China rolls back decades-old tiger and rhino parts ban]\n\nConservation groups applauded China\u2019s latest reversal, saying it was more consistent with the position that Beijing has carved out in recent years as a leader on wildlife protection, environment and climate change. China was praised last year for banning the elephant ivory trade altogether.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a positive sign that China has heard and responded to the overwhelming concerns from the international community,\u201d said Leigh Henry, director of wildlife policy at the World Wildlife Fund. \u201cIt\u2019s critical now that the ban remains permanent and is expanded to cover trade in all tiger parts and products, and that a commitment is made to phase out China\u2019s tiger farms altogether.\u201d\n\nWildlife advocates speculated in October that China\u2019s move to revive the animal parts market was driven by domestic politics. Some viewed it as a way to promote traditional Chinese medicine, while others saw the measure as the handiwork of China\u2019s tiger farms, which have raised an estimated 6,000 tigers in captivity and seek a market for their goods.\n\nDing, the senior Chinese official, said this week the government would maintain its policy of \u201cthree strict bans,\u201d including a prohibition on the use of tiger and rhino parts for medicine, and appeared to extend an olive branch overseas.\n\n\u201cI would like to reiterate that the Chinese government is willing to work with the international community to jointly strive for protecting wildlife and building our harmonious and beautiful planet,\u201d he said.\n\nRead more:\n\nChina\u2019s push to export traditional medicine may doom the magical pangolin\n\nIvory sales in China finally end this week.

In Iran, the re-imposition of U.S. sanctions on oil exports is expected to drive up inflation there to more than 40 percent by year\u2019s end.\n\nThe IMF also cautions that global oil prices, while potentially buoyed in the near-term by a cut in Iranian oil supply, are projected to slide down to around $60 a barrel by 2021.\n\nBenchmark Brent crude, which had been trading above $80 a barrel recently, now hovers around $70 after some U.S. sanctions waivers for countries that import heavily from Iran, which accounts for 5 percent of global oil exports.\n\n\u201cFor Saudi and other GCC countries, we believe it\u2019s not now the time to be complacent,\u201d said Jihad Azour, the IMF\u2019s Mideast and Central Asia director, referring to other Arab oil-exporting countries in the Persian Gulf.\n\nThe IMF is urging oil-exporters in the region to curb subsidies to reduce spending, introduce more taxes to boost revenue and narrow the public sector wage bill by attracting foreign investment and encouraging the private sector to create more jobs.\n\nThe report warns that at least 25 million new jobs need to be created in the next five years to keep unemployment rates the same across the Middle East, Afghanistan and Pakistan.\n\nAzour said a country like Egypt, where economic growth this year and last exceeded 5 percent, needs to create 700,000 to 1 million new jobs per year to keep it\u2019s unemployment rate from rising.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Yong Teck Lim/Associated Press)\n\nSINGAPORE \u2014 China\u2019s premier sought Tuesday to reassure its neighbors that Beijing will push ahead with reforms needed to support growth across the region and also keep the peace in contested waters in the South China Sea.\n\nPremier Li Keqiang said his government will favor reforms in the world\u2019s No. 2 economy over temporary boosts from economic stimulus as China copes with a gradual slowing of growth and a trade war with the United States.\n\nChina can energize its slowing economy by adjusting policies, such as streamlining procedures like business registrations, taxes and fees, Li said in a lecture on the sidelines of the annual summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations that brings together leaders from the U.S. and across the region.\n\n\u201cDespite the downward pressure, we will not resort to massive stimulus. We will make adjustments as appropriate. We want to energize the market, in particular, market entities, and we have the conditions to do that,\u201d Li said in the wide-ranging speech that touched on China\u2019s role in regional development.\n\nLi said the government also will \u201ccrack down harshly\u201d on businesses that infringe on patents and other intellectual property rights and engage in \u201cother cheating activities.\u201d\n\n\u201cChina will not stop in its opening up. The door will only open wider and China will continue to deepen reform. Reform and opening up have brought China to where it is today,\u201d Li added.\n\nChina and the U.S. are locked in a trade dispute over Washington\u2019s complaints that China uses predatory tactics to acquire technologies that could undermine U.S. industrial leadership. The two countries have raised import duties on billions of dollars of each other\u2019s goods, including soybeans, electric cars and whiskey.\n\nWhile they have rebuffed U.S. demands that Beijing tone down its technology ambitions, China\u2019s leaders have sought to enhance their own market opening credentials by lowering tariffs and easing access for foreign companies operating in China for some industries.\n\nIn the quarter that ended in September, China\u2019s economic growth slowed to 6.5 percent from a year earlier, down from the previous quarter\u2019s 6.7 percent. The deceleration reflects long-term efforts to guide the economy toward a more sustainable model of growth and away from excessive reliance on construction spending and exports. But the trade tensions with Washington are adding to the challenges for the Communist leadership, with the two countries imposing tariffs on billions of dollars of each other\u2019s goods.\n\nLi expressed hopes for a compromise. U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping are to meet at the Group of 20 summit in Argentina this month.\n\n\u201cWe hope that negotiations will be carried out on the basis of mutual respect, balance, mutual benefit and good faith, so that a solution can be found acceptable to both sides,\u201d he said.\n\nThe meetings in Singapore this week will be followed by an annual summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Papua New Guinea.\n\nBoth gatherings address similar concerns about trade, economic integration, regional security and development.\n\nLi also said China was hoping to see within three years a regional \u201ccode of conduct\u201d governing activities in the South China Sea, the location of several territorial conflicts that have raised tensions in the region.\n\nOver U.S. objections, Beijing has moved to cement its claim to most of the South China Sea, including by building artificial islands and military airstrips atop coral reefs. Talks on a code that would belatedly constrain such activities have made slow progress.\n\n\u201cChina and ASEAN countries will benefit in that process. It will also be conducive to free trade and go on to serve the interest of other parties,\u201d Li said.\n\n\u201cI want to reaffirm here that China will stay firm on the course of peaceful development,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we hope is to have a harmonious relationship with our neighbors and together, we benefit from our good neighborliness.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

They were always anonymously delivered, which only made her more fearful and finally drove her to flee.\n\n\u201cIn my country there is violence, a lack of work and opportunities,\u201d said Loly, who like many of the transgender women in the group preferred using only her first name. \u201cIn the caravan there is also violence \u2014 against the LGBTQ community.\u201d\n\nLoly linked up with the caravan in Tapachula, in southern Mexico, and hopes to work in the United States and save up to start a beauty products company \u2014 perhaps in Los Angeles or New York. It\u2019s something she has planned for a long time, all the way down to the business\u2019 logo, but she\u2019s never had the money.\n\n\u201cI am going to a country where I know I will achieve my dreams,\u201d Loly said, hopefully.\n\nReports are common in much of Central America of LGBTQ people being murdered, assaulted and discriminated against, due to their gender identity or sexual orientation.\n\nBut getting U.S. asylum is difficult even with proof someone has been the victim of persecution for being transgender, said Lynly Egyes, director of litigation at the Transgender Law Center in Oakland, California.\n\nIt often takes days or weeks for transgender immigrants to get a hearing before an asylum officer. If they are allowed to move forward in the process, many are traumatized and struggle to tell their story, Egyes said. They are also much less likely to be granted asylum without a lawyer.\n\n\u201cIt is a horrifying process, and not everybody makes it through,\u201d she said.\n\nMany of the migrants have said they joined the caravan because it offered safety in numbers. The 50 or so LGBTQ migrants traveling together, most of them in their 20s but some as young as 17 or as old as 60, say they, too, banded together for safety \u2014 a sort of caravan within the caravan.\n\nSticking out in their bright-colored clothing and makeup, the group has suffered verbal harassment, especially from men, and has been the victim of robbery and other aggressions. One recent day as they walked in a row on the highway to Isla, in the Mexican Gulf coast state of Veracruz, a group of fellow migrants passed by on a flatbed truck and showered them with water, oranges, rinds and other refuse.\n\nFearful of being attacked more violently or sexually assaulted, they stick by each other\u2019s sides 24 hours a day, walking and sleeping in a group and even using the buddy system for going to the bathroom.\n\nIn Matias Romero, in the southern Mexican state of Oaxaca, rather than sleep outdoors they took over an abandoned hotel damaged in last year\u2019s deadly earthquake. Dirty, windowless and with no electricity or running water, it was nonetheless a place to have a roof over their heads and be safe. They bathed by the light of a small lantern, dressed themselves and applied makeup as dozens of men milled about outside.\n\nEach night \u201cthe girls,\u201d as they call themselves, sift through piles of donated clothing to try to look as sharp as possible. And they face a dilemma: Where to dress and relieve themselves?\n\n\u201cWe have problems when it comes time to go to the bathroom,\u201d said Nakai Flotte, a transgender woman and activist. \u201cWe bathe in the men\u2019s, sometimes in the women\u2019s, but it\u2019s difficult. There isn\u2019t one for us.\u201d\n\nFlotte was accompanying the migrants to provide support and information about making asylum claims.\n\nThe U.S. \u201cshould take into account their condition of vulnerability and violence,\u201d she said.\n\nHowever, a decision by then Attorney General Jeff Sessions this year to deny asylum to victims of domestic and gang violence could also have a negative impact on transgender women and men because many are victims of gang violence who are targeted for being transgender.\n\n\u201cI know it will be difficult to win asylum,\u201d said Alexa Amaya, a 24-year-old from Honduras, \u201cbut we have to make the attempt.\u201d\n\nThe caravan has traveled more than 1,000 miles (more than 2,000 kilometers) in the month since its initial participants set out from San Pedro Sula, Honduras, and as it traverses Mexico\u2019s central highlands it\u2019s still about the same distance from its goal of Tijuana, across the border from San Diego. It\u2019s unclear how many will make it. A similar caravan earlier this year fizzled to just about 200 who reached the U.S. frontier.\n\nMuch of the trek has been on foot, but hitching rides in pickup trucks, minibuses and tractor-trailers has been crucial lately, especially on days when they travel 100 miles or more. For the LGBTQ group, it\u2019s been tougher to find those rides.\n\n\u201cA taxi driver kicked us out of his car,\u201d said Lady Perez, a 23-year-old from Honduras, adding that sometimes truck drivers who often transport migrants for a small fee have doubled or tripled the price for her group.\n\nLady began identifying as transgender at age 5, and her father ultimately disowned her. She was subjected to insults and beatings, her boyfriend was killed and she was warned to leave Honduras or else.\n\n\u201cIn our country the rights of the LGBTQ community are not respected, and anti-social groups take advantage of that,\u201d Lady said.\n\nWalking on the highway in a black miniskirt, red lipstick and black eyeliner, she said many men in the caravan have been harassing her and the others.\n\n\u201cThey have denigrated us. Supposedly you\u2019re emigrating from your country because of the violence, the discrimination, the homophobia, and it turns out that in the very caravan you face this kind of violence,\u201d she said.\n\nIn the face of the near-constant harassment, march organizers and human rights workers have sought to provide the group some security in the form of two men in green vests who travel with them and try to ward off any attacks.\n\nIf the verbal harassment doesn\u2019t cross the line, \u201cwe feel protected,\u201d Loly said. \u201cIf someone does cross the line, human rights is with us to protect us.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Astrid Galvan in Phoenix contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

What\u2019s more, schools are reporting that the flow of international students is continuing to shrink this fall. Preliminary data from the nonprofit Institute of International Education show a 1.5 percent drop in new international students arriving on U.S. campuses in the current school year. That marks a third straight year of contraction on a key measure of academic exchange.\n\nMany schools attributed the trend to problems with student visa delays and denials, according to the institute, as well as the U.S. social and political climate and student decisions to enroll outside the United States.\n\nThe new data elicited a worried response from the president of George Mason University in Northern Virginia and from other higher-education leaders in the Washington region and nationwide.\n\n\u201cWhile other countries work hard to attract international students, we are managing to send a message that talented foreigners are not welcome here, just when we most need them,\u201d \u00c1ngel Cabrera, president of George Mason, said in a statement responding to the report.\n\nColleges rely on international students for the tuition they pay and the diverse perspectives they bring.\n\nMany factors influence where foreign students go to school, including the cost of coming to the United States and the growing capacity of higher education systems abroad. But some education leaders say Trump\u2019s advocacy of immigration restrictions, travel bans and a U.S.-Mexico border wall is not helping the nation compete for academic talent in the global market.\n\n[\u2018I\u2019ll be in Canada\u2019: More students are looking to head north]\n\nAt George Mason, Virginia\u2019s largest public university, 8.5 percent of roughly 37,700 students this fall are international. The total has grown steadily in recent years, and university officials want to ensure that it does not recede. Cabrera said foreign students bring hundreds of millions of dollars a year to Virginia\u2019s economy and pay higher out-of-state tuition rates at public institutions, helping to subsidize the education of state residents.\n\nTrump administration officials say the United States remains committed to recruiting and hosting international students. They point to data showing that total international enrollment in the 2017-18 school year reached an all-time high of nearly 1.1 million students, up 1.5 percent from the year before. That figure counts new and continuing students. The total grew because some of the continuing international students remained longer than in years past.\n\nBut the total number of new international students \u2014 including undergraduates, graduate students and others who are not seeking degrees \u2014 was about 272,000. That was down 6.6 percent from the year before and nearly 10 percent from the recent high of about 301,000 in 2015-16.\n\nThe institute\u2019s annual report, known as Open Doors, is funded by the State Department.\n\nCaroline Casagrande, deputy assistant secretary of state for academic programs, told reporters in a conference call that multiple factors explain the drop in new enrollment. She also traced the trend back to decisions potential students were making about college applications in 2014, well before Trump took office.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite frankly unwarranted to say it\u2019s completely the results of a political environment,\u201d Casagrande said, according to a transcript of the call.\n\nMarie Royce, assistant secretary of state for educational and cultural affairs, said Tuesday at the National Press Club that the United States wants to send a message: \u201cAmerica\u2019s academic doors are open and welcoming\u201d to students throughout the world. She said that the nation remains the top destination for international students and that the two-way relationship of student exchange is beneficial for national security.\n\n[The Trump effect on college admissions: Rural outreach increases, international recruiting gets harder]\n\nAllan E. Goodman, the institute\u2019s president and chief executive, said global competition for students is intensifying.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not hearing that students feel they can\u2019t come here,\u201d Goodman said. \u201cWe\u2019re hearing that they have choices. We\u2019re hearing that there\u2019s competition from other countries, and that, in this very sophisticated, very competitive market for the first time, we have real competition.\u201d\n\nAt some universities, international enrollment remains stable.\n\nRobert Groves, provost of Georgetown University, said the Jesuit institution in Washington has not detected any decline in overseas demand. But Groves said he worries that dwindling foreign enrollment could hurt colleges that are struggling to fill seats. \u201cWhen they hurt, all of us hurt in a real way,\u201d he said.\n\nNew York University had about 17,500 international students in the past school year, the report found, more than any other. MJ Knoll-Finn, NYU\u2019s senior vice president for enrollment management, said the total held steady this fall.\n\nNYU officials have taken extra steps recently to ensure those students feel welcome, she said. Faculty members and administrators check in with each one after arrival to see if they have any concerns. \u201cThe culture for them can feel unwelcoming,\u201d Knoll-Finn said. \u201cWe have to do a lot of work to make sure they know that we want them here.\u201d\n\nAt the University of Florida, Provost Joe Glover said there was a precipitous drop this year in international master\u2019s students in engineering. Enrollment fell by a few hundred students, he said, causing a significant budget challenge.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know the exact cause,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are trying to reassure the international market that the university remains committed to providing these programs \u2014 and that the university is a welcoming environment.\u201d\n\nSoon after Trump took office in January 2017, he issued a ban on travelers from several Muslim-majority countries. That upended plans for some students and others seeking to enter the United States. The ban was challenged in court and subsequently revised.\n\nOther administrative proposals and actions, including the phaseout of an Obama-era initiative that protected certain classes of immigrant students from deportation, have contributed to concerns among international students. State Department officials have sought to assuage those concerns, saying the department recognizes that international education is important for the U.S. economy and helps expose Americans to international issues and diverse cultures.\n\nBut higher education leaders say the United States must do more to stay competitive with countries such as Canada and Australia.\n\n\u201cThe concerns about the political climate remain,\u201d said Brad Farnsworth, vice president of internationalization and global management for the American Council on Education. That group represents college and university presidents. \u201cThis is really a global market now for international students, where they have a number of attractive options.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nReport finds fewer new international students on U.S. college campuses\n\nThe Trump effect in college admissions: Rural outreach increases, international recruitment gets harder\n\n\u2018I\u2019ll be in Canada.\u2019: More students are looking to head north\n\nLibyan student, banned from entry to the U.S., is able to return to George Mason\n\nYale professor worries his wife and baby won\u2019t be allowed back from Iran", "U.S. Sen.-elect Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., smiles after her victory over Republican challenger U.S. Rep. Martha McSally, Monday, Nov. 12, 2018, in Scottsdale, Ariz. Sinema won Arizona\u2019s open U.S. Senate seat in a race that was among the most closely watched in the nation, beating McSally in the battle to replace GOP Sen. Jeff Flake. (Rick Scuteri/Associated Press)\n\nIn a year of liberal challenges to President Donald Trump, an avowed centrist scored the Democratic Party\u2019s biggest coup -- flipping a red state\u2019s U.S. Senate seat.\n\nRep. Kyrsten Sinema won the Arizona Senate seat being vacated by Republican Jeff Flake to become the first woman to win a U.S. Senate seat in the state. The race against Republican Rep. Martha McSally was tight enough that a winner wasn\u2019t decided until Monday, after a slow count of mail-in ballots gave her an insurmountable lead.\n\nSinema\u2019s win achieves a longtime Democratic goal of making Arizona, with its growing Latino population, a competitive state. And she did it by pointedly not running against the president, or even critiquing his hardline immigration stance.\n\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t put the progressive bit in her mouth and run with it,\u201d said Chuck Coughlin, a GOP strategist in Phoenix. \u201cShe spit it out and did something else.\u201d\n\nSinema targeted moderate Republican and independent women by painting herself as a nonpartisan problem-solver who voted to support Trump\u2019s agenda 60 percent of the time. Her nearly single-issue campaign talked about the importance of health care and protections for people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nShe knew McSally was vulnerable there because she backed the Republicans\u2019 failed attempt to repeal President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law.\n\nSinema tailored her campaign for conservative-leaning Arizona rather than the national environment, but it may be a guide for Democrats who hope to expand the electoral map in 2020. While some liberals won important races in California, Colorado and Kansas, the left\u2019s highest-profile champions disappointed on Election Day.\n\nRep. Beto O\u2019Rourke fell short in his challenge to Sen. Ted Cruz in Texas. Stacey Abrams trails her Republican opponent in the still undecided bitter Georgia gubernatorial race, and Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, who once led in the polls in the race for Florida governor, is now awaiting the results of a recount.\n\nSinema prevailed while the Democratic candidate for governor, David Garcia, ran as an avowed progressive and got trounced by Republican incumbent Doug Ducey.\n\n\u201cKyrsten was the perfect candidate for this race,\u201d said Democratic strategist Chad Campbell, who previously served with Sinema in Arizona\u2019s state legislature. \u201cWe saw that with Garcia.\u201d\n\nSinema first came to prominence as an openly bisexual Green Party activist in Phoenix, and McSally raked the Democrat over her protests against the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. Sinema was elected as a Democrat to the state legislature in 2004 and carved out a reputation as a liberal who could work with her conservative colleagues.\n\nBy the time she was elected to Congress representing a suburban Phoenix swing district in 2012, Sinema had completely remade herself into a centrist. She voted against Nancy Pelosi as the Democratic leader, supported relaxed regulations on banks and a law to increase penalties on people illegally re-entering the country. She supported a bill making it easier to deport immigrants identified by police as gang members.\n\nDuring the Senate campaign, Sinema stuck to her centrist message, almost robotically at times. She faced only a nominal primary challenge from her left and was free to burnish her nonpartisan credentials, unlike McSally, who faced two primary challengers from the right and tied herself to Trump.\n\nOn Election Day, Sinema swung by Arizona State University\u2019s downtown Phoenix campus to hand out doughnuts and gleefully posed for photos. She has four degrees from the school and teaches two classes there.\n\n\u201cWhat are you going to do for people who are a little more on the left?\u201d voter Petra Morrison asked. The candidate said she wasn\u2019t focused on party labels or ideology. Morrison later told a reporter she was going to vote for Sinema, even though \u201cshe seems to come across as a Democrat in sheep\u2019s clothing.\u201d\n\nThough Sinema wooed moderates, she needed liberals like Morrison in her corner for her win. She benefited from a longtime organizing push by activists who especially targeted the state\u2019s young, growing and Democratic-leaning Latino electorate. \u201cIt\u2019s been 10 years and even more, this mobilization and galvanizing,\u201d said Lisa Magana, a professor in ASU\u2019s School of Transborder Studies.\n\nHistorically Republicans have countered the growth of Arizona\u2019s Hispanic population by winning white voters by ever-bigger margins. But Sinema fought this strategy to a standstill among two key groups of whites -- younger voters and women.\n\nWhite women split their vote between Sinema and McSally, according to AP VoteCast. While whites ages 45 and older favored McSally, those under 45 were evenly divided between the Democrat and Republican. Meanwhile, Latinos favored Sinema by roughly 2 to 1. VoteCast is a nationwide survey of more than 115,000 voters, including 4,128 voters in Arizona.\n\nAnd though Trump\u2019s rhetoric on immigration seemed pitched to Arizona voters\u2019 anxieties about the border, both Democratic and Republican polls throughout the race showed the president had more people disapproving of him.\n\nTrump visited only once on McSally\u2019s behalf in mid-October. The following week, Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego said there was a notable spike in Latinos returning their early ballots; most Arizona residents vote by mail.\n\n\u201cIt was like they spent the weekend at the kitchen table\u201d filling out the ballots in anger, Gallego said.\n\nAnnette Villelas was one of those angry voters. She registered for the first time so she could vote for Democrats and against Trump. It wasn\u2019t just the way the president deals with immigrants, she said after shaking Sinema\u2019s hand at a Phoenix taco shop.\n\n\u201cThe way he talks just to the public, it\u2019s not right,\u201d Villelas said. \u201cI want to vote and get him out and get someone in for the people.\u201d\n\nRon Horsford, a 50-year-old Republican, was at the same event and said he was excited to vote for Sinema. He liked her message of \u201cI\u2019m going to work with the other side.\u201d\n\nThe question for Democrats in Arizona is whether they can attract voters like Horsford and Villelas in 2020. Not only does the party hope it can put the state in play in the presidential race, voters will get their first chance to select John McCain\u2019s successor. Republican Sen. Jon Kyl, who was appointed after McCain\u2019s death, has pledged not to run.\n\nDespite its image as a staunch Republican bastion, Arizona is attracting younger, educated voters from elsewhere in the United States. In this election, Democrats expanded their share in the state Legislature, though they\u2019re still the minority. They took a 5-4 majority in the state\u2019s congressional seats and remain competitive in two down-ballot and uncalled statewide races.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

She has become best friends with a wonderful girl who is at the school on a scholarship. My daughter's friend is passing her classes but not getting great grades and is losing her scholarship next year. Her family cannot afford the tuition and are planning to send her to the public school in their neighborhood next year.\n\nMy husband and I are lucky enough that we can afford it, so we offered to pay for her tuition, but her mom told us she wouldn't feel right accepting that.\n\nI think we should fund a scholarship at the school, urge the friend to apply, then pull some strings to get her chosen for the scholarship. My husband thinks we need to take her mom's no for an answer.\n\nThis young lady is both the best friend my daughter has ever had and a bright young girl who could really benefit from this school, which has far more resources to help her get college scholarships than her public school would. Should I keep trying on this, or is my husband right that I've done enough?\n\n\u2014 Trying\n\n\n\n(Nick Galifianakis for The Washington Post)\n\nTrying: Short answer: Your husband is right that you\u2019ve done enough. Any more risks interfering in this family\u2019s business.\n\nLong answer: There might be a bigger problem here, beyond this one friend, that your compassion and cash could help address. How well does Bucks Academy support the scholarship kids? Obviously the correlation isn\u2019t 1-to-1, that a lower-income student automatically presents an achievement-gap problem. However, that correlation is quite common, disturbingly so in 2018 America, especially if the prior school is an underperformer.\n\nIf this friend is representative of such a gap at this school, and if the school uses its scholarship money in hopes of closing such gaps, then a parent of means might be able to do some lasting good by kick-starting (or expanding) a tutoring/mentoring program for kids who need extra support during their transition, particularly if said school has radically higher academic expectations of these kids than their prior schools did. (Now that\u2019s a sentence.)\n\nThis is kind of answering a different question from the one you asked . . . but maybe going to the school, citing the example of your daughter\u2019s friend and floating the idea of a program to support bright kids who have adjustment struggles \u2014 a program for which you offer seed money \u2014 could also become a non-meddlesome way to make the case for the school\u2019s giving this friend another chance. And boy, do these schools listen to people who walk in with money, alas, unless they have so much they can afford not to.\n\nYou could also donate that spare tuition money to public schools, to boost their college counseling staffs.\n\nRe: Trying: Good answer! My two cents as someone who has worked in financial aid, about \"pull some strings\": It doesn't operate that way. A donor can offer some preferred selection criteria, but once funds are in hand, the school decides the use of its resources.\n\n\u2014 Anonymous\n\nRe: Trying: I hate to say it, but at my school it absolutely does work that way, at least if the donor is wealthy/generous enough.\n\n\u2014 Saying It\n\nSaying It: Sigh. Thanks.", "FILE - In this July 26, 2018, file photo, Cincinnati Bengals defensive coordinator Teryl Austin participates during NFL football practice, in Cincinnati. The Bengals have fired defensive coordinator Teryl Austin, Monday, Nov. 12, 2018, and put head coach Marvin Lewis in charge of an historically bad unit. The Bengals lost to the Saints 51-14 on Sunday, one of the worst showings in franchise history. (John Minchillo, File/Associated Press)\n\nCINCINNATI \u2014 Marvin Lewis got the Bengals\u2019 head coaching job because of his reputation for defensive excellence. He\u2019s now in charge of trying to resuscitate a historically bad unit and pulling Cincinnati\u2019s season back from the brink.\n\nThe Bengals fired defensive coordinator Teryl Austin on Monday, a day after a 51-14 loss to the Saints that ranks among the worst in franchise history. New Orleans scored on every possession except the last one \u2014 when it took a knee while in field-goal range \u2014 during its rout at Paul Brown Stadium.\n\nThe fading Bengals (5-4) fired a coordinator in midstream for the second season in a row. And it\u2019s up to Lewis to get hands-on and try to fix the mess while filling two roles at once.\n\n\u201cTeryl worked very hard, but I just felt like we have to rock their world, shake things up,\u201d Lewis said.\n\nThe timing was curious. The Bengals were coming off their bye week that would have given them time to adapt to a change at coordinator. Now, they\u2019re changing on the fly while getting ready for a pivotal AFC North game at Baltimore (4-5) on Sunday.\n\nLewis made another interesting move, re-hiring fired Browns coach Hue Jackson, who served as his offensive coordinator in 2014 and 2015. Jackson, who was dismissed by Cleveland on Oct. 29 after winning just three games in two-plus seasons, will take on an unspecified role within Lewis\u2019 staff, a person familiar with the decision told The Associated Press on Monday night.\n\nThe person spoke on condition of anonymity because the team has not announced Jackson\u2019s addition.\n\nThe Bengals host the Browns on Nov. 25.\n\nLewis took the defense aside a few times on Sunday, trying to clear up confusion. While he won\u2019t change the defensive schemes, he\u2019ll try to bring more clarity to players\u2019 responsibilities.\n\n\u201cThey want help: \u2018Give me something,\u2019\u201d Lewis said.\n\nThe Bengals have given up at least 500 yards in three straight games \u2014 a first in the Super Bowl era \u2014 and are on pace to give up an NFL record for yards in a season . In the past four games, Cincinnati has allowed 481, 551, 576 and 509 yards.\n\nLewis has one thing in his favor: The schedule is far more favorable the rest of the way.\n\nCincinnati has faced six offenses currently ranked in the league\u2019s Top 10 \u2014 Tampa Bay (No. 1), Kansas City (3), Pittsburgh (4), New Orleans (5), Atlanta (6) and Indianapolis (9). Only two are left on the schedule: the Chargers (8) and the Steelers again.\n\nWith three losses in the past four games, Cincinnati has fallen from first place to trailing Pittsburgh (6-2-1) by two games in the loss column. They can\u2019t afford to fall any further behind, which was a factor in the firing.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying to get things fixed now,\u201d defensive end Carlos Dunlap said. \u201cIf you weren\u2019t paying attention, you\u2019re paying attention now.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the second time during his 16-season tenure in Cincinnati that Lewis has gotten directly involved in the defense.\n\nThe Bengals hired him in 2003 in large part because of his reputation for defensive coaching \u2014 he coordinated the Ravens\u2019 Super Bowl-championship defense in the 2000 season. Defense has been a regular challenge during his tenure.\n\nLewis became so frustrated with the defense in 2004 that he took over play-calling from coordinator Leslie Frazier during a game against Cleveland. The Bengals lost 34-17 and Lewis left the defense in Frazier\u2019s hands the rest of the way, and then fired him after the season.\n\nNow, he\u2019s back in charge.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not playing well, so something had to change,\u201d safety Jessie Bates said.\n\nLewis hired Austin from Detroit after defensive coordinator Paul Guenther left to join Jon Gruden with the Raiders. The Bengals gave up a lot of yards while opening the season 4-1, with the defense scoring four touchdowns off fumble and interception returns to overcome the poor showings overall.\n\nWith injuries sapping the defense during a stretch of games against the NFL\u2019s top offenses, the unit imploded. The Saints scored touchdowns on all five first-half possessions Sunday, and moved the ball easily even when they were running out the clock in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe Bengals matched the club record by giving up 28 points in the second quarter. The 51 points allowed were one shy of the club record.\n\nAustin is the fourth coordinator fired in the NFL this season. Tampa Bay fired defensive coordinator Mike Smith, Arizona fired offensive coordinator Mike McCoy, and the Browns fired head coach Hue Jackson and offensive coordinator Todd Haley.\n\nJackson has a close relationship with Lewis, who has declined to discuss whether he\u2019d bring him back to Cincinnati. Jackson coached on both offense and defense in Cincinnati.\n\nLast year, the Bengals fired offensive coordinator Ken Zampese after an 0-2 start, but the Bengals missed out on the playoffs for the second year in a row. Lewis got a two-year contract extension after the season even though he\u2019s 0-7 in the playoffs \u2014 an NFL record for futility.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Tom Withers in Cleveland contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The president has grumbled for months about what he views as Nielsen\u2019s lackluster performance on immigration enforcement and is believed to be looking for a replacement who will implement his policy ideas with more alacrity.\n\nThe announcement could come as soon as this week, three of these officials said.\n\nTrump has changed his mind on key personnel decisions before, and Chief of Staff John F. Kelly is fighting Nielsen\u2019s pending dismissal and attempting to postpone it, aides say. But Kelly\u2019s future in the administration also is shaky, according to three White House officials.\n\nDHS officials who work with Nielsen declined to address her potential departure Monday. \u201cThe Secretary is honored to lead the men and women of DHS and is committed to implementing the President\u2019s security-focused agenda to protect Americans from all threats and will continue to do so,\u201d spokesman Tyler Q. Houlton said in a statement.\n\nNielsen has been reluctant to leave the administration before reaching the one-year mark as secretary on Dec. 6, but she has been unhappy in the job for several months, according to colleagues. Trump has berated her during Cabinet meetings, belittled her to other White House staff and tagged her months ago as a \u201cBushie,\u201d a reference to her previous service under President George W. Bush and meant to cast suspicion on her loyalty.\n\n[Trump unloads on Homeland Security secretary in lengthy immigration tirade]\n\nWhen Nielsen has tried to explain the laws and regulations that prevent the government from drastically curtailing immigration or closing the border with Mexico, as Trump has suggested, the president has grown impatient and frustrated, aides said.\n\nNielsen\u2019s departure would leave a leadership void at the government\u2019s third-largest agency, which has 240,000 employees and a $60 billion budget. The deputy secretary job at DHS has been vacant since April, and the White House has not submitted to Congress a nomination for that post.\n\nUnless Trump were to name another official to lead DHS in an acting capacity, the day-to-day task of running the agency would fall to Claire M. Grady, the undersecretary for management.\n\nTrump has told White House officials that he has begun contemplating replacements for Nielsen. He could name one of the agency\u2019s other Senate-confirmed principals, such as Kevin Mc\u00adAleenan, the commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, or David P. Pekoske, administrator of the Transportation Security Administration and a former vice commandant of the Coast Guard.\n\n\u201cIf I were advising the White House, I\u2019d encourage them to nominate someone with executive branch experience,\u201d said one senior DHS official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share candid views about his agency\u2019s leadership. \u201cThis will be our fourth secretary in two years. The last thing we want is someone who needs hand-holding.\u201d\n\nKris Kobach\u2019s loss in the Kansas governor\u2019s race has generated speculation that Trump could attempt to nominate him as a replacement for Nielsen, but Kobach, Kansas\u2019s secretary of state, remains a polarizing figure whose hard-line views \u2014 especially on immigration \u2014 are considered by many observers to be too extreme to win Senate confirmation.\n\nColleagues who\u2019ve worked closely with Nielsen and defend her performance at DHS say working for Trump on immigration issues is miserable because the president has an unrealistic view of border security and little patience for the intricacies of U.S. immigration law.\n\nNielsen was selected for the DHS job by Kelly, and her imminent departure is another indication that his influence over personnel decisions has waned. Kelly has defended her repeatedly, and aides have grown annoyed at their close relationship \u2014 he often praises her impromptu in senior staff meetings while not praising other Cabinet members.\n\n[\u2018Close the whole thing!\u2019: Border tensions boil over as Trump\u2019s frustrations grow]\n\nFormer colleagues who worked with Nielsen were astonished when Kelly pushed to install her at DHS because she had never led a large organization, let alone one with so many responsibilities. Nielsen worked on disaster-management response in the Bush White House, then in the private sector and academia as a cybersecurity expert before returning to DHS to work as chief of staff under Kelly when he was homeland security secretary during Trump\u2019s first six months in office.\n\nBut it was immigration enforcement that became one of Trump\u2019s biggest frustrations, and the president has blamed her for a rebound this year in the number of people arrested along the Mexican border.\n\nAt the peak of controversy over the Trump administration\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d family-separation initiative, Nielsen nonetheless stood at the White House lectern and delivered a vigorous defense of the measures. The president loved her performance \u2014 especially when she said there was no administration policy on separations. Days later, under withering criticism, the president changed his mind and ordered an end to the separations.", "Republicans are sowing skepticism about the electoral process in states with votes that are too close to call, echoing President Trump\u2019s unsubstantiated allegations of voter fraud and suggesting that election officials should jettison the common practice of completing vote counts after Election Day.\n\nNowhere is the effort more aggressive than in Florida, where Gov. Rick Scott is tapping the powers of his administration to defend his slender lead in the U.S. Senate race and accusing Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson of \u201ctrying to steal an election.\u201d Without evidence, Trump on Twitter claimed ballots were \u201cmassively infected\u201d in Florida and said the recount should halt \u2014 though it is mandated by state law and overseas military ballots aren\u2019t due until Friday.\n\nWhat appears to be a coordinated Republican strategy to undercut post-election vote counting is also evident in New Mexico, where Rep. Yvette Herrell (R) is refusing to concede her race to Democrat Xochitl Torres Small after absentee ballots changed her status from winner to loser, and in Arizona, where the National Republican Senatorial Committee contended a county election official had been \u201cusing his position to cook the books\u201d for Democrat Kyrsten Sinema.\n\nCombined with accusations of voter suppression in the Georgia governor\u2019s race, public faith in the electoral system is being put to the test.\n\n\u201cThese public announcements are doing nothing but hyping the hysteria and lessening the credibility of our elections process and, by extension, democracy itself,\u201d said Ion Sancho, a prominent retired elections official and political independent from Leon County, Fla.\n\nQuestions about the integrity of the elections system have cropped up in recent years as a number of states have passed laws that Republicans say weed out illegal voters and Democrats say disenfranchise eligible ones. Before his election, Trump claimed that the 2016 vote would be \u201crigged,\u201d but as president he has dismissed evidence that Russians tried to influence the outcome.\n\n\n\nElection workers sort ballots Monday in Lauderhill, Fla. (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)\n\nThis year\u2019s midterm elections have unleashed a new level of vitriol over the results in certain closely fought races \u2014 particularly where late ballot counts have shrunk the lead of the Republican. These slower counts, which for the most part have occurred in large, predominantly Democratic counties, have produced new votes for Republicans, too \u2014 albeit fewer than for Democrats in the blue strongholds where the counting has taken the longest.\n\nIn Arizona, Sinema was slightly behind Rep. Martha McSally (R) on election night in the race to replace retiring Sen. Jeff Flake (R). But as officials there continued to count ballots, she sprang into the lead. On Monday, the Associated Press declared Sinema the winner, with 38,197 more votes than McSally.\n\nIn Florida, Scott\u2019s lead over Nelson has narrowed to 12,562 votes out of more than 8 million ballots cast, or a margin of 0.15 percent, according to an unofficial tally Saturday. State law mandates a machine recount if the margin is half a percentage point or smaller and a manual recount if the margin is a quarter of a point or smaller. Counties are racing to meet a Thursday deadline to finish the machine recount.\n\nSome Republicans have defended Trump\u2019s and Scott\u2019s heated language.\n\n\u201cThe rhetoric of Trump and Gov. Scott is warranted because candidates and voters have a right to know how election officials are conducting business,\u201d said Dan Eberhart, a fundraiser for Scott and former Florida congressman Ron DeSantis. \u201cTrump\u2019s severe rhetoric draws attention to blatant failures in the system.\u201d\n\nScott has called on state law enforcement to investigate heavily Democratic Broward and Palm Beach counties, citing potential vote-counting confusion but providing no evidence of outright fraud. Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, a fellow Republican, echoed the governor\u2019s request and argued that state law enforcement has a \u201cduty\u201d to investigate. Scott also has ordered sheriffs around the state to police the recounts and has filed lawsuits to try to force Broward and Palm Beach counties to essentially treat their elections offices as crime scenes.\n\nNational Republican figures backing Scott, including Sens. Marco Rubio (Fla.) and Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.), are holding daily briefings to raise questions about the integrity of the election.\n\nFormer Florida governor Jeb Bush also joined the fray Monday, saying there was \u201cno question\u201d that Broward Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes has broken the law and that she should be removed from office after the recounts.\n\nA pro-Trump political committee is throwing $250,000 behind an attack ad against Snipes on television in southern and central Florida and online. \u201cLegal voters in Florida are outraged, and Brenda Snipes must be removed,\u201d says the ad by Great America PAC, which suggests blatant fraud with no evidence. \u201cWhen we can\u2019t trust our elections, we don\u2019t have a democracy.\u201d\n\nState law allows the governor to suspend an elections supervisor for malfeasance or incompetence and appoint a replacement. Snipes was appointed by Bush in 2003 after he ousted her predecessor for mismanagement; she since has been reelected four times.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been a target like this in my life,\u201d Snipes said. \u201cThere is no rampant fraud here.\u201d\n\nSo far, courts and state agencies are resisting Scott\u2019s demands to intervene in the recount. In Broward, a state judge on Monday rejected Scott\u2019s request to have ballots and machines not used in the recount be impounded, admonishing him to \u201cramp down the rhetoric\u201d and let elections workers do their job. The secretary of state, which is in charge of monitoring elections, has said the office has found no evidence of criminal activity.\n\nThe governor\u2019s use of his bully pulpit is provoking appeals that he recuse himself from the vote counting \u2014 not only from Nelson, but also the Florida League of Women Voters. The organization, which alleged that Scott \u201cintentionally politicized governance of the election,\u201d filed a lawsuit Monday demanding that he remove himself from the recount process.\n\nNational and state election officials also sounded alarms about heated rhetoric coming from the governor and the White House.\n\n\u201cProviding clear and accurate assessments of elections is crucial when you are dealing with voter confidence,\u201d said Maria Benson of the National Association of Secretaries of State, which calls itself the nation\u2019s oldest nonpartisan professional group for public officials. \u201cWhen you plant that seed like that, it\u2019s hard to take it back.\u201d\n\nRonald Labasky, executive director of the Florida State Association of Supervisors of Elections, another nonpartisan group, called the claims of voter fraud \u201cirresponsible\u201d in light of the lack of evidence. \u201cAllegations of this nature do make people question whether the process is fair and the result is correct,\u201d he said.\n\nThe White House did not respond to requests for evidence of fraud or to questions about whether Trump thinks the votes of military members serving overseas should be counted.\n\nAnother issue is the handling of 205 votes in Broward County, from voters who were forced to cast provisional ballots on Election Day because connectivity issues prevented the county system from verifying their registration \u2014 even though phone calls to the central election office confirmed that they were all registered.\n\nOn the night of the election, those provisional ballots were taken out of their envelopes, counted and set aside. But it was later determined that 20 of those ballots were ineligible because of mismatched signatures on the envelopes. Republicans are insisting that all 205 ballots must be thrown out; Democrats are demanding they count.\n\n\u201cI think the takeaway, fairly or not, from Florida to Georgia to Arizona, is Republicans continue to try to suppress the vote and Democrats continue to try to turn it out,\u201d said former Florida congressman David Jolly, who recently left the GOP to become an independent. \u201cCurrent political leaders making these false allegations in itself is a failure of leadership. . . .

After the unofficial tally was posted Saturday, he expressed his \u201cappreciation\u201d to all the election supervisors in the state and said he was focused on transitioning into the governor\u2019s office.\n\nBoth Republicans and Democrats have questioned why Scott would allege fraud in an election many expect him to win. Scott was surprised when DeSantis, a Republican former congressman from the Daytona Beach area running for governor, garnered more votes than a two-term governor, said one Republican familiar with the party\u2019s strategy discussions.\n\nScott also has been hard-pressed to answer questions about why he didn\u2019t remove Snipes, the Broward elections supervisor, in 2016, when she was accused of destroying ballots in a congressional election while a lawsuit was pending.\n\nA Pew survey this fall found Americans seeing voter suppression, in principle, as a bigger problem than voter fraud. A 58 percent majority said that if one out of a million eligible voters was improperly prevented from voting, it would be a \u201cmajor problem\u201d for the election, compared with 41 percent who said it would be a major problem if one person voted despite lacking eligibility.\n\nAlice Crites, Lori Rozsa, Felicia Sonmez, Scott Clement and John Wagner contributed to this report.", "House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi is moving aggressively to snuff out a challenge from some lawmakers who are demanding new party leadership, while powerful allies outside Congress are helping rally support for her bid for speaker.\n\nPelosi has yet to clinch the necessary votes and is leaving nothing to chance, according to members and aides familiar with her approach.

But members and aides involved in the push to unseat her say they are soliciting signatures for a letter that would make clear that Pelosi cannot win a floor vote.

Many migrants say they are fleeing rampant poverty, gang violence and political instability primarily in the Central American countries of Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua. (Rodrigo Abd/Associated Press)\n\nGUADALAJARA, Mexico \u2014 The U.S. government said it was starting work Tuesday to \u201charden\u201d the border crossing from Tijuana, Mexico, to prepare for the arrival of a migrant caravan leapfrogging its way across western Mexico.\n\nCustoms and Border Protection announced it was closing four lanes at the busy San Ysidro and Otay Mesa ports of entry in San Diego, California.\n\nIt said the closures were needed \u201cto install and pre-position port hardening infrastructure equipment in preparation for the migrant caravan and the potential safety and security risk that it could cause.\u201d\n\nThat still leaves a substantial path for the tens of thousands of people who cross daily: Twenty-three lanes remain open at San Ysidro and 12 at Otay Mesa.\n\nSan Ysidro is the border\u2019s busiest crossing, with about 110,000 people entering the U.S. every day. That traffic includes some 40,000 vehicles, 34,000 pedestrians and 150 to 200 buses.\n\nThe caravans became a campaign issue in U.S. midterm elections and U.S. President Donald Trump has ordered the deployment of over 5,000 military troops to the border to help fend off the migrants. Trump has insinuated without proof that there are criminals or even terrorists in the group.\n\nTo the thousands of Central American migrants making their way toward Mexico\u2019s Pacific coast state of Nayarit, the prospect of meeting a hostile reception at the border is nothing new.\n\nAfter a month on the road, through three countries, migrants like Maribel, 22, from La Ceiba, Honduras, are used to tough conditions.\n\nMaribel, who did not want her last name used for fear of reprisals in Honduras, pushed a baby carriage with her 1-year-old daughter while her husband pushed another with their 3-year-old son along a highway leading from Guadalajara to the Nayarit state capital of Tepic. Few trucks passed, and migrants felt stranded.\n\n\u201cWe are well aware of everything Trump has been saying,\u201d said Maribel. \u201cLet them close whatever they want to close, but we are going to get through anyway.\u201d\n\nAbout 1,300 migrants in a second caravan arrived in Mexico City, where they had their first day of rest in weeks Tuesday.\n\nRoberto Hernandez, 39, a bricklayer from San Pedro Sula, Honduras, was finally able to get a shot of antibiotics for the fever he has had for two weeks. He was staying at the same tent shelters set up for the first caravan at a sports stadium in Mexico City.\n\n\u201cEver since I left home I knew it wasn\u2019t going to be easy,\u201d said Hernandez, who sobbed quietly as he thought of the two sons, Mateo and Steven, he left at home. \u201cThey can put a million soldiers or whatever they want on the border, we are going to make the attempt to get across.\u201d\n\nBut things were especially tough for the first caravan. The estimated 4,000 Central Americans left shelters in Guadalajara early Tuesday and were taken by bus to a highway tollbooth to wait for rides to their next destination.\n\nThey thought other buses would be waiting for them to take them through hurricane-ravaged Nayarit to the neighboring state of Sinaloa, farther north. But no other buses showed up and few trucks passed to pick them up, leaving many to walk the 60 miles (90 kilometers) to the state line.\n\nMaria Antonia Martinez, 40, of Ocotepeque trudged along with her 7-year-old daughter after failing to get a ride.\n\n\u201cThey told it was five kilometers (three miles), and that wasn\u2019t true,\u201d Martinez said, after walking five hours in the burning sun along an empty highway.\n\nCristobal Sanches, an activist traveling with the caravan, said Jalisco state officials had promised Monday night to take the migrants to the border with Nayarit. Some migrants initially refused to get off the buses that took them to the toll plaza, but police arrived and threatened them to exit the buses.\n\nJalisco Gov. Aristoteles Sandoval said Thursday the state had never agreed to transport them to Nayarit.\n\n\u201cThere was never any suggestion of supporting them economically,\u201d Sandoval said. \u201cThey wanted to be taken to another state, that can\u2019t be done.\u201d\n\nThe first caravan appeared intent on taking the Pacific coast route northward to the border city of Tijuana, which was still about 1,350 miles (2,200 kilometers) away. The migrants have come about 1,500 miles (2,400 kilometers) since they started out in Honduras around Oct. 13.\n\nHowever, some small groups broke off along the way and went on ahead, either using buses, trains or long-haul truck rides to get to the border quicker. Police reported about 350 migrants arrived in the Baja California border city of Tecate, near Tijuana on Tuesday.\n\nMany say they are fleeing rampant poverty, gang violence and political instability primarily in the Central American countries of Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua.\n\nMexico has offered refuge, asylum or work visas, and its government said Monday that 2,697 temporary visas had been issued to individuals and families to cover them during the 45-day application process for more permanent status. Some 533 migrants had requested a voluntary return to their countries, the government reported.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Mark Stevenson in Mexico City contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Buffalo announced Monday that it had released the second-year quarterback.\n\nAfter a rough rookie campaign that featured a memorably disastrous debut, in which Peterman threw five interceptions against the Chargers before being benched at halftime, he showed little to no improvement this season. His interception percentage fell from 10.2 to a still-abysmal 8.6 \u2014 with two picks returned for touchdowns \u2014 while his touchdown percentage (4.1 to 1.2) and yards per attempt (5.1 to 3.7) fell more sharply.\n\nThe final straw for Buffalo was watching Matt Barkley, a veteran quarterback signed less than two weeks ago, get a start Sunday against the Jets and perform far better than Peterman ever did, while leading the team to a resounding road win. The Bills' website called that performance \u201cinspiring\u201d while announcing the release of Peterman, and it noted that while the latter was \u201cremarkably efficient\u201d in preseason action, he \u201ccould never carry that level of play into the regular season.\u201d\n\nNathan Peterman\u2019s passer rating from a clean pocket is 36.4.

You get a 39.6 for spiking the ball every play. \u2014 George Chahrouri (@PFF_George) November 6, 2018\n\nBarkley was added amid injuries to quarterbacks Josh Allen and Derek Anderson, and Peterman\u2019s release could signal that Allen, selected seventh overall in April\u2019s draft, is close to returning from an elbow injury that sidelined him for several weeks. The Bills are heading into their bye week, and Coach Sean McDermott said Monday that Allen would be behind center in Week 12 if he is ready to go.\n\n\u201cJosh is our starter, when healthy, and his development is important for him and for us moving forward,\u201d McDermott said (via ESPN). \u201cGetting experience \u2014 you\u2019ve seen a lot of quarterbacks this season play \u2014 and it\u2019s important that he gets as many reps as he can get in live game action.\u201d\n\nMcDermott also said he was \u201cstill confident in Nate,\u201d but those comments came earlier in the day. Apparently a few more hours of reflection changed his mind, and the Bills' website pointed to a numbers game, with Peterman the odd man out from a four-quarterback group.\n\nPeterman, 24, was the Bills' fifth-round draft pick in 2017 out of Pittsburgh.

(Ng Han Guan, File/Associated Press)\n\nBEIJING \u2014 China is postponing its decision to allow trading in tiger and rhinoceros parts a bare two weeks after the easing of the ban had raised fears the country was giving legal cover to poaching and smuggling of endangered wildlife.\n\nThe official Xinhua News Agency quoted Cabinet official Ding Xuedong as saying Monday that the change had \u201cbeen postponed after study.\u201d\n\n\u201cRelevant departments of the Chinese government will soon continue to organize special crackdown campaigns with focus on addressing the illegal trade of rhinos, tigers and their byproducts. Illegal acts will be dealt with severely,\u201d Ding, an executive deputy secretary-general of the State Council was quoted as saying.\n\nThe Xinhua report said the ban on the import and export of rhino and tiger parts and their use in traditional Chinese medicine would also be maintained. Ding\u2019s comments did not address whether the postponement meant the decision would be revived.\n\nThe traditional medicinal uses of tiger bone and rhino horn have continued despite no proof of their effectiveness and the decreasing wild populations. China has also long tolerated the farming of tigers and the semi-legal sale of their parts.\n\nLate last month, authorities said they would allow trading in products made from tigers and rhinos under \u201cspecial circumstances,\u201d bringing condemnation from conservation groups. Farming of non-native rhinos is not known in China but the changing law raised speculation it was being planned.\n\nThe World Wildlife Fund said overturning the ban would have \u201cdevastating consequences globally\u201d by allowing poachers and smugglers to hide behind legalized trade.\n\nChina\u2019s authoritarian Communist Party-led government rarely responds to international pressure and the reversal appeared to reflect concerns over the country\u2019s reputation as a supporter of environmental preservation. China, home to the highly endangered giant panda, has frequently been named as a top market for endangered wildlife products including ivory and skin from African elephants and meat and scales from the anteater-like pangolin, native to Africa and southern Asia.\n\nReacting to the latest development, the Humane Society International and the Humane Society of the United States called for China to completely ban the trade in tiger and rhino products.\n\n\u201cTo truly protect tigers and rhinos we need an official written proclamation from the State Council that permanently reinstates a complete ban. Full stop,\u201d Iris Ho, senior specialist for Wildlife Program and Policy at Humane Society International was quoted as saying in a news release. \u201cSpecies extinction is irreversible and we cannot afford any missteps,\u201d Ho said.\n\nAlong with other animal protection organizations, the Humane Society International and the Humane Society of the United States have filed a legal appeal for a ban on U.S. imports of all wildlife and their parts from China \u201cunless or until China formally reinstates a complete ban on domestic trade in tigers and rhinos and their parts and products,\u201d the groups said in a statement.\n\nAn estimated 3,890 tigers remain alive in the wild, according to a report presented during the Third Asia Ministerial Conference on Tiger Conservation in 2016.

(Marlene Awaad/Bloomberg News)\n\n\u2014President Trump, noting his own\n\nsacrifice during World War I centennial\n\nobservance Sunday.\n\nOn Veterans Day, Americans recall the sacrifices of those who served our country.\n\nWe think of the bayonet charge of Maine\u2019s 20th Regiment on Little Round Top, the young men battling through rain and poison gas in the Argonne, the soldiers in the frozen Ardennes Forest in the Battle of the Bulge.\n\nAnd we think of President Trump, battling rain for not one but two days in France this weekend.\n\nOther presidents had made sacrifices. George Washington camped with his frozen troops in Valley Forge. William Henry Harrison died after a two-hour inaugural address in the rain.\n\nBut these were as nothing compared with the elements Trump battled in Paris.\n\nOn Saturday, the White House, citing \u201clogistical difficulties caused by the weather,\u201d canceled Trump\u2019s trip to a memorial at Belleau, where 2,000 U.S. Marines died a century ago. It was raining \u2014 and Trump opted to remain at the U.S. ambassador\u2019s residence, watching TV and tweeting.\n\nThe next day, when other world leaders marched down the Champs-Elysees to the Arc de Triomphe for the centenary of the Armistice ending World War I, Trump instead took his motorcade. The reason this time: security. Once again, it was raining, and Trump stayed dry in his armored limousine.\n\nThese were brave decisions, because they meant Trump would have to endure the hurtful images of other world leaders visiting other memorials around France despite the rain, then marching in soggy solidarity without him. His excuses for skipping the war memorial earned ridicule because the cemetery was just an hour\u2019s drive (less than half the time the White House claimed) and Trump had previously boasted about ordering his pilots to fly him despite bad weather \u2014 to a campaign rally.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s behavior, not unlike Washington\u2019s winter at Valley Forge, should be seen in a patriotic light \u2014 a selfless sacrifice for the good of the country. Consider the international disgrace the United States would have suffered if his hair were to have become matted by rain without adequate measures to protect it. Or if wind gusts had whipped his mane into an orange tornado swirling above a sparse white scalp. A soaking could have been calamitous. (This explains why he sent his bald chief of staff, John F. Kelly, in his place.) Trump, therefore, absorbed the losses at Belleau Wood and on the Champs-Elysees to prevail later, at Suresnes American Cemetery, after receiving hair spray reinforcements.\n\nSuch shrewd strategic thinking has been Trump\u2019s hallmark since high school at New York Military Academy, where he received \u201cmore training militarily\u201d than many get in the actual military. Bone spurs sadly kept him from Vietnam, but he said that avoiding STDs was \u201cmy personal Vietnam\u201d and that he was \u201ca great and very brave soldier\u201d in this cause.\n\nSome say Trump doesn\u2019t know the meaning of sacrifice, particularly because he resisted lowering flags after the death of John \u201cNot a War Hero\u201d McCain. But as Trump himself told one Gold Star family, \u201cI\u2019ve made a lot of sacrifices.\u201d And the Paris voyage highlighted Trump\u2019s powers of self-abnegation, coming after he abandoned a $100-million military parade he ordered to honor himself.\n\nHe endured French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s \u201cvery insulting\u201d proposal that Europe build up its own military. He endured a topless woman disrupting his motorcade with the words \u201cfake peacemaker\u201d on her chest. He endured mockery in the French press for confusing the Balkans with the Baltics. He endured Macron\u2019s speech declaring that \u201cnationalism is a betrayal of patriotism.\u201d And he endured the obvious impression that other leaders didn\u2019t want him at their \u201cPeace Forum,\u201d which began as Trump left.\n\nThrough it all, Trump kept his powder dry \u2014 and his hair. In the end, his sacrifice was rewarded.\n\nIt was still raining Sunday afternoon when Trump went by motorcade to Suresnes. But this time Trump did not retreat. He heroically cast aside his umbrella and spoke \u2014 for 10 moist minutes.\n\nHe recalled the sacrifice of Americans in the Great War (\u201cthrough rain, hail, snow, mud, poisonous gas, bullets and mortar, they held the line\u201d). And he invoked his own sacrifice, telling a group under a tent: \u201cYou look so comfortable up there, under shelter as we\u2019re getting drenched.\u201d\n\nThe lectern dripped. His overcoat glistened. And yet his hair, under protective lacquer, held firm \u2014 like the burning bush that was not consumed.\n\nThe valiant polymers that fell defending his hair from the rain seeped into the soil at Suresnes. Now it truly can be said, as the poem goes, that there\u2019s some corner of a foreign field that is forever Trump.\n\nRead more from Dana Milbank\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.", "GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip \u2014 Hamas and other militant groups said Tuesday they had accepted an Egyptian-brokered cease-fire to end two days of intense fighting with Israel that had pushed the sworn enemies to the brink of a new war.\n\nThe sudden announcement brought relief to a region that had been paralyzed by hundreds of Palestinian rocket attacks in southern Israel and scores of Israeli airstrikes on targets in the Gaza Strip. But it did not address the deeper issues that pushed Israel and Gaza\u2019s Hamas rulers toward their latest violence and left doubts about international efforts to forge a broader truce agreement.\n\nThose efforts had appeared to be making progress in recent days as Israel allowed Qatar to deliver financial aid to the cash-strapped Hamas government, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared that he wanted to avert an \u201cunnecessary\u201d war in Gaza. Hamas, in turn, had scaled back its mass protests that have led to weekly bloodshed along the Israeli border.\n\nBut hours after Netanyahu spoke Sunday, an Israeli commando unit on an undercover mission was caught behind enemy lines in Gaza by Hamas militants. Their discovery set off a battle that led to the deaths of seven militants and an Israeli officer, and triggered the heaviest barrage of rocket fire since a 2014 war.\n\nThe Israeli military said that Palestinian militants fired 460 rockets and mortars into Israel in a 24-hour period, while it carried out airstrikes on 160 targets in Gaza. Seven Palestinians, including five militants, were killed, and 26 people were wounded. In Israel, a 48-year-old Palestinian laborer was killed in a rocket strike on an apartment building where he was staying. Nearly 30 people were wounded, three critically.\n\nWith air raid sirens wailing throughout southern Israel and the explosions of airstrikes thundering in Gaza, the sides had appeared to be headed to what would have been their fourth war in a decade.\n\nBut late Tuesday, Hamas and other military groups issued a joint statement saying they had accepted an Egyptian cease-fire.\n\nTerms of the deal appeared to be modest. Daoud Shehab, a spokesman for the Islamic Jihad militant group, said each side would promise quiet in exchange for quiet.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mutual commitment to the cease-fire,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom our side, we responded positively to the Egyptian endeavor on the condition that the occupation does the same.\u201d\n\nThe announcement set off celebrations in Gaza City as Hamas supporters declared victory.\n\nAt a demonstration staged in the rubble of Hamas\u2019 TV station, demolished by an Israeli airstrike, crowds chanted the name of Hamas\u2019 military wing. Shops reopened and cars jammed the streets. Israeli reconnaissance drones continued to buzz overhead.\n\nIsmail Radwan, a Hamas official, expressed Hamas\u2019 commitment to the cease-fire but warned that \u201cour hands are on the trigger\u201d if Israel violates the agreement.\n\nIn Israel, officials had no comment on the cease-fire claim even as dozens of protesters in the rocket-battered town of Sderot chanted \u201cDisgrace!\u201d at what they saw as the government\u2019s capitulation to militant violence. But after nightfall, both the rocket attacks and Israeli airstrikes had stopped.\n\nThe announcement came shortly after Netanyahu\u2019s Security Cabinet ended a seven-hour discussion on the rising tensions in Gaza.\n\nThe Cabinet said it had ordered the military to \u201ccontinue operations as needed.\u201d Israel\u2019s Channel 10 TV reported deep divisions among the participants, with several hard-line ministers reportedly opposed to another cease-fire with Hamas.\n\nHamas, an Islamic militant group that opposes Israel\u2019s existence, seized control of the Gaza Strip from the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority in 2007.\n\nIsrael and Egypt immediately imposed a blockade on Gaza to contain Hamas. The blockade has ravaged Gaza\u2019s economy, and Israel refuses to lift it unless Hamas disarms, a demand the militants reject.\n\nThe standoff has produced repeated rounds of violence, including indiscriminate Gaza rocket fire at Israeli towns and cities and punishing Israeli military offensives, but Hamas remains firmly in control. Netanyahu\u2019s apparent reluctance to launch a full-scale war reflected the lack of good choices at his disposal.\n\nIsrael Ziv, a retired general who once commanded the Israeli military\u2019s Gaza division, said Netanyahu was running out of options for dealing with Hamas.\n\n\u201cEither we come to a settlement or there\u2019s an all-out campaign. Nothing in the middle is going to make a difference,\u201d he said.\n\nTuesday\u2019s cease-fire did not appear to address any of the underlying issues, including the blockade and Hamas\u2019 vast arsenal of rockets, and it was unclear whether U.N. and Egyptian efforts toward a broader deal might resume.\n\nU.N. and Egyptian mediators had been making progress in recent weeks toward informal understandings between Israel and Hamas that would ease the blockade in exchange for ratcheting down the border protests.\n\nDemonstrators each week approach the border fence, throwing firebombs, grenades and burning tires at Israeli troops. Israeli snipers have killed about 170 people, most of them unarmed. Israel says it is defending its border against attackers, but it has come under heavy international criticism for shooting unarmed people.\n\nIn recent days, Israel allowed fuel shipments to increase the power supply in Gaza, which suffers from frequent blackouts, and agreed to additional Qatari assistance to allow Hamas to pay the salaries of its thousands of unpaid workers.\n\nA diplomatic official said the cease-fire included an \u201cunderstanding\u201d to return to a 2014 cease-fire that promised some relief for Gaza in exchange for quiet.\n\nThe official said he expected a return to the situation before the latest burst of violence and for mediators to resume their efforts. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter with the media.\n\nPalestinian U.N. Ambassador Riyad Mansour told reporters at U.N. headquarters that \u201cwe are grateful for the Egyptians who are mediating.\u201d\n\nThe U.N.

(Kiyoshi Ota/Getty Images)\n\nJuan Soto\u2019s rookie year was spotted by few hiccups, few missteps and few individual defeats even as the Washington Nationals sputtered in the standings and finished eight games out of the playoffs.\n\nBut Soto did take a slight loss Monday evening, finishing second to Atlanta Braves outfielder Ronald Acuna Jr. in the National League rookie of the year race, the Baseball Writers Association of America deciding that Acuna had a slightly more impressive season than did the Nationals' young star. Acuna won the award by a wide margin, earning 27 of the 30 first-place votes, while Soto received just two to finish in second place. Los Angeles Dodgers starting pitcher Walker Buehler finished third.\n\nIn the American League rookie of the year race, Japanese slugger-pitcher Shohei Ohtani of the Los Angeles Angels topped the New York Yankees' Gleyber Torres and Miguel Andujar.\n\n\u201cYou really can\u2019t go wrong with either Juan or Acuna, both will be great players in our league and our division for a long time,\u201d Nationals Manager Dave Martinez said in late September when asked about Soto and Acuna as rookie of the year candidates. \u201cOf course, I think the rookie of the year is Juan Soto. He has done things no other teenagers have. He has been incredible, but it could go either way and baseball is lucky to have both those guys.\"\n\n[A big hit: Juan Soto, the surprise of the Nationals\u2019 season, is here to stay]\n\n\n\nJuan Soto, seen on his current MLB tour of Japan, came up short for NL rookie of the year. (Kiyoshi Ota/Getty Images)\n\nSoto, who turned 20 in October, built his case on all that he accomplished at 19 years old. He bested Hall of Famer Mel Ott for most walks by a teenager since 1900. He finished with the second-most home runs by a teenager in history, tied with Bryce Harper and better than Ken Griffey Jr., Mickey Mantle and many others who became either Hall of Famers or superstars. But he was ultimately outpaced by the 20-year-old Acuna, who thrived once the Braves moved him into the leadoff spot in the middle of the season.\n\nAcuna\u2019s and Soto\u2019s numbers were near-identical, and it was long established that Buehler, despite his 2.62 ERA and shutdown second half, was on the outside of a two-horse race that ultimately tilted heavily in Acuna\u2019s favor. Acuna made his major league debut a month before Soto was called up in mid-May, but Soto ended up playing in 116 games while Acuna appeared in 111. Acuna ended up with a slim advantage in home runs (26 to 22), runs scored (78 to 77), hits (127 to 121) and batting average (.293 to .292). Soto, on the other hand, had more RBI (70 to 64), an edge in on-base-plus-slugging percentage (.932 to .917), walked considerably more (79 to Acuna\u2019s 45) and struck out less (99 to Acuna\u2019s 123). That all helped Soto compile a .406 on-base percentage to Acuna\u2019s .366, and the numbers are comparable considering that Soto had just seven more plate appearances on the season.\n\nBut Acuna was set apart, most likely by his defense, base running and role in pushing the upstart Braves into the postseason. While rookie of the year is an individual award, a close race can take team success into account. Acuna also showed more promise as a left fielder, a spot Soto was still getting accustomed to in 2018, making him a better all-around option given how similarly the two players fared at the plate.\n\nIn the AL, Ohtani won the award following a debut season that failed to live up to the massive hype surrounding the Japanese star, a rare full-time two-way player, and yet still delivered a historic performance. Ohtani received 25 of the 30 first-place votes, while Andujar finished with the other five.\n\nOhtani, 24, was billed as the Babe Ruth of Japan in his native country, and he became the first MLB player since Ruth in 1919 to amass 20 home runs and 50 innings pitched in the same season. He finished with a .285 batting average, .361 on-base percentage and .564 slugging percentage with 22 home runs in 326 at-bats and he went 4-2 with a 3.31 ERA and 63 strikeouts in 51\u2154 innings. His .925 OPS would have ranked sixth among AL hitters and his ERA eighth among starting pitchers if he had enough at-bats and/or innings to qualify.\n\nBut Ohtani\u2019s season was hampered by injuries, most notably a torn elbow ligament that limited him to just one trip to the mound over the season\u2019s final three months. He underwent Tommy John surgery in October and will be limited to being a full-time designated hitter in 2019, with a return to the mounded slated for 2020.\n\n\u201cPutting numbers aside \u2014 I don\u2019t even want to talk about numbers \u2014 I was just kind of disappointed I wasn\u2019t able to play a full season,\u201d Ohtani said through an interpreter Monday night. \u201cI feel like elite players should be able to play a full year and help out their team.\u201d\n\nAndujar, meanwhile, turned an April stint as Brandon Drury\u2019s replacement at third base into a permanent job with the Yankees. He batted to a slash line of .297/.328/.527 with 27 homers in 573 at-bats and led all MLB rookies in hits (170), doubles (47), RBI (92) and extra-base hits (76). He was seeking to become the Yankees\u2019 second straight winner of the AL award, after Aaron Judge won unanimously in 2017.\n\nAnd yet it was Ohtani\u2019s debut season, though only consisting of a limited number of at-bats and 10 starts, that earned a spot alongside Acuna as this year\u2019s best of the league\u2019s youngest stars.\n\nDave Sheinin contributed to this report.\n\nRead more Nationals coverage from The Post:\n\nFinding a starting catcher ranks high on the Nationals' list of priorities\n\nWhy the Nationals don\u2019t see upgrading at second base as an offseason priority\n\nSome laugh at $400 million for Bryce Harper.

And by the end of the season those two games of being unable to slow down the Rams could end up being the difference between Seattle finding its way into the playoffs and being left home for the second straight year.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a moral victories guy. A loss is a loss,\u201d Seattle linebacker Bobby Wagner said. \u201cWe need to grow from it. It\u2019s only good if we learn something from it and do better. We\u2019ve got to do that. We have to apply that to the rest of the season.\u201d\n\nSeattle has little time to make corrections with Green Bay visiting on Thursday night in a matchup with major wild-card implications in the NFC. Seattle has dropped two straight, falling to 4-5 and can\u2019t afford a third straight loss if it wants to remain in the playoff race.\n\nCarroll believes there is still time for Seattle to make a playoff run. But its defense must improve starting this week.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to go. We\u2019ve got to take these one week at a time and start piling up some wins. I like our style and I like our style in playoff mode. I\u2019d like that opportunity,\u201d Carroll said on Monday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of ball to play, there are a lot of games coming at us, lot of opportunities at home and we should have nothing but the thoughts that we should build on where we are right now and have a chance to get going and get better. Hopefully we can stay healthy and give us a chance to play with the same guys.\u201d\n\nFor the second straight week, Seattle was terrible at stopping the run, especially in the first half. A week earlier against the Chargers, it was Melvin Gordon running wild as that Los Angeles franchise rolled up 160 yards rushing and averaged more than 7 yards per carry.\n\nIt didn\u2019t get better against Todd Gurley and the Rams. Gurley rushed for 120 yards on just 16 carries and the Rams averaged 6.5 yards per carry. It was the third time this season Seattle has allowed its opponent to average more than 6 yards per rush \u2014 it happened just seven times in the previous eight seasons.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just got to play better and not allow the big plays to happen,\u201d Carroll said. \u201cIt\u2019s just consistency. That\u2019s the common denominator, the consistency at the line of scrimmage.\u201d\n\nThe Rams are the only team this season to score 30 or more points against the Seahawks, but what was a rarity under Carroll\u2019s regime has become more of an issue in the past two years.\n\nFrom the middle of the 2011 season through the end of the 2016 season, the Seahawks allowed 30 or more points eight times, including none in the 2012 season \u2014 a span of 89 games.\n\nIn the past two seasons, including Sunday\u2019s 36-31 loss to the Rams, the Seahawks have given up 30 or more points seven times in a span of 25 games.\n\nInjuries can be blamed for some of the problems, but clearly the Seahawks defense is far more vulnerable than they\u2019ve been in the past.\n\n\u201cWe gave up too many plays, particularly early. It took us a while to zero in on what we needed to do to stop the running game. I really thought that was the key,\u201d Carroll said. \u201cThey did a nice job again. They continue to just keep rolling on offense and we weren\u2019t able to slow them down enough.\u201d\n\nNOTES: Center Justin Britt declined to comment about a postgame confrontation with Rams\u2019 DT Aaron Donald. Donald rushed Britt near midfield at the end of the game and the players had to be separated. ... Carroll was unsure the status of LB K.J. Wright who left Sunday\u2019s game with a knee injury. Wright had knee surgery in August that caused him to miss the first six games. ... Carroll said he expects RB Chris Carson and G D.J. Fluker to be able to play against the Packers. Both players sat out Sunday\u2019s game in the hope of being able to play against Green Bay.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

And in the case of mental illness, she says, many believe it is a reflection of evil forces and is best countered by a faith healer invoking prayer.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have any doctors to prescribe psychotropic drugs.

She\u2019s now interested in seeking medical help.\n\nClimate extremes, harsh land and unsanitary conditions make the camps a breeding ground for diseases and mental stress.\n\nThat means there\u2019s plenty of work for doctors. It also means there\u2019s plenty of business for faith healers like Kalam, who says he\u2019s doing Allah\u2019s bidding and isn\u2019t bothered by people who don\u2019t believe in his powers.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t be worried by what people have to say,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cMaybe the doctor will say what does a boidu know?

He promotes it as a regional economic development project that would share the economic boom of Cancun\u2019s world class beach resorts with poorer, more remote parts of the south.\n\nAnother project on the ballot will be construction of an oil refinery in his home state of Tabasco as well as social programs such as giving scholarships to students and pensions to seniors.\n\nLopez Obrador said he would openly push for public support because they are campaign promises. He won election July 1 in a resounding victory and will take office Dec. 1.\n\nThe referendum, like the last one, will be conduction by a private nonprofit, the Rosenblueth Foundation.\n\nThousands of people marched in Mexico City on Sunday in favor of the new airport project and against the idea of public referendums.\n\nThe proposed \u201cMayan train\u201d would run from Cancun south through Tulum and to the Mayan ruins of Palenque. A spur would include the cities of Campeche, Merida and Valladolid. Lopez Obrador previously said it would cost $6 billion to $8 billion.\n\nThe region is full of jungle, wetlands, wildlife reserves and pre-Hispanic archaeological sites, but Lopez Obrador said Monday that there would be no environmental impact. He said it would be offset by a simultaneous project to plant about 250,000 acres (100,000 hectares) of fruit and timber trees in southern Mexico.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that I have polls and I\u2019m very confident that the people are going to vote to build the Mayan train, because it won\u2019t hurt anyone.

Take a look at the vote totals in the contest for California superintendent of public instruction.\n\nA week after the vote, a decision has not yet been made in the race between two Democrats, state legislator Tony Thurmond, who supports traditional public schools, and Marshall Tuck, a former charter school network president.\n\nWith more than 7 million votes cast, only a few thousand separate the two after a campaign that cost at least $50 million \u2014 all for a position that has no policymaking power.\n\nThroughout the first week of counting, Tuck held a lead, although by Monday it was only a few thousand votes. By Tuesday morning, Thurmond had pulled ahead.\n\nOn Monday morning, Tuck was ahead, barely, with 3,581,769 votes to Thurmond\u2019s 3,568,300.

(Eugene Garcia/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)\n\nVolunteer chaplains hovered outside the crime scene Saturday afternoon when the trio of friends settled beneath the caution tape and started assembling. They had white computer paper, permanent markers, black electrical tape and 12 U.S. flags \u2014 one for each victim of the mass shooting inside Borderline Bar and Grill last week.\n\nIt had been four days since the midterm elections, three days since seven of their friends were gunned down at their favorite bar and two days since catastrophic twin blazes had formed a ring of fire around this Southern California community. The second tragedy of the week had somehow dwarfed the first. Outside Borderline there was a memorial, but it was scant: a floral cross and a small group of votive candles on the street corner.\n\nNothing about it felt personal, not yet.\n\nGarrett Tingus, 21, thought to bring the flags. Hannah Largent, 21, had the craft supplies in her trunk, along with the rest of her belongings, because the fires had forced her to evacuate. And Kaitlyn Maki, 22, cried as she wrote the names of friends whom she had joyfully and innocently joined in a group picture on Wednesday night, just minutes before a gunman stormed the dance floor and killed them.\n\n[Pair survived the Las Vegas massacre. A California shooting took one away.]\n\nAll three are Borderline regulars, and all three were trying to navigate the process of grieving a deadly mass shooting at the same time their home state was burning in the north and the south. So they did what they could, taping the flags and the makeshift name placards on a short wall at the edge of the police blockade.\n\n\u201cThey would have done it for me,\u201d Tingus said.\n\nThe nation\u2019s mass shootings have begun to follow a somber and common protocol: the crime, the mayhem of the moment and the sobriety of the body count, the name of the shooter, the names of the victims, the vigils, the funerals, the questions that rarely produce answers.\n\nBut what does that process look like in the middle of a natural disaster?\n\n\u201cThis grieving process that we had tried to help with is stopped,\u201d said Kalin Woodward, 21, a senior studying political and environmental science at nearby California Lutheran University. A member of student government, Woodward and her peers started planning vigils and gatherings for those affected by the shooting almost immediately. Then the Hill and Woolsey fires rapidly spread throughout the area, and nearly everything was postponed indefinitely.\n\nWoodward visited the shooting site for the first time Saturday afternoon on her way home from dropping off supplies for victims of the wildfires. A Borderline regular, Woodward said she wasn\u2019t at the venue Wednesday night. She lives just a few blocks away, though, and her mother heard the gunshots.\n\nOutside Borderline, she got on her knees and prayed for healing as her younger brother stroked her hair. The volunteer chaplains, there with the Billy Graham organization, prayed with her, too.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not much you can say; that\u2019s the thing,\u201d Woodward said. \u201cYou\u2019re at a loss. Do you pray that it doesn\u2019t happen again? Eventually you just pray for it to hurt less.\u201d\n\nPublic vigils were downsized to private hangouts, where friends drank beers and toasted those no longer there and recalled story after story about them. Sharing the memories made it feel as though they could keep those who died alive just a bit longer.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing better in this situation than being with your Borderline family,\u201d Largent said.\n\nThe corner of South Moorpark Road and Rolling Oaks Drive has become a place for reunions. Survivors retrieved their cars, still parked where they had been when the gunfire began. Many remained without their cellphones, abandoned on the dance floor. Their bar tabs were still open, which meant they didn\u2019t have their credit cards, either.\n\nThey joked, in a macabre way, that they were still good for their bills.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, after Tingus, Largent and Maki taped up their flags and placards, Ben Ginsburg checked in as he picked up his car. Because of the fires, it had taken him several days to return. He had escaped the shooting with Maki, the two of them running to a hill, where Ginsburg called his parents and lent Maki his phone to call hers.\n\nBy the time Ginsburg returned Sunday morning, the modest memorial had transformed into a robust display. A man from Illinois who makes wooden memorials to honor the dead after mass shootings had driven through the day and night to bring 12 white wooden crosses here. They stood in front of Tingus\u2019s American flags, adorned with hearts, angel wings and names.\n\n[Horrific scene after horrific scene, a tragic mass-shooting routine has emerged]\n\nGinsburg gathered with hundreds of others, including some who survived the Borderline shooting and the massacre at a country music festival in Las Vegas last year. Beside mounds of flowers, cowboy boots and bottles of liquor with shot glasses, one woman who was crying left a bottle of beer. One man wore a shirt that said \u201c58 empty bar stools,\u201d a reference to the 58 people who died in the Las Vegas shooting, the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.\n\nThe Billy Graham chaplains watched the memorial evolve before their eyes, and they offered to pray with those who gathered. But Ginsburg, who is Jewish, gay and leans more politically liberal, said he hasn\u2019t found the same kind of comfort in such public gestures.\n\nSo many mass shootings to grieve. Ginsburg said he was still struggling to come to grips with the mass shooting that left 11 people dead inside a synagogue in Pittsburgh just days before this one.\n\nIn the wake of that shooting, he visited his rabbi and shared how frustrated he was by the calls to action framed by \u201cnext time.\u201d The shooting in Pittsburgh was the \u201c500th example of next time,\u201d he remembers saying, and his rabbi told him that it will get worse before it gets better.\n\n\u201cNone of us could have imagined that it could happen again a week later in a much more personal way,\u201d Ginsburg said. \u201cThis is not the kind of club I ever wanted to be part of.\u201d\n\nOn top of that, the threat of fire has kept him on edge, too.\n\n\u201cIt feels like I haven\u2019t been able to relax, because immediately afterwards I was thinking, \u2018What if I have to evacuate?\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cNow I\u2019m packing a bag.\u201d\n\nBy Sunday night, the fires had passed and the roads had reopened, allowing survivors like Ginsburg to finally grieve in Thousand Oaks the way thousands of others have after other mass shootings across the country.\n\nHe is unsure about what should come next.\n\n\u201cPart of the healing process for me will be some kind of action,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what form that will take. I\u2019m not normally an activist, but a lot changed in an hour for me.\u201d\n\nHe doesn\u2019t believe there should be blanket calls for gun control after all mass shootings. Every case is different, he said, and in this case, people he knows were killed.\n\n\u201cI would challenge somebody to look at me directly and say that their right to own and bear a firearm is more valuable than my life,\u201d he said.\n\nFor now, he\u2019s going to keep saying the prayer, Birkat HaGomel, that is now bookmarked on all his devices: \u201cBasically, what it says is that I\u2019m thankful to be alive.\u201d", "CHICAGO \u2014 It began in a way gun advocates have suggested would curtail violence.

Steve King, the newly reelected Iowa Republican with a history of incendiary comments about race and immigration, dared a conservative magazine to show evidence that he had called immigrants \u201cdirt.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust release the full tape,\u201d King, who eked out a victory last week despite affiliations with white nationalists, told the Weekly Standard\u2019s online managing editor Saturday on Twitter. Days earlier, the magazine reported that King had made an inflammatory joke about immigrants.\n\nThe Weekly Standard released the recording \u2014 a two-minute audio in which King can be heard bantering with a handful of supporters at the back of an Iowa restaurant during a campaign stop on Nov. 5, the magazine reported. He talked about pheasant hunting and his \u201cpatented pheasant noodle soup\u201d sprinkled with whole jalape\u00f1o peppers he had grown himself. Around the 1:20 mark, King joked that he\u2019d have to get some \u201cdirt from Mexico\u201d to grow his next batch of peppers because they didn\u2019t have enough bite.\n\n\u201cTrust me, it\u2019s already on its way,\u201d a woman quipped, appearing to refer to the caravan of Central American migrants traveling from Mexico to the U.S. border.\n\nKing engaged, saying: \u201cWell, yeah, there\u2019s plenty of dirt. It\u2019s coming from the West Coast, too. And a lot of other places, besides. This is the most dirt we\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\n\nThe following day, on Election Day, Weekly Standard assistant opinion editor Adam Rubenstein, who was covering the campaign event and has been critical of King, published an article about the conversation. It included a transcript but not the audio.\n\nIn a statement to The Washington Post on Monday evening, Sarah Stevens, King\u2019s chief of staff, accused the Weekly Standard of misrepresenting the congressman\u2019s comments and conjuring a false story. Stevens said the congressman believed the supporter was referring to dirt coming from the \u201cleftist media,\u201d not immigrants. In response to the supporter, King repeated similar comments he had been making during the campaign \u2014 that the \u201cleftist media\u201d and liberal multibillionaires from coastal states were trying to smear him, Stevens said.\n\nThe magazine stood by its story, saying it quoted King at length to provide readers with context. Claiming King was referring to the media is \u201cabsurd\u201d given the context of the conversation, during which the media was never mentioned, according to an editor\u2019s note at the end of Rubenstein\u2019s story.\n\n[Following the Pittsburgh attack, Rep. Steve King\u2019s Iowa supporters brush aside concern about his white nationalist views]\n\nDays after Rubenstein\u2019s story was published, King and the Weekly Standard engaged in a public Twitter fight over what he actually meant.\n\nThe Weekly Standard has joined the HuffPost \u201cat the bottom of the lying journalistic gutter,\u201d the congressman tweeted in the wee morning hours Friday.\n\nTo which Stephen Hayes, the magazine\u2019s editor in chief, replied: \u201cThe Weekly Standard remains, proudly, a reporting-driven conservative journal of opinion. \u2026 There are no lies, willful or otherwise. \u2026 Our reporter wouldn\u2019t focus on your bigotry if you weren\u2019t a bigot.\u201d\n\nKing replied later by castigating Hayes for defending his reporter. He suggested that the magazine refused to publish the audio because it doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nHours later, on Saturday, the Weekly Standard did release it, along with a column from Hayes.\n\n\u201cSo, King claimed our reporter lied. He didn\u2019t. He claimed we didn\u2019t have a recording. We did. He insisted we refused to release the audio. Untrue,\u201d Hayes wrote.\n\nThe congressman, who shares President Trump\u2019s hard-line immigration policies, has a long history of inflammatory rhetoric against immigrants, minorities and the media and has peddled conspiratorial views about \u201cwhite genocide.\u201d\n\n[Rep. King met with far-right Austrians on trip funded by Holocaust memorial group]\n\nHe has compared immigrants to dogs. He said immigrants have \u201ccalves the size of cantaloupes\u201d because they haul drugs across the desert. He tweeted a cartoon depicting President Barack Obama wearing a turban. He retweeted a self-described Nazi sympathizer. He endorsed a white nationalist mayoral candidate who questioned whether immigration is causing \u201cwhite genocide.\u201d He said he hoped Supreme Court Justices Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor \u201cwill elope to Cuba.\u201d He reportedly attacked the National Republican Congressional Committee for backing a gay candidate.\n\nHe met with members of the far-right Austrian Freedom Party, which has historical Nazi ties, during a trip financed by a Holocaust memorial group. In the aftermath of the mass shooting inside a synagogue in Pittsburgh, King defended associating with the Austrian party and said: \u201cIf they were in America pushing the platform that they push, they would be Republicans.\u201d\n\nOn election night, King barred the Des Moines Register, Iowa\u2019s largest newspaper, from covering his event, calling the paper a \u201cleftist propaganda media outlet.\u201d\n\nKing has been in Congress since 2003, representing Iowa\u2019s northwest quadrant. Once on the fringe, King has moved further into the mainstream after Trump\u2019s election.\n\nRepublicans on Capitol Hill have largely stayed silent about King. But in late October, Rep. Steve Stivers (R-Ohio), the National Republican Congressional Committee chairman, criticized King for espousing extreme views online.\n\n\u201cCongressman Steve King\u2019s recent comments, actions, and retweets are completely inappropriate. We must stand up against white supremacy and hate in all forms, and I strongly condemn this behavior,\u201d Stivers tweeted.\n\nFelicia Sonmez, Isaac Stanley-Becker and Julie Zauzmer contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:\n\nRep.
