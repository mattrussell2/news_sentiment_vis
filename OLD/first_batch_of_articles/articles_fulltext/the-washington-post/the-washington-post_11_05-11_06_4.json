["Democrats had a good shot at winning the House majority Tuesday night and a considerably less good shot at winning control of the Senate. And neither outcome will wind up being surprising.\n\nDemocrats are well on their way to a clear win in the House, with the only question being how big their majority will be. Meanwhile, a tough map in the Senate wound up being too much to overcome, with Republicans set to gain seats there.\n\n(We\u2019ll regularly update this post with the results and scenarios that suggest where things stand.)\n\nThe House: Majority, achieved\n\nThe majority math in the House ran through approximately 30 races regarded as \u201ctoss-ups\u201d by the Cook Political Report \u2014 almost all of them seats held by Republicans. As long as everything else broke the way we expected, Democrats needed to win just seven of these 30 races to gain the 23 seats they needed. Pretty doable.\n\nThen the math became easier pretty rapidly Tuesday night \u2014 doubly so after Democrats pulled some upsets in races they weren\u2019t supposed to win (the clearest sign of a \u201cwave\u201d election) in New York\u2019s 11th District and Oklahoma\u2019s 5th. That meant they needed just 5 of the 30 toss-ups.\n\nAnd they\u2019ve now got that, too. Even if Republicans somehow won the remainder of the toss-ups, Democrats would have a House majority. If Democrats start winning more, we could be talking about a 40-seat gain. If the rest of the toss-ups just split as the first 12 have, that would be a 36-seat gain \u2014 and a 231-204 majority.\n\nHere\u2019s how the toss-ups have broken down thus far:\n\nSeats Democratic wins Republican wins Undecided 1 FL-26 KY-6 CA-10 2 VA-2 NC-13 CA-25 3 IL-14 OH-12 CA-39 4 TX-32 PA-10 CA-45 5 NJ-7 FL-15 CA-48 6 IA-3 GA-6 7 VA-7 KS-2 8 ME-2 9 MN-1 10 MI-8 11 NC-9 12 NJ-3 13 NM-2 14 NY-19 15 NY-22 16 PA-1 17 TX-7 18 UT-4\n\nIf we broaden it out to include districts that are considered likely to flip and ones that \u201clean\u201d toward one party or another, we get a universe of 75 vulnerable Republican seats and just six vulnerable Democratic ones. Democrats needed to win 29 of those 81 total seats to win the majority.\n\nHere\u2019s how that looks. Just remember you needed to see 29 total blue dots in the \u201cVulnerable D\u201d and \u201cVulnerable R\u201d categories combined. As long as three-eighths of them are blue as the night goes on, Democrats are on-pace.\n\nMany more Republican-held seats are considered vulnerable this year. See live U.S. House results\n\nThe Senate: GOP gains dash Democratic dreams\n\nA quartet of losses to start the night in Indiana, Tennessee, Texas and North Dakota quickly foreclosed any hopes of Democrats winning the Senate. Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s (R-Tex.) win over Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (D) effectively sealed the deal \u2014 in painful fashion for Democrats with such high hopes in Texas.\n\nSen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) also fell to Republican Josh Hawley in Missouri, leaving the only question how much the GOP\u2019s majority will grow. Democrats also trail with almost all of the vote in Florida.\n\nHere\u2019s a good scenario for Republicans, which would also include a win in Nevada \u2014 a three-seat gain. And that\u2019s not the ceiling.", "\n\nBradley Beal and the Wizards lost, 119-100, Tuesday night against Dallas. (Brandon Wade/AP)\n\nDALLAS \u2014 Bradley Beal doesn\u2019t necessarily need a statistic to tell him what he has already seen on the court. He can feel it during games: The Washington Wizards could be playing a lot faster.\n\n\u201cThroughout the course of the game, sometimes we\u2019re not running hard enough or we\u2019re not getting into our sets fast enough,\u201d Beal said before Tuesday\u2019s 119-100 loss to the Dallas Mavericks. \u201cSometimes we\u2019re getting into our sets too late in the clock. A lot of times, Coach [Scott Brooks] doesn\u2019t even want us running sets. That\u2019s how fast he wants us playing.\u201d\n\nDuring their loss in Dallas, the Wizards had to force the action after falling into a big deficit. Doomed by unacceptable three-point defense (Dallas made 13 of 23 attempts from beyond the arc in the first half), Washington trailed by 24 points before halftime. The Wizards gave chase in the third quarter, hitting several jumpers early in the shot clock while outscoring the Mavericks 29-17 in the period. But after trimming the lead to 97-91 in the final quarter, Mavericks guard Dennis Smith Jr.'s individual effort on three consecutive plays effectively ended the rally.\n\nSmith, who finished with 19 points, outhustled Dwight Howard for an offensive rebound before setting up DeAndre Jordan for the dunk. Then Smith tossed a lob to Jordan, who directed the ball into the rim with his back to the basket. When Smith came up with a steal, spinning away from Beal in the open court, and assisted Harrison Barnes on his layup, Dallas (3-7) pulled ahead to a 12-point lead and never looked back. John Wall scored a team-high 24 points, and though Beal and Otto Porter Jr. each had 19 points, the Wizards fell to 2-8 on the season.\n\nBefore the start of the season, the Wizards emphasized playing fast as a hallmark of the team identity. With one of the most dynamic point guards in the league, as well as an abundance of athletic and interchangeable wings and a big man who can run, Washington has the capability to play fast within the sets. Though the team plays at a high pace (104.95 possessions per 48 minutes entering Tuesday, which was eighth in the league), the statistic doesn\u2019t necessarily show if players are running to spots, screening with force and being decisive.\n\nIn tracking data collected by John Schuhmann, a senior writer at NBA.com who focuses on advanced statistics, the Wizards averaged 11.2 miles traveled per 24 minutes of possession, which is just 24th in the NBA. The statistic specifically tracks player movement within a set and reveals limited activity within the Wizards offense. Schuhmann has noticed spots of lethargy within the team\u2019s sets.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s where they lack,\u201d said Schuhmann, who has watched several Wizards' games, both with and without Howard in the starting lineup. \u201cThere\u2019s not decisiveness and activity offensively.\u201d\n\nThe Wizards run when they can. They utilize transition often and have shown a knack for generating steals (10th in the NBA). But they\u2019re not necessarily scoring enough on the break, where they ranked 20th, averaging 1.08 points per possession in transition.\n\nCould the team\u2019s early struggles on defense be to blame?\n\n\u201cWe can always play faster, but it starts on the defensive end,\u201d Porter said. \u201cWe can\u2019t get out and run unless we get stops.\u201d\n\nEntering Tuesday\u2019s game, Washington ranked 26th in points allowed per 100 possessions, per Synergy Sports. Instead of getting a rebound and pushing the ball, the Wizards are stuck inbounding the ball after an opponent scores.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t been doing a great job rebounding the ball,\u201d Wall said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve been taking the ball out of the net a lot of times instead of just getting rebounds and pushing the pace.\u201d\n\nThe Wizards could still accelerate the offense even after an opponent\u2019s made shot, but the team\u2019s move to spread around ballhandling duties has caused a bit of confusion that\u2019s slowing things down.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t know who was taking the ball out,\u201d Wall said. In practice, \u201cwe try to simulate to have our [power forward] take out the ball every time and have the [center] run the floor, get the ball to me and let our [wing players] run the lane. So we can simplify that a little better.\u201d\n\nWhen Beal is sensing the need to pick up the pace, he has gone rogue by performing the role as the inbounder, even though Brooks wants his guards out and running.\n\n\u201cBecause I want to get it out and go fast,\u201d Beal said. \u201cA lot of times Coach hates it when guards take it out. It\u2019s usually a big\u2019s job to take it out and guards just get out so we can push the ball ahead.\n\n\u201cI notice it. I catch myself sometimes not running hard,\u201d Beal continued. \u201cThat\u2019s why I try push myself or have guys on the sideline or coaches pull me to the side, if I\u2019m not running hard enough, tell me and I can correct it and make sure I\u2019m running hard enough.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s something we definitely need to do more of.

The actor locked eyes with mine. I was helpless, in the sense that everyone else in the theater was looking at me. My only options were to resist \u2014 and thereby make a spectacle of myself \u2014 or respond to his beckoning face and participate. \u00b6 Against my instincts, I took his hand. \u00b6 With that, I was no longer watching a production. I was in one.\n\nThe show was \u201cThe Fever,\u201d which ends its run Sunday at Woolly Mammoth Theatre. You can say that no work for the theater is possible without an audience, but \u201cThe Fever\u201d takes that notion to an extreme. It essentially is the audience: a 70-minute series of exercises, in which 60 or so ticket holders, sitting in a large rectangle on the stage, are invited to engage with five practiced facilitators in what becomes a communal act of gestural imitation: the theatrical equivalent of tai chi.\n\nIt\u2019s a gentle evening, not otherwise especially memorable, really. The coercion remains of a rather mild sort. But it had me wondering about a trend gathering ever more momentum in the theater. That is, whether a performance piece of this variety is satisfying a special yearning in people these days \u2014 to be noticed \u2014 or is merely an example of how theater, in its eternal quest to embrace novelty, has found a useful means to widen its creative options.\n\nLet me just say that although I don\u2019t mind watching other theatergoers getting into the act \u2014 as a longtime observer of how audiences behave, the psychology of these events intrigues me \u2014 I hate being compelled to be the show. I\u2019m not shy or anti-social. I simply don\u2019t want to be made to feel that I must cross the line, onto the actors\u2019 playing field, or be a spoilsport if I don\u2019t. It might be that the role I have been playing for more than two decades \u2014 a paid analyst of what happens inside a theater \u2014 has conditioned me to occupy a perch slightly apart from most others who attend a play. On the other hand, it might arise from a baseline conviction that I don\u2019t want to be in your play!\n\n\n\nThe audience participates in \u201cThe Fever.\u201d (Maria Baranova)\n\nWith \u201cinteractive\u201d playgoing a growth industry, I have to assume that turning spectators into performers \u2014 usually of an improvisational sort \u2014 is meeting some desire people have to collaborate in ways that go beyond lending appreciative laughter, or tears, or applause. Not to say that all participatory theater requires quite the same degree of surrender to the production. For years, the Washington troupe dogandponydc has been on a search for the best ways to include the audience in its shows. Its most successful venture, and one I liked most, was \u201cBeertown.\u201d Conceived in 2011, \u201cBeertown\u201d took as its milieu a town meeting in a fictional, hard-pressed Midwestern community, where a vote is occurring on the items that will be placed in or removed from the Beertown time capsule, exhumed every five years for this tradition.\n\nAudience members were asked to participate in the debate and the voting but were not put on the spot to do so. This crucial distinction is a defining difference for me, and I suspect for a lot of other theatergoers, too, some of whom don\u2019t even want to go that far. I\u2019ve endured too many other nights over the years, though, when I\u2019ve stood or sat in dread of actors needing a reactive customer to complete their assignments. One such show: the highly irritating \u201cTony \u2018n Tina\u2019s Wedding,\u201d during which you mingled as a guest among the raucous and histrionic celebrants at a disastrous wedding (but did get to eat pasta and cake for your troubles).\n\n\n\nTommer Peterson in \u201cThe Fever.\u201d (Maria Baranova)\n\nI always find it extremely weird, and not particularly entertaining, to talk to actors when they\u2019re in character; the exchanges tend to be stilted and unrevealing. I often feel as though it has suddenly become my job to help them build their performances, when my falling in love with theater had to do with an opposite inclination: I wanted to be immersed in illusions I had no part in devising.\n\nThe myriad permutations of interactive theater require me to make other exceptions. \u201cSleep No More,\u201d the long-running, dreamlike performance piece that requires you to travel from room to room of a house, viewing deconstructed, lyrically allusive scenes from \u201cMacbeth,\u201d is unconventional but more like a self-guided tour than one forcing you to play a part. And the stunning New York company Third Rail Projects, which in \u201cGhost Light\u201d escorted playgoers on a spectrally beautiful trek through all the nooks and crannies of a theater, requires only the exertions that involve following actors up steep staircases and tight corners in the wings.\n\nWashington theatergoers will get a taste of Third Rail\u2019s work in March, when its world premiere production \u201cConfection\u201d \u2014 commissioned by Folger Theatre \u2014 is unveiled in Folger Shakespeare Library\u2019s Paster and Bond Reading Rooms. \u201cConfection,\u201d inspired by the subject of \u201cNell Gwynn,\u201d a new play by Jessica Swale about a Restoration-era actress that will play at Folger during part of Third Rail\u2019s run, is a \u201cmultisensory dance and theater performance that contemplates cultures of consumption,\u201d according to Folger. As part of the event, sweets will be served.\n\nAllow me to say that I\u2019m all for the interactivity of dessert. It\u2019s the more aggressive appeal for participation in a piece like \u201cThe Fever\u201d that gives me pause. I\u2019m not sure the risk-taking that keeps theater a vibrant art form should extend to feeding my anxiety that I\u2019m going to be called on for help.", "Opinion writer\n\n* Elise Viebeck and Scott Clement report that what voters have on their minds suggests a win for Democrats:\n\nVoters who will decide control of the U.S. House said President Trump and health care were two of the most important factors as they chose their candidates in the midterm election, according to preliminary results from a Washington Post-Schar School survey of battleground districts. More than four in 10 who cast early or absentee ballots or voted early Tuesday mentioned Trump or health care as the most important or second-most important factor for their vote, the preliminary results showed. The economy and immigration were close behind, receiving mention from over 3 in 10 voters in the results. Roughly 8 in 10 voters rated the economy positively, after months of job and wage growth, but even so, a small majority said they thought the country was headed in the wrong direction.\n\nIt\u2019s almost as if they\u2019re not tired of winning.\n\n* Amy Gardner and Beth Reinhard report that things are not going smoothly as Americans try to vote:\n\nCivil rights groups and election officials fielded thousands of reports of voting irregularities as voting began across the country Tuesday, with voters and advocates complaining of broken machines, rejected ballots and untrained poll workers improperly challenging Americans\u2019 right to vote.

(Kyle Grillot/Reuters)\n\nEconomic growth is at a three-year high, and unemployment is at a 49-year low, so President Trump, of course, is focusing his midterm message on the supposedly apocalyptic dangers emanating from a caravan of migrants 700 miles away.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that Trump never touts his economic record. He does. It\u2019s just that it\u2019s not as often as we might have expected, considering how well things are going right now.\n\nAlthough maybe it shouldn\u2019t be too surprising. The economy, after all, was adding a very healthy 171,000 jobs a month in 2006 before Republicans lost 31 House and six Senate seats. And it added an even more robust 245,000 jobs a month in 2014 before Democrats dropped 13 House and nine Senate seats.\n\n[Election Day: Trump, health care key issues in race for the House]\n\nWhen it comes to the midterms, then, it sure seems like it\u2019s not the economy, stupid. But, as we\u2019ll get to in a minute, it also is, partly, the economy. Midterm elections tend to first and foremost be a referendum on the president, with the economy certainly playing a part but not in the way, or maybe as much, as one might think.\n\nThe simple story is that voters don\u2019t really care about GDP growth or the unemployment rate in and of themselves, but rather what those numbers mean for themselves. While there\u2019s no real relationship between how high unemployment is and how the president\u2019s party does in the midterms, there is some relationship between how people\u2019s pocketbooks are doing and the election results.\n\n[What voters in key districts are saying on Election Day]\n\nUniversity of Denver political scientist Seth Masket has found that, specifically, what seems to matter is how much people\u2019s incomes have grown (after taxes and inflation) from the third quarter of the year before the election to the second quarter of the year of the election. It explains about 20 percent of the midterm results, according to Masket. If you add in the president\u2019s approval rating, you can explain about 57 percent of those results\n\nMaybe the best way to think about this is that the economy helps determine how favorable the political ground is for the president in the midterms, but the election battle itself is usually over what the president has done.\n\nThat leaves Trump with two problems. The first is that for all the good economic news, wage growth has still been pretty mediocre. So the economy might not be quite the winning issue that it seemed.\n\nThe second is that while Trump ran as a populist \u2014 he promised to put a lot of money into infrastructure, perhaps raise taxes on the rich and provide health insurance \u201cfor everybody\u201d \u2014 he\u2019s governed as a plutocrat instead.

(Clara Balzary)\n\nIn 2005, sisters Kate and Laura Mulleavy traveled from California to New York City for the first time, their suitcases stuffed with eight handmade dresses and two coats. The self-taught designers then cold-called fashion editors from a friend\u2019s East Village apartment and, astonishingly, landed an interview with Women\u2019s Wear Daily, a prominent fashion industry trade publication. Two days later, the journal ran a cover story on the sisters\u2019 bracingly original vision and their newly minted fashion label, Rodarte (an alternate spelling of their mother\u2019s maiden name).\n\nThe Mulleavys have since become go-to designers for stylish stars such as Cate Blanchett, Natalie Portman and Selena Gomez.

There\u2019s the beauty, but there\u2019s an undercurrent of brutality, and that\u2019s what we wanted to do with the costume [for the 2010 film]. There\u2019s the idea of scarred tissue with the hand-embroidered leather on the upper-chest area, and the netting is battered in places. All of it makes you feel like the character is wild. Making something to go with our dear friend Natalie [Portman\u2019s] performance was really special \u2014 seeing her go through that transformation really changed my view of acting.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe grew up in a little hillside town attached to Santa Cruz \u2014 sort of a surfer, skater community \u2014 and the 2013 collection this dress is from is sort of an origin story. It\u2019s based on a lot of ideas we had growing up [in the 1990s] \u2014 when we saw tie-dye for the first time, when we first encountered counterculture. This dress has beautiful roses with hand-embroidered Swarovski crystals and then it goes to tie-dye, which was maybe an homage to the Grateful Dead.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is from our mermaid collection, from 2015. When we were children, we went to the Monterey Bay Aquarium, and there was a section where they showed you what it looked like where the pier goes into the ocean and accumulates barnacles and sea anemones. So our idea of a mermaid is all about the accumulation of life on a body. There are a lot of different layers in this dress \u2014 one is an iridescent sequined net, and there\u2019s a hand-embroidered lace that has pearl and feathers. We then worked with a painter and had that hand-painted to look like things underneath the ocean.\u201d\n\n\n\n(\u00a9Dan & Corina Lecca)\n\n\u201cThis is from our [2009] collection which referenced \u2018Star Wars.\u2019 We\u2019ve always loved \u2018Star Wars\u2019 and appreciated the artistry of George Lucas; everything was so artfully done and every detail of the film \u2014 the costumes, the backgrounds \u2014 were handmade. This dress has a large, hand-embroidered swirl in the center, with Swarovski crystals, and the dress itself is probably made of 45 yards of silk tulle that has been hand-dyed and then all hand-sewn onto the dress so it looks like a second skin. The tulle was hand-dyed to create those soft washes of color that represent the nebulae of outer space.\u201d\n\n\u201cKate and I love nature. Our father is a botanist and the natural world has always been a huge part of our lives. There\u2019s no specific inspiration for this [2018] pantsuit except for the fact that I wanted to create something very beautiful and detailed, like nature. And I think one of the ways that we approach design is thinking about what makes something look so perfect that\u2019s imperfect, or how can something have so much symmetry but at the same time have an organic element to it.

(Al Drago/Bloomberg)\n\nMedia critic\n\nPresident Trump hammered Democrats on Tuesday for an alleged act of misinformation:\n\nThere is a rumor, put out by the Democrats, that Josh Hawley of Missouri left the Arena last night early. It is Fake News. He met me at the plane when I arrived, spoke at the great Rally, & stayed to the very end. In fact, I said goodbye to him and left before he did. Deception! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 6, 2018\n\nAlthough it\u2019s possible that some Democrats said something to that effect, the Erik Wemple Blog heard a Fox News correspondent state that very contention during a Fox News segment kicking off the 11 p.m. hour Monday. Kristin Fisher, who was covering Trump\u2019s rally in Cape Girardeau, Mo., said this, among other things: \u201cPresident Trump is really laying it all on the line here.\u201d Fisher talked about how much work Trump had plowed into the midterm elections. Speaking of the Senate race between Democratic incumbent Claire McCaskill and Republican challenger Josh Hawley, Fisher said, \u201cIt\u2019s one of the closest races in the entire country.\u201d She later commented, \u201cNormally at a rally like this, you would expect the candidate that the president is stumping for to get up onstage with him, but President Trump said a few moments ago that the candidate had already left. Not quite sure why, but this rally is running a little late.\u201d\n\nAt 1:30 p.m. Tuesday, Fisher went on Fox News to say, \u201cI just want to correct something that I said last night at this rally with President Trump and the Republican Senate candidate in this race, Josh Hawley. You know, about an hour into the president\u2019s remarks last night, we still hadn\u2019t heard from or seen Josh Hawley, and it was really loud in this rally, and I thought that I heard the president say that Josh Hawley was \u2018leaving.\u2019 But what he really said was Josh Hawley was \u2018leading,\u2019 as in \u2018leading in the polls,\u2019 so I just wanted to apologize for my mistake and set the record straight, especially since, to complicate matters even further now, President Trump is now tweeting, quote \u2026 \u201d\n\nAt that point, Fisher read the Trump quote about Democrats and the spreading of rumors about Hawley.\n\nSo credit Fisher and Fox News for a full-throated correction. Though Fisher could have been more careful with her reporting \u2014 perhaps by reviewing the audio, checking tweets or some other approach \u2014 her mistake was an understandable one. There but for the grace of God goes the Erik Wemple Blog.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether it was Fisher\u2019s reporting \u2014 or those mysterious rumormongering \u201cDemocrats\u201d \u2014 that gave rise to this notion. But this much is clear: It\u2019s chuckle-worthy if the president is blaming \u201cDemocrats\u201d for \u201cfake news\u201d that originated at Fox News.\n\nThat would be a misnomer as well. If it was Fisher\u2019s report that launched the whispers that Hawley had bolted, well, that wouldn\u2019t meet the original definition of \u201cfake news\u201d in any case \u2014 that is, a fabricated report designed to prey on partisan loyalties and deliver pageviews.

Last year, nearly 64,000 people were killed in Brazil, a record for the country that has long been the world leader in annual homicides.\n\nMoro told reporters that he would use some of the same tools employed in Car Wash to fight organized crime, such as using task forces to investigate crimes, saying that New York had success with the practice in its fight against the mafia.\n\nIn contrast to Bolsonaro, whose rhetoric on crime often focuses on the use of police force, Moro spoke about improving data collection, using technology and imprisoning and isolating gang leaders to combat organized crime.\n\n\u201cA good police operation is when no one gets hurt, and the criminal goes to jail, and the police officer goes home,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also pledged to implement measures to help fight corruption and said that if wrongdoing were found in Bolsonaro\u2019s administration, the justice system would pursue it.\n\nCritics worry that Bolsonaro\u2019s praise of the military dictatorship and torture, his often violent rhetoric on crime and his repeated disparaging remarks about women, black people and gays presage policies that will roll back civil rights. The president-elect himself obliquely referenced those fears on Tuesday at a ceremony to celebrate the 30th anniversary of Brazil\u2019s constitution, saying the document is the \u201ctrue north\u201d of democracy.\n\nMoro, too, addressed those concerns, saying that everything he would do would be based in the law and rights.\n\n\u201cThere is no possibility that there will be a policy of discrimination against minorities,\u201d he said.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

In this immersive, often deliciously sensuous documentary portrait of the late opera star Maria Callas, viewers are treated to another rise-and-fall story of a great but tortured artist, this one punctuated by the occasional real-life bed of roses and pleasure cruise.\n\nFor those too young to know who Maria Callas was, a trip to YouTube or Wikipedia will bring you up to speed: Long before Luciano Pavarotti and Pl\u00e1cido Domingo, she was that rare opera singer who was also a household name, as famous for her striking beauty and effortless glamour as for her tonal range and lyrical interpretive skills. To observe the New York-born Callas arriving in Rome or Milan or Paris or New York, in a cloud of furs, flowers, poodles and pearls, is to understand the fundamentals of diva style, imitated but never equaled by such successors as Madonna, Rihanna and, most recently, Lady Gaga.\n\nCallas\u2019s command of her own persona is on regal, extravagant display in Tom Volf\u2019s film, in which the director uses the subject\u2019s own words \u2014 from letters, diary entries, television interviews and her own memoirs \u2014 to narrate a succession of ravishing, rarely seen images, including some of her most famous (and notorious) performances, and candid footage of costume fittings and home movies.\n\nWhat emerges is a portrait of a woman of extraordinary natural gifts and work ethic, who was pressured to become a superstar by her mother and then her husband, instead of a conventional homemaker and mother. \u201cDestiny is destiny,\u201d she says resignedly at one point. \u201cThere\u2019s no way out.\u201d When she falls ill and cancels performances, or is fired from the Metropolitan Opera because of conflicts with its director, the viewer wonders if it\u2019s not her way of retreating from a profession she never truly chose in the first place.\n\nCallas finally finds true love \u2014 if not the conventional domestic bliss she craved \u2014 when she meets Aristotle Onassis, with whom she carried on a legendary love affair until he met Jacqueline Kennedy. That triangle forms some of the most compelling material in \u201cMaria by Callas,\u201d which is at its best when it simply watches her sing and, in her words, attempt \u201cto reach those heavens where it\u2019s all perfect harmony.\u201d", "Civil rights groups and election officials fielded thousands of reports of voting irregularities across the country Tuesday, with voters complaining of broken machines, long lines and untrained poll workers improperly challenging Americans\u2019 right to vote.\n\nThe loudest of those complaints came from Georgia, where issues of race, ballot access and election fairness have fueled an acrimonious governor\u2019s contest between Democrat Stacey Abrams and Republican Brian Kemp. Abrams, a former state lawmaker, would be the nation\u2019s first black female governor, while Kemp, the secretary of state, who oversees elections, has faced accusations of trying to suppress the minority vote.\n\nIn one downtown Atlanta precinct, voters waited three hours to cast ballots after local election officials initially sent only three voting machines to serve more than 3,000 registered voters. In suburban Gwinnett County, the wait surpassed four hours as election officials opened the polls only to discover that their voting machines were not working at all, voters said.\n\nBoth locations serve predominantly African American voters, feeding worries among some voters that specific groups were being disenfranchised amid signs of record turnout for a midterm election.\n\n\u201cLook at the people here,\u201d said Gabe Okoye, chairman of the Gwinnett County Democratic Party, as he watched mostly black voters enter and leave the voting location. \u201cSee the demography of these voters.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to play tricks anywhere, you\u2019re going to do it here,\u201d he added, noting the importance of the populous county to the final vote count.\n\nThe wave of complaints from voters came at the end of a campaign season dominated by concerns about ballot access and voting rights. It remained unclear Tuesday how many of the complaints were legitimate, how many voters were affected and whether the problems would affect the outcome of any races.\n\nSome of the anxiety stemmed from a spate of restrictive voting laws passed by Republicans in recent years affecting dozens of this year\u2019s closely contested races for the U.S. House and Senate, and governorships.\n\nRepublicans have said the tough new rules are necessary to combat voter fraud. On Monday, President Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions warned against voter fraud, although studies have found no evidence of widespread fraud.\n\nVoting rights activists argue that the laws disproportionately affect young Americans and minorities, who tend to vote Democratic. They accused Trump of trying to intimidate voters of color.\n\nThe surge in reports of voting problems also coincided with heightened enthusiasm across the country about participating in this year\u2019s races, with early voting tallies in dozens of states far outpacing those of 2014.\n\n1 of 98 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 The scene as midterm votes were cast across the country View Photos Democrats and Republicans vied for control of the House and Senate.

In Atlanta, some precincts were being kept open as late as 10 p.m. Some states, including North Dakota, were also contending with low supplies of ballots, and voters were still in line Tuesday evening.\n\nIn Prince George\u2019s County, Md., two precincts ran out of paper ballots, leaving hundreds of voters in line long after the 8 p.m. poll closing time. While they were permitted to stay in line and cast ballots, the Associated Press called the governor\u2019s race for Republican Larry Hogan at 9:07 p.m., before voting in Prince George\u2019s was complete. Supporters of Democratic gubernatorial candidate Ben Jealous were outraged, and the former NAACP chief tweeted: \u201cStay in line. Keep voting.\u201d\n\nNationally, a coalition of civil rights groups reported receiving more than 29,000 complaints of voting irregularities as of 8 p.m. \u2014 a higher call volume than in any recent midterm voting \u2014 and referred many of them to state and local election officials, the groups said in a news conference in Washington.\n\nTogether, the organizations deployed about 6,500 lawyers and monitors in 30 states to protect ballot access \u2014 more than in any previous election.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to make sure that every eligible American that seeks to have their voice heard is able to do so this election cycle,\u201d said Kristen Clarke, executive director of the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, one of the groups that joined forces to monitor elections and run a voter hotline this year. The coalition includes the NAACP, Common Cause and Asian Americans Advancing Justice.\n\nReports of nonfunctioning machines surfaced in numerous states, including New York, California and Arizona. Complaints also emerged about voting machines flipping voters\u2019 choices in Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Texas and Illinois.\n\nAlso in Arizona, a judge declined to keep some polling places open in Maricopa County that had opened late. Clarke said voters were \u201cdisenfranchised\u201d in Arizona as a result.\n\nIn New York, Corey Johnson, the speaker of the New York City Council, said voting precincts were hampered by broken scanners in all five boroughs. Voters with ballots stood in lines in rain \u2014 soaking the ballots and further complicating the process of using electronic scanners.\n\nVoting rights advocates said some of the problems stemmed from equipment that has not been replaced in more than a decade. The machines date to shortly after the presidential recount in Florida in 2000, when Congress sent billions of dollars to the states to replace outdated equipment. Another round of replacement is overdue, advocates said.\n\nAcross the country, reports about huge turnout were punctuated with complaints about voters\u2019 facing obstacles in casting their ballots.\n\nVoters with limited English proficiency in the Houston area said they were being blocked from taking interpreters in with them to help them vote, as is provided for under the Voting Rights Act, according to civil rights groups.\n\nHector De Leon, a spokesman for Harris County, which includes Houston, said he was not aware of complaints from non-English speakers about not being able to have interpreters with them.\n\nIn North Dakota, a voting rights lawyer said dozens of Native American voters were being turned away because of issues with their identification. Poll workers were rejecting identification issued by tribal officials, advising voters not to initial ballots, even though the law requires it, and discouraging voters from casting provisional ballots when they arrived without proper identification, according to Carla Fredericks, director of the Indian Law Clinic at the University of Colorado at Boulder.\n\n\u201cAfter I caught a voter who was being denied his right to vote and told him to go back in and request a set-aside ballot, the election worker told me I was interfering and need to leave,\u201d said Fredericks, a member of the Mandan, Hidatsa Arikara Nation, located in central North Dakota.\n\nIn Porter County, Ind., where Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly was trying to fend off a strong challenge from Republican Mike Braun, a judge ordered 12 polling places to stay open late after the local Democratic Party complained about openings up to three hours behind schedule.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a matter a fairness to the voter, without respect to partisan politics,\u201d said Monica Conrad, an attorney for the Porter County Democratic Party. Local Republicans unsuccessfully challenged the order by Superior Court Judge Roger Bradford, arguing that the Democrats had not provided enough evidence that polls opened late, said attorney Chris Buckley.\n\nAccusations of intimidation surfaced after U.S. Customs and Border Protection announced plans to run a \u201ccrowd-control\u201d exercise Tuesday near a Hispanic neighborhood in El Paso \u2014 the hometown of Democratic Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, who is challenging Republican Sen. Ted Cruz in a closely contested race in Texas.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, the agency abruptly canceled the exercise after critics raised concerns about voter suppression.\n\nThe center of voting anxiety was Georgia, where the bitter gubernatorial contest has played out as an emotional battle over voting rights.\n\nOne voting rights group, Protect Democracy, filed suit late Tuesday demanding that Kemp be pulled from his duties overseeing Georgia\u2019s elections.\n\n[In Georgia, governor\u2019s race evokes old tensions over voting and race]\n\nTensions mounted in the weeks before Election Day after the revelation that thousands of voter registration applications had been suspended, most of them belonging to people of color or immigrants, under a new state law requiring an exact match between the application and driver or Social Security records. Separately, hundreds of absentee ballots were challenged by officials, many in minority-heavy Gwinett County.\n\nOn Tuesday, voters at one polling location in Gwinett County reported a wait of more than four hours to cast ballots.\n\n\u201cThis was voter suppression at its finest,\u201d said Takeya Sneeze, an African American truck driver who said she watched 100 voters leave a polling location at an elementary school without casting ballots after discovering that the machines were not working.\n\nSneeze said she went to Walmart twice to get water and snacks to encourage people to stay in line and wait.\n\nJoe Sorenson, a spokesman for Gwinnett County, said that voting at the elementary school would be extended 25 minutes but that any further extension would require a judge\u2019s order.\n\nSorenson said the county encountered problems at five polling locations out of 156. One had the wrong electrical power cords for its equipment, and the others had issues with polling machines, but he said officials discovered the problems quickly and began issuing provisional ballots.\n\nBrittany Herbert, 32, a lawyer, said she arrived at the Pittman Park Recreation Center in Southwest Atlanta at 8 a.m. and found the polling place in chaos. When she tried to check in, she was told she\u2019d have to wait, so she left to go to work and returned about 4:15 p.m. At 5:15, she estimated that she had another 45 minutes to wait.\n\n\u201cVoting is always really important to me,\u201d she said. \u201cI knew at the end of the day I had to. I also knew that my family and friends would shame me if I didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for the Fulton County elections office acknowledged that a handful of polling places encountered problems Tuesday.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s election is a big one for this state, and there are a lot of enthusiastic voters out there,\u201d said spokeswoman April Majors. \u201cWe\u2019re happy about that, but unfortunately, the enthusiasm is what is causing the long lines.\u201d\n\n[Without evidence, Trump and Sessions warn of voter fraud in Tuesday\u2019s elections]\n\nVanessa Williams in Atlanta, Cleve Wootson in Washington, Sonam Vashi in Snellville, Ga., Bob Moore in El Paso and Kirk Ross in Chapel Hill, N.C., contributed to this report.", "The Supreme Court spent a gruesome hour Tuesday debating a constitutional way to execute a Missouri man who has a rare medical condition, with the likely decider, new Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, joining the court\u2019s liberals with tough questions for the state.\n\nModern and ancient execution methods \u2014 a firing squad, electrocution, hanging, lethal gas, being burned at the stake \u2014 all made appearances during the court\u2019s sober assessment of ways to kill Russell Bucklew without violating the Constitution\u2019s ban on cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nMissouri plans to use an injection of a single drug, pentobarbital, to carry out the long-delayed execution of Bucklew. But he suffers from a congenital and rare disease called cavernous hemangioma. It causes blood-filled tumors to grow in his head, neck and throat, which his attorneys say could rupture during the state\u2019s lethal injection process.\n\nThe result, they contend, would be that he could choke to death on his own blood.\n\nThe Supreme Court has been considering Bucklew\u2019s fate for years. In March, it voted 5 to 4 to delay his execution and hear his new challenge, which proposes he be killed using gas, something Missouri authorizes but has never done.\n\n[Justices halt Missouri execution]\n\n\n\nRussell Bucklew in 2014. (Missouri Department of Corrections/AP)\n\nThe state\u2019s lawyers say that Bucklew cannot prove his condition would cause him an abnormal amount of suffering and that his legal fight is a ploy to further delay his punishment and open a new line of legal challenges.\n\nJustice Anthony M. Kennedy was a member of the majority last spring. He has been replaced by Kavanaugh, who is considered more conservative but who was never called upon to rule on an execution as a member of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.\n\nKavanaugh directed all of his questions to Missouri Solicitor General D. John Sauer, pressing him on the outer bounds of the state\u2019s arguments.\n\n\u201cAre you saying even if the method creates gruesome and brutal pain you can still do it because there\u2019s no alternative?\u201d Kavanaugh asked.\n\nSauer replied that under the court\u2019s previous rulings, Bucklew would have to come up with an alternative manner of execution acceptable to the state.\n\nKavanaugh pressed, \u201cIs that a yes?\u201d\n\nSauer replied, \u201cYes, it is, your honor.\u201d\n\nLater, Kavanaugh asked whether the state had planned to make any special accommodations for Bucklew\u2019s condition, such as whether he would be lying supine on a gurney or with his head elevated.\n\n\u201cYour opposing counsel said, even if everything goes according to plan, there will still be significant suffering. Can you respond to that?\u201d Kavanaugh asked.\n\n\u201cI absolutely, absolutely disagree with that,\u201d Sauer said.\n\nThe court\u2019s attention to such details about the execution was warranted because of the specific nature of Bucklew\u2019s case.\n\nHe is not contesting his guilt or his sentence of death.\n\nIn 1996, Bucklew, now 50, stalked his former girlfriend Stephanie Ray at another man\u2019s trailer. He shot and killed the man, Michael Sanders, tried to shoot Ray\u2019s fleeing child and then captured Ray. He handcuffed and raped her, then wounded a police officer in a subsequent gunfight.\n\nBucklew later escaped from jail and attacked Ray\u2019s mother with a hammer before he was recaptured.\n\nHe also is not challenging the constitutionality of the death penalty, or even of Missouri\u2019s lethal injection procedure. His claim is that applied to his specific condition, the protocol would result in the kind of tortured death the Constitution forbids.\n\nA divided court has upheld lethal injection against challenges. And it has indicated that an inmate who makes a challenge specific to his condition must propose an alternative manner of execution.\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor has been the court\u2019s most outspoken critic of that decision and said Tuesday that her colleagues had \u201cmade up\u201d that requirement without constitutional justification.\n\nNonetheless, she tried to narrow the impact of ruling for Bucklew.\n\nIt \u201cis not going to abolish the death penalty with respect to everybody,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to tell the state: If you have an individual with a unique circumstance in which a method of execution is going to cause that person excruciating pain, cruel and unusual pain, you better find a different way.\u201d\n\nJustice Stephen G. Breyer pressed Kavanaugh\u2019s point. He said all would agree that burning someone at the stake would violate the Constitution, so why wouldn\u2019t an inmate be able to challenge a method of death that had the same physical sensation for the condemned.\n\nChief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., court conservatives, were the toughest questioners of Bucklew\u2019s attorney, Robert Hochman of Chicago.\n\nAlito questioned how Hochman could know that executing Bucklew with lethal gas would cause fewer problems than lethal injection.\n\nAnd Roberts wondered about the defense\u2019s true intentions in proposing lethal gas.\n\n\u201cHow can it be a reasonable alternative if it\u2019s never been used before?\u201d Roberts asked, adding that death-penalty litigation often involves challenges to untested execution protocols. \u201cIt seems to me that if you have a method that no state has ever used, that that danger is magnified.\u201d\n\nSauer picked up on that. He said the reason that inmates must be required to choose an \u201calternative method of execution that is readily feasible\u201d is to avoid giving their attorneys \u201cevery incentive to engage in interminable litigation, interminable litigation, multiple challenges.\u201d\n\nBreyer suggested the case was not ready for a decision by the justices, that there were factual disagreements in the case that should be decided by lower courts.\n\nAnd Sotomayor noted that Bucklew\u2019s condition was constantly changing.\n\nHe underwent a tracheotomy this summer, and she asked Hochman whether the tube was still in place. He said that it was and that he did not know when or whether it would be removed.\n\n\u201cIf the trach stays, it\u2019s a totally different case than if it\u2019s removed,\u201d Sotomayor said.\n\nThe case is Bucklew v. Precythe, and it could be months before the court renders a decision.", "Opinion writer\n\nWhen you see a long line outside a polling place, it\u2019s reasonable to think two things simultaneously.

Others are outright voter suppression; when a majority-Hispanic city with a population of 28,000 has just one polling place and just before the election, officials move it out of the center of town to a location a mile away from the nearest bus stop, it\u2019s pretty clear officials don\u2019t want people to vote. Still other times it\u2019s just the result of happenstance, inadequate preparation and inadequate funding.\n\nBut what we can say without question is that the United States\u2019 system of voting is terrible. A couple of years ago, an international comparison rated the United States\u2019 as the worst electoral system among long-established democracies, and 47th in the world overall.\n\nWhy is it like this? There are many reasons, but at the heart of most of them is the decentralized nature of the system.\n\nInstead of doing what they do in most countries \u2014 have a system run by the federal government that can impose uniformity and adequately fund voting \u2014 we have a system run by states, counties, cities and towns. In some places they do a great job. In some places they do a terrible job. A big part of the administration is handled not by professionals but by volunteers, who may have had little training on the systems they\u2019re using and have trouble solving problems that occur on Election Day.\n\nAnd of course, the decentralized nature of the system leaves it open to manipulation by people who want to make it work poorly, at least for some voters. If you\u2019ve been following the Georgia governor\u2019s race, where the Republican candidate, Brian Kemp, is also the secretary of state and one of the most aggressive vote suppressors in the country, you know what I\u2019m talking about \u2014 and you\u2019re completely unsurprised to hear that there are problems at polling places in heavily minority areas in the state.\n\nI\u2019m not saying that Republican officials intentionally sabotage the system for minority voters. But it does seem like an unusual coincidence when in every election we hear story after story about minority neighborhoods where machines break, they run out of ballots or some other mishap leads to people standing for hours waiting to vote while many give up and go home \u2014 and yet we don\u2019t see nearly as many of those problems in areas where lots of conservative white people live.\n\nBut imagine what it would be like if we had an election and there were almost no problems. Imagine if everyone who wanted to vote could vote. If you weren\u2019t worried that you\u2019d been purged unfairly from the rolls. If you didn\u2019t have to travel long distances and need a car to get to a polling place, or wait in line for hours or be told that you had the wrong kind of ID. If you weren\u2019t unsure that your vote would actually be tallied correctly.\n\nMy preference would be to nationalize voting, at least to the extent of imposing systems, rules and procedures we can all agree on to make things work more efficiently. But there are other things we can do in the meantime to make Election Day and what leads up to it less stressful.\n\nFirst, we can pass automatic voter registration everywhere. Registration is just one more hurdle to voting, and we should make it automatic for everyone. At a minimum, we should have same-day registration (which is already available in 17 states plus the District) so it isn\u2019t something people have to worry about beforehand.\n\nNext, we can expand early voting so that people can do it at their leisure in the days leading up to the election. And we should make Election Day a national holiday, so no one has to take off work in order to do it and we don\u2019t get the early-morning and post-work rushes that result in long lines.\n\nAnd more states should move to universal vote by mail, which can increase turnout and make things dramatically easier for people with disabilities, people with difficult work schedules and, really, anyone.\n\nThose are just a few of the reforms we could adopt. But more than anything else, what we have to do is decide that we don\u2019t need to live with the problems we have now. We can have a better system. Other advanced democracies do. We make a choice to have our system be such a mess; we just need to make a different choice.\n\nRead more:\n\nCatherine Rampell: Voter suppression has become especially flagrant.

Be higher,\u201d said MSNBC host Stephanie Ruhle on Tuesday morning as she introduced her campaign coverage.\n\n\u201cThe day to decide the balance of power is here and for Democrats, the stakes for this race and the future of their party could not be higher,\u201d said \u201cFox & Friends\u201d co-host Brian Kilmeade, also Tuesday morning.\n\n\u201cThe stakes really couldn\u2019t be higher tonight,\u201d said Anderson Cooper on Monday night upon introducing a large panel of pundits.\n\n\u201cIn just three days, voters will head to the polls and cast their ballots in the 2018 midterm elections. The stakes couldn\u2019t be higher,\u201d said host S.E. Cupp on Saturday on her CNN show.\n\nAnd please trust the Erik Wemple Blog: There is much, much more talk of sky-high stakes in recent cable-news archives.\n\nMay it never be said that the cable-news channels and their varying ideologies don\u2019t agree on anything. They fully agree, as it turns out, that the imperative of drawing as many viewers to their 2018 midterm elections coverage warrants hyperbole. You\u2019ll hear it every two years. As the Erik Wemple Blog wrote during the 2016 presidential election, CNN created something of a stakes trap for itself as its coverage proceeded through debates and primary elections. At each stop, it cited the sky-high stakes, eventually running out of superlatives.\n\nAt least the deployment of stakes-oriented exaggeration in 2016 had some resonance. That election, after all, brought us the Trump presidency, with its unprecedented division, incompetence, racism, anti-constitutional norms and, yes, Trump supporters, a continuation of President Barack Obama\u2019s economic recovery. Even President Trump has scoffed at the idea that Tuesday\u2019s contests are transcendent. \u201cYour vote in 2018 is every bit as important as your vote in 2016,\u201d he said in a speech earlier this year, before checking himself: \u201cAlthough I\u2019m not sure I really believe that. You know. I don\u2019t know who the hell wrote that line, I\u2019m not sure. \u2026 But it\u2019s still important, remember.\u201d\n\nObama went with the cable-news formulation at a recent stop: \u201cHope is still out there. We just have to stand up and speak for it. And in two days, Illinois, in two days, you get to vote in what might be the most important election of my lifetime, maybe more important than 2008,\u201d said the two-term president.\n\nPoliticians are allowed to hype elections; that\u2019s how they encourage people to vote.\n\nNews organizations, not quite so much. They\u2019re supposed to offer sober and factual evaluations of the country\u2019s circumstances, not cliches designed to keep viewers from pressing the \u201coff\u201d button.\n\nBut hey, this is the Trump era. He has abused superlatives to the point of decommissioning them: hiring the \u201cbest people\u201d (doubtful); engineering the \u201cgreatest economy\u201d in U.S. history (false); and \u2026well, let\u2019s just turn it over to The Post\u2019s Dana Milbank:\n\nHis \u201cI.Q. is one of the highest.\u201d He has \u201cthe best words.\u201d He is a \u201cstable genius.\u201d He has \u201cone of the great memories of all time.\u201d He was \u201calways the best athlete.\u201d His building makes \u201cthe best taco bowls.\u201d He knows more about the Islamic State than the generals, and nobody \u201cin the history of the world\u201d knows more about taxes than Trump.\n\nSo maybe we won\u2019t come down too hard on cable news for exaggerating the stakes surrounding an electoral verdict on the very worst president in modern U.S. history.\n\nRead more:\n\nFox News\u2019s Sean Hannity: Proud to be a Trump operative\n\nWhat took U.S. media orgs so long to realize Trump ad was racist?

Days later, thousands of supporters have flooded a GoFundMe account, raising more than $149,000.\n\nThe altercation began at Maywood Academy High School when Marston Riley asked a male student, who was improperly dressed and in violation of the school uniform rules, to leave the room, the Sacramento Bee reported. A cellphone video shows the teenager refusing, then throwing a basketball at the teacher, who is black, and saying, \u201cWhy you wisecracking, my n-----?\u201d\n\nThe Sacramento Bee also reported that Riley appeared to call for backup from school authorities.\n\nRiley then let loose on the boy, reportedly pummeling him repeatedly. Some students looked on or jumped in to break up the fight. Others pulled out smartphones and recorded the brawl.\n\nThe student was taken to a hospital. Riley was arrested Friday on child-abuse charges by the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department\u2019s special victims bureau.\n\nCecilia Diaz Jimenez, a former colleague and current school district employee, quickly launched a GoFundMe page to raise funds for Riley\u2019s legal fees, writing: \u201cHe is going to need all the help he can get. Be mindful that the school district is looking at dismissing him and I would not doubt if the student\u2019s parents are looking into pressing criminal charges. I am sure Mr. Riley will need money to pay any fines, fees and lawyers.\u201d\n\n[A Florida teacher drowned wild raccoons with his students\u2019 help.

On Saturday, she posted a YouTube video with a message from Riley, who called the donors a \u201cblessing.\u201d\n\nIn four days, the campaign surpassed $149,000, far more than its $50,000 goal.\n\nJimenez is not alone in her support of Riley.\n\nOn Monday, students gathered outside the school holding posters lined with music notes that read: \u201cRiley deserves better\u201d and \u201cJustice for Riley.\u201d\n\nNajee Ali, a local parent, also told The Washington Post that he supports Riley.\n\n\u201cMany of us identify with this teacher, who is loved and respected by his students. We don\u2019t condone physical violence against any student, but we also don\u2019t condone racial slurs or threats directed at any teacher,\u201d he said.\n\nThe faction supporting Riley also intends to hire a private investigator to \u201csearch for the truth,\u201d Ali said.\n\nRiley has since posted a $50,000 bond and was released Saturday, according to the Sheriff\u2019s Department. He is scheduled to appear in court Nov. 30; the local district attorney\u2019s office does not have a case filed against Riley, who could not be reached for comment.\n\nAfter Riley\u2019s release, the Los Angeles Unified School District issued a statement Monday calling the behavior \u201cdisturbing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe take this matter very seriously and do not condone violence or intolerance of any kind,\u201d the statement said.\n\nA spokesman said that the agency could not comment further because of an ongoing investigation.\n\nRead more:\n\nBowie State marching band suspended after hazing allegations\n\nMajor donors, other leaders condemn the board and call for U-Md. president to remain\n\nD.C. charter schools argue in appeals court that city is breaking federal law and funding them unequally\n\nMontessori, long a favorite for wealthy families, struggles to expand its reach", "Living next to Cabinet officials can be tough on Washingtonians. But the events that unfolded Monday night in front of Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke\u2019s home were weird by any standards.\n\nThe Mercedes SUV had been idling for two hours and was taking up three parking spots on the 100 block of Kentucky Avenue SE. So Lincoln Park resident Gina Arlotto asked the driver to turn off the engine and back up to free two parking spots, she said Tuesday. The driver didn\u2019t move the car, but he killed the engine.\n\nNeighbor Paul Legere was coming home from work when his wife called to warn him the car had been idling for hours on the block, a notoriously difficult place to find parking.\n\nWhen Legere arrived, he too asked the driver to move to create a parking space. Again, the driver refused.\n\n\u201cWe had some words,\u201d Legere said. \u201cI\u2019ve had some parking issues in the past. This was not a government SUV. He wouldn\u2019t identify himself. He said he was waiting for his boss.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s when a man who appeared to be about 6 feet tall, white and about 30 years old emerged from Zinke\u2019s front door.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018I\u2019m Ryan Zinke.\u2019 I said, \u2018Dude, you\u2019re not Zinke.\u2019 I asked, \u2018Who are you?\u2019 \" Legere recounted.\n\nHe said his name was Scott. \"Scott what?\u201d\n\nAccording to Legere, the man wheeled around toward the house without an answer and muttered as he walked to the front door. Within minutes, by about 9:30 p.m., U.S. Park Police arrived. Neighbors assumed the man named \u201cScott\u201d had called them, as Park Police fall under Zinke\u2019s department.\n\nBut it turns out it was the secretary himself.\n\nInterior spokeswoman Faith Vander Voort said in an email that Zinke was inside his house at the time, watching football and barbecuing with friends. He alerted his protective security detail \u201cabout a suspicious individual staking out his home and guests.\u201d\n\n\n\nPosters of Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke have been plastered on street corners near the Interior Department offices in Washington. The posters, like this one on 19th Street NW, portray Zinke as a vampire with a message that says \"Count Corruption.\" (Robert Miller/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cWhile waiting for the [U.S. Park Police] to arrive, another individual began yelling profanities in the street about the President and the Secretary,\u201d she added. \"The Secretary remained inside his home the entire night while the [Park Police] responded.\u201d\n\nAsked whether the \u201csuspicious individual\u201d was a neighbor or the driver who had been idling outside, and for details about the individual who impersonated Zinke, Vander Voort referred a reporter to the Park Police.\n\nSgt. Eduardo Delgado, a Park Police spokesman, said that when police responded to Zinke\u2019s call, they did not find a suspicious person. The idling car in front of the secretary\u2019s house was gone, he said, and the neighbors took the opportunity to tell the police their version of the story.\n\nArlotto said that profanities were exchanged between Legere and the driver before the police arrived.\n\n\u201cThere were a lot of f-bombs,\u201d she said. But she didn\u2019t hear any profanities aimed at either the president or the secretary.\n\nLegere, who saw the police from his house, figured they would want to speak with him, so he walked over.\n\n\u201cThey said this is all a big misunderstanding,\u201d Legere recalled. \u201cWe were all in agreement that this wasn\u2019t Zinke.\u201d\n\nZinke and his wife have lived in the rental home since he began serving in Congress in 2015, Arlotto said, and have not been seen frequently in the neighborhood in recent months. The guest who impersonated Zinke, along with three or four other men, all left the house and piled into the Mercedes around 10 p.m.\n\n\u201cI just think it\u2019s outrageous that he called the Park Police on a neighbor,\u201d Arlotto said. \u201cI felt that he wanted to harass us.\u201d\n\nZinke has come under scrutiny in recent months for his travel practices and real estate dealings back home in Montana. A report released last month by the Interior Office of Inspector General said that Zinke had his wife accompany him in government vehicles, even though that was prohibited under the department\u2019s motor vehicle policy. Zinke changed the policy in July to allow for members of his family to ride with him in department vehicles when it was for official events.\n\nMonday night\u2019s incident was all the talk of the Lincoln Park email group by Tuesday morning, as Arlotto voiced her frustration online.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still pretty annoyed at this person pretending to be Zinke to intimidate a neighbor, and then calling the Park Police for protection, but I guess that\u2019s just me,\u201d she posted at 5:07 a.m. \u201cNothing makes sense anymore.\u201d", "At least nine associates of longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone have been contacted by the special counsel. (Kevin Lamarque/Reuters)\n\nTwo more associates of Roger Stone, the longtime adviser to President Trump, testified recently before a grand jury hearing evidence in the investigation into Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 presidential election \u2014 the latest in a series of witnesses connected to Stone whose testimony has been sought by the special counsel.\n\nDavid Lugo, a filmmaker who interviewed Stone for a movie, told The Washington Post Tuesday that he has turned over hundreds of text messages, emails and Facebook messages to the grand jury.\n\nLugo, who was a co-producer on the 2015 Oliver Stone film, \u201cA Good American,\u201d also said he testified on Oct. 19 before the grand jury about conversations about WikiLeaks he had with a onetime friend of Stone, New York comedian Randy Credico.\n\nSeparately, attorney Tyler Nixon, another Stone associate, confirmed to The Post that he testified before the grand jury Friday.\n\nThe appearances by Lugo and Nixon underscore how intensely special counsel Robert S. Mueller III is pursuing the question of whether Stone had advance knowledge of WikiLeaks\u2019s plans to release hacked Democratic emails that roiled the 2016 campaign and damaged Hillary Clinton\u2019s White House bid. At least nine Stone associates have been contacted by prosecutors so far.\n\nA spokesman for Mueller declined to comment.\n\nIn July, Mueller\u2019s prosecutors charged 12 Russian military officers with engineering the hack of Democratic accounts and giving the emails to WikiLeaks.\n\nStone has denied any contact with WikiLeaks and said he did not know the content of material before it was published.\n\nBoth Lugo and Nixon told The Post last month that Credico acknowledged in conversations being the source of material for Stone\u2019s statements and tweets about WikiLeaks.\n\nAnother Stone associate, conservative author Jerome Corsi, was interviewed by Mueller\u2019s team over three days last week and appears to be emerging as a key witness, according to a person familiar with the sessions who requested anonymity to describe the ongoing investigation.\n\nStone has said that research by Corsi about Clinton campaign chief John Podesta and his lobbyist brother Tony prompted him to tweet \u201cit will soon the Podesta\u2019s time in the barrel\u201d on Aug. 21, 2016. The tweet came about six weeks before WikiLeaks began publishing emails hacked from John Podesta\u2019s account.\n\nDavid Gray, a lawyer for Corsi, declined to comment.\n\nLugo said Tuesday that his testimony before the grand jury was focused on Credico, another significant player in the Stone saga.\n\n[Special counsel examines conflicting accounts as scrutiny of Roger Stone and WikiLeaks deepens]\n\nStone has said Credico was his principal source of information about WikiLeaks, an allegation Credico denies. Stone also identified Credico as his source in a letter to the House Intelligence Committee last year.\n\nDuring his 35- to 45-minute appearance, Lugo said, prosecutors asked him about communications he had with Credico in the spring of 2017. The Post reported last month that Credico had sent a text message to Lugo in which the comic appeared to acknowledge that he provided inside information about WikiLeaks to Stone.\n\nIn the message, which Lugo provided to The Post, Credico said: \u201cI knew Rodger [sic] was going to name me sooner or later and so I told you that I\u2019m the so-called back Channel.\u201d\n\nLugo was called to testify two days before The Post published its story.\n\nCredico said Tuesday in a text message to The Post that Lugo is an \u201calt-right Stone acolyte. Rodger [sic] hypnotizes guy to do all of this.\u201d\n\nCredico added that Lugo \u201cwould die for Rodger Stone . . . Don\u2019t you understand that stone put them up to this.\u201d\n\nStone noted in a message to The Post Tuesday that Lugo and Nixon testified under oath about their experiences. \u201cI have no hypnotic powers,\u201d he said.\n\n[Roger Stone helped Donald Trump get elected president \u2014 now he\u2019s helping himself]\n\nThe Post reported last month that Nixon attended a dinner during which he said Credico acknowledged being Stone\u2019s WikiLeaks source.\n\nNixon confirmed Tuesday he was called to appear before the grand jury after the publication of The Post\u2019s story, but he did not provide details about his testimony. His appearance was first reported by the Daily Caller.\n\nDuring Lugo\u2019s grand jury appearance, the filmmaker said prosecutors asked him about messages that he claims show Credico attempting to intimidate him not to reveal conversations about whether the comic was a Stone source. Lugo said he told the grand jury that Credico tried to pressure him to be silent by threatening to \u201ccall me out as an extreme right winger and a disciple of Roger Stone.\u201d\n\nLugo said he also testified about communications with Credico regarding the possibility of the comic helping to set up an interview with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange for a film he was working on about online censorship called \u201cSensational.\u201d Credico had previously interviewed Assange on his radio program.\n\nLugo said he told grand jurors that the comedian wanted Lugo to film him last year conducting an interview with Assange at the Ecuadoran embassy in London, where the WikiLeaks founder has been detained for years.

The statement added, \u201cThis was an unfortunate distraction and has been addressed.\u201d\n\nAddressed how? Fox didn\u2019t say in its statement, and a representative offered no further comment.\n\nOn Monday, Hannity assured his nearly 4 million Twitter followers that he would not join Trump on stage for his rally in Cape Girardeau, Mo., and that he would not campaign with him. While the Trump team described him as a \u201cspecial guest,\u201d the top-rated host maintained that he was simply covering the president\u2019s final rally for his show. \u201cSomething I have done in every election in the past,\u201d he added.\n\nAbout 12 hours later, though, he delivered a lengthy campaign advertisement for the president, and for the Republican Party, and then joined Trump onstage to recite his achievements and thank him. \u201cPromises made, promises kept,\u201d said Hannity, echoing the president\u2019s campaign slogan.\n\nHannity also pointed to the press corral at the rally and added, \u201cBy the way, all those people in the back are fake news.\u201d The press contingent included reporters and producers from Fox News, which was covering the rally.\n\n\n\nPresident Trump greets Fox talk show host Sean Hannity at a rally in Cape Girardeau, Mo.i on Monday. (Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nHannity tried to clean up both his broken promise not to campaign for Trump and his apparent insult of his own network\u2019s journalists in a tweet Tuesday: \u201cWhat I said in my tweet yesterday was 100% truthful,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWhen the POTUS invited me on stage to give a few remarks last night, I was surprised, yet honored by the president\u2019s request. This was NOT planned. And to be clear, I was not referring to my journalist colleagues at FOX News in those remarks. They do amazing work day in and day out in a fair and balanced way and It is an honor to work with such great professionals.\u201d\n\nPirro also appeared at the rally but had no comment about it afterward.\n\nHannity has been a close Trump ally and has assiduously cultivated the president\u2019s approval \u2014 sometimes to the point of going beyond Fox\u2019s rules banning such close association with a political figure.\n\nIn 2016, he appeared in a promotional video for Trump\u2019s campaign, enumerating his reasons for supporting the Republican candidate, from his plan to \u201cput originalists on the Supreme Court\u201d to his promise to \u201cvet refugees.\u201d\n\nSince then, Hannity has not just backed the president\u2019s agenda. He has also parroted his rhetoric. For instance, he has denounced journalists for presenting an unvarnished view of the administration.\n\nMonday\u2019s rally was in Cape Girardeau, a small city on the banks of the Mississippi River that is the hometown of radio host Rush Limbaugh. The local fixture \u2014 and hero of the conservative base \u2014 appeared at the rally as well. Trump on Monday also called in to the radio show hosted by right-wing commentator Mark Levin, underscoring his ability to circumvent the traditional news media as he made his closing pitch to voters.\n\nBut it was a set of unscripted interactions between Trump and his allies at Fox that was most striking, turning his final midterms appearance into a display of the White House\u2019s unique alliance with the conservative-leaning news channel. The cocoon of right-wing media rose around Trump as voters prepared to go to the polls to deliver a verdict on the first two years of his presidency.\n\nTrump has been overtly hostile to the mainstream media but has a cozy relationship with Fox, prompting criticism that he sees the news channel as state TV.\n\nSome at the network bristle at this suggestion. Martha MacCallum, who is set to co-anchor the network\u2019s live election coverage Tuesday night alongside fellow anchor Bret Baier, told the Philadelphia Inquirer this week that it was a misconception to see Fox as \u201cstate-run television.\u201d Baier told the New Yorker earlier in the year that it \u201cpains\u201d him to hear the network described this way.\n\nMost vocal in dissenting from the pro-Trump line has been Shepard Smith, who last week took the administration to task for fearmongering in discussing the caravan of Central American migrants heading toward the southern border, telling his viewers: \u201cThere is no invasion. No one\u2019s coming to get you. There\u2019s nothing at all to worry about.\u201d\n\nBut Monday\u2019s rally was awash with evidence that the president sees some of Fox\u2019s most visible personalities as surrogates in his political crusade. And, perhaps even more notably, the event illustrated their willingness to fulfill that function.\n\nDespite his assurance that he wouldn\u2019t join the president on the stump, Hannity spent the time before he went live posing for selfies with audience members and revving up the crowd. And after a fact-challenged opening monologue touting the president\u2019s accomplishments \u2014 the tax measure approved last year was not the \u201csingle biggest middle-class tax cut in American history\u201d \u2014 Hannity engaged Trump in a 10-minute back-and-forth about the success of his administration and the weakness of his Democratic critics.\n\nHannity told Trump how popular he was among his supporters.\n\n\u201cI went out there an hour before the show, and the crowd is electric,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery hat I signed . . . every hat was soaking wet. There\u2019s a bigger crowd outside than there is inside.\u201d\n\nHis only complaint? That the president had missed his opening monologue.\n\nNot so, Trump comforted him.\n\n\u201cNo, I saw it on the plane,\u201d he said. \u201cActually, I saw it on the plane. I never miss your opening monologue. I would never do that.\u201d\n\nAt the end of the conversation, billed by Fox as a \u201cpowerful interview,\u201d Laura Ingraham, another host and Trump proponent, was standing by for her 10 p.m. slot. \u201cWant to say hi to the president?\u201d Hannity asked her.\n\nShe did and was promptly informed by Trump that he was \u201cvery proud of her.\u201d Feigning jealousy that Ingraham got \u201call the compliments,\u201d Hannity turned to Trump and issued compliments of his own, telling the president, \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone has your energy level.\u201d\n\nAfter the dialogue, Bill Shine, the Fox executive turned White House communications director, gave Hannity a high-five, according to a White House pool report. In 2010, when Fox learned that the tea party was advertising Hannity\u2019s appearance at a fundraising event, the network barred him from attending. The network executive who explained why he had been barred \u2014 saying political activists were \u201ccharging for access to Sean\u201d \u2014 was none other than Shine.\n\nOnce on stage, Trump wasted no time trotting out his allies at Fox.\n\n\u201cI have a few people that are right out here. And they\u2019re very special. They\u2019ve done an incredible job for us. They\u2019ve been with us from the beginning,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to start by saying Sean Hannity, come on up \u2014 Sean Hannity,\u201d Trump said. Supporters clapped and waved.\n\nThey embraced, and Trump gestured for Hannity to take the podium \u2014 not a typical position for a television host who interviews the president.

(Tannen Maury/EPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nToday, the first Tuesday after Nov. 1, American voters (some of us, at least) will head to the polls, as we\u2019ve done in every even-numbered year since 1845.\n\nYou probably know by now that the United States has one of the lowest voter turnout rates among the world\u2019s advanced democracies, with midterm years seeing particularly weak levels of participation. Some of this low turnout is no accident: Certain states make voting a lot more difficult than others, ostensibly to combat \u201cvoter fraud\u201d but arguably simply to skew the electorate in the governing party\u2019s favor.\n\nMany political scientists say that there\u2019s one simple thing the federal government could do to increase voter participation nationwide: Make Election Day a holiday or simply move it to the weekend. The United States, as it turns out, is an outlier among developed nations for holding elections in the middle of the week rather than on the weekend. Among the 36 member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, for instance, 27 held their most recent nationwide elections on a Saturday or Sunday.\n\n\n\n(Illustration by Christopher Ingraham for the Washington Post)\n\nJust nine of them, including the United States, held elections during the week. And at least one of those countries, South Korea, makes elections a national holiday.\n\nWould moving elections to the weekend increase voter turnout? Political scientists Adam Bonica and Michael McFaul say it would. \u201cFinding time to vote during a workday imposes a significant burden that falls disproportionately on workers and students, who frequently cite scheduling conflicts with work or school as their reason for not voting,\u201d they wrote in a Washington Post op-ed last month.\n\nAfter the last midterm election, more than a third of registered voters who didn\u2019t cast a ballot told the Pew Research Center that scheduling conflicts with work or school were the reason they didn\u2019t vote.\n\nBonica and McFaul also point to census data showing that \u201csalaried professionals with flexible work schedules such as lawyers, educators and executives\u201d report higher turnout than \u201chourly paid workers in service jobs in restaurants and retail.\u201d\n\nMoving elections to the weekend or a holiday might improve those numbers. Over the past decade, several bills have been introduced by House and Senate Democrats to change Election Day to a national holiday or move it to a weekend.

(Paul Sancya/AP)\n\nThe Monday afternoon call was innocuous at first.\n\nBrenda Battel, a staff writer for the Huron Daily Tribune in rural Michigan, was seeking a chance to speak with Republican Senate candidate John James on Wednesday after the election.\n\nBattel left a voice-mail message with the James campaign, and alerted it to a potential follow-up email to further discuss his campaign against Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D).\n\nThen Battel hung up the phone \u2014 or so she believed, she later said.\n\n\u201cMan, if he beats her \u2026 Jesus! F---ing John James. That would suck!\u201d Battel is heard saying in a voice mail released by the James campaign. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to happen though.\u201d\n\nThe incident prompted the Daily Tribune to fire Battel later Monday after less than three years on staff.\n\nBattel responded Wednesday in a statement.\n\n\u201cWhile reporting the news, journalists must put their opinions aside and focus on facts. I was not reporting the news when I made derogatory statements about Mr. James and his campaign. That was 100 percent my opinion, and I did not expect that it would be for public consumption. I obviously have regrets and am embarrassed that it was released,\u201d she told The Washington Post.\n\n\u201cBut while doing my job, which was to gather and report the facts, I did not let my opinions interfere with telling the truth. I proved that in every news article I wrote for the Huron Daily Tribune.\u201d\n\nBattel said she was venting and only speaking to herself, and had not realized her words were recorded until someone sent her an online story about it.\n\nShe has been heavily criticized on social media, she added, but has not seen anyone raise any instances of bias in her reporting.\n\nEditor Kate Hessling said accountability was a primary concern for her decision to terminate Battel, amid plummeting public trust in reporters and withering attacks on the news media from President Trump.\n\n[Republicans attack Jewish candidates across the U.S. with an age-old caricature: Fistfuls of cash]\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s imperative that our reporters act professional and neutral when dealing with the public, and that was not done in this situation,\u201d Hessling told The Washington Post on Tuesday. \u201cAnd that was inexcusable.\u201d\n\nThe voice-mail message posted on YouTube by the James campaign was authentic, Hessling said.\n\nHessling said in a longer statement posted on the paper\u2019s website: \u201cThe Huron Daily Tribune sincerely apologizes to Mr. James and to the public. These statements do not represent the views of the Tribune as a whole, nor do they reflect the actions of a responsible journalist.\u201d\n\nThe paper, which serves a rural area in Michigan\u2019s so-called upper thumb area, has been reduced to three full-time staff writers and five total staff members, Hessling said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a very tiny newspaper,\u201d she said.\n\nJames\u2019s campaign seized upon the incident to attempt to draw a wide correlation between the Huron paper and other forms of media.\n\n\u201cIt shows you that some media will do anything to keep the status quo and career politicians in power,\u201d campaign manager Tori Sachs said.\n\nJames trailed double digits behind Stabenow, but his campaign \u2014 which accepted money from a white supremacist, according to the Detroit Metro Times \u2014 sought Trump\u2019s help to raise the candidate\u2019s profile. It has also suggested that a stunning upset could once again happen in Michigan \u2014 a crucial state Trump narrowly won in 2016. Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.) edged out Hillary Clinton in the Democratic presidential primary election there.\n\nOn Tuesday, Stabenow defeated James to win reelection to the U.S. Senate from Michigan, the Associated Press projected.\n\nThe incident with Battel inflamed conservative outlets, including the Daily Caller, which first reported the story, with what they consider evidence of widespread liberal bias in the media.\n\nFox News Channel anchor Tucker Carlson asked James on Tuesday evening about the incident.\n\n\u201cI think this is the indication that you\u2019re getting, the uphill battle that many of us are facing because of a lot of the bias we\u2019re seeing out there,\u201d James said. \u201cIt\u2019s just not fair for those who share different opinions than some in the progressive liberal media.\u201d\n\nJames, on Fox News, decried media bias the same night that Carlson\u2019s colleague Sean Hannity appeared on stage with Trump at a rally in Missouri despite assurances that he would not.\n\n\u201cI will not be on stage campaigning with the President. I am covering final rally for my show,\u201d Hannity wrote on Twitter earlier Monday.\n\nBut Trump asked Hannity to join him on stage. He embraced Trump, thanked him and borrowed a term to describe media colleagues as \u201cfake news.\u201d The audience roared in approval.\n\nWhat I said in my tweet yesterday was 100% truthful. When the POTUS invited me on stage to give a few remarks last night, I was surprised, yet honored by the president\u2019s request. This was NOT planned. \u2014 Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) November 6, 2018\n\nLater Tuesday, Hannity downplayed the issue, saying on Twitter that the moment on stage was spontaneous and his barbs of \u201cfake news\u201d were not meant for his network colleagues.\n\nThe moment stunned reporters at Fox News, with one staffer telling CNN that a \u201cnew line was crossed\u201d after Hannity and fellow Fox News host Jeanine Pirro gave Trump their full-throated support at the event.\n\nAnother network weighed in over the issue: Fox News itself.\n\nThe network said it \u201cdoes not condone any talent participating in campaign events,\u201d Fox News said in a statement Friday evening. \u201cWe have an extraordinary team of journalists helming our coverage tonight and we are extremely proud of their work.

(Dominic Valente/For The Washington Post)\n\nVoter fraud is not a problem in the United States. Study after study has shown that few \u2014 if any \u2014 people vote illegally in American elections.\n\nStill, the issue has animated President Trump since he ran for office in 2016. On Monday, he once again tweeted about \u201cILLEGAL VOTING,\u201d cautioning that anyone caught casting a fake ballot would face \u201cMaximum Criminal Penalties.\u201d Trump also claimed \u2014 inaccurately \u2014 that fraud is common. \u201cJust take a look,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cThere are a lot of people . . . that try and get in illegally and actually vote illegally. So we just want to let them know that there will be prosecutions at the highest level.\"\n\nOf course, election fraud does happen around the world. Today, \u201cmore elections are being held, but more elections are also being rigged,\u201d according to \u201cHow to Rig an Election,\u201d a new book by British scholars Nic Cheeseman and Brian Klaas. And politicians can get pretty creative when it comes to guaranteeing a particular outcome.\n\n\"How to Rig an Election\u201d documents all kinds of inventive approaches: In one instance, officials in Ukraine tricked voters in opposition strongholds into using disappearing ink, so their ballots appeared blank by the time they were counted. In a Russian election, officials bribed men with the same name as their preferred candidate to run for his seat so voters would have a ballot that listed the same name three times.\n\nWhen Ferdinand Marcos was running for reelection in 1986, poll-watching group Namfrel issued a manual on likely cheating methods. As my colleague William Branigin reported at the time: \u201cIt is taken for granted here that cheating will occur \u2014 that voters will be bribed or intimidated, that ballots will be cast in the names of persons too young or too dead to vote, that attempts will be made to monitor the supposedly secret ballot and to falsify election returns for entire towns or provinces.\"\n\nIn some instances, so-called \u201cflying voters\u201d were paid to cast their ballots for a particular candidate. Voters were given a blank or fake ballot before stepping into their polling station. They would vote using the fake ballots and bring the real one backs as proof their votes were cast to the buyer\u2019s satisfaction.\n\n\u201cThese examples are effective but they\u2019re also very obvious,\u201d Cheeseman told me. \u201cYou know what the government is trying to do.\u201d\n\nMost times, Cheeseman said, voter fraud is much more mundane. According to his research, vote-buying occurs in about 40 percent of all elections; voters experience violence or intimidation about a quarter of the time. That might take the form of voters being kidnapped, polling stations being bombed or people being harassed or threatened on their way to vote.\n\nOne of Cheeseman\u2019s big concerns is the spread of misinformation, particularly over encrypted sites like WhatsApp. \u201cThe problem used to be voters might not have any information,\u201d he said. \u201cNow they have bad information.\u201d In his work, he has seen candidates sharing the wrong date of the election or claiming falsely a candidate dropped out.\n\nHe has also seen campaigns spread pretty vicious smears about their opponents. In one Brazilian race, a candidate was accused of designing penis-shaped baby bottles to make kids more comfortable with homosexuality.\n\nAuthoritarians also make it inconvenient to vote by closing polling stations or moving them without notice. Some voters are deregistered without their knowledge. Occasionally, the power at a polling station might be cut so real ballots can be swapped out for fake or pre-marked ones.\n\nIf that sounds familiar, it should: Misinformation and voter suppression have become more routine in the United States, watchdogs say, particularly under Republican leadership.\n\nIn Georgia, for example, Republican Brian Kemp is running for governor. Kemp is currently Georgia\u2019s secretary of state, and therefore in charge of his own election. Kemp has championed much tighter restrictions on who can vote, which critics say is an effort to suppress turnout among minority groups that historically support Democrats. Just days ago, Kemp claimed \u2014 without any evidence \u2014 Democrats had tried to hack into the state\u2019s election system.\n\nIn California, voters \u2014 as well as a Democratic candidate for office \u2014 say the state\u2019s website has been giving them incorrect information on polling locations. In North Dakota, a new rule requires voters to offer an ID displaying a physical address, a challenge for Native Americans who are less likely to have the appropriate documents.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the smartest kind of election rigging imaginable,\u201d Cheeseman said of voter ID laws. \u201cIt sells itself as protection to prevent other people from going to the polls.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nViolence around election time actually makes people more likely to vote\n\nThe Trailer: 18 moments that shaped the midterms\n\nWithout evidence, Trump and Sessions warn of voter fraud in Tuesday\u2019s elections", "Central American migrants, part of a caravan hoping to reach the U.S. gets settled in a shelter at the Jesus Martinez stadium, in Mexico City, Monday, Nov. 5, 2018.

The Uber was equipped with a dashboard camera that recorded the Oct. 29 conversation, which was later published online. The original video was removed, but it has been copied and reposted.\n\nThe players \u2014 Chris Wideman, Matt Duchene, Thomas Chabot, Dylan DeMelo, Alex Formenton, Chris Tierney and Colin White \u2014 are seen and heard in the video complaining about the team\u2019s penalty kill, which Raymond oversees, when the driver asks what team they play for.\n\n\u201cOttawa,\u201d Wideman, a defenseman, says in the clip. \u201cAs you can tell, we\u2019re really pleased with our [penalty kill].\"\n\nThe remarks were met with laughter as the players looked at statistics that showed the Senators' penalty kill ranked near the bottom of the NHL. As of Tuesday, Ottawa is killing penalties at a 68.8 percent rate, next to worst in the 31-team league.\n\nIn the video, the players criticize Raymond\u2019s coaching techniques.\n\n\u201cDo you notice that when [Raymond] runs the video, if you actually do pay attention, he doesn\u2019t ever teach you anything?\u201d Wideman asks in the recorded conversation. \u201cHe just commentates what\u2019s happening.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t change anything, ever,\u201d replies Duchene, a center. \u201cSo why do we even have a meeting?

It makes us cynical. But it also seems to be largely wasted, at least when it comes to advertising. Instead of getting money out of politics, perhaps candidates should wise up to the fact that donors, consultants and ad men have a self-interest in emphasizing the importance of money. But do you read all those mailers that cram your mailbox? Do you pay attention to political ads on TV? (Quick, what\u2019s the last one you saw for your congressional race, and what did it say?) Republicans have perfected the art of making a single, outrageous online ad, getting the buzz from media and spending practically nothing for it. Where money certainly may make a difference is pulling in new voters, registering voters and getting out the vote. (Those things could make the difference in the Florida and Georgia gubernatorial races and the Texas Senate race.) It would be interesting to see a candidate spend practically nothing on ads and spend almost everything on increasing the electorate and dragging their people to the polls.\n\nPolling \u2014 are you kidding me? I get probably two to three calls per day from pollsters, who are revealed as such on my phone\u2019s caller ID. I never pick up. The New York Times\u2019s live polling (a terrific innovation) will make 25,000 or even 40,000 calls to get 400 or so responses. I dunno, but that seems like you\u2019re practically begging for results that will miss the mark. I\u2019d like to know the profile of the busy people with caller ID who don\u2019t pick up \u2014 but you can\u2019t find out because they won\u2019t answer, etc. Likewise, fess up if you\u2019ve ever fudged your demographic information on automated polls. (Hmm, if I say I\u2019m an \u201cindependent,\u201d maybe it will make my candidate looks stronger.) And some of those questions become downright metaphysical. Does a child live with me if he\u2019s home mostly for holidays and summer? Is there a union member in the household if someone joined a union, but currently holds a nonunion job? I sort of admire candidates who don\u2019t poll themselves; if there are free, public polls that are of questionable accuracy, why pay good money for your own polls of questionable accuracy?\n\nIdeology: If people can vote for President Barack Obama in 2012 and Donald Trump in 2016, I\u2019m thinking that ideology plays a much smaller part in voters\u2019 decisions than we assume. Ideology seems to be cudgel to attack opponents in primaries (Not a real conservative!) or in general elections (Socialist!). CNBC\u2019s John Harwood hit the nail on the head, writing that just as Trump \u201cthrashed\u201d Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) by defying ideological conventions and practically flaunting his mercurial shifts in policy positions, \u201c[Rep. Beto] O\u2019Rourke seeks to scramble Cruz\u2019s ideological formula again. Defying left-right conventions, the third-term Democratic House member stands with liberals on key issues such as \u2018Medicare for all,\u2019 restrictions on gun rights, legal status for immigrant \u2018dreamers\u2019 and Trump\u2019s impeachment.\u201d Even if O\u2019Rourke doesn\u2019t pull the upset of the year, he has gotten really, really close by being \u2014 I hate the word but it works \u2014 authentic. A candidate\u2019s position on taxes or debt matters much less that if she is decent or relatable or seeking the right kind of change (e.g. eschewing money from political action committees, pushing for ethics reform, ending cronyism). There is growing evidence that how candidates make you feel is more important than their stances on a laundry list of issues.\n\nDespite all this, politicians and media are obsessed with money in politics, polling and ideological purity tests. Maybe those are more critical than I imagine, but it could be that great candidates beat poor ones, big personalities attract an outsize share of free press and people pick candidates for who they are, not for the white papers their staff produces or the ideological rating they get from partisan groups.

(Chronicle Books)\n\nReporter\n\nAuthor Dave Eggers\u2019s books are always welcome, but this one is particularly so at a time when there is a national debate about insufficient civics education and how to engage young people in the civic life of their neighborhoods and country.\n\n\u201cWhat Can a Citizen Do?,\u201d illustrated by Shawn Harris, explains to kids what being a citizen means and how they can be a good one. The charming book provides examples and sends the message that citizens aren\u2019t born but are made by actions taken to help others and the world they live in:\n\nA citizen\u2019s not what you are -- a citizen is what you do. A citizen cannot forget the world is more than you... So forget yourself a second. Grab a shovel or a pen. Do something for another. Don\u2019t you dare doubt that you can!\n\nThe book is said to be geared for children ages 4 to 8, but that shouldn\u2019t stop anybody from reading it to younger and older people. I imagine we all know people who could benefit from solid examples of how to be better citizens.\n\nSo what can really young kids do?\n\nEggers is the author of many books for adults and kids, including \u201cHeroes of the Frontier,\u201d \u201cThe Circle\u201d and \u201cHer Right Foot\u201d (which was also a collaboration with Harris). He is also the co-founder of \u201cVoice of Witness,\u201d an oral-history series focused on human rights, as well as 826 National, a network of writing and tutoring centers. He also co-founded ScholarMatch, which connects donors and under-resourced students who want to attend college.\n\nWhy did Eggers decide to write this book now, and why did he make it a book for kids? He wrote in an email:", "\n\nPresident Trump shakes hands with Fox News Channel's Sean Hannity during a campaign rally on Nov. 5 in Cape Girardeau, Mo. (Jeff Roberson/AP)\n\nThe Republican Party comes into Election Day with a significant handicap. The party\u2019s leader, the man in the White House, is less popular nationally coming into a midterm election than any president since 1974, save one: George W. Bush in 2006, whose popularity of four years earlier had vanished thanks to the military quagmire in Iraq.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nTrump\u2019s unpopularity has no similarly obvious external factor. There is only one obvious reason Trump is as unpopular as he is: Many Americans, especially many Democrats, simply do not like him. The percentage of Americans who hold strongly unfavorable views of Trump is generally higher than the same figure for past presidents. Part of it is the increase in partisanship in recent years, but part of it is the uniqueness of Trump.\n\nHistorically, such unpopularity is bad news for presidents' parties in midterm elections. Data from Gallup shows how presidential approval correlates to shifts in the House during midterms: The more popular the president, the better his party does. At Trump\u2019s current popularity, historic data suggests a loss of nearly 40 seats in the House \u2014 about what FiveThirtyEight\u2019s projections indicate as of writing.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nThere is something else that is broadly different about Trump, too \u2014 something that may not help in electoral politics but which provides a buffer of safety that past unpopular presidents (including, to some extent, Bush) have not enjoyed.\n\nTrump has a major media organization that\u2019s broadly treating his presidency in favorable terms \u2014 and which includes staffers whose support for Trump is explicit.\n\nFox News\u2019s Sean Hannity promised on Twitter on Monday he was headed to Missouri simply to interview Trump for his nightly opinion program on the network. What ensued, though, was anything but. Trump invited Hannity to the stage to offer some comments during the rally, a request Hannity said he was \u201chonored\u201d to grant. That the campaign had previously announced Hannity as a guest at the rally undercut Hannity\u2019s claim of objectivity in advance; his actual participation in the rally made it clearly false after the fact.\n\nBut this by itself is not new or unique. Hannity was joined onstage by Jeanine Pirro, who also hosts a show on Fox News. He\u2019d also done the interview-slash-rally participant gig before, interviewing Trump at one of his rallies, complete with feedback from the audience. He\u2019s not even the only Fox News staffer to have done that: In September, \u201cFox and Friends\u2019s\u201d Pete Hegseth interviewed Trump at a rally, the president\u2019s answers punctuated by hoots and cheers from the crowd.\n\nThe overlap between Fox News and the administration has gotten so sprawling we may forget its expanse. Trump\u2019s reported favorite to take over as U.N. ambassador following the resignation of Nikki Haley is current State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert, who was one of the anchors of \u201cFox and Friends\u201d when Trump had a regular gig calling into the show to offer his thoughts. Trump\u2019s most recent communications director is Bill Shine, a former executive at the network. (A White House pool reporter indicated that when Hannity came offstage on Monday night, Shine offered him a high five.) A number of former Fox New contributors now work for the administration: national security adviser John Bolton, Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell and communications staffer Mercedes Schlapp.\n\nTrump himself is an obviously huge fan of the network. Many days begin with his watching (and tweeting about) \u201cFox and Friends\u201d' coverage. Should he suddenly tweet about some random issue on some weekday morning, it generally does not take long for reporters like Matt Gertz to link it back to something that aired on the cable network.\n\nWhy is that relationship with Fox News so important? For one thing because it is by far the outlet most trusted by members of the Republican Party. Polling from Suffolk University makes clear how dominant Fox is among members of Trump\u2019s party.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nHannity\u2019s appearance onstage was hardly the thing that made it obvious he and his network were broadly loyal to the president and his party. We noted earlier this year Fox\u2019s coverage was generally friendlier to Trump than the other major cable news networks, barely covering the allegations raised by adult film actress Stormy Daniels but resolutely covering the migrant caravan Trump has declared central to his midterm election pitch.\n\nThe Fox News audience \u2014 averaging 2.5 million viewers in prime time earlier this year \u2014 see a different version of the world than the rest of the country. In July, we noted Trump\u2019s approval was higher among people not paying much attention to the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The best way to avoid such news, of course, was to tune in to Fox.\n\nJohn Dean, once White House counsel for former president Richard Nixon, offered an interesting thought about his former boss to Rolling Stone earlier this year. Nixon resigned from office in 1974 as the Watergate investigation engulfed him and his staff. But, Dean said, \u201cNixon might have survived if he had Fox News and the conservative media that exists today.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s unpopularity nationally is one thing, and it is likely to contribute to a poor showing by Republicans in House races this week. But his continued popularity with Republicans and the generally loyal support of the Republican base\u2019s most-watched and most-trusted network is significant. If Trump and his party have a rough night, the White House will seek to explain it away. And it is likely the resulting spin, whatever it is, will be the message carried by Hannity and Pirro and many others on the network that is most trusted by 61 percent of Republicans.\n\nWhen Trump introduced Hannity on Monday, his introduction struck directly at the truth of the relationship.\n\n\u201cI have a few people that are right out here. And they\u2019re very special. They\u2019ve done an incredible job for us. They\u2019ve been with us from the beginning,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to start by saying Sean Hannity, come on up.\u201d", "\n\nAn artist\u2019s impression of`'Oumuamua. (M. Kornmesser/European Southern Observatory) (European Southern Observatory / M. Kornmesser)\n\nFellow Americans: As you stood in line at your polling place Tuesday morning, you may have seen a headline or two claiming that the interstellar comet that visited our solar system last fall could be a spacecraft sent by an alien civilization \u2014 perhaps to deliver us from the nightmare of our political culture.\n\nI\u2019m here to report that no aliens are coming. At least, not this time.\n\nScientists have been puzzling over the cigar-shaped comet, dubbed 'Oumuamua after the Hawaiian word for \u201cmessenger,\u201d since it was first spotted swooping past the planets at an odd angle. Its speed was so blistering and trajectory so strange that scientists concluded it had to be a visitor from another star. Subsequent observations by dozens of telescopes in every wavelength of the electromagnetic spectrum suggested it was an inert (if extraordinary) space rock \u2014 dense, dustless, and reddened by irradiation from cosmic rays.\n\nJust to be on the safe side, astronomers at the Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia specifically listened for signals from any electronic device that might be attached to the object. They didn\u2019t hear a peep.\n\nBut then a preprint of a research paper to be published in the Astrophysical Journal appeared online this week, posing an \u201cexotic scenario\u201d in which the 'Oumuamua was a solar-powered probe built by an alien civilization.\n\nThere\u2019s no evidence to support this idea. Indeed, the majority of the study is devoted to examining how radiation pressure from the sun might push on a natural object and contribute to 'Oumuamua\u2019s unexplained acceleration. This phenomenon is the basis for a proposed method of spacecraft propulsion called light sails, which I guess is how we get from \u201cwhoa, weird rock\u201d to \u201cit might be aliens!\u201d The study authors justify their speculation by arguing that the probability of an ordinary comet intercepting our solar system after being ejected by its home star is very small.\n\nAs astrophysicist Katie Mack pointed out on Twitter, coming up with far-out explanations for slightly strange phenomena is one of astronomers' favorite parlor games. (Remember the alien megastructure that turned out to be a star swathed in dust?)\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean you need to stock up on canned goods and tin foil hats every time a weird theory gets published.\n\n\u201cUntil every other possibility has been exhausted dozen times over, even the authors probably don\u2019t believe it,\u201d Mack said.\n\nOther astronomers were not so forgiving of their colleagues' speculation.\n\nMy publicist asked me for a quote on the 'Oumuamua story making the rounds. Here it is:\n\n\n\n\"No, 'Oumuamua is not an alien spaceship, and the authors of the paper insult honest scientific inquiry to even suggest it.\"\n\n\n\nFeel free to use that, @fcain, @tariqjmalik! \u2014 Paul M. Sutter (@PaulMattSutter) November 6, 2018\n\nSince \u2018Oumuamua has already sped far from our solar system, out of reach of all telescopes, scientists are stuck with the data they have. Luckily, there\u2019s reams of it \u2014 and scores of more likely explanations for the comet\u2019s behavior have not been exhausted.\n\nSo, go ahead and cast your vote as if this is the only world we have, and no one else is out there to save us from ourselves.", "Election night is long \u2014 sometimes very long. Sometimes it lingers for weeks or even months. And even longtime analysts like yours truly have a difficult time processing the results of 435 House races and 33 to 35 Senate races, in real time, to figure out what it all means.\n\nOne method I\u2019ve always found helpful is to zero in on a few key races \u2014 ones that are early in the night, representative of the broader electoral battle, and/or might signal a wave for either party (in this case, the Democrats).\n\n[Where Democrats\u2019 House and Senate majority math stands, right now]\n\nHere are some of those races.\n\nIndiana Senate\n\nAs one of the two states where most polls close at 6 p.m. Eastern time (along with Kentucky), Indiana often provides early insights. And this year, there is a very close Senate race that could indicate which way control of that chamber might tilt.\n\nSen. Joe Donnelly (D) faces Republican Mike Braun in a race that has been competitive from Day One; the most recent RealClearPolitics average has Donnelly up less than a point. It also happens to be one of several very red states that Democrats were forced to defend on a tough 2018 Senate map.\n\nIf Republicans knock off Donnelly at the start of the night, it would be a huge, possible fatal blow to Democrats' majority math \u2014 and suggest other such red states could fall as the night progresses, like Missouri and Montana. Given Democrats' need to win at least one of either North Dakota, Texas or Tennessee to get the majority, and given that all of those states are tougher than Indiana, we\u2019d probably be talking about a status quo Republican majority, if not GOP gains. Losing Indiana would mean Democrats would need to win at least two of those for the majority, which is a very tall task.\n\nOn the other hand, if Donnelly wins and even exceeds expectations in a state President Trump won by 19 points, we would have to at least leave the door open for a Senate takeover.\n\nFlorida Senate\n\n\n\nSen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) holds his own election sign in Melbourne, Fla. (Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images)\n\nIt\u2019s always about Florida, and this year is no exception. Most polls close there at 7 p.m. Eastern time and the rest at 8 p.m., and while this race is obviously key to control of the Senate \u2014 Democrats almost definitely need it \u2014 it could also provide some broader clues about the election.\n\nPolling here has jumped around quite a bit, with Sen. Bill Nelson (D) starting off ahead, Gov. Rick Scott (R) seizing a lead for a while, and then Nelson reclaiming it. Nelson is up by three points right now in the RCP average.\n\nThis is the only early Senate race happening in a swing state. If Democrats can\u2019t hold a state like this, their majority math is virtually nonexistent in the Senate, and it may start to look a little dicier in the House as well. Frankly, you\u2019d expect Democrats to hold a state like this in a good year with a longtime incumbent on the ballot, even if his opponent is a sitting governor.\n\nKentucky\u2019s 6th District\n\nThis race embodies Democrats' high hopes for peeling off conservative-leaning districts thanks to strong candidates, and the suburbs turning against President Trump. Its polls also close at 6 p.m., making it the first big one where constituents are done voting.\n\nRep. Garland \u201cAndy\u201d Barr (R-Ky.) has taken at least 60 percent the last two elections, and the district was carried by Trump by 14 points and Mitt Romney by 16. But Democrats have a top-tier recruit in former Marine fighter pilot Amy McGrath, who raised a stunning $3.65 million in the third quarter of fundraising \u2014 a total usually associated with Senate candidates. It\u2019s close \u2014 so close that Donald Trump Jr. made a late appearance.\n\nIf McGrath wins, Democrats will feel like the night is progressing as they hoped, and that the majority is very possible. A Barr win wouldn\u2019t negate that possibility, but it would suggest the path becomes tougher, and maybe it\u2019s not a huge wave.\n\nGeorgia\u2019s 6th District\n\n\n\nKaren Handel, Republican candidate for Georgia's 6th Congressional District, greets diners in Tucker, Ga., last year. (David Goldman/AP)\n\nIf the above district sounds familiar, it\u2019s because it hosted the most expensive House race in history in a special election last year. Democrat Jon Ossoff came up just short, but Democrats have put it in play again.\n\nEven more so than Kentucky\u2019s 6th, it\u2019s one of those districts where the suburbs tell the tale and could buck Trump. In fact, between the 2012 and 2016 presidential races, it turned more against Trump than all but five other districts. Romney won it by 23 points, but Trump eked it out by 1.5 points.\n\nDemocrats' 2017 loss here was a heartbreaker for exactly that reason: They thought the environment and anti-Trump fervor in such districts meant they could win in previously unthinkable territory. If Democrat Lucy McBath unseats Rep. Karen Handel (R) on Tuesday, after all that disappointment, Democrats will have both the signature win that previously eluded them and a very good sign that a wave is coming.\n\nThe polls here close at 7 p.m. Eastern time.\n\nVirginia\u2019s 7th District\n\nSpeaking of districts that were previously unthinkable Democratic targets: the old one of former House majority leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) is suddenly a toss-up. Cantor\u2019s 2014 primary usurper, Rep. Dave Brat (R-Va.), is in a close race with Democrat Abigail Spanberger. This is another district that has trended away from the GOP and seemed to be pretty anti-Trump \u2014 in part because a new court-drawn map added parts of Democratic Richmond.\n\nA Democratic win here would suggest a possible House takeover, at the least. It\u2019s probably more of a race Democrats should win than the ones above, but wins in any of the three would be good news for them. Winning two of the three would be very good news.\n\nThe governors\n\nSafe Rep. Safe Dem. Likely Rep. Likely Dem. Lean Rep. Lean Dem.

Because Republicans hold a historic amount of control over state legislatures, and without Democratic wins in these key governors' races, the GOP could again draw big and important congressional maps after the 2020 Census \u2014 just like they did after 2010. Those GOP-friendly maps are a big reason Democrats aren\u2019t guaranteed a House takeover Tuesday night.\n\nI\u2019ve keyed in on six states with GOP state legislatures, malleable maps with lots of congressional districts, and a contested governor\u2019s race this year.

However, those interred in the cemetery immigrated later, coming from Morocco in the 1800s to seek economic opportunities.\n\nMany of these Jewish immigrants were men who married local Catholic women and stopped actively practicing their religion.\n\nThe burial grounds have been restored through a partnership between the local government and the Cape Verde Jewish Heritage Project, a non-for-profit founded in 2007. King Mohammed VI of Morocco financed the restoration of the cemeteries on Cape Verde, which gained independence in 1975 after more than 500 years of Portuguese rule.\n\nTwo other cemeteries, also on Cape Verde, were similarly restored in 2013 using a donation of some $100,000 from the king, Castiel said.\n\n\u201cThis is a project from a Cape Verdean Jewish organization that is supported by a Muslim country, Morocco, in a Christian country, Cape Verde,\u201d said Carlos Wahnon Veiga, Cape Verde\u2019s former prime minister and current ambassador to the United States.\n\nVeiga, who is of Jewish descent, added: \u201cIt is a very good example of tolerance worldwide.\u201d\n\nNo synagogue has ever existed on the archipelago. Yet the islands\u2019 Jewish history endured, preserved in the distinctly Sephardic surnames etched onto crumbling tombstones, sinking amid weeds and scattered trash.\n\nJanuario Nascimento, 63, a descendent of Jewish immigrants whose graves were restored on Santo Antao, is careful to keep Jewish values and stories alive for his own children even though he is not a practicing Jew.\n\nNascimento, who lives in Cape Verde\u2019s capital of Praia, plans to take his relatives to the newly rededicated graves to show them where their ancestors now lie under flat yellow stones, their story protected and celebrated for generations to come.\n\n\u201cMan has to know who he is and who his ancestors were.

That year, the CDC counted only children affected by the disease. Their average age was 7. Most had a fever or a respiratory illness a few days before developing paralysis. Many had to be placed on respirators. Although 85 percent of the children recovered partially, only three of them recovered fully.\n\nFive-year-old Braden Scott sits up unassisted at a rehab facility two months after he was struck with acute flaccid myelitis.

Are they clustered? Do they all look alike? Getting more information on these cases would be helpful.\u201d\n\nBeyond saying that confirmed cases have been reported in 17 states through July, Patel declined to reveal which states have been involved. But conversations and emails with physicians around the country indicate that at least four cases have occurred in California and at least three in Massachusetts, and that others have been seen in Florida, Texas, Pennsylvania and New York, as well as Virginia.\n\n\u201cWe are definitely hearing of cases from our colleagues across the country,\u201d said Teri Schreiner, a neurologist at the University of Colorado and Children's Hospital Colorado. \u201cIt\u2019s a trend that\u2019s worrisome \u2026 what I'm hearing from others seems to be coming at a tempo similar to what happened in 2014.\u201d\n\nJean-Baptiste Le Pichon of Children\u2019s Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, Mo., said that doctors on a U.S. email list for pediatric neurologists reported five new cases of AFM in just the past few days. \u201cThere is definitely an explosion of cases,\u201d Le Pichon said.\n\nNo treatment other than physical therapy has yet been shown to markedly improve outcomes, although some doctors have reported that treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), used to treat some other viral infectious diseases afflicting the nervous system, might help. It\u2019s also been suggested that Prozac could prove beneficial.

The 2014 outbreak of AFM occurred at the same time as a far larger outbreak of enterovirus D68 across the United States. The vast majority of patients infected with the virus developed only a respiratory illness. Some physicians were convinced that EV-D68 was the cause, not only because both outbreaks occurred at the same time but also because of a study that identified a particular strain of EV-D68 in the airways of children with AFM. But officials at the CDC and some doctors, including Wiznitzer, insist that the cause remains unproved.\n\nSo far this year, no similarly widespread outbreak of EV-D68 respiratory infections has been reported, although cases of it and other enteroviruses have been seen in some areas.\n\nOn Friday, Le Pichon, in Kansas City, said, \u201cI just got confirmation that we have an epidemic of enterovirus breaking out here and at least a few cases [of enterovirus] have typed positive for EV-D68.\u201d\n\nCarol Glaser, a pediatric infectious-disease specialist at Kaiser Permanente in Oakland, Calif., said: \u201cIf the theory is right that it\u2019s caused by EV-D68, which some of us believe more than others, this would be the time of year we start seeing it. It\u2019s an enterovirus, and they tend to peak in late summer and early fall.\u201d\n\nBecause the CDC\u2019s surveillance of AFM is less than two years old, it remains unclear if some of this year\u2019s apparent rise in confirmed cases is due simply to more doctors sending in case reports, Patel said. And Wiznitzer emphasized that with just 32 confirmed cases across the United States so far, AFM remains extremely rare\n\nGlaser, however, said she is convinced that the condition is new. She worked at the California Department of Public Health when, in 2012, some of the first reports of AFM anywhere in the country came in from physicians there.\n\n\u201cI was there for 15 years and talked to neurologists every single day,\u201d she said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until the fall of 2012 when the first physician called in and wanted a test for polio on one of his patients. One of my colleagues in the office chuckled and said to me, \u2018We don't have polio in the United States.\u2019 But in the next two weeks, I got two very similar phone calls. We had never had a report like that. I do think there was something new going on. Fortunately, it\u2019s still rare.\u201d\n\nIf EV-D68 does somehow cause AFM, studying the virus may lead to prevention or treatment. One glimmer of good news came from Kenneth Tyler, chair of neurology at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. He and his colleagues have been conducting experiments to infect mice with EV-D68 and have them develop loss of muscle control like that seen in AFM. He says he has submitted a paper to a peer-reviewed medical journal describing his success in doing so.\n\nThe goal, he said, is to use mice to study how EV-D68 causes harm to the spinal cord and muscles, and to test potential therapies, such as IVIG.\n\n\u201cIt looks like we\u2019re seeing protection with IVIG in the mouse model,\u201d he said.\n\nRobin Roberts said she wishes more was known about the condition that has harmed her son. \u201cIn this day and age to not have information about something like this is very frustrating. There needs to be more done about it, and for more parents and doctors to know about it,\u201d she said.\n\nAngie Andersen said that her daughter McKenzie was sent home from the hospital twice in the first two weeks of her illness because doctors did not understand the severity of what was happening. Finally her pediatrician told Andersen to bring McKenzie to another hospital.\n\nMcKenzie was 6 years old when she developed sniffles in December 2014. \u201cWithin 12 days,\u201d Andersen said, \u201cshe was paralyzed from the neck down, on a ventilator to breathe for her. She was left with her left hand and her feet and toes that move.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know you could understand the bad that comes from a car wreck, or if she got cancer,\u201d Andersen said. \u201cHow do you ever wrap your brain around the fact that she got a cold, and now she\u2019s a quadriplegic on a ventilator? It\u2019s a nightmare you never wake up from.\u201d\n\nStill, she said, McKenzie can now speak and even sing softly despite having a tracheotomy. \u201cShe has a lot of spunk, and that is helping her through,\u201d Andersen said.\n\nCorrection: This article originally misnamed Robin Roberts as Robin Carter.\n\n1 of 26 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 The case files: Medical mysteries View Photos From a daily afternoon fever to a debilitating reaction to chemotherapy, here\u2019s a look at perplexing medical mystery cases.

(Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP)\n\nForecasts called for brighter weather by late afternoon, but that prediction did not keep early-morning voters warm on Tuesday. A broad area of low pressure with a flanking cold front made democracy a little more taxing in the Mid-Atlantic, or at least a little more wet.\n\nThough rain tends to keep people indoors, Tuesday\u2019s weather was unlikely to significantly decrease voter turnout. Not only were the clouds predicted to part, but early reports from Washington-area polls suggested that the turnout numbers were high for a midterm election.\n\nSusan Campbell, 65, waited for nearly a half-hour in the rain to vote in Washington\u2019s Cleveland Park neighborhood. What was expected to be light showers turned into sporadic downpours as polls opened in the District. Campbell stood in line outside with her son and husband.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s our responsibility. It\u2019s our privilege,\u201d she said. \u201cHow can I possibly complain if I didn\u2019t vote?\u201d\n\nWhile the cold front inched east, south winds pushed humid air into the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic. The air was so humid in North Carolina that paper ballots were too damp to be fed through the vote-counting devices, according to the state\u2019s Board of Elections, like wrinkled dollar bills rejected from the vending machine.\n\n\u201cWhen ballots cannot be read by the tabulators, they are stored securely in \u2018emergency bins\u2019 and will be tabulated as soon as possible,\u201d the board said in a statement. \u201cAll ballots will be counted,\u201d it added.\n\nNear Richmond, 76 people were in line at the Gayton branch of the Henrico County Public Library when the polls opened at 6 a.m. By 10 a.m., with the weather waffling between fog, rain and mist, 651 voters had cast ballots and 90 more were lined up during what should have been a lull between the morning and lunchtime rush hours. The wait was 20 to 30 minutes, and the library parking lot was so packed that some voters opted to park on neighborhood streets on the other side of a busy four-lane road.\n\n[D.C.-area Election Day forecast updates]\n\nIn Northern Virginia, Jeff Stubin, an official at the Sycolin Creek Elementary School polling place in Loudoun County, said there were 150 voters per hour in the first three hours. When asked how that compared with prior years, he thought for a second and said: \u201cThat\u2019s almost presidential numbers.\u201d\n\nA 2007 study concluded that foul weather \u2014 mainly rain and snow \u2014 decreased voter turnout and benefited Republicans. For every inch of rain, turnout declined by just under 1 percent, the study found. The bad weather dissuaded Democrats the most. Results from a survey conducted by the Weather Channel before the 2012 election confirmed that finding.\n\nHowever, 37 states and the District of Columbia have implemented early voting in 2018, and millions more voters have taken advantage of that convenience than in the 2014 midterm elections. According to Michael McDonald, a political scientist at the University of Florida who also runs the United States Election Project, more than 38 million votes had been cast before Tuesday, compared with 20.5 million in 2014.\n\nThe other reason that weather probably won\u2019t affect turnout: It\u2019s not going to rain all day.\n\nIn Washington, the cold front is forecast to pass by 4 p.m., after the potential for a brief deluge and scattered thunderstorms. That would leave at least three hours of relatively dry weather in which to vote.\n\nThat should also be the case as far north as New Jersey and Upstate New York. Evening voting could be wet in New England, where the front isn\u2019t expected to pass until 9 or 10 p.m.\n\n\n\nPeople line up outside Murch Elementary School in Washington on Nov. 6, 2018, to cast their ballots.

In 2018, such disinformation is generated more by domestic users. (John Elswick/AP) (Jon Elswick/AP)\n\nFormer FBI agent Clint Watts was among the first to ring the alarm bell about Russia\u2019s audacious disinformation campaign during the 2016 U.S. election. Two years later, as voters head to the polls in another hotly contested national election, Watts has more bad news.\n\nWhen it comes to spreading lies and stoking division online, Watts said, \u201cit\u2019s Americans in 2018.\u201d\n\nSuch is the consensus among lawmakers, tech company officials and independent experts who study hate speech and related disinformation: Even as Silicon Valley has become more aggressive in battling foreign efforts to influence U.S. politics, it is losing innumerable cat-and-mouse games with Americans who are eagerly deploying the same techniques used by the Russians in 2016.\n\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s witnessed the playbook playing out,\u201d explained Watts, a fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute. \u201cNow they don\u2019t need Russia so much. They\u2019ve learned that the tactic is devastatingly effective.\u201d\n\n[West Virginians abroad in 19 countries have voted by mobile device, in the biggest blockchain-based voting test ever]\n\nHe and other experts point to a rampant online spread of misleading reports and images about the migrant caravan in Mexico, for example \u2014 and especially the demonstrably false allegations that billionaire George Soros is funding a violent \u201cinvasion\u201d of the United States.\n\nAccounts controlled by Russians probably helped amplify such misleading narratives, experts say, but the evidence so far is that they started with American political activists who are increasingly adept at online manipulation techniques but enjoy broad free-speech protections that tech companies have been reluctant to challenge.\n\nThe past few weeks, in particular, amid the buildup of political polarization ahead of Tuesday\u2019s vote have illustrated the power of social media to spread hate speech and disinformation. The man accused of shooting and killing 11 people at a Pittsburgh synagogue less than two weeks ago expressed his hostility toward Jewish people on Gab.ai, a social media site that caters to the far right, while sharing allegations about Soros that have been widely criticized as anti-Semitic.\n\n[Election Day: Control of Congress at stake as voters head to the polls]\n\nCesar Sayoc, the man charged with sending pipe bombs to CNN and prominent Democrats last month, showed signs of radicalization on Facebook and Twitter in the months before his arrest. Accounts in the name of Sayoc \u2014 or slight variations \u2014 railed against Soros while peddling conspiracy theories related to former secretary of state Hillary Clinton.\n\n\"I think the scale and scope of domestic disinformation is much larger than any foreign influence operation,\u201d said Graham Brookie, director of the Atlantic Council\u2019s Digital Forensic Research Lab. \u201cAnd I also think that as a society, as a nation, it\u2019s much harder for us to have coherent self-reflection on that, and you see that play out in real time.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Facebook announced it had removed 30 accounts from the site \u2014 and another 85 on Instagram, which it owns \u2014 that \u201cmay be engaged in coordinated inauthentic behavior.\u201d Facebook did not attribute the accounts to any particular foreign government but noted that many Facebook pages tied to the accounts were in Russian or French, while many Instagram accounts used English. Facebook did say that it had received reports from U.S. law enforcement that \u201cmay be linked to foreign entities.\u201d\n\n[Without evidence, Trump and Sessions warn of voter fraud in Tuesday\u2019s elections]\n\nBut Facebook\u2019s head of cybersecurity policy, Nathaniel Gleicher, said in a visit to Washington last month that the bigger challenge remains detecting and policing the many Americans spreading disinformation.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re talking about volume, the majority of the volume we see is domestic. And that doesn\u2019t just mean in the United States; it means around the world,\u201d Gleicher said. \u201cIt makes perfect sense when you think about it, because in order to run an information operation, the most important thing is that you understand the culture that you\u2019re targeting. And there are always going to be more people inside a culture that can do that than outside.\u201d\n\nThis observation is borne out by new research from Harvard\u2019s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy and Oxford University\u2019s Computational Propaganda Project. The Harvard researchers said Monday that they had seen major spikes in outright fabrication and misleading information proliferating online over the past six months, with people using warlike rhetoric in social media posts to spread anti-immigrant sentiment. A \u201csignificant portion\u201d of the disinformation appeared to come from Americans, not foreigners, the Harvard researchers said.\n\nThe Oxford researchers, meanwhile, reported last week that misleading and polarizing news reports were spreading more widely on social media in the 2018 election season than two years ago. The disinformation also is reaching a broader audience, outpacing the spread of authentic reports from mainstream, \u201cprofessional\u201d news organizations, the researchers said.\n\nTech companies \u201chave done a good job tracking and blocking foreign origin stuff \u2014 content that originates from Russia, Iran or [the Islamic State],\u201d Oxford researcher Phil Howard said. \u201cThey have done much less to combat homegrown English language misinformation.\u201d\n\nSince the 2016 election, Facebook, Google and Twitter have hired more staff and coded more powerful algorithms to thwart disinformation spread by foreign or domestic actors online. The tech giants also have been more aggressive at taking down fake accounts, while tightening policies against the kind of content \u2014 including hate speech and efforts at voter suppression \u2014 that they\u2019re willing to tolerate on their platforms.\n\nFacebook declined to comment, while Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nTwitter emphasized its work to combat networks of automated accounts, known as bots, and tweets that seek to mislead users about how, when and where to vote. \u201cAttempts to game our systems or to spread deliberately malicious election content will be removed from Twitter \u2014 whether they are foreign or domestic in origin,\u201d Carlos Monje, the company\u2019s director of public policy and philanthropy in the Unite States and Canada, said in a statement.\n\nDomestic disinformation and hate speech are hardly new, but concerns about Russian interference so dominated the political debate since the 2016 vote that the role of Americans drew less attention in scholarly reports, congressional hearings and news coverage.\n\nForeign influence operations in 2018 have appeared more sophisticated as Facebook, Twitter and other social media platforms have discovered and purged accounts operating from Russia and Iran.\n\nFacebook shut down more than 800 apparently domestic accounts and publishers in October for violating its policies prohibiting spam. But that action generated yet another round of allegations that Silicon Valley was curbing the free speech rights of conservatives, an issue that has become a political problem for social media companies.\n\nThe First Amendment protects Americans from government censorship, not corporate decisions about what content to allow on technology platforms. Yet there have been bipartisan demands that Silicon Valley act as a protector of political speech in all but the most egregious cases.\n\nThere is little consensus, however, on what qualifies as egregious beyond hate speech, child pornography and calls for violence. Tech companies have vigorously resisted being cast as \u201carbiters of truth,\u201d even as they have tried to crack down on the worst cases of disinformation by establishing partnerships with third-party fact-checkers and hiring thousands of new content moderators. Facebook has heavily publicized a \u201cwar room\u201d at its Menlo Park, Calif., headquarters to signal its seriousness in dealing with such issues.\n\nYet now, with the arrival of Election Day, there is consensus among outside experts that technology companies are still losing the fight against politically charged hate speech and disinformation. Lawmakers are expressing, yet again, frustration that the tech companies haven\u2019t done more to protect Americans from the untruths, conspiracy theories and hateful language that spreads so efficiently on social media.\n\n\u201cI think there is a growing sense that a lack of any moral or legal responsibility about [spreading] hate or violence just doesn\u2019t cut it,\u201d said Sen. Mark R. Warner (Va.), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee.\n\nSocial media researcher Jonathan Albright has published a series of essays on Medium in recent days detailing the extent of the problem, calling disinformation in 2018 more widespread and serious than in 2016.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re even more behind,\u201d Albright said in an interview. \u201cThe number of people trying to game the system has increased.\u201d\n\nAnd most of them, he added, are Americans.\n\nElizabeth Dwoskin and Andrew Ba Tran contributed to this report.", "Opinion writer\n\nThere are Freudian slips, and then there\u2019s this:\n\nAfter weeks of Republicans claiming that they\u2019re the ones who truly want to protect people with preexisting conditions despite having spent the past eight years fighting furiously to eliminate those protections, the health-care mendacity reaches its apotheosis with President Trump claiming that Democrats have a nefarious plan to eliminate Obamacare, which he and Republicans will save.\n\nYes, it\u2019s amusing. But it actually highlights an interesting question: What exactly are Republicans going to do about health care, and the Affordable Care Act in particular, after the election is over?\n\nThe easy answer is that they\u2019ll try to repeal it again, which Mitch McConnell has said they will do. But the real answer is more complicated, since it involves multiple forces and constraints operating at the same time. And it all may wind up in a dramatic ruling from the Supreme Court, in which Chief Justice John Roberts could once again step in to save the GOP from itself.\n\nYou\u2019ve probably heard about the lawsuit in a federal court in Texas, filed by 19 Republican-run states and supported by the Trump administration, that seeks to strike down the entire Affordable Care Act. The suit claims that because the Republican Congress reduced the penalty for not carrying insurance (the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d) to $0, the mandate has effectively been eliminated and therefore the entire law, including popular provisions such as the protection for people with preexisting conditions, the expansion of Medicaid, the subsidies to help people afford coverage, and allowing young people to stay on their parents\u2019 insurance up to age 26, must be declared invalid.\n\nAs the election approached and Democrats began hammering them on preexisting conditions, Republicans suddenly realized what a liability the lawsuit was. Their reaction was simply to lie about their intentions. This brought us the spectacle of people like Josh Hawley, the attorney general of Missouri and a party to the lawsuit, airing soft-focus ads in his campaign for Senate about how deeply committed he is to protecting those with preexisting conditions when his own lawsuit would strip the ACA\u2019s protections away. Then there\u2019s Martha McSally, another GOP Senate candidate, who claims she\u2019s \u201cleading the fight\u201d to \u201cforce insurance companies to cover preexisting conditions\u201d when they\u2019re already forced to do that and she\u2019s fighting to make it so they will no longer be forced to.\n\nYou can tell they\u2019re torn. On one hand, they\u2019ve spent all these years arguing that the ACA is a vile abomination, a law so horrific in its statist oppression that it could have been dug out of Joe Stalin\u2019s diaries. On the other hand, Americans really like almost everything the ACA does. So Republicans desperately want to kill it, but just as desperately don\u2019t want the public to know they killed it.\n\nAs Stephanie Mencimer of Mother Jones reminds us, the judge in the GOP lawsuit, Reed O\u2019Connor, has been sitting on his ruling for months. And he\u2019s no ordinary judge. Appointed by George W. Bush, he\u2019s such a reliable conservative that Republicans regularly file suits in his district, including this one, specifically so they\u2019ll be assigned to O\u2019Connor and he can rule in their favor:\n\nTim Jost, a professor emeritus at Washington and Lee University School of Law and an expert on the ACA who is following the litigation, calls O\u2019Connor \u201can intensely political judge\u201d who indicated strong opinions against the ACA during the September hearing. \u201cWhy hasn\u2019t he ruled yet?\u201d asks Jost. \u201cI suspect that he is waiting until the election is over because the last thing Republican candidates need right now is another reminder that they are trying to get rid of preexisting-conditions protections.\u201d\n\nSo what will happen once the election is behind us? Here\u2019s how it might go. O\u2019Connor would issue a ruling declaring the entire ACA invalid. There would be an immediate appeal, and given the upheaval that would be caused by such a consequential law being snuffed out, the appeals court would likely stay the ruling until the case could be resolved. Eventually it would be heard by the Supreme Court. And what then?\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to know for sure, but I think there\u2019s a strong chance that Roberts would save the law, not because he\u2019s some kind of traitor to conservatism but for two other reasons. First, in his public comments Roberts has made clear his concern for the court\u2019s legitimacy, and he realizes that its legitimacy is undermined when it appears to be nothing more than an arm of one party, striking down any law that party doesn\u2019t like. And that legitimacy has seldom been more threatened than it is right now. Second, Roberts understands when his party has gone off the rails and needs to be protected from its own worst instincts.\n\nSupreme Court watchers will tell you that while Clarence Thomas is the most purely conservative justice on the court, Samuel Alito is the most partisan (at least until Brett Kavanaugh took his seat). But make no mistake: Roberts is a partisan, too, just in a different way. Instead of asking \u201cWhat does the Republican Party want from this case?\u201d the question he seems to ask is more like, \u201cWhat\u2019s in the long-term interests of the Republican Party?,\u201d which is a very different question.\n\nRoberts twice ruled against Republican lawsuits seeking to destroy the ACA, in 2012 and then again in 2015. Both suits were absurd on their face. But as we all know by now, when it comes to a politically charged question like this one, the actual merits of a case are almost irrelevant; what matters is the outcome the justices want to reach.\n\nWhile many conservatives cried that he was a traitor for siding with the liberals in those rulings (he was joined by Anthony Kennedy in the latter), I think he was playing a longer game. Roberts may have seen nothing but trouble for the GOP and the conservative project if the ACA were struck down by the court. There would be an inevitable backlash, one that would do huge damage to the party and could result in the passage of universal health coverage, even a single-payer program. Better to live with the ACA (and let it be undermined and sabotaged by Republican administrations, as the current one is doing) than risk something that from a Republican perspective would be far worse both politically and substantively.\n\nJust imagine what would happen if the court struck down the ACA. It would be an absolute cataclysm. Tens of millions of people would lose their coverage. Protection for preexisting conditions? Gone. Democrats would decide that there\u2019s no point in advocating anything less than full-on universal coverage, probably in the form of Medicare-for-all, and in the wreckage Republicans made of the health-care system, the public would welcome it with open arms.\n\nRoberts is smart enough to understand this. And when he watches the president warn darkly that if Democrats take over they\u2019ll obliterate Obamacare, he probably shakes his head and says, \u201cI guess it\u2019s up to me to bail these bozos out. Again.\u201d\n\nI could be wrong, of course. Maybe Roberts will join with the other four conservatives to finally drive a stake through the ACA\u2019s heart. But I suspect that he understands, even if many of his Republican brethren don\u2019t, that in the long run doing so would be the greatest gift advocates of universal coverage could ever get. So he\u2019ll side with the liberals, not because he\u2019s not a true Republican, but precisely because he is.\n\nRead more:\n\nWhat can we expect from the midterms?

(Leon Kuegeler/Reuters)\n\nBarring any injuries this week, the U.S. men\u2019s national soccer team will enter its final activities of the year with four young cornerstones together in training camp for the first time.\n\nIn naming a 28-man roster for friendlies against England and Italy, interim coach Dave Sarachan included Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie, Tim Weah and Tyler Adams. They all are fixtures in the program\u2019s long-term rebuilding plans but have never been part of the same squad. On three occasions, three were on the field together.\n\nPulisic, 20, is the most accomplished of the quartet, having featured prominently since 2016. But he has appeared in just one U.S. match this year (May 28 vs. Bolivia) because of injuries, a summer break and club demands with Bundesliga leader Borussia Dortmund.\n\nMcKennie, 20, will arrive from German side Schalke, and Weah, 18, from French power Paris Saint-Germain. All three are with clubs in the UEFA Champions League, though Weah has had a hard time earning time on a star-studded roster.\n\nAdams, 19, is a rising star with the New York Red Bulls, who won the Supporters' Shield (most regular season points) in MLS this season.\n\n[Former USMNT defender Cherundolo joins coaching staff for England and Italy friendlies]\n\nThe squad also includes German-based forward Josh Sargent, 18, who scored against Peru last month.\n\nThe Americans will begin workouts Monday in London ahead of games against England on Nov. 15 at Wembley Stadium and Italy on Nov. 20 in Genk, Belgium.\n\nThe chosen players have an average age of 23 years 241 days, and 13 caps. Seventeen players are 23 or younger, while 18 players have earned 10 caps or fewer.\n\n\u201cThese last two matches provide a fantastic set of challenges and experiences,\u201d said Sarachan, who has a 3-3-4 record since last fall. \u201cSo we\u2019re excited to bring in this group of players for another huge opportunity.\u201d\n\nIn probably his final act before the U.S. Soccer Federation names a permanent coach, Sarachan summoned an unusually large number of players because of scheduling conflicts with the MLS playoffs. Six domestic-based players, including Adams, are employed by teams with playoff matches Sunday, which prevents them from training with the U.S. team until next Tuesday, just two days before the England game.\n\nThe others are goalkeepers Brad Guzan (Atlanta) and Zack Steffen (Columbus); defender Aaron Long (Red Bulls); and midfielders Darlington Nagbe (Atlanta) and Wil Trapp (Columbus). Defender Jorge Villafana remains active in the playoffs, but his club (Portland) plays Thursday instead of Sunday.\n\nIf their teams advance, none would miss any future games because MLS will go dark during the international window.\n\nOn the decision to invite players who might still be involved in the playoffs after this weekend, Sarachan said: \u201cThese are important matches, and we only have so many opportunities every year to bring our players together. . . . You want to include players you feel are vital to your program.\u201d\n\nAll but one of Sarachan\u2019s selections have participated in previous U.S. camps. The newcomer is Romain Gall, a 23-year-old attacking midfielder with Swedish club Malmo. Five players from the October camp were not invited: defender Ben Sweat, midfielders Jonathan Amon and Michael Bradley, and forwards Andrija Novakovich (injured) and Fafa Picault.\n\nIn leaving off Bradley, who was part of last month\u2019s setup, Sarachan said: \u201cHis need for these games is far less important than it would be for players with less experience. Secondly, Michael\u2019s schedule the past two years with Toronto FC has been virtually nonstop, and he has largely played without a break. At this stage, it made sense to give him some extra time off and also allow these games to be a platform for players that lack that kind of experience.\u201d\n\nU.S. roster\n\nGoalkeepers: Brad Guzan (Atlanta United), Ethan Horvath (Club Brugge), Zack Steffen (Columbus Crew).\n\nDefenders: John Brooks (Wolfsburg), Reggie Cannon (FC Dallas), Cameron Carter-Vickers (Swansea City), Aaron Long (New York Red Bulls), Matt Miazga (Nantes), Shaq Moore (Reus Deportiu), Antonee Robinson (Wigan), Jorge Villafana (Portland Timbers), DeAndre Yedlin (Newcastle), Walker Zimmerman (Los Angeles FC).\n\nMidfielders: Kellyn Acosta (Colorado Rapids), Tyler Adams (New York Red Bulls), Luca de la Torre (Fulham), Marky Delgado (Toronto FC), Romain Gall (Malmo), Julian Green (Greuther Fuerth), Sebastian Lletget (Los Angeles Galaxy), Weston McKennie (Schalke), Darlington Nagbe (Atlanta United), Christian Pulisic (Borussia Dortmund), Kenny Saief (Anderlecht), Wil Trapp (Columbus Crew), Tim Weah (Paris Saint-Germain).\n\nForwards: Josh Sargent (Werder Bremen), Bobby Wood (Hannover).\n\nRead more soccer coverage:\n\nGeorgetown is a No. 1 seed in NCAA women\u2019s soccer tournament\n\nHow 139 American soccer players abroad fared this weekend", "\n\nMark Ingram's Saints had the weekend's top win. (Chuck Cook/USA Today Sports)\n\nEach week, national NFL writer Mark Maske ranks the league\u2019s 32 teams. There\u2019s a change at the top and a change at the bottom this week, after the Saints knocked the Rams from the ranks of the unbeaten, and the Raiders lost in dreadful fashion to the 49ers.\n\n1. New Orleans Saints (7-1) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 2\n\nThe Saints move up to No. 1 on the strength of their pulsating victory Sunday in New Orleans over the previously unbeaten Rams. It was offensive football at its finest, and in the end, the Saints had a little too much of Drew Brees, Michael Thomas and Alvin Kamara for the Rams to handle. But about that stashed-flip-phone TD celebration by Thomas: Paying homage to Joe Horn is great, but next time, maybe wait until the outcome of the game is no longer in doubt.\n\n2. New England Patriots (7-2) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 3\n\nTom Brady actually seemed confused at times Sunday night by the looks given to him by the Green Bay defense, but he figured out a way to win. Isn\u2019t that how it always goes with Brady and the Patriots? This is resembling another one of those seasons in which a 1-2 start for New England gives way to a Super Bowl appearance.\n\n[People apparently like to watch Tom Brady play Aaron Rodgers on TV]\n\n3. Kansas City Chiefs (8-1) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 4\n\nPatrick Mahomes and the Chiefs took care of business Sunday in Cleveland and now have a tuneup against the Cardinals before their Nov. 19 meeting with the Rams in Mexico City.\n\n4. Los Angeles Rams (8-1) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 1\n\nThe loss in New Orleans is significant only if the Rams must go back there for the NFC title game. The burden of chasing a 19-0 season was something they didn\u2019t need anyway. The bigger issue is the defense. This was constructed to be a superteam, not just a super-on-offense team. Yes, this is a season in which it\u2019s difficult to play defense well. And, yes, that was Drew Brees and the Saints. But this defense is supposed to be better than that. Far better. Coordinator Wade Phillips needs to figure some things out.\n\n[At the NFL\u2019s midpoint, there are these four teams, and then there\u2019s everybody else]\n\n5. Los Angeles Chargers (6-2) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 5\n\nThe Chargers are still the second-best NFL team in L.A. But the gap between the two is not all that wide.\n\n6. Pittsburgh Steelers (5-2-1) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 6\n\nThe four straight 100-yard rushing games by James Conner and the four straight wins have made it easy for the Steelers to stop fretting about when or whether Le\u2019Veon Bell will show up. If he does, fine. Work him into the lineup and use him as a complementary player. If not, fine. Keep handing the ball to Conner. The Steelers have little time to savor Sunday\u2019s win in Baltimore with a Thursday night meeting with the Panthers at hand.\n\n[Steelers continue \u2018Le\u2019Veon who?\u2019 portion of season with a critical win over Ravens]\n\n7. Carolina Panthers (6-2) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 8\n\nThe Panthers are an interesting team, but are they an actual postseason threat to the Saints or Rams in the NFC? Their December meetings with the Saints could be telling.\n\n8. Houston Texans (6-3) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 10\n\nThe Texans were fortunate in Denver with the missed field goal by the Broncos\u2019 Brandon McManus that would have been the game-winner. But good luck is part of it when things are going well. And they are going very well for the Texans, with six straight wins and their bye week at hand.\n\n\n\nBrandon McManus's missed field goal for the Broncos gave the Texans their sixth straight win. (David Zalubowski/Associated Press)\n\n9. Philadelphia Eagles (4-4) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 9\n\nThe Redskins\u2019 vulnerability means the NFC East is there for the taking for the Eagles, even with their early-season inconsistencies. But they need to play far better than they did in the first half of the season. They host the Cowboys on Sunday night in what becomes almost a must-win for them, given that their following game is at New Orleans and they still have a December road game against the Rams.\n\n10. Chicago Bears (5-3) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 12\n\nEven after the Khalil Mack trade, few figured the Bears would lead the NFC North at the halfway point of their season, not with the Vikings and Packers once looking so formidable. But there\u2019s no reason that the Bears can\u2019t win this division.\n\n11. Minnesota Vikings (5-3-1) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 13\n\nSuddenly, there\u2019s a lot to like about the way the Vikings are playing. Their triumph Sunday over the Lions didn\u2019t require big passing numbers by Kirk Cousins. Maybe, just maybe, this team still can become what it was expected to be.\n\n12. Cincinnati Bengals (5-3) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 11\n\nThe Bengals, as they return from their bye, reportedly will play without WR A.J. Green for at least two games. But his injured toe won\u2019t require surgery, a welcome development for the Bengals because their offense absolutely has to have him.\n\n13. Atlanta Falcons (4-4) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 18\n\nThe Falcons have reassembled their once-broken season with three straight wins following a 1-4 start. The victory Sunday over the Redskins at FedEx Field was impressive. But there are two excellent teams ahead of the Falcons in the NFC South: the Saints and Panthers. Getting to the playoffs remains a long shot, but at least it\u2019s not a no-shot any longer.\n\n\n\nMatt Ryan had a big day as the Falcons handed the Redskins a lopsided defeat. (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)\n\n14. Washington Redskins (5-3) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 7\n\nJust when it seemed like it was time to begin trusting the Redskins as a legitimate playoff contender, they gave a dud of a performance against the Falcons that was made even worse by the season-ending injuries suffered by WR Paul Richardson Jr. and Gs Brandon Scherff and Shawn Lauvao. The defense remains formidable, even after being shredded by Matt Ryan and the Falcons. But the offense is reaching the point of being nonfunctional, especially given the depleted state of the offensive line.\n\n15. Miami Dolphins (5-4) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 21\n\nIt does not appear that Ryan Tannehill is ready to return to the lineup. That\u2019s not the worst thing. Brock Osweiler has not been all that awful as the fill-in starter at QB. And the Dolphins somehow are hanging around as playoff contenders.\n\n16. Tennessee Titans (4-4) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 25\n\nThe Titans got off to a shaky, turnover-marred start Monday night in Dallas. But QB Marcus Mariota and the offense settled down. The defense was very good, and the Titans emerged with a road victory that they sorely needed.\n\n17. Green Bay Packers (3-4-1) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 14\n\nThe Packers had some bad luck against the Patriots, with injuries and the questionable ejection of S Jermaine Whitehead. But their worst break was again self-inflicted: the fumble by Aaron Jones when Green Bay was driving toward a fourth-quarter lead. Being competitive against the Rams and Patriots in back-to-back road games but losing should provide no comfort to the Packers. This is a results league, and the Packers\u2019 inability to support Aaron Rodgers in close games has left their season unraveling.\n\n[Aaron Rodgers did all he could but Tom Brady won. Did anyone expect anything different?]\n\n18. Seattle Seahawks (4-4) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 15\n\nThe Seahawks, in this season of transition, have overachieved even to be at .500. It would be surprising to see them hold things together in the coming weeks, coming off Sunday\u2019s loss to the Chargers and with the Rams, Packers and Panthers up next.\n\n19. Baltimore Ravens (4-5) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 16\n\nThere\u2019s little sense in firing John Harbaugh or benching Joe Flacco in favor of rookie Lamar Jackson. The Ravens\u2019 best chance for a turnaround is with Harbaugh as their coach and Flacco as their QB. It\u2019s not a good chance, not with the way things are going, but it\u2019s better than the chance the Ravens would have with an interim coach and a rookie QB. Leave the big changes until after the season if they miss the playoffs again.\n\n[Feinstein: The Ravens are reeling, and they have themselves to blame]\n\n20. Indianapolis Colts (3-5) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 19\n\nThe Colts return from their bye to play home games against the Jaguars, Titans and Dolphins. They\u2019re on a two-game winning streak, and they have a chance to continue to progress toward respectability.\n\n21. Dallas Cowboys (3-5) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 17\n\nThe addition of WR Amari Cooper helped a little bit Monday night, but not nearly enough. The Cowboys couldn\u2019t take advantage of their opportunities. The defense couldn\u2019t keep the Titans in check. Dallas is simply a poor team halfway through its season. It makes no difference how wide-open the NFC East is if you can\u2019t win any games.\n\n22. Jacksonville Jaguars (3-5) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 24\n\nIt\u2019s now or never for the Jaguars, who return from their bye to play three of their next four games against the Colts and Bills. There\u2019s also a home game against the Steelers during that four-game stretch. If the Jaguars can\u2019t go at least 3-1, feel free to count them out.\n\n23. Detroit Lions (3-5) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 20\n\nWhen they traded WR Golden Tate, the Lions said they weren\u2019t giving up on their season. But their performance in Sunday\u2019s loss at Minnesota looked like that of a team that has given up on its season. That matters much more than what was said.\n\n\n\nHow much longer will the Fitzmagic continue? (Nell Redmond/Associated Press)\n\n24. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (3-5) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 22\n\nAll of this Ryan Fitzpatrick stuff is entertaining to watch. He certainly makes things interesting, and he remains the starter at QB for now. But eventually, the Bucs need to go back to Jameis Winston so they can make a fully informed decision about his future with the franchise.\n\n25. Denver Broncos (3-6) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 23\n\nNothing is going the Broncos\u2019 way, and front-office executive John Elway is being asked about the possibility of an in-season coaching change. Elway is sticking with Vance Joseph for now, but Joseph\u2019s hold on his job is looking increasingly tenuous.\n\n26. Arizona Cardinals (2-6) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 26\n\nThe Cardinals became the most recent contributor to the Sam Bradford Fund before becoming the latest team to part ways with him.\n\n27. New York Jets (3-6) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 27\n\nNo, Sam Darnold is not playing well at all. The four-interception performance against the Dolphins was horrendous. But the Jets absolutely should not sit him. This is part of the deal when you commit to a rookie QB.\n\n28. San Francisco 49ers (2-7) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 32\n\nNick Mullens? Seriously? Okay, it was only against the Raiders. But having a better 49ers debut than Joe Montana or Steve Young is something, no matter how sorry the competition. The Niners should stick with him as their starter. There\u2019s no reason not to do so in a lost season, and with Jimmy Garoppolo done for the year.\n\n29. Cleveland Browns (2-6-1) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 28\n\nMaybe the Browns' performance against the Chiefs in Gregg Williams\u2019s first game as interim coach will lead to him getting four more secret head coaching offers.\n\n30. Buffalo Bills (2-7) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 29\n\nAll you need to know about Nathan Peterman is that throwing three interceptions and having a 45.4 passer rating against the Bears qualified as a decent outing by his standards.\n\n31.

(Stephanie Keith/Getty Images)\n\nWarriors Coach Steve Kerr, members of the NFL Players Coalition and former NBA MVP Stephen Curry agree: This year, voting feels different. It\u2019s more than just a nuisance or chore, something you automatically do when you come of age, as Kerr put it. And it\u2019s something, they all argued this week, intrinsically connected to healing the country\u2019s divisions,\n\n\u201cRight now, our collective national identity is one of pain and despair, of confusion and anger. We are fractured, we are hurting and too many are finding themselves as mourners,\u201d NFL players Kelvin Beachum, Matt Forte, Chris Long and Josh Norman wrote on the Players Tribune. \"But America\u2019s true identity is one of greatness. We may have deep scars, but from times of darkness we have emerged as a nation with the courage to protect our neighbor from harm and the willingness to insist on our shared values of hope, of inclusion, of community. We have always stood up for each other. We have always been able to reclaim our identity.\n\n\"On November 6, we can return to that place. We can raise our voice and remind our officials and each other that we are more than the hate we have seen. With our vote, we can say that we believe in and are committed to the happiness, the health and the lives of all Americans. We can tell the world that we are a country worthy of our reputation as the world\u2019s greatest nation.\n\n\u201cThis is what is at stake with your vote.\u201d\n\n[In the NFL, the gap between the haves and have-nots is growing wider]\n\nKerr echoed that in an essay of his own.\n\n\u201cVoting feels more important than ever. When I sent in my ballot recently \u2014 by mail to my home city of San Diego \u2014 I did so with a heavy heart,\u201d Kerr said in an as-told-to essay on SI.com. \u201cI love this country and have lived here most of my life. But, like many on both sides of the aisle, I don\u2019t like what\u2019s happening to it right now. I don\u2019t like the direction we\u2019re heading. And I can\u2019t stand the political climate that\u2019s been created.\u201d\n\nKerr, as he often has in recent months, mentioned his particular interest in gun regulation, which he called his \u201cflashpoint topic.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be yours. And that\u2019s the message I hope to pass along: As long as there\u2019s at least one issue you care about \u2014 campaign finance reform, climate change, healthcare, taxes, immigration \u2014 you have a reason to vote,\u201d he said in the essay. \"I\u2019ve read that over 100 million Americans plan on skipping the polls on Tuesday. That\u2019s their right. But if you don\u2019t vote, then you can\u2019t complain.\n\n\u201cSo if you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed, focus just on the issues that matter to you. Do some research and make an informed decision. It is the least we can do, considering people fought, and in many cases gave their lives, for our right to do this.\u201d\n\nThe issue of gun regulation has been especially personal for Kerr, whose father was shot and killed in Beirut in 1984.\n\n\u201cYou can scare the hell out of people by voting,\u201d he told a Newark town hall just before the March for Our Lives that followed the shooting in Florida\u2019s Marjory Stoneman Douglas school. \u201cYou can inspire others to vote. Get registered.\u201d\n\nCurry, meanwhile, used the Golden State Warriors\u2019 election-eve game to send the two-pronged message that he and Kerr have been delivering about voting and gun control by turning out for his postgame news conference Monday in a black T-shirt with the words \u201cMarch for Our Lives\u201d emblazoned in small letters across the front. It\u2019s a message that groups dedicated to voter turnout have used with their \u201cVote for Our Lives\u201d message.\n\n\u201cObviously, I understand what [Tuesday] means in terms of how important it is to vote,\u201d Curry told reporters after the Warriors' victory, \u201cspecifically around candidates and people who are running for office that are protective for gun control and things like that.\n\n\"I\u2019ve got to continue to raise awareness in any way that I can. I think this saying kind of speaks for itself in terms of what [Tuesday] means all across our country.\u201d\n\nSteph wearing a sweatshirt that says \u201cI am a voter.\u201d pic.twitter.com/6V0ntBhzUG \u2014 Warriors on NBCS (@NBCSWarriors) November 3, 2018\n\nKerr also offered a message to the \u201cstick to sports\u201d crowd.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re wondering why a basketball coach is talking to you about this, that\u2019s fair. I know, stick to sports, shut up and dribble and all that,\u201d he said in the Sports Illustrated piece. \"But I\u2019m not writing this as a coach.

The mission had put the United States ahead of the Soviet Union in a race to space. America plans to return to the moon as part of a new mission. (NASA via AP)\n\nO n May 25, 1961, President John Kennedy issued a challenge to lawmakers, the new U.S. space agency and the American people.\n\n\u201cI believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the Earth,\u201d Kennedy said in a speech before Congress.\n\nIt was an ambitious goal. But in July 1969, NASA would achieve it. Apollo 11 \u2014 with Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin aboard \u2014 landed on the lunar surface and made it back to Earth. This moonshot was no one-shot deal. Astronauts returned to the moon five times for further exploration.\n\nNASA announced this summer that it plans to head back there in the 2020s, about 50 years after astronauts last visited. But this time, the moon isn\u2019t considered a destination. It\u2019s a pit stop on the way to the next space goal: sending humans to Mars. To understand this new era of human spaceflight, it\u2019s important to look back at what Kennedy set in motion 57 years ago.\n\n\n\nEdwin \u201cBuzz\u201d Aldrin stands near the American flag that he and Neil Armstrong planted on the moon during the first moon landing in July 1969.

(NASA via AP)\n\nA proving ground\n\nWhen Kennedy made his plea to Congress, the United States had just launched its first manned spacecraft. Alan Shepard made a 15-minute suborbital flight, traveling 115 miles up and then returning to Earth. The Soviet Union had sent the first man into space several weeks earlier. Not only had Yuri Gagarin\u2019s flight lasted longer \u2014 108 minutes \u2014 but he also completed a single orbit of the Earth. The United States was embarrassed. It didn\u2019t want the Soviets \u2014 the only other world superpower at the time \u2014 to get ahead in space exploration.\n\n\u201cThere was this battle for hearts and minds,\u201d says Teasel Muir-Harmony, space history curator at the Smithsonian National Air & Space Museum. \u201cBeating the Soviets in space was important for the United States\u2019 place in the world.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe footprint of the first man on the moon. (NASA via AP)\n\nThe president had talked with NASA scientists about which achievement was within reach for the United States and perhaps further away for the Soviets.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. at the time was better at landings,\u201d Muir-Harmony said. \u201cThe Soviet Union at the time was having trouble with landings.\u201d\n\nSo they chose landing on the moon, which is on average 240,000 miles away. (The distance changes because its orbit is not a circle.) At that point, Gagarin had traveled the farthest from Earth \u2014 203 miles. Muir-Harmony said Kennedy purposely chose not to aim just one step ahead of the Soviets.\n\n\u201cIf we propose this program that\u2019s really bold . . . they\u2019d have to invest in new technologies,\u201d Muir-Harmony said. Members of Congress would debate spending nearly $1.7 billion on the space program for the next year.\n\nThat money and billions more approved in the 1960s paid not only for the Apollo missions but also rockets and other technology that NASA has used in the decades since then. That, too, was part of Kennedy\u2019s pitch to Congress.\n\n\u201cThis gives promise of some day providing a means for even more exciting and ambitious exploration of space, perhaps beyond the moon, perhaps to the very end of the solar system itself,\u201d he said.\n\nBack and forward\n\nNASA has sent spacecraft to explore the far reaches of our solar system and beyond, but none has included humans. Instead, astronauts have been studying the effects of living and working in space by orbiting Earth, first on Skylab and since 2000 on the International Space Station (ISS).\n\nThe missions have become more collaborative than competitive. NASA has four international partners: space agencies in Russia, Canada, Japan and Europe. More than 100 astronauts and cosmonauts have stayed on the ISS for long-term assignments. And private companies have partnered with NASA to take supplies to the station. Two companies, Boeing and SpaceX, are set to next year become the first private companies to ferry astronauts to the ISS.\n\n\n\nAstronaut Sunita \u201cSuni\u201d Williams trains April 3 in a mock-up of SpaceX\u2019s Crew Dragon spacecraft in Hawthorne, California. SpaceX and Boeing are private companies that have partnered with NASA to ferry astronauts to the International Space Station beginning next year. (SpaceX)\n\nNASA aims to work with these partners and others as it moves toward human missions to Mars. The agency\u2019s leader, Jim Bridenstine, explained in September that the plan to get to Mars involves returning to the moon with landers, rovers, robots and humans.\n\n\u201cThe glory of the moon is that\u2019s it\u2019s only a three-day journey home,\u201d Bridenstine told members of Congress. \u201cSo we can prove all of the technologies, we can reduce all of the risks.\u201d\n\nAnd in the event of an emergency, NASA can get astronauts home quickly, he said. The journey from Mars, which is on average 140 million miles from Earth, would take about eight months.\n\n\n\nChris Ferguson, a former NASA astronaut who now works for Boeing, and Williams practice an emergency escape from the crew access tower at Kennedy Space Center in June.

Eventually it would serve as a launchpad to Mars.\n\n[Meet NASA engineer Molly White, who works on Orion]\n\nThese moon missions will be similar to Apollo in that the United States wants to prove its leadership in space exploration.

(Amanda Voisard/Austin American-Statesman/AP)\n\nOpinion writer\n\n\u201cThe midterm elections are a referendum on the vision of America that Donald Trump, through deed and even more so through word, has advanced since he descended that infamous escalator in Trump Tower,\u201d writes Yascha Mounk, an expert on the rise of illiberal democracies. \u201cThis vision pits the native born against the newly arrived. It prioritizes the white and Christian over the black or Muslim. And it envisages the United States as a nation whose interests perpetually require it to enter into conflict with other countries, including not only recent foes but also old allies, rather than the linchpin of a system of alliances designed to maintain peace and prosperity both at home and abroad.\u201d I would add that it pits nihilism against objective reality, the cult of personality against the rule of law and decency against cruelty.\n\nIronically, it also pits evangelical power brokers against values like humility, kindness, tolerance, family and self-restraint. Trump has revealed the emptiness of Christian conservatives who held themselves out to be guardians of the culture, protectors of families, sticklers for uprightness in our political leaders and advocates for subsidiarity (which is defined as governance that is best performed by the authority closest to the people). They are now enablers of Trump, all too willing to fan the flames of white grievance, demonize outsiders, condone corruption, ignore the suffering of innocents and deny others the same constitutional protections they claim for themselves. (Make no mistake, I refer not to millions of decent Christians, but to the Jerry Falwell Jr.-Tony Perkins-Franklin Graham set that has given up its principles for power.)\n\nMy colleague Michael Gerson explained earlier this year:\n\nIt is remarkable to hear religious leaders defend profanity, ridicule, and cruelty as hallmarks of authenticity and dismiss decency as a dead language. Whatever Trump\u2019s policy legacy ends up being, his presidency has been a disaster in the realm of norms. It has coarsened our culture, given permission for bullying, complicated the moral formation of children, undermined standards of public integrity, and encouraged cynicism about the political enterprise. Falwell, Graham, and others are providing religious cover for moral squalor \u2014 winking at trashy behavior and encouraging the unraveling of social restraints. Instead of defending their convictions, they are providing preemptive absolution for their political favorites. And this, even by purely political standards, undermines the causes they embrace. Turning a blind eye to the exploitation of women certainly doesn\u2019t help in making pro-life arguments. It materially undermines the movement, which must ultimately change not only the composition of the courts but the views of the public. Having given politics pride of place, these evangelical leaders have ceased to be moral leaders in any meaningful sense.\n\nAnd here is where the midterms, the crackup of the right and the opening for the Democrats (or a third party) come in. With Trump in office and self-appointed \u201cvalues\u201d leaders on the right now exemplifying the worst human characteristics, we have a values void in politics. For two years, we have, in effect, been told that truth, kindness, empathy and respect for democratic norms are for suckers.\n\nThe right stopped advocating for values, character and public decency; the left, until recently, has been squeamish about bringing such things (in part, for fear of sounding like the hypocritical evangelical operators). But here is the opportunity and a possible organizing principle for opponents of Trump and the moral nihilism that has engulfed the GOP and hovers ominously over the country.\n\nThe best candidates of this election cycle are those who appealed to the better angels of our nature. Why did Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (D-Tex.) create such a splash? Running against arguably one of the least-principled men in politics, he has called for a return to American values and principles like welcoming the stranger, national unity, respect for dissent and protection of the rule of law. That is the message \u2014 the rebuke of Trump and his ilk.\n\nIt turns out that, whatever their religion, or even if they follow no religion, Americans actually want their country to behave decently. It upsets them when children are ripped from the arms of their parents. They recoil in horror and rush to their neighbors\u2019 aid when crazed haters attack part of their community. They deplore (at least they overwhelmingly say so in polls) Trump\u2019s vulgarity, coarseness, lying and meanness. They don\u2019t want to be joined at the hip with a regime that would murder and dismember a journalist.\n\nThis, I would suggest, is where a big-picture vision in opposition to Trumpism must start: A reaffirmation of the basic goodness and fundamental values (tolerance, respect, etc.) that have been essential to our multi-racial and multi-ethnic democracy. It starts with restating that we are a country founded on a creed (\u201cAll men are created equal . . .\u201d), not on blood or soil. It calls for ethical government (and sweeping reform), transparency, adherence to facts (including science), respect for equal branches of government and for our democratic allies, promotion of civic obligations (starting with increased access to voting and including a robust national service program) and American leadership in the world, grounded in our defense of universal human rights.\n\nMichael Bloomberg seems to grasp our collective yearning for a \u201chigher purpose\u201d:\n\nOther political leaders should take notice. Americans are hungry for something better than the stew of lies, hatred and authoritarianism that Trump and his ilk serve up each day.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe final polls tell us why Trump may sink the GOP\n\nFive things to look for today\n\nWhat can we expect from the midterms?

(Ebrahim Noroozi/Associated Press)\n\nTEHRAN, Iran \u2014 The \u201clargest-ever\u201d U.S. sanctions list targeting Iran drew mockery from Iranian officials on Tuesday for including mothballed Boeing 747s, a bank that closed years earlier and a sunken oil tanker that exploded off China months ago.\n\nHowever, the new list of sanctions, which also aims to cut Iran\u2019s vital oil industry off from international sales, also included for the first time its state airline and its atomic energy commission, further highlighting the maximalist approach of President Donald Trump\u2019s administration.\n\nTrump pulled America out of the 2015 nuclear deal Iran struck with world powers in May. United Nations monitors say Iran still abides by the deal, in which it agreed to limit its uranium enrichment in return for the lifting of international sanctions.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury Department imposed penalties on more than 700 Iranian and Iranian-linked individuals, entities, aircraft and vessels in the new sanctions. Among those are 50 Iranian banks and subsidiaries, and more than 200 people and ships.\n\nHowever, scattered among the list are surprising entries, like the crude oil tanker Sanchi. That vessel collided with a bulk freighter and caught fire off China\u2019s east coast in January, killing all 32 sailors aboard.\n\nAnother entry was Iran\u2019s Tat Bank, which closed in 2012.\n\nForeign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif took to Twitter to mock some of the targets of the sanctions, describing it as a \u201cdesperate\u201d psychological ploy.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. designated a bank that was closed 6 years ago, and a ship that sank . in a widely televised saga,\u201d he wrote, ending the tweet with \u201c(hashtag)USisIsolated.\u201d\n\nBut for the first time, the United States targeted Iran Air. It also sanctioned the state carrier\u2019s mothballed fleet of Boeing 747s, which were manufactured in the 1970s.\n\nIt also appeared that the U.S., in another first, was directly sanctioning the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, the government agency that oversees Iran\u2019s nuclear program. Prior sanctions targeted specific subsidiaries of the organization.\n\nEshaq Jahangiri, President Hassan Rouhani\u2019s senior vice president, also criticized the sanctions.\n\n\u201cAmericans think their list is more effective if it is longer,\u201d Jahangiri said, according to the state-run IRNA news agency. He said he had discussed the list with other officials, with many saying it was \u201cless than what we expected.\u201d\n\nStill, Jahangiri warned that \u201cAmericans intend to damage economy of the country\u201d through psychological warfare.\n\nZarif later issued an online video criticizing America\u2019s \u201cindiscriminate assault\u201d on his country.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. administration appears to believe that imposing illegal draconian sanctions on Iran will bring about such pain to our nation that it will force us to submit to its will, no matter how absurd, unlawful or fundamentally flawed its demands are.\u201d\n\nZarif urged America to re-examine its \u201ccatastrophes\u201d in the Mideast, including its support for Saudi Arabia and Israel.\n\nIran is already in the grip of an economic crisis. Its national currency, the rial, now trades at 150,000 to one U.S. dollar; a year ago, it was about 40,500. The economic chaos sparked mass anti-government protests at the end of last year, resulting in nearly 5,000 reported arrests and at least 25 people being killed.\n\nSporadic smaller demonstrations still reportedly erupt from time to time.\n\nThe new sanctions particularly hurt Iran\u2019s vital oil industry, which provides a crucial source of hard currency. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the sanctions already had cost Iran the sale of over 1 million barrels of crude oil a day.\n\nAnalysts feared in the run-up to the sanctions that global oil prices could spike on tight supply and increasing demand. However, the Trump administration allowed some of its allies \u2014 Greece, India, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Turkey \u2014 as well as rival China to continue to purchase Iranian oil as long as they work to reduce imports to zero. The price of benchmark Brent crude has dropped from over $80 a barrel in recent days.\n\nDuring a visit to Madrid on Tuesday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the U.S. decision to re-impose sanctions on Iran was \u201cnot legitimate\u201d and that the rest of the parties to the 2015 nuclear deal abandoned by Washington are working to make economic cooperation with Tehran possible.\n\nLavrov\u2019s remarks were Russia\u2019s first reaction to Washington\u2019s new list of sanctions against Iran. The Russian diplomat said the sanctions go against international law and practices, and that the U.S. \u201cpolicies of issuing an ultimatum and making unilateral moves are unacceptable these days.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Aritz Parra in Madrid contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Ryan (R-Wis.) appears at a campaign event on Monday. (Tannen Maury/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)\n\nNearly 140 West Virginians living abroad in 29 countries have cast their election ballots in an unprecedented pilot project that involves voting remotely by mobile device, according to state officials.\n\nThe statewide pilot, which covers 24 of West Virginia\u2019s 55 counties, uses a mixture of smartphones, facial recognition and the same technology that underpins bitcoin \u2014 the blockchain \u2014 in an effort to create a large-scale and secure way for service members, Peace Corps volunteers or other Americans living overseas to participate in the midterm elections.\n\nWest Virginia is the first state to run a blockchain-based voting project at such a scale, state officials say. And if adopted more widely, the technology could make it easier to vote and potentially reduce long lines at the polls. But many security experts worry that the technology may not be ready for broader use \u2014 and could even contain vulnerabilities that risks the integrity of elections.\n\nBy the end of Tuesday, election officials expect more votes to roll in digitally from as many as five additional countries. Voters have already submitted ballots from Albania, Botswana, Egypt, Mexico and Japan, among others, said Michael Queen, deputy chief of staff to West Virginia Secretary of State Mac Warner. Warner\u2019s son, who is in the military and stationed abroad, has also participated in the pilot, Queen said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s already been very successful,\u201d Queen said. \u201cWe\u2019re very pleased with the participation.\u201d\n\nAs many as 300,000 U.S. voters located overseas requested ballots in the 2016 elections but failed to submit them, said Queen, a figure that suggests many Americans face difficulty participating in the democratic process.\n\nWest Virginia sought to solve the problem by turning to Voatz, a company that in January received $2.2 million from Medici Ventures, a blockchain-focused investment firm owned by the online retailer Overstock.com.\n\nThe Voatz app has been used on a limited basis in a number of other settings, such as student council races and West Virginia\u2019s May primary. But Election Day represents the company\u2019s biggest test yet.\n\nTo cast a ballot, voters must first register through the app by uploading an image of their driver\u2019s license or other photo identification. Then the app instructs them to submit a short video of their own face. Facial recognition technology supplied by a voter\u2019s iPhone or Android device matches the video against the photo ID, and the personal information on the ID is matched to West Virginia\u2019s voter registration database. Once the verification is complete, voters can make their selections and confirm their ballot by fingerprint or facial recognition.\n\nHilary Braseth, Voatz\u2019s director of product design, said that in addition to using technology for verification, the company also has human workers manually reviewing the submitted information. The company does not store the personal data once a voter\u2019s identity has been confirmed, she said.\n\nVotes are stored on a private blockchain \u2014 essentially a database where records are secured using complex computational algorithms \u2014 and unlocked by county clerks when the polls close.\n\n\u201cWhen they take the votes from the blockchain, it will immediately print onto a paper ballot \u2014 just like the same look and feel of what voters are physically voting with on Election Day,\u201d Braseth said. \u201cAnd then those paper ballots will be fed into the tabulating machines on the ground at the state level.\u201d\n\nOverseas voters who used Voatz will receive an anonymized copy of the ballot that they submitted remotely; another copy will be made available to Warner\u2019s office for auditing purposes. Several independent, outside auditors are expected to spend the following months performing an assessment of the pilot project, and with a report probably due by mid-spring.\n\nTwo voters so far have reported difficulties using the app, Queen said, but the process has otherwise proceeded smoothly. In response to questions about security, Queen said West Virginia has no plans to extend mobile voting beyond its relatively small overseas population.\n\n\u201cSecretary Warner has never and will never advocate that this is a solution for mainstream voting,\u201d Queen said.\n\nVoting with Voatz is probably more secure than submitting absentee ballots by email, said Maurice Turner, an election security expert at the Center for Democracy and Technology, a Washington think tank. And because the system relies on facial recognition tech produced by Apple and other vetted devicemakers, the verification method seems sound. But, he said, it remains far less secure than submitting a paper ballot in person.\n\nEven though human workers may be analyzing the photo identification and user-submitted videos, that does not prevent someone from trying to impersonate a voter by digitally manipulating the photo ID before uploading it, Turner said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not authenticating the voter. It\u2019s authenticating the person who\u2019s using the app,\u201d he said.\n\nOther security experts have said that simply by introducing an Internet-connected mobile device into the process raises the baseline risk of hacking or interception.\n\nAnd despite the current use of cryptography to keep remotely submitted ballots secret on the blockchain, future technologies that could defeat that protection may end up unmasking voters' identities and choices.\n\nIf I can verify that my vote was correctly recorded, then your local mob boss can also use my receipt to verify the same thing. \u2014 Matthew Green (@matthew_d_green) August 28, 2018\n\nStill, Turner said, as many aspects of consumers' lives go digital, it\u2019s no surprise that voters might expect the same from their engagement with the civic process.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re coming upon a time where the average voter is someone who grew up with digital devices,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we can accept that, then we can plan for it accordingly. If we make the assumption that voters will move to mobile devices, we can start thinking about what are the policies, what are the regulations to put in place, to make sure it can happen \u2014 and what security measures need to be designed into those platforms.\u201d", "YAOUNDE, Cameroon \u2014 Cameroon\u2019s President Paul Biya, sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s oldest leader, was inaugurated Tuesday for his seventh term in office amid rising separatist unrest.\n\nThe 85-year-old Biya, who has been in power since 1982, was sworn in days after separatists allegedly kidnapped dozens of students and an American missionary was fatally shot as soldiers and separatists exchanged gunfire.\n\nBiya asked all the fighters opposing his government to drop their guns, threatening further military action.

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned the kidnappings and called Tuesday for the immediate release of the abducted students and adults.\n\nGuterres stressed \u201cthere can be no justification for these crimes against civilians, particularly minors,\u201d U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said.\n\nA video was released on social media Monday by the apparent kidnappers, showing some of the boys saying they were taken by separatists fighting to create the independent state of Ambazonia.\n\nHowever, the Ambazonia Governing Council, the separatists\u2019 official organization, released a statement condemning the kidnappings and demanding freedom for people taken from the school.\n\nThe council called on the military to withdraw from the regions it calls Ambazonia, to avoid further escalation of violence.\n\nThe unrest began in November 2016 when English-speaking teachers and lawyers in the northwest and southwest began calling for reforms and greater autonomy in the largely French-speaking country.\n\nThey marched in the streets, criticizing what they called the marginalization of English speakers by French speakers. Armed separatists later took over the protests and began using violence in pursuit of their goal.\n\nFighting between the armed separatists and security forces has killed hundreds. The unrest has also forced tens of thousands to flee. The Oct. 7 presidential election saw few voters in the Anglophone regions.\n\n\u201cThe objective of the secessionists is against our constitution that consecrates the indivisible nature of our nation,\u201d Biya said at his inauguration. \u201cWe have started implementing measures to attend to the grievances raised by teachers and lawyers by accelerating the decentralization process.\u201d\n\nThe conflict poses a serious challenge for Cameroon, a close U.S. security ally in combating extremism and a new member of the U.N. Human Rights Council.\n\nThe U.N.\u2019s Dujarric said Guterres reiterated the need for a peaceful solution to the crisis in the English-speaking regions \u201cthrough an inclusive dialogue process.\u201d He said the U.N. \u201cstands ready to assist in this regard.\u201d\n\n___\n\nPetesch reported from Dakar, Senegal.

He was listed as a \u201cspecial guest\u201d at President Trump\u2019s rally Monday night in Cape Girardeau, Mo. Yet he tweeted that he wouldn\u2019t appear onstage to boost Trump and his midterm agenda:\n\nIn spite of reports, I will be doing a live show from Cape Girardeau and interviewing President Trump before the rally. To be clear, I will not be on stage campaigning with the President. I am covering final rally for my show. Something I have done in every election in the past. \u2014 Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) November 5, 2018\n\nSo much for that.\n\nPresident Trump called Hannity to the podium at the rally. Hannity came right up. With some autocratic gusto, too. \u201cBy the way, all of those people in the back are fake news,\u201d said Hannity, sounding as if he\u2019d been wanting to deliver just that message for quite some time. We\u2019ve asked Fox News if Hannity might have been addressing any Fox News journalists in attendance at the rally. Correspondent Kristin Fisher covered the event for Fox News. \u201cI\u2019ve covered a lot of President Trump\u2019s rallies,\u201d said Fisher in an 11 p.m. report from the venue. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve got to say, this rally, the energy in this room \u2014 people here are really fired up.\u201d\n\nPerhaps some of that fire came from Hannity\u2019s involvement. He placed the Fox News brand more squarely behind Trump\u2019s agenda than anyone at network had ever done before, and that\u2019s some feat. \u201cMr. President,\u201d said Hannity, \u201cI did an opening monologue today and I had no idea you were going to invite me up here.\u201d\n\nNo idea! This shellshocked TV host still managed to deliver a short and punchy endorsement of the president. Lots of nightly practice came through for him: \u201cThe one thing that has made and defined your presidency more than anything else: Promises made, promises kept. Four and a half million new American jobs, 4.3 million Americans off of food stamps, 4 million Americans out of poverty and we\u2019re not dropping \u2026 cargo planes of cash to Iranian mullahs that chant \u2018Death to America.\u2019 Mr. President, thank you.\u201d\n\nFox News host Jeanine Pirro also appeared onstage to praise Trump\u2019s pugnacity. \u201cDo you like the fact that we are now in the longest, strongest economic growth streak in American history? Do you like the fact that this man is the tip of the spear who goes out there every day and fights for us?\u201d asked Pirro.\n\nAnd with that, the Fox News hosts continued an ongoing project. They have been campaigning for Trump for quite some time. If there\u2019s a prominent critic of Trump, that critic will come in for a battering from Hannity and Pirro. If there\u2019s an argument that Trump wants to float, Hannity and Pirro will take care of that formality. And if there\u2019s an entire group of people that Trump wants to discredit \u2014 such as the mainstream U.S. media \u2014 he\u2019s assured of help on that front as well.\n\nAppearing before a cheering throng, however, brings greater transparency to the relationship. In the 2016 campaign, for instance, Hannity served as an informal adviser to candidate Trump; he helped fly a vice presidential candidate to meet with Trump; and he even gave a 32-second testimonial in an eight-minute video promotion for Trump on the topic of Second Amendment rights:\n\nIn the presentation, Hannity says:\n\nOne of the reasons I\u2019m supporting Donald Trump this year is No. 1, he\u2019s going to put originalists on the Supreme Court, people that believe in fidelity to the Constitution, separation of powers, co-equal branches of government. He\u2019s a guy that will vet refugees to keep Americans safe. And of course he\u2019s gonna build that wall. He says he\u2019s gonna have Mexico pay for it. That\u2019s fine, as long as we secure the country and of course we don\u2019t want people competing for jobs. He said he will eliminate Obamacare, make us energy-independent. And as somebody who\u2019s been a marksman since I\u2019m 11 years old, protecting our Second Amendment rights are paramount to me.\n\nFor that bit of boosterism, Hannity received a rebuke from his employer. \u201cWe had no knowledge that Sean Hannity was participating in this,\u201d said a Fox News spokesperson at the time, \u201cand he will not be doing anything along these lines for the remainder of the election.\u201d\n\nNow: If Fox News had a problem with Hannity appearing in some interminable Trump campaign video, wouldn\u2019t it stand to reason that it might also have a problem with him appearing onstage at a campaign rally with the president? We have placed that question before Fox News PR reps. We have not yet received a response but will update this post when/if we do.\n\nRead more:\n\nWhat took U.S. media orgs so long to realize Trump ad was racist?

Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) fights to defend his seat from a potential Democratic wave, one of his last interviews to air before Election Day was with Triumph, who caught the senator\u2019s attention at a rally by shouting: \u201cI have a preexisting condition that makes me vomit out of my eyes whenever I look at you.\u201d\n\nThe Yugoslavian Mountain Hound and his camera crew were in Texas last week, although the footage didn\u2019t air until Monday night on \u201cThe Late Show With Stephen Colbert.\u201d Perhaps in an effort to show bipartisan neutrality, Triumph first crashed a Houston rally for Cruz\u2019s Democratic opponent, Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, who has raised more than $70 million and is polling within a few points of Cruz in the deeply conservative state.\n\n[An 82-year-old Texas woman voted for the first time. Then she died.]\n\n\u201cBeto, I saw the speech,\u201d Triumph told O\u2019Rourke after tracking him through a crowd of excited fans. \u201cI loved the way you were anybody but Ted Cruz.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said with a wide grin.\n\n\u201cTell me this Beto,\u201d Triumph asked. \u201cDoes it concern you that half your base thinks they can vote for you through Instagram?\u201d\n\nO\u2019Rourke\u2019s grin suddenly seemed a little tense. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s going to have to turn into real votes,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019re seeing a real voter turnout so far \u2014 \u201d\n\n[Can Taylor Swift\u2019s Instagram turn Tennessee blue?

He shook his head. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can say.\"\n\nThen it was on to Harlingen, where Triumph put on a cowboy hat and stuck a cigar in his maw as he forged into a sea of Cruz fans.\n\nThis was hardly Triumph the Insult Comic Dog\u2019s first political assignment. \u201cThe poop I left in the dressing room has more heat coming off it than his campaign,\u201d he said on the \u201cTonight Show\u201d in 2003, just before Democratic presidential candidate John F. Kerry took the stage. \u201cKerry seemed slightly shaken by the dog puppet\u2019s jabs, and took a few moments to get settled,\u201d the Los Angeles Times wrote.\n\nAfter years of campaign trail work, Triumph first tried to interview Cruz in early 2016 while the senator campaigned against Donald Trump for the Republican presidential nomination. He even strapped himself to a drone to chase a campaign bus, but like Cruz\u2019s race that year, the puppet\u2019s efforts failed.\n\nTriumph had better luck in Harlingen last week. \u201cYou can\u2019t ignore me, Ted,\u201d he shouted as he pushed through a crowd. \u201cI\u2019m not overwhelming scientific evidence of global warming!\u201d\n\n[Ted Cruz keeps saying that satellites don\u2019t show global warming. Here\u2019s the problem]\n\nCruz sheltered for a while in a throng of fans seeking autographed \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hats, but he finally acknowledged the dog.\n\n\u201cHey, welcome to Texas,\u201d he said. Warmly, even.\n\nTriumph sounded genuinely surprised. \u201cHow are you, Ted?\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t believe this! This is a privilege! Can you tell these people not to kill me if I make a joke or two?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat depends how bad a joke,\u201d Cruz quipped. The senator laughed, but almost everyone else behind the camera was scowling at the puppet \u2014 or possibly at comedian Robert Smigel, who has accompanied Triumph on all his outings since the dog\u2019s TV debut in 1997.\n\n\u201cTed, is it true you will defend the Constitution at all costs, except for when Donald Trump calls it ugly on Twitter?\u201d Triumph asked.\n\nCruz inhaled and put a hand on his chest. \u201cI love the Constitution,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd Twitter is Twitter.\u201d\n\n(For the record, Cruz did defend his wife when Trump suggested she was unattractive during the 2016 primary race. But he soon forgave Trump, who never apologized.)\n\nCruz looked game to field more questions from the insult dog, but the crowd around him was visibly agitated. A police officer barricaded the puppet from the senator with his arm. \u201cTalk with your supporters, not him!\u201d a woman yelled at Cruz.\n\n\n\n\"The Late Show With Stephen Colbert\" via YouTube.

Triumph\u2019s play on his ethnicity seemed to cut the tension in the room. \u201cLet\u2019s be civil here,\u201d the dog said. \u201cNobody should be yelling at this man in a public place.

(Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)\n\nThe Redskins are alone atop the NFC East at the halfway point of their season, but the challenge of remaining there got significantly more difficult with Monday\u2019s news that right guard Brandon Scherff, left guard Shawn Lauvao and wide receiver Paul Richardson Jr. are out for the year with injuries.\n\n\u201cThis is something you don\u2019t want to go through, but it is pro football, and you have to go through it,\u201d Redskins Coach Jay Gruden told reporters. \u201cFortunately we have a very good offensive line coach in Coach [Bill] Callahan, and we\u2019ll figure it out and make it work.\u201d\n\nLeft tackle Trent Williams is expected to be out another two or three games after thumb surgery. Morgan Moses is day-to-day after injuring his knee in Sunday\u2019s loss to the Falcons. Callahan deserves a significant raise if he can prevent Washington\u2019s decimated offensive line from derailing a promising season like it did last year.\n\n[At halfway mark, Redskins' playoff chances threatened by injuries, sluggish offense]\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t get it, man,\u201d Santana Moss said Monday during his weekly appearance with Chad Dukes on 106.7 The Fan. \u201cEvery year for the last, what, three years now? . . . It\u2019s just hard to see these guys be consistent. We keep preaching consistency, consistency, consistency. We want to see these guys be consistent, but it\u2019s hard, because they\u2019re not even healthy enough to be out there with all the guys. All we can do is pray for them. Bow your head.

Green\u2019s foot injury.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re talking about four offensive linemen who are basically down and out, that they either have lost for an extended period, or for the season,\u201d Schefter said on \u201cNFL Live.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s hard when you\u2019re fighting for first place in the NFC East to lose four starting offensive linemen for an indefinite period of time and maintain the level of consistency you\u2019ve had all year long. The Redskins losing so many players to such big injuries, to me, is the biggest development here.\"\n\n[Fortnite is adding NFL skins and the ensuing cash is going to fill Loot Lake]\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been the identity of their team,\u201d ESPN analyst Tim Hasselbeck said. \u201cOne of the biggest surprises this season has been Adrian Peterson playing the way that Adrian Peterson has played for the Washington Redskins, being in sole possession of first place in the NFC East. I think in some ways, it changes the identity of who that team is. That offensive line is a very good offensive line that they have been investing in in Washington.\"\n\nPeterson, who was limited to 17 yards on nine carries in Sunday\u2019s loss, will be in the running for Comeback Player of the Year honors and is the main reason the Redskins are 5-3. The 33-year-old has praised Washington\u2019s offensive line all season, but there\u2019s a chance he couldn\u2019t name the five guys who will be tasked with creating holes for him Sunday at Tampa Bay.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t lose four out of your five starting offensive linemen and expect to be good,\u201d former Patriots linebacker and NFL Network analyst Willie McGinest said on \u201cNFL Total Access.\u201d \u201cThey run the ball, predicated on their offensive [line\u2019s] physicality. This is bad for AP. [When Peterson has] 15 or more carries a game, they\u2019re undefeated. Now they\u2019re not going to be effective running the football. They don\u2019t pass the ball down the field.\"\n\nThe Redskins' remaining schedule is favorable, and according to FiveThirtyEight\u2032s projections, they still have a 43 percent chance to make the playoffs and a 35 percent chance to win the division.\n\n\u201cThey stumbled today; that happens.

Bolsonaro is insisting on his respect for the country\u2019s constitution, implicitly responding to fears his administration might roll back civil rights. (Eraldo Peres/Associated Press)\n\nSAO PAULO \u2014 Key to Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s recent election victory was the support of Brazil\u2019s business community, which coalesced around him because he promised to overhaul Latin America\u2019s largest economy and address its worrying budget deficit. But the president-elect has been stingy with the details, and many wonder if he\u2019ll stick to his recent conversion to market-friendly reforms or if the dormant nationalist in him might reappear.\n\nEven if he holds fast to the agenda set forth by his economic guru Paulo Guedes, a University of Chicago-trained economist and the man who convinced many investors to take a chance on Bolsonaro, the former army captain could face fierce opposition in Congress and from labor unions to what will be undoubtedly unpopular measures. His economic agenda will also have to compete for priority with his better-known promises to crack down on crime and corruption, and the latter are much dearer to his heart \u2014 and his base.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really unclear what Bolsonaro is when it comes to economic policy,\u201d said Matthew Taylor, an associate professor at American University\u2019s School of International Service. \u201cHe himself has admitted to ignorance on the economic front, but he\u2019s also an extraordinary statist and a nationalist.\u201d\n\nFor years, Bolsonaro, who will be inaugurated Jan. 1, supported heavy involvement of the state in the economy, and he remains an admirer of Brazil\u2019s 1964-1985 military regime, which supported nationalist policies. But during the campaign, he espoused free-market principles.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how complete his conversion is. For instance, after Guedes told reporters that he supported privatizing all of Brazil\u2019s dozens of state companies, Bolsonaro walked that back, saying he would sell off many but keep \u201cstrategic\u201d ones, including big names like Petrobras and Banco do Brasil.\n\nAmid this swirl of doubt, one thing is clear: Brazil must quickly cut its deficit or it risks heading back into crisis. A World Bank analysis concluded last year that Brazil spends more than it can afford and spends poorly.\n\nBrazil\u2019s central government deficit was 7 percent of gross domestic product in 2017, according to the Central Bank, and has been above 5 percent in recent years. A large portion is interest payments on debt, but even excluding those, Brazil still had a primary deficit of 1.8 percent of GDP last year \u2014 which economists say is unsustainable because it means the already high debt level will continue to grow.\n\nThe new administration will have only a narrow window to show investors that it\u2019s serious about addressing this problem \u2014 by cutting spending or raising taxes \u2014 before they will begin to balk, making an adjustment more difficult because it could drive up borrowing costs.\n\nCompounding the challenge, Brazil is only just beginning to emerge from a two-year-long recession, and growth remains stagnant. That means it can\u2019t rely on big increases in tax revenues to help it plug the hole \u2014 and Bolsonaro has even promised to cut tax rates.\n\nGuedes, who will lead the Economy Ministry, appeared to be sending just that signal hours after Bolsonaro\u2019s victory on Oct. 28. He laid out a three-part plan to reduce Brazil\u2019s public spending by passing a pension reform, privatizing state companies to draw down the debt and enacting other unspecified reforms that will reduce \u201cprivileges and waste.\u201d\n\nPension reform will be the linchpin in reducing Brazil\u2019s state spending for two reasons: Brazil\u2019s government spends more on pensions than anything else, and many other parts of the budget can\u2019t be altered because they\u2019re mandated by the constitution.\n\nAttempts to reform the pension system will likely face stiff resistance from labor unions and other groups since any measure will force Brazilians to work longer and receive fewer benefits. Bolsonaro, who in 27 years in Congress didn\u2019t show any particular gift for building consensus, will have to build a broad coalition to get a reform through. His Social Liberal Party holds about 10 percent of the seats in next Congress, but so does the Workers\u2019 Party, which is against such a reform and has vowed tough opposition.\n\nPresident Michel Temer, who is known for his ability to negotiate with Congress, failed at that task. Still, Glauco Legat, the chief analyst at the brokerage Spinelli, points out that Bolsonaro\u2019s decisive win gives him more legitimacy than Temer, who came to power after his predecessor was impeached in controversial proceedings.\n\nAny reform will be whittled away at in order to win votes, but Monica de Bolle, director of Latin American Studies at Johns Hopkins University, says she fears Bolsonaro\u2019s proposal will lack ambition right out of the gate since he has indicated he will leave military personnel out of it. That could also mean he will exclude other civil service sectors, which are key to taking a bite out of the problem.\n\n\u201cThe watering down process is going to take place on the basis of an already diluted reform,\u201d she said.\n\nBeyond pension reform, Bolsonaro has promised to reduce the size of the state, including halving the number of ministries, and selling off state companies. Reducing the number of ministries could yield some savings, but other presidents have struggled to do that in more than name. And Bolsonaro has already taken off the table many state companies that would yield the most cash.\n\nInstead, economists say that many of the savings lie in eliminating inefficiencies. Guedes didn\u2019t give details, but if he\u2019s serious about reducing waste, there\u2019s plenty of it: The World Bank analysis highlighted Brazil\u2019s high civil service salaries, a constitutional mandate on education spending that often results in spending for spending\u2019s sake, overlapping social welfare programs and a proliferation of small hospitals in the public health system.\n\nDespite the challenges, Legat said it\u2019s important to remember that just by virtue of saying he\u2019ll take on Brazil\u2019s thorny issues, Bolsonaro has built momentum, which can have real-world effects.\n\n\u201cHe brings optimism that\u2019s very important for the economy in this moment,\u201d he said. \u201cThis increase in confidence is reflected in real numbers.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press video journalist Victor Caivano contributed to this report.\n\nFollow Sarah DiLorenzo: www.twitter.com/sdilorenzo\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Rajesh Kumar Singh/Associated Press)\n\nAYODHYA, India \u2014 The northern Indian city of Ayodhya broke a Guinness World Record on Tuesday by lighting 300,150 earthen lamps and keeping them burning for at least 45 minutes on the banks of the river Saryu as part of the annual celebration of Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights.\n\nSouth Korean first lady Kim Jung-sook attended the record-breaking event after meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi during a four-day visit to India.\n\nHer presence was significant because of a Korean legend that a princess from Ayodhya traveled to Korea and married a king, becoming a Korean queen in the year 48 AD.\n\nYogi Adityanath, chief minister of the state of Uttar Pradesh, was given a certificate certifying the record by Guinness officials who had monitored the attempt with drone cameras.\n\nAs dusk fell in Ayodhya, where Hindus believe the god Lord Ram was born and where he returned after 14 years in exile, volunteers lit lamps, called diyas, snaking along the river, through lanes and at houses.\n\nA similar attempt failed to break the record last year, when strong winds blew over many of the lamps.

The president helped Republicans win hotly contested Senate races in Indiana, Missouri, North Dakota, Tennessee and Texas, and proclaimed the election\u2019s outcome a \u201ctremendous success.\u201d Republicans held their grip throughout the South and in rural and exurban areas.\n\nBut Democrats \u2014 propelled by a rejection of Trumpism in the nation\u2019s suburbs, and from women and minority voters especially \u2014 notched victories in areas that just two years ago helped send Trump to the White House.\n\nIn the high-turnout election, Democrats performed well across much of the upper Midwest and even in ruby-red Kansas, where Laura Kelly was elected governor over the president\u2019s handpicked candidate, Kris Kobach. In Wisconsin, Democrat Tony Evers bested Gov. Scott Walker, once a Republican star who ran for president in 2016. Walker survived a hard-fought recall vote in 2012, and was reelected in 2014, only to be denied a third term by the state schools superintendent.\n\nIncumbent Republicans fell in an array of suburban House districts, including the one held by House Rules Committee Chairman Pete Sessions in the Dallas area. And in West Virginia \u2014 where Trump is wildly popular and campaigned heavily for Republicans \u2014 the reelection of Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin III delivered a personal blow to the president.\n\nCompetitive Senate races in Arizona and Montana were too close to call.\n\nReturns early Wednesday showed Democrats poised to pick up more than the 23 House seats they needed to gain a foothold in Congress from which to counter Trump. Democrats were projected to flip at least 29 districts currently held by the GOP, while they were on track to surrender only a few seats in the chamber.\n\nWith power in Washington divided, House Democrats are likely to try to block the president\u2019s agenda and use their subpoena power to investigate him and his administration.\n\n\u201cThanks to you, tomorrow will be a new day in America,\u201d said House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif.), who is poised to reclaim the speaker\u2019s gavel she lost eight years ago.\n\n1 of 98 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 The scene as midterm votes were cast across the country View Photos Democrats and Republicans vied for control of the House and Senate.

Women currently hold 84 House seats, but that share is projected to expand to 100 or more when all results are tallied. Across the country, 277 women were on the ballot Tuesday for Congress and governorships, an unprecedented number that included 210 House candidates.\n\n[Record number of women appear headed to Congress]\n\nBut Democrats were disappointed elsewhere. Sens. Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Claire McCaskill of Missouri were defeated, while Sen. Bill Nelson\u2019s reelection in Florida appeared in doubt. Republican Marsha Blackburn won the open Senate seat in Tennessee, which Democrats had hoped would slide into their column.\n\nDemocrats did pick up a seat in Nevada, where Democratic Rep. Jacky Rosen prevailed over Sen. Dean Heller, the Republican incumbent. The governor\u2019s mansion in Nevada is also set to change hands, as Republican Adam Laxalt conceded to Democrat Steve Sisolak, who is poised to replace the term-limited Brian Sandoval.\n\nRosen, who by early Wednesday was the lone Democratic challenger to fell a Republican incumbent in the Senate, cast her victory as a counterpoint to the racist and anti-Semitic rhetoric that had marked the closing days of the midterm campaign.\n\n\u201cAfter all the hate, all the hate that I\u2019ve seen recently, that we\u2019ve all seen, I can\u2019t tell you how much this means to me as a former synagogue president,\u201d Rosen told supporters in Las Vegas.\n\nTwo of the liberal movement\u2019s greatest hopes, Democrats Stacey Abrams and Andrew Gillum, struggled to overcome some of the most overt racial attacks since the civil rights era and make history as the first black governors in Georgia and Florida, respectively.\n\nGillum conceded to Republican Ron DeSantis, a Trump ally, while the Georgia race was too close to call. Early Wednesday morning, Abrams told supporters she would not concede to Republican Brian Kemp and warned that their right to vote was on the line.\n\n\u201cIn a civilized nation, the machinery of democracy should work for everyone, everywhere,\u201d Abrams said, alluding to complaints about ballot access and election fairness that have marked her divisive contest with Kemp, who oversees elections as Georgia\u2019s secretary of state. \u201cI'm not going to name names, but some have worked hard to take our voices away.\u201d\n\nKemp stopped short of declaring victory outright but told supporters, \u201cThe math is on our side to win this election.\u201d\n\nIf the candidates were to wind up below 50 percent, they would go head-to-head again in a December runoff.\n\nAnother Democratic star, Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas, lost his spirited challenge to Sen. Ted Cruz (R) despite raising record sums of money and attracting grass-roots support throughout the country.\n\n\u201cAll the money in the world was no match for the good people of Texas and the hardworking men and women across our state,\u201d Cruz said in his victory speech.\n\nMidterm elections traditionally are referendums on the party in power, but Trump sought to ensure that this one would be a referendum on his presidency. He told crowds to vote as if he were atop the ballot, warning that his agenda and political movement were at risk, and he made himself the central force with an overwhelming cascade of speeches, media interviews and tweets.\n\nThe president returned to his 2016 campaign playbook, delivering fiery speeches that drew massive and enthusiastic crowds but contained a breathtaking barrage of falsehoods, invective and demagoguery. Describing himself in the closing weeks as a \u201cnationalist,\u201d Trump made a caravan of Central American migrants seeking asylum in the United States a dominant theme.\n\nThe Senate results underscored just how much the Republican Party has morphed into the party of Trump. The incoming freshman class of Republicans is made up largely of Trump allies \u2014 including Mike Braun in Indiana, Josh Hawley in Missouri and Kevin Cramer in North Dakota \u2014 who campaigned effectively as rubber stamps for the president\u2019s agenda and owe their new jobs, at least in part, to his energetic campaigning on their behalf.\n\n\u201cWithout him, I don\u2019t think we would have had the night we had,\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who has transformed himself from one of the president\u2019s sharpest critics into one of his most stalwart defenders, said on Fox News.\n\n[Winners and losers from election night 2018]\n\nAn exception is Mitt Romney, who handily won his race for the open Senate seat in Utah, marking a return to the national stage for the party\u2019s 2012 presidential nominee who in 2016 denounced Trump as a \u201ccon man\u201d and a \u201cfraud.\u201d Following the death of Sen. John McCain (Ariz.) and the retirements of Sens. Jeff Flake (Ariz.) and Bob Corker (Tenn.), Romney is poised to become the leading GOP counterweight to Trump on Capitol Hill, if he chooses to stand up to the president.\n\nRomney, the former Massachusetts governor, becomes the first politician in 173 years to serve as governor of one state and then represent another in the Senate. The last to accomplish the feat was Sam Houston, who was Tennessee governor before being elected to the Senate from Texas.\n\nTuesday\u2019s results were set to transform the House, not only in partisan makeup but also in gender, age and ethnicity. The night marked a series of firsts. Ilhan Omar in Minnesota and Rashida Tlaib in Michigan will become the first Muslim women in the House. Sharice Davids in Kansas and Deb Haaland in New Mexico will become the first Native American women in the chamber. And Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a 29-year-old from New York, became the youngest woman elected to Congress.\n\nThey were part of a wave of female candidates on the Democratic side, including Jennifer Wexton, who easily unseated Rep. Barbara Comstock (R) in a closely watched race in Northern Virginia, and Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, who narrowly defeated Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R) in South Florida.\n\n\u201cThis resistance began with women and it is being led by women tonight,\u201d said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who easily won reelection and is widely expected to run for president in 2020.\n\nDemocrat Jared Polis in Colorado became the first openly gay man elected governor, while Democrat Janet Mills became the first female governor of Maine and Republican Kristi L. Noem will be the first female governor of South Dakota.\n\nRep. Mia Love, who was the sole black Republican woman in Congress, was trailing in Utah to Democrat Ben McAdams. Republicans were hoping that Young Kim, a Korean American woman, would win her California race to give the party some additional diversity.\n\nRepublican-held districts that Hillary Clinton carried in 2016 provided the backbone of the Democratic efforts to win the House majority. Democratic challengers triumphed in a number of suburban areas, defeating Republican Reps. Mike Coffman in suburban Denver, Kevin Yoder in the Kansas City area and David Brat in the Richmond suburbs, among others.\n\n[GRAPHIC: Live Senate midterm results]\n\nBut the Democratic momentum was not strong enough to carry some prized recruits over the finish line. Former Marine fighter pilot Amy McGrath, who attracted significant outside funding, lost to Rep. Andy Barr (R) in Kentucky.\n\nThe midterm elections had the energy of a presidential contest in their closing days, with Trump making himself the central figure and hoping to buck the historical trend of major losses for the president\u2019s party in the first midterm vote.\n\nIn an all-out push to preserve Republican congressional majorities, Trump dashed from one red state to the next, urging his legions of supporters that he calls \u201cthe silent majority\u201d to rush to the polls as if he were on the ballot.\n\nIn some ways, the outcome was eerily similar to that of 2016, with late polls overestimating the Democratic advantage in enthusiasm and Republicans showing unanticipated resilience thanks in part to Trump\u2019s incendiary rhetoric and focus on nativist themes.\n\nRacial tensions that had been simmering beneath the surface for years came to a boil in the final weeks of the campaign. Robo-calls in Georgia featured a voice impersonating Oprah Winfrey and calling Abrams \u201ca poor man\u2019s Aunt Jemima.\u201d In Florida, robo-calls mimicked Gillum as jungle sounds and chimpanzee noises were heard in the background.\n\nTrump called Gillum, the mayor of Tallahassee, \u201cnot equipped\u201d and Abrams, a leader in the state legislature, \u201cnot qualified\u201d to be governors. And Monday, all the major television networks rejected a Trump campaign advertisement about immigration, calling it offensive.\n\nThe racial overtones put that explosive form of politics on the ballot, with major stakes for Republicans. The party of Lincoln is now overwhelmingly white, while Democrats have a much more multiethnic coalition that represents the direction the country\u2019s demographics are heading.\n\nTrump closed the campaign on an exceptionally dark note, stoking long-standing national divides on race and culture and painting an apocalyptic and misleading vision of America under Democratic control as he barnstormed key Senate battlegrounds.\n\nRather than center his closing argument on the country\u2019s robust economic growth, Trump elected to highlight divisive nativist themes in a strategic gamble to energize his conservative base voters.\n\n[Trump readies 2020 campaign with no plans to change his approach]\n\nBecause of geographic fate, Democrats always faced an uphill climb in winning the two seats they needed to reclaim the Senate majority. A third of the nation\u2019s senators were up for reelection, including 10 Democratic incumbents running in states that Trump carried in 2016, many of them overwhelmingly. This year\u2019s map gave Republicans the clear advantage of running in conservative states where they had won for decades.\n\nAn outlier was Manchin, who secured reelection in West Virginia, which Trump won by 42 percentage points in 2016. He was helped by the independent profile he had cultivated back home, having previously served as governor and sometimes crossing the aisle to vote with Republicans. Manchin was the lone Democrat to vote to confirm Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh last month.\n\n\u201cWe made history tonight,\u201d Manchin said with a hoarse voice as he declared victory. \u201cNobody in the United States has ever won in a state that the president in the previous election won by 42 points in the opposite party. Never happened, never happened.\u201d\n\nIn Ohio, another state Trump carried two years ago, Sen. Sherrod Brown (D) cruised to reelection and cast his victory as a road map for Democrats to reclaim the industrial Midwest, though Republican Mike DeWine won the governorship there.\n\nIn two other Midwestern states that Trump won \u2014 Wisconsin and Michigan \u2014 Democrats fared better than they did in 2016. In Wisconsin, Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D) was reelected. And in Michigan, Sen. Debbie Stabenow won reelection and Democrat Gretchen Whitmer was elected governor.\n\nBut Democrats failed to win the governorships in a pair of deep-blue states. Republican Govs. Larry Hogan of Maryland and Charlie Baker of Massachusetts were reelected resoundingly.\n\nMeanwhile, voters in red states demonstrated notable willingness to back progressive policies, as Arkansas and Missouri voted for hikes in the minimum wage. Missouri voters also moved to legalize medical marijuana.\n\nRead more coverage:\n\nMidterm election live updates\n\nThink you\u2019ll know who won on election night?

Voters supporting Democrats for Congress are nearly three times as likely to mention the Republican Party than voters supporting Republicans (35 percent vs. 12 percent), while the Democratic Party is mentioned twice as often by those voting for Republicans, compared with those who support Democrats (34 percent vs. 17 percent).\n\nBut this dynamic of focusing on political opponents isn\u2019t as common among voters whose decisions Tuesday might swing the election as among those who say they are certain which party they will support.\n\nAmong voters who say they are \u201cprobably\u201d or \u201cleaning\u201d toward supporting Democrats, 23 percent mention the Republican Party in explaining their vote while a similar 19 percent mention Democrats. Voters who are leaning Republican are nine percentage points more likely to mention Democrats than Republicans \u2014 24 percent vs. 15 percent \u2014 though that is still smaller than the 26-point difference among voters who are definitely backing Republicans.\n\nAside from somewhat less criticism of political opponents, swing voters\u2019 reasons for their support tend to contain similar words and phrases to the electorate overall, as shown in the table below. But there are clear differences according to which party voters are leaning toward supporting.

The poll was conducted by SurveyMonkey among a sample of the millions of people who take an unrelated user-generated survey on the firm\u2019s platform, a non-probability sampling method of all U.S. registered voters. Analysis of open-ended survey responses used unweighted data. See here for more on SurveyMonkey\u2019s methodology.\n\nThe poll and analysis above are part of a collaboration between SurveyMonkey, The Washington Post and researchers at the University of Michigan and Georgetown University.

[Open-ended]", "In the final weeks of the midterm campaign, the Democratic Party has seen openings in a handful of districts that seemed out of reach, causing outside groups from both sides to race in at the last minute to try to tip things in their candidate\u2019s favor.\n\nIn these races, almost no outside money had been spent until they tightened at the very end, according to a review of campaign finance reports.\n\n[GRAPHIC: Where the money is going in the final push before Election Day]\n\nRepublicans are on the defensive this year, and infusing cash to save or take GOP-held seats in comfortably red districts has mostly not been a priority. For Democratic-leaning groups, throwing money into these races is a Hail Mary pass at the end of a game \u2014 worth the shot even if the odds are still long.\n\nIf these seats do flip, it is likely to be a very good night for Democrats.

Rep. Scott Perry (R), who has closely aligned himself with President Trump, is in a tighter-than-expected race against Democrat George Scott in a newly drawn district that, although still conservative, includes some purplish-blue areas. (Pennsylvania had to redraw its electoral map after a judge ruled that its district lines had been drawn for overt political gain.)\n\nOutside groups had spent about $400,000 on that race by mid-October. But sensing they could lose this reliable Republican seat, or in the Democrat\u2019s case, could win it, groups jumped in with a total of $2.1 million in the last weeks of the campaign to support and oppose Scott.\n\nVirginia\u2019s 5th District\n\nA similar dynamic occurred in Virginia\u2019s 5th Congressional District in the race to replace outgoing Rep. Thomas Garrett (R). Outside groups have spent $2.3 million, with $2.1 million of it coming at the tail end. A GOP leadership super PAC hurriedly went up on television for political newcomer Denver Riggleman when it became clear that the district \u2014 which Trump won by double digits \u2014 could not be taken for granted.\n\nHis opponent, Leslie Cockburn, was an investigative reporter and documentary filmmaker and is the mother of actress Olivia Wilde, which probably explains why Cockburn received $36,988 from the entertainment industry during the campaign.\n\nColorado\u2019s 6th District\n\nAnother significant shift in resources occurred in races that broke late for Democrats and where Republican groups decided to bow out and use their money elsewhere.\n\nIn Colorado\u2019s 6th District, the Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC aligned with the House GOP leadership, announced in late September that it was canceling $1 million worth of ad buys in support of Rep. Mike Coffman\u2019s reelection, plateauing the spending in the district for the Republican. About the same time, Democratic-leaning outside groups increased their spending by more than $2 million. In all, the groups supporting Democratic candidate Jason Crow have spent $10.4 million in the general-election campaign.\n\nTexas\u2019s 32nd District\n\nIn Texas\u2019s 32nd District, Democratic groups started spending at a faster clip in the last week of October, going big and dropping more than $2.2 million in the final few days to try to unseat Rep. Pete Sessions (R). Republican groups, on the other hand, have nearly stopped spending since Oct. 28.\n\nWith record turnout already in Texas, Sessions could also be hurt by the enthusiasm generated by Democratic Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, who is trying to unseat Sen. Ted Cruz (R).\n\nAlaska\u2019s at-large House district\n\nThe clearest example of a late push is actually the inverse of the overall trend.\n\nRep. Don Young (R) has held the job since 1973 and at 85 is the longest-serving member of the chamber, giving him the distinction of dean of the House. A fixture in the state, for most of his career he has won by double-digit margins. And yet this year, late polling suggested that the race was much closer than previously thought, so outside groups rushed in with their checkbooks. Young is one Republican who benefited more than his opponent from last-minute spending.\n\nBefore Oct. 15, there had been no outside money in Alaska\u2019s House race. But since then, independent groups have spent about $84,000, of which $75,000 came from the Congressional Leadership Fund in opposition to Alyse Galvin.\n\nMeanwhile, Galvin, a registered independent who ran in the Democratic primary, has received only about $7,900 in support from outside groups, and most of that came from Planned Parenthood.\n\nWant to dig in more to spending in this campaign?

(Tony Dejak/AP)\n\nOpinion writer\n\nThe last two major generic polls came in Monday, with CNN showing a 13-point lead (larger than virtually all other recent surveys) and George Washington University poll showing an 8-point lead for the same group of people surveyed twice before. Interestingly, GWU points to higher levels of engagement (e.g., signing a petition, making a donation, attending an event) for Democrats than for Republicans.\n\nThe polls have similar results to one important question: Does the voter approve or disapprove of President Trump\u2019s performance? Less than a third strongly approve (GWU 28 percent/CNN 30 percent), a small number somewhat approve (15/9) or somewhat disapprove (6/10) but a large plurality (47/45) strongly disapprove. Trump\u2019s dedicated followers represent a much smaller percentage of the electorate than his most ardent critics, which does raise a dilemma for Republicans. Trump, whom a strong plurality intensely dislikes, has told voters the midterms are all about him.\n\nThe Post reports:\n\nTrump [on Monday] framed the vote as a referendum on his presidency so far, pointing to several accomplishments but saying \u201cit\u2019s all fragile.\u201d \u201cIn a certain way, I am on the ballot,\u201d Trump said in a phone call with supporters. \u201cWhether we consider it or not, the press is very much considering it a referendum on me and us as a movement.\u201d\n\nFor once, Democrats are happy to agree. (\u201cAt a Northern Virginia campaign rally, former president Barack Obama said the election will define the soul of America, as other Democrats accused Trump of fearmongering.\u201d) What\u2019s more, Democrats such as Obama have elevated the midterms to a referendum not on some Trump policies but on what kind of country he wants. (\u201cThe character of this country is on the ballot. The politics we expect is on the ballot. How we conduct ourselves in public life is on the ballot\u201d). Making this about something greater than one issue, about the soul of America, gives voters some uplift at the end of a bitter campaign when voters want to feel good about their vote. Democrats are saying you can feel good \u2014 make that, noble \u2014 by casting a pro-democracy, pro-civility vote.\n\nMoreover, Trump is making quite clear what issue he thinks is critical. Trump not only nationalized the midterms, depriving candidates of the ability to make individualized appeals and focus on local interests; he did it on an issue \u2014 immigration \u2014 about which a large percentage of Americans disapprove of the president\u2019s handling. (CNN shows only 37 percent approve, 59 percent disapprove.) Rather than close on the economy, which most Americans consider a strong suit, he goes with immigration. Go figure. (One theory is that he is obsessed with pleasing his hardcore base which lives for his xenophobic rants; another is that it\u2019s the only issue on which he thinks he can pick up red states for the Senate, even if it adds to House losses elsewhere.)\n\nIn sum, Trump is reminding the plurality of the country why it disapproves so strongly and is reminding the somewhat approve/somewhat disapprove segments of the electorate why it might be a really good idea to have a check on Trump. (Are we really going to send thousands of troops and fire into a crowd?). Ironically, during the closing days of the 2016 election, Trump was remarkably contained and on message. Now, with his back to the wall, he\u2019s all fire and brimstone.\n\nSo yes, if Democrats rack up big wins, they can thank very good candidates, generous donors (who\u2019ve given record amounts in a midterm election) and the party\u2019s stars such as Obama, former vice president Joe Biden and Oprah Winfrey \u2014 but most all Trump. He made it all about him so Democrats didn\u2019t have to.\n\nRead more:\n\nWhat can we expect from the midterms?

Don\u2019t Beto on it.", "For decades, the United States has had voting turnout much lower than in most other developed nations. Between 50 and 60 percent of Americans tend to show up for presidential elections, and turnout often falls below 40 percent in midterm votes. The last midterms in 2014 were marked by particularly low participation, with a turnout of only 36.7 percent.\n\nThere are some indications that this year\u2019s turnout will be higher, probably driven up by deepened polarization that tends to mobilize voters.\n\nBut it is still likely that nonvoters will once again outnumber voters.\n\nMeanwhile, Belgium, Turkey and Australia have all had turnout rates of more than 80 percent in recent years. And while turnout can also be boosted by holding elections on weekends or automatically registering eligible voters, those three nations have something else in common: They have mandatory-voting laws.\n\nWhile mandatory-voting laws might be more symbolic in some nations, a lesson that is frequently echoed in all those countries is that higher turnouts also have a broader stimulating impact on political participation.\n\nAlthough Switzerland has no national legislation that forces citizens to vote, at least one region, or canton, requires residents to regularly head to the polls. Officials there say the law has resulted in more diverse and more active political debate, too.\n\n\u201cThe advantage of compulsory voting is that it is a gentle way of putting pressure on citizens to get more involved in political issues,\u201d senior regional official Stefan Bilger told Swiss public television during elections in 2014. And that\u2019s despite the fact that the canton\u2019s procedures are relatively lax compared to those in some other countries. If you are ill or out of town, you probably won\u2019t face a fine.\n\nIn Australia, meanwhile, not casting your ballot and refusing to pay a fine can land you in court.\n\nIn some of those nations, making voting a strictly enforced assignment rather than a right has historical origins. In Belgium and Australia, for example, requirements were introduced by parties weary of better-funded opponents that appeared more successful at mobilizing voters. Mandatory voting was a way to limit the influence of groups that may not represent the majority but were disproportionately well-organized.\n\nSimilar arguments led to the introduction of mandatory-voting laws in Latin America, where enforcement differs widely. Some nations enforce the laws by threatening civil servants with work bans or banking customers with transaction restrictions. In other places, punishments for failing to show up to vote exist only on paper.\n\nNot everyone is sad about that. \u201cOpponents of compulsory voting often contend that the country may be better off if those who are disinclined to vote are not pushed to participate in public affairs,\u201d University of Georgia researcher Shane P. Singh wrote in a recent analysis.\n\nAt least in Europe, the introduction of more compulsory-voting laws would probably benefit some political parties more than others. When ETH Zurich researchers examined the impact of compulsory voting in federal referendums, they were correct in anticipating a massive increase in participation \u2014 but with it also came more support for policies backed by left-wing candidates.\n\n\u201cThe increase in turnout resulted in a 20 percent increase in electoral support for leftist policy positions, most likely by mobilizing citizens at the bottom of the income distribution,\u201d the researchers concluded, based on historical data. (Overall, turnout increased by 30 percent.)\n\n\u201cAfter compulsory voting was abolished, increases in turnout and related forms [of] political participation both vanished immediately,\u201d they added.\n\nThe exact electoral impact may vary among nations, of course, as right-wing candidates may back positions often more associated with left-wing candidates, for instance. But the Swiss researchers' broader finding \u2014 that mandatory voting mobilizes groups of voters who would not otherwise cast their ballots \u2014 can be both exciting and disconcerting, depending on whom you support.\n\nMore on WorldViews:\n\n\u2018There should be music instead of the sound of bombs\u2019: How Mosul is using art to rebuild\n\nNigeria\u2019s army cited Trump\u2019s remarks to justify opening fire on protesters \u2014 then deleted the tweet\n\nFive arrests made after video mocking Grenfell Tower victims goes viral", "\n\nMuch of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland is imperceptible today. (Charles McQuillan/Getty Images)\n\nIt was \u201ca very sociable summer,\u201d the Derry Girls recall. As easy as the breeze, they crossed the largely invisible border into the Republic of Ireland, to visit family, or share a pint, or swim in the sea during the unseasonably warm weather.\n\n\u201cSo we all got to thinking how we take all this for granted \u2014 the freedom of it, the flow \u2014 and how it all could end,\u201d said Nicola Herron, 52, a local doctor who joined the group of like-minded women to pressure politicians to keep things just the way they are.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s scary, to be honest,\u201d said Elaine Doherty, 50, a psychologist and fellow activist in the campaign, which formally calls itself Derry Girls Against Borders. \u201cBrexit is just months away \u2014 and there\u2019s not a single person who can tell you what will happen to us.\u201d\n\nThe 310-mile border that cuts across the island of Ireland has become perhaps the single greatest impediment in the divorce negotiations between Britain and the European Union.\n\n\u201cA real sticking point,\u201d as British Prime Minister Theresa May put it.\n\nThe challenges loom over how to continue to allow for the free movement of people and trade between the Republic of Ireland, which will remain in the European Union, and Northern Ireland, which will leave along with the rest of the United Kingdom.\n\nAnd how to keep the border just as invisible, even as the U.K. and the E.U. inexorably diverge \u2014 each free to establish their own immigration controls, customs tariffs and food safety rules.\n\nAnd finally, how to do all this without upsetting the delicate peace in Northern Ireland that has relied on an open border.\n\nPeople north and south are quick to say there will be no returning to the \u201cTroubles\u201d \u2014 the vicious, intimate guerrilla war between pro-British Protestant unionists and Irish Catholic republicans that left more than 3,500 people dead.\n\nYet, sectarian lines remain deeply drawn in Northern Ireland. Many people in this border city \u2014 still known as Londonderry by Protestant residents and Derry by the 75 percent with Irish Catholic heritage \u2014 worry that a bungled Brexit could rekindle tensions and possibly lead to violence.\n\n\n\nThe activist group Derry Girls Against Borders has been protesting a hard division after Brexit. (Charles McQuillan/Getty Images)\n\nToday, driving along the Irish border, you might pass a farmer who has a barn in one country but grazes his sheep in the other. Almost 1 million people freely cross the squiggly line on the map each month. There are 200 official crossing points, and nobody knows how many dirt roads, foot trails and cow paths. The economies are tightly intertwined.\n\nBorder checkpoints, and all the militarized infrastructure of barracks, watchtowers, bunkers and blast walls, were removed from the island of Ireland in the aftermath of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, a hard-won pact that ended 30 years of violence. The deal was in many ways a masterpiece of diplomacy \u2014 it didn\u2019t seek to resolve all political differences in Northern Ireland but instead acknowledged the \u201ccontinuing, and equally legitimate, political aspirations\u201d of republicans and unionists.\n\nE.U. membership made such evasion possible. E.U. policies of free movement and free trade allowed Northern Irish republicans to feel more connected to the Republic of Ireland, while unionists could continue to be an integral part of the United Kingdom. No one had to choose. Lines, grievances, identities could begin to soften.\n\nBut after Brexit?\n\nRepublicans worry that a defined border on the island would undercut their relationship with the rest of Ireland. Leaders of Sinn Fein, the republican political party, have warned that any Brexit border would hasten the day they seek an island-wide vote to unify.\n\nBritish loyalists are livid about the E.U. proposal to place a customs border in the Irish Sea between Northern Ireland and Britain. May\u2019s governing partners, Northern Ireland\u2019s hard-line Democratic Unionist Party, oppose any kind of \u201cspecial status\u201d that would make them separate from the United Kingdom.\n\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk has blamed the Brexit campaigners, \u201cwho are 100% responsible for bringing back the problem of the Irish border,\u201d he said in a tweet.\n\nIn the 2016 referendum, 56 percent of Northern Ireland voters cast their ballots to remain in the European Union. In Derry, it was 78 percent.\n\n\u201cBrexit has re-politicized everything,\u201d said Jennifer McKeever, president of the Londonderry Chamber of Commerce and owner of a shuttle bus service with a third of its staff and customers living across the border.\n\nMay and her European counterparts have promised there will never again be a hard border on the island of Ireland. But what\u2019s a real-world and politically feasible alternative? They haven\u2019t said, because they don\u2019t know.\n\nMay vows that her negotiators in the transition period after Brexit begins in March will craft an unprecedented free-trade accord with Europe that makes an Irish border unnecessary.\n\nFailing that, the prime minister says, Britain will deploy a not-yet-invented \u201ctechnological fix\u201d \u2014 perhaps a system that employs cameras with facial recognition software, plus mobile tracking apps and customs checks in warehouses far from the border.\n\nNorthern Ireland\u2019s top police officer has warned that any customs posts or security installations would be viewed as \u201cfair game\u201d for attack.\n\n\u201cThe last thing we would want is any infrastructure around the border, because there is something symbolic about it and it becomes a target for violent dissident republicans,\u201d Chief Constable George Hamilton told the Guardian newspaper.\n\nPaddy Gallagher, 26, is a spokesman for a new fringe political party called Saoradh, which means \u201cliberation\u201d in Irish. The group is home to hard-line republicans who reject the Good Friday Agreement.\n\nGallagher concurred that \u201cany sign of a fixed border\u201d would quickly become a target. A remote camera recording license plates? A customs collector with bar-code scanner? \u201cCapable groups would be willing to attack them,\u201d said Gallagher, careful not to endorse violence himself.\n\nSaoradh\u2019s headquarters in Derry were raided in October by police anti-terrorism units, which confiscated 330 fireworks.\n\n\n\nThe Catholic Bogside neighborhood of Londonderry was the scene of the \u201cBloody Sunday\u201d killings in 1972. Recent protests have heightened anxiety about the potential for a return to violence. (Charles McQuillan/Getty Images)\n\nPeople here point to a disturbing week of violence this summer, sparked by unionist parades celebrating the \u201cTwelfth of July,\u201d the victory of Protestant Prince William of Orange over the deposed Catholic king James II in the Battle of the Boyne in 1690.\n\nAngry crowds in the Catholic Bogside neighborhood erected barricades to shut down streets. Although the protests were dismissed by many as \u201crecreational rioting\u201d by drunken mobs, more than 70 petrol bombs were hurled, alongside two pipe bombs thrown at police officers.\n\nThis civil unrest occurred on the same streets that were the backdrop of \u201cBloody Sunday,\u201d when British soldiers shot and killed 14 unarmed protesters at a civil rights march in 1972.\n\n\u201cIt was in Derry where the Troubles started, and it was in Derry where they ended, too,\u201d said Brenda Stevenson, 51, a former mayor here and the niece of the Irish leader John Hume, who shared a Nobel Peace Prize in 1998 for his role in ending the conflict.\n\n\n\nCatholics mourn the people shot dead by the British army on \u201cBloody Sunday\u201d in 1972.

Frustrated by British delays, the Europeans have insisted on a \u201cbackstop,\u201d a legally binding insurance policy, to preserve an Ireland without borders in the event that a free-trade deal eludes them.

(Steve Gonzales/Houston Chronicle via AP) (Associated Press)\n\nGALVESTON, Texas \u2014 NASA is monitoring how residents living near the Texas Gulf Coast react to quiet sonic booms as the space agency works on an experimental aircraft that could significantly reduce commercial flight times.\n\nNASA launched a two-week research project Monday on quiet supersonic research flights near Galveston, the Houston Chronicle reported. NASA is flying an F/A-18 jet in a unique maneuver over the Gulf of Mexico to assess the community\u2019s response to the noise.\n\nA spokesman said NASA officials hope the tests will produce data that can be used by the agency when testing the X-59 low boom flight demonstrator, the experimental aircraft it hopes could eventually reduce commercial flight times by half.\n\nThe Concorde, an airplane tested decades ago, could cross the Atlantic in just over three hours by traveling twice the speed of sound. But federal aviation officials banned it after residents complained about the plane\u2019s sonic boom.\n\nNASA recruited about 500 volunteers from the Galveston area to give feedback and define the level at which they were able to hear the sonic booms from the F/A-18. The project marks \u201cthe first time in decades that we have reached out to a large community as part of our supersonic research,\u201d said Peter Coen, NASA\u2019s commercial supersonic technology project manager.\n\nAtmospheric turbulence and humidity can affect how some areas perceive the \u201cquiet thumps\u201d made from the jet\u2019s special maneuver, according to NASA officials.\n\nNASA will provide the collected public response data to the Federal Aviation Administration. The FAA has banned supersonic passenger flights over land partly because of concerns about how they\u2019ll affect communities and infrastructure.\n\nSome Galveston residents posted on Facebook about the sonic booms on Monday, the first day of testing.\n\n\u201cI heard the \u2018quiet thump\u2019 this morning,\u201d resident Jeff Daniels wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely much better than a traditional sonic boom but I wouldn\u2019t want to listen to it all the time such as regular commercial air flights.

Old-school tiki rooms like Don the Beachcomber and Trader Vic\u2019s, Thomson will tell you, were among the first to employ Chinese chefs at white-tablecloth restaurants, forever sealing the connection between Americanized Chinese dishes and the tropical cocktails that define tiki culture.\n\nHad he more time, Thomson might do for you what he did for me one slow weekday night as I was perched on a bar stool: He handed me a copy of \u201cTrader Vic\u2019s Pacific Island Cookbook,\u201d a 1960s-era artifact in which Victor J. Bergeron, founder of the Polynesian-themed chain, reveals himself to be a fore\u00adfather to Anthony Bourdain (presumably minus the war zone and strip-club visits).\n\n[Anyone who picks a fight over tiki drinks\u2019 authenticity is missing the point]\n\nI realized I had a woefully incomplete picture of Bergeron. I mean, when viewed through our modern sensibilities, in all their wokeness, Trader Vic\u2019s can come across today as little more than an early cultural appropriator, a once-dominant restaurant empire that exoticized other cultures to titillate American diners. But Bergeron\u2019s cookbook lays out the deeper motivations behind Trader Vic\u2019s. It shares his stories from Tahiti to Texas (the book\u2019s subtitle is \u201cWith Side Trips to Hong Kong, Southeast Asia, Mexico, and Texas\u201d!), detailing Bergeron\u2019s fascination with countless international cuisines.\n\n\n\nOwen Thomson, left, and Ben Wiley, Archipelago\u2019s co-owners and chef-bartenders. (Dayna Smith/for The Washington Post)\n\nThe more you read, the more you realize that Bergeron was not a culinary tourist. The level of knowledge in his book could have come only from visiting kitchens, attending ceremonial feasts and talking to chefs. He demonstrated familiarity with, if not authority about, fermented black beans, Chinese five spice, Chinese barbecue pork and even monosodium glutamate, or MSG, which he wholeheartedly embraced as a flavor enhancer. He published a recipe for Barbecued Pig Chinese Style, in which the first direction is to \u201cselect a small pig, 18 to 20 pounds. Remove most of the shoulder bones and split the chine bone down the back from the inside, taking care not to cut the outer skin.\u201d\n\nThis guy was not a dilettante. Bergeron was a true believer. But he was also a realist who knew that 1960s America was not yet ready for authentic Chinese cooking, even if chefs could find the ingredients they needed (which they largely couldn\u2019t). \u201cChinese dishes are very popular in this country,\u201d Bergeron wrote, \u201cbut there are many which if served exactly as they were originally created, simply wouldn\u2019t be accepted.\u201d\n\n[Sichuan and Shaanxi cuisines get a beautiful new showcase in Rockville]\n\nIn some ways, Thomson and Ben Wiley have inherited the mantle from Bergeron. The co-owners of Archipelago (Joe Ambrose is also a partner) are bartenders by training, experience and reputation. But now they also serve as chefs at their tiki bar, though they\u2019re loath to call themselves such. They\u2019re too modest \u2014 and too friendly with professionally trained toques who might bristle at bartenders who adopt the title of \u201cchef.\u201d\n\n\n\nEven lights carry the tiki theme. (Dayna Smith/For The Washington Post)\n\nThe banana daiquiri. (Dayna Smith/For The Washington Post)\n\nRegardless, Wiley and Thomson \u2014 like Bergeron before them \u2014 have an insatiable curiosity. They entered the bartending world through a back door. Both were schooled in other fields: Wiley has an undergraduate degree in history and Thomson in archaeology. Thomson even has a law degree that he\u2019s never used. As you\u2019d expect, their thirst for knowledge didn\u2019t stop just because they decided to sling drinks for a living. They\u2019ve channeled their skills into researching and developing a menu that bows respectfully in the direction of China, while making modifications that befit their tiki bar concept.\n\nThe mapo tofu offers a fine example: The blocks of firm tofu do not come swimming in Sichuan chile oil, as they would at Xi\u2019an Gourmet or some other spot, but instead are mixed with Chinese broccoli and scallions and then sprinkled atop a bowl of white rice that serves as a sponge for the spicy-and-numbing oil. It\u2019s a brilliant, bar-friendly interpretation. But even when the Sichuan oil assumes a role more central to the dish \u2014 as it does in the appetizer of pork wontons in red oil \u2014 the sauce is mindful of its audience. It purrs more than growls.\n\nThomson and Wiley make almost everything in-house, including the pork-and-tofu lion\u2019s head meatballs (garlicky little orbs drizzled with hoisin aioli), kung pao wings (a bar classic reimagined as potent Sichuan finger food) and even the Sichuan oil (which leans harder on the sweet cinnamon and star anise than the anesthetic Sichuan peppercorns and chile flakes). One of the fiercest items on the menu is the hot chicken steam buns, a clever and nuclear Taiwanese take on Nashville hot chicken. Make sure to have a mai tai at your elbow.\n\n\n\nBartender Katie Dahl lights the drink Pineapple of Hospitality for Alexander Prucha and Emily Goodwin. (Dayna Smith/For the Washington Post)\n\nAlthough the menu lumps every dish under a general \u201cfood\u201d heading, some plates are clearly designed as appetizers and others as entrees. In the former category, the Sichuan eggplant won\u2019t be mistaken for Peter Chang\u2019s signature dry-fried eggplant dish; this one plays to the nightshade\u2019s softer and silkier textures, different but delicious. The Xi\u2019an spiced potatoes is another appetizer, sort of like Chinese skillet potatoes, but heavy on cumin and paired with a black-vinegar aioli dipping sauce.\n\nThe dan dan noodles approach entree status, each thick, toothsome strand almost painted with chile oil and topped with an un\u00ador\u00adtho\u00addox ground-beef mixture that substitutes for the traditional crumbled pork. The dish has a pine-needle coolness that somehow suits the Day-Glo, palm-tree aesthetic of this place. The black soy bean chicken, by contrast, has heft, a bowl that believes in the power of fermentation to ratchet up a dish\u2019s savory qualities. I could have eaten three orders of it.\n\nOne thing to consider about Archipelago: It is a bar of many personas. One night, it could be a mosh pit of tiki tipplers. The next, it could be a tropical dead zone, just you and the bartender discussing the finer points of aged rums and tiki glassware. Personally, I prefer the quiet nights, not because I enjoy watching a bar suffer, but because I can listen to Thomson and Wiley as they quietly step into their roles as tiki archivists. Before you know, you might have an old cookbook or a Trader Vic\u2019s menu from the 1980s sitting in front of you. Either one pairs perfectly with a banana daiquiri.", "Ivanka Trump-branded semiconductors and voting machines? In China?\n\nThat\u2019s an odd, if remote, possibility after Chinese trademark regulators awarded preliminary approval for 16 trademark applications from the president\u2019s daughter and White House senior adviser, online Chinese government filings show.\n\nThe approvals by Beijing on Oct. 13 were notable for their timing, coming just as Chinese and U.S. officials were seeking to restart trade talks that had collapsed amid acrimony. They also raised eyebrows for covering a grab-bag of products, including electoral hardware in a country not exactly known for its elections.\n\nEthics watchdogs have long warned about the possibility of foreign governments seeking to curry favor with President Trump through his family\u2019s extensive business interests, and Ivanka Trump appeared to acknowledge the potential for conflict in her dual roles as White House official and international entrepreneur in July, when she shut down her namesake fashion line.\n\nThe approvals are a reminder of the Chinese government\u2019s knack for making uncannily timed decisions when it comes to Trump family businesses \u2014 even if it\u2019s just coincidence, as Chinese experts say.\n\nThe October decisions were the largest batch of approvals for Ivanka Trump since her father entered the White House, and they came as he was locked in a trade standoff with China, according to Caroline Zhang of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics (CREW) in Washington, who first pointed out the updated filings.\n\n\u201cSince she has retained her foreign trademarks, the public will continue to have to ask whether President Trump has made foreign policy decisions in the interest of his and his family\u2019s businesses,\u201d Zhang wrote.\n\nThe approvals were granted 2 1/ 2 years after Ivanka Trump\u2019s company applied, far longer than the average processing time of a year or less, said Hao Junbo, a trademark lawyer at the Hao Law Firm in Beijing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to rule out political factors because the approval period indeed took quite long, and the timing of it came just right,\u201d Hao said, referring to the premise that Beijing made a conciliatory gesture after trade frictions took a marked turn for the worse in September.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand,\u201d Hao added, \u201cthere\u2019s no evidence of anything unusual. With these matters, you could never confirm one narrative or another.\u201d\n\nPeter Mirijanian, a spokesman for Abbe Lowell, Ivanka Trump\u2019s ethics attorney, said the applications were filed well before her father\u2019s election victory.\n\n\u201cThese trademarks were sought to broadly protect Ms. Trump\u2019s name, and to prevent others from stealing her name and using it to sell their products,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a common trademark practice, which is why the trademark applications were granted.\u201d\n\nGiven the scattershot nature of the applications, the 16 bids that China greenlighted in October gave Ivanka Trump a foothold in a sprawling number of markets. She is now poised to hold trademarks for senior homes and veterinary services, as well as for batteries, wedding gowns and sausage casings.\n\nAll told, China has approved more than 30 of her trademark applications.\n\nJordan Libowitz of CREW, the ethics watchdog, said the group\u2019s data showed that some Ivanka Trump applications have taken even longer to process.\n\n\u201cWe obviously do not know the reason behind the timing, although some others have suspiciously lined up with events involving the Trump administration,\u201d Libowitz said.\n\nIn May, China awarded Ivanka Trump seven trademarks around the same time that President Trump worked to save a Chinese state-owned telecom equipment maker when it was on the verge of going bust from U.S. sanctions. Last year, Ivanka Trump\u2019s clothing line received three trademarks on the same day she dined with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the president\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate.\n\nAnd in a rare move, China reversed its decision to reject nine Donald Trump trademarks last year, the Associated Press found.\n\nWhen Ivanka Trump shut down her brand in July, a person familiar with the situation told The Washington Post that company lawyers intended to continue seeking trademarks in China to protect her name from exploitation.\n\nEthics experts argued that the moves would lay the groundwork for Ivanka Trump to pursue lucrative business opportunities in China after her father leaves office. They said this poses conflicts of interest for the White House regardless of whether she is stepping away from her company.\n\nWhatever Ivanka Trump\u2019s motives, Charles Feng, a lawyer at East & Concord Partners in Beijing, said the practice of \u201ctrademark squatting\u201d \u2014 firms applying for valuable trademarks with tenuous or nonexistent connections to the name \u2014 is real in China, and highly widespread.\n\nThe Trump family\u2019s dealings with foreign governments have come under heavy scrutiny since Trump entered the White House.\n\nTwo federal lawsuits allege that Trump violated the Constitution\u2019s emoluments clause, which bars presidents from taking payments from foreign states without Congress\u2019s consent.\n\nTo allow the cases to proceed, the presiding judges referenced business that foreign governments have done with Trump\u2019s company, which he resigned from but did not divest himself of when he became president.\n\nForeign governments including Bahrain and Malaysia have booked business at the Trump\u2019s International Hotel in the District, where Ivanka Trump is one of the owners. A state-backed Chinese construction firm has been hired for infrastructure work on a Trump-branded golf development in Dubai.\n\nJustice Department attorneys have argued in both legal cases that the president did not receive any emoluments and that the suits should be dismissed.\n\nBoth cases were brought by elected Democrats teamed with legal advocacy groups, including CREW. Congressional Democrats have repeatedly said that, if they win control of the House or Senate, they plan to launch investigations into the Trump Organization.\n\nOther Trump business dealings have prompted civil suits, including an action brought last week by four anonymous plaintiffs who claim they were defrauded by a marketing company Trump promoted.\n\nA government database shows that more than 500 trademark applications have been made with either Ivanka Trump\u2019s name in Roman letters or Chinese characters. The real Ivanka Trump submitted 53 of the applications, records show, while Chinese companies and individuals lodged the rest.\n\nMost of those poured in during the early months of President Trump\u2019s term, when the unorthodox president and his family became the subject of fascination on Chinese social media.\n\nThose applicants for Ivanka trademarks include farm equipment manufacturers, asset managers, electronics makers and biotechnology firms. An investment adviser in eastern China and a Beijing weight-loss company submitted 20 applications \u2014 each \u2014 to use her name. A financial company wanted to register \u201cIvankarabella,\u201d a mash-up of the names of Ivanka Trump and her daughter.\n\n\u201cThe squatters are really a problem in China, and the authorities get a ton of applications every day,\u201d said Feng, the lawyer with East and Concord Partners. \u201cBut they have a lot of authority and flexibility over how they approve them.\u201d\n\nLyric Li contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:\n\nIvanka Trump shuts down her namesake clothing brand\n\n\u2018Where is Ivanka?\u2019 First Daughter seeks control in dual role in White House\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "MOSCOW \u2014 A Moscow court has arrested a 14-year-old boy believed to be linked to a bomb attack at a local branch of Russia\u2019s main intelligence agency in a northern city last week.\n\nThe court on Tuesday ruled to keep behind bars the teenage Moscow resident, whose name is not disclosed because he is underage.

Washington is the first American city to offer the multiplayer program, which has prompted gamers to travel as far as four hours for the five-minute whirl on the racetrack, according to Nick Iftner, a sales and support specialist with Bandai Namco.\n\n[Does Georgetown Cupcake really have the best cupcakes in D.C.? We tested seven shops to find out.]\n\nA Nintendo fan, I had to try it out and brought a friend to join. The first challenge: locating the actual arcade within Union Station.

Reservations aren\u2019t required, but you\u2019ll have to pay with a card to snag a seat at the racetrack.\n\nOnce we spotted the arcade, we discovered four seats that corresponded with some of Mario Kart\u2019s classic characters: Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach and Yoshi. (Iftner said Mario and Yoshi are the most popular.)\n\nLike most arcade racers, the seats came with a built-in steering wheel and pedals. Before we could rev our engines, we were outfitted with a VR headset, headphones and hand-strapped trackers to detect and reflect our movements.\n\nAfter I made my character choice (Mario) and got strapped in with the gear, I had a minute to look around, adjust to my new virtual surroundings and admire my new bulbous hands.\n\n\u201cAs soon as we put on our headsets and entered the world, we had the same collective reaction,\u201d says Gerard Massey, a 30-year-old IT contractor and fellow gamer. \u201cWe all started giggling like children.\u201d\n\nThen we were off to the races. As soon as I hit the accelerator, my seat jolted forward and a stream of cool air hit my face. Soon I was flying through the arena, making hairpin turns to dodge hungry Piranha Plants and thwart angry Thwomp cinder blocks.\n\nI had to \u201cgrab\u201d power-ups with my hands \u2014 think floating green turtle shells and balloons \u2014 and lob them in the direction of my opponents, which was just as fun as it sounds. It was also an entertaining sight for onlookers. The aggressive hand movements looked like a hybrid of a Jersey Shore fist pump and a mechanical-bull move.\n\nThe racers are able to communicate via headsets, which led to some lighthearted ribbing and trash talk. When Luigi launched a banana peel in my direction, causing my car to spin out, my seat rattled and vibrated. I returned the favor by bludgeoning his with a giant red hammer.\n\n[5 creative twists on French toast you should try this weekend]\n\nBefore I knew it, the race was over.

My advice: Skip both and save the money for another round of Mario Kart.\n\nJust make sure to soak in as much as you can of the Mushroom Kingdom \u2014 the experience is quick (4 minutes, 45 seconds) and a tad expensive ($10 a game).

We learned other things as well:\n\nVoters are less concerned with ideological purity than pundits and pols think;\n\nDemocracy is more frail than we imagined, and it relies to a large extent on unwritten norms and habits of mind;\n\nParty and tribe can sublimate the Framers\u2019 best-laid plans for divided government, and checks and balances;\n\nVoter fraud is rare, but efforts to extend white dominance in the electorate by voter suppression are common; and\n\nThe free press and independent courts may be the most essential aspects of our democracy.\n\nMore than 5,000 presidential lies later, we are ready to see if the electorate shifted in some permanent ways in 2016 or whether 2016 was a perfect storm, an aberration and a wake-up call. The perfect storm explanation for 2016 would say that a poor presidential candidate, a complacent Democratic base, a TV celebrity candidate and a last-minute intrusion into the election campaign by FBI Director James B. Comey produced a narrow victory for President Trump, a result few expected, including the candidate. The permanent-shift explanation is that Americans demand entertainment from politics, dismiss (or even embrace) racism and misogyny, and are indifferent about the survival of democracy. They want someone to break the furniture and don\u2019t much care how he does it or what he says.\n\nHere then are five questions, the answers to which will help clarify whether 2016 was closer to the perfect storm or a harbinger of a permanent shift, one that reveals democracy\u2019s decay:\n\nWhat is the final turnout? Early voting was off the charts. \u201cWith just over 24 hours until the first polls close, more than 35 million Americans have already voted in the 2018 midterm elections,\u201d according to Medium.com, in a post citing data from Target Early, which tracks early voting. \u201cOf those who have already voted, more than 1.5 million are new registrants who have never voted before and 6 million are infrequent voters. These two groups are seeing a .92% and 4.17% growth in total vote share, respectively, over the 2014 midterms. By comparison, the share of early vote among voters most-likely to turn out (\u201csuper voters\u201d) are down a significant 8.35 percent. The number of voters who have never voted or are infrequent votes has more than doubled compared to 2014.\u201d If early voting didn\u2019t merely cannibalize Election Day voting but grew the electorate in a significant way, it is a good sign that Americans got a wake-up call in 2016 and value the most fundamental aspect of citizenship, voting. Does voter suppression and racist rhetoric win elections? In Georgia and North Dakota, we saw deliberate efforts to dissuade African Americans and Native Americans, respectively, from voting. The racial composition of the electorate will be of great interest, as will any evidence that voter suppression triggered a backlash not only among nonwhite voters but also among independents and moderates. Trump\u2019s two-week long racist rant and scare tactics about the caravan were meant to stir the base. We don\u2019t have a \u201ccontrol group\u201d to measure against the election, but if the House flips, the suburbs go Democratic and/or known race-baiters such as Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) lose, we will have some evidence, however imperfect, that such tactics are not only morally wrong but politically ineffective. Will 2018 really be the year of the woman? Trump won in 2016 even after the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape and myriad women accusing him of unwanted sexual conduct surfaced. He insulted women regularly, and frequently remarked on their looks and (low) intelligence. According to the Center for Women and Politics at Rutgers University, 237 women are running for the House (the vast majority, Democrats), 23 for the Senate and 16 for governor. One measure of the revulsion over Trump\u2019s treatment of women and the Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh hearings, as well as the wider #MeToo movement, will be the number of women elected. Another measure will be the gender gap and specifically whether women who have traditionally voted Republican (e.g. white college-educated women) vote Democratic. Is the electoral map back to \u201cnormal\u201d? When Trump won Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, Republicans crowed that they\u2019d broken the Democrats\u2019 grip on the Midwest. A cottage industry of consultants told Democrats they had to appeal to white men, even at the expense of traditionally Democratic groups. All four of these states have a Senate race and a governor\u2019s race. If Democrats win most of these, 2016 looks more like that perfect storm and not a permanent shift. Have Republicans lost the suburbs by following an irrational, racist president? The House majority will turn in large part on those suburban districts that voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016 but for Republicans for the House, and/or that voted for Barack Obama in 2012 but went for Trump in 2016. If the frenetic, chaotic presidency, the nonstop lying, the failure of adult leadership and oversight, the racism and the sexism provoke the suburbs (with women leading the way) to switch parties, we may see a wholesale realignment in our politics.\n\nWe are reminded once more that victories in American politics are not permanent, and the country and its politics are far more fluid than many pundits and pols think. After the 2018 votes are counted, we\u2019ll have gained some perspective regarding the 2016 election \u2014 and perhaps how Trumpism can finally be routed.\n\nRead more:\n\nWhat can we expect from the midterms?

(Kabir Dhanji/Associated Press)\n\nANTANANARIVO, Madagascar \u2014 Voters in Madagascar will go to the polls Wednesday to elect a president with hopes that a new leader will take this Indian Ocean island nation out of chronic poverty and corruption.\n\nThe 36 candidates have all promised to improve the country\u2019s economy, create new jobs and end graft, but the three leaders in the race are familiar faces who offer little chance of a dramatic change, according to political analysts.\n\nThe winning candidate must take more than 50 percent of the votes cast and with such a large number running, it is likely the race will go to a second round, scheduled for Dec. 19.\n\nThe leading candidates are three former presidents - Marc Ravalomanana, Andry Rajoelina and Hery Rajaonarimampianina - and for weeks have been campaigning by flying across the island by helicopter to address rallies.\n\nHery Rajaonarimampianina, 59, stepped down as president in September in order to campaign and left the country to be run by the president of the senate. He said he needs another term to improve Madagascar\u2019s economy.\n\n\u201cWhen I arrived in 2014, the extreme poverty rate was 92 percent,\u201d he said at a rally last week. \u201cAll cannot be done in a day, there are many projects that can only be realized in the long term.\u201d\n\nFormer president Marc Ravalomanana, 68, was forced to resign by the military in 2009 has always promised his supporters that he will return to power.\n\n\u201dI promised you that I will come back to date. Nine years later, it\u2019s time,\u201d he said. He vowed to improve Madagascar\u2019s economy so that ordinary citizens will be able to live better.\n\nAndry Rajoelina, 44, was brought to power in 2009 by the military and ruled for an interim period. He promises to end corruption.\n\nA fourth former president, Didier Ratsiraka, 81, is also running but he is not considered likely to win the ballot.\n\nWith an estimated 76 percent of its 25 million people in extreme poverty, Madagascar is one of the world\u2019s poorest countries, according to the World Bank.\n\n\u201dThis election ... an opportunity for the people to choose a new president who, we hope, will be able to recover the country and to defeat its most persistent demons: poverty, corruption, impunity, bad governance,\u201d said Ketakandriana Rafitoson, the director of Transparency International\u2019s Madagascar branch. \u201cUnfortunately, this looks bad because those who are likely to win these elections are the specialists and sources of these vices mentioned above.

Ryan (R-Wis.) speaks during a news conference in which he faced questions about Republicans' American Health Care Act. (Michael Reynolds/EPA)\n\nIt\u2019s been 18 months since House Democrats broke out into a taunting song as Republicans voted to pass their unpopular Obamacare repeal-and-replace bill.\n\n\u201cNah-nah-nah-nah. Hey, hey, hey. Goodbye,\u201d the Democrats sang from one end of the House chamber, facing their GOP colleagues on the other end.\n\nToday we\u2019ll find out whether their tune was prophetic.\n\nDemocrats could seize the House majority for the first time in eight years as Americans head to the polls for the midterm elections. If Democrats manage to flip that chamber, it will be on the heels of a campaign season in which they unrelentingly \u2014 and seemingly effectively \u2014 blasted Republicans for spending much of 2017 trying to ditch the Affordable Care Act and its patient protections.\n\nYou could put it this way: After years of winning elections by promising to get rid of Obamacare, Republicans might now lose because they followed through on that promise (though their bid ultimately failed in the Senate.)\n\n\u201cLook, opposition is a lot easier,\u201d Brad Woodhouse, a veteran Democratic political operative who now heads the group Protect Our Care, told me. \u201cWhen Republicans started coming after benefits that people enjoy, it was pretty easy to point the finger.\u201d\n\nWoodhouse said the Democratic strategy to prioritize health care -- especially protections for preexisting conditions -- was the subject of \u201cconsiderable debate\u201d among Democrats and activists in the aftermath of the 2016 elections. In those conversations, a consensus emerged that candidates would stay away from attacking Trump and his personality and instead keep the focus on GOP-led policies.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made it about their sabotage, their repeal agenda,\u201d Woodhouse said. \u201cWe\u2019ve kept the focus on them.\u201d\n\nThis was precisely the strategy advanced by the Hub Project, a Democratic organization led by Leslie Dach, who also serves as campaign chair of Protect Our Care. The Hub Project is spending nearly $30 million of so-called \"dark money\" on trying to flip vulnerable Republican seats with focused attacks on their votes around health-care and taxes, per a report by the New York Times's Alexander Burns.\n\n\"The quiet onslaught embodied two of the most important strategic choices by Democrats in the 2018 elections \u2014 putting health care and taxes at the core of their message, and using invigorated fund-raising on the left to challenge Republicans even in conservative-leaning areas,\" Alexander writes.\n\nDemocrats previously had trouble selling other parts of the ACA to the public. But protections for people with preexisting conditions were always the most popular part of the bill, which polling confirms.\n\nPatients have also had access to Obamacare for four years now -- making the law's benefits harder to take away as more and more insurance plans are complying with the ACA. And even though Republican lawmakers ran for years on a repeal-and-replace agenda, it seems the actual act of voting to repeal the law opened them up to a political fight they may not have been able to win.\n\nRepublicans seemed to recognize the danger, running plenty of ads seeking to assure voters they would fight to retain preexisting conditions, even if they opposed keeping Obamacare. And Democrats sometimes went too far in exaggerating what their repeal effort would have done to undermine protections for patients.\n\nBut the message became crystal clear to voters, anyway.\n\n\u201cIf you have a credible threat against preexisting condition protections, then you have a very winnable fight,\u201d said Chris Jennings, who served as a health policy adviser to both Obama and Bill Clinton.\n\nJennings and Woodhouse told me that as Democrats looked at the polling data and ran focus groups, the party organizations, congressional leaders and outside activists came to an agreement that preexisting conditions should be their chief message in the midterm elections.\n\n\u201cIt really started to unify Democrats and it was pollsters, strategists, Obama people behind the scenes and others,\u201d Jennings said. \u201cDemocratic leadership was very, very much involved in the organization of this, as well as Protect Our Care \u2026 it was a very tight group of people.\u201d\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), in a letter yesterday, urged House Democrats to keep focusing on health care in their final hours of campaigning.\n\n\u201cI urge all of us to continue to push this message in the next 24 hours,\u201d Pelosi wrote. \u201cHealth care is the key factor in voters\u2019 decisions.\u201d\n\nRep. Tom MacArthur (R-N.J.) is in a tough race after supporting the American Health Care Act. (Cliff Owen/AP)\n\nThe potency of the Democratic message is demonstrated by the political danger in which Republicans who were involved in the negotiations to pass the House GOP bill find themselves. Some of them are in serious danger of losing their seats.\n\nIt's made worse by the fact that a similar measure to the House bill -- known as the American Health Care Act (AHCA ) -- failed in the Senate, meaning Republicans are on record voting against something they didn't manage to defeat.\n\nRep. Tom MacArthur (R-N.J.), who put himself on the line to get the House GOP bill approved, is fighting for his political life. So is Rep. Fred Upton (R-Mich.), who also became a key figure when he announced his opposition to the AHCA, citing concerns it would erode preexisting condition protections. Upton ultimately came back on board after persuading the GOP leadership to tack on an additional $8 billion to help cover people hurt in states that got waivers.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just moderate Republicans in tough races. Reps. Dave Brat (R-Va.) and Scott Perry (R-Pa.), members of the House Freedom Caucus, are also endangered. They and other hard-line conservatives were a lot more worried about lifting Obamacare requirements than about retaining its consumer protections.\n\nPerhaps reflecting how nervous Republicans feel about today\u2019s elections, Trump and his staff have been even more insistent in recent weeks that they\u2019re not doing anything to hurt people with preexisting conditions \u2014 even though the Justice Department is refusing to defend the ACA against a state-led lawsuit.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders:\n\n.@PressSec: \u201cThe president\u2019s been clear. Whatever policy he puts forth on health care, it will protect pre-existing conditions.\u201d @foxandfriends pic.twitter.com/ebNNZuUO2w \u2014 Fox News (@FoxNews) November 5, 2018\n\nIn the end, Congressional Republicans served themselves up a double whammy on health care. They didn\u2019t manage to repeal Obamacare because the Senate fell one vote short. And, their votes for the AHCA opened the door to an aggressive offensive by Democrats. More than 50 percent of Democratic campaign ads from mid-September to mid-October mentioned health care, and the GOP bid to take away preexisting conditions was the chief refrain among those, as my colleague Paul Kane notes.\n\nIndeed, the GOP's effort to repeal and replace Obamacare turned health-care politics upside down to an extraordinary degree. After years of being forced to defend Obamacare\u2019s shortcomings, Democrats have managed to shift the focus from its unpopular parts (such as its mandate to buy coverage) to its most popular provision, its the preexisting conditions protections.\n\n\u201cRepublican House and Senate members (bless their hearts) couldn\u2019t figure out how to repeal and replace the ACA convincingly or successfully, but they did manage to achieve the near-impossible: Make the law popular!,\u201d wrote Tom Miller, a health-care expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.\n\nAHH, OOF and OUCH\n\nIn this July 30, 2015 file photo, a sign supporting Medicare is seen on Capitol Hill in Washington.

By 2002, the GOP advantage among retiree donors had declined to 63% versus 36%. Eight years later, the split was 55%-44%.\u201d\n\nLeoni Kahumbu, mother of Pascaline, a 15-year-old who was infected with Ebola shows the bed where she first notice signs of Ebola on her daughter, in Beni, Democratic Republic of Congo. (AP Photo/Al-hadji Kudra Maliro)\n\nOOF: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is warning of the possibility that the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo is not containable.\n\nEbola could instead become entrenched in the region, our Post colleague Lena H. Sun reports. \u201cIf that happens, it would be the first time since the deadly viral disease was first identified in 1976 that an Ebola outbreak leads to persistent presence of disease,\u201d she writes. \u201cIn all previous outbreaks, most of which took place in remote areas, the disease was contained before it spread widely. The current outbreak is entering its fourth month, with nearly 300 cases, including 186 deaths.\u201d\n\nThe consequence would mean the deadly virus would spread unpredictably. CDC Director Robert Redfield and other health experts say one of the major concerns is if Ebola spreads to major trade regions where \u201cthe risk of widespread transmission escalates dramatically.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe outbreak is taking place in a part of Congo that is an active war zone,\" Lena writes. \"Dozens of armed militias operate in the area, attacking government outposts and civilians, complicating the work of Ebola response teams and putting their security at risk. Violence has escalated in recent weeks, severely hampering the response. The daily rate of new Ebola cases more than doubled in early October. \u201d\n\n\u201cIn addition, there is community resistance and deep mistrust of the government. Some sick people have refused to go to treatment centers, health-care workers are still being infected, and some people are dying of Ebola or spreading the virus to new areas.\u201d\n\nMcKenzie Anderson has a mysterious disease called acute flaccid myelitis. (Courtesy of the Anderson family)\n\nOUCH: Doctors are struggling to explain the third nationwide peak since 2014 of the rare polio-like condition, acute flaccid myelitis.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is investigating 219 reports of patients with the disease so far this year, with 80 of those cases confirmed to be AFM. That\u2019s up from 33 confirmed cases last year, the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Sumathi Reddy reports. The spikes in cases have come every two years since 2014 and have almost always been in children.\n\nThe CDC confirmed 149 cases in 2016 and 120 cases in 2014.\n\n\u201cDoctors and the CDC differ on the possible cause of the condition and how to treat it,\u201d Sumathi writes. \u201cMany doctors speculate AFM is largely fueled by a common virus called the enterovirus, which for most people causes nothing more than a routine upper-respiratory infection. But the CDC believes there could be other culprits. Some experts believe the condition likely existed before 2014 and think there could be more cases, since there is no national requirement to report as there is for many other conditions, including influenza and measles.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf there was mandatory reporting, it would help with surveillance,\u201d Keith Van Haren, an assistant professor of neurology at the Stanford University School of Medicine, told Sumathi. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t appear to be going away. We need to be preparing and anticipating the possibility of a more severe outbreak.\u201d\n\nSTATE SCAN\n\nStates have approved a number of medical and recreational marijuana programs over the past 20 years. (Washington Post) (Illustration by Kate Rabinowitz for The Washington Post)\n\n\u2014 Our Post colleague Christopher Ingraham has another helpful look at all the marijuana initiatives on the ballot today and where they are most likely to win.\n\nHe writes that the latest polls show Michigan\u2019s measure on recreational marijuana use passing with a comfortable margin.\n\nAs for Nebraska\u2019s measure on legalizing recreational pot, he writes the polling is \u201call over the place, with two surveys fielded at roughly the same time in October yielding opposite, lopsided results: One showed the initiative passing 51 percent to 36 percent, while the other showed it failing with 65 percent opposed. With numbers like those, it\u2019s hard to predict how this one will shake out.\u201d\n\nIn Missouri, where there are three separate medical marijuana initiatives, polling has been \u201cscant,\u201d Christopher writes, \u201cbut a survey in August showed that voters supported, in general terms, an amendment to the state constitution that would legalize medical marijuana. If two or more of the measures pass, it\u2019s likely that the measure that receives the most votes will go into effect.\u201d\n\nAnd in Utah, he reports the \u201ceventual result is essentially a foregone conclusion\u201d because of the compromise struck between both sides on the measure in the state.\n\nRead more on these measures on the ballot from The Health 202 here.\n\nMaine Gov.

If a number cannot be verified, messenger services are required to block users from their platforms.\n\nThe Russian government will also require network operators to keep track of which messenger apps their users have registered for. The decree goes into effect after 180 days.\n\nOver the past few years, Russia has adopted legislation aimed at curtailing internet freedom and limiting data privacy. One of the laws requires mobile phone operators to store data on voice calls and messages for several months. Other legislation allows authorities to target activists by fining and even sending them to prison for social media posts.\n\nIn April, Russian authorities sought to block Telegram over its refusal to hand over keys to its data encryption. Telegram, which was developed by Russian entrepreneur Pavel Durov, had refused to share data. In a battle to cripple Telegram\u2019s operations, the Russian communications watchdog blocked some servers owned by tech giants Google and Amazon, affecting millions of Russian websites.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Adrian Kraus/Associated Press)\n\nThe notes on individual players in this space have tended to focus on those most highly ranked, because they are the most widely owned and thus of interest to the largest proportion of readers. As a corollary, there have been few notes on members of the Bills in this space, because they have tended to be nowhere near the upper, or even middle, echelons of the rankings.\n\nSo let\u2019s take a moment and have a look at Buffalo, shall we? If only to, you know, marvel at what a fantasy Rust Belt it has been.\n\nThe Bills' 41-9 loss last week to the Bears marked the fifth time this season they\u2019ve been held to single digits in scoring. With a quarterbacking carousel of Josh Allen, Derek Anderson and the incomparably awful Nathan Peterman, plus a subpar offensive line, it\u2019s little wonder that LeSean McCoy has been a bust, to say nothing of the, well, nothing-burgers that overly optimistic fantasy drafters have received from the likes of Kelvin Benjamin and Charles Clay.\n\nIn fact, the only fantasy-relevant aspect of the Bills has been their offense \u2014 as a target for streaming defenses. In six games since its stunning upset of the Vikings, Buffalo has coughed up the week\u2019s most fantasy points to the opposing D/ST an equally stunning four times, with a top-three display of generosity in one of the other games.\n\nSo I\u2019ll give you one guess as to why I have the Jets, a D/ST with just two top-10 scoring outings since Week 2 and none in the top five since Week 1, as my top-ranked unit this week. The Bills might get back Allen, who has been out since Week 6, but it\u2019s more likely that Peterman, he of the historically high interception rate, gets another start. J-E-T-S! (Just Enjoy the Turnovers and Sacks!)\n\nNote that The Washington Post defaults to PPR scoring, and that the rankings will update throughout the week, so please check back frequently. Here are this week\u2019s top movers and players of note.\n\nOn a bye this week: Broncos, Ravens, Texans, Vikings.\n\nQuarterbacks: Last week, the Saints\u2019 Drew Brees played in the game with the highest over/under and produced the highest QB score. Even though he\u2019s on the road this time, that Brees is once again in the game predicted by Vegas to be the highest-scoring is good enough for me. . . . With the rate the Packers\u2019 RBs are committing game-changing fumbles, Aaron Rodgers may never want to hand the ball off again as long as outcomes are in question. . . . The Chiefs\u2019 Patrick Mahomes has thrown for at least 300 yards in eight straight games, tied with Andrew Luck (2014) for the longest streak in NFL history. . . . Suddenly, with the emergence of D.J. Moore and Curtis Samuel to complement Devin Funchess, Greg Olsen and Christian McCaffrey, the Panthers\u2019 Cam Newton has as multifaceted a group of dangerous receivers as any QB in the league. . . . Congrats to Philip Rivers on having become just the fourth NFL QB ever to make 200 straight starts. Meanwhile, the Chargers\u2019 kicker, whoever that turns out to be in the wake of Caleb Sturgis\u2019s disastrous outing, will be working on a streak of one start in a row. . . . In his return as a starter, the Buccaneers\u2019 Ryan Fitzpatrick showed exactly how he\u2019s so shaky in real life yet so solid in fantasy. . . . The Bengals\u2019 Andy Dalton is missing some weapons (more on that below) but is the other half of Brees\u2019s aforementioned expected shootout. . . . The Redskins\u2019 Alex Smith gets the tastiest possible matchup in the Bucs, but he just can\u2019t be trusted to take full advantage. . . . Nick Mullens is ranked with the assumption that his remarkably effective outing last week will enable him to remain the 49ers\u2019 starter over C.J. Beathard.\n\nRunning backs: Given that the Cardinals have been much easier to run on than pass against, the Chiefs\u2019 Kareem Hunt should be in line for a heavy, and productive, workload. Not to mention that he\u2019s been ON FIRE of late. . . . The Rams\u2019 Todd Gurley was largely held in check by the Saints, but he now gets a Seahawks defense shredded Sunday by the Chargers\u2019 Melvin Gordon, who in turn should have his way with a thoroughly bedraggled Raiders squad. . . . The Saints have apparently decided that Alvin Kamara, not Mark Ingram, is the RB they prefer to use near the goal line, which means Kamara is back to having a nearly limitless ceiling. . . . Le\u2019Veon Bell won\u2019t be back this week (rinse, repeat), and it may not matter anymore \u2014 that\u2019s how good James Conner has been for the Steelers. . . . Sony Michel is tentatively expected back for the Patriots, but James White has done just fine even when the impressive rookie has been active. . . . Owners of the Falcons\u2019 Tevin Coleman can hope that his Week 9 breakout on more creative usage portends a second-half surge. . . . New Browns offensive coordinator Freddie Kitchens may be just what the doctor ordered for Duke Johnson. . . . Although he hasn\u2019t been catching the ball much, Nick Chubb has been receiving plenty of carries even as Cleveland has been losing. . . . Early-down backs set up for good outings based on expected game flow include the Packers\u2019 Aaron Jones, the Bears\u2019 Jordan Howard and the Jets\u2019 Isaiah Crowell. . . . Adrian Peterson doesn\u2019t have quite such a sunny outlook, with the Redskins listed as underdogs at Tampa Bay. . . . With Raheem Mostert suffering a broken arm, the 49ers\u2019 Matt Breida should be set up for as much work as his injury-prone body can handle, while Alfred Morris gets a bit of new life. . . . With the Seahawks\u2019 Chris Carson battling a thigh injury, Mike Davis gets penciled in ahead of him. . . . We\u2019re all just waiting to find out what plans the Eagles made during their bye for their three-headed RB corps (Wendell Smallwood, Josh Adams and Corey Clement).\n\nWide receivers: Michael Thomas had as many targets (15) in Week 9 as in the Saints\u2019 previous two games combined. More of that, please. . . . The Steelers\u2019 Antonio Brown continues to be uncharacteristically TD-dependent, but as long as he\u2019s scoring in nearly every game, it\u2019s a reasonable arrangement for his owners. . . . The Falcons were actually able to manufacture a TD for Julio Jones. Will wonders never cease? . . . The huge stretch run everyone has been predicting for the Chargers\u2019 Keenan Allen began right on cue last week with 124 yards. . . . The Bengals\u2019 Tyler Boyd in the top 10? Well, with A.J. Green (toe) expected to miss at least a couple of weeks, John Ross gimpy and the TE Tylers (Eifert and Kroft) out of action, Dalton may not have anyone else to throw the ball to while playing catch-up with the Saints. . . . Josh Gordon is starting to turn into the kind of weapon Patriots haters feared he would be. . . . In their first game without Golden Tate, the Lions\u2019 Marvin Jones and Kenny Golladay did next to nothing as the Vikings assaulted Matthew Stafford, and the same could happen at Chicago. But the Bears are much more vulnerable against the pass than the run, so I\u2019m willing to give that duo another chance. . . . With Randall Cobb fading and Geronimo Allison ailing, Marquez Valdes-Scantling is looking a lot like the Packers\u2019 No. 2 WR. . . . The Cowboys aren\u2019t really capable of heavily targeting anybody, but Amari Cooper got about as much of a workload in his debut as could reasonably have been expected. . . . Tate makes his Eagles debut amid a crowded receiving corps. . . . Before heading into the their bye, the Cardinals\u2019 new coaching staff appeared to restore Larry Fitzgerald to being the focal point of the passing attack, but Christian Kirk maintained a healthy share of targets. . . . The Bucs\u2019 Adam Humphries tacked a huge game onto outings of at least 75 yards in two of his previous three games and now merits WR3, not to mention DFS, consideration. . . . If Michel sits out again, the Patriots probably will give more carries to Cordarrelle Patterson, who looked pretty good as a runner. . . . Lord knows, the Redskins don\u2019t seem to have an abundance of good options at WR, so maybe Maurice Harris really is a thing.\n\nTight ends: The Cardinals have generally been tough on TEs, but Travis Kelce has been on too much of a rampage for the Chiefs to be placed anywhere but No. 1. . . . The 49ers\u2019 George Kittle is 13th in the NFL with 692 receiving yards, and his 16.9-yard per-catch average puts him in the top 10. . . . The Eagles\u2019 addition of Golden Tate could siphon a few targets away from Zach Ertz. . . . The Buccaneers\u2019 O.J. Howard has been a steady contributor all season, and now he\u2019s getting into the end zone with regularity. . . . The Panthers\u2019 Greg Olsen has bounced back from his foot injury in a big way. . . . If we get some positive news on his likelihood of playing this week, the Patriots\u2019 Rob Gronkowski might \u2014 I repeat, might \u2014 climb up the rankings. . . . When last seen before the Colts\u2019 bye, Jack Doyle (hip) returned from his lengthy absence and immediately relegated Eric Ebron to No. 2 status. . . . The Bears\u2019 Trey Burton doesn\u2019t always rack up yardage, but he has a TD in five of his past seven games. . . . The Steelers\u2019 Vance McDonald has not been much of a factor of late, but the Panthers have been the most generous team to TEs . . . . The Raiders\u2019 ineptitude is swallowing up Jared Cook, who has 20 yards or fewer in three of his past four. . . . The Redskins\u2019 Jordan Reed has 18 targets over his past two games and just 72 scoreless yards to show for them. . . . Chris Herndon led the Jets on Sunday with 62 yards, which sounds even better (or does it?) when you consider that Sam Darnold only threw for a total of 229.", "BERLIN \u2014 The official overseeing the European Union\u2019s future enlargement says that, in the long term, it would be \u201cmore honest\u201d for the bloc to give up talks on membership for Turkey.\n\nEU Enlargement Commissioner Johannes Hahn was quoted Tuesday as telling German daily Die Welt: \u201cI think that, in the long term, it would be more honest for Turkey and the EU to go down new roads and end the accession talks.\u201d\n\nHahn added that \u201cTurkish membership in the European Union is not realistic in the foreseeable future.\u201d He argued that sticking to the talks has \u201cblocked the path to a realistic, strategic partnership.\u201d\n\nTurkey started its EU accession negotiations in 2005 but the talks are stalled amid concerns over Turkey\u2019s political situation, with some nations opposing membership.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

But make no mistake \u2014 it\u2019s far from a sure thing. FiveThirtyEight gives Democrats an 88 percent chance, which sounds awfully good, but as Nate Silver suggests, you wouldn\u2019t board a plane that has a 12 percent chance of crashing.\n\nThe simplest way to understand the Democrats\u2019 chances is to start with the races they\u2019re likely to win. If they pick up all the GOP-held seats that the Cook Political Report rates as already leaning their way, they will net around 16 seats. That means they need to win only around eight more to net the 23 seats they need for the majority.\n\nThe reason Democrats appear so well positioned to do that is that the battlefield is very wide. They merely need to net those additional eight seats out of dozens and dozens of contests. Cook rates 29 GOP-held seats as \u201cToss Ups\u201d \u2014 meaning Democrats need to win only a third of those \u2014 and another 29 as \u201cLean Republican,\u201d which in this environment are also in play. That\u2019s a total of nearly 60 seats.\n\nMany of the seats that are already leaning Democratic are in districts that were carried by Hillary Clinton in 2016 or are highly educated or suburban or more racially diverse. Many of the Toss Ups are also in more educated and suburban areas, though Democrats are also trying to expand into more exurban and rural districts, where they have also fielded candidates, which has also broadened the map.\n\nI spoke with Dan Sena, executive director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, about his view of the map, why he thinks Democrats have multiple paths to the majority, and the big question that keeps him awake at night. An edited and condensed version of our conversation follows.\n\nPLUM LINE: What\u2019s the prediction?\n\nDAN SENA: One of the key strategic pieces that we put into place is a battlefield that can produce a narrow victory or a larger victory. There are probably about 15 to 20 races that would immediately come our way. Sitting behind them is another 20 to 30 where we are either down a couple points, tied or up a point or two. The key question is: How will those races break, and in what direction?\n\nPLUM LINE: The low-hanging fruit are mostly districts that Clinton won, that are highly educated and suburban?\n\nSENA: Seventy-five percent of them are well-educated, suburban or heavily diverse districts.\n\nPLUM LINE: What characterizes the \u201cToss Up\u201d districts?\n\nSENA: These are all districts with a unique feature that gives the Democrat an advantage, because the environment, or the strength or history of the candidate, has put races in play that Republicans didn\u2019t see coming. It\u2019s a smattering of different types of districts.\n\nPLUM LINE: [President] Trump\u2019s closing argument must have worked in some places and not in others. Can you get granular on where the migrant caravan, birthright citizenship and so forth are working for them and where they aren\u2019t?\n\nSENA: Every time he does something, there\u2019s an equal and opposite reaction someplace. When he\u2019s doing that, it helps us in California and the Chicago suburbs \u2014 races like Illinois 6 and 14 move towards us. It helps us in Northern Virginia. It remains to be seen what that type of conversation does in North Carolina, in more rural Illinois, in some of the more rural Texas seats.\n\nWe designed our strategy so that regardless of what he did, we would be able to maximize opportunity someplace else on the battlefield. In some of the more rural districts in Ohio and Texas, or even Washington 5 \u2014 where you have higher white populations \u2014 those could become more challenging.\n\nPLUM LINE: There\u2019s been talk that Democrats have been so focused on health care that they haven\u2019t directly engaged Trump\u2019s attacks on immigrants. I\u2019m trying to get a sense of where the equal and opposite reaction you\u2019re talking about comes from.\n\nSENA: The reaction has to do with everything that Trump does, not just immigration. He is in the background of all of this regardless of the issue he\u2019s talking about.\n\nPLUM LINE: What about turnout among young voters and Latinos?\n\nSENA: Millennials are already voting at [rates] that are knocking on the door of 2016. Look at California \u2014 the percentage of the vote share that Hispanics are making up is knocking on the door of 2016. [Both groups] are already going to make up a larger share than they do traditionally in any midterm cycle. We\u2019re seeing the same with African Americans in Florida and Georgia.\n\nWill that hold on Election Day? That\u2019s why we\u2019re spending $30 million to make sure they get out and vote.\n\nPLUM LINE: In your polling, are you finding that a lot of these Republican incumbents are at a perilously low point? The Upshot\u2019s polling has a lot of them hovering at around 45 percent.\n\nSENA: In many, yes. But we also have many where we\u2019re up by like two, and we\u2019re knocking on the door of 50 and they\u2019re at like 48.\n\nPLUM LINE: What\u2019s the nightmare scenario? What has to go wrong big time for it not to come together?\n\nSENA: The biggest question that keeps me up at night is: When Trump engages the base, what actually happens? I don\u2019t think anybody really knows. When he engages, and there are larger shares of people voting on both sides, it becomes less predictable. We tried to build a system that would account for reaction to Trump in both a positive and negative way.\n\nPLUM LINE: Are there any surprise expenditures in districts that we don\u2019t know about?\n\nSENA: We spent several hundred thousand dollars in places like New York 27, California 50, Alaska [at large], Iowa 4, Ohio 7 \u2014 in very red areas.\n\nPLUM LINE: What\u2019s the most likely outcome?\n\nSENA: I think we can win the House narrowly, and I think we can win it by a little more than narrowly. The point was to create a series of paths that get us there. We have invested in 80 districts across the country. The scope of the battlefield is unparalleled.\n\nRead more:\n\nPaul Waldman: Trump\u2019s hilarious Obamacare gaffe reveals the GOP bind on health care\n\nJennifer Rubin: The final polls tell us why Trump may sink the GOP\n\nWhat can we expect from the midterms?

The investigation followed allegations that British consultancy Cambridge Analytica improperly used information from more than 87 million Facebook accounts to manipulate elections.\n\nDenham said legal systems had failed to keep up with the rapid development of the internet, and that tech companies need to be subject to greater oversight.\n\n\u201cI think the time for self-regulation is over,\u201d she said. \u201cThat ship has sailed.\u201d\n\nCommittee chair Damian Collins said he heard her opinion \u201cloudly\u201d and repeated his demand that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testify before his committee.\n\nAs she updated lawmakers on the probe, Denham announced fines for the campaign backing Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union and an insurance company founded by its millionaire backer totaling 135,000 pounds ($176,000) for breaches of data laws.\n\nDenham said the Brexit campaign group Leave.EU and Eldon Insurance company \u2014 founded by businessman Arron Banks \u2014were fined 60,000 pounds each for \u201cserious breaches\u201d of electronic marketing laws.\n\nLeave.EU was also fined 15,000 pounds for a separate breach in which almost 300,000 emails were sent to Eldon customers with a newsletter for the Brexit campaign group.\n\nThe data watchdog is also \u201cinvestigating allegations that Eldon Insurance Services Limited shared customer data obtained for insurance purposes with Leave.EU.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

On the other side is the Republican gubernatorial nominee Brian Kemp, Georgia\u2019s secretary of state, who has faced a steady stream of lawsuits over policies that critics charge are unfairly disenfranchising voters, especially minorities and the poor.\u201d You\u2019d think Georgians would be embarrassed to have 2018 politics compared to the Jim Crow era.\n\nYou can count on Trump to blame someone else. \u201cWith a global economy increasingly destabilized and fractured under the stress of Trump\u2019s trade war, a recession in the U.S. could quickly infect the global economy.

(Richard Drew/AP)\n\nYochai Benkler, Rob Faris and Hal Robert, three scholars affiliated with Harvard\u2019s Berkman Klein Center, have a new book, \u201cNetwork Propaganda: Manipulation, Disinformation, and Radicalization in American Politics,\u201d presenting major new research about the political consequences of American media. I asked Benkler, who is the Berkman professor of Entrepreneurial Legal Studies at Harvard Law School, and faculty co-director of the Berkman Klein Center, about what they found.\n\nYour research finds that America has two very different media ecosystems \u2014 one brings together the political center and the left, and the other is largely confined to the right. What are the key differences between them?\n\nOn the right, audiences concentrate attention on purely right wing outlets. On the left and center audiences spread their attention broadly and focus on mainstream organizations. This asymmetric pattern holds for the linking practices of media producers. Both supply and demand on the right are insular and self-focused. On the left and center they are spread broadly and anchored by professional press.\n\nThese differences create a different dynamic for media, audiences, and politicians on the left and right.\n\nWe all like to hear news that confirms our beliefs and identity. On the left, outlets and politicians try to attract readers by telling such stories but are constrained because their readers are exposed to a range of outlets, many of which operate with strong fact-checking norms.\n\nOn the right, because audiences do not trust or pay attention to outlets outside their own ecosystem, there is no reality check to constrain competition. Outlets compete on political purity and stoking identity-confirming narratives. Outlets and politicians who resist the flow by focusing on facts are abandoned or vilified by audiences and competing outlets. This forces media and political elites to validate and legitimate the falsehoods, at least through silence, creating a propaganda feedback loop.\n\nWhat tools do you use to map out these media ecosystems, and how do they work?\n\nWe use Media Cloud, a data collection and analysis platform that we at Harvard\u2019s Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society have been developing in collaboration with our colleagues at the MIT Center for Civic Media for a decade.\n\nFor this study, we collected 4 million stories from the U.S. presidential election and the first year of the Trump presidency. We analyzed what outlets these stories linked to, how often and how they were tweeted, and how often they were shared on Facebook. We use network analysis of the link network to analyze the authority different sites have among media producers, and of who tweets what and how often to measure audience attention. We use the tweeting of Trump and Clinton followers to identify the mix of political orientations of a site\u2019s audience. And we use a range of text analysis techniques to understand what these outlets discussed and when.\n\nYou argue that the most serious problem is Fox News, not Facebook. Why so?\n\nBecause that\u2019s where the eyeballs are.\n\nThe highly asymmetric pattern of media ecosystems we observe on the right and the left, despite the fact that Facebook and Twitter usage is roughly similar on both sides, requires that we look elsewhere for what is causing the difference.\n\nSurveys make it clear that Fox News is by far the most influential outlet on the American right \u2014 more than five times as many Trump supporters reported using Fox News as their primary news outlet than those who named Facebook. And Trump support was highest among demographics whose social media use was lowest.\n\nOur data repeatedly show Fox as the transmission vector of widespread conspiracy theories. The original Seth Rich conspiracy did not take off when initially propagated in July 2016 by fringe and pro-Russia sites, but only a year later, as Fox News revived it when James Comey was fired. The Clinton pedophilia libel that resulted in Pizzagate was started by a Fox online report, repeated across the Fox TV schedule, and provided the prime source of validation across the right-wing media ecosystem.\n\nIn 2017 Fox repeatedly attacked the national security establishment and law enforcement whenever the Trump-Russia investigation heated up. Each attack involved significant online activity, but the spikes in attention and transition moments are associated with Hannity, \u201cFox & Friends\u201d and others like Tucker Carlson or Lou Dobbs.\n\nWhy does your research suggest that there isn\u2019t any epistemic crisis on the left, even though some left-wing people have seriously mistaken beliefs?\n\nOn both sides of the political spectrum, manipulative clickbait sites lure people to read stories that feed their outrage. Russian propaganda is aimed at both sides on Facebook and Twitter. We all suffer confirmation bias. We all occasionally fall prey to this desire.\n\nBut \u201cpost-truth\u201d or epistemic crisis are population-level effects \u2014 where an entire chunk of the population loses the ability to tell truth from identity-confirming fiction \u2014 not individual or small group effects. Because people on the left use a broad range of media mostly subject to mutual policing for facts and misinformation, they regularly encounter stories that give them a reality check. This limits the spread of disinformation in the population as a whole, although it cannot prevent discrete instances of false belief.\n\nOn the right, millions of people wake up with \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d commute with talk radio, have lunch with Limbaugh, or settle in for an evening of Carlson, Hannity and Ingraham, as their president tweets against the fake news media. These are their most trusted news sources, and they have been telling their audiences for over 20 years that they can\u2019t trust anything they hear outside their own propaganda bubble. The outrage industry amplifies, reinforces and monetizes the desire to satisfy confirmation bias, while insulating its audiences from sources that could give them a reality check (and reduce profits).\n\nDoes your research shed light on arguments about whether Trump and right-wing media have any responsibility for recent terrorist attacks and attempts?\n\nWe have a detailed chapter on how Trump and Breitbart interacted to force the Republican Party to make immigration the number one agenda item, and framed it in starkly Islamophobic terms. We show text-analysis-based evidence that the term \u201cGlobalist\u201d originated in antisemitic white supremacist sites, was transmitted to the mainstream by Breitbart while its antisemitic evocation of a global Jewish conspiracy was still clear, and was generalized by Lou Dobbs and Fox more generally.", "FILE - In this Jan. 22, 2014, file photo, a partially constructed gas refinery at the South Pars gas field is seen on the northern coast of Persian Gulf in Asalouyeh, Iran. Japan, South Korea and other major oil importers welcomed Tuesday the decision by the Trump administration to let them continue to import Iranian crude oil and other petroleum products despite the re-imposition of sanctions on Tehran. (Vahid Salemi, File/Associated Press)\n\nSEOUL, South Korea \u2014 Japan, South Korea and other major oil importers welcomed Tuesday the decision by the Trump administration to let them continue to import Iranian crude oil and other petroleum products despite the re-imposition of sanctions on Tehran.\n\nThe risk of excessive disruption to world markets was a key factor behind the decision to allow exemptions for some of the biggest, most oil-thirsty economies. It appeared to have paid off.\n\nAs of midday Tuesday oil prices had fallen moderately, with benchmark U.S. crude down 0.3 percent and Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, down nearly 0.4 percent. The fear was that the sanctions deadline would have pushed oil prices sharply higher.\n\nFive of the eight economies granted waivers as long as they work to reduce oil imports from Iran to zero are in Asia: China, India, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. The others were Greece, Italy and Turkey.\n\nThe sanctions on Iran were lifted under its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. President Donald Trump rejected that accord, and on Monday the U.S. Treasury Department imposed penalties on more than 700 Iranian and Iranian-linked individuals, entities, aircraft and vessels in the new sanctions.\n\nThe new sanctions were particularly aimed at Iran\u2019s vital oil industry, which provides a crucial source of hard currency.\n\nJapan said it was pleased to be temporarily spared from possible penalties for importing Iranian oil. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters Tokyo was analyzing the potential impact and was in close consultations with the U.S. on protecting Japanese companies from \u201cadverse consequences.\u201d\n\nThose would include penalties for breaking long-term oil purchasing agreements.\n\nStill, South Korean Trade Minister Kim Hyun-chong said Tuesday that the waiver had \u201copened breathing room\u201d for South Korea\u2019s oil refining industry, which relies on imports of a very light crude oil called condensate.\n\nThe waiver also is a relief for South Korean companies that export to Iran: The U.S. also agreed to uphold a special transaction system set up in October 2010 after discussions between Washington and Seoul that essentially allows South Korea to take Iranian oil as payments for its goods.\n\nWith the U.S. upholding the transaction system, South Korean companies will be able to continue exporting non-sanctioned items to Iran, officials said.\n\nIndia has a similar arrangement whereby Iran can use crude oil to pay for food and other necessities.\n\n\u201cThese countries currently take the lion\u2019s share of Iranian oil exports. It is therefore likely that Iranian oil exports will stabilize at their present level of a good 1 million barrels per day,\u201d analysts at Commerzbank said in a commentary.\n\nThey said Iran\u2019s exports could well recover somewhat since Japan and South Korea had sharply cut their imports in the past few months as they sought the waivers from the U.S.\n\nFor both Japan and China, Iran is a significant but not huge supplier. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Russia, Qatar and Kuwait export more crude oil to Japan than Iran.\n\nChina, which said it regretted the U.S. rejection of the deal with Iran, is the single-largest importer of crude oil, at about 9 million barrels a day, and also of Iranian oil, so cutting off all shipments could have jolted global markets.\n\nBut while its demand is huge, China has diversified and relies on Iran for less than 10 percent of its total crude oil imports, with Saudi Arabia, Angola, Russia, Oman and Iraq providing more than half, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n\nMajor European allies have opposed the U.S. decision to reject the nuclear deal with Iran. The 28-nation European Union reportedly is preparing a new financial mechanism to help its companies avoid U.S. sanctions, and that could help keep Iranian oil exports flowing.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s Downing Street office said Tuesday that the U.K. will continue to expand trade relations despite the decision.\n\n\u201cWe regret the re-imposition of sanctions by the U.S.,\u201d May\u2019s spokesman James Slack said. \u201cWe continue to fully support expanding our trade relationship with Iran and encourage U.K. businesses to take advantage of the commercial opportunities that arise.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Mari Yamaguchi in Tokyo, Danica Kirka in London and Elaine Kurtenbach in Bangkok contributed.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

With Republicans probably losing the House, they (and President Trump, in particular) have focused on the Senate. And if they hold it or even gain some seats, you can guarantee they\u2019ll cite it as a win, and possibly even a split decision overall.\n\nThis will be false.\n\nThat pre-spinning has begun, with Kellyanne Conway noting last week that it\u2019s rare for the president\u2019s party to gain Senate seats in a midterm election. \u201cThink about that.

They only had two obvious pickup opportunities at the start (Arizona and Nevada), and they needed a three-seat gain. Since then, they\u2019ve won the Alabama special election \u2014 reducing their majority-winning threshold to a two-seat gain \u2014 and added Tennessee and Texas as possible, if perhaps unlikely, pickups. That those states are even in play tells you everything you need to know about where things are at, red-vs.-blue-wise.\n\nThe reason Republicans might gain seats is pretty simple: The map is distorted. Democrats had to defend 10 states that went for Trump, while Republicans had to defend only one that went for Hillary Clinton (Nevada). If Republicans gain seats, it\u2019s almost definitely going to be in territory Trump won by double digits. These are states they should be winning; they just happen to be held by Democrats because 2006 and 2012 \u2014 the last time these seats were up \u2014 were both good Democratic years.\n\nLook at the seats that are in play:\n\nWest Virginia: Trump +42\n\nNorth Dakota: Trump +36\n\nTennessee: Trump +26\n\nMontana: Trump +20\n\nIndiana: Trump +19\n\nMissouri: Trump +19\n\nTexas: Trump +9\n\nArizona: Trump +4\n\nFlorida: Trump +1\n\nNevada: Clinton +2\n\nThat\u2019s six of Trump\u2019s 16 best states that Republicans are trying to win \u2014 and don\u2019t even have locked down. You\u2019d have to put blinders on to think that winning such favorable territory makes up for potentially losing the House (where the map also tilts Republican, by the way).\n\nThe point is that if we had anything amounting to a neutral map, we\u2019d almost definitely be talking about a Senate takeover by Democrats. And even if they keep things close, they will be setting themselves up well for 2020 and especially for 2022, when they have more opportunities and less tough defense to play. As Nathaniel Rakich has argued at FiveThirtyEight, defending these red states in a good year for Democrats might be the best thing that could have happened for them, even if they don\u2019t actually gain seats, because they were actually hold-able under these circumstances.\n\nBut the idea that it\u2019s a split decision when one party gains in one chamber and the other gains in the other \u2014 or even that Republicans gain in the Senate while Democrats take over the House \u2014 is plausible enough on its face that plenty of people are likely to accept it at face value. It has the doubly attractive distinction of bucking the conventional wisdom, which is something every analyst is fond of.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t make it true. And it won\u2019t mean Democrats didn\u2019t have a good night \u2014 assuming they actually do well in the House. If Republicans hold the House, then we can talk about how they had a pretty good night.", "\n\nWhy is the U.S. Election Day always a Tuesday \u2014 and not any other day of the week? (Paul J. Richards/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nIn a recent editorial, Stanford professors Adam Bonica and Michael McFaul endorsed A Day Off For Democracy \u2014 a campaign to give Americans paid time off on Election Day.\n\nWhy does America vote on Tuesdays, and what other alternatives might there be? Here are seven things you should know about the timing of Election Day.\n\nWhy are American federal elections held on Tuesdays?\n\nThe United States has held federal elections on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November in even-numbered years since 1845.\n\nTuesday was selected because it was the most convenient day for voting in 19th-century America. Most eligible voters were Christian farmers. People traveled by horse and buggy, and it could take a full day to travel to one\u2019s polling site. Tuesday was ideal because it would not require travel on the Sunday Sabbath or interfere with \u201cmarket day\u201d on Wednesday.\n\n[Why it can be rational to vote]\n\nAre there alternative election days in the United States?\n\nAlthough all states conduct federal elections on a Tuesday, some states offer alternatives to in-person Tuesday voting. For example, 37 states (plus the District) offer early voting before Election Day.\n\nVoting by mail is also an option for many people. Three states vote entirely by mail, and 27 states (plus the District) allow excuse-free absentee voting \u2014 meaning citizens can opt to vote by mail simply because they prefer to do so.\n\nIn 20 states, however, people can only vote by mail if they have an acceptable excuse. In Pennsylvania, for example, a citizen who wants to vote by mail must submit a signed statement explaining why they cannot vote in person. If a Pennsylvania voter has a medical reason for wanting to vote by mail, they need to describe their medical condition and list their doctor on the ballot request form.\n\nThe National Conference of State Legislatures sums up the variation in early and absentee voting in this figure.\n\n\n\nHow America votes, state by state. Source: National Conference of State Legislatures, http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/absentee-and-early-voting.aspx.\n\nHow does America compare with the rest of the world?\n\nThe United States is one of the few democracies in the world that conducts weekday voting. For the rest of the world, Sunday is by far the most common voting day.\n\n\n\nFor much of the world, Sunday is the day to vote, not Tuesday. Source: https://imgur.com/MZJB5QR, data from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_day.\n\nCould the United States move elections to the weekend?\n\nAn obvious alternative to Tuesday voting is to move federal elections to the weekend \u2014 either on Saturday or Sunday, or as a two-day event across both days. Weekend voting has received multiple endorsements in the media. In Congress, the Weekend Voting Act has seven co-sponsors in the Senate (S. 1828), and 97 co-sponsors in the House (H.R. 1094). Similar bills have been introduced in every session for over a decade. Yet none has ever made it out of committee.\n\nAdvocates argue weekend voting would be more convenient overall, as fewer Americans work on the weekends. They stress that weekday voting is particularly taxing for single parents, students and citizens who work multiple jobs. Lines would also be shorter on average, because turnout would be more spread out throughout the day.\n\nCritics argue more people travel away from home on the weekends, and the burden of voting would just shift to other populations who have more weekend obligations. Moreover, the costs of running elections might be substantially increased. Because Saturday and Sunday are Sabbath days for devout Jews and Christians, elections would probably have to be held over the two-day period \u2014 creating a need for more poll workers and a process for securing ballots overnight.\n\nWhat about making Election Day a federal holiday?\n\nIn 2001, the National Commission on Federal Election Reform recommended making Election Day a federal holiday. They suggested merging Election Day with Veterans Day. Fourteen states (plus the territory of Puerto Rico) already consider Election Day a statewide public holiday.\n\nA bill to create a Democracy Day at the federal level was introduced in the House and Senate in 2005, but again \u2014 it never made it out of committee.\n\nAdvocates of an Election Day holiday stress that time off could relieve the workday burden of Tuesday voting and enhance civic culture.\n\nHowever, critics note that not all employees get the day off during federal holidays \u2014 and that the types of workers least likely to reap the benefits of a federal holiday are those who already struggle to vote.\n\nWould any of these changes increase turnout?\n\nThe short answer is: We don\u2019t know for sure.\n\nIt is difficult to estimate how much each change actually affects turnout. There are many policies that vary between states and countries, making it difficult to isolate the effects of any single policy. Moreover, the full effects of electoral change may only be evident in the long run because much of voting behavior is habitual and changes gradually over time.\n\n[Majorities of millennials who plan to vote support Democrats \u2014 except among white men]\n\nCountries with weekend voting do have higher turnout than those that do not, but it is difficult to directly attribute differences in turnout to weekend voting alone. The Government Accountability Office reported that likely effects of weekend voting on U.S. turnout are uncertain, and another study found that changes in weekend voting laws elsewhere had no effect on turnout.\n\nThe estimated effects of \u201cconvenience voting\u201d policies \u2014 such as early voting and excuse-free voting by mail \u2014 vary widely. Several studies suggest policies that make it easier to vote do indeed increase turnout. Others suggest voting by mail might actually decrease turnout by diminishing the social experience of voting in person. Still others suggest that while convenience voting saves time and effort among the people who are already voting, it does little to help populations that have the lowest turnout.\n\nWhat about getting paid time off on Election Day?\n\nSome countries mandate that all employers offer paid time off on Election Day. There is no such federal law in the United States, though a \u201cTime Off to Vote Act\u201d has been proposed in Congress. Some states do have time-off-to-vote laws \u2014 though they vary on whether this time off is paid or unpaid. Many states have no such laws.\n\nStanford professors Adam Bonica and Michael McFaul recently called on businesses and universities to voluntarily cancel classes and grant paid time off to employees on Election Day. More than 400 political science professors and voting rights experts signed onto this campaign. Some universities \u2014 such as Stanford and Northwestern Law \u2014 have also created their own universitywide Election Day holidays.\n\nDespite the absence of federal regulation, more than 300 companies have voluntarily pledged to grant paid time off to their employees on Election Day in 2018. Many companies signed on to similar campaigns in previous elections as well.\n\nAccording to the Census Bureau, registered voters cited conflicting schedules as the most common reason for not voting in 2008, 2010, 2012 and 2014, and as the second most common reason in 2016.\n\nThus, it seems intuitive that making it easier to vote would at least reduce the costs of voting for some people and might also increase turnout among others.\n\nVictoria Shineman is an assistant professor in the Department of Political Science at the University of Pittsburgh.", "The night was clear, the air thick with humidity and filled with the sounds of Vivaldi\u2019s \u201cFour Seasons.\u201d It was Oct. 27 in Mosul, Iraq, and a makeshift orchestra was putting on a show \u2014 one unlike anything the city had seen for decades, one local journalist said.\n\nThe orchestra \u2014 a mix of players including a range of Baghdad professionals as well as local amateurs \u2014 drew an audience of hundreds to a plot of land where the Islamic State once trained its next generation of soldiers. For spectators and participants, it marked an artistic rebirth in a city still trying to rebuild after the militant group\u2019s harrowing three-year rule.\n\nMosul, ruled by the Islamic State from 2014 to 2017, was the largest city under the group\u2019s control. Civilians were ruled by a strict religious code that called for harsh punishments; executions of men and women charged with crimes such as spying or adultery were routinely held in public squares. Then much of Mosul was destroyed during the Iraqi government\u2019s eight-month offensive to recapture the city, during which hundreds of thousands of civilians fled and thousands of others were killed.\n\nIt has been more than a year after since then-Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi declared Mosul liberated, but much of the city is still in ruins and struggling to find the funding to pick up the pieces. Organizers of last month\u2019s performance hoped the concert could help residents grapple with the trauma.\n\n\u201cThis city deserves culturally to be identified as somewhere where there should be music instead of the sound of bombs,\u201d said the concert\u2019s conductor, Karim Wasfi. Wasfi is the former conductor of the Iraqi National Symphony Orchestra, whose Peace Through Art foundation helped put on the show.\n\nWasfi is known for bringing music to dark places. He drew international attention in 2015 when he played his cello atop some rubble in Baghdad where a car bomb had exploded the day before. Mourners and passersby sang along as he played Iraq\u2019s national anthem.\n\nThat performance came during a bleak time: The Islamic State still held control of major swaths of the country, and hundreds of civilians were killed each month by acts of terrorism and violence. The purpose of playing, Wasfi told The Washington Post at the time, was to reach \u201cout to people exactly where someone had experienced something so grotesque and ugly earlier.\u201d\n\n\n\nKarim Wasfi during a concert in Mosul, Iraq, on Oct. 27. (Ari Jalal/Reuters)\n\nWasfi\u2019s organization hoped to do the same in Mosul \u2014 and also perhaps draw attention from international donors who could help reconstruction efforts.\n\n\u201cThe government is depending on international support to rebuild Mosul,\u201d said Salih Elias, a local journalist who helped organize the show. \u201cA concert like this will send a positive message to the international world.\u201d\n\nSure enough, the city is drawing more cultural summits in the hopes of revitalization. This weekend, the annual Iraqi song festival took place at the University of Mosul, a choice made by the national government.\n\n\u201cWe insisted \u2026 to do the festival this year in Mosul to support this city because it\u2019s been through a lot, and to send a message to the whole world that Mosul is alive,\u201d said Asia Kamal, the deputy head of the Iraqi Artists Association, who spearheaded the festival.\n\nWasfi and his band of musicians will perform in Mosul again Saturday. This time, Elias said, the concert will take place in the more heavily damaged western half of the city, near a tall building where the Islamic State used to execute LGBT people by throwing them from the roof.\n\n\u201cWe are fighting their terror with life and music,\u201d he said.\n\nRead more:\n\nAfter car bombs explode, an Iraqi musician shows up with his cello\n\nAfter victory over ISIS, Mosul discovers the cost: Homes were turned into graves\n\nHow the people of Mosul lived through the war and the stories they told us along the way", "BERLIN \u2014 German authorities say a man who was supposed to appear as a witness at a trial in Germany failed to show up and was found dead in a court toilet three days later.\n\nThe news agency dpa reported Tuesday the 70-year-old was supposed to testify on Oct. 29 at Kiel district court.

On Nov 11, 1918, allies like Britain and France were exhausted, Germany was as good as defeated and U.S. Gen. John J. Pershing had another 2 million troops ready to come over. (Thibault Camus, File/Associated Press)\n\nROMAGNE-SOUS-MONTFAUCON, France \u2014 On the final morning of World War I, U.S. Gen. John J. Pershing was not eager to stop fighting. After all, if one nation had momentum after the first global war\u2019s four years of unprecedented slaughter, it was the United States.\n\nU.S. troops would push forward on several fronts in France until the minute a cease-fire took effect at 11 a.m. on Nov. 11, six hours after it was negotiated. With more time, the Americans might even have entered Germany soon after, establishing themselves as the world\u2019s ascendant military power.\n\nWhen Pvt.

On Nov. 11, 1918, allies like Britain and France were exhausted, Germany was as good as defeated and Pershing had another 2 million troops ready to come over.\n\n\u201cIf war had continued into 1919, the No. 1 army in the world fighting at the front would have been the U.S. Army \u2014 without a doubt,\u201d Czubak said. \u201cIt is also why he wanted to continue even after Nov. 11.\u201d\n\nNear the place where Saenz heard bombshells explode a century ago now stands the Meuse-Argonne American Cemetery at the French town of Romagne-sous-Montfaucon. American soldiers who died on that armistice day \u2014 100 of them \u2014 are buried there along with 14,146 fellow U.S. troops. The cemetery holds the largest number of U.S. military dead in Europe.\n\nBy the time World War I ended, Americans had been in enough battles that they were interred in a half-dozen cemeteries dotted across northern France. In a war where the dead would be counted in millions \u2014 1.4 million for France, 1.1 million for British imperial forces \u2014 the United States had 126,000 dead to mourn.\n\nWhen U.S. President Donald Trump joins other world leaders at World War I armistice events hosted by French President Emmanuel Macron this weekend, he plans to visit some of the burial sites.\n\nAnd standing among the white crosses, Trump will see that the pre-eminent military force he commands had its roots in French soil, where U.S. troops were instrumental in turning the tide after their nation shed its isolationism and stood by its European allies.\n\nIf the Meuse-Argonne American Cemetery symbolizes America\u2019s coming-of-age in the war, the Aisne-Marne cemetery at the Belleau Wood battleground marks its beginning.\n\nWhen the war started in 1914, most Americans considered it \u201cEurope\u2019s war.\u201d A hit song in 1915 was titled \u201cI Didn\u2019t Raise My Boy To Be A Soldier\u201d and President Woodrow Wilson won re-election in 1916 with the campaign slogan \u201cHe kept us out of war.\u201d\n\nGerman belligerence soon had Americans rethinking the wisdom of isolation, said Bruce Malone, a historian and superintendent of the Meuse-Argonne American Cemetery.\n\n\u201cUnrestricted warfare, sinking ships with Americans on them or American ships\u201d and the infamous Zimmermann telegram in which Germany promised to give Mexico some American territory if it kept the U.S. engaged shifted the momentum, he said.\n\n\u201cEven President Wilson, who did not want to be in the war, had no choice,\u201d said Malone.\n\nOn April 6, 1917, the U.S. declared war, much to the relief of its European allies.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t going well in Europe at the time, and the Germans were actually gaining some momentum. The Allies were essentially running out of men to fight the war,\u201d Malone said.\n\nThere was one problem though, he added.\n\n\u201cWe join the war. We\u2019ve made promises, but we don\u2019t have an army. Certainly not of the European standard,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeed was of the essence. Russia left the war in March 1918 and Germany had sent its troops to the Western front for a final full onslaught. Just in time, U.S. soldiers started arriving en masse.\n\nPershing, disregarding British and French pleas to use U.S. troops to beef up depleted lines under British and French command, always wanted his men to fight as an independent American force. A major breakthrough came at Belleau Wood, when U.S. forces stopped a German advance on Paris against heavy odds. It proved their mettle to the enemy and allies alike.\n\nThe Americans kept building on their newly acknowledged grit through the end of the war. Saenz was there to record it.\n\n\u201cThe bloody fighting and our victory was the decisive blow that finished the Teutonic pride and dispelled forever the Germans\u2019 false dream of global conquest,\u201d he wrote after a Nov. 2 victory.\n\nInstead, the United States could start dreaming of making the next century its own.\n\n___\n\nVideojournalist Mark Carlson and photojournalist Virginia Mayo contributed reporting.\n\n___\n\nFor more information on World War I, go to The Associated Press\u2019 WWI hub: https://www.apnews.com/WorldWarI\n\n___\n\nWorld War I: An AP Centennial Commemorative Edition.

(Massoud Hossaini/Associated Press)\n\nKABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 The NATO chief urged the Taliban on Tuesday to stop killing their fellow Afghans, an appeal that came just hours after the insurgents attacked border troops in western Farah province, killing at least 20.\n\nSpeaking at a joint press conference with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the \u201cTaliban must realize the war does not benefit anyone.\u201d\n\nA resurgent Taliban now hold nearly half of Afghanistan and carry out near-daily attacks on Afghan security forces, inflicting heavy casualties. The Taliban view the U.S.-backed government in Kabul as a dysfunctional Western puppet and have refused repeated offers to negotiate with it.\n\nBut Washington and NATO are holding out hope, seeking to find a negotiated exit to 17 years of war.\n\nSpeaking alongside Stoltenberg, Ghani said his government hopes \u201cthe beginning of formal negotiations is not far.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe result has to be an inclusive Afghan peace, one that all Afghans accept,\u201d he said. To this end, \u201cwe support the engagement of our international colleagues.\u201d\n\nThe remarks of the two stood in sharp contrast to the violence that shakes the nation almost daily.\n\nIn western Farah province, the Taliban attacked an Afghan border base on Monday night, killing at least 20 troops and abducting about 20 others.\n\nAccording to Abdul Samad Salehi, a provincial council member, about 45 border forces were based at the outpost in the Posht Koh district as it was overrun by the Taliban, setting off an hours-long gunbattle.

A senior army official in Farah, who was not authorize to speak to the media, confirmed the casualty figures.\n\nTaliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid claimed responsibility for the Farah attack; he also claimed several military vehicles and large amounts of amination were seized.\n\nOne of the key demands of the Taliban is that all foreign forces should leave the country.\n\nStoltenberg said one of the reasons for the high casualties among the Afghan security forces is that they have taken the responsibility for the \u201csecurity of the entire country.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere no way I can go back to Europe or to United States, NATO allies and partners and say that it didn\u2019t exactly go as we expected, so now we should leave (Afghanistan),\u201d Stoltenberg said. \u201cThat will be a total wrong approach; we are here because it is in our interest to be here, to increase our own security.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Vahid Salemi, File/Associated Press)\n\nSEOUL, South Korea \u2014 Japan, South Korea and other major oil importers welcomed Tuesday the decision by the Trump administration to let them continue to import Iranian crude oil and other petroleum products despite the re-imposition of sanctions on Tehran.\n\nThe risk of excessive disruption to world markets was a key factor behind the decision to allow exemptions for some of the biggest, most oil-thirsty economies. It appeared to have paid off.\n\nAs of midday Tuesday oil prices had fallen moderately, with benchmark U.S. crude down 0.3 percent and Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, down nearly 0.4 percent. The fear was that the sanctions deadline would have pushed oil prices sharply higher.\n\nFive of the eight economies granted waivers are in Asia: China, India, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. The others were Greece, Italy and Turkey.\n\nJapan said it was pleased to be temporarily spared from possible penalties for importing Iranian oil. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters Tokyo was analyzing the potential impact and was in close consultations with the U.S. on protecting Japanese companies from \u201cadverse consequences.\u201d\n\nFaced with the Nov. 5 deadline for re-imposing sanctions, the major importing countries had been winding down their purchases, which have dropped in recent months by more than a million barrels of crude per day. That deadline has now been extended.\n\nStill, South Korean Trade Minister Kim Hyun-chong said Tuesday that the waiver had \u201copened breathing room\u201d for South Korea\u2019s oil refining industry, which relies on imports of a very light crude oil called condensate.\n\nThe waiver also is a relief for South Korean companies that export to Iran: The U.S. also agreed to uphold a special transaction system set up in October 2010 after discussions between Washington and Seoul that essentially allows South Korea to take Iranian oil as payments for its goods.\n\nWith the U.S. upholding the transaction system, South Korean companies will be able to continue exporting non-sanctioned items to Iran, officials said.\n\nIndia has a similar arrangement whereby Iran can use crude oil to pay for food and other necessities.\n\nFor both Japan and China, Iran is a significant but not huge supplier. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Russia, Qatar and Kuwait export more crude oil to Japan than Iran.\n\nChina is the single-largest importer of crude oil, at about 9 million barrels a day, and also of Iranian oil, so cutting off all shipments could have jolted global markets.\n\nBut China has diversified and relies on Iran for less than 10 percent of its total crude oil imports, with Saudi Arabia, Angola, Russia, Oman and Iraq providing more than half, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Mari Yamaguchi in Tokyo and Elaine Kurtenbach in Bangkok contributed.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Carlos Barria/Reuters)\n\nSince news of the \u201cmigrant caravan\u201d broke in mid-October, President Trump has made immigration the focal issue in the upcoming midterms, calling this the \u201celection of the caravan.\u201d Trump has claimed that the caravan is composed of criminals, that it includes individuals from the Middle East and that migrants could be shot by the U.S. military if they act aggressively.\n\nThe strategy, it seems, is to stoke xenophobic fears to court Republican votes and remind voters about his promise to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, a signature, yet unfulfilled, Trump campaign pledge from the 2016 election.\n\nWill these tactics help Republicans going into Tuesday\u2019s elections? Our data suggests that the answer is no. But more than that, after Tuesday, Republicans in Congress may find it difficult to deliver on an issue that Trump has now doubled down on: immigration reform.\n\n[5 reasons to be concerned about deploying U.S. troops along the southern border]\n\nHow we did our research\n\nGiven Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant rhetoric, we might expect to see that the relationship between immigration attitudes and midterm vote intentions increased during the 2018 campaign season. To test this possibility, we analyzed data from our nationally representative panel survey of likely voters. This survey, fielded for us by NORC at the University of Chicago, is unique because the same respondents indicated their vote intentions and answered the same three questions measuring immigration attitudes in early July and again in late October.\n\nSpecifically, we asked the same 957 likely voters whether they support or oppose building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, whether recent immigration will take jobs away from people already here, and whether \u201cillegal immigrants\u201d living in the United States should be allowed to stay and apply for citizenship. Because we measured immigration attitudes well before (survey fielded July 3-12) and just after Trump\u2019s attacks on the migrant caravan began (survey fielded Oct. 19-29), if Trump\u2019s comments are affecting immigration attitudes, we should be able to detect it.\n\nTo test how immigration attitudes relate to vote intention, we combined responses to the three immigration questions into an overall \u201canti-immigration\u201d index and used this to predict intention to vote for a Republican or Democrat in the upcoming House elections. Not surprisingly, anti-immigration attitudes were a significant predictor of Republican vote intentions at both time points.\n\n[Majorities of millennials who plan to vote support Democrats \u2014 except among white men]\n\nHere\u2019s the key question: Were anti-immigration attitudes a stronger predictor of vote intentions in late October than in early July? If Trump\u2019s caravan rhetoric was in fact leading voters to draw upon their immigration attitudes when deciding their voting preferences, we\u2019d expect a stronger relationship in our October data.\n\nThis was not the case. The relationship between immigration attitudes and vote intentions was statistically equivalent at both time points. This means that despite Trump\u2019s recent fixation on immigration, we find no evidence that likely voters changed how much they base their vote choice on their immigration attitudes.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that the goal of these anti-immigration statements is to bring out the Republican vote. Our research design also lets us test this possibility. In the late-October survey, we randomly selected 136 respondents who had previously indicated that they were not likely to vote but who now indicated that they were likely to vote. This could be an important group for Trump, who has cast the midterm elections as a \u201creferendum\u201d on his presidency to date.\n\n[A new poll shows the secret truth of 2018: Not much has changed in months]\n\nStrikingly, we find that the relationship between immigration attitudes and vote intention is even weaker for this group. In other words, the vote intentions of those just tuning into the midterms don\u2019t seem to be any more driven by immigration attitudes than those who have been likely voters from the start.\n\nA third possibility is that Trump has made likely voters more anti-immigration. If that\u2019s the case, Trump could still benefit even though the relationship between immigration attitudes and vote intentions has not changed. To test for a Trump effect on immigration attitudes, we compared the percentage of likely voters who endorsed anti-immigration views in the July and October surveys. Across all three questions, anti-immigration views were highly stable; no statistical differences emerged.\n\nAlthough Republicans expressed much more opposition to immigration than Democrats, the attitudes of both partisan groups remained stable over time. Nor did late-breaking likely voters (those who were in our original sample but didn\u2019t pass our screening criteria until October) express different immigration attitudes compared with early likely voters. To summarize, there is no evidence in our data that Trump\u2019s recent rhetoric is influencing immigration attitudes or how these attitudes relate to vote intentions.\n\nHow Trump\u2019s rhetoric may hurt Republicans\n\nBut these results don\u2019t mean that Trump\u2019s words have no effect of any kind. In fact, our data shows that immigration has become very salient to many in Trump\u2019s base. In our October survey, we asked: \u201cAfter the midterm election, what is the single most important issue for Congress to address?\u201d Responses ranged widely \u2014 from health care to inequality, education and racism \u2014 but immigration-related responses stood out, particularly among Trump supporters.\n\nIf immigration is important to U.S. voters, how will this play out? Our findings may spell trouble for Republicans, in that immigration is a salient issue but that attitudes toward immigration have remained stable overall and in relation to vote choice between early July and late October. The GOP has been unable to enact immigration reform even though it controls the House, Senate and White House. Now, despite historical lows in undocumented immigration, Trump has focused his base on immigration \u2014 with no apparent electoral benefit.\n\nIf the \u201cblue wave\u201d washes over the United States on Tuesday, Republicans in Congress may soon be wishing that the president had rallied behind a different issue.\n\nPeter K.

Health authorities in Thailand are racing to contain a measles outbreak in the country\u2019s southern provinces, where 14 deaths and more than 1,500 cases have been reported since September. (Leo Correa, File/Associated Press)\n\nBANGKOK \u2014 Health authorities in Thailand are racing to contain a measles outbreak in the country\u2019s southern provinces, where 14 deaths and more than 1,500 cases have been reported since September.\n\nOfficials blame the comeback of the disease on low vaccination rates in the south caused by misconceptions among the Muslim population about the nature of the vaccine.\n\nIslam prohibits the consumption of pork, and vaccine makers sometimes use gelatin derived from pork products as a stabilizing agent. However, health official Vicharn Pawan said Thailand imports measles vaccine products that do not contain porcine gelatin.\n\nThe recent cases in Buddhist-dominated Thailand\u2019s Muslim-majority southern provinces represent half the total for the whole country since the beginning of the year.\n\nMeasles cases nationwide have increased in recent years, Thailand\u2019s Health Ministry said. Last year, nearly 3,000 cases \u2014 with no deaths \u2014 were reported, compared to just over 1,000 in 2012. According to the U.N.\u2019s World Health Organization, this year Japan and Brazil have also reported measles outbreaks, while Europe experienced a surge in 2017 with more than 20,000 cases and 35 deaths.\n\n\u201cIncreasingly, there is a lot of misunderstanding about vaccinations that spread around Muslim communities here. Some said it is against their religion to receive vaccine shots, while others think it\u2019s not safe,\u201d said Anchanee Heemmina, a rights activist who lives in an affected area in the south.\n\nThe Indonesian Ulema Council, the religious body governing the world\u2019s largest Muslim population, had to deal with the same problem earlier this year when some local Muslim groups declared their opposition to the vaccine. It ruled that Muslims were allowed to use such vaccines out of necessity until other options were available. Its statement came after a measles outbreak in Indonesia\u2019s eastern province of Papua was believed responsible for the deaths of as many as 100 children.\n\nThe Indonesian controversy may be responsible for the concerns among Muslims in Thailand and other countries.\n\nAccording to the Thai Health Ministry\u2019s Prevention and Control office, the misunderstandings about vaccinations have resulted in some areas in which only 60 percent of the population receives immunizations.\n\nFor highly contagious diseases such as measles, the World Health Organization says at least 95 percent of the population must be vaccinated for a community to be considered immune to the spread of the disease.\n\nHealth authorities in Thailand have posted messages from local religious leaders on their websites urging people to accept vaccinations.\n\nOne video message from the Central Islamic Council of Thailand explains that even if vaccines contain religiously prohibited items, the medical benefit to a person and the community would take precedence.\n\nHealth workers meanwhile are visiting schools and homes in areas with measles outbreaks to target children under age 5 for free vaccinations, offering them also to others who are judged vulnerable. They are also trying to spread the word that Islamic religious bodies have given their approval for the use of such vaccines, said Vicharn Pawan, director of the Health Ministry\u2019s Bureau of Risk Communication and Health Behavior.\n\nResistance has not been overcome. Twenty families from three villages in Yala province refused vaccinations, with 10 of the families signing formal letters stating their intention to not receive any immunizations in the future, public broadcaster ThaiPBS reported Monday.\n\nYala\u2019s public health office said in a statement that its medical teams will continue to work in the communities to address their concerns.\n\n\u201cWe are still facing tough tasks,\u201d said Vicharn. \u201cBut health workers will continue to reach out to communities. Even if they refuse vaccinations this time around, we will have to keep up the visits and continue to deliver the message that vaccines are good for their health and their community.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The bodies of two men and another woman were found earlier in the day.\n\nSeveral people remained missing after the adjacent multi-story structures collapsed Monday.\n\nFrench Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said \u201cair pockets\u201d under the debris meant there\u2019s \u201chope to locate and find someone that can be saved.\u201d\n\nCastaner said at the site that 120 police officers and 80 firefighters took part in the search-and-rescue operation, working day and night in the pile of beams and rubble.\n\nThe two buildings, one apparently vacant and the other housing apartments, collapsed Monday at 9 a.m. local time, in a street close to Marseille\u2019s famous Old Port on the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nAuthorities said the vacant building had been deemed substandard. It was not immediately clear why they collapsed, or how many people the apartment building housed.\n\nFire crews working with sniffer dogs later brought down the remains of a third building they feared could topple over on them.\n\nImages of the buildings before they collapsed showed that one had five floors and the other six. In the spot where they had stood, a large gap appeared once the dust and debris settled.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

He appeared alert and attentive as presiding judge Rainer Brackhane asked him questions, answering in slow, concise sentences.\n\nRehbogen is accused of working as a guard at the camp east of Danzig, which is today the Polish city of Gdansk, from June 1942 to about early September 1944.\n\nThere is no evidence linking him to a specific crime, but over 60,000 people were killed at Stutthof and prosecutors argue that as a guard, he was an accessory to at least hundreds of those deaths.\n\nThe retired civil servant showed no reaction as prosecutor Andreas Brendel read the accusations against him, detailing the horrific way prisoners at Stutthof were killed. Some were given lethal injections of gasoline or phenol directly to their hearts, shot or starved. Others were forced outside in winter without clothes until they died of exposure, or put to death in the gas chamber.\n\n\u201cAnyone who heard the screams from outside the gas chamber would have known that people were fighting for their lives,\u201d Brendel said.\n\n\n\nA former 94-year-old SS guard holds his walking stick at the beginning of a trial in Muenster, Germany, Tuesday, Nov.6, 2018. He is charged of accessory to murder for serving at the Nazis\u2019 Stutthof concentration camp. (Guido Kirchner/dpa via AP) (Associated Press)\n\nRehbogen, a former SS Sturmmann \u2014 roughly equivalent to the U.S. Army rank of specialist \u2014 does not deny serving in the camp during the war, but has told investigators he was unaware of the killings and did not participate in them.\n\nNo pleas are entered in Germany and Andreas Tinkl, one of Rehbogen\u2019s attorneys, would not comment on his client\u2019s defense. He said Rehbogen would address the court at some point during the trial, which is scheduled into January.\n\nRehbogen lives in Borken, near the Dutch border. In deference to his age and health, the trial is being restricted to a maximum of two hours a day, on no more than two non-consecutive days a week. At the same time, because he was under 21 at the time of his alleged crimes, he is being tried in juvenile court and faces a maximum 10 years in prison if convicted.\n\nSeventeen Stutthof survivors or relatives of victims have joined the trial as co-plaintiffs, but Brendel said it was unclear whether any would testify in person due to their ages.\n\nIn one of several statements read by their attorneys, survivor Judy Meisel remembered being forced by the Germans into a ghetto at age 12, where she said she endured hunger, daily humiliation and terror.\n\n\u201cBut I was not prepared for what came next,\u201d said Meisel, who today lives in Minneapolis. \u201cNext came Stutthof and I experienced the unimaginable, the hell organized and executed by the SS.\u201d\n\nRehbogen, who was given headphones so he could clearly follow the testimony, showed no reaction as Meisel said the last time she saw her mother, they were both standing among a group of naked women about to be forced into the gas chamber, before she herself was able to break away.\n\n\u201cStutthof was organized mass murder through the SS, made possible through the help of the guards,\u201d she said.\n\nBen Cohen, Meisel\u2019s grandson who came from New York to attend the trial, said hearing her statement with one of her former captors in the same room was both important and moving.\n\n\u201cI know her story so well it is emotional every time I hear it, but it takes on more importance than my own emotions now,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Simon Wiesenthal Center, which helped locate Stutthof survivors for the case, stressed that even more than 70 years after the end of World War II it is not too late to pursue justice.\n\n\u201cThe passage of time in no way diminishes the guilt of Holocaust perpetrators and old age should not afford protection to those who committed such heinous crimes,\u201d said the center\u2019s head Nazi hunter, Efraim Zuroff.\n\nEven though the number of suspects is dwindling, the special federal prosecutor\u2019s office that investigates Nazi war crimes still has multiple cases ongoing.\n\nThe legal reasoning that being a camp guard is itself enough to be found guilty of accessory to murder, even without specific evidence of a crime, was first used successfully against former Ohio autoworker John Demjanjuk in 2011.\n\nDemjanjuk was convicted on allegations he served as a Sobibor death camp guard. He denied the accusation and died before his appeal could be heard.\n\nThe 2015 conviction of former Auschwitz guard Oskar Groening using the same argument, however, was upheld by Germany\u2019s top criminal court on appeal.\n\nThe Stutthof case is the first use of this reasoning for a concentration camp guard instead of a death camp guard. But prosecutors have expressed confidence it can be applied, since tens of thousands of people were killed in Stutthof even though its sole purpose was not murder.\n\nStutthof was established in 1939 and was initially used as the main collection point for Jews and non-Jewish Poles removed from nearby Danzig.\n\nFrom about 1940, it was used as a so-called \u201cwork education camp\u201d where forced laborers, primarily Polish and Soviet citizens, were sent to serve sentences and often died. Others incarcerated there included criminals, political prisoners, homosexuals and Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses.\n\nFrom mid-1944, it was filled with tens of thousands of Jews from ghettos being cleared by the Nazis in the Baltics as well as from Auschwitz, and thousands of Polish civilians swept up in the brutal suppression of the Warsaw uprising.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Matthew Emmons/USA Today)\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys, even with their record below .500, took their shot at the NFC East title when they traded a first-round draft pick to the Oakland Raiders for wide receiver Amari Cooper. It seemed to make sense. The Cowboys desperately needed a No. 1 wideout, and the division race was wide open, with the first-place Washington Redskins looking less than overpowering and the Philadelphia Eagles sorting through issues.\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t matter how wide open the division race is if you\u2019re not winning.\n\nCooper made his debut for the Cowboys in Monday night\u2019s game at home against the Tennessee Titans. He had some decent moments, giving the Cowboys an early lead with a first-quarter touchdown catch. But it wasn\u2019t enough. Not even close. The Dallas offense continued to sputter badly. And the Cowboys reached the midway point of their season in a desperate state after losing to the Titans, 28-14.\n\n\u201cReally disappointing,\u201d Cowboys owner Jerry Jones told reporters after the game. \u201cWe certainly didn\u2019t see this coming.\u201d\n\n[Cowboys owner Jerry Jones isn't planning to make a coaching change. Make of that what you will.]\n\nThe Cowboys (3-5) are two games behind the Redskins and a game in back of the Eagles. That\u2019s not so daunting.\n\nBut the Cowboys aren\u2019t playing well, as their record suggests. They\u2019ve lost two straight and three of four games. They fell to the Redskins at FedEx Field just before their bye week, and just before completing the Cooper trade. With the bye week to rest and prepare, with time to work Cooper into the offense, they delivered a clunker Monday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really not good enough,\u201d Coach Jason Garrett said at his postgame news conference. \u201cWe had some early opportunities that we didn\u2019t cash in on\u2026. Ultimately they did more to win the game than we did.\u201d\n\nThe biggest issues are on offense. Quarterback Dak Prescott threw for 243 yards and two touchdowns, the four-yarder to Cooper in the first quarter and a 23-yarder to wide receiver Allen Hurns in the final minute of the first half that tied the game at 14. Prescott also had two costly turnovers, throwing a first-quarter interception in the end zone when the Cowboys could have added to their lead and losing a third-quarter fumble that led to Tennessee\u2019s go-ahead touchdown.\n\n[Steelers continue \u2018Le\u2019Veon who?\u2019 portion of season with a critical win over Ravens]\n\nPrescott has become a turnover-prone quarterback, which was not the case during his superb rookie season in 2016 when he and tailback Ezekiel Elliott led the Cowboys to the top seed in the NFC playoffs. But Prescott, Elliott and the Cowboys have not recaptured that magic from their rookie year, when their postseason ended with a loss at home to the Green Bay Packers but the future nevertheless seemed so promising.\n\nLast season came undone when Elliott missed six games while serving his suspension under the NFL\u2019s personal conduct policy, delayed for half the season as he and the NFL Players Association fought the penalty in court. This year, the Cowboys figured having Elliott back in the lineup for a full season would lead to success. It hasn\u2019t. Tight end Jason Witten retired to ESPN\u2019s \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d broadcast booth. The Cowboys cut ties with wide receiver Dez Bryant. Prescott has not been able to get the passing game revved up.\n\nThe Cowboys failed to generate much of a running game Monday, as Elliott was limited to 61 rushing yards on 17 carries. Offensive coordinator Scott Linehan fell into his familiar patterns. The Cowboys would run the ball on first down and not gain many yards. From there, Prescott would face pass-rush pressure by the Titans. The results weren\u2019t good.\n\nThe Cowboys were shut out in the second half. Cooper finished with five catches for 58 yards. It wasn\u2019t a bad debut. But the Cowboys will need more for giving up a first-round draft choice to seem justified.\n\nThe Dallas defense has been good this season, and it benefited Monday from two early turnovers by the Titans. But Tennessee quarterback Marcus Mariota settled down from there and played pretty well, running for a touchdown and throwing for two others. Cowboys linebacker Sean Lee limped off the field with a hamstring injury. The Titans became the first team to score more than 24 points against the Cowboys this season.\n\n\n\nCoach Jason Garrett doesn't have the answers as the Cowboys' record dropped to 3-5. (Matthew Emmons/USA Today)\n\nThe speculation undoubtedly will increase that the Cowboys are about to fire Garrett or Linehan, or both. But that type of talk is common, and it hasn\u2019t happened yet. Jones told reporters Monday night that he would not consider an in-season coaching change. Jones has been extremely patient with Garrett, with some within the league speculating it\u2019s because Garrett allows Jones to have so much say into how the team operates on the field.\n\nThe Cowboys play at Philadelphia on Sunday night. That begins a five-game stretch in which they face the Atlanta Falcons on the road, then have three straight home games against the Redskins (on Thanksgiving), the New Orleans Saints and the Eagles. By the time that stretch ends, the Cowboys could be back in contention in the NFC East.\n\nOr the competitive portion of their season could be done, and all that would be left would be contemplating the futures in Dallas of Garrett and Prescott and wondering why the Cowboys traded away their first-round draft choice on what they should have suspected was a lost cause.\n\nRead more NFL coverage:\n\nDez Bryant, Brandon Marshall reportedly set for workouts with Saints\n\nMichael Irvin erupts at Stephen A.

(Ebrahim Noroozi/Associated Press)\n\nTEHRAN, Iran \u2014 The \u201clargest-ever\u201d U.S. sanctions list targeting Iran drew mockery from Iranian officials on Tuesday for including mothballed Boeing 747s, a bank that closed years earlier and a sunken oil tanker that exploded off China months ago.\n\nHowever, the new list of sanctions, which also aims to cut Iran\u2019s vital oil industry off from international sales, also included for the first time its state airline and its atomic energy commission, further highlighting the maximalist approach of President Donald Trump\u2019s administration.\n\nTrump pulled America out of the 2015 nuclear deal Iran struck with world powers in May. United Nations monitors say Iran still abides by the deal, in which it agreed to limit its uranium enrichment in return for the lifting of international sanctions.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury Department imposed penalties on more than 700 Iranian and Iranian-linked individuals, entities, aircraft and vessels in the new sanctions. Among those are 50 Iranian banks and subsidiaries, and more than 200 people and ships.\n\nHowever, scattered among the list are surprising entries, like the crude oil tanker Sanchi. That vessel collided with a bulk freighter and caught fire off China\u2019s east coast in January, killing all 32 sailors aboard.\n\nAnother entry was Iran\u2019s Tat Bank, which closed in 2012.\n\nForeign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif took to Twitter to mock some of the targets of the sanctions, describing it as a \u201cdesperate\u201d psychological ploy.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. designated a bank that was closed 6 years ago, and a ship that sank . in a widely televised saga,\u201d he wrote, ending the tweet with \u201c(hashtag)USisIsolated.\u201d\n\nBut for the first time, the United States targeted Iran Air. It also sanctioned the state carrier\u2019s mothballed fleet of Boeing 747s, which were manufactured in the 1970s.\n\nIt also appeared that the U.S., in another first, was directly sanctioning the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, the government agency that oversees Iran\u2019s nuclear program. Prior sanctions targeted specific subsidiaries of the organization.\n\nEshaq Jahangiri, President Hassan Rouhani\u2019s senior vice president, also criticized the sanctions.\n\n\u201cAmericans think their list is more effective if it is longer,\u201d Jahangiri said, according to the state-run IRNA news agency. He said he had discussed the list with other officials, with many saying it was \u201cless than what we expected.\u201d\n\nStill, Jahangiri warned that \u201cAmericans intend to damage economy of the country\u201d through psychological warfare.\n\nZarif later issued an online video criticizing America\u2019s \u201cindiscriminate assault\u201d on his country.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. administration appears to believe that imposing illegal draconian sanctions on Iran will bring about such pain to our nation that it will force us to submit to its will, no matter how absurd, unlawful or fundamentally flawed its demands are.\u201d\n\nZarif urged America to re-examine its \u201ccatastrophes\u201d in the Mideast, including its support for Saudi Arabia and Israel.\n\nIran is already in the grip of an economic crisis. Its national currency, the rial, now trades at 150,000 to one U.S. dollar; a year ago, it was about 40,500. The economic chaos sparked mass anti-government protests at the end of last year, resulting in nearly 5,000 reported arrests and at least 25 people being killed.\n\nSporadic smaller demonstrations still reportedly erupt from time to time.\n\nThe new sanctions particularly hurt Iran\u2019s vital oil industry, which provides a crucial source of hard currency. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the sanctions already had cost Iran the sale of over 1 million barrels of crude oil a day.\n\nAnalysts feared in the run-up to the sanctions that global oil prices could spike on tight supply and increasing demand. However, the Trump administration allowed some of its allies \u2014 Greece, India, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Turkey \u2014 as well as rival China to continue to purchase Iranian oil as long as they work to reduce imports to zero. The price of benchmark Brent crude has dropped from over $80 a barrel in recent days.\n\nDuring a visit to Madrid on Tuesday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the U.S. decision to re-impose sanctions on Iran was \u201cnot legitimate\u201d and that the rest of the parties to the 2015 nuclear deal abandoned by Washington are working to make economic cooperation with Tehran possible.\n\nLavrov\u2019s remarks were Russia\u2019s first reaction to Washington\u2019s new list of sanctions against Iran. The Russian diplomat said the sanctions go against international law and practices, and that the U.S. \u201cpolicies of issuing an ultimatum and making unilateral moves are unacceptable these days.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Aritz Parra in Madrid contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

They targeted more than 700 Iranian individuals, banks, aircraft and maritime vessels, all with the explicit goal of ultimately reducing Iran\u2019s oil exports to zero. Foreign companies and governments that seek to circumvent these measures risk being sanctioned themselves.\n\nFor the Trump administration, which unilaterally withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal earlier this year, it is the start of another campaign of \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d on what it views as a rogue regime. Hawks in the White House and Trump\u2019s Cabinet believe the sanctions will change Iran\u2019s behavior in the region. They have embarked on this course with the enthusiastic support of Israel and the Persian Gulf monarchies, all of whom want to see Iran forced to scale back support for its proxies throughout the Middle East.\n\n\u201cThe Iranian regime has a choice: It can either do a 180-degree turn from its outlaw course of action and act like a normal country, or it can see its economy crumble,\u201d Pompeo said on Monday.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s opponents argue the administration\u2019s strategy will punish ordinary Iranians while doing nothing to persuade their rulers. In the months since the White House pulled out of the nuclear accord, the Iranian economy has gone stagnant and its currency has tanked. Major multinational companies have either quit the country or extensively drawn down their operations out of fear of incurring U.S. penalties.\n\nThe International Crisis Group analyzed four decades of data on Iran\u2019s economic performance and found there was little correlation between its national-security policies and economic distress. \u201cThe Trump administration hopes that sanctions will force Iran to curb its regional activities. But data shows that outcome is uncertain as changes in Iran\u2019s wealth have had little impact on the direction or capabilities of its regional policy,\u201d the group noted in a report.\n\n\u201cLike much of Trump\u2019s foreign policy walking from Iran accord/piling on sanctions is great politics but not great policy,\u201d tweeted Aaron David Miller, a former U.S. diplomat, pointing to the vast difference between the administration\u2019s zeal to punish Iran and its willingness to accommodate North Korea. \u201cThe Iranian regime is a bad one; but only Trump can praise [North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un] \u2014 a true authoritarian and threatening nuclear power \u2014 and not see hypocrisy in his Iran policy.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Iran\u2019s leadership highlighted its continued adherence to the terms of the nuclear deal and decried the \u201cillegality\u201d of American actions. The European governments that signed the pact have also rallied in its defense. \u201cOur collective resolve to complete this work is unwavering,\u201d said diplomats from the European Union, Britain, France and Germany in a joint statement. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, who pushed for the deal after his election in 2014, vowed on Monday to \u201cproudly break the sanctions.\u201d\n\n\u201cIran is gaining ground in the region, and I don\u2019t see these sanctions as reversing that,\u201d said Jeffrey Feltman, a top State Department official on Middle East issues during the Obama administration, to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nIn fact, the sanctions may help Iran\u2019s hard-liners more than anyone. Analysts contend that the Iranian regime itself is well-insulated from the economic turmoil, and that its powerful Revolutionary Guard \u2014 the organization that also runs much of Iran\u2019s \u201cmalign activities\u201d in countries like Iraq and Syria \u2014 won\u2019t let the sanctions change its posture elsewhere. Indeed, it may feel emboldened to assert itself all the more in defiance.\n\nAs the International Crisis Group pointed out, the sanctions \u201crisk empowering harder-line officials in the Islamic Republic and prompting them to lash out, exacerbating regional tensions.\u201d That\u2019s a fear shared by the U.S.\u2019s European allies, who see Rouhani cowed by hard-line forces within the regime that never wanted rapprochement with the West.\n\nIn a phone call with reporters last week, Dennis Ross, a former U.S. diplomat who served three administrations, argued that the Obama administration had a far more extensive international coalition in place when it applied economic pressure on the Iranians a half-decade ago. That is not quite the case now, with the European Union exploring ways to shield European business with Iran from American censure \u2014 and Washington already issuing waivers to eight countries, including China and India, to carry on importing Iranian oil.\n\n\u201cThe Obama administration had a broad international consensus and coalition that worked hand in hand to ensure there wouldn\u2019t be evasion of the sanctioned regime,\u201d Ross said. \u201cThe Iranians are highly skilled in finding ways to evade the sanctions regime and we are not going to have a large number of partners who are going to be as vigilant as they might have been.\u201d\n\nTrump, experts say, may still be hoping for a repeat of his Singapore summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The Iranians, though, have shown no interest in treating with this U.S. president and may be intent on bunkering down and waiting out his presidency.\n\n\u201cTehran played by the rules and the United States broke its promises,\u201d wrote John Glaser of the libertarian Cato Institute. \u201cThey are not about to willingly pie themselves in the face again in response to new economic sanctions.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, ordinary Iranians will face the daily toll of sanctions: the shortages of life-saving medicines, the rising costs of basic goods, the steady degradation of the quality of their lives.\n\n\u201cToday, ordinary Iranians are struggling to answer the question of why sanctions are being re-imposed and why they must suffer,\u201d wrote Iran analyst Esfandyar Batmanghelidj. \u201cThe inevitability of this suffering, and its quotidian dimension, is what makes the U.S. financial war so pernicious.\u201d\n\nWant smart analysis of the most important news in your inbox every weekday along with other global reads, interesting ideas and opinions to know?

A shark killed a man near an island harbor on Australia\u2019s Great Barrier Reef on Monday, Nov. 5, 2018, officials said. (Channel 7/Channel 9 via AP) (Associated Press)\n\nCANBERRA, Australia \u2014 A shark killed a man in an island harbor on Australia\u2019s Great Barrier Reef where two tourists were mauled on consecutive days in September in a spate of attacks that has left authorities struggling to explain an apparent escalation in danger in an internationally renowned vacation destination.\n\nThe 33-year-old victim, Daniel Christidis, was among 10 friends who set out from Airlie Beach on the Queensland state mainland on Monday morning on a rented yacht to sail themselves on a five-day cruise through the idyllic Whitsunday Islands, Police Inspector Steve O\u2019Connell said.\n\nThey anchored 23 kilometers (14 miles) from Airlie Beach in Cid Harbor, intending to spend their first night in the popular, protected anchorage on Whitsunday Island, the uninhabited largest island in the group, he said.\n\nChristidis, a urologist from the city of Melbourne, was taking turns with a woman standing on a paddle board or swimming in the harbor late Monday afternoon. He had dived into the water to give the woman her turn on the board when he was attacked, O\u2019Connell said.\n\nThere were more than a dozen yachts in the harbor at the time. French-speaking tourists launched a dinghy from their yacht and rescued Chritidis, O\u2019Connell said.\n\nThey brought Christidis to his own yacht, where most of the group had medical backgrounds, including two doctors.\n\n\u201cDespite their best efforts, the injuries were too severe,\u201d O\u2019Connell told reporters.\n\nChristidis was taken by helicopter to the Mackay Base Hospital, 100 kilometers (60 miles) to the south, where he died.\n\n\u201cCPR was ongoing for a very long time and every solid effort was made to save that man\u2019s life,\u201d O\u2019Connell said, referring cardiopulmonary resuscitation.\n\n\u201cThey did everything imaginable to try to save the man. It\u2019s just \u2014 the injuries were so severe,\u201d he added.\n\nChristidis\u2019 employer, Austin Health, said the doctor was a research fellow.\n\nA 46-year-old tourist, Justine Barwick, was attacked on Sept. 19 while swimming from a yacht in Cid Harbor and is recovering. A 12-year-old tourist, Hannah Papps, was attacked in the same harbor while swimming from a yacht the next day, losing a leg.\n\nThe last shark attack in the Whitsunday Islands before the latest spate occurred on Feb. 13, 2010, off Dent Island where 60-year-old tourist Patricia Trumbull survived lacerations to her buttocks and major blood loss.\n\nTourism Whitsundays chief executive Peter O\u2019Reilly said at the time that the Trumbull attack was the first in the islands in 13 years and only the third ever recorded.\n\nDaniel Gschwind, chief executive of the Queensland Tourism Industry Council, which represents more than 3,000 tourism businesses, said on Tuesday that authorities were examining why the unprecedented series of attacks had occurred and whether environmental changes were a factor.\n\n\u201cWe need to now have the scientific background and investigation of what is causing this sudden spike of attacks and interactions with sharks. We simply do not know why this is occurring and what is responsible for it,\u201d Gschwind said.\n\nThe species of sharks involved in the attacks have not been identified.\n\nPolice and fisheries boats were patrolling Cid Harbor on Tuesday and advising tourists on yachts to keep out of the water, O\u2019Connell said.\n\nAuthorities killed six sharks in the Cid Harbor area in a week following the September attacks in a bid to reduce their numbers in the popular tourist location. Critics argued that killing sharks was not the answer.\n\nGschwind called for a science-based response to the latest tragedy.\n\nAustralia had not experienced a fatal shark attack since April 17 last year and it has averaged fewer than two deadly shark attacks per year in recent decades.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

More than a year after Hurricane Maria caught Puerto Rico\u2019s government wildly unprepared, officials acknowledge they still haven\u2019t come up with a plan to cope with the next such disaster and it\u2019s not clear when they will. (Gerald Herbert, File/Associated Press)\n\nSAN JUAN, Puerto Rico \u2014 More than a year after Hurricane Maria caught Puerto Rico\u2019s government wildly unprepared, officials acknowledge they still haven\u2019t come up with a plan to cope with the next such disaster \u2014 and it\u2019s not clear when they will.\n\nThe U.S. territory\u2019s government insisted for months that it had a complete, updated disaster plan, saying it was kept secret due to protect information about vulnerable infrastructure and officials\u2019 private contact details.\n\nBut a suit filed by Puerto Rico\u2019s Center for Investigative Journalism led officials to concede last month that that plan doesn\u2019t deal with catastrophic events such as hurricanes and earthquakes, prompting outrage on an island where many blame government bungling for the estimated 2,975 deaths linked to Category 4 Hurricane Maria, which hit in September 2017.\n\n\u201cThe government has clearly failed the people and hid the fact that the plan was under revision,\u201d said Nazario Lugo, a former executive director of Puerto Rico\u2019s emergency management agency and president of the island\u2019s Association of Emergency Managers.\n\n\u201cWe are talking about the lives of people. Someone is not going to react the way they\u2019re supposed to. This is a team effort, and when the team is not in tune, when it\u2019s not in position, it fails,\u201d he said. \u201cLives are lost.\u201d\n\nCarlos Acevedo, director of Puerto Rico\u2019s Bureau for Emergency and Disaster Management, did not respond to requests for comment about why the plan hasn\u2019t been updated.\n\nAt the Oct. 30 court hearing, government lawyer Tania Fernandez said she didn\u2019t know when the plan would be finished and made public because officials haven\u2019t yet hired experts to create such plans.\n\nA partial plan released by the government last month stresses the risks of poor preparation and blames previous administrations.\n\n\u201cThe consequences of Hurricane Maria made it clear that we did not have emergency plans that contemplated such scenarios, nor the sufficient resources to face catastrophic disasters of such historical magnitude,\u201d the document states.\n\nHowever, Lugo and another former emergency management agency director, Epifanio Jimenez, said Puerto Rico has had a plan for a Category 4 hurricane that was drawn up after Hurricane Hugo, a Category 3 storm, hit the island in 1989. They say Gov. Ricardo Rossello\u2019s administration failed to follow it.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re using the impact of Maria ... to justify the unjustifiable,\u201d Jimenez said of what many consider a botched government response to that storm. \u201cImprovisation is the worst enemy of emergency management, and we saw that.\u201d\n\nLugo and Jimenez said that emergency response was hindered by a lack of fuel and truck drivers, communication between local government agencies broke down, supplies weren\u2019t dispatched quickly enough and officials didn\u2019t know the immediate needs of each municipality.\n\nDespite the lack of a finished formal plan, local and federal officials have learned lessons from Maria and are more prepared than they were when that storm hit, according to Jesus Cuartas, an operational planning chief for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, who urged patience.\n\n\u201cWe are not racing for time,\u201d he said. \u201cAny plan that is simply rushed out the door ... the thought of that being viable is slim to none.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Tom Pennington/Getty Images)\n\nWhen Michael Thomas pulled a cellphone from the goal post after scoring Sunday against the Rams, was he trying to dial up some veteran help? Probably not, but reports Monday indicated the Saints could be looking to supplement Thomas\u2019s talents with some experience at wide receiver.\n\nAccording to NFL Network\u2019s Jane Slater, Dez Bryant is among three receivers set for workouts in New Orleans on Tuesday. Her colleague Ian Rapoport subsequently reported that Brandon Marshall would be among the group, with the third free agent as yet unidentified.\n\n[Michael Irvin erupts at Stephen A. Smith with sweat-soaked rant on Cowboys\u2019 greatness]\n\nBryant has been out of work since being released by the Cowboys in April, while Marshall was recently cut loose by the Seahawks. At ages 30 and 34, respectively, they will bring a combined 21 NFL seasons, nine Pro Bowl nods and 156 touchdown grabs to the reported workout.\n\nThe Saints, meanwhile, have a young star in the 25-year-old Thomas, who set a franchise record with 211 receiving yards during the 45-35 triumph over the previously undefeated Rams. However, apart from his 12 receptions in that game, New Orleans got just two catches for 23 yards from its other wide receivers, all by rookie Tre\u2019Quan Smith, even as Drew Brees threw for 346 yards and four touchdowns.\n\nSmith\u2019s playing time has grown in the wake of a knee injury that sent veteran wide receiver Ted Ginn to the injured reserve list, but the Saints have gotten little from offseason acquisition Cam Meredith and second-year receiver Austin Carr, who was an undrafted free agent. The team has another dangerous pass-catching threat in running back Alvin Kamara, but it may well be intrigued by the notion that Bryant, in particular, might have something left in the tank.\n\nIt likely didn\u2019t help that the Cowboys released Bryant a month into free agency, but he appeared to generate little interest on the market and may have made a major mistake by reportedly turning down a three-year contract offer from the Ravens.

Thousands of Central American migrants have arrived at the stadium, still hundreds of miles away from their goal of reaching the U.S. a day before midterm elections in which they unwittingly became a central issue. (Marco Ugarte/Associated Press)\n\nMEXICO CITY \u2014 Humanitarian aid converged around a stadium in Mexico City where thousands of Central American migrants winding their way toward the United States were resting Tuesday after an arduous trek that has taken them through three countries in three weeks.\n\nMexico City Mayor Jose Ramon Amieva said 4,500 migrants have arrived at the Jesus Martinez stadium since Sunday, and city officials are bracing to attend as many as 5,500 at the site by Wednesday. Hundreds of city employees and even more volunteers were on hand to sort donations and direct migrants toward food, water, diapers and other basics.\n\nMigrants searched through piles of donated clothes, grabbed boxes of milk for children and lined up to make quick calls home at a stand set up by the Red Cross as U.S. voters went to the polls for midterm elections in which President Donald Trump has made the migrant caravan a central issue.\n\nEmployees from the capital\u2019s human rights commission registered new arrivals with biographical data\u2014 such as age and country of origin\u2014 and placed yellow bracelets on wrists to keep count.\n\nRina Valenzuela wore one of the yellow bracelets as she sat attentively listening to aid workers from the nonprofit Institute for Women in Migration explain the difficulties of applying for and securing asylum in the U.S. Valenzuela, who is from El Salvador, decided she\u2019s better off applying for refuge in Mexico.\n\n\u201cWhy go fight there, with as much effort and as much suffering as we have gone through, just for them to turn me back? Well, no,\u201d she said.\n\nThe aid workers explained that the asylum process in the U.S. could take years, with no guarantee of approval.\n\nHonduran Antonio Perez listened to the warnings but said he remains determined to continue north.\n\n\u201cThis is interesting but tough news,\u201d he reflected. \u201cBut neither this nor Donald Trump is going to stop me.\u201d\n\nThe atmosphere at the stadium was more institutional and organized than what migrants encountered on the road, where townspeople pushed bags of drinking water, tacos and fruit into their hands as they passed through tiny hamlets in southern Mexico.\n\nBut there were signs Tuesday that the stadium was already nearing its capacity to hold 6,000 people.\n\nMaria Yesenia Perez, 41, said there was no space in the stadium when she and her 8-year-old daughter arrived during the night, so the two from Honduras slept on the grass outside. Migrants pitched tents in the parking lot and constructed makeshift shelters from plywood covered with blankets and tarps. Forty portable toilets were scattered across the grass.\n\nThe stadium\u2019s enclosed space and government intervention makes it difficult for aid workers to reach the migrants, said Nancy Rojas, an Oxfam charity worker who has accompanied the migrants for weeks.\n\nFour big tents have been set up for women and children to sleep under with thin mattresses and blankets, while men were relegated Monday night to concrete bleachers. Temperatures dropped below 52 degrees Fahrenheit (11 Celsius) during the night in a city some 7,300 feet (2,240 meters) above sea level and still hundreds of miles from the U.S. border.\n\nSeveral smaller groups were trailing hundreds of miles to the south. Mexico City Mayor Amieva said the city needs to \u201creinforce\u201d to meet the needs of the migrants, especially vulnerable children and pregnant women.\n\nMexico City\u2019s central market supplied 3.5 tons of bananas and guavas to refuel the crowd, plus 600 bottles of water. The human rights commission said it planned to set up more tents and eating areas.\n\nMany of the migrants sought treatment for blistered and aching feet, respiratory infections, diarrhea and other maladies. City officials administered vaccines for tetanus and influenza.\n\nTrump has seized on the caravan as an election issue and portrayed it as a major threat, though such caravans have sprung up regularly over the years and largely passed unnoticed.\n\nHe ordered thousands of troops to the U.S.-Mexico border, vowed to detain asylum seekers in tents cities and insinuated without proof that there are criminals or even terrorists in the group.\n\nIn dozens of interviews since the initial caravan set out from Honduras more than three weeks ago, migrants have said they are escaping poverty and rampant violence. Many are families traveling with small children. Some say they left because they were threatened by gang members or had lost relatives to gang violence. Others say they hope to work, secure a good education for their children and send money to support relatives back home.\n\nWalkiria Viamney, 19, said she and her husband have relatives in Tijuana and California who have promised to help them cross into the United States. The pair from Honduras hoped to soon advance northward, although they relished the opportunity to rest and wash clothes in the stadium.\n\nNot far from Viamney, men played cards and chess while children ran between inflatable games. Others gave themselves sponge baths or lounged in the shade of improvised tents.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been here for three days already, and I\u2019m already rested. I want to move on,\u201d said Francisco Redondo, 40, a Honduran who said he worked construction for 12 years in California.\n\nOrganizers are urging members of the caravan already in Mexico City to await the arrival of stragglers and perhaps even the other caravans further back. The idea is to find strength in numbers. The outpouring of support for the caravan that first set out from Honduras on Oct. 13 has inspired thousands of others to march north from Central America.\n\nMexico City is more than 600 miles (1,000 kilometers) from the nearest U.S. border crossing at McAllen, Texas. A caravan last spring opted for a much longer route to Tijuana in the far northwest, across from San Diego. That caravan steadily dwindled to only about 200 people by the time it reached the border.\n\nEdgar Corzo, an official with the National Human Rights Commission, said that based on experiences with previous migrant caravans, the group probably will begin to break up now that it is in the capital.\n\n\u201cEach one goes to the place that he considers best,\u201d mainly wherever is closest to where they have relatives or friends already in the United States, he said.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The Trump administration is announcing the reimposition of all U.S. sanctions on Iran that had been lifted under the 2015 nuclear deal. The Trump administration is announcing the reimposition of all U.S. sanctions on Iran that had been lifted under the 2015 nuclear deal. (Associated Press)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration was caught between allies at home and abroad and the reality of global economics as it reinstated sanctions Monday on Iran, forced to carve out exemptions for important allies and back off on measures that could have been even more punishing for Tehran.\n\nThe U.S. granted waivers to allow China and seven close U.S. partners and allies to continue importing Iranian crude and other petroleum products without penalty, bowing to concerns that a complete end to Iran\u2019s exports would cause a major spike in world oil prices and cause other economic disruptions. Trump conceded that reality on his way to a last-minute campaign event a day before critical midterm congressional elections.\n\n\u201cWe have the toughest sanctions ever imposed but on oil we want to go a little bit slower because I don\u2019t want to drive the oil prices in the world,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cI could get the Iran oil down to zero immediately, but it would cause a shock to the market.\u201d\n\nThe newly reinstated sanctions target Iran\u2019s energy, financial and shipping sectors and are aimed at forcing Iran to end ballistic missile program and end its support for armed movements throughout the Middle East.\n\nThe measures restore all the U.S. sanctions that had been lifted under the 2015 accord that gave Iran billions of dollars in sanctions relief in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program, a deal that Obama administration critics had argued was too soft on the Islamic Republic.\n\nIn reinstating the measures, the Treasury Department imposed penalties on more than 700 Iranian and Iranian-linked individuals, entities, aircraft and vessels. Among those are 50 Iranian banks and subsidiaries, more than 200 people and ships, Iran\u2019s state-run airline Iran Air and more than 65 of its planes.\n\nThe sanctions freeze any assets that those targeted have in U.S. jurisdictions and bar Americans from doing business with them. They will also affect non-Iranian companies that deal with sanctioned Iranian firms and officials.\n\nYet, while the administration seeks to cut off Iran\u2019s oil revenue, it is allowing Greece, India, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Turkey to continue purchasing Iranian oil as long as they work to reduce imports to zero.\n\n\u201cWhen I look at the list, it\u2019s obviously very large economies that still in many ways depend on Iran oil imports and at this time don\u2019t have any strong alternatives,\u201d said Brian Katulis, a senior fellow at Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank.\n\n\u201cThis is part of the Trump team\u2019s trying to balance its maximum pressure campaign against Iran versus its concerns over where the global prices of oil might go and how that could negatively impact everyone including America. I don\u2019t support this policy, but if you are going down this path, it\u2019s a way to lessen the risk of economic blowback in America.\u201d\n\nThree of the eight waiver recipients \u2014 Greece, Italy and Turkey \u2014 are members of NATO. Japan and South Korea have mutual defense treaties with the U.S. and have a key part in the North Korea denuclearization initiative. India, the world\u2019s largest democracy, plays a critical role in the administration\u2019s \u201cIndo-Pacific\u201d strategy, which seeks to unite countries in the region into forming a bloc to counter China\u2019s growing assertiveness.\n\nAll of them lobbied heavily to be granted the six-month exemptions while promising to further reduce or end their imports and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the waivers were based on the specific circumstances of each and the need \u201cto ensure a well-supplied oil market.\u201d\n\nChina is the single-largest importer of Iranian oil and forcing it to look elsewhere to fuel its dynamic economy would likely have rocked the market.\n\nFor some waiver recipients, domestic concerns were paramount.\n\nSouth Korea, for example, is reliant on oil imports to drive its economy. It had been consultation with the Trump administration since the U.S. pullout from the Iran nuclear deal in May. Seoul says it will reduce oil imports from Iran by a \u201csignificant\u201d amount but the waiver will allow it to maintain a stable supply of a light form of crude known as condensate.\n\nSeeking to deflect criticism from some Iran hawks concerned that the sanctions don\u2019t go far enough, Pompeo stressed that U.S. pressure on countries to stop buying Iranian oil had already reduced its exports by more than a million barrels of crude per day costing the country $2.5 billion revenue.\n\nSome leading Iran hawks appeared to agree with the administration\u2019s approach.\n\n\u201cWe are encouraged that these waivers will only be temporary and one-time,\u201d said United Against a Nuclear Iran, a prominent group that was harshly critical of the nuclear deal and the sanctions relief it brought.\n\nIn addition to the oil exemptions, Pompeo said limited waivers had been issued to allow European and other firms to continue conversion work on three of Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities.\n\n\u201cPermitting these specific activities to continue is an interim measure that preserves oversight of Iran\u2019s civil nuclear program,\u201d the State Department said. \u201cThis oversight enhances our ability to constrain Iran\u2019s program and keep pressure on the regime while we pursue a new, stronger deal.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMaria Danilova and Matthew Pennington contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Smith\u2019s job is, in many ways, to push buttons, and he arrived Monday at an entertainment and event center located near the Cowboys' AT&T Stadium ready to do just that. As it turned out, the star of ESPN\u2019s \u201cFirst Take\u201d didn\u2019t just get under the skin of the dozens of Dallas fans in attendance, but he also provoked quite the eruption from former Cowboys wide receiver Michael Irvin.\n\nNow an NFL Network analyst, Irvin makes no pretense of disguising his loyalty to the organization he helped win three Super Bowls, but as Smith noted before the Cowboys hosted the Titans on \u201cMonday Night Football,\u201d the glory days in Dallas are long over and the team has fallen well behind some other NFL franchises.\n\nThat was too much to bear for Irvin, who quickly required some towels to help with the considerable sweat he worked up while shouting about how the Cowboys were set to \u201crightfully regain and take their proper spot among kings!\u201d\n\nIrvin began what rapidly turned into a rant by claiming that the \u201cchampionship trophies\u201d possessed by the Cowboys put them \u201cright up there with the Patriots and the Steelers.\u201d He stood up and pointed at Smith, shouting as the crowd cheered, \u201cSo when you go to history, let\u2019s go into history! Don\u2019t just go to your history, let\u2019s go into the history!\"\n\n\u201cFirst Take\u201d co-analyst Max Kellerman then asked Irvin if Dak Prescott was the right quarterback to \u201cmake some history\u201d with the Cowboys, to which the ex-player pointed to Dallas\u2019s recent trade for former Raiders wide receiver Amari Cooper as the key to unlocking a bright future. \u201cCan you really get an answer on Dak without giving him the weapons around him,\u201d Irvin said. \u201cI think that\u2019s why Amari Cooper was a big deal.\u201d\n\nTurning to the audience and raising his voice, Irvin continued: \u201cWe needed to get Amari Cooper, and I think tonight, right here in Dallas, we see the dawn of a new day. The beginning of a new age, and a time when the Cowboys will rightfully regain and take their proper spot among kings!\u201d\n\nAt this point, Irvin was standing and shouting, while being wiped down by a production assistant. \u201cDo you hear me?!\" he exclaimed. \u201cRegain and take their proper spot among the kings!!\u201d\n\nMichael Irvin is fired up! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25 \u201cTonight right here in Dallas, we see the dawn of a new day.

So what happened to that philosophy?\n\n\u201cY\u2019all won two playoff games in 25 years, and you\u2019re going to sit up here, sticking out your chest, and talk about, \u2018It\u2019s the dawn of a new day\u2019?!\u201d Smith shouted. To vigorous boos, he added, \u201cY\u2019all ain\u2019t nothing.

You should be ashamed of yourself!\u201d Smith pointed to the crowd and yelled, \u201cYou should be ashamed of yourselves!\u201d\n\nIrvin, forehead glistening like Patrick Ewing in the fourth quarter of a playoff game against the Heat, countered that the youth of Cooper, Prescott and running back Ezekiel Elliott meant that the Cowboys had \u201c10 good years\u201d ahead of them, repeating the phrase, \u201cDawn of a new day.\u201d\n\nWith Kellerman continuing to question Prescott\u2019s ability to be a top quarterback, Irvin went back to frenzied mode, claiming that the third-year player \u201cput up the greatest rookie season ever! Ever!\u201d He added: \u201cDak Prescott is a big-time player!\u201d\n\nFinally, Irvin took note of what ESPN\u2019s audience could see for some time, saying, \u201cI\u2019m sweating now. Why am I sweating? Is it that hot in here?\u201d\n\nTo chants of \u201cMi-chael! Mi-chael!\u201d he shouted, \u201cI have taken over his show! 'Cause this is my city!\u201d\n\nKellerman then brought up Cowboys Coach Jason Garrett, who has a 70-57 record in eight-plus years in Dallas, with two playoff appearances. \u201cIs that a great coach?\u201d Kellerman asked.\n\nIt was perhaps telling that the subject of the much-maligned coach elicited a far calmer response from Irvin. He said that Garrett \u201cknows how to work with this group of guys,\u201d adding, \u201cRight now he has the young talent, and tonight is the beginning of that.\u201d\n\nRead more from The Post:\n\nFarewell Miami, hello Pittsburgh?

Sunshine Hillygus, a professor at Duke University who studies survey methodology, repeatedly pointed to the Census Bureau\u2019s own research to demonstrate that asking about an individual\u2019s citizenship status would discourage participation among noncitizens and Latinos.\n\nHillygus cited the bureau\u2019s research predicting that between about 5 and 12 percent of noncitizen households would decline to participate, based on the bureau\u2019s analysis of the 2010 Census and long-form survey. She said the estimate was \u201cconservative.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Census Bureau completely agrees the addition of the citizenship question . . . is going to reduce the accuracy of the data,\u201d said Hillygus, a former member of the Census Scientific Advisory Committee, which advises the Census Bureau on statistical data collection.\n\nThe debate over whether the question should be included in the constitutionally mandated decennial head count unfolded Monday at a federal court as the first of three trials opened on the issue. Dozens of states, cities and other groups have sued the administration, calling the question politically motivated and arguing it will depress participation in a process that helps determine apportionment of political power and federal funding.\n\nWhen Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross announced the addition of the question in the spring, he told members of Congress it was in response to a request from the Justice Department to better enforce the Voting Rights Act.\n\nBut after six lawsuits were filed challenging the question, documents released by the government showed Ross had pushed for the question more actively and much earlier than he told Congress.\n\nPlaintiffs in the New York lawsuit had asked for Ross to be questioned in the case. The Supreme Court last month temporarily blocked his deposition, but on Friday it denied the government\u2019s request to delay the trial until a final ruling is reached.\n\nThe suits, which are being tried in New York, Maryland and California, are up against a deadline next summer, when the bureau is set to print the surveys. The case is likely to go to the Supreme Court.\n\n[How Democrats would work to kill census citizenship question if they win the midterms]\n\nSix former census directors and a Census Bureau internal analyst have said a citizenship question would harm the count. That analyst, John Aboud, was in the courtroom Monday, seated with Justice Department attorneys. He is expected to be the government\u2019s sole witness.\n\nOn the witness stand, Hillygus referred to a recent Pew report showing that a majority of Latinos worry that they, a family member or a close friend could be deported. She also pointed to other research showing that the Trump administration\u2019s crackdown on illegal immigration has led some immigrants to opt out of social programs such as food stamps, even if they are eligible.\n\nHillygus said the Census Bureau\u2019s in-person follow-up process would do little to make up for an undercount.\n\nShe also said a memo in which Ross outlined his reasoning was mostly contradicted by what is known about survey science.\n\n\u201cThe Census itself thinks it\u2019s a bad idea, that\u2019s what\u2019s crazy about this,\u201d she told The Washington Post. \u201cEveryone except for Secretary Ross.\u201d\n\nA Commerce Department spokesman said: \u201cSecretary Ross determined that reinstating the citizenship question on the decennial census and directing the Census Bureau to determine the best means to compare responses with administrative records will provide DOJ with the most complete and accurate voting age population by citizenship and race (CVAP) data in response to their request. Asking the citizenship question of 100 percent of the population gives each respondent the opportunity to provide an answer.\u201d\n\nNew York Attorney General Barbara Underwood, who is leading the suit in New York, said that although Ross \u201cobviously is the best source of what his real reason was . . . we have enough evidence here without his testimony.\u201d\n\nImmigrant rights groups held a rally outside the Manhattan courthouse, saying the citizenship question was part of a larger campaign by President Trump and others to exclude immigrants from the political process.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s bigotry is baked into this ridiculous citizenship question,\u201d said Steven Choi, executive director of the New York Immigration Coalition, which is among the plaintiffs in the suit. \u201cIt\u2019s an obvious attempt to subvert the Constitution in order to deprive big, immigrant-rich states of federal dollars and political capital.\u201d\n\nThe trial, before U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman, is expected to continue for two weeks.", "Columnist\n\nI have often said when asked for predictions this year that I turned in my Prognosticator\u2019s Union membership card at 11:45 p.m. on Election Night 2016.\n\nThose who don\u2019t like the labor movement (for which I have a long-standing fondness) shouldn\u2019t worry: There is no prognosticator\u2019s union. The idea was that all pundits should display a degree of humility after President Trump\u2019s victory, which few of us expected.\n\nBut as a friend of mine once observed, you can\u2019t chase the bookie from the track. So I am taking back my old union card and predicting flatly that the Democrats will be doing very well when the returns start rolling in on Tuesday night.\n\nIn House races, a 30-to-35-seat Democratic pickup is reasonable and may not even be the upper limit.\n\nThe Dems will grab a bushel of governor\u2019s races, which I grant you is a vague prediction, but it\u2019s intended to convey a very good night. To be more specific, at least three out of the four key blue-collar Trump states (Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin) will go Democratic. I strongly suspect that Andrew Gillum will win Florida and Stacey Abrams will come in first in Georgia, though I don\u2019t know if she will be able to avoid a runoff.\n\nAnd while the Senate remains a long shot for the Democrats, their chances of the inside straight they need to take the majority are not as distant as many think.\n\nNow why would someone want to go out on a limb like this when there is no need to? I have four reasons.\n\nThe first is the inspiration of Yogi Berra, famous for his unusual and often hilarious verbal formulations. \u201cWe made too many wrong mistakes,\u201d he said (or is said to have said) about the New York Yankees\u2019 1960 World Series loss to the Pittsburgh Pirates. I have pondered this line for years because I actually think that some mistakes don\u2019t turn out to be so wrong after all, while others really are fatal. In the case of this year\u2019s election, I think pundits are making the wrong mistake by being so worried about the mistake we made two years ago.\n\nIt\u2019s true that almost no one (including, it would appear, the victorious candidate himself) expected Trump to pull off the narrow victories in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania that would give him his electoral college majority. Therefore, there is a habit this year to bend over backward to assume that Trump has some kind of magic, that Trump voters always come out of the woodwork on his behalf in key places, and that Democrats can never shoot straight.\n\nThis, I believe, is the \u201cwrong mistake\u201d of 2018. Yes, gerrymandering may hold down Democratic gains and make a lot of races close. But virtually all of the evidence we have from the elections that have been held since Trump\u2019s victory \u2014 the special elections and regularly scheduled state and local contests in 2017 \u2014 is of a rather hard swing away from the Republicans. Mobilization on the Democratic side has been far greater than among Republicans, and primary turnouts, with only a few exceptions, have favored the Democrats.\n\nDemocratic campaigns have been blessed with a volunteer force the size of which is unlike anything that has been seen since Barack Obama\u2019s first race in 2008. And strong disapprovers of Trump have consistently outnumbered strong approvers by large margins \u2014 43 percent to 28 percent in the pre-election Washington Post/ABC News poll, for example. This is another sign of intensity on the Democratic side.\n\nSecond, I believe Trump\u2019s closing \u201cargument,\u201d focused on the \u201ccaravan\u201d and his outlandish (and, to put it mildly, racially tinged) fearmongering, has hurt Republicans in the past week. Yes, it just might help a bit in a couple of Senate races in very pro-Trump states, but I am not even sure of that. What I know is that this is the last thing that will help Republicans among swing voters, moderates and especially women in the House races that are taking place on terrain less friendly to Trump.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that Trump\u2019s approach will increase Republican turnout in very conservative districts that Republicans were already going to win, but this is useless when it comes to holding onto the House. In the swing districts, moderate voters have been reminded of what they really can\u2019t stand about Trump while liberals have been given another reason, if they needed one, to turn out to vote.\n\nThird, when careful analysts such as Charlie Cook have changed their ratings on races over the past week or so, most of the movement has been in the Democrats\u2019 direction. No, please don\u2019t implicate Charlie in my overall analysis here; I\u2019m using his numbers for my own purposes, and I certainly won\u2019t blame him if I\u2019m wrong. But he wouldn\u2019t be moving those races, if he weren\u2019t seeing something like what I am seeing.\n\nAmy Walter, the brilliant national editor of the Cook Political Report, got at what I\u2019m arguing in a clever tweet on Monday:\n\nIn 2016 we spent too much time on the 85% odds of a Hillary win and not enough on the 15% Trump chance. Now, we\u2019re spending too much time on 15% odds of R control of House and the 85% odds of R control of Senate. \u2014 amy walter (@amyewalter) November 5, 2018\n\nThat\u2019s her data-rich way of saying: We\u2019re making the wrong mistake.\n\nAnd the last reason I offer this prediction is personal. I have never believed we are Donald Trump\u2019s country, and I do not believe we ever will be.\n\nMy analysis of the 2016 exit poll data, based on the voters who disliked both Trump and Clinton, is that about 8 or 9 percent of Trump\u2019s 46 percent was far more anti-Clinton than pro-Trump. So he starts with a base of, at best, 35 percent, and he has done nothing to add to it.\n\nExcept for a couple of outlier polls, Trump has never enjoyed anything like majority support. I also believe that many of the blue-collar voters who backed Trump in protest did not fully buy into what he said and do not have a lot to show for his presidency. That\u2019s what the swing against his party in the Midwest will be about.\n\nI think that there are a lot of African American voters who want to stand up for their rights and enough white voters who want to speak up loudly against racism to give Gillum and Abrams a chance \u2014 especially since both of these candidates are (contra Trump) highly qualified and have done a very good job at both mobilization and persuasion.\n\nIf my predictions here are broadly wrong, I will have egg on my face and I\u2019ll turn in that notional union card again, perhaps permanently. But this would not bother me nearly as much as being wrong in my analysis of who we are as Americans. In the end, I am predicting that we will turn our backs on Trumpism because I think that as a people, we really are much better than he thinks we are.\n\nRead more:\n\nWhat can we expect from the midterms?

(Leah Millis/Reuters)\n\nPresident Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Monday issued strong warnings about the threat of voter fraud in Tuesday\u2019s elections, echoing the president\u2019s baseless claims that massive voter fraud marred his 2016 election and prompting accusations that his administration is trying to intimidate voters.\n\nIn a tweet early Monday, Trump said that law enforcement has been \u201cstrongly notified\u201d to watch for \u201cILLEGAL VOTING.\u201d He promised that anyone caught voting improperly would be subjected to \u201cMaximum Criminal Penalties.\u201d Sessions, in a statement laying out the Justice Department\u2019s plans to monitor ballot access on Election Day, said \u201cfraud in the voting process will not be tolerated. Fraud also corrupts the integrity of the ballot.\u201d\n\nIn remarks to reporters on his way to a campaign rally in Cleveland, Trump also falsely claimed that voter fraud is commonplace.\n\n\u201cJust take a look,\u201d he said. \u201cAll you have to do is go around, take a look at what\u2019s happened over the years, and you\u2019ll see. There are a lot of people \u2014 a lot of people \u2014 my opinion, and based on proof \u2014 that try and get in illegally and actually vote illegally. So we just want to let them know that there will be prosecutions at the highest level.\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence of widespread voter fraud in the United States. Trump formed a commission to study the issue shortly after he took office that was disbanded without finding evidence of fraud after states refused to turn over voter data.\n\nVoting rights advocates denounced Trump\u2019s remarks as a blatant attempt to intimidate voters on the eve of Election Day \u2014 and part of a pattern among Republicans, they said, to curtail voting access with strict rules that disproportionately affect voters of color who tend to vote Democratic.\n\n\u201cI find this kind of conduct incredibly anti-patriotic,\u201d said Kristen Clarke, who leads the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, a voting rights group that has successfully challenged several new voting restrictions across the country this year. \u201cAt a time when we need our White House and Justice Department speaking out against the relentless campaign of voter suppression in this election cycle, it defies reason.\u201d\n\nAccusations of voter fraud and voter suppression have roared to the forefront in several closely contested races this year, raising the possibility of recounts and disputed results among dozens of races for House, Senate and governor.\n\nAnticipating possible problems at the polls, political parties, interest groups and voting rights organizations have organized \u201cwar rooms\u201d to watch Tuesday\u2019s elections unfold and recruited thousands of volunteer lawyers to monitor precincts across the country. In his statement, Sessions said the Justice Department will follow its usual protocol of sending monitors across the country to protect against voter suppression, intimidation and discrimination; this year, staff will travel to 35 jurisdictions in 19 states to monitor compliance with voting laws.\n\nIn past years, Justice Department officials have not listed voter fraud as a top concern when announcing the deployment of election monitors, as Sessions did Monday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s indicative of a pattern with this administration,\u201d said David Vance, a spokesman for Common Cause, a civil rights group that helped recruit 6,500 volunteers to monitor polling locations across the country Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s an effort to intimidate voters and keep them away from the polls and try to dictate which voters will turn out and which voters won\u2019t. It flies in the face of what the DOJ has done traditionally to protect voters.\u201d\n\nHomeland Security officials also urged vigilance about a different kind of threat to election security: interference by foreign actors, particularly Russia. They \u201ccontinue to try to influence public sentiment and voter perceptions through actions intended to sow discord,\u201d such as spreading disinformation on social media, officials said in a statement.\n\nNowhere has the debate over voting rights been more acrimonious than in Georgia, where Republican Brian Kemp, a champion of voting restrictions, is running for governor against Democrat Stacey Abrams, who would be the first-ever black female governor in the nation.\n\nKemp, who as secretary of state is also in charge of running Tuesday\u2019s elections, over the weekend accused the state Democratic Party of trying to hack into the state election system. Emails from the party, however, show that party officials were alerted to a possible vulnerability in the state system and forwarded the tip to cybersecurity officials, who in turn forwarded it to lawyers for Kemp as well as the FBI.\n\nOn Monday, computer experts and lawyers involved with the episode said they were stunned that Kemp had turned an effort to alert his office about a security vulnerability into a political attack. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious to me that they\u2019re shooting the messenger,\u201d said Logan Lamb, an Atlanta-based cybersecurity researcher who reviewed the emails over the weekend.\n\nA spokeswoman for Kemp said Monday that his office has referred the matter to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation.\n\nKemp has battled Abrams over voting issues for years. In 2014, he accused the New Georgia Project, a voter-registration group that Abrams founded to register eligible people of color, of fraud, but his investigation produced no evidence of wrongdoing. This year, he accused Abrams of encouraging undocumented immigrants to vote, a charge she denies. This week he circulated the accusation in an automated telephone recording.\n\nKemp also championed strict new voting rules that were partially blocked in a pair of court rulings in recent weeks. One of the laws, requiring personal information on voter registration applications to exactly match other government records, disproportionately affected people of color.\n\nKemp also tweeted an article Monday from Breitbart, a conservative news outlet that regularly publishes right-wing conspiracy theories, claiming that \u201carmed Black Panthers\u201d support Abrams. The racially charged article featured photographs of black men carrying guns and holding Abrams signs.\n\nAccusations and anxiety surfaced in other corners of the nation, too. A California group called the Voting Rights Task Force recruited volunteers on Twitter on Monday to monitor election returns on county websites every 15 minutes \u201cto make sure vote totals don\u2019t go DOWN and to capture it in screenshots if they do.\u201d\n\nIn the Central Valley of California, Democrat Andrew Janz, who is challenging Rep. Devin Nunes, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, accused local election officials of changing his polling location without notice \u2014 and he urged his Twitter followers to check their polling places before heading out to vote Tuesday.\n\nIt turns out that Janz\u2019s polling location had not been changed but that a state website had given him incorrect information, according to the Fresno Bee.\n\nIn North Dakota, advocates continued to monitor a restrictive voter ID law requiring voters to provide identification displaying a residential address, which they say will make it harder for Native Americans to cast ballots because they are less likely to have the necessary documents.\n\nMeanwhile, voting rights were on the ballot in some places. In North Carolina, voters will decide Tuesday whether to require a photo ID to vote. In Kansas, the fiery secretary of state, Kris Kobach, is in a tough gubernatorial race in which his false claims of rampant voter fraud have become a dominant issue. Several House Democrats have promised that new voter protections, including restoring provisions of the Voting Rights Act struck down by the Supreme Court, will be among their top priorities.\n\nOne bright spot for voting rights advocates has been the boost in turnout among early voters logged across the nation. As of Saturday, the number of people voting early had outpaced that of the 2014 midterm elections in 28 states, according to data compiled by Michael McDonald, a political-science professor at the University of Florida. In two additional states, Texas and Nevada, early voting was on track to surpass the entire vote count four years ago, he said.\n\nSaid Vance, of Common Cause: \u201cTo turn out and make yourself heard is the primary weapon to combat these attempts to suppress the vote.\u201d\n\nDevlin Barrett and Cleve Wootson contributed to this report.", "Sri Lankan Buddhist monks supporting ousted prime minister Ranil Wickremesinghe take part in convention held to appeal president Maithripala Sirisena to convene the parliament and restore democracy in Colombo, Sri Lanka, Tuesday, Nov.6, 2018.

Ohtani is a finalist against two New York Yankees teammates for the AL Rookie of the Year award. The Baseball Writers\u2019 Association of America revealed the finalists for its major awards Monday, Nov. 5, 2018. (Ray Carlin, File/Associated Press)\n\nNEW YORK \u2014 Shohei Ohtani is a finalist for the AL Rookie of the Year award along with two New York Yankees infielders.\n\nThe Baseball Writers\u2019 Association of America revealed the finalists for its major awards Monday night. The winners will be announced next week.\n\nOhtani figures to be in a tight race with Yankees infielders Miguel Andujar and Gleyber Torres after a historic first season with the Los Angeles Angels. The two-way Japanese sensation was 4-2 with a 3.31 ERA as a starting pitcher before an elbow injury forced him off the mound. He finished out the season exclusively as a designated hitter, hitting .285 with 22 home runs and 61 RBIs.\n\nOhtani is the first player ever to hit 15 home runs and strike out 50 batters in a season, and he joined Babe Ruth as the only players ever to hit 15 homers and pitch 50 innings. He had Tommy John surgery after the season and is not expected to pitch in 2019.\n\nAndujar hit 47 doubles, tied for the second-most by a rookie in major league history, while Torres had 24 homers and 77 RBIs as a 21-year-old. They are the first teammates to finish top three in Rookie of the Year voting since Wil Myers and Chris Archer with Tampa Bay in 2013.\n\nThe World Series champion Boston Red Sox might be in line for more hardware. Mookie Betts is a finalist for AL MVP, and Alex Cora is in the final three for AL Manager of the Year in his first season. Betts led the majors with a .346 average and .640 slugging percentage while setting career highs with 32 homers and a 1.078 OPS.\n\nLos Angeles\u2019 Mike Trout and Cleveland\u2019s Jose Ramirez are also finalists for AL MVP. Trout has finished in the top two in AL MVP voting in five of the past six seasons after finishing fourth in 2017. Ramirez was third in the voting last year, when Houston\u2019s Jose Altuve beat out Yankees slugger Aaron Judge.\n\nMilwaukee\u2019s Christian Yelich is the favorite for NL MVP, and Colorado\u2019s Nolan Arenado and Chicago\u2019s Javier Baez also were revealed as top vote-getters. Yelich emerged from a crowded field by hitting .370 with 10 homers and a 1.313 OPS in September while the Brewers topped the Cubs for the NL Central title.\n\nThe Mets\u2019 Jacob deGrom, Washington\u2019s Max Scherzer and Philadelphia\u2019s Aaron Nola are the top three for the NL Cy Young Award, with deGrom favored to win for the first time despite a 10-9 record. Felix Hernandez had 13 victories when he won the 2010 AL Cy Young, the fewest wins ever by a starting pitcher to win the award. Scherzer is a three-time winner, including the past two NL awards.\n\nCorey Kluber has a shot at a second straight AL Cy Young Award and third overall. The Cleveland right-hander is up against Tampa Bay\u2019s Blake Snell and Houston\u2019s Justin Verlander, who won the AL Cy Young and MVP Awards in 2011.\n\nCora is up against Tampa Bay\u2019s Kevin Cash and Oakland\u2019s Bob Melvin. Cash oversaw the Rays\u2019 successful experiment with using relief pitchers as \u201copeners\u201d to begin games, a trend that others \u2014 including Melvin \u2014 adopted later in the season. Melvin led Oakland as it charged back into the AL playoff picture and earned a spot in the wild-card game.\n\nMilwaukee\u2019s Craig Counsell, Colorado\u2019s Bud Black and Atlanta\u2019s Brian Snitker were named NL Manager of the Year candidates, while Atlanta\u2019s Ronald Acuna Jr., Washington\u2019s Juan Soto and Los Angeles\u2019 Walker Buehler are the top three for NL Rookie of the Year.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Trump touted the confirmation of Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh \u2014 decrying those who accused the judge of sexual misconduct and Democrats who voted against him \u2014 and he highlighted rising jobs numbers while bragging about the tax cut bill his administration passed.\n\nBut the president\u2019s speeches \u2014 to packed arenas in Indiana, Ohio and here in Missouri \u2014 were dominated by incendiary language about immigration, untrue attacks on his Democratic foes and apocalyptic-sounding threats designed to drive voters to the polls. White House aides have all but given up on keeping control of the House, and the president\u2019s speeches were meant to shore up challenging Senate races in states where he won overwhelmingly.\n\n\u201cIf you want more caravans, if you want more crime, vote Democrat tomorrow,\u201d Trump told thousands of raucous supporters in Indiana, the second of three stops he made on behalf of Republican candidates on the last day before the polls open Tuesday.\n\nTrump claimed that there is a \u201cDemocrat-led assault on America\u2019s sovereignty\u201d and argued that the \u201cDemocrat agenda will deliver a socialist nightmare.\u201d\n\nHe said, again without offering proof, that his opponents want undocumented immigrants to come to the country so they can vote for Democrats and secure an array of free services, like education and safety net benefits.\n\n\n\nPeople watch as President Trump speaks at a rally in Cleveland. (Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images)\n\n\u201cThey want America to be a giant sanctuary city for drug dealers, predators and bloodthirsty MS-13 killers,\u201d he said, again offering no evidence.\n\nHe frequently brought up the migrant caravan traveling through Mexico; he has sent thousands of troops to stop the shrinking group that is still hundreds of miles from the border. Trump has sought to make illegal immigration a vital part of his midterm pitch, even against the advice of some aides and Hill leadership.\n\nThe president told his supporters that \u201cwe\u2019re building the wall, don\u2019t worry,\u201d while arguing that \u201cbarbed wire looks like it\u2019s going to be very effective, too,\u201d referring to his deployment of troops to the southern border.\n\nBefore leaving Washington for Monday\u2019s spate of rallies, Trump announced in a tweet that \u201cLaw Enforcement has been strongly notified to watch closely for any ILLEGAL VOTING which may take place in Tuesday\u2019s Election (or Early Voting). Anyone caught will be subject to the Maximum Criminal Penalties allowed by law.\u201d\n\nShortly before Trump\u2019s tweet, the Justice Department announced that it would send personnel to 35 jurisdictions in 19 states to \u201cmonitor compliance with voting rights laws\u201d \u2014 prompting suspicion and some alarm from voting rights advocates.\n\nTrump, whose own voter fraud commission was abandoned with little to show for it, did not provide any proof of voting irregularities.\n\n\u201cJust take a look. All you have to do is go around, take a look at what\u2019s happened over the years, and you\u2019ll see,\u201d he told reporters before boarding Air Force One in Washington. \u201cThere are a lot of people, a lot of people \u2014 my opinion, and based on proof \u2014 that try and get in illegally and actually vote illegally. So we just want to let them know that there will be prosecutions at the highest level.\u201d\n\nTrump also defended an immigration-themed ad from his campaign after Facebook and several television networks \u2014 including his favorite, Fox News \u2014 decided not to run it because it was deemed racist.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of ads. And they certainly are effective, based on the numbers that we\u2019re seeing,\u201d the president said, when asked if the ad was \u201ctoo racist.\u201d When told that many found the ad offensive, he retorted: \u201cWell, a lot of things are offensive. Your questions are offensive a lot of times.\u201d\n\nAt times Monday, he personalized his attacks, mocking Sen. Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.) as \u201cSleeping Joe,\u201d who wakes only to take orders from Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), the Senate minority leader. He offered no proof for his caustic insults.\n\nOf Richard Cordray, the Democratic nominee for governor in Ohio and a former director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Trump said that he was \u201ccrushing people, crushing community banks, destroying small business, destroying jobs,\u201d and he mocked Cordray\u2019s close ally, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).\n\nHe invoked a number of Democratic bogeyman-like figures to urge voters to go Republican: \u201cThe legendary Maxine Waters, a real genius,\u201d he said of the black congresswoman from California he often attacks.\n\nTrump said in an interview with Sinclair Broadcast Group on Monday that \u201cI would like to have a much softer tone. I feel to a certain extent I have no choice, but maybe I do.\u201d But he showed little desire to tone down his words on the trail.\n\nHe took an explicitly personal tone in a conference call with more than 200,000 supporters and then later at the rally in Cleveland, telling his backers that he was effectively up for reelection as a way to implore his base to turn out and vote Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIn a certain way, I am on the ballot,\u201d Trump said in the call, organized by his reelection campaign. \u201cWhether we consider it or not, the press is very much considering it a referendum on me and us as a movement.\u201d\n\nHe also signaled that his Cabinet could be poised for a shake-up come Wednesday, noting that \u201cadministrations make changes, usually after midterms, and probably we\u2019ll be right in that category, too.\u201d\n\nThe rallies, loud, raucous affairs, evoked the final days of his 2016 campaign \u2014 packed houses, though no snaking lines outside as Trump claimed. Early in the day, the president said that people once didn\u2019t care about the \u201cboring\u201d midterm elections. \u201cNow it\u2019s like the hottest thing,\u201d he said.\n\nHe brought several White House advisers, including press secretary Sarah Sanders, senior adviser and daughter Ivanka Trump, and counselor Kellyanne Conway, to the stage at two rallies \u2014 an unusual arrangement. Rush Limbaugh offered a lengthy soliloquy to Trump in Missouri.\n\nIn Ohio, Trump told the crowd that he would never call a woman beautiful again because it is now \u201cpolitically incorrect\u201d \u2014 an apparent dig at the #MeToo movement \u2014 while introducing Ivanka Trump to the stage.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to use the word \u2018beautiful\u2019 anymore when you talk about women. It\u2019s politically incorrect,\u201d Trump said. He then asked the men in the crowd to raise their hands and vow to never call women beautiful.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not allowed to say it because \u2014 because it\u2019s my daughter Ivanka, but she\u2019s really smart and she\u2019s here,\u201d Trump continued. \u201cShould I bring her up? . . . Come on up, Ivanka.\u201d\n\n\u201cWow, wow. Hi, Ohio,\u201d Ivanka Trump said. \u201cThat was some introduction.\u201d\n\nAfter she left the microphone, her father said, \u201cI never said she was beautiful, but she was smart.\u201d\n\nThe nexus between the Trump administration and Fox News was on vivid display Monday. At the president\u2019s final rally, Fox hosts Sean Hannity and Jeanine Pirro came onstage. Hannity had said earlier in the day that he wouldn\u2019t be campaigning with Trump but ended up giving him a bear hug onstage after interviewing him offstage.\n\nPirro seemed to get a promotion, with Trump calling her \u201cJustice Jeanine\u201d and bragging about her ratings.\n\nKim reported from Washington.

And not all analysts are playing it safe this year, even after most of them got it wrong in 2016.\n\nAfter pointing to an expected Clinton victory on the eve on the 2016 presidential election, MSNBC\u2019s Nicolle Wallace on Wednesday again suggested poor midterm results for Trump.\n\nTrump \"is going to lose on Tuesday,\u201d Wallace said. \u201cHe said, \u2018This is about me.\u2019 He said, \u2018Vote for me.\u2019 So if anyone he campaigned for loses, it is a giant failure on the part of this president.\u201d", "\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection agents take part in a training exercise at the U.S.-Mexico border on Monday in Hidalgo, Tex.

(John Moore/Getty Images)\n\nThere are no indications that the migrants, most of whom are Honduran and include many women and children, pose a threat that would necessitate long- and short-range tactical engagements. But CBP agents have drilled with armored vehicles, riot gear, helicopters and more, photos from the border have shown.\n\nThe preparations come amid questions about how much force active-duty soldiers and agents along the border can and should use.\n\nPresident Trump had suggested that troops should treat rock-throwers as combatants and that rifle fire would be an appropriate response, but he later backtracked on his comments.\n\nCritics have maintained that surplus military gear diverted from the Pentagon to civilian police \u2014 items ranging from uniforms to sniper rifles to vehicles designed to absorb strikes from improvised explosive devices \u2014 produce an overly aggressive law enforcement posture.\n\nResearchers have found evidence of that. A 2017 study in the journal Research and Politics that focused on four states concluded that there was a relationship between law enforcement that acquired military gear and fatalities from officer-involved shootings.\n\nDemocratic societies have moved to draw stark lines between military and police, said Jason Fritz, a former Army officer and a lecturer at Johns Hopkins University who focuses on the militarization of police.\n\nBut the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq created a high-water mark of billions in available equipment, and subsequent drawdowns from each nation have meant law enforcement entities nationwide have snatched up gear developed for guerrilla warfare and battling conventional armies.\n\n\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection agents take part in a training exercise in Hidalgo, Tex. (John Moore/Getty Images)\n\nThat availability has blurred the line between civilian law enforcement and military units, Fritz said. And there is also a feedback loop with the gear from films, television shows and video games that depict military operations, he told The Washington Post on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIf you put a bunch of gee-whiz stuff on an M4, you go from being a regular cop into a special operator,\u201d Fritz said. \u201cThere\u2019s a psychological effect outward and inward.\u201d\n\nAgents wielding military gear in photos belonged to CBP\u2019s Border Patrol Special Operations Group \u2014 the agency\u2019s premier tactical response team, which includes units focused on medical assistance and saving lives during disasters such as hurricanes.\n\nCBP did not return a request for comment about which unit was shown training on the Texas-Mexico border.\n\nThe Army deployed a large number of photographers to document laying wire to bolster its objective of deterring migrants. Fritz said the CBP training exercise with apparent media access operated in a similar fashion.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty classic show of force for psychological effect,\u201d Fritz said of the CBP operations.\n\nThe appearance of aggression has already led to the cancellation of a CBP drill near El Paso on Tuesday, amid concerns its proximity to a Hispanic neighborhood would suggest voter suppression.\n\nThe Obama administration restricted the Pentagon\u2019s 1033 program, which transferred surplus military equipment to law enforcement agencies, late in his second term after images of officers atop armored vehicles pointing rifles at protesters in Ferguson, Mo., drew severe criticism.\n\nTrump rolled back those restrictions in August 2017.\n\nCBP received nearly $40 million in tactical gear from the Defense Department through 2014, the Marshall Project reported. It is unclear whether tactical gear has been recently acquired from the Pentagon for border operations or whether other equipment has been purchased directly by the Department of Homeland Security.\n\n\n\nA soldier with the 1st Battalion, 10th Special Forces Group, with a weapon load-out similar to what of some Customs and Border Protection agents now have.

(Olivia Acland/Reuters)\n\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield said Monday that the Ebola outbreak in conflict-ridden Congo has become so serious that international public health experts need to consider the possibility that it cannot be brought under control and instead will become entrenched.\n\nIf that happened, it would be the first time since the deadly viral disease was first identified in 1976 that an Ebola outbreak led to the persistent presence of the disease. In all previous outbreaks, most of which took place in remote areas, the disease was contained before it spread widely. The current outbreak is entering its fourth month, with nearly 300 cases, including 186 deaths.\n\nIf Ebola becomes endemic in substantial areas of North Kivu province, in northeastern Congo, \u201cthis will mean that we\u2019ve lost the ability to trace contacts, stop transmission chains and contain the outbreak,\u201d said Tom Inglesby, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, which hosted the briefing on Capitol Hill that featured the Ebola discussion with Redfield.\n\nIn that scenario, there would be a sustained and unpredictable spread of the deadly virus, with major implications for travel and trade, he said, noting that there are 6 million people in North Kivu. By comparison, the entire population of Liberia, one of the hardest-hit countries during the West Africa Ebola epidemic of 2014-2016, is about 4.8 million.\n\nThe outbreak is taking place in a part of Congo that is an active war zone. Dozens of armed militias operate in the area, attacking government outposts and civilians, complicating the work of Ebola response teams and putting their security at risk. Violence has escalated in recent weeks, severely hampering the response. The daily rate of new Ebola cases more than doubled in early October. In addition, there is community resistance and deep mistrust of the government.\n\nSome sick people have refused to go to treatment centers, health-care workers are still being infected, and some people are dying of Ebola or spreading the virus to new areas. An estimated 60 to 80 percent of new confirmed cases have no known epidemiological link to prior cases, making it very difficult for responders to track cases and stop transmission. In late August, the United States withdrew some of the CDC\u2019s most seasoned Ebola experts who had been stationed in Beni, the province\u2019s urban epicenter, because of security risks.\n\n\u201cI do think this is one of the challenges we\u2019ll have to see, whether we\u2019re able to contain, control and end the current outbreak with the current security situation, or do we move into the idea that this becomes more of an endemic Ebola outbreak in this region, which we\u2019ve never really confronted,\u201d Redfield said.\n\nIf that happens, health-care responders may need to consider vaccinating broader populations instead of the current strategy of vaccinating those who have been in contact with infected people.\n\nWhen contact tracing begins to fall apart, \u201cthen you are entering another phase and losing the hope that you can arrest the outbreak through standard interventions,\u201d J. Stephen Morrison, senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said in an interview. In a new report, Morrison wrote that there is an urgent need for \u201chigh-level political attention focused on generating an updated game plan\u201d to improve security, train and deploy community health workers, and win community trust.\n\n\u201cThis is going to be a complicated and deeply problematic situation and we need to prepare ourselves for dealing with this long term,\u201d Morrison said.\n\nRedfield, officials from the World Health Organization and other experts say one of the biggest worries is the spread within Congo to places like Butembo, a major trading port and urban area, where the risk of widespread transmission escalates dramatically.\n\nIn mid-October, the World Health Organization said that it was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d by the outbreak but that the situation did not yet warrant being declared a global emergency. The U.N. health agency called for response activities to be \u201cintensified.\u201d The WHO\u2019s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, and a top U.N. official for peacekeeping operations, are in Congo this week to take stock of the response.\n\nRead more:\n\nDrop in adult flu vaccinations may be factor in last season\u2019s record-breaking deaths, illnesses\n\nParalyzing polio-like illness mainly affecting children confirmed in 22 states, CDC says\n\nHow Ebola sped out of control", "Opinion writer\n\n* Ashley Parker, Josh Dawsey, and Philip Rucker report that things are going to change in the administration after the midterms:\n\nThe Trump administration is bracing for a massive staff shake-up in the weeks following the midterm elections, as the fates of a number of Cabinet secretaries and top White House aides are increasingly uncertain heading into a potentially perilous time for President Trump. Some embattled officials, including Attorney General Jeff Sessions, are expected to be fired or actively pushed out by Trump after months of bitter recriminations. Others, notably Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, may leave amid a mutual recognition that their relationship with the president has become too strained. And more still plan to take top roles on Trump\u2019s 2020 reelection campaign or seek lucrative jobs in the private sector after nearly two years in government. The expected midterm exodus would bring fresh uncertainty and churn to a White House already plagued by high turnover and internal chaos. Many in Trump\u2019s orbit worry that the administration will face challenges filling the vacancies \u2014 especially if Democrats win the House majority and use their oversight powers to investigate the administration and issue subpoenas to top officials.\n\nWell, it\u2019s such a smooth-running machine that I\u2019m sure everything will work out just fine.\n\n* Jeff Zeleny reports that President Trump wasn\u2019t pleased with the soft-focus ad his campaign put out about how great everything is supposedly going:\n\nPresident Donald Trump was not pleased by the marquee closing TV ad his campaign unveiled last week featuring upbeat themes about the economy. \u201cHe hated it,\u201d one Republican official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss internal conversations the President had with allies. Instead, he insisted to aides that his closing argument for the midterm elections would be a hardline anti-immigration message to fire up his core supporters, two Republican officials familiar with the matter tell CNN. House Republican sources who had been frustrated with the President for a number of reasons this election year very much liked the ad touting the economy because it was a rare appeal to the very suburban female voter they are worried about losing big time \u2014 largely because of the President\u2019s polarizing rhetoric.\n\nWhat he actually hated, I\u2019m sure, was that the original ad didn\u2019t feature him.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) do not represent the average incoming Democrat in the House.\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of Democrats who will constitute the majority-makers \u2014 that is, the people who will hand control to Democrats \u2014 are very mainstream,\u201d said Matt Bennett, co-founder and senior vice president for public affairs at Third Way, a center-left think tank in Washington. \u201cThe story line that the party has moved left and all the energy is coming from the far left is just not true.\u201d\n\nBennett pointed to messaging on Medicare-for-all, a major priority for Sanders and his ideological compatriots on the left. He said that in the 86 most competitive House races, no Democrats have been pushing the issue in general-election ads. Democrats have more often talked about the goal of health-care coverage for all, leaving the details for the next Congress \u2014 and the party\u2019s voters have been similarly pragmatic.\n\n\n\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York is running for a House seat. (Andrew Kelly/Reuters)\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t confuse anti-Trump energy, which is real, deep and profound, with a demand for Democrats to stand for the things that Bernie Sanders talks about,\u201d he said. \u201cThis year, the most pivotal voters are interested in holding Trump accountable for the horror of his presidency, not electing people who will offer pie-in-the-sky ideas.\u201d\n\nRep. Cheri Bustos (D-Ill.), the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee\u2019s chair of Heartland Engagement, has argued that Democratic victories in red areas will come from emphasizing more typical and nearly universal priorities such as protecting Medicare and Social Security.\n\n\u201cWe are talking about this in every single one of these races,\u201d Bustos said in late October on MSNBC. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s not coming from Washington, D.C. constantly, but it is here in Peoria, Illinois, it is in Dubuque, Iowa, it is in Kentucky, it is in southern Illinois. It\u2019s all over the place. We are talking about it loudly and clearly.\u201d\n\nThat would be in keeping with past Democratic majorities, such as the 2006 version made possible when moderates joined liberals to upend Republican control of the House in an election that centered on broad national opposition to the Iraq War.\n\nDemocrats need a net gain of 23 seats on Tuesday to win control of the House. Forecasters have been cautiously optimistic that Democrats will meet this mark, though it is unclear how big their new majority could be.\n\nKondik argued that while many Democrats likely to claim seats on Tuesday are to the right of Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez, they are still a \u201ctick or two\u201d to the left of the more socially conservative Blue Dog Democrats of decades past.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a culturally conservative group of candidates, in part because the districts are not culturally conservative districts. These are affluent, highly educated suburban seats,\u201d he said.\n\nIt is already clear that a number of women and people of color will join the Democratic caucus, given the profile of Democratic nominees in safe Democratic seats and those most likely to flip this year.\n\nThese candidates include the three mentioned earlier: State Sen. Sylvia Garcia of Texas is expected to replace retiring Democratic Rep. Gene Green; Joe Neguse of Colorado is expected to replace outgoing Democratic Rep. Jared Polis, who is running for governor; and Chrissy Houlahan is expected to replace retiring Rep. Ryan Costello, a Republican.\n\nPennsylvania, where three female Democrats have a good chance of winning Republican seats, has become a test case for women\u2019s performance in an election cycle where their participation as candidates has broken records. The state has never had more than two women at a time in its congressional delegation.\n\nThe Raben Group, a public affairs and lobbying firm, analyzed the field of House candidates and found that if Democrats keep their current seats and win about 40 more, women will hold one in four seats and people of color will jump to 27 percent. Currently, one in five House seats is held by a woman and 23 percent are held by people of color, the analysis said.\n\nKelly Dittmar, an assistant professor of political science at Rutgers University-Camden, described this as the \u201cideal scenario\u201d and predicted that women will take a record number of House seats. But she said the story will be \u201cfar less celebratory\u201d for Republican women.\n\nIn Florida, where the retirement of longtime Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R), the first Latina elected to Congress, has opened the door to possible victory by former Clinton Cabinet secretary Donna Shalala, a Democrat. Shalala\u2019s Republican opponent is Maria Elvira Salazar, a broadcast journalist of Cuban heritage, but she is not favored to win.\n\nAnd in Utah, Rep. Mia Love, the sole black Republican woman in Congress, is defending her Salt Lake County seat against Democrat Ben McAdams.\n\n\u201cThere is a note of caution we\u2019re raising even with the gains for women that we will see,\u201d said Dittmar, a scholar at the Center for American Women and Politics and the Eagleton Institute of Politics. \u201cAnd that is that Republican women are likely to see a decline in their numbers in the House.\u201d\n\nHouse Republicans could gain one Asian American woman if Young Kim, a former state legislator, wins in Southern California\u2019s open 39th Congressional District. Kim is running against Democrat Gil Cisneros, who is Latino.\n\nWomen and people of color will exert serious influence over policy if Democrats claim a majority in the House.\n\nThe Raben Group found that if Democrats take the House, women would be in line to lead four committees, people of color to lead eight and an openly LGBT lawmaker to lead one.\n\nThis would be a marked change from the current Republican-led House, where all but two committees are chaired by men and none is led by a person of color.\n\nIn several firsts, Democrats Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rashia Tlaib of Michigan are poised to become the first Muslim women in Congress. And according to Dittmar, states that could elect their first women of color to Congress include Connecticut, Minnesota, Massachusetts and Kansas.\n\nShe struck another note of caution.\n\n\u201cWe want to celebrate these moments, but if that\u2019s the first, we\u2019re clearly not at the point of parity or full representation. . . . But we also want to make sure that people don\u2019t check it off the list like we achieved full parity this year,\u201d she said.\n\nRead more at PowerPost", "\n\nCentral American migrants pack into the back of a trailer truck as they begin their morning trek as part of a thousands-strong caravan hoping to reach the U.S. border, in Isla, Veracruz state, Mexico, on Nov. 4. (Marco Ugarte/AP)\n\nMedia critic\n\nSome U.S. broadcasters require several days to determine that a facially racist piece of video is racist. That\u2019s the lesson to be drawn from the most compelling pre-midterm media story in the United States.\n\nAs this blog noted way back on Nov. 1, President Trump on Halloween tweeted out a campaign video on immigration. Some news outlets called it \u201ccontroversial\u201d or \u201cracially charged.\u201d In fact, it was something more simple. \u201cTrump shocks with racist new ad days before midterms,\u201d noted CNN in its news coverage of the ad.\n\nTurns out that the ad people at CNN concurred. Donald Trump Jr. complained in a tweet that the network had refused to run the ad:\n\nCNN refused to run this ad... I guess they only run fake news and won\u2019t talk about real threats that don\u2019t suit their agenda. Enjoy. Remember this on Tuesday. #vote #voterepublican pic.twitter.com/VyMm7GhPLX \u2014 Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) November 3, 2018\n\nCNN\u2019s PR Twitter feed responded:\n\nCNN has made it abundantly clear in its editorial coverage that this ad is racist. When presented with an opportunity to be paid to take a version of this ad, we declined. Those are the facts. \ud83c\udf4e \u2014 CNN Communications (@CNNPR) November 3, 2018\n\nCNN \u2014 both on the editorial and ad side \u2014 was correct. The ad juxtaposes the crazed statements of an undocumented immigrant convicted of police killings against images of thousands of caravaners coming north through Mexico. \u201cWHO ELSE WOULD DEMOCRATS LET IN?\u201d asks a banner in the ad. The message: Those hordes of brown people from Central America \u2014 they\u2019re killers. Be afraid of them.\n\nWhy was CNN uniquely able to discern this very obvious message? After profiting from its airing, two major players in U.S. media are bailing on the ad. NBC played the ad during Sunday night\u2019s football game between the New England Patriots and the Green Bay Packers, a decision that prompted outcries against the network.\n\n\u201cAfter further review, we recognize the insensitive nature of the ad and have decided to cease airing it across our properties as soon as possible,\u201d said a statement from the network. Fox News issued its own, similar statement: \u201cUpon further review, Fox News pulled the ad yesterday and it will not appear on either Fox News Channel or Fox Business Network,\u201d Fox\u2019s ad sales president Marianne Gambelli told CNN. Facebook\u2019s about-face came with this statement: \u201cThis ad violates Facebook\u2019s advertising policy against sensational content so we are rejecting it. While the video is allowed to be posted on Facebook, it cannot receive paid distribution.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s tempting to credit these organizations for reaching the right decision. But such temptation should be resisted here. The flow of the ad itself \u2014 knitting together the horror of murder with images of Central American migrants \u2014 leaves little room for interpretation. It\u2019s prima facie racism \u2014 worse, even, than the famous \u201cWillie Horton\u201d ad from George H.W. Bush\u2019s presidential run in 1988. On this front, CNN continues to speak with clarity: \u201cFacebook has stopped the Trump campaign from running its racist anti-immigration commercial as an ad on the site,\u201d reads the lead sentence in its story on the social media giant\u2019s approach to the backlash.\n\nAnother consideration is timing. When the Trump people launched the ad, the clear intent was to reach folks on the weekend before the midterms. These organizations assisted in that effort. NBC\u2019s audience for the \u201cSunday Night Football\u201d clash between two top National Football League teams fetched a generous 21 million viewers. The ad aired as well on MSNBC.\n\nSo these pullbacks come a bit late.\n\nAs the Daily Beast\u2019s Maxwell Tani wrote last week, CNN did provide extensive editorial coverage of the ad, paired with appropriate denunciations of its content.\n\nThe aggressive racism in the ad places editors in a lose-lose-lose-lose-lose position. Ignore the ad, and leave the American public in the dark about the hateful things the president is doing in service of his political agenda. Cover the ad, and risk providing \u201cearned media\u201d to the president\u2019s message. The only feasible approach is to cover it while citing the racism at its core.\n\nTake a close look at the statements from the organizations that have now rejected the ad. NBC cited the ad\u2019s \u201cinsensitive nature\u201d; Facebook cited \u201csensational content,\u201d as befits a tech titan; Fox News didn\u2019t characterize the ad. As with all corporate statements, these examples are carefully lawyered, carefully PR\u2019d. The companies aren\u2019t calling the ad \u201cracist,\u201d even as they bail on it.\n\nTo do so would be to admit that they\u2019ve profited from racism. Far preferable to profit from \u201csensational content.\u201d", "\n\nD.C. at night.

If it\u2019s not raining as you head out, voting in the morning might not be the worst idea, but it shouldn\u2019t be too bad later in the day, either.\n\nListen to our daily D.C. forecasts: Apple Podcasts | Amazon Echo | More options\n\nThrough Tonight: Not much change into the evening, except for too much darkness. Our air mass is a bit stagnated until after sunrise tomorrow, so low clouds and fog remain, as does at least periodic drizzle. Temperatures don\u2019t go too far from where they were this afternoon, with lows mainly in the mid-40s to lower 50s.\n\nView the current weather at The Washington Post.\n\nElection Day (Tuesday): We\u2019ve still got low clouds, fog and drizzle around early. Perhaps a few showers, as well. Nothing too intense, but it keeps things damp. The driest time of the day may be from the post-sunrise period into about midday. At that point, the front is coming in with more showers and perhaps a stronger storm or two that contains damaging winds and/or a tornado. Pretty similar to Friday night\u2019s setup, although it arguably overperformed. Once the first line moves through, showers remain a risk through sunset or a bit longer, although it should be doable to get out and vote as needed! Highs should make the mid-60s to perhaps around 70 before the afternoon rain moves in.\n\nSee Jason Samenow\u2019s forecast through the weekend.

They have watched some of the state\u2019s wealthiest people \u2014 including billionaire financier Ben Navarro \u2014 form a coalition this year to back school board candidates who support a broad expansion of charter schools.\n\nThe Charleston Coalition for Kids has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in advertising as 11 candidates vie for four seats on the Charleston County School District Board of Trustees. The coalition, which is run by a former Teach For America executive in charge of recruiting educators in the state, has won big endorsements in town, including from former mayors and school board members.\n\nAnd it has links to Michelle Rhee, the controversial former D.C. schools chancellor and pioneer in the school \u201creform\u201d movement that sought to use standardized test scores to evaluate teachers, principals and students and pushed for alternatives to publicly governed school districts.\n\nCoalition leaders say they simply want to improve education in the city. But some residents \u2014 including pastors, former and current school board members and parents \u2014 say the group\u2019s real aim it to expand charter schools, which are publicly funded but privately operated. Those residents say that will harm the 50,000-student school system.\n\n\u201cThough Charleston Coalition for Kids claims to seek to disrupt the status quo, its record suggests it aims to continue experiments in privatization that continue to fail those who need quality public education the most,\u201d said Allison Mackey of the nonprofit Quality Education Project.\n\nWhat\u2019s happening in Charleston is mirrored in cities, counties and states across the country: The super-wealthy are using their influence and money to elect candidates in education races who support the movement to find alternatives to publicly funded and governed school districts.\n\nWhy are billionaires involved in local and state school board races in states where they live \u2014 and often don\u2019t? This is how education advocates Diane Ravitch and Carol Burris explained it in this piece:\n\nThe objective could not be clearer \u2014 influence districts to expand their charter sector until eventually all, or nearly all, schools are privately operated and managed. Those district offices that remain could be filled not by educational leaders but by managers and technicians hired to ensure that buses run on time, schools are opened, closed or transferred to other operators, enrollment is managed, and funding is distributed. Public voice is stifled. Schools become publicly funded businesses.\n\nIn California, the faceoff between two Democrats vying for the nonpartisan position of superintendent of public instruction (which, incidentally, has no policymaking power) has attracted tens of millions of dollars, much of it going to Marshall Tuck, the candidate who supports expanding charter schools. Much of his money comes from billionaires who support charter schools. Many live out of state, including Michael R. Bloomberg of New York and Alice Walton of Texas. Other donors include Netflix chief executive Reed Hastings and Gap founder Doris Fisher.\n\nIn Arizona, the billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch sought to block a group called Save Our Schools from placing Proposition 305 on the ballot. It would allow voters a chance to decide whether the state\u2019s program that uses tax dollars for private and religious school education should be expanded to all students. Americans for Prosperity, the political arm of the Kochs, sued to block the referendum from being put on a ballot. The Koch brothers failed. So why would champions of the \u201creform\u201d movement block this referendum? They\u2019re afraid voters will reject the use of public money in this way.\n\nMeanwhile, Americans for Prosperity Wisconsin recently spent about $1.8 million for an ad campaign to boost Gov. Scott Walker (R) in his reelection fight against Democrat Tony Evers, the state\u2019s schools superintendent. Walker has a reputation in his state for being hostile to traditional public schools.\n\nAnd there\u2019s Leadership for Educational Equity, a spinoff of Teach For America, the controversial nonprofit that has for years placed mostly recent college graduates into needy schools. The spinoff has two board members from billionaire families \u2014 the Bloombergs and the Waltons \u2014 and through its Leaders in Education Fund, it is spending money on school board races around the country for candidates who favor school choice.\n\nIn the District, more than $225,000 has been poured into races for four seats on the D.C. State Board of Education, which has virtually no policymaking power. Much of the money has come from outside the city and is being spent on candidates who support charter schools and other elements of corporate school overhauls.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, nearly $530,000 has been donated since January to the D.C. chapter of Democrats for Education Reform (DFER), which advocates charter schools and donates to candidates who support those schools and who back some anti-union policies ordinarily associated with Republicans. And DFER, which has billionaire donors \u2014 Rupert Murdoch once donated $1 million to an arm of the group called Education Reform Now \u2014 has backed some pro-charter candidates, as Washington Post reporter Perry Stein reported here:\n\nJason Andrean, a finance manager who sits on the board of a charter school, faces Emily Gasoi, a former teacher who sends her daughter to a language immersion charter school. Both candidates have received more than half of their donations from outside the District. But Andrean, who raised nearly $60,000 as of Aug. 10, has drawn more scrutiny because of his ties to the charter world. He received an endorsement from the D.C. chapter of Democrats for Education Reform. ... Andrean resigned from Democrats for Education Reform\u2019s board in January to run for the open seat.\n\nMeanwhile, in Charleston, as the Post and Courier reported, three members of the Charleston Coalition for Kids, including two who appear in a promotional video, \u201care part of Charleston RISE, a group of parent advocates who received training from the pro-charter school organization SouthCarolinaCAN.\u201d The parent group of SouthCarolinaCAN is 50CAN, formerly StudentsFirst South Carolina, whose stated goals include advocating charter schools, school choice and private-school tuition tax-credit programs.\n\nStudentsFirst is the organization started by Rhee after she quit the District chancellor\u2019s job in 2010. Rhee, in fact, has been in Charleston, speaking in February 2017 to a SouthCarolinaCAN event and meeting with Superintendent Gerrita Postlewait several times.\n\nIn an email, Postlewait said she met with Rhee at Rhee\u2019s request about StudentsFirst and other issues in 2016 and then saw her again, but did not meet with her in April 2017 at a gathering of 12 parents who were the \u201cfirst participants\u201d in South Carolina\u2019s StudentsFirst group. She said, \u201cMichelle Rhee is not, and has not, worked with or in any capacity with any initiatives of the Charleston County School District.\u201d\n\nIn September, the Coalition for Kids endorsed the three incumbent school board candidates and Joyce Green, who was appointed in 2016 to the advisory committee for one of the public-private partnership schools, Meeting Street Academy at Brentwood. The school is managed by Navarro, the billionaire. And expensive television ads began running shortly thereafter, along with fancy fliers and mailers.", "President Trump told an Ohio crowd Monday that he would never call a woman beautiful again because it is now \u201cpolitically incorrect.\u201d\n\nThe remarks, part of an introduction of his daughter, Ivanka Trump, seemed a jab at the #MeToo movement.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to use the word \u2018beautiful\u2019 anymore when you talk about women.

He faces a maximum eight-year prison sentence in the May 2017 disappearance of Isabella Hellmann, his wife of just three months. U.S. District Judge Federico Moreno set sentencing for Jan. 10.\n\n\u201cAlthough nothing can ever erase the pain and suffering caused by Lewis Bennett\u2019s criminal acts, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office and our law enforcement partners hope that the defendant\u2019s admission of guilt is a step toward justice for the victim,\u201d U.S. Attorney Ariana Fajardo Orshan said in a statement.\n\nBennett, a mining engineer, had told the FBI and British journalists that he and Hellmann, a South Florida real estate agent, took their 37-foot (11-meter) catamaran, Surf Into Summer, for a Caribbean cruise. They left their infant daughter, Emelia, with her family in Florida.\n\nAs the catamaran passed the Bahamas on the return to Florida, Bennett sent out an emergency radio signal. When the Coast Guard found him on a life raft three hours later, he told rescuers he left Hellmann on deck as he retired for the night to their cabin. He said he was jolted awake when their craft hit something and that Hellmann was gone when he went outside. He said he abandoned the catamaran in a life raft because it was sinking.\n\nA sworn document signed by Bennett and filed in court says that he could not recall whether he called out for his wife. He did not deploy any flares and did not search for Hellmann in the water with either the catamaran or an attached dinghy. Nor did Bennet immediately activate any emergency equipment or call for help using his satellite phone.\n\nIt was not until Bennett boarded the life raft that he called for help and reported his wife missing, about 45 minutes after he was awakened.\n\nProsecutors said Bennett is an experienced sailor who received a certification from the Royal Yachting Association in the United Kingdom as a \u201cCoastal Skipper.\u201d The training included instruction on emergency procedures such as man-overboard protocols and night-sailing safety. His wife was not nearly as experienced.\n\nThe Coast Guard eventually located the boat. The FBI says an inspection of the catamaran before it sank showed portholes below the waterline had been opened and damage to the twin hulls appeared to have been caused from the inside, meaning the boat may have been intentionally scuttled.\n\nAlso investigators found Bennett on the life raft with $100,000 worth of coins stolen from a yacht he had worked aboard in 2016.\n\nBennett pleaded guilty to the coin theft charge and received a seven-month prison sentence. While serving that sentence, he was charged in February with Hellmann\u2019s death and has remained jailed.\n\n___\n\nFollow Curt Anderson on Twitter: http://twitter.com/Miamicurt\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP/AP)\n\nIn the weeks after Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi was killed in Istanbul, Saudi Arabia\u2019s government offered ever-changing explanations for what had happened. It took weeks for Riyadh to admit that Khashoggi was dead and that his countrymen had killed him.\n\nCritics and world leaders say Saudi Arabia still isn\u2019t telling the whole truth, but Khashoggi\u2019s sons have taken a much more measured approach. In a Sunday interview with CNN, Salah and Abdullah Khashoggi said they trusted the Saudi government to bring the perpetrators to justice. It was the first time the brothers had spoken to U.S. media since Jamal Khashoggi, a contributing columnist for The Washington Post, was killed Oct. 2.\n\n\u201cThe king has stressed that everybody involved will be brought to justice. And I have faith in that. This will happen. Otherwise [the Saudi government] wouldn\u2019t have started an internal investigation,\u201d Salah Khashoggi, 35, said on CNN.\n\nWhat explains his measured comment?\n\nExperts say he may be trying to protect himself and his family from government retaliation.

In the days after Jamal Khashoggi disappeared after entering the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, his first wife, Alaa Nassif, told Saudi media outlets that she didn\u2019t know anything about his new fiancee, a Turkish national, and wondered why she was handling his social media.\n\nNassif also expressed faith in the Saudi government.\n\n\u201cAll the Saudi dissidents have not been harmed; no one reached to them to hurt them, even when they are outside the country. This is a truth since the establishment of the country. They might have said more than what Jamal have said, and they were not harmed. There are many examples,\u201d Nassif said in an interview with Al Arabiya English, an outlet run by the Saudi government.\n\nThere may even be divides within the family about who Khashoggi was and how he should be remembered. One indication might be the way the Khashoggi brothers described their father on CNN.\n\nIn the interview, Abdullah Khashoggi called his father a \u201crock-and-roll star as a journalist\u201d and someone who was \u201cpushing the system a bit.\u201d His father, he said, was \u201cbrave.\u201d\n\nSalah Khashoggi offered a different picture, that of a \u201cmoderate man who has common values with everyone.\u201d He was \u201ca man who loved his country and believed very much in it and its potential,\u201d he said. \u201cJamal was never a dissident. \u2026 He believed in the transformation that [Saudi Arabia] was going through.

If you\u2019ve heard anything at all about a governor\u2019s race in a state other than your own, chances are it had to do with vote suppression in Georgia or some, ahem, racially charged controversies in Florida. Both those races feature dynamic young African American Democrats who would make history if they won, but there are lots of other interesting races going on at the same time.\n\nSo let\u2019s break it down. We\u2019ll start with the big-picture predictions being offered today by Larry Sabato and Kyle Kondik of Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball:\n\nRight now, the Republicans hold 33 governorships, the Democrats just 16, and an independent, Bill Walker holds Alaska. Our ratings suggest the Democrats could net 10 governorships, while the GOP could lose nine (we favor Republicans to pick up Alaska, which throws off the net change statistic a little bit). That does not include Georgia, where we are maintaining a unique \u201cToss-up/Leans Runoff\u201d rating in anticipation of a possible runoff on Dec. 4 if neither major party candidate gets a majority. If the runoff happens, just think about how much money former state House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams (D) might raise from the Democrats\u2019 hyper-active small donor network. This is something that concerns Republicans if there\u2019s a runoff. More than half of the Democratic pickups could come in the Midwest. While we think the GOP could claw back one or two of these states \u2014 Iowa, Kansas, and Wisconsin are the picks we\u2019re the least confident in \u2013 we thought the data and the year\u2019s overall trends pointed to the Democrats in each of these states individually. Besides the national environment, there may just be a fatigue with eight years of conservative GOP rule in places like Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin, particularly in a time of conservative governance in Washington. The public is idiosyncratic and often wants what it doesn\u2019t have; the same dynamic helped Trump win many states in the Midwest after eight years of a liberal Democratic president.\n\nThat would be an absolutely earth-shaking shift, from a situation in which Republicans hold twice as many governorships to one in which Democrats hold slightly more than Republicans do.\n\nThe governor\u2019s mansions that Sabato and Kondik predict will flip from Republican to Democrat are Nevada, New Mexico, Kansas, Iowa, Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan, Ohio, Florida and Maine. The only places Republicans have even a shot to win a seat currently held by Democrats are Connecticut and Oregon.\n\nOther forecasters are more conservative than the Crystal Ball folks; for instance, the Cook Political Report rates most of those races as toss-ups, and FiveThirtyEight has a more complex set of ratings that shows most of those races heading in the direction of the Democrat. But it looks likely that Democrats will get big gains at the state level and could even run the table on these races. If the blue wave is as big as it could be, it would tip many of those close races over to the Democrat. Even without that, there are multiple important races \u2014 for instance, in Illinois and Michigan \u2014 where the Democrat is clearly ahead.\n\nIf more of those races fell to the Democratic side, the consequences would be enormous. In the short run, there would be substantial policy changes as many of these states move from unified Republican rule \u2014 under which Republicans went hog-wild passing conservative legislation \u2014 to one where the parties have to work together, or even one where Democrats have complete control. There are also multiple states where one or both chambers of the legislature could flip from red to blue if Democrats have a big night.\n\nThink about a state such as Wisconsin, which we used to consider the prototypical Midwestern swing state. In the Republican wave year of 2010, Scott Walker was elected governor and Republicans seized control of both houses of the legislature. They immediately went on a tear, waging war on the state\u2019s unions and creating gerrymandered districts that solidified their control. The state government there produces a governing approach you\u2019d expect to find in a deep red state such as Alabama instead of a swing state.\n\nThis year, however, Walker is trailing Democrat Tony Evers in most polls, and the state Senate could flip to the Democrats as well. If Evers wins, it could change everything.\n\nThat\u2019s true in policy terms, of course \u2014 even if Republicans were to hold both houses of the legislature, they wouldn\u2019t be able to get reactionary legislation past the governor\u2019s veto, so they\u2019d have to compromise. Then we get to where some of the most important long-term consequences are: redistricting.\n\nThe governors elected this year will be in office when their states redistrict after the 2020 Census, which means they\u2019ll be in a position to stop the kind of brutal gerrymandering Republicans undertook after 2010. In Ohio, for instance, the congressional delegation is now 12 Republicans and only four Democrats. In Georgia, it\u2019s 10 Republicans and four Democrats. In Michigan, it\u2019s nine Republicans and five Democrats. If Democrats have a say in redistricting, those numbers will almost inevitably change.\n\nAnd it isn\u2019t just Congress; states will be redrawing their state legislative districts, as well. If Democrats aren\u2019t shut out of the process, they can demand some measure of fairness.\n\nOne of the most important stories in American politics in the past few years has been the way the GOP has worked so hard to alter the rules of the game once it gets power to make sure that it keeps it, even when it has the support of fewer voters than Democrats do. Party officials have been enormously successful at making that happen through gerrymandering and voter suppression. But if enough Democrats get elected governor, the timing is right to undo some of what they\u2019ve done and make the system more fair and representative. At least for a few years.", "\n\nRedskins Coach Jay Gruden checks on injured guard Brandon Scherff (75) during Sunday's loss to Atlanta. (Photo by Jonathan Newton / The Washington Post)\n\nThe Washington Redskins' playoff chances were dealt a major blow Monday, with the news that they will be without three offensive starters for the rest of the season. Coach Jay Gruden announced that right guard Brandon Scherff, left guard Shawn Lauvao and wide receiver Paul Richardson will all miss the remainder of the year because of injuries.\n\nScherff suffered a torn pectoral muscle and Lauvao a torn ACL in Sunday\u2019s 38-14 loss to the Atlanta Falcons. Richardson has been dealing with an injury to the AC joint in his shoulder for much of the season, and the team decided Monday to shut him down.\n\nThe injuries are a significant setback to a team that, following Sunday\u2019s blowout loss, is clinging to a one-game lead in the NFC East at the halfway point of the season.\n\nAn offense that has struggled to score points is now in particularly dire shape up front. Star left tackle Trent Williams missed the Atlanta game following thumb surgery, and he is expected to be out another two to three games.\n\n\u201cThat, obviously, has a major impact,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cYour two starting guards go out in the same game and you\u2019re already playing light at left tackle, it makes it difficult. . . . This is something you don\u2019t want to go through, but it is pro football and you have to go through it. Fortunately we have a very good offensive line coach in Coach [Bill] Callahan, and we\u2019ll figure it out and make it work.\u201d\n\n[Brewer: By choosing building blocks over playmakers, Redskins created a big imbalance]\n\nThe Redskins brought in six free agent offensive linemen for a workout Monday, and they signed guards Luke Bowanko and Jonathan Cooper and tackle Austin Howard in the afternoon. Howard started 16 games for the Baltimore Ravens last season at right tackle, Cooper was the No. 7 overall pick in 2013 by the Arizona Cardinals, and Bowanko was a sixth-round pick of the Jacksonville Jaguars in 2014.\n\nBefore the signings were announced, Gruden had said that one of the linemen the team ended up signing would likely need to start Sunday in a road game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\nRight tackle Morgan Moses injured the medial collateral ligament in his knee Sunday, but he is listed as day-to-day.\n\nThe receiving corps is also reeling following the loss of Richardson, who signed a five-year, $40 million free agent contract in the offseason. The Redskins were already without slot receiver Jamison Crowder, who has missed the team\u2019s past four games with an ankle injury and is no lock to return for the Buccaneers game. Pass-catching running back Chris Thompson is dealing with a rib injury that kept him out against the Falcons.\n\nRichardson will have surgery to repair the shoulder, and his recovery time is expected to be six to eight months.\n\n\u201cCommend him for his efforts trying to play for the eight weeks that he played,\u201d Gruden said, \u201cbut I think it\u2019s time to get it fixed.\u201d\n\nWashington will have to use its fourth starting offensive line combination of the year against Tampa Bay. It finished Sunday\u2019s loss with rookie Geron Christian making his NFL debut at left tackle, reserve swing tackle Ty Nsekhe at left guard, Chase Roullier at center, backup Tony Bergstrom at right guard and Moses at right tackle. The Redskins were down to their last active offensive linemen.\n\n\u201cWe have a couple prospects we worked out this morning that could come in here and play right away with experience and could help us out,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to demand a lot out of them, whoever that is, or we have to move some people around that are already here. . . . But we can\u2019t slow down. The train doesn\u2019t stop.\u201d\n\nCenter Casey Dunn is the only remaining offensive lineman on the 53-man roster who was not active Sunday. Tackles Timon Parris and Justin Evans are on the practice squad. Veteran Arie Kouandjio will not return in 2018 after going on injured reserve before the season.\n\n[Boswell: Beaten up and beaten bad, the Redskins are still 5-3 but face some tough questions]\n\nThe situation brings back memories of 2017, when Williams, Lauvao and Moses all finished the season on injured reserve \u2014 among 23 players in total.\n\n\u201cYou learned from last year that no matter who\u2019s next to you, you\u2019ve just got to continue to push on,\u201d Roullier said Monday. \u201cYou need to help guys learn positions quickly and just make sure you\u2019re communicating out there. Make sure any new guy that might come in, you need to help them out with things. That\u2019s why communication is very important and key to having success out there.\u201d\n\nThere are several challenges in mixing up the offensive line at this stage of the season. Any player who is newly signed or playing a new position needs extra time to learn the responsibilities in the Redskins' scheme, and there\u2019s the importance of acquiring a comfort level with new teammates.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always a balance,\u201d Roullier said. \u201cAs new guys come in, you need to teach them things. Coaches are going to be teaching them hard, probably extra meetings and all sorts of things. As other players, we\u2019re going to help out where we can there. . . . We\u2019re just going to go out there and play with the five guys they decide to put out there on the field.\u201d\n\nThe ground game has been the strength of the team\u2019s offense so far, but running back Adrian Peterson will now have to adjust to a new group up front.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something you don\u2019t prepare for, but when it does happen, this is what you have to do,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cWe have some guys developing in house that are young that have very little to zero NFL experience that we\u2019re trying to develop for the future, but not for Sunday. If we need to play them, we\u2019ll play them. But let\u2019s take a look at some of these veteran guys, see how they fare, see how they learn, see what kind of shape they\u2019re in and hopefully move forward.\u201d\n\nIn other injury news, Gruden said he hopes to get Crowder (ankle) back to practice Wednesday, but the wide receiver is still feeling a lot of pain when he runs and cuts. Cornerback Quinton Dunbar is listed as day-to-day as he continues to deal with a nerve issue in his lower leg.\n\nMore Redskins:\n\nRedskins\u2019 defense gets dominated in loss to Falcons: \u2018They went to work on us\u2019\n\nRedskins-Falcons takeaways: Injuries, penalties lead to a bad loss for Washington", "ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia \u2014 Eritrea is hoping that the U.N. Security Council will soon lift sanctions it imposed on the East African nation in 2009, now that its relations have thawed with Ethiopia and other neighboring countries.\n\nThe Security Council imposed an arms embargo and other tough sanctions on Eritrea for supplying weapons to al-Shabab Islamic militants opposed to the Somali government and for refusing to resolve a border dispute with neighboring Djibouti, a key U.S. ally in the Horn of Africa.\n\nA draft resolution obtained by The Associated Press would lift the arms embargoes, travel bans, asset freezes and targeted sanctions imposed in late 2009. It also urges Eritrea and Djibouti \u201cto continue efforts to settle their border dispute peacefully in a manner consistent with international law\u201d and to engage on Djibouti combatants missing in action.\n\nThe Security Council met privately Monday to hear from its committee monitoring sanctions on Eritrea and Somalia.\n\nThe draft resolution would also extend the arms embargo on Somalia until Nov. 15, 2019, as well as a ban on the import and export of Somali charcoal, a key source of income including for al-Shabab fighters.\n\nThe Security Council is scheduled to meet Nov. 14 to vote on an Eritrea-Somalia resolution.\n\nEritrea, a former Italian colony, gained independence from Ethiopia in 1993 after a 30-year guerrilla war. It had a decades-long border dispute with Ethiopia, including a war from 1998-2000 in which about 80,000 people died.\n\nBut the East African region saw an unprecedented level of diplomatic activity after Ethiopia\u2019s reformist Prime Minister, Abiy Ahmed, came to power in April and accepted a border decision by an international boundary commission that favored Eritrea.\n\nThe move set off a number of diplomatic thaws, including one between Eritrea and Somalia. Leaders of Djibouti and Eritrea, which also had a turbulent relationship after multiple border clashes, met in recent weeks with the help of regional power, Ethiopia, though no breakthrough was announced.\n\nEthiopia has lobbied for sanctions to be lifted against Eritrea.\n\n\u201cThe final decision will be made on November 14 . but the early signals coming out from New York are positive indeed,\u201d Eritrea\u2019s Minister of Information, Yemane Gebremeskel, tweeted on Saturday. \u201cTribute to Eritrea\u2019s steadfastness and resilience for nine long years.\u201d\n\nBut U.N. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, said Djibouti is unhappy about the possible lifting of sanctions against Eritrea because their dispute remains unresolved despite the reconciliation between Ethiopia and Eritrea.\n\nEritrea has denied providing any support to al-Shabab and has long accused Ethiopia of spearheading and influencing the sanctions against it. The draft resolution would condemn al-Shabab attacks in Somalia and beyond.\n\nAt the United Nations, Equatorial Guinea\u2019s ambassador, Anatolio Ndong Mba, welcomed \u201cthe new dynamic in the Horn of Africa.\u201d He said the Security Council committee monitoring sanctions on Eritrea \u201chasn\u2019t found any evidence\u201d that the country is helping al-Shabab.\n\n\u201cTherefore we are of the opinion that these sanctions should be lifted to send a message of a new dynamic in this Horn of Africa,\u201d he said as he headed into the council meeting. \u201cBut what we think also is that Djibouti should be part of all this dynamic.\u201d\n\nThe Netherlands\u2019 deputy U.N. ambassador, Lise Gregoire Van Haaren, also a council member, said, \u201cWe certainly think a revision of the sanctions is warranted and we should also support the positive developments.\u201d\n\nBut at the same time, she noted the Netherlands has a large Eritrean diaspora and said extortion and threats of force against them is \u201ca very sensitive topic.\u201d That is \u201cpolitically high on the agenda\u201d in her country and must be taken into account in any decision, she said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Edith M.

(Matt Dunham/AP)\n\nLONDON \u2014 They burned a cardboard model of Grenfell Tower and mocked the victims. Now they\u2019ve been arrested.\n\nFive men turned themselves in to a South London police station Monday night and were arrested on suspicion of a public order offense, the Metropolitan Police Service said in a statement Tuesday. The men, between 19 and 55 years old, remain in police custody.\n\nIn a video of the act, a man can be heard jeering, \u201cThat\u2019s what happens when they don\u2019t pay their rent,\u201d as the model goes up in flames.\n\nThe video, believed to have been recorded and shared on a messaging app, quickly went viral on Twitter. By Monday evening, it was trending in Britain, with thousands expressing shock and disbelief at the insensitivity of the group. The total number of people involved in the video is unknown.\n\nThe Grenfell Tower tragedy was the deadliest fire in modern British history and claimed more than 70 lives in June 2017. Witnesses described how children disappeared behind clouds of thick smoke as flames engulfed the high-rise apartment building in West London. Residents were forced to flee, remain in sweltering temperatures or jump.\n\nTV presenter Alex Beresford was one of many people who shared the video Monday, calling the footage \u201cdisgusting\u201d and \u201cpure evil racism.\u201d\n\nIn the footage, which some may find disturbing, the cardboard model, with the words \u201cGrenfell Tower\u201d written at the top, is seen being handled by a group of people. Echoing the real-life tragedy, the model depicts people at windows with their arms outstretched and a person dangling outside the building.\n\n\u201cBye, everyone!\u201d jeers one member of the group as the design is carried toward a glowing bonfire. \u201cHelp me, help me!\u201d shrieks another, seemingly mocking the last words of some of the victims. \u201cWe\u2019re coming to get you!\u201d yells another participant, referring to the promises of emergency workers who instructed residents to stay in place and wait for help \u2014 help that didn\u2019t reach them in time.\n\nIn the video, a chorus of laughter can be heard as the model eventually goes up in flames. In the background, a St. George\u2019s flag can be seen. The banner, a red cross on a white field, is the traditional flag of England and has increasingly been adopted by the far right in Britain.\n\nOn Twitter on Monday evening, London Mayor Sadiq Khan said: \u201cI utterly condemn this sickening video. The horrific Grenfell Tower fire was one of the most devastating tragedies our city has ever suffered \u2014 and I urge social media companies to do the right thing and remove this content immediately.\u201d\n\nAs disgust about the video rapidly spread on social media, British Prime Minister Theresa May said, \u201cTo disrespect those who lost their lives at Grenfell Tower, as well as their families and loved ones, is utterly unacceptable.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, London\u2019s Metropolitan Police Service called the video \u201cvile\u201d and urged people with information to come forward. It also urged anyone present at the gathering to come forward.\n\nCmdr. Stuart Cundy, who is leading the Grenfell Tower investigation, said in the statement: \u201cI am frankly appalled by the callous nature of the video posted online. A total of 71 people died in the fire at Grenfell Tower, so many people lost so many loved ones and many more have been deeply affected. To mock the disaster in such a crude way is vile.\n\n\"I can\u2019t imagine the distress this video will undoubtedly cause to bereaved families and survivors.\n\n\u201cThe Met\u2019s Grenfell Tower investigation team is taking this matter very seriously. Any offenses that have been committed will be fully investigated.\u201d\n\nFor many in Britain, what happened at Grenfell Tower is a hugely delicate subject, with the tragedy at the center of conversations about race relations in Britain, adequacy of public housing and what could have been done to prevent the inferno. The memories of what happened continue to haunt survivors, families of the victims, the local community and, more broadly, the country.

Zinke authorized him to access the property and explained that he was engaged in negotiations with a real estate developer over building a parking lot on his foundation\u2019s land. But under an ethics pledge he signed Jan. 10, 2017, Zinke vowed to step down from his position as president of the Great Northern Veterans Peace Park Foundation after winning confirmation and refrain from participating in any matters concerning the group for one year.\n\nZinke won confirmation on March 1, 2017, but state records and the foundation\u2019s 2018 annual report listed him as continuing to serve as a foundation officer months after that. Zinke later said the foundation\u2019s report was in error.\n\nIn his ethics pledge, the interior secretary said: \u201cI will not participate personally and substantially in any particular matter involving specific parties in which I know this entity is a party or represents a party, unless I am first authorized to participate.\u201d\n\nNeither the Interior Department nor Zinke attorney Stephen M. Ryan responded to requests for comment.\n\nZinke\u2019s involvement in a land development deal involving the park, backed by David J. Lesar, chairman of the oil services firm Halliburton, is under scrutiny from the Justice Department and the Interior Department\u2019s Office of Inspector General. The business and retail project, known as 95 Karrow, involves the construction of a parking lot on the foundation\u2019s land and would lie near land owned by Zinke and his wife, Lola.\n\nDon Fox, a former acting director and general counsel at the Office of Government Ethics, said in a phone interview that the fact that Zinke continued to conduct foundation business after agreeing to stop raised questions about his overall conduct.\n\n\u201cIn the whole panoply of ethics violations, is this a major one? No,\u201d Fox said, but adding that most Cabinet members adhere strictly to the terms of their ethics pledges. \u201cThe thing, I think, is the totally callous disregard for the standards and norms that previous administration officials have complied with, because it\u2019s such a very easy thing to comply with.\u201d\n\nBefore boarding Air Force One at Joint Base Andrews on Monday, President Trump praised Zinke\u2019s record but told reporters he was scrutinizing his conduct.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to look at any reports.

But I will take a look,\" Trump said. \"But he has done a very good job as secretary.\u201d\n\nThe discussion between Zinke and Taylor focused on two local planning questions \u2014 whether Taylor and others could set up a disc-golf park on the site and whether part of it would be converted into a parking lot. In an Aug. 10, 2017, email, Taylor asked whether he and his friends could set up a course to ensure the park \u2014 which includes a sledding hill \u2014 \u201cgets used more in the non-winter months.\u201d\n\nThe park, which is primarily on land that BNSF Railway donated to the Zinkes' foundation over the past decade, is open to the public but largely undeveloped. The state highway used it as a staging site for a couple of years, Taylor said in a phone interview, and it includes a small pond that is also used for skating. It is gated and inaccessible by car, though residents can walk into the park easily.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s basically a passive recreation area,\u201d Taylor said, noting that residents walk their dogs, go running and occasionally hold picnics there.\n\nIn his Aug. 13 reply to Taylor, Zinke said that it would be fine to erect a disc-golf course for his and his friends' personal use and that he was pursuing the construction of a parking lot.\n\n\u201cDave, U and your friends are always welcome to use the park,\u201d Zinke wrote, providing him with the access code to its gate so that they could enter with vehicles. \u201cI would rather keep it to friends until a master plan is developed.\u201d\n\nIn an another exchange with Taylor, on June 21, 2018, Zinke criticized the initial Politico report that raised questions about his involvement in the 95 Karrow development. \u201cOnly fake news would make a mountain out of a sledding hill for kids,\u201d the secretary wrote. \u201cAs usual, the park is just trying to help whitefish on what appears to be a good project.\u201d\n\nBut Chris Saeger, who directs the liberal advocacy group Western Values Project, said in an email that the correspondence shows that Zinke was misusing his nonprofit.\n\n\u201cRyan Zinke broke his promise to the citizens of Whitefish to build this park for the public,\u201d said Saeger, whose group is based in Whitefish. \u201cMaking it available only to his friends while shutting out the rest of us says everything about his approach to managing public lands.\u201d\n\nTaylor said the disc-golf course has yet to be set up, though the city has long identified it as a priority in its parks and recreation plan. \u201cThere\u2019s no other real activities happening there,\u201d aside from sledding and people passing through, he said.\n\nJosh Dawsey contributed to this report.", "If Democrats win the House majority on Tuesday, Rep.

(Tamir Kalifa for The Washington Post)\n\nPelosi also laid the groundwork for an argument that could carry special relevance to a crop of incoming lawmakers who have all run on protecting access to affordable health care: Not only is she a key architect of the very legislation they want to protect, she orchestrated the campaign to protect it \u2014 one that began in the days after Trump\u2019s election.\n\n\u201cAs soon as he won, we knew that the Affordable Care Act was at risk and that we needed to mobilize and organize to protect it, and we had a plan to do so,\u201d she said, carefully highlighting the efforts of grass-roots activists and outside organizers while also making her own central role clear: \u201cWe made our own environment.\u201d\n\nThe health-care law could be the key to Pelosi\u2019s redemption.\n\nIn March 2010, Pelosi muscled the sweeping bill through the House, rejecting the notion months earlier from Obama administration officials that the party opt for a scaled-back version. \u201cKiddie care,\u2019\u2019 she dismissively told White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel.\n\nThat November, in large part due to the unpopular law, the party suffered a crushing loss of 63 House seats and its majority.\n\nThis year, Pelosi\u2019s singular focus on GOP efforts to weaken the law\u2019s core protection for Americans with preexisting medical conditions could be the defining issue of the election and help Democrats reclaim the majority.\n\nPelosi has mostly brushed off her critics inside the party, who have argued that she has long been a political drag on Democratic candidates in potentially winnable districts. Inside the House Democratic Caucus, however, the frustrations have never reached escape velocity, and her allies are once again ready to argue that no one is better equipped to lead.\n\nRep. Ra\u00fal M. Grijalva (D-Ariz.), chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus and a Pelosi ally, posed a question new members will face when they get to Washington: \u201cWho could put the foot on the gas and move us?\u201d A restless Democratic base will \u201cwant to see movement,\u201d he said, and no one will be ready to move faster than Pelosi.\n\nBut to Moulton and a small group of like-minded Democrats, those kinds of arguments are at best patronizing and at worst insulting to dozens of other House Democrats who have been eager to inject new blood into the leadership only to see the top three septuagenarians \u2014 Pelosi, 78, Minority Whip Steny H. Hoyer (Md.), 79, and Assistant Democratic Leader James E. Clyburn (S.C.), 78 \u2014 consolidate power even after losing four straight elections.\n\n[\u2018There has to be a transition at some point,\u2019 Pelosi says about Democratic leadership]\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about people looking at the Democratic Party and saying, \u2018I want to follow you,\u2019 \u201d Moulton said in an interview after addressing the Kentucky Democrats. \u201cI don\u2019t think people look at our current leadership and say, \u2018Oh, there\u2019s the future of the Democratic Party.\u2019 But people in here look at Amy, and they say, \u2018That\u2019s the future of the party.\u2019 \u201d\n\nMcGrath, a former Marine Corps fighter pilot, has aggressively called for a \u201cnew generation of leaders.\u201d But she has pointedly not said how she would vote on Pelosi.\n\nIn Kentucky, where Democrats are reeling after having been dominant in state politics for generations, party loyalists share plenty of Pelosi fatigue. Her political baggage has even sifted down into local politics, where one Democratic candidate running for state representative has seen her Republican opponent send mailers featuring Pelosi\u2019s face.\n\nVic Ferguson, a Paris, Ky., farmer whose daughter Emily was the subject of the mailer, said he feared that Pelosi\u2019s continued tenure could make Kentucky Democrats extinct.\n\n\u201cWe might as well just go to the stockyard and just line up in the cattle chutes, and go for the slaughter,\u201d he said. \u201cIf that\u2019s her ego that\u2019s keeping her\u201d as leader, he added, \u201cwe all sacrifice for that.\u201d\n\nMcGrath said she is primarily frustrated that the party leadership \u2014 coastal, long-tenured and just plain old \u2014 doesn\u2019t represent the full breadth of the party.\n\n\u201cI mean, the Democratic Party is the party of young people. Young people! But where is our leadership?\u201d she said. \u201cThe Republican Party does such a better job of grooming the next generation of Republican leaders. The Democratic Party does not, and I think that we need to change that.\u201d\n\nBut what McGrath says next is exactly what Pelosi and her allies are counting on \u2014 that, when it comes time to vote for a speaker, she would probably support a Democrat who might not be her first choice over a Republican.\n\n\u201cI want to do what\u2019s right for the country,\u201d she said. \u201cSo if it\u2019s between somebody here, and, you know, a Paul Ryan, who I think has been a disaster, I can tell you who I\u2019m not voting for.\u201d\n\nMoulton said there\u2019s \u201cno litmus test\u201d on party leadership for any candidate receiving his support, but the candidates supported by his Serve America PAC and a related joint fundraising committee are among the most vocal about changing party leadership. Most of them, however, are in tougher races than McGrath\u2019s, and the sort of Democratic wave that would elect them could also bolster Pelosi\u2019s case for the speakership.\n\n[Is Nancy Pelosi in trouble?]\n\nAnd while a handful of House Democrats \u2014 including Moulton, Rep. Kathleen Rice (D-N.Y.) and Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio) \u2014 have been outspoken in seeking to upend the party leadership, none is actually seeking to challenge Pelosi or any other party leader. Moulton, who has openly floated a 2020 presidential run, insists he is not running for anything except his own reelection.\n\nRyan, who ran unsuccessfully against Pelosi in 2016, hinted he would consider another run in a Sunday Fox News Channel interview, saying the party leadership elections \u201cwill not be a coronation.\u201d\n\nMoulton said plenty of candidates will emerge once it becomes clear that Pelosi can\u2019t win the 218 floor votes she will need to become speaker. And, he argues, she will be vulnerable even if, perhaps especially if, there is a Democratic wave.\n\n\u201cFor our party to respond [to a wave] by saying . . . we\u2019re going to reinstall the exact same status-quo leadership that you voted out many years ago, it\u2019s just shooting ourselves in the foot,\u201d he said. \u201cIt guarantees a two-year majority.\u201d\n\n[Pelosi is the star of GOP attack ads, worrying Democrats upbeat about midterms]\n\nMeanwhile, Pelosi has spent the past month staying far above party infighting \u2014 crisscrossing the country for Democratic candidates willing to stump with her, predicting victory in a late-night TV interview \u2014 and reminding Democrats why Republicans spend so much money attacking her.\n\n\u201cBecause I\u2019m a master, politically astute, big-time fundraiser,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause I\u2019m a master legislator, I know the subjects. . . .

(Evan Vucci/AP)\n\nNo Republican president has won the black vote in the years it has been tracked, going back to the Voting Rights Act of 1965. But President Trump arguably tried in 2016 \u2014 albeit in an incredibly unorthodox way, like much of the rest of his campaign.\n\nDuring his presidential campaign, Trump challenged black voters to give him a shot at following Barack Obama, the first black president in American history. Despite making multiple offensive comments, repeatedly attacking the popular Obama, and his own history of racial profiling and discrimination, Trump won a higher percentage of black voters than the 2012 Republican presidential nominee. But in the first election that is a referendum on his presidency, Trump appears to have abandoned any effort to turn out black voters for his party.\n\nTrump strayed from his prepared remarks to make one of these appeals to black voters before a predominantly white crowd in Akron, Ohio, in August 2016. He said:\n\nOur government has totally failed our African American friends, our Hispanic friends and the people of our country. Period. The Democrats have failed completely in the inner cities. For those hurting the most who have been failed and failed by their politicians \u2014 year after year, failure after failure, worse numbers after worse numbers. Poverty. Rejection. Horrible education. No housing, no homes, no ownership. Crime at levels that nobody has seen. You can go to war zones in countries that we are fighting and it\u2019s safer than living in some of our inner cities that are run by the Democrats. And I ask you this, I ask you this \u2014 crime, all of the problems \u2014 to the African Americans, who I employ so many, so many people, to the Hispanics, tremendous people: What the hell do you have to lose? Give me a chance. I\u2019ll straighten it out. I\u2019ll straighten it out. What do you have to lose?\n\nMany black voters labeled his portrayal of the black American experience as offensive and condescending before ultimately choosing to support Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\nSince 2016, there have been even fewer African Americans vouching publicly for Trump.\n\nTrump\u2019s African American campaign surrogates Katrina Pierson and Paris Dennard are no longer daily fixtures on CNN. YouTube stars Diamond and Silk, who regularly attack liberal black lawmakers while defending Trump, are no longer campaign rally staples. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, the Trump surrogate with the most notoriety in the black community before launching his own presidential bid, has pretty much disappeared from campaign activities. And Omarosa Manigault Newman, once the most powerful black person in the White House, has the rare distinction of having been fired from both Trump\u2019s reality show and White House.\n\nWhile all of them still support Trump except for Manigault Newman, who now claims that her former boss is racist, they have not been dispatched across America to rally black votes for Trump-endorsed Republicans. Part of that may be because after a failed effort apparently orchestrated by hip-hop artist Kanye West, Trump seems for the moment to have given up on trying to convince black voters that his vision of a great America includes them.\n\nThe black unemployment rate hit its lowest number in history during Trump\u2019s presidency, but the president hasn\u2019t gone to places with large percentages of black residents to convince voters that this trend could continue under his watch. Most of his rallies have been in the small cities with large percentages of the white working-class voters that occupy a significant piece of his base and away from the inner cities that he promised to reform.\n\nOne of the positions that Trump appeared to assume once he entered the White House is Chief Culture Warrior. When given the choice between addressing the cultural concerns of his mostly white base, who cited immigration and discrimination against white Americans among their major fears during the 2016 election, and black Americans, who have regularly criticized Trump\u2019s positions on the Charlottesville shooting, the National Football League protest debate and immigration from predominantly black countries, the president has chosen to stick to his base.\n\nPresidents usually use midterm elections to expand their base and attempt to win over people who did not previously support them. But it all makes sense if you consider the argument made by Ta-Nehisi Coates in the Atlantic that Trump is \u201cthe First White President.\u201d\n\nFew groups give Trump lower approval rating than black Americans. According to the Quinnipiac University poll, only 8 percent of black Americans approve of him. But the president remains relatively popular with those groups who helped send him to the White House, including white Americans, the ethnic group giving Trump the highest approval (49 percent).\n\nIn theory, Trump could have crossed the country delivering a multipronged message to Americans of different ethnic groups about why the GOP is the best political group to advance the United States. But that\u2019s not what got Trump to the White House. Stoking fears did. And instead of making a potentially laughable effort to convince black Americans that he wants to improve their lives, Trump has chosen to address the concerns of white Americans in his base.", "\n\nPrince Turki bin Abdullah, seen welcoming guests to pay tribute to the late King Abdullah in 2015, is among an unknown number of Saudis detained by order of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. (Dmitry Astakhov/AFP/Getty Images)\n\n\u2014 Somewhere in this kingdom, Prince Turki bin Abdullah is locked away.\n\nTurki, 47, was once a golden scion of Saudi Arabia\u2019s gilded royal family, a prominent son of the late King Abdullah and a fighter pilot with advanced degrees who trained in the United States and Britain. He was the powerful governor of Riyadh province, then chief executive of the multibillion-dollar King Abdullah Foundation, which funds charitable work around the world.\n\nHe is now among an unknown number of super-wealthy Saudis who remain detained a full year after Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman startled his country by turning Riyadh\u2019s posh Ritz-Carlton hotel into a five-star jail for some of the nation\u2019s most prominent citizens in what he called an anti-corruption sweep.\n\nTurki, whom officials have reportedly accused of graft related to construction of the Riyadh subway, remains detained without any formal charges. His chief of staff, Gen. Ali al-Qahtani, was also arrested and died in detention under circumstances that have never been fully explained.\n\nEarly this year, the Saudi attorney general said 56 men remained locked up, some the subject of criminal investigations, with more than $106 billion in cash, real estate, businesses, securities and other assets recovered in the Ritz operation.\n\nMohammed said in an interview last month with Bloomberg News that only eight men were still being detained. He offered no other details except to say, \u201cThey\u2019re with their lawyers and facing the system that we have in Saudi Arabia.\u201d\n\nBut other people familiar with the detentions said the number is much higher, with 45 Ritz detainees still locked up.\n\nOne of those may have won his freedom Friday when Saudi authorities released Prince Khaled bin Talal, 56, a cousin of Mohammed and Turki. Khaled is a businessman and noted religious conservative who reportedly opposed the crown prince\u2019s decision to strip power from the country\u2019s notorious religious \u00adpolice.\n\nHuman rights activists and other analysts said Mohammed may be preparing to release more of the detainees to help cool the international furor over the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi on Oct. 2. Khashoggi\u2019s death inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul at the hands of Saudi agents has strained relations with Washington and Europe and drawn attention to the crown prince\u2019s human rights practices, including his record of locking up scores of his critics.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want to do it, but they are under pressure, and they will do it to release some pressure,\u201d said Yahya Assiri, a Saudi human rights activist living in self-exile in London.\n\nBut he cautioned against overstating the importance of the release of Khaled, suggesting it was done mainly to shore up support for Mohammed within the royal family at a time when the crown prince and his father, the current monarch, King Salman, are under stress.\n\n\u201cI think this is trying to show family unity in the face of scrutiny,\u201d said Adam Coogle, a Middle East researcher for Human Rights Watch who closely monitors the kingdom.\n\nMohammed\u2019s roundup of wealthy Saudis a year ago helped cement his control over many of the country\u2019s most powerful individuals and neutralized potential political rivals within the royal family.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about money and power,\u201d said a person close to the royal family. \u201cMohammed bin Salman understands that if you take away their money, you take away their power.\u201d\n\nFaced with long detentions or other punishment, some of the Ritz detainees agreed to hand over the demanded cash, which often amounted to most of their net worth, according to accounts from family, friends and human rights groups.\n\nMany Saudis and foreign observers have applauded Mohammed for what they view as a long-overdue reckoning for the clubby culture of royals and well-connected families, who have long treated Saudi Arabia\u2019s land, oil and riches as their own.\n\nBut others see the detentions \u2014 and reports of torture at the Ritz \u2014 as a brutal move by Mohammed to settle scores and solidify his personal power. Critics say that explanation fits with his record of arresting scores of human rights and women\u2019s rights activists and even clerics who disagree with his policies.\n\nSaudi officials strongly deny that anyone has been tortured. \u201cThat is not who we are,\u201d one official said. \u201cWe do not torture. That word has never been in our vocabulary in Saudi Arabia.\u201d\n\nFamily tensions\n\nThe crown prince appears to have targeted the family of the late King Abdullah in particular. Several observers said it is the product of tensions between the Salman and Abdullah wings of the family that go back many years but became especially pronounced because of Mohammed\u2019s rapid rise to power.\n\n\n\nKing Abdullah with other royal family princes during the funeral of his brother Prince Sattam bin Abdel Aziz in 2013. (Saudi Press Agency/AP)\n\nTurki in recent years had grown increasingly concerned at the signs of Mohammed\u2019s accumulation of power, especially his control of an investigative unit in the Interior Ministry \u201cthat could be used to make all sorts of accusations,\u201d said one of the people close to the royal family.\n\nIn addition to jailing Turki, Mohammed also arrested three of Abdullah\u2019s other sons, including Prince Muteib bin Abdullah, 65, head of the national guard, who was fired from his job. Two other sons, Prince Faisal bin Abdullah, 40, a former head of the Saudi Red Crescent Authority,and Prince Mishaal bin Abdullah, a former governor of Mecca province, were briefly detained after they complained about the death of Qahtani, 55, who had been \u201cin the peak of health\u201d when he was arrested, according to the person close to the royal family.\n\n\n\nPrince Salman bin Abdul Aziz bin Salman, left, who was imprisoned in January, at a function with King Salman\u2019s brother, Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz, in August 2017. (Obtained by The Washington Post)\n\nAlso detained two months after the initial Ritz roundup was Prince Salman bin Abdul Aziz bin Salman, 36, who is married to a daughter of King Abdullah. His father was also arrested, and the two remain in detention with no formal charges filed, according to his lawyer.\n\nSeveral people with ties to the royal family said Mohammed\u2019s focus on Abdullah\u2019s family seemed designed to sideline potential rivals for power and to seize control of the King Abdullah Foundation fund, overseen by Turki, which is estimated to be worth $20 billion to $30 billion.\n\nKing Salman, while still governor of Riyadh province, began grooming his son for leadership roles, naming him as a top adviser when Mohammed was in his early twenties. When Salman became crown prince in 2012, also serving as defense minister, Mohammed was again installed as a top adviser.\n\nAt the time, King Abdullah was worried about Mohammed\u2019s rapid ascent, according to a former Western diplomat with decades of experience in Riyadh. \u201cKing Abdullah was concerned about that kind of authority being given to the young fella, who was not even 30 yet,\u201d the diplomat said.\n\nAbout a decade ago, Mohammed drew King Abdullah\u2019s ire when a top economic adviser complained to the monarch about Mohammed\u2019s stock market investments, prompting the royal court to \u201ccensure\u201d Mohammed, according to a person close to the royal family.\n\nLater, Mohammed again angered King Abdullah by firing a number of deputies in the Defense Ministry, that person said. Abdullah moved to ban Mohammed from the ministry.\n\nThe resentments ran both ways.

(Julie Jacobson/AP)\n\nMedia critic\n\nBack in the early years of the Obama administration, Fox News host Sean Hannity used his popular program to boost conservative activism. The fiery host was a celebrity at tea party rallies, including one in Georgia in 2009: \u201cIf we go through these numbers and we\u2019re going to spend and create $10 trillion in debt and 10 years from now $806 billion in interest on that debt. This is unsustainable, and America has a message tonight for the White House. Fifteen or 20 thousand strong here in Atlanta: Leave our children and grandchildren\u2019s money alone,\u201d said the host, as the crowd roared.\n\nIn those days, however, the folks in Fox News headquarters exerted a bit of control over their prime-time talk-show star. For instance: When Hannity decamped to Cincinnati in April 2010 to cheer on the tea party, he was recalled to New York. The reason? Ethics, believe it or not. Executives at the network grew concerned that tea party organizers were using Hannity\u2019s presence to raise funds. \u201cI\u2019m doing a big post-mortem and trying to get to the bottom of it,\u201d said Bill Shine (then Fox\u2019s executive vice president of programming, now a White House aide) at the time.\n\nSafe to say that no one at Fox News will be trying to \u201cget to the bottom\u201d of Hannity\u2019s latest flurry of activism. As announced on Sunday, Hannity will be a \u201cspecial guest,\u201d along with talk radio host Rush Limbaugh and country singer Lee Greenwood, at a rally with President Trump in Cape Girardeau, Mo., on the eve of the 2018 midterm elections. Here\u2019s how the sign-up form appears on the Trump campaign website:\n\nCarly Shanahan of the Fox News PR department didn\u2019t respond to questions about the arrangements. However, a \u201cspokesperson\u201d for the network told the Hill that \u201cHannity will be hosting his show from the rally location and interviewing Trump.\u201d\n\nHannity himself has sought to bring clarity to whether he\u2019d be appearing onstage with Trump:\n\nIn spite of reports, I will be doing a live show from Cape Girardeau and interviewing President Trump before the rally. To be clear, I will not be on stage campaigning with the President. I am covering final rally for my show. Something I have done in every election in the past. \u2014 Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) November 5, 2018\n\nSuch proximity isn\u2019t altogether unprecedented. In October 2017, Hannity \u201cinterviewed\u201d Trump at a rally in Pennsylvania for Trump\u2019s tax plan. Hannity: \u201cIs he going to win Pennsylvania in 2020, too?\u201d Crowd: \u201cYay!\u201d\n\nAnd in September, Hannity \u201cinterviewed\u201d Trump at a Las Vegas rally. The tone was propagandistic from the very start. \u201cThere he is, the commander in chief, and here comes the music, and here come the flags. Obviously, a lot of \u2014 the crowd in this arena is huge as we come to you from the Vegas Convention Center,\u201d said Hannity, who began with these pleasantries: \u201cMr. President, how are you sir? It is an honor to see you. Wave to the fake news media.\u201d\n\nThrough his promotion of Trump at events such as those; through his nightly fealty to Trump talking points and utter Trump worship; through his craven and successful attempt to lead Trump supporters in a round of applause for Trump\u2019s Muslim ban; through his status as an unofficial adviser to Trump the candidate and later Trump the president; through the provision of Hannity\u2019s private jet to take a vice-presidential candidate to meet with Trump; through the sheer coincidence that his good friend and former colleague \u2014 Shine, that is \u2014 snagged a top job in the White House; through his appearance in a Trump campaign video promotion during the 2016 race; through those frequent phone calls, Hannity has become every bit as invested in the Trump presidency as a White House adviser or even the president himself.\n\nOne pro-Trump cheer after another has solidified \u201cHannity\u201d as the No. 1 program on cable news. And that consideration appears to outweigh any ethical concerns at Fox News that \u201cHannity\u201d has become a wholly owned subsidiary of WhiteHouse.gov.\n\nAll signposts are arrayed in one direction: Hannity owns Fox News. He owns the Fox News identity. He owns the Fox News management. He owns the Fox News branding. He owns the Fox News standards guide, if indeed such a thing still exists. He owns the Fox News programming. He owns the Fox News everything.\n\nWhenever discussing the line-crossing of Hannity or the craziness of Tucker Carlson, it\u2019s customary to include a nod to the more newsy stretches of the Fox News schedule. Hosts such as Shepard Smith, Harris Faulkner, Bill Hemmer, Chris Wallace and Sandra Smith, that is. Lachlan Murdoch, the executive chairman of 21st Century Fox, mentioned the network\u2019s straight-news cluster last week in defending Fox News from critics.\n\nSure, great: Those folks don\u2019t do what Hannity does. And they\u2019re powerless to stop him from doing so.", "\n\nPresident Trump stops to talk to reporters and members of the media at the White House on Oct. 26 in Washington. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nOpinion writer\n\nWhen I see a headline like this one from the New York Times \u2014 \u201cBrian Kemp\u2019s Office, Without Citing Evidence, Investigates Georgia Democrats Over Alleged \u2018Hack\u2019 \u201d \u2014 it\u2019s obvious that a key lesson from the 2016 presidential race has not been learned: Don\u2019t simply repeat charges with the presumption of validity. Not every outlet got it right, right away. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution\u2019s reporter initially reported Kemp\u2019s claim as if it were plausible, earning rebukes on social media. Monday, however, the paper reported:\n\nKemp is now facing renewed scrutiny after his office announced Sunday \u2014 without providing evidence and doing so just hours before Election Day \u2014 that it is investigating the Georgia Democratic Party for an alleged hack of the state\u2019s voter registration system. The move to publicly disclose the probe appeared to break with tradition in the office, which oversees voting integrity, as it differed from how Kemp\u2019s team handled an earlier cyber breach at Kennesaw State University.\n\nWhen I see media criticism rain down on Axios for its hyped reported about President Trump\u2019s \u201cplan\u201d to abolish birthright citizenship, failing to note the inaccuracies in Trump\u2019s false assertion that only the United States has birthright citizenship or to point out that it\u2019s impossible to change the 14th Amendment by executive order, we can see that some, but not all, outlets have learned to fact-check before leaping. (Still, a lack of explanation, let alone a mea culpa, from Axios suggests less willingness to adhere to the journalistic standards of its competitors.)\n\nWhen I see that CNN President Jeff Zucker, according to a Politico report, has decided that he is \u201cnot interested in hiring former [Trump administration] officials he perceives as complicit in spreading falsehoods or spurious talking points, according to four people familiar with the conversation,\u201d I can see journalistic discernment. But why then is someone such as Marc Short, formerly in charge of the White House\u2019s legislative affairs, still on air making a false equivalence between Trump\u2019s incendiary language and former president Barack Obama (who merely relates facts, such as the number of Trump cronies indicted)?\n\nWhen I see that CNN and MSNBC (disclosure: I am an MSNBC contributor) now refuse to show Trump\u2019s rallies \u2014 filled with lies and anti-immigrant fear-mongering \u2014 live, it\u2019s clear they\u2019ve learned that giving Trump hours upon hours of free air time without context, fact-checking or equal time for opponents is journalistic malpractice. However, days of front-page and lead TV news stories about the caravan \u2014 a thousand miles off \u2014 amounted to free, misleading ads for Trump\u2019s xenophobic campaign.\n\nAnd why, unlike CNN, did NBC, barely a week after the slaughter in Pittsburgh by an anti-Semite convinced that Jews were bringing in \u201cinvaders,\u201d air Trump\u2019s closing immigration ad, which is demonstrably false and blatantly racist? Granted, as the New York Times noted, the most glaring untruth \u2014 the false claim that Democrats were responsible for letting a cop killer into the United States \u2014 was not included in the ad, \u201cbut it still drew a direct connection from immigrants to crime, a tactic the president has repeatedly used. (Many studies have shown immigrants do not drive an increase in crime.)\u201d (NBC on Monday said it would stop airing the ad.)\n\nFinally, when you see more caveats from analysts interpreting polls, you can see they\u2019ve internalized some of the lessons of 2016 (i.e. \u201cmargin of error\u201d has real meaning). And yet I see near-uniform predictions that Republicans will keep the Senate, which \u201cfeels\u201d accurate but seems excessively confident. Moreover, given the enormous turnout, analysts and pollsters probably should concede they have far less insight than normal into what the electorate will look like.\n\nIn sum, while Fox continues its descent into journalistic self-destruction (Sean Hannity attending Trump\u2019s final midterm rally, for example, seems horridly perfect), the \u201cmedia\u201d or \u201cthe mainstream media\u201d cannot be given a uniform rating. There are more conscientious and less conscientious outlets, TV outlets more willing regularly to invite inveterate prevaricators like Kellyanne Conway on the air and others more insistent that they not be used as Trump\u2019s mouthpiece.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen in the past two weeks that Trump\u2019s lies and racism can have deadly consequences. If for no other reason, news outlets need to remain vigilant about reflexively transmitting Trump\u2019s false, toxic rhetoric.

(Ulysses Munoz/AP)\n\nIt was not your typical November storm system that turned violent over Mount Airy and Baltimore on Friday night.\n\nA dangerous squall line swept across the Washington and Baltimore region, spawning two tornadoes \u2014 the second of which resulted in two fatalities.\n\nThe tornado deaths were the first on record in the state of Maryland between the months of October and March, and they were also the state\u2019s first since a violent tornado struck La Plata in 2002.\n\nAt 9:42 p.m., a tornado ripped through parts of Baltimore and Dundalk, with peak winds of 105 mph, leaving a 2.5-mile-long trail of destruction and killing two workers at an Amazon distribution warehouse.\n\n[Second body found in collapsed Baltimore warehouse after tornado]\n\n\n\nThe path of Friday night's tornado in Baltimore. The tornado reached maximum intensity right as it clipped the Amazon distribution center's BWI5 building, ripping part of the roof off. (NWS)\n\nThe Baltimore tornado was preceded by a tornado that roared through Mount Airy at 8:20 p.m., with peak winds of 100 mph. That tornado was on the ground for 4.7 miles.\n\nHere are the damage survey results from an EF-1 tornado that struck the Mt. Airy area in Carroll County last evening. Public Information Statement can be found at the top of our website at https://t.co/2AXFNweZIf pic.twitter.com/99Q6aaWmwp \u2014 NWS DC/Baltimore (@NWS_BaltWash) November 4, 2018\n\nBoth tornadoes were rated EF-1 by the National Weather Service forecast office in Sterling, Va. The EF or Enhanced Fujita scale ranges from 0 through 5. EF-0 and EF-1 tornadoes are considered \u201cweak\u201d on the tornado intensity spectrum but, in some cases, are still devastating.\n\nIn addition to the tornadoes, torrential rain caused localized flooding in spots, and straight-line winds gusted to 40 to 50 mph in several locations, with a measured gust of 71 mph in Carroll County.\n\nWhile forecasters had indicated that there was a somewhat elevated chance of severe weather Friday night, neither severe thunderstorm nor tornado watches were in effect in the hours before the storms struck.\n\nThe National Weather Service also did not issue a tornado warning for either twister, although it had issued a severe thunderstorm warning before the tornado touched down in Baltimore.\n\nChris Strong, warning coordination meteorologist at the National Weather Service office serving the Washington and Baltimore region, said his team is reviewing what happened Friday night and could not yet speak about why more warning wasn\u2019t provided.\n\n\u201cThis week we\u2019re going to talk to the team to get their perspectives about what went wrong and what it could\u2019ve done better,\u201d Strong said.\n\nFormation\n\nThe tornadoes were not spawned by discrete supercell thunderstorms, the most common source. Rather, they formed along an intense squall line known as a quasi-linear convective system (QLCS).\n\nThe term \u201cquasi-linear\u201d refers to the bowing or undulating appearance of the storm on weather radar, presenting as a series of wavelike lobes and clefts. The image below shows this extensive line crossing central Maryland around 9 p.m.\n\n\n\nDangerous squall line advancing across DMV Friday evening, as shown by weather radar. RadarScope.com. (RadarScope.com)\n\nThis QLCS was traveling toward the northeast at 30 to 40 mph, and was noteworthy for how little lightning it generated. Friday night, the normal warning cues of a potentially severe storm \u2014 including the strobe-like effect of lightning and thunder \u2014 were largely absent.\n\nThe sudden arrival of torrential rain, strong wind gusts and tornadoes, but without lightning, puts forecasters in a conundrum. Typically, one does not issue a severe thunderstorm warning for these conditions.\n\n\u201cIt evolved very quickly,\u201d Strong said. \u201cIt turned from a fairly benign rain event into a pretty intense QLCS event.\"\n\nWhile the Weather Service tries to provide as much warning time as possible, Strong said tornadoes along these lines \u201cinvariably develop very quickly and fall apart very quickly.\u201d\n\nA special type of cold season squall line\n\nDuring the cold season (October-March), a sub-variety of QLCS called a high shear, low CAPE (convective available potential energy) storm can sometimes occur in the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic. It was this type of squall line that swept through central Maryland on Friday evening.\n\n\u201cHigh shear\u201d refers to the environmental winds in the atmosphere, which increase in speed with altitude. When the difference in winds over the lowest four miles reaches 40 to 50 mph, conditions become ripe for supercell thunderstorms. The wind shear value Friday evening was an astounding 70 mph.\n\nBut supercells did not develop, because the atmosphere was not unstable enough. An unstable atmosphere is one in which there is plenty of warm, buoyant air that rises to great depth. We measure the total buoyancy of air using the CAPE parameter, and values over 1,000 are generally needed to support thunderstorms. Severe thunderstorms become more likely with values over 2,000. Friday evening\u2019s CAPE was just 200-300.\n\nWhile these storm cells lacked updrafts driven by buoyant, unstable air, impressively strong dynamics in the middle and upper atmosphere helped to compensate. An amplifying wave of low pressure aloft (called a shortwave trough) in the jet stream caused air to rise vigorously over the region.\n\nAir was also being lifted along a narrow zone ahead of a cold front, as shown below. An intensifying region of low pressure had formed along this front hours earlier and was tracking into the D.C. area during tornado time. Air converging into the low pressure area helped create further uplift of moist air.\n\n\n\nSurface weather map for Friday evening, showing low pressure and cold front. NOAA, annotated by author. (NOAA)\n\nThe exceptionally strong wind shear, combined with vigorously rising air, set the stage for small regions of mid-level rotation to develop. These small vortices are called mesocyclones, and they initiated within portions of the QLCS line. These small vortices distort the shape of the line into a wavelike appearance.\n\nAdditionally, there was significant directional change in the winds with altitude, called veering of the winds, meaning they turn clockwise with altitude. Veering winds amp up the potential for tornado formation within preexisting small zones of spin. The surface low pressure system enhanced the turning of wind, from southeasterly at the ground, to southwesterly higher up in the atmosphere.\n\nWhat we lacked in terms of instability was compensated by a combination of wind shear and low pressure. Had we experienced CAPEs in the range of 1,500-2,000, the outcome could very well have been a much larger tornado outbreak across the region.\n\nThe Mount Airy and Baltimore tornadoes in focus\n\nThe image below shows the radar structure over Mount Airy. As the left panel shows, there is no hook echo so typical of a supercell thunderstorm. Instead, there are numerous lobes of heavy rain, with clefts between the lobes. Mount Airy is near a particularly deep notch or indentation, where low-level winds stream into a mesocyclone.\n\n\n\nRadar image showing rain intensity (left) and Doppler velocity (right) over Mount Airy on Friday evening. RadarScope.com, annotated by author. (RadarScope.com)\n\nThat mesocyclone (embedded in heavy rain) is depicted in the right panel, which shows Doppler wind speeds at low levels in the cloud. Orange colors show fast flow from the southwest, green shading from the northeast. The strong directional change, which is counterclockwise, is termed a velocity couplet and identifies the parent mesocyclone responsible for spawning the Mount Airy tornado.\n\nThe next image below shows the same radar signatures in the vicinity of Baltimore and Dundalk during that tornado. The undulating characteristic is less apparent (left panel), but there is an intense convective cell (small purple region) just north of Dundalk, perhaps indicative of small hail and, thus, a robust storm updraft.\n\n\n\nRadar image showing rain intensity (left) and Doppler velocity (right) over Dundalk on Friday evening. RadarScope.com, annotated by author. (RadarScope.com)\n\nThe Doppler velocity couplet is much larger and more diffuse, compared with Mount Airy \u2014 which would have made it even a trickier call as to whether issue a tornado warning. This may be due to the longer distance between Dundalk and the radar (near Dulles Airport), a factor that tends to smear out the details of these subtle areas of spin in the air.\n\nCapital Weather Gang\u2019s Ian Livingston contributed to this post.", "\n\nSaudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman speaks during the Future Investment Initiative Forum in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on Oct. 24, 2018.

Bezos is the founder and chief executive of Amazon.\n\nSome of the tweets justified a boycott by saying that Saudi Arabia and its crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, are under attack.\n\nI was premier customer as I ordered weekly from Amazon, but now I delete my account until they stop attacking my government .#\u0645\u0642\u0627\u0637\u0639\u0647_\u0627\u0645\u0627\u0632\u0648\u0646_\u0648\u0633\u0648\u0642_\u062f\u0648\u062a_\u0643\u0648\u0645 \u2014 MBS\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\udde6Nonni (@nonni909) November 5, 2018\n\nKhashoggi, once a Riyadh insider, had become a trenchant critic of the crown prince\u2019s reforms in recent years and lived in Virginia in self-imposed exile. He was killed Oct. 2 after visiting the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul to get a document he needed for his planned marriage.\n\nThe journalist\u2019s disappearance \u2014 and the kingdom\u2019s belated admission that he was killed at the consulate \u2014 caused a global publicity crisis for Saudi Arabia and Mohammed. Riyadh has repeatedly denied that the crown prince had any knowledge of a plan to kill Khashoggi, but many observers find that claim unlikely.\n\nStill, many Saudis still support Mohammed: \u201cWhat happened to Khashoggi is terrible and goes against Islam,\" one Saudi citizen in the town of Ad Dilam said to The Post last week. \"Our crown prince did not do that. We trust him, and we feel the changes he has made for us.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how much the Amazon boycott drive represents popular opinion in Saudi Arabia. The country has one of the most active Twitter user bases in the Arab world, but analysts say the use of pro-government bots is widespread and often designed to get certain messages onto trending lists.\n\nMany of the tweets calling for a boycott of Amazon used similar if not identical language, suggesting some degree of coordination. Some users also used the hashtags to criticize the call for boycott, saying it would not make a difference.\n\n#\u0645\u0642\u0627\u0637\u0639\u0647_\u0627\u0645\u0627\u0632\u0648\u0646_\u0648\u0633\u0648\u0642_\u062f\u0648\u062a_\u0643\u0648\u0645 who ever created this hashtag clearly knows nothin about world economics, you really think not buying headphone with ur 20 riyals would bring Jeff bezos to his knees! \u2014 Dr. Hamoud Somaily (@HamoudSomaily) November 5, 2018\n\nAmazon had been looking toward Saudi Arabia as an area of potential growth. The retailer began hiring for new positions in Riyadh this year after Bezos met with Mohammed in Seattle in March. It also used Souq, which is widely used in Saudi Arabia, to offer access to Amazon.\n\nA representative from Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Post.\n\nRead more:\n\nOne month after Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s killing, these key questions remain unanswered\n\nTo shame a prince, activists want to rename street in front of Saudi embassy in D.C. \u2018Jamal Khashoggi Way\u2019\n\nTrump and the Saudis keep fumbling after Khashoggi\u2019s killing", "MEXICO CITY \u2014 Mexico has tightened laws dictating that public servants can\u2019t earn more than the president and eliminated so-called golden parachutes for elected officials.\n\nLawmakers decreed via the official gazette Monday that there will be some exceptions for salaries of employees with high levels of specialization and technical expertise, but even those salaries will be capped at 50 percent more than the president\u2019s salary.\n\nPresident-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador takes office Dec. 1 and has said he will pay himself 108,000 pesos ($5,400) a month.

Thousands of Iranians rallied in Tehran on Sunday to mark the anniversary as Washington restored all sanctions lifted under the nuclear deal. (Vahid Salemi/Associated Press)\n\nTEHRAN, Iran \u2014 Iranians already struggling to get by amid spiraling prices fear even more hardship is on the way with Monday\u2019s restoration of crippling U.S. sanctions.\n\nAt a Tehran pharmacy, customers said medicines were already getting further out of reach. Manijeh Khorrami, who had come to buy tablets for his diabetic mother, said the Iranian-made version\u2019s price had tripled since the summer and the foreign version was no longer available.\n\n\u201cCan it get worse than the current situation?\u201d Khorrami said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what will happen.\u201d\n\nThe new sanctions end all economic benefits America had granted Tehran for its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, though Iran continues to abide by the accord, which requires it to curb its uranium enrichment. President Donald Trump withdrew from the accord in May, saying it did not address Iran\u2019s regional military activities and other issues.\n\nIran\u2019s national currency, the rial, has plummeted for months and is now trading at 150,000 to one U.S. dollar, compared to around 40,500 a year ago. The new sanctions will likely undermine the rial even more since they target Iran\u2019s oil industry, a crucial source of hard currency. They also target dozens of Iranian banks, aiming to push the financial sector deeper into isolation.\n\nThe result has been skyrocketing prices for everything from clothes and transportation to food.\n\n\u201cCheck the shops here one by one, there are no customers,\u201d said Hossein Ahmadi, whose purse shop is located on a normally busy commercial street in the Iranian capital. \u201cPeople have kept their money for rainy days out of fear of sanctions while rent of the shop has gone up.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how to explain this to my wife and children,\u201d he said.\n\nAt nearby clothes shops, a few women looked through the scarves and coats.\n\n\u201cA lot of people are not able to buy these things anymore,\u201d said one 22-year-old shopper, Mina Sholeh.\n\nWashington has issued a list of 12 demands Iran must meet to get the sanctions lifted, including ending its support for regional militant groups, withdrawing from the civil war in Syria \u2014 where it backs President Bashar Assad \u2014 and halting its development of ballistic missiles. On Friday, Trump said the objective is \u201cto force the regime into a clear choice: either abandon its destructive behavior or continue down the path toward economic disaster.\u201d\n\nIn large part, the bet is that Iran\u2019s leadership will be pressured by public outrage. Iran\u2019s economic chaos sparked anti-government protests at the end of last year which resulted in nearly 5,000 reported arrests and at least 25 people being killed. At the time, the Trump administration cheered the protests.\n\nDemonstrations have become sporadic and rare. But bitterness remains among many Iranians who complain about corruption and their government\u2019s costly interventions in Syria and Iraq.\n\n\u201cThe government is wealthy, it sells oil abroad but it does not care about ordinary people,\u201d said Mohammad Ghasemi, who sells scarves on a street corner. \u201cThey waste money where it does nothing to cure the wounds in our heart.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Mark Ralston/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe lead-up to Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections in the United States has been marred by violence.\n\nCesar Sayoc, 56, of Aventura, Fla., is accused of mailing at least a dozen pipe bombs to President Trump\u2019s political foes, including top Democratic leaders, as well as to CNN. Gregory Bush, 51, of Louisville, is charged with fatally shooting two black shoppers at a grocery store in Kentucky after failing in his plan to gun down black worshipers at a church. Police say Robert D. Bowers, 46, of Pittsburgh, opened fire at a synagogue in the city, killing 11. He was described as a virulent anti-Semite who blamed the Hebrew International Aid Society for helping refugees resettle in the United States.\n\nThese incidents \u2014 some of which were overtly political \u2014 have voters on edge. Could they impact the results of the election?\n\nResearchers have tried in the past to answer that question by untangling the relationship between political violence and elections.\n\nIn one study, researchers set out to understand how violence effects democracy in Africa. The team studied 300 elections held in sub-Saharan Africa from 1990 to 2014 and found that election-related violence took place about half the time. In most cases, the violence amounted to harassment and intimidation of voters and candidates. About a third of the time, it took the form of political assassinations. In nearly every case, the violence occurred before the election, as it has this year in the United States.\n\nThe researchers thought turnout would drop if voters feared for their safety, but they found that wasn\u2019t the case. \u201cAt first glance, our finding doesn\u2019t make sense. Coercion and intimidation should scare voters away from elections that they fear will turn violent,\u201d they wrote in a Washington Post article. Yet the results showed that \"there\u2019s really no systemic difference in turnout between elections where campaigning was peaceful and elections where violence took place.\u201d\n\n\u201cOpposition supporters who are afraid of election violence actually tend to report higher levels of intention to vote in future elections than those who are not afraid of violence,\u201d wrote one of the researchers, Stephanie M. Burchard, in an email to The Post. \u201cIn the case of self-identified \u2018independent\u2019 voters who fear election violence, they also tend to more often state that they will vote in the future and will choose the party they believe NOT responsible for violence. Ultimately, I believe that violence can increase the resolve of opposition supporters and independents and \u2018persuade' some voters to punish those they believe behind the violence, usually the ruling party.\u201d\n\nDavid Muchlinski, a political science professor at Georgia Tech, offered a parallel to the Philippines, where local militias are either hired directly or encouraged by politicians to attack their opponents around election time. In the United States, Muchlinski said, extremists are being egged on by Trump and the Republican Party.\n\nBut that\u2019s where the similarities end.\n\n\u201cThe line between legitimate politics and violence in a country like the Philippines is blurred almost so it doesn\u2019t really sort of exist,\u201d Muchlinksi said. That\u2019s not the case here, he said \u2014 at least not yet. \"The United States has a problem, but it has not yet crossed the Rubicon where violence has become intertwined with legitimate politics,\u201d he said.\n\nSarah Birch, founder of the Electoral Violence Project, added that the reaction to pre-election violence in the United States is usually one of unity, not calls for more conflict. \u201cAfter unusual violence, you often see people rallying behind demands for peace to make sure nothing happens again,\" she said.\n\nUltimately, it can be hard for a regime to predict what impact violence might have. Other kinds of electoral manipulation \u2014 stuffing ballot boxes, submitting phantom ballots, paying people to vote a certain way \u2014 are often much more reliable.\n\nViolence is \u201cnot a last-ditch effort, exactly,\" Muchlinski said. \u201cBut it\u2019s the most costly. Regimes will use violence only when they\u2019re relatively sure that other methods of altering the vote won\u2019t work.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nThis midterm election is like no other in a generation\n\nTrump administration prepares for massive shake-up after midterms\n\nU.S. midterms: Will there be a youth wave?

(Courtesy Blizzard)\n\nThe success enjoyed by the wildly popular digital card game \u201cHearthstone\u201d was not apparent upon its inception. Despite a fervent launch, bolstered by the attached Warcraft brand, the game has had its share of growing pains, amplified by forging a path where there was none. But now that trail has led the game to a new, notable milestone: 100 million users.\n\nCreated in a lab by a small team within Blizzard Entertainment, the game is a phenomenon in a relatively niche genre, the product of forward thinking at the outset and balancing difficult decisions throughout a never ending process of revision and refinement. Now it stands as the presumptive king of digital cards, complete with a thriving esports circuit, and enjoys a massive audience at a time when other beloved card games are hoping to join the fray.\n\n\u201c[The \u2018Hearthstone\u2019 team] went through some challenging times when they were developing it,\u201d Hearthstone senior VP and executive producer Chris Sigaty said, noting there was some question internally about the game\u2019s development. \u201c\u2018Is this really at the level of a Blizzard thing?\u2019, initially, when they were making Hearthstone. And right from the moment I touched it, [I knew] this was gonna be brilliant and I was certainly gonna love it, and it turned out to be so.\u201d\n\nDevelopment started on '\u201dHearthstone\" in 2008 under the code name Project Pegasus, though it would be six years until its release in 2014. Former '\u201dHearthstone\" production director Jason Chayes said the team focused on a few key tenets in those early years: charm and accessibility.\n\nPlayed on a computer, tablet, or smartphone, \u201cHearthstone\u201d players build decks around one of nine hero classes and battle in head-to-head card duels, trying to reduce their opponent\u2019s life points to zero using minions and spells. Matches are short and intense, just brisk enough for coffee breaks or waiting on the laundry. The aesthetic of the game drives home the casual-competitive atmosphere, set in a fireside tavern amid mugs of ale and cheers from an off-screen audience.\n\n[For JuJu Smith-Schuster, streaming is a passion, and perhaps a post-NFL career path]\n\nDecks are filled using cards earned by playing the game\u2019s many modes or buying packs, with either accrued in-game currency or real-world money. It\u2019s that component that has made the game such a lucrative property for Blizzard, but also vulnerable to criticism from players who feel their investment, in terms of time, money or both, is not being properly rewarded.\n\nThe development team said Blizzard has worked throughout the years to make sure packs \u201cfeel like a good value.\u201d Some features, like preventing players from finding duplicate legendary (the highest rarity) cards from a set in packs, are designed specifically to alleviate frustrations. Those features are unique to the digital space, fixing a problem experienced by anyone who has collected physical cards.\n\n\n\nThe Hearthstone development team poses for a group photo in 2013. (Courtesy Blizzard)\n\nFrom the beginning the \u201cHearthstone\u201d built the game with a digital-first mind-set, breaking from the limitations of traditional, tabletop card games. Corporeal titans like Magic The Gathering and the Pok\u00e9mon trading card game were successful, but their digital versions tried to approximate the \u201creal thing.\u201d \u201cHearthstone\u201d was made for screens, which allowed for certain freedoms.\n\n\u201cSo when you're playing a \u2018fireball\u2019 card in a physical card game, that's usually when you extend the card to your opponent to see and say, \u2018I deal five damage to your minion here or you as a hero,\u2019\u201d said Ben Thompson, creative director for the game. \u201cAnd that's not near as compelling as playing the card and a gigantic five-damage or 10-damage fireball manifesting over the board, changing the lighting and swooping down for an explosive impact on your hero. That is something you only get to do in a digital space.\u201d\n\nThe game\u2019s simplicity and accessibility is another key factor cited in growing the game\u2019s popularity. \u201cHearthstone\u201d content creator and player Octavian \u201cKripparrian\u201d Morosan believes the clear presentation was appealing to the game\u2019s viewers.\n\n\u201cIt's very easy to understand what's happening, where you are in any game, and it's very easy to develop your own opinion about the direction that the active player should take,\u201d said Morosan. \u201cIt's just an extremely engaging game that's very easy to understand and watch, and that has a big impact on the different places of viewership, YouTube, Twitch.\u201d\n\n['Red Dead Redemption 2' is jaw-dropping on every level]\n\nTwitch is home to hundreds of live streams, and \u201cHearthstone\u201d has seen huge success on the platform broadcasting international tournaments and collegiate competitions. Twitch analytics site Sullygnome puts '\u201dHearthstone\" seventh among gaming titles in average viewers on Twitch in the last year, with over 377 million hours viewed. (Note: Twitch is owned by Amazon, whose CEO, Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\n\n\n\nConcept drawings for Hearthstone. (Courtesy Blizzard)\n\nChe Chou, franchise lead for \u201cHearthstone\u201d esports, echoed the open and accessible refrain when asked how the game\u2019s competitive circuit has helped the title develop its overall audience. As Chou puts it, \u201cThere\u2019s no reason an 80-year-old can\u2019t be playing an 18-year-old on the stage.\u201d\n\n\u201cHearthstone\u2019s\u201d path to 100 million users has not been without stumbles, though. Balancing a living game over the years gets more challenging with each new batch of cards players can use. Chayes specifically recalled one mechanic dubbed \u201cCharge,\u201d which lets minions attack when they\u2019re played rather than waiting a turn, as a specific point of tension. Most minions have to wait a turn, to allow the other player time to react or prepare, but Charge lets the player let loose right away, a frustrating occurrence for those enduring the surprise attack.\n\nOne card, \u201cWarsong Commander,\u201d seemed strong but innocuous in the early days of \u201cHearthstone.\u201d It\u2019s an unassuming minion by itself, but it had a critical bit of text that gave other minions on the board Charge. Dropping powerful minions with huge numbers alongside the Commander let players get around the one-turn wait and go right for the kill.\n\nThe card text was adjusted to \u201cwhenever you summon a minion with three or less Attack, give it Charge,\u201d but 2015\u2019s expansion \u201cBlackrock Mountain\u201d saw the card rise up again, this time due to the prevalence of Grim Patron, a low-statistics minion that spawned a copy of itself every time it took damage and survived. Warrior players could summon a horde of Patrons using self-damage spells, give them Charge with the Commander, then slam the opponent for tons of damage. There was a predictable outcry from the community.\n\nThe team went back to the drawing board, producing \u201c30 to 40\u201d iterations before settling on the Commander as it is today: \u201cYour Charge minions have +1 Attack.\u201d\n\nEven from the beginning, the team was dealing with different design choices that would require a lot of forethought, as new expansions could reveal more holes. The Priest class, for example, was going to be able to openly steal cards from the opponent\u2019s deck, but the team soon realized that theft didn\u2019t feel good for both players, and turned it into copying cards instead.\n\n\n\nThe then-top secret logo for Project Pegasus, the working title for Hearthstone. (Courtesy Blizzard)\n\n\u201cThey still have those cards, they still get to use them as they were planning to when they built that deck,\u201d said Thompson. \u201cBut it doesn't completely undercut the next 10 minutes of their gameplay because you took a hinge point or pivotal card from [the opponent\u2019s] deck, thereby neutering it.\u201d\n\nSince it\u2019s a digital game, problems can be retroactively adjusted, though that\u2019s a last-ditch option according to the team. Instead they try to iterate with new cards, and use a standardized format for decks to keep the competitive circuit level.\n\nThe team behind 'Hearthstone\u2019 has also seen turnover. Game director Ben Brode had been the public face of the 'Hearthstone\u2019 team, and his departure in April was a noticeable shift. But Sigaty said the change was not as stark as you might think.\n\n\u201cThe reality of it is, there is no one person that defines a product here,\u201d said Sigaty. \u201cIt's always the team that's doing it, and the team has made amazing sets and cards, and made great decisions about things in the absence of folks like Ben and [Hamilton Chu], and they will continue to do so, because it really is about the sum total of the team.\u201d\n\nNow that it has reached this new milestone \u201cHearthstone\u2019s\u201d position atop the card gaming community will be tested anew. More digital card games have been popping up, and even some industry titans are joining in. Wizards of the Coast just launched Magic The Gathering Arena, and Valve is releasing its Dota card game, Artifact, later this month.\n\nBut the \u2018Hearthstone\u2019 team seems to welcome the challenge.\n\n\u201cThe way Blizzard makes games has never been from a perspective of being the first or the only game in the genre,\u201d said Thompson. \u201cI think that our intent has always been to be the best one we can make for a genre, and I think 'Hearthstone\u2019 will continue to prove that out as we become part of an even bigger and bigger genre that we, thankfully, have had such a big part in creating, to the level it is today.\u201d\n\nEric Van Allen is a freelance writer from Texas who covers games and esports.\n\nRead more from The Post:\n\n\u2018Fallout 76\u2019 is the multiplayer game that actually feels lonely.

The law allowed slave holders to keep their slaves for a maximum of three years. After the grace period, all black people \u2014 those considered freed or enslaved \u2014 were required to leave Oregon Country. Black women were given three years to get out; black men were required to leave in two.\n\nThe law became known as the \u201cPeter Burnett Lash Law.\u201d Burnett, who also opposed Chinese migration to Oregon Country, would later become the first American governor of California.\n\nThe \u201cLash Law\u201d was quickly amended and then repealed. No black people were ever lashed under the law.\n\nBut the act would become the first of three \u201cexclusion laws\u201d that shaped the Pacific Northwest, banning any additional black people from coming to Oregon Country. Those laws created what one African American professor calls \u201ca very hostile environment\u201d that has long made Oregon and its largest city, Portland, a stronghold for white supremacists like Jeremy Joseph Christian, the man accused of killing two men and severely wounding another on a light-rail train last month.\n\nFew people are aware of Oregon\u2019s history of blatant racism, including its refusal to ratify the 14th and 15th Amendments of the Constitution.\n\n[Hunting down runaway slaves: The cruel ads of Andrew Jackson and \u2018the master class\u2019]\n\nIn 1848, the territorial government passed a law making it illegal for any \u201cNegro or Mullatto\u201d to live in Oregon Country. In 1850, under the Oregon Donation Land Act, \u201cwhites and half breed Indians\u201d were granted 650 acres of land from the government. But any other person of color was excluded from claiming land in Oregon. In 1851, Jacob Vanderpool, the black owner of a saloon, restaurant and boarding home, was actually expelled from Oregon territory.\n\n\u201cThe exclusion laws were primarily intended to prevent blacks from settling in Oregon, not to kick out those who were already here,\u201d according to Salem Public Library records. But Vanderpool\u2019s neighbor \u201creported him for the crime of being black in Oregon, and Judge Thomas Nelson gave him thirty days to leave the territory.\u201d\n\nThe Oregon constitution excluded blacks.\n\nIn 1857, as Oregon sought to become a state, it wrote the exclusion of blacks into its constitution: \u201cNo free negro or mulatto, not residing in this State at the time of the adoption of this constitution, shall ever come, reside, or be within this State, or hold any real estate, or make any contract, or maintain any suit therein; and the Legislative Assembly shall provide by penal laws for the removal by public officers of all such free negroes and mulattoes, and for their effectual exclusion from the State, and for the punishment of persons who shall bring them into the State, or employ or harbor them therein.\u201d\n\nWhen Oregon entered the Union in 1859 \u2014 it did so as a \u201cwhites-only\u201d state. The original state constitution banned slavery, but also excluded nonwhites from living there.\n\n\u201cOregon is the only state in the United States that actually began as literally whites-only,\u201d said Winston Grady-Willis, director of Portland State University\u2019s School of Gender, Race and Nations. \u201cEven though there was subsequent legislation that challenged those statutes, the statutes were not removed from the books until 1922.\u201d\n\nGrady-Willis added: \u201cIt\u2019s really important for folks to understand this notion of Oregon as this lily-white state sets the tone and is important structurally for the remainder of history of not only the state, but cities like Portland as well.\u201d\n\n[\u2018Life or death for black travelers\u2019: How fear led to \u2018The Negro Motorist Green-Book\u2019]\n\nPortland\u2019s reputation as a progressive city is largely a myth, he said. Portland remains the whitest, large city in United States. According to a July 2015 Census report, the city of 612,206 people, was 77.6 percent white; and 5.8 percent black. Grady-Willis called it \u201ca key site for Klan activity.\u201d\n\nThis is the historical backdrop for the charges against Christian, 35, who allegedly verbally abused two women on the train, including one wearing a hijab, and then attacked the men who came to their aid.\n\nDuring a brief court hearing Tuesday, Christian was unapologetic:\n\n\u201cYou call it terrorism,\u201d Christian said in court. \u201cI call it patriotism.\u201d\n\nThe man accused of murdering two men who tried to stop him from shouting religious slurs on a Portland train, appeared in court on May 30. Jeremy Christian shouted \"free speech or die, Portland\" during his arraignment. (Reuters)\n\nOregon has a defiant history of resisting federal laws that gave black people rights.\n\nKaren Gibson, associate professor in Portland State\u2019s Toulan School of Urban Studies and Planning, said Oregon rescinded its initial ratification of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which granted citizenship to \u201call persons born or naturalized in the United States,\u201d including former slaves.\n\nOregon was one of just six states that refused to ratify the 15th Amendment, which gave black men the right to vote.\n\nOregon did not ratify the 15th amendment until 1959 \u2014 one hundred years after the state joined the Union. It was a symbolic adoption as part of its centennial celebration. It did not re-ratify the 14th amendment until 1973.\n\n\u201cMany of the white settlers who came here came for the Oregon Land Donation Act. This place was intentionally settled by whites for whites,\u201d Gibson said.\n\n\u201cThey did not want slavery here. They didn\u2019t want land taken over by large plantations so they didn\u2019t have to compete with bonded labor. But they also thought blacks were inferior. That is still here. White supremacy is about that: the beliefs that whites were supreme.\u201d\n\nDarrell Millner, professor emeritus in Portland State\u2019s Black Studies Department, said many early Oregon settlers were opposed to slavery \u201cnot because of what it did to blacks but because of what it did to them. Slavery represented a competition they did not wish to work against.\u201d\n\nMillner said Oregon became a place where \u201cmany practices we associate with the Jim Crow South were legal here.\u201d In the 1920s, Oregon had the largest Ku Klux Klan organization west of the Mississippi River. In 1922, Walter Pierce, a member of the Ku Klux Klan, was elected governor of Oregon. Pierce served as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from 1932 to 1942.\n\n\n\nMeeting of the KKK, probably in Portland, Ore., in the 1920s.

Mulugeta Seraw was a student at Portland State University. He was killed by three white supremacists who were members of the White Aryan Resistance who beat him with a baseball bat.\n\nIn 1990, the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Anti-Defamation League won a lawsuit against the White Aryan Resistance on behalf of Seraw\u2019s family.\n\nMillner said he has lived in Oregon 47 years. When he heard about the stabbings on the train last month he said he was disturbed but not surprised.\n\n\u201cIt reinforced the subterranean awareness all people of color in Oregon have that something like that could happen to them at any time and in place,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is reflective of what people of color in Oregon live with.

If you can\u2019t remember and you happen to be the president of the United States, look twice.\n\nSince the start of 2012, you see, Venezuela\u2019s government has forced its central bank to print so much money that its currency, going by black market rates, has lost 99.9999 percent of its value. In the meantime, the regime\u2019s response has been to lop five zeros off all their money in an attempt to pretend things aren\u2019t as bad as they are. Which, of course, doesn\u2019t solve anything. It\u2019s like trying to lose weight by changing your clothes. It might make you feel better about yourself for a little while, but it\u2019s no substitute for the real solution: not printing any more money.\n\nThis, as you can probably tell, is pretty much the worst-case scenario for what can happen when politicians are allowed to make monetary policy decisions. Indeed, it has gotten to the point that the International Monetary Fund has all but admitted that it has no idea how much higher Venezuela\u2019s inflation will go. That\u2019s what increasing your estimate of it from 12,000 percent to 1 million percent is really saying. Well, that and the fact that this is probably the worst inflation the world has seen since Zimbabwe was reduced to printing 100 trillion dollar bills a decade ago.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to reach wheelbarrows-full-of-cash levels of inflation, though, for political meddling in central bank decisions to be a problem. Double-digit inflation is more than bad enough, and it can take only a little interference to get there. That\u2019s something we\u2019ve learned firsthand. The stagflation of the 1970s, after all, was in no small part a result of the way President Richard Nixon bullied the Fed into keeping interest rates inappropriately low during his reelection campaign.\n\nThe simple story, then, is that it\u2019s better for central banks to be independent, because easier money is always in a politician\u2019s short-term interest, but isn\u2019t always in the economy\u2019s long-term one\n\nThis brings us to President Trump\u2019s latest commentary on monetary policy. He actually has a pretty strong argument when he says that the Fed shouldn\u2019t be raising rates at even the moderate pace it has been until inflation starts going up more itself. The reason is that it\u2019s a lot easier to deal with prices that are rising too quickly than it is to deal with an economy that\u2019s not growing quickly enough when interest rates are as low as they are. He\u2019s just making this argument in the worst way possible, making not-so-veiled threats about how he\u2019s \u201cvery unhappy with the Fed,\u201d thinks that it\u2019s independent only \u201cin theory,\u201d and that he \u201cshould be given some help\u201d by it.\n\nNow, in case you think this is merely a quasi-academic disagreement about the proper pace of rate increases, Trump also reportedly wanted the Fed to print money to cover the United States' now-expanding deficit. Which, as we said before, is exactly what Venezuela did to destroy its currency. It\u2019s as though Trump were pouring water onto the metaphorical slope of criticizing the Fed to make sure we didn\u2019t miss just how slippery it really is.\n\nThis story wouldn\u2019t be complete, though, without this final bit of irony: Trump has spent the past few weeks on the campaign trail accusing Democrats of wanting to \u201cturn America into Venezuela.\u201d At least we can say he has some familiarity with the subject.", "Opinion writer\n\nThis election has seen some surprises and some things that were absolutely predictable. Few of us would have imagined that Republicans could think they\u2019d be able to get away with suddenly proclaiming themselves the true champions of protections for people with preexisting conditions, for instance. But centering their campaign on racist appeals to fear and hatred? I think we all saw that coming.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s going to work, though we won\u2019t know for sure until Tuesday night. But it does raise a question that will help determine the shape of our politics for the next few years: What happens afterward? Especially if they lose the House \u2014 as pretty much everyone assumes they will \u2014 will Republicans conclude that the campaign they ran was a mistake and try to change?\n\nI don\u2019t mean that they\u2019ll conclude it was a moral mistake, because they\u2019ve proved time and again that as a group they really have no moral principles they aren\u2019t willing to transgress if it means winning the next battle. You\u2019d think that when the former grand wizard of the KKK is applauding the president for his racist campaign ads and white supremacist websites are lighting up with joy over his rhetoric, it might lead to some reflection on the right. But we know it won\u2019t.\n\nSo if nothing else, if they\u2019re not successful in holding the House, Republicans could decide that it was a tactical mistake to embrace race-baiting as a campaign strategy. And I\u2019m sure some will. The problem is that the party as a whole may be trapped into repeating the same strategy for the next couple of elections.\n\nThat might seem counter-intuitive. After all, if they lose, wouldn\u2019t they want to change? That\u2019s the view Matt Viser describes here:\n\nBy running so overtly on racially tinged messages, the GOP is putting that explosive form of politics on the ballot. If Republicans maintain control of the House, the notion of running a campaign built on blunt, race-based attacks on immigrants and minorities will have been validated. A loss, on the other hand, might prompt a number of Republicans to call for a rethinking of the party\u2019s direction \u2014 but that would collide with a sitting president who, if anything, relishes over-the-edge rhetoric.\n\nThat seems to make perfect sense, and there are many Republicans running right now, particularly in suburban districts, who wish the president would dial down the racism so they could just appeal to traditional party loyalties and assure voters they\u2019re reasonable and responsible. But this is Trump\u2019s party, and if you have an \u201cR\u201d next to your name, you\u2019re going to own whatever he does. There will be some Republicans saying the party made a mistake, but their arguments will fall on deaf ears.\n\nLet\u2019s consider what will happen to the GOP after this election is over. Democrats are definitely going to pick up seats in the House; we just don\u2019t know yet whether the number will be 20, 30, 40 or more. What we do know is that the Republicans who lose will be the more moderate members. While there are a few exceptions here and there, as a general matter, the more conservative a district is, the safer the seat and the more intensely right-wing its member of Congress.\n\nThat means that your ordinary Freedom Caucus member is going to get reelected even in a blue wave, while the vulnerable members are the more moderate ones who represent swing districts. This will produce a somewhat ironic result in the next Congress: The bigger the blue wave, the more conservative the Republican caucus will end up being when it\u2019s over, and the less equipped the GOP will be to run a different kind of campaign in 2020.\n\nIf all the reporting and polls are wrong, we\u2019ll end up with a Republican Congress that looks like it does now (which, to be clear, is incredibly conservative). On the other hand, if Democrats get just enough seats to take the House, a couple dozen of the more moderate Republicans will be defeated, shifting the center of the caucus that remains to the right. And if there\u2019s a huge blue wave, every Republican with even the slightest impulse toward moderation will be gone.\n\nSo imagine that happens, and as we approach 2020, all the GOP voices in the House (and nearly all in the Senate) are concerned about appealing to conservative districts and states where they fear only a primary challenge from the right. Not only that, President Trump is running his own reelection campaign, one that will be built on the same racist and xenophobic appeals that helped him get elected in 2016 and that he\u2019s pressing now.\n\nWe know that\u2019s what Trump will do, not only because it\u2019s who he is but also because he clearly believes its the best strategy to win. If Democrats win a huge victory Tuesday, Trump isn\u2019t going to say, \u201cGee, I guess I was wrong about all that anti-immigrant stuff. I need to reach out to a broader electorate to get reelected.\u201d He\u2019ll tell himself that the 2018 defeat only happened because he was not personally on the ballot, and it would have been much worse had he not executed such a brilliant strategy.\n\nThat story line will also be validated by the conservative media. Feeding the racial fears and resentments of older white people is to Fox News and conservative radio hosts such as Rush Limbaugh what game highlights are to ESPN. It\u2019s the core of the business model, and has been for a couple of decades now. And the GOP base \u2014 aghast at an unprecedented number of victories by Democratic women and people of color \u2014 will become even more susceptible to the message of fear.\n\nYou can extend it out even further. What happens in 2022? If Trump wins in 2020, it will validate the race-baiting, and if he loses it means there will be a Democratic president and a right-wing backlash a la the tea party. The earliest we could see the GOP truly try to reach out to a broader swath of voters is 2024.\n\nAnd this year, they\u2019re going to come to the same set of conclusions whether they win or lose. Was the racist fear-mongering a mistake? Nope, midterm losses just happen to the president\u2019s party. Was it wrong to try to suppress the votes of racial minorities in places such as Georgia and North Dakota? Nope, we just didn\u2019t do a thorough enough job of it. Should we try something different? We might like to, but as long as Trump is president, this is the strategy we\u2019re going to follow.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot more ugliness to come.\n\nRead more:\n\nBrian Klaas: A reminder: America\u2019s future is at stake in the 2018 midterms\n\nHugh Hewitt: Republicans and Democrats have very different closing arguments.

That\u2019s what Peter Roskam voted for.'\u201d Roskam, a six-term Republican, is in deep trouble like fellow Chicago suburban Republican, Rep. Randy Hultgren.\n\nBen Jacobs from the Guardian writes:\n\nIn suburban districts across the US, politics as usual has been turned on its head. Nowhere is this more so than in two districts outside Chicago that were long represented by Republican stalwarts such as Henry Hyde and Dennis Hastert. Among the prosperous and well-educated suburbanites who once made up its base, the GOP is facing rejection. Roskam has long been aware of the threat. A former member of House Republican leadership who helped write the 2017 tax cut bill, he represents Illinois\u2019 sixth district. It is one of the wealthiest districts in the country. In 2016, Hillary Clinton won it by seven points. In 2012, Mitt Romney won it by even more.\n\nWell, if Roskam was afraid of the threat, he sure didn\u2019t do much about it. He could have voted against the Obamacare repeal or revised the tax cut to focus more on the middle- and working-class suburbs. He could have pushed to a vote on a broadly popular bipartisan immigration bill. Instead of tiptoeing around the issues or merely inching away from Trump rhetorically now and then, Roskam could have condemned the party\u2019s turn to nativism and climate change denial. He could have pushed for gun safety legislation. (The Post reports that throughout the country, \u201cDemocratic congressional candidates in suburban swing seats are embracing restrictions on firearms as election-related spending from pro-gun groups, including the powerhouse National Rifle Association, has plummeted. . . . The candidates\u2019 emboldened approach, combined with the changes in spending trends, reflects a shift in the politics of gun policy over the past two years.\u201d) Republicans such as Roskam who tried to walk the tightrope between their constituents and the Trump base now face defeat.\n\nWhen the pundits declare that Trump and the GOP are \u201cgetting away\u201d with something (e.g., lying, ignoring science, fearmongering), the talking heads on TV assume that the Roskams and Hultgrens will pay no penalty for the GOP\u2019s descent into irrationality, bigotry and meanness. If the GOP is \u201cgetting away with it,\u201d however, Republicans such as Rep. Barbara Comstock (R-Va.) in Virginia\u2019s 10th (the D.C. suburbs), Rep. Kevin Yoder (R-Kan.) whose 3rd Congressional District is in the suburbs of Kansas City, and a flock of Republicans in Pennsylvania and New Jersey suburbs wouldn\u2019t be looking at a political wipeout on Tuesday.\n\nMcClatchy reports:\n\nFrom Charlotte to Chicago to Kansas City, there are signs on the ground that in the final moments before Election Day, well-off, well-educated moderates in historically Republican areas are in fact turning out for Democrats, making the GOP vulnerable on a vast and volatile playing field and ensuring that the fate of even once solidly red districts is uncertain until the end. \u201cI have a little button I wear every once in a while, this is what it says: \u2018Thanks Trump, you turned me into an activist,\u2019\u201d said Beth Monaghan, who earlier this year ran unsuccessfully in a North Carolina GOP state Senate primary. Now, she is a prominent member of Republicans for Dan\u2014a group supporting Democrat Dan McCready\u2014here in the state\u2019s Ninth District, a longtime GOP bastion that stretches east from south Charlotte, where McCready is locked in a close race with Republican Mark Harris.\n\nTrump and Republicans who refused to plant themselves firmly in the middle of the political spectrum very well could pay a steep political price at the poll and may be responsible for a major realignment that takes the suburbs (with women leading the way) out of the Republican column for the foreseeable future. The lazy punditry that \u201cnothing matters\u201d because Trump\u2019s base will stick with him no matter what inane or racist thing he says ignores important math: There are not enough white, working-class men animated by fearmongering to sustain the Republican Party if it loses college-educated, suburban, female and younger voters. If Democrats get a healthy share of those groups in addition to their traditional base of urbanites and nonwhites, they will have wins up and down the ticket, throughout the country. The irrationality caucus simply isn\u2019t big enough or geographically diverse enough to keep the House \u2014 or the presidency for that matter \u2014 in GOP hands if others turn out to vote in strong numbers.\n\nTrump struggles to paint the Democrats as the angry mob, but when suburbanites turn on the TV to hear Trump hyperventilating about a nonexistent \u201cinvasion,\u201d Sen.

Joining him are, from left, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Amazon.com CEO Jeff Bezos. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nThe top executives at Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft have stayed on the political sidelines during the 2018 midterm elections, opting not to donate to federal candidates who might advance Silicon Valley\u2019s political agenda \u2014 or battle back President Trump.\n\nTwo years ago, these tech leaders emerged as some of Trump\u2019s biggest critics, challenging his administration publicly on issues including immigration, climate change and gender equality. Personally, though, they\u2019ve declined since then to write checks to congressional office-seekers who might serve as a bulwark against the White House, federal records show.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook so far has backed one Democratic lawmaker in California, after spending nearly $500,000 \u2014 almost entirely on Democrats, and a few Republicans \u2014 during the 2016 presidential race, according to data published by the Federal Election Commission. Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive of Facebook, and Larry Page and Sergey Brin, co-founders of Google parent Alphabet, so far haven\u2019t written any checks to federal candidates, the records show. All three companies declined to comment for this story.\n\nSome executives are active: Sheryl Sandberg, chief operating officer of Facebook, has contributed nearly $300,000 in the 2018 election, FEC records reveal. Much of her support has gone toward nearly 30 Democratic women running for office, along with a super PAC that encourages women to vie for political office and cast ballots on Election Day.\n\nThe more cautious approach stands in contrast to these tech companies' own workers. By October, employees in the Internet industry had given more than $13 million to federal candidates and campaigns, about 85 percent of which has landed in the hands of Democrats, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics.\n\nIn Silicon Valley, though, politics is a precarious business. On one hand, rank-and-file tech workers in the liberal-leaning Bay Area increasingly demand that their bosses sound off on national issues. But tech executives must balance the needs of their employees with the reality that they must maintain positive relationships with Democrats and Republicans alike. Cook, for example, has criticized Trump yet struck an effective personal relationship with the president. The official corporate political-action committees at other tech companies, including Amazon, Facebook and Google, similarly aim to donate equally to both parties as part of a broader strategy to stave off unwanted regulation.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no single formula explaining why CEOs make personal political donations, as it always involves some mix of cultivated personal chemistry, issue alignment with the company, the member\u2019s future importance to the business and recognition of her prior support,\u201d said Bruce Mehlman, executive director of the Technology CEO Council, which represents the leaders of companies like IBM, Oracle and Qualcomm.\n\nIn 2018, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella hasn\u2019t backed any federal candidates, FEC records show, though he\u2019s previously donated sparingly. Neither has Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. Microsoft and Twitter declined to comment. In contrast, Google CEO Sundar Pichai wrote two checks \u2014 one to a committee for Senate Democrats, another for Senate Republicans \u2014 earlier this year.\n\nAt Amazon, chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos previously had donated little to political candidates \u2014 until August, when he made a $10 million donation to a super PAC that backs both Democratic and Republican office-seekers who have previously served in the military. Bezos and his top deputies have backed other lawmakers this cycle, including Republican Sen. Cory Gardner (Colo.). Amazon\u2019s leaders held a fundraiser for Gardner at company\u2019s Seattle headquarters, according to two people familiar with the event but not authorized to speak on the record.

The donations came despite an earlier, public rift with Trump over his decision to withdraw the United States from an international climate accord. A person familiar with Musk\u2019s thinking, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said he has also contributed to two organizations to elect House and Senate Democrats \u2014 although the reports have not yet been filed with the FEC.

The Trump administration had asked the court to stop the suit, which was filed in 2015, but it did not.\n\nThe suit was filed in Oregon by 21 young people, many of them minors, who are arguing that the federal government\u2019s refusal to take action to fight climate change violates their constitutional right to a clean environment.\n\nWhatever ultimately happens with the suit, it remains a reflection of the activism of young people, which, the author of the following post says, is in some ways unique.

These are not opportunities to wield political power; they are part of the complex foundation out of which these young people must grow. They are trying to figure it out.\n\nThey have to figure it out.\n\nSome dismiss this young generation\u2019s determination, calling it naive or predictable. But others, like me, sense that there is some special combination of opportunity and outrage that gives this diverse and collaborative cohort a quality we can\u2019t quite define. Moral energy. Passion. Whatever it is, it seems to be less about youth and more about responsibility.\n\nGary Lundgren, associate director of the National Scholastic Press Association who runs the organization\u2019s Pacemaker Award for outstanding student journalism, said this young generation realizes its voice matters. Student journalists in high school and middle school have shown great interest in covering national issues at the local level, looking at #MeToo, mass shootings, the opioid crisis, body awareness, and vaping, and in some cases educating their parents.\n\n\u201cThey have communication tools that are immediate and by and large the same tools professionals have,\u201d he said.\n\nThese kids, born after 1996, are a generation without an official name. What is known is that they come after millennials, the cohort defined by the Pew Research Center as born between 1981 and 1996. Post-millennials are the most racially and ethnically diverse generation in our country\u2019s history. Unlike millennials, who are recognized for adapting to social media and constant connectivity, these young people have essentially never lived in a world without them.\n\nBut the uniqueness of this generation goes beyond technology. KJ Dell\u2019Antonia, former lead editor of the New York Times\u2019s Motherlode blog and author of the book, \u201cHow to be a Happier Parent,\u201d said the current generation is growing up in a different terrain than many of its Generation X parents.\n\n\u201cWe grew up in a climbing gym. There were handholds. If I do this, then that will follow. If I get a good grade, this will follow. If I ace the SAT, this will follow,\u201d Dell\u2019Antonia said. Now, she said, \u201cIt\u2019s a bare wall. A cliff face.\u201d\n\nIn the face of that uncertainty, some see the post-millennials taking heightened responsibility. It\u2019s a \u201cpost-trust\u201d world in which the sentiment is: If we don\u2019t step up and try to take care of this, nobody else is going to take care of us.\n\nIt\u2019s both heartening and heartbreaking to see young people fill the void. Three years ago, students at Walter Johnson High School in Montgomery County, Maryland, pushed for more mental health classes after a classmate died by suicide. Suicide is a growing concern for many young people, because it is the third leading cause of death for people ages 10 to 24, and rates have tripled since the 1940s, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nStudent survivors of the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., energized a movement with March for Our Lives. Since the 1999 Columbine shooting, 219,000 children at 223 schools have been exposed to gun violence during school hours, according to figures tabulated by The Washington Post. The updated database indicates the date of the most recent shooting. As I type this, the update reads \u201cfive days ago.\u201d\n\nThe editorial board of Chicago\u2019s University High School\u2019s student newspaper, whose piece, \u201cConservative Students Entitled to Safe Space, Too\u201d was selected as a Pacemaker Award finalist this year, called for fellow students to stand by their school\u2019s founding ideals, defending the need for \u201cmore spaces where students can learn from and even respectfully disagree with one another.\u201d\n\nSome efforts seamlessly link the personal with the global and the imperative of the present moment, such as the young student at my daughter\u2019s school who held a bake sale to help her father\u2019s family in Chennai, India, devastated by 10 days of heavy rains and government failure to the manage water supply.\n\nIn his recent story in the Harvard Graduate School of Education\u2019s magazine Ed, \u201cStudent Activism 2.0,\u201d Zachary Jason looks at an essential question about such activism: Does it make a difference? From the student strike at the Sorbonne in the year 1229 through the activism of Never Again, he cites variables that determine and sustain success. College students, for example, find more success when linking a world issue to a campus policy. Younger students generally do better with issues that are not a direct challenge to their school. And students of color face another challenge: prejudice.\n\nBut youthful generations, of course, become adults, and formative life experiences \u201csuch as world events and technology, economic and social shifts\u201d interact with the \u201caging process to shape people\u2019s views of the world,\u201d according to the Pew Research Center. So how will the divisive tone of today\u2019s politics shape the postmillennial mind-set for problem-solving and political engagement in their adulthood?\n\nThey could expand on the footprint of millennials, a generation that has the highest proportion of voters who identify as independent, and for whom, even among Republicans, a majority says that there is \u201csolid evidence of global warming\u201d and that \u201cAmericans\u2019 openness to people from all over the world is essential to who we are as a nation,\u201d as noted in the Pew Research Center\u2019s report \u201cThe Generation Gap in American Politics.\u201d\n\nThey could reject the premise that issues once considered taboo are still divisive. Pew\u2019s report shows, for the first time, \u201ca majority of baby boomers express support of same-sex marriage.\u201d And multiple surveys show a majority of parents in both major political parties support comprehensive sex education in school.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no ambiguity there,\u201d said Bonnie Rough, author of \u201cBeyond Birds and Bees.\u201d The idea that sex education is considered improper by Americans is an outmoded idea but one with lingering consequences not only for sexuality, she said, but for gender equality. The United States ranks 49th in a Global Gender Gap Report by the World Economic Forum.\n\nThe moment could be an opportunity for schools to rehabilitate the \u201cdisappearing center,\u201d said one school administrator with 14 years of experience. He suspects the new generation will begin to find a new framework and norms to replace the ones that are outdated.\n\n\u201cSocieties have been through watershed moments before when older ways of thinking begin to collapse or show signs of their age,\u201d he said. \u201cInevitably, during this turbulent transition period, the old ways aren\u2019t working, but we haven\u2019t figured out what a new way will look like. Eventually something will emerge. It always does. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the current generation of students are leaders in that.\u201d\n\nThere are many ways to lead, of course. The oldest of these post-millennials are just reaching voting age, capturing 5 percent of the adult population.\n\nThey can run for Congress in 2022.", "\n\nPrince Turki bin Abdullah, seen welcoming guests to pay tribute to the late King Abdullah in 2015, is among an unknown number of Saudis detained by order of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. (Dmitry Astakhov/AFP/Getty Images)\n\n\u2014 Somewhere in this kingdom, Prince Turki bin Abdullah is locked away.\n\nTurki, 47, was once a golden scion of Saudi Arabia\u2019s gilded royal family, a prominent son of the late King Abdullah and a fighter pilot with advanced degrees who trained in the United States and Britain. He was the powerful governor of Riyadh province, then chief executive of the multibillion-dollar King Abdullah Foundation, which funds charitable work around the world.\n\nHe is now among an unknown number of super-wealthy Saudis who remain detained a full year after Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman startled his country by turning Riyadh\u2019s posh Ritz-Carlton hotel into a five-star jail for some of the nation\u2019s most prominent citizens in what he called an anti-corruption sweep.\n\nTurki, whom officials have reportedly accused of graft related to construction of the Riyadh subway, remains detained without any formal charges. His chief of staff, Gen. Ali al-Qahtani, was also arrested and died in detention under circumstances that have never been fully explained.\n\nEarly this year, the Saudi attorney general said 56 men remained locked up, some the subject of criminal investigations, with more than $106 billion in cash, real estate, businesses, securities and other assets recovered in the Ritz operation.\n\nMohammed said in an interview last month with Bloomberg News that only eight men were still being detained. He offered no other details except to say, \u201cThey\u2019re with their lawyers and facing the system that we have in Saudi Arabia.\u201d\n\nBut other people familiar with the detentions said the number is much higher, with 45 Ritz detainees still locked up.\n\nOne of those may have won his freedom Friday when Saudi authorities released Prince Khaled bin Talal, 56, a cousin of Mohammed and Turki. Khaled is a businessman and noted religious conservative who reportedly opposed the crown prince\u2019s decision to strip power from the country\u2019s notorious religious \u00adpolice.\n\nHuman rights activists and other analysts said Mohammed may be preparing to release more of the detainees to help cool the international furor over the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi on Oct. 2. Khashoggi\u2019s death inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul at the hands of Saudi agents has strained relations with Washington and Europe and drawn attention to the crown prince\u2019s human rights practices, including his record of locking up scores of his critics.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want to do it, but they are under pressure, and they will do it to release some pressure,\u201d said Yahya Assiri, a Saudi human rights activist living in self-exile in London.\n\nBut he cautioned against overstating the importance of the release of Khaled, suggesting it was done mainly to shore up support for Mohammed within the royal family at a time when the crown prince and his father, the current monarch, King Salman, are under stress.\n\n\u201cI think this is trying to show family unity in the face of scrutiny,\u201d said Adam Coogle, a Middle East researcher for Human Rights Watch who closely monitors the kingdom.\n\nMohammed\u2019s roundup of wealthy Saudis a year ago helped cement his control over many of the country\u2019s most powerful individuals and neutralized potential political rivals within the royal family.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about money and power,\u201d said a person close to the royal family. \u201cMohammed bin Salman understands that if you take away their money, you take away their power.\u201d\n\nFaced with long detentions or other punishment, some of the Ritz detainees agreed to hand over the demanded cash, which often amounted to most of their net worth, according to accounts from family, friends and human rights groups.\n\nMany Saudis and foreign observers have applauded Mohammed for what they view as a long-overdue reckoning for the clubby culture of royals and well-connected families, who have long treated Saudi Arabia\u2019s land, oil and riches as their own.\n\nBut others see the detentions \u2014 and reports of torture at the Ritz \u2014 as a brutal move by Mohammed to settle scores and solidify his personal power. Critics say that explanation fits with his record of arresting scores of human rights and women\u2019s rights activists and even clerics who disagree with his policies.\n\nSaudi officials strongly deny that anyone has been tortured. \u201cThat is not who we are,\u201d one official said. \u201cWe do not torture. That word has never been in our vocabulary in Saudi Arabia.\u201d\n\nFamily tensions\n\nThe crown prince appears to have targeted the family of the late King Abdullah in particular. Several observers said it is the product of tensions between the Salman and Abdullah wings of the family that go back many years but became especially pronounced because of Mohammed\u2019s rapid rise to power.\n\n\n\nKing Abdullah with other royal family princes during the funeral of his brother Prince Sattam bin Abdel Aziz in 2013. (Saudi Press Agency/AP)\n\nTurki in recent years had grown increasingly concerned at the signs of Mohammed\u2019s accumulation of power, especially his control of an investigative unit in the Interior Ministry \u201cthat could be used to make all sorts of accusations,\u201d said one of the people close to the royal family.\n\nIn addition to jailing Turki, Mohammed also arrested three of Abdullah\u2019s other sons, including Prince Muteib bin Abdullah, 65, head of the national guard, who was fired from his job. Two other sons, Prince Faisal bin Abdullah, 40, a former head of the Saudi Red Crescent Authority,and Prince Mishaal bin Abdullah, a former governor of Mecca province, were briefly detained after they complained about the death of Qahtani, 55, who had been \u201cin the peak of health\u201d when he was arrested, according to the person close to the royal family.\n\n\n\nPrince Salman bin Abdul Aziz bin Salman, left, who was imprisoned in January, at a function with King Salman\u2019s brother, Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz, in August 2017. (Obtained by The Washington Post)\n\nAlso detained two months after the initial Ritz roundup was Prince Salman bin Abdul Aziz bin Salman, 36, who is married to a daughter of King Abdullah. His father was also arrested, and the two remain in detention with no formal charges filed, according to his lawyer.\n\nSeveral people with ties to the royal family said Mohammed\u2019s focus on Abdullah\u2019s family seemed designed to sideline potential rivals for power and to seize control of the King Abdullah Foundation fund, overseen by Turki, which is estimated to be worth $20 billion to $30 billion.\n\nKing Salman, while still governor of Riyadh province, began grooming his son for leadership roles, naming him as a top adviser when Mohammed was in his early twenties. When Salman became crown prince in 2012, also serving as defense minister, Mohammed was again installed as a top adviser.\n\nAt the time, King Abdullah was worried about Mohammed\u2019s rapid ascent, according to a former Western diplomat with decades of experience in Riyadh. \u201cKing Abdullah was concerned about that kind of authority being given to the young fella, who was not even 30 yet,\u201d the diplomat said.\n\nAbout a decade ago, Mohammed drew King Abdullah\u2019s ire when a top economic adviser complained to the monarch about Mohammed\u2019s stock market investments, prompting the royal court to \u201ccensure\u201d Mohammed, according to a person close to the royal family.\n\nLater, Mohammed again angered King Abdullah by firing a number of deputies in the Defense Ministry, that person said. Abdullah moved to ban Mohammed from the ministry.\n\nThe resentments ran both ways. Salman, before he became the monarch, grew upset when King Abdullah named another of their brothers to succeed Salman as Riyadh governor, the diplomat said. Salman had held the governor\u2019s post since 1963 and wanted to keep it in his family line, the diplomat said.\n\n'Treated as criminals'\n\nAccording to numerous media reports, some of the detainees are being held in al-Hair \u00adhigh-security prison south of Riyadh. Others are reportedly locked in private homes and required to wear ankle monitors.\n\nThose being detained, according to media reports and accounts from family members, friends and others close to the royal family, include:\n\n\u25cfAdel Fakeih, 59, the former mayor of Jiddah and former minister of economy and planning.\n\n\u25cfWalid Fitaihi, 54, a prominent physician who hosted a popular television show dealing with health and wellness, founded a hospital in Jiddah and holds U.S. citizenship.\n\n\u25cfAmr al-Dabbagh, 52, chairman of the Jiddah-based Al-Dabbagh Group and former head of the Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority, one of the top economic positions in the country\n\n\u25cfMohammed Hussein al-Amoudi, 72, a Saudi-Ethiopian businessman who had a net worth of $8.1 billion last year from his diversified interests in a Swedish oil refinery, Saudi gas stations and an Ethiopian conglomerate involved in gold mining, farming and construction, according to Forbes.\n\n\u25cfBakr bin Laden, Jiddah-based chairman of the powerful Saudi Binladin Group, a multibillion-dollar conglomerate, one of country\u2019s most successful and influential companies.\n\nBeyond any bad blood between the Salman and Abdullah wings of the royal family or an effort to bring wealthy Saudis to heel, some observers also see historic regional rivalries at play in the detentions, noting that those locked up have been disproportionately from the Hijaz region on the Red Sea, including Jiddah and the holy cities of Mecca and Medina.\n\n\u201cThese are the families that helped Abdul Aziz unify and build the country in the 1920s and \u201930s,\u201d said Robert Lacey, a British historian who has written extensively about Saudi Arabia and the royal family. \u201cNow they are treated as criminals.\u201d\n\nFahim reported from Istanbul.\n\nRead more:\n\nSaudi campaign to abduct and silence rivals abroad goes back decades\n\nCrown prince Mohammed bin Salman is \u2018chief of the tribe\u2019 in a cowed House of Saud\n\nSecret recordings give insight into Saudi attempt to silence critics\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "The road to recovery has been a long one for David Morales, who was injured during the al-Qaeda attack on the USS Cole 18 years ago last month. And he knew it would be difficult to collect the nearly $315 million that he and others wounded in the attack were awarded in their suit against the Republic of Sudan.\n\nBut he didn\u2019t expect the case to go all the way to the Supreme Court, and he certainly didn\u2019t think he would see the Trump administration aligned with Sudan on the other side of the legal battle.\n\n\u201cI thought the United States would be on the side of its veterans,\u201d Morales said in a recent interview. \u201cIt was very surprising, especially with Mr. Trump in office. It seems like he is in support of veterans. It kind of hurts.\u201d\n\nYears of litigation and millions of dollars in awards are on the line this week as the Supreme Court addresses a seemingly mundane question: whether notices of the lawsuits against Sudan were sent to the wrong address eight years ago.\n\nThe notices were addressed to the Sudanese Embassy in Washington at 2210 Massachusetts Ave. NW, where an employee signed for them. One federal appeals court has decreed that was adequate.\n\nBut Sudan says that federal law, as well as the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, requires papers to be served on the foreign minister at his official address, which in this case is in the Sudanese capital of Khartoum. A different federal appeals court has agreed with that interpretation.\n\nInto this legal and diplomatic quagmire has stepped, ever so gingerly, U.S. Solicitor General Noel Francisco. He, as well as Saudi Arabia and Libya, filed an amicus brief agreeing with Sudan, one of four nations the State Department lists as sponsoring terrorism.\n\n\u201cThe United States deeply sympathizes with the extraordinary injuries suffered by respondents, and it condemns in the strongest possible terms the terrorist acts that caused those injuries,\u201d Francisco wrote in his brief to the Supreme Court.\n\nBut \u201clitigation against foreign states in U.S. courts can have significant foreign affairs implications for the United States,\u201d he continued, \u201cand can affect the reciprocal treatment of the United States in the courts of other nations.\u201d\n\nWashington lawyer Kannon Shanmugam represents those wounded in the attack in the lawsuit being considered by the Supreme Court and, in a separate suit, the families of those killed. It has been put on hold pending the court\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cIt is mind-boggling that the government has decided in this case to side with a state sponsor of terrorism and against men and women who are seeking to recover for grievous injuries suffered in the service of our country,\u201d Shanmugam wrote in a brief to the court.\n\n\u201cIn any event, this court should reject the government\u2019s sloppy analysis and its dubious bottom line.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuits arise from the deadly attack on Oct. 12, 2000, when al-Qaeda suicide bombers in a fiberglass boat detonated explosives near the destroyer Cole, which was refueling at a harbor in Yemen.\n\nThe blast killed 17 American sailors \u2014 15 men and two women \u2014 and wounded 42 others. Years later, the suits were filed against Sudan under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, alleging Sudan had supplied material support to al-Qaeda and Osama bin Laden, who lived in the country for a time.\n\nIn the case involving the wounded that the Supreme Court is hearing Wednesday, Republic of Sudan v. Harrison, the plaintiffs filed suit in federal court in the District and asked the clerk to send the documents to Sudan\u2019s foreign minister at the embassy in Washington.\n\nSomeone at the embassy accepted them. But Sudan never responded to the suit, nor did its representatives put on a defense. (Sudan\u2019s culpability is not an issue the Supreme Court is considering.) District Judge Royce Lamberth held an evidentiary hearing and entered a default judgment against Sudan in the amount of $314,705,896.\n\nThe judgment was registered in New York in an attempt to access Sudanese assets held in three banks there. It was at that point Sudan filed notice in the case, telling the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit that the judgment should be vacated because the service at the embassy did not comply with the law.\n\nAt issue is the part of the immunities act that details what a party must do to file suit against a foreign government. Relevant here is that the notice \u201cbe addressed and dispatched by the clerk of the court to the head of the ministry of foreign affairs of the foreign state concerned.\u201d\n\nLawyers representing Sudan say that is most naturally read to mean the package be sent to the foreign minister in that country, not to its diplomatic mission in Washington. In addition, serving process at an embassy violated an article of the Vienna Convention that says \u201cthe premises of the mission shall be inviolable.\u201d\n\nThose \u201cinviolability\u201d provisions \u201cconstitute bedrock principles of international diplomacy, are enshrined in international law and practice, and are widely accepted in the United States and beyond as prohibiting service by mail on or through a diplomatic mission,\u201d Washington lawyer Christopher M. Curran, one of Sudan\u2019s lawyers, told the Supreme Court in a brief.\n\nSudan is supported by a group of international law professors and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which is implicated in the killing of columnist Jamal Khashoggi at its consulate in Turkey. \u201cAs much as any foreign state, the Kingdom has a strong interest in preserving the inviolability of foreign missions, including the longstanding prohibition against serving legal process at mission premises,\u201d it tells the court.\n\nMore important is Sudan\u2019s support from the United States. It does not accept notice at its embassies around the world, and ruling against Sudan would endanger the government\u2019s \u201ccontinued ability to successfully assert that it has not been properly served in these instances,\u201d Francisco wrote in the government\u2019s brief.\n\nThe 2nd Circuit, hearing the case of those wounded in the attack, ruled for the plaintiffs, reasoning that the notice was not served on the mission in Washington, but to the foreign minister via the personnel there. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit, in the case involving the survivors of the dead, disagreed, and said the judgments should be vacated.\n\nThat is hard to explain to Lorrie Triplett, whose last glimpse of husband Andrew was in her rearview mirror, as the sailor rode a bike she had bought him back to the Cole when it was still docked in Virginia.\n\nThe money she would receive would go to care for her two daughters, whose memories of their father are faint, she said.\n\n\u201cTo say that we don\u2019t deserve something that should have been, it\u2019s beyond me,\u201d she said.", "I haven\u2019t heard about any flood advisories yet, but Four Mile Run was running pretty high this morning in Arlington. \u2066@capitalweather\u2069 #HardRainGonnaFall pic.twitter.com/1ye8T9NQrn \u2014 Tom Mockler (@TomMockler) November 5, 2018\n\nAnother day in the District, another drenching.\n\nIn just over six hours, 1.43 inches of rain soaked D.C., breaking the previous Nov. 5 daily record of 1 inch from 1939.\n\nThe rain came down hard and fast, slowing Monday morning\u2019s commute to a crawl.\n\n\u201cI could barely see the road and traffic lights and trucks were zooming around me, sending waves of water into my windshield,\u201d tweeted @lavawitch.\n\nThe combination of downpours and wet leaves clogged drains and resulted in ponding of water on roadways.

(Washington Post) (Illustration by Kate Rabinowitz for The Washington Post)\n\nIt has been a big year for marijuana policy in North America. Mexico\u2019s supreme court overturned pot prohibition last week, while Canada\u2019s recreational marijuana market officially opened its doors in October.\n\nStateside, recreational marijuana use became legal in Vermont on July 1, Oklahoma voters approved one of the country\u2019s most progressive medical marijuana bills in June, the New York Department of Health officially recommended legalization to the governor and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands legalized recreational use.\n\nNow, legalization advocates are hoping to build on these successes with a number of statewide ballot measures up for consideration Tuesday, including full recreational legalization in two states and medical marijuana in two more. Here\u2019s a rundown of what the measures say and where the polling on them stands.\n\nMichigan: Recreational use\n\nMichigan voters will consider a Colorado-style recreational bill that would legalize the sale and use of marijuana for individuals over the age of 21. Michigan\u2019s bill is more permissive than the law in other states: It would allow individuals to possess up to 2 1/2 ounces of marijuana at any given time (most other states allow one ounce) and would allow them to grow up to 12 individual plants for their own consumption (most other states permit six).\n\nThe latest polls all show the measure passing with a comfortable margin. Democratic gubernatorial candidate Gretchen Whitmer supports legalization, while Republican candidate Bill Schuette released a statement saying he does not \u201cpersonally support legalizing recreational marijuana but as governor he will respect the will of the voters.\u201d\n\nNorth Dakota: Recreational use\n\nNorth Dakota\u2019s ballot measure came out of nowhere, taking much of the marijuana policy world by surprise. The initiative was engineered by local marijuana reform advocates, with no initial assistance from the big national players such as the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) and the Marijuana Policy Project.\n\nAs a result, the measure doesn\u2019t follow the template for recreational marijuana programs set up in other states. It places no limits on possession, and legalizes the sale and commercialization of the drug without setting up a regulatory structure to govern those sales. Supporters say they expect the legislature to iron out those details if the bill passes. The measure would also expunge the criminal records of individuals with prior marijuana convictions.\n\nThe polling on the measure is all over the place, with two surveys fielded at roughly the same time in October yielding opposite, lopsided results: One showed the initiative passing 51 percent to 36 percent, while the other showed it failing with 65 percent opposed. With numbers like those, it\u2019s hard to predict how this one will shake out.\n\nMissouri: Medical use\n\nMissouri voters will consider not one, not two, but three separate medical marijuana initiatives at the polls. The measures differ on some details, like how much to tax medical pot and whether patients are allowed to grow their own plants. The one with the broadest range of endorsements from national drug policy groups as well as local newspapers is Amendment 2, which is similar to other states' medical policies: Doctors would be able to recommend marijuana for a number of specified ailments, and patients would be able to obtain the drug either through a dispensary or by growing it at home.\n\nPolling on the issue has been scant, but a survey in August showed that voters supported, in general terms, an amendment to the state constitution that would legalize medical marijuana. If two or more of the measures pass, it\u2019s likely that the measure that receives the most votes will go into effect.\n\nUtah: Medical use\n\nUtah voters will weigh in on medical marijuana, but the eventual result is essentially a foregone conclusion. In October, supporters and opponents of the medical marijuana measure struck a compromise: The governor would convene a special session of the legislature immediately after the election to craft a more limited medical marijuana bill, regardless of the ballot item\u2019s outcome.\n\nBackers of the ballot measure agreed to the compromise proposal because in Utah, legislators have the power to overturn statutory ballot initiatives with a majority vote. \u201cIf Proposition 2 passed without any agreement on next steps, patients may have been left waiting years to access legal medical cannabis,\u201d said the Marijuana Policy Project\u2019s Matthew Schweich in an October statement. \u201cThis compromise eliminates that uncertainty and ensures legislative leaders are committed to making the law work.\u201d\n\nOther medical marijuana supporters are unhappy with the proposed compromise bill, which is more limited in scope than medical marijuana programs in other states.

Activists hope the results will help persuade Wisconsin legislators to consider legalization at the state level.", "In this Oct. 22, 2018 photo, garbage containers are placed on a corner in the Centro Havana neighborhood in Havana, Cuba. As Havana prepares for next year\u2019s 500th anniversary of its founding, the Cuban government is struggling to pick up the trash. Rotting piles of garbage are accumulating on corners throughout the city as garbage trucks go unrepaired and workers abandoned the low-paid, unappealing work of collecting garbage. (Desmond Boylan/Associated Press)\n\nHAVANA \u2014 Luxury hotels are rising fast along the Prado, the tree-lined colonial boulevard that is home to many of Havana\u2019s best-known architectural masterworks.\n\nYet within sight of five-star lodgings charging $500 a night, stray cats and flies swarm mountains of uncollected trash. Piles reeking of rotting waste spill out of dumpsters and climb waist-high as garbage trucks fail to appear for days and even weeks.\n\nOne of the most basic functions of city government \u2014 trash collection \u2014 has become a serious problem in one of Latin America\u2019s most spectacular cities, which celebrates the 500th anniversary of its founding next year.\n\nIn the Atares neighborhood just outside Old Havana, Daysi Boza, 71, sleeps with a stick laid across the bottom of her door to keep out rats that feed on the trash spilling from the four big garbage bins feet from her door.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t even remember how many years this has gone on,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery day it\u2019s filthy, stinking \u2014 a pigsty.\u201d\n\nThe root cause appears to be the cash crunch affecting Cuba\u2019s entire government, leaving infrastructure crumbling, suppliers unpaid and state-run businesses without the inputs needed to produce basic goods.\n\nCuban officials blame the six-decade U.S. embargo for strangling its economy. The government\u2019s critics point to the inefficiency and pervasive small-scale corruption in one of the word\u2019s last centrally planned economies.\n\nOfficials say Havana has fewer than half of the 100 garbage trucks it needs to conduct daily trash pickups for the city\u2019s 2 million residents. Many of those trucks, mostly Chinese-made, regularly are out of service due to a lack of spare parts.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m surprised \u2014 I expect to see crumbling buildings, but not so much trash,\u201d said Rosario Aneas, a 38-year-old art professor from Spain on a short trip to Cuba. \u201cIt\u2019s affects the image of Cuba, mars it, and it\u2019s a shame for such a beautiful city.\u201d\n\nAggravating the problem is the fact that virtually no Havana residents use trash bags, which are difficult to find and even when available are hard to afford on a state salary of about $30 a month.\n\nInstead of bags, people collect trash in plastic paint buckets that they empty into dumpsters that sit on most street corners in Havana. Because the bins are filled with loose trash, they spill over and reeking garbage piles up as soon as a truck misses a few days\u2019 pickups.\n\nThe problem is so serious that Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel has gotten involved, saying at a recent meeting that his government should look for foreign investors to help fix the trash crisis.\n\nHis administration hopes to create a $100 million company controlled by the Cuban government with a minority share held by foreign investors to handle Havana\u2019s 2,400 tons of daily trash, earning money by recycling and producing energy from landfill gas.\n\nForeign Investment Minister Rodrigo Malmierca told The Associated Press recently that the government had negotiated with a Spanish business but the talks fell through and Cuba is now talking with other potential partners.\n\nThe trash problem worsened after 2010 economic reforms that allowed Cubans to buy and sell houses and start small businesses in their homes. Instead of paying for professional carting as required by the city, many works crews simply dump sacks full of rubble alongside the nearest trash bin.\n\nMany Habaneros dump their domestic trash on top of the rubble, creating mountains of foul-smelling refuse.\n\n\u201cSome people throw bags of trash from the fifth floor window,\u201d said Luis Alberto Martinez, a 50-year-old messenger.\n\nThe head of the municipal government said in May that along with new trucks, Havana needed 12,000 new dumpsters to handle the trash problem.\n\nDozens of Cuban have been arrested in recent years for stealing the big metal bins and cutting them up in workshops to make improvised tubes and other goods in a country with shortages of virtually every product.\n\nCuban authorities say they are hopeful that 60 trash trucks donated by Japan will arrive by the end of the year to help alleviate the problem.\n\nMeanwhile, Habaneros on every side of the trash problem are growing frustrated.\n\n\u201cPeople are really undisciplined,\u201d said Victor Leon, a city worker in a crew of six men, some prisoners on work release, picking up trash that had fallen on the street as a garbage truck emptied bins in the Cerro neighborhood.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re cleaning up around the dumpsters, but you\u2019ll see, in 45 minutes this will look just as bad.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAndrea Rodr\u00edguez on Twitter: www.twitter.com/ARodriguezAP\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)\n\nOpinion writer\n\nThe degree to which President Trump\u2019s blatant misstatements of fact are accepted as simply politics as normal among Republicans was on full display when Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel appeared on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday. The subject was the closing ad from the GOP stoking fear of immigrants and misrepresenting the circumstances under which a convicted cop killer got into the United States:\n\nJAKE TAPPER: So the president\u2019s closing argument in the midterms is focused on fears of undocumented immigrants. That\u2019s the focus. He tweeted out this racially charged video about an undocumented immigrant convicted of killing two sheriff\u2019s deputies. Here\u2019s a little snippet of this incendiary video. I mean, factually, it\u2019s not true, because, actually, he was let into the country most recently under George W. Bush\u2019s administration, and Joe Arpaio is the one who released him, I think, most recently. But setting aside the factual errors, several Republicans have condemned the substance of this video. Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, called it sickening, saying that \u2014 quote \u2014 \u201cRepublicans everywhere should the denounce it.\u201d Congressman Carlos Curbelo, Republican of Florida, says he hopes this doesn\u2019t work. Congressman Ryan Costello, Republican of Pennsylvania, says, no Republican in a close district wants to talk about this. Do you have any concerns at all about this Web video? MCDANIEL: I think the president\u2019s highlighting the point once again that we don\u2019t \u2014 and I think everybody agrees with this, Jake \u2014 we didn\u2019t want this individual in our country. He came in first under Bill Clinton and then under George Bush. And he did kill police. And you see in this video, he said, I would kill more people if I could. We don\u2019t want people being deported and being criminals and then coming back into this country. And the president was very clear in his speech this week. Listen, we know good people are trying to get in this country, too. They see the prosperity. They see the economic growth. \u2026 TAPPER: You don\u2019t have any issues at all about \u2014 about \u2014 MCDANIEL: I think the president is talking about a multitude of issues. And to say he\u2019s only focusing on one thing is false. He is focusing on the fact that Democrats time and time again won\u2019t work with him. TAPPER: But on that Web \u2014 but that Web video, you don\u2019t have any issue with that? You don\u2019t \u2014 it\u2019s factually inaccurate and it\u2019s racially incendiary. You don\u2019t have any issue with that? MCDANIEL: It\u2019s \u2014 I have an issue with our immigration system that\u2019s not being fixed, and Democrats won\u2019t work with the president. And we have caravans coming.\n\nIn other words, the ad is wrong and incendiary, but so what? That in a nutshell is the Trump GOP. Whatever it takes, stir the base. No number of factual inaccuracies, no amount of race-baiting is too much to bear.\n\nThe Post reports:\n\nThe 2016 election confirmed that a potential president could run \u2014 and win \u2014 after stoking racism. Now, in their closing days, the midterms are shaping up as a demonstration of whether the entire Republican Party can succeed by following his lead. By running so overtly on racially tinged messages, the GOP is putting that explosive form of politics on the ballot. If Republicans maintain control of the House, the notion of running a campaign built on blunt, race-based attacks on immigrants and minorities will have been validated. A loss, on the other hand, might prompt a number of Republicans to call for a rethinking of the party\u2019s direction \u2014 but that would collide with a sitting president who, if anything, relishes over-the-edge rhetoric.\n\nWho cares, the Republicans figure, if the caravan is nearly a thousand miles away? It\u2019s an invasion! Who cares if illegal immigration is declining? It\u2019s a crisis!\n\nPolitico explained:\n\nThe word \u201ccrisis\u201d typically describes a problem that\u2019s getting worse. According to Customs and Border Protection, arrests along the southwest border \u2014 the standard metric used to calculate illegal border crossings \u2014 numbered 396,579 in fiscal year 2018, which ended Oct. 1. That\u2019s lower than the average over the previous decade (400,751). It\u2019s also lower than the number of border arrests in fiscal 2016, 2014 and 2013. \u2026 And border arrests over the past decade, averaging 400,000 annually, are very low compared with recent history. In the 1980s and 1990s, border arrests seldom fell below 1 million. Border arrests peaked at 1,643,679 in 2000, and remained at or near the 1 million mark until the last two years of George W. Bush\u2019s presidency.\n\nIntroduce facts into the discussion, and you\u2019ll be accused of being unserious about the problem, which must be terrible, since so many people are so freaked out about it. \u201cCrime wave!\u201d shout the anti-immigration advocates. Well, as the Cato Institute\u2019s Alex Nowrasteh notes, \u201cIllegal immigrants, non-citizens, and legal immigrants are less likely to be incarcerated, convicted, or arrested for crimes than native-born Americans are.\u201d But they\u2019re taking American jobs! Actually, unemployment is at 3.7 percent, and wages are going up.\n\nIndeed, Trump\u2019s view has become increasingly apocalyptic. (\u201cPresident Trump is painting an astonishingly apocalyptic vision of America under Democratic control in the campaign\u2019s final days, unleashing a torrent of falsehoods and portraying his political opponents as desiring crime, squalor and poverty,\u201d The Post reports. \u201cAs voters prepare to render their first verdict on his presidency in Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections, Trump is claiming that Democrats want to erase the nation\u2019s borders and provide sanctuary to drug dealers, human traffickers and MS-13 killers. He is warning that they would destroy the economy, obliterate Medicare and unleash a wave of violent crime that endangers families everywhere. And he is alleging that they would transform the United States into Venezuela with socialism run amok.\u201d) But at the root of the lies and the hysteria are the hatred and fear of immigrants.\n\nBase prejudice and conspiracy thinking require one to suspend rational thought and disregard evidence. That\u2019s now the standard operating procedure for Republicans. If you doubt it, just listen to McDaniel \u2014 or worse, the president \u2014 and you\u2019ll see how lying is now critical to hyping the president\u2019s favorite issue, the one issue that seems to bind him to his base. Lying, you see, is now an essential strategy for a party that has fully embraced nativism. Without lies, the GOP couldn\u2019t stoke fear of immigrants, and without fear of immigrants, Trump would have virtually nothing to talk about.\n\nRead more from Jennifer Rubin:\n\nThe polls tell us something but not everything\n\nLike his lies, Trump\u2019s racist comments don\u2019t surprise, but they should be counted\n\nGive credit to Bob Corker for this\n\nIf Republicans loved the troops so much, they\u2019d denounce the border stunt\n\nLooking for that better America", "\n\nA man votes at an early voting polling station in California on Sunday. The weather on the West Coast will be sunny and dry on Election Day. (Mike Nelson/EPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nWith summerlike severe storms on one side of the country and a wintry shot of snowfall on the other, the atmosphere appears to be undecided on Election Day. In some parts of the country, voters will need to time it right if they want to stay dry as they cast their ballots.\n\nHere\u2019s how the weather will affect your trip to the polls.\n\nNortheast\n\nClouds overspread the Interstate 95 corridor between 9 a.m. and noon, with light showers breaking out after lunchtime. The onset will be a bit later along the coast. Boston will make it to 60 degrees before the rain breezes in, while New York should climb into the mid-60s.\n\nOverall, it will be a blustery day with strong winds from the south ahead of the cold front. Winds will be particularly gusty in Upstate New York in the higher elevations, as well as on the banks of Lakes Erie and Ontario. A narrow zone of stronger winds \u2014 up to 45 mph \u2014 will sweep northeastward from Long Island into Rhode Island and southeastern Massachusetts around nightfall.\n\nPlanning to vote after work? You might consider hitting the polls early, as the heaviest downpours will arrive just in time to interrupt the evening commute. An isolated rumble of thunder is possible. Rainfall totals look to remain below a third of an inch.\n\nMid-Atlantic\n\nScattered showers are likely in the morning, then storms are possible after noon. The Storm Prediction Center issued a slight risk of severe thunderstorms for the Baltimore and Washington metro areas, and south into the Carolinas. Damaging winds are the main threat from these storms, but an isolated tornado cannot be ruled out. Storms should be over along I-95 by late afternoon.\n\nSoutheast\n\nThe Storm Prediction Center issued a slight risk of severe storms for parts of the Carolinas and Georgia. In the Carolinas, scattered thunderstorms are possible in the afternoon. A stormy morning is in store for Alabama and the northern third of Georgia, where leftover thunderstorms from Monday night could be ongoing. Heavy downpours are possible from Mobile to the Big Bend of Florida. The rest of the Sunshine State appears to enjoy mainly that \u2014 sunshine!\n\nOhio-Tennessee Valley\n\nA line of thunderstorms will trek through in the predawn hours Tuesday morning, bringing heavy rain and the risk of damaging straight-line winds and isolated tornadoes. Once the storms have passed, high pressure and sunny skies move in for the rest of Election Day.\n\nMidwest\n\nVoters in Michigan, southern Wisconsin, northeast Indiana and Ohio wake up to rain pelting their windows and gusty winds. Steady rain will turn to scattered showers through the afternoon from west to east. Election Day is chilly and damp over the Great Lakes region.\n\nIllinois, Indiana, Iowa and Missouri will see clearing skies behind early morning showers. Blustery weather will follow as chillier air descends from Canada. Highs will top out in the mid-40s for most of the region, and around 40 farther west.\n\nPlains\n\nThe central third of the United States will boast excellent voting weather. Skies should be at least partly sunny from Texas all the way to the Canadian border. Highs in Texas will be in the 70s, in Oklahoma in the 60s, and cooler as one travels northward. Kansas and Nebraska look to the transition zone, as north of there the Dakotas will be socked in in the 30s.\n\nRockies\n\nWhile the lower elevations will be meteorologically uneventful, high elevations will face snow on their way to the polls. A light one to two inches is possible in western Montana and northwestern Wyoming. As much as six to eight inches is possible in Idaho, centered primarily over the Clearwater Mountains and Bitterroot Range. Snow will linger in the forecast there through Thursday.\n\nWest\n\nWall-to-wall sunshine and temperatures a few degrees above seasonable norms will stretch along the California coast. Showers are possible along the Oregon and Washington coasts, including Portland and Seattle, but skies should be mostly sunny farther inland. Showers or flurries are possible in the higher elevations to the east, including Spokane.", "UNITED NATIONS \u2014 The U.N. Security Council on Monday authorized action against illicit oil exports from Libya until February 2020, and it added planning and committing sexual and gender-based violence as reasons for sanctions over objections from Russia and China.\n\nThe vote in the U.N.\u2019s most powerful body on a resolution that also renewed asset freezes and travel bans on Libyan political spoilers was 13-0, with Russia and China abstaining.\n\n\u201cThis sends a powerful signal that the international community will not tolerate such crimes,\u201d senior British diplomat Stephen Hickey, whose country drafted the resolution, said of the addition of sexual and gender-based violence.\n\nLibya plunged into chaos after the 2011 uprising that ousted and killed longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi and is now governed by rival administrations in the east and west. It has also become a haven for armed groups, including several from neighboring countries, which survive on looting and human trafficking.\n\nThe Netherlands and Sweden pushed for including \u201cplanning, directing or committing acts involving sexual and gender-based violence\u201d as criteria for sanctions, citing the increasingly worrying problem in Libya especially against migrants trying to reach Europe.\n\nDutch Ambassador Karel Van Oostrom told the council after the vote that such violence \u201cis directly connected to the issues of peace and security we are discussing today.\u201d\n\nRussian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia strongly disagreed, saying sexual and gender-based violence is a crime that is dealt with by national governments and is considered at the U.N. Human Rights Council and the Commission on the Status of Women. It is not a threat to international peace and security that the Security Council should deal with, he said.\n\n\u201cWe are under the impression that the countries pushing this into the Security Council agenda are attempting to gain domestic political capital through the imposition of sanctions regimes against other states,\u201d Nebenzia said. \u201cThe facts of such crimes perpetrated against migrants in Libya only confirm our premise that the most effective means of combatting this scourge is eradicating the relevant criminal networks.\u201d\n\nU.S. deputy ambassador Jonathan Cohen said the resolution should have been adopted unanimously and \u201cbe sending a clear message to the Libyan people \u2014 that we are united behind you and that we on the Security Council will hold Libyan spoilers to account for their actions.\u201d\n\nIn June, the Security Council voted unanimously to impose sanctions on six leaders of criminal networks engaged in human trafficking and migrant smuggling from Libya, and in September it slapped sanctions on Libyan militia leader Ibrahim Jadran for attacking Libyan oil facilities in the summer.\n\nThe resolution adopted Monday extended authorization for U.N. member states to board suspect vessels and return illegally seized oil to the Libyan government until Feb. 15, 2020. The initial resolution was adopted in March 2014, three days after U.S. Navy SEAL commandos seized a tanker off Cyprus containing Libyan oil that a militia controlling the country\u2019s oil terminals was trying to export in defiance of the central government.\n\nThe resolution also calls on U.N. member states to report to the Security Council committee monitoring sanctions against Libya on their implementation of the measures, including those recently adopted. It also extended the mandate of the panel of experts assisting the committee until Feb. 15, 2020.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(Keith Srakocic/Associated Press)\n\nYou\u2019ve heard similar things before, but this time it\u2019s etched in stone: Pittsburgh Steelers running back Le\u2019Veon Bell must report to the team by Nov. 13 if he wants to play this season. To judge from two words posted Monday by the three-time Pro Bowler, he might be arriving a little sooner than that.\n\n\u201cFairwell [sic] Miami,\u201d Bell said on Twitter, presumably referring to the city where he has been spending much of his time this season, training and, at least on occasion, hitting the odd nightclub.

Not long before his tweet Monday, ESPN\u2019s Jeremy Fowler reported that the Steelers \u201chave not had contact with Le\u2019Veon Bell this week,\u201d adding that \u201cbarring new development in next few days, [the] team doesn\u2019t expect Bell to report for [the] Thursday night game against Carolina.\u201d\n\nThat lack of transparency was feeding rumors last month that he would be reporting around the time of the team\u2019s Week 7 bye and would play in Week 8, or that the Steelers would try to trade him, or that he would report to Pittsburgh after the Oct. 30 trade deadline. Now Week 9 is almost in the books, and until his cryptic tweet, Bell had shown that he would rather continue holding out than sign the franchise tag.\n\nAs he has waited, Bell has probably noticed that the Steelers have continued to play well, winning their fourth straight game Sunday, this time in Baltimore.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t spent a lot of time focused on [Bell\u2019s absence] because it\u2019s not within our control. Those decisions are Le\u2019Veon\u2019s,\u201d Pittsburgh Coach Mike Tomlin told ESPN\u2019s Dianna Russini. \u201cWe need volunteers, not hostages.\u201d\n\nSecond-year running back James Conner is one of those \u201cvolunteers,\u201d rushing for 743 yards and scoring nine touchdowns in Bell\u2019s absence. \u201cTaking nothing against James, the running of the football is an 11-man job,\u201d Tomlin said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a great belief in our offensive line. They\u2019re doing a great job opening holes for him. But to James\u2019s credit, he\u2019s running, catching, blocking, doing all the things we ask our feature runner to do.\u201d\n\n[John Clayton: The top 5 NFL MVP candidates at the halfway point, ranked]\n\nAs the Steelers improved to 5-2-1, Bell keeping his talents in South Beach rather than signing the franchise tag for a second straight season. The team could still place the transition tag on Bell after the season, a move that would allow it to match any offer sheet Bell might receive from another team. That would be worth between $9 million and $10 million, far less than his unsigned $14.5 million franchise tag.\n\nIf he is to play at all this season, he must report by Nov. 13, when Week 11 officially begins. Each week that passes with the franchise tag unsigned costs Bell another $855,000.\n\nIf Bell decides to return, Steelers players said they\u2019d look to Tomlin for cues on how to behave.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s his own personal battle,\u201d tackle Alejandro Villanueva said last week. \u201cNone of the players can really understand what he\u2019s going through. But at the same time, the one thing that is happening is we\u2019re playing football, we\u2019re trying to win, we have a chance this year to be a really good team.

They are favored to win 18 GOP seats, according to the Cook Political Report, and Republicans are favored to win two Democratic seats. That means Democrats would only need to win seven of the 30 seats that Cook rates as \u201ctoss-ups.\u201d This would seem likely even in a neutral environment, and history shows that these \u201ctoss-up\u201d races tend to go strongly in the direction of the party with the electoral momentum.\n\nWhat it would mean: If Democrats' House gain is somewhere in the neighborhood of 30 seats, that would be on a par with what often happens in midterm elections when the other party has the presidency. But it would be remarkable when you consider this: The GOP\u2019s redistricting advantage after the 2010 election was so huge that we wondered whether it was even possible that Democrats could win back the House. The median House district went for Trump by more than three points, even though he lost the popular vote by two points. If the map were anywhere close to neutral, and the environment were as it is, Democrats would be virtually guaranteed a House takeover right now. The fact that they are likely to win back a chamber that seemed so out of reach for the entire decade is big, in and of itself.\n\nRepublicans \u2014 and President Trump \u2014 would counter this by pointing out that they held the Senate or even gained seats (which is rare). But there, the map was even tougher, with Democrats defending 10 Trump states and Republicans defending only one won by Hillary Clinton. And a status quo election would actually set up Democrats very well to take over the chamber when they have much better opportunities in 2020 and 2022.\n\n2. A blue wave consumes the House, and the Senate is tight\n\nHow it would happen: Let\u2019s assume we\u2019re underselling the size of the blue wave. Let\u2019s assume the double-digit leads that Democrats used to have on the generic ballot (until recently) prevail on Election Day, and Americans vote Democratic by 10 or more points nationwide.\n\nIn that scenario, we\u2019d be talking about the vast majority of those 30 toss-ups going to the Democrats, along with potentially some upsets in districts Republicans are expected to hold. The gains would be north of 40 or 45 seats and give Democrats a substantial House majority \u2014 comparable to the GOP\u2019s current 42-seat majority.\n\nThat environment still might not be good enough to deliver the Senate, though. Republicans would probably lose Arizona and Nevada, the two swing seats they are defending, but they are clear favorites to unseat Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D) in North Dakota. That means the wave would have to deliver Democrats one more seat \u2014 a tough pickup in either Tennessee or Texas \u2014 and then help them hold everything else: Florida, Indiana, Missouri, Montana and West Virginia. All of those states are polling competitively, but it\u2019s not inconceivable that they\u2019d hold all four (Republicans hold a tiny lead in the polling average in only one of the four \u2014 Missouri).\n\nThe biggest question in this scenario is whether Democrats would actually be able to get Beto O\u2019Rourke across the finish line in Texas (where Democrats haven\u2019t won statewide in any race in a quarter-century) or pull an upset for the Tennessee open seat between Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R) and former governor Phil Bredesen (D), where the polling average has Blackburn up by five.\n\nWhat it would mean: This would be a clear repudiation of Trump, and there would be no other way to spin it. We can argue about the definition of \u201cwave,\u201d but 40-45 seats certainly qualifies, and Democrats would also likely have at least a 50-50 tie in the Senate (though Vice President Pence would still give the GOP control).\n\n3. Democrats somehow win both chambers, with the blue wave also consuming the Senate\n\nHow it would happen: This would be the really big wave \u2014 and it\u2019s not inconceivable. Projections gave Trump around a 1-in-6 shot at winning the presidency in 2016, and those are the odds FiveThirtyEight gives Democrats to win the Senate.\n\nThe likeliest outcome would seem to be Tennessee goes Democratic, and Texas possibly following it, giving Democrats a 51-49 or 52-48 majority in the Senate. The best possible outcome would include Democrats also holding North Dakota \u2014 and batting 1.000 on defense \u2014 and getting as much as a 53-47 Senate majority.\n\nWhat it would mean: Trump and the GOP losing both the House and the Senate would be a seismic shift, given the inherent advantage Republicans have on both maps. Immediately, talk would turn to how the 2016 election was perhaps a fluke and to how Trump\u2019s divisiveness had backfired. And it wouldn\u2019t be wrong.\n\n4. Republicans save the House and gain ground in the Senate\n\nHow it would happen: Speaking of small but substantial possibilities, that\u2019s what Republicans have when it comes to holding the House. FiveThirtyEight has them at a 1-in-8 shot.\n\nThis would require the House GOP holding the vast majority of those toss-up races, possibly because of rising enthusiasm from Trump\u2019s fear-infused, immigration-focused base strategy. And if those toss-up races tilted Republican in the House, you\u2019d think they\u2019d also tilt Republican in the Senate, where the terrain is even redder. It could result in states such as Nevada or even Arizona staying under GOP control and deliver states like Florida, Indiana, Missouri and Montana. Even if Republicans can just win red states, that could be a four- or five-seat gain.\n\nThe result would be the GOP maintaining control of all the levers of power in Washington and having more room for error in the Senate, with a 53-47, 54-46 or even 55-45 majority.\n\nWhat it would mean: Pundit chaos. It would suggest \u2014 again \u2014 that polls might be underselling Trump\u2019s actual base of support and that we continue to fundamentally misunderstand what he\u2019s doing to our political coalitions. It wouldn\u2019t necessarily be a resounding affirmation of Trump \u2014 these are only red states the GOP would be winning \u2014 but it would lead to some real, justified soul-searching.\n\n5. A wild card\n\nHow it would happen: The idea that we might continue to fundamentally misunderstand the country\u2019s political zeitgeist \u2014 combined with the 2016 election \u2014 mean there could be something completely unexpected. Maybe the GOP narrowly holds the House, but Democrats keep the Senate close. Maybe Democrats win the House, but Republicans pick up a few Senate seats. Maybe Democrats pull a shocker in Tennessee and/or Texas but lose supposedly easier states.\n\nThere are simply so many toss-ups \u2014 30 in the House and nine in the Senate \u2014 that weird things can happen. It\u2019s really difficult to rule anything out, given we\u2019re in uncharted territory here, and that all of our previous assumptions about how these things work have been called into question. The safest bet is not to assume everything happens as neatly as you expect they will.\n\nWhat it would mean: The same as above \u2014 chaos \u2014 except less specifically partisan. The arguments about exactly what the election meant would be all over the place, and it would be tough to say anything with certainty, because we\u2019d be entering a bona fide new political reality.\n\n[Q&A: What midterm races do you want to know more about?

(James Cheadle/Alamy) (James cheadle / Alamy Stock Photo/Alamy Stock Photo)\n\nIt\u2019s not that hard to find the Infowars articles that Jewish groups worry about.\n\nA quick search of the site pulls up an article suggesting the U.S. government perpetrated the recent attack on the Pittsburgh synagogue as a false flag operation. (It\u2019s the \u201clatest move by the Deep State to sow civil unrest and effect [sic] the historic upcoming midterm election,\u201d the site\u2019s authors write.) There\u2019s one calling Jewish philanthropist George Soros a \u201cNazi collaborator\u201d \u2014 and dozens of others accusing him of funding a migrant caravan in Mexico and attacks on Supreme Court justice Brett M. Kavanaugh. That\u2019s just in the last few weeks.\n\nJewish leaders in Britain say the site \u2014 which regularly uses words such as \u201cglobalist,\u201d a term the Israeli newspaper Haaretz calls an anti-Semitic slur and \u201cdog whistle\u201d for white supremacists \u2014 is biased against Jews. Now, some are calling on the U.K. Independence Party (UKIP) to cut ties with the website.\n\nUKIP is the far-right, Euroskeptic party responsible for pushing Britain\u2019s 2016 Brexit referendum, in which a narrow majority of voters chose to leave the European Union. Last summer, the party allowed Paul Joseph Watson, an \u201ceditor at large\u201d for Infowars, to join the party. He campaigned for the group, particularly among younger voters on social media. A support video he made was featured prominently on the organization\u2019s website. (Another person brought in to sell UKIP was Mark Meechan, fined earlier this year for posting a video of his girlfriend\u2019s dog giving Nazi salutes in response to phrases including \u201cgas the Jews.\")\n\nJewish groups said they are concerned about UKIP\u2019s connection to Watson and Infowars. A spokesman for the Board of Deputies of British Jews told the Guardian newspaper that Infowars is \u201cpropagating conspiracy theories and dog-whistle antisemitism.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe call on the party leadership to publicly and unequivocally disassociate themselves from these views and to expel any members who are found to hold them,\" he said.\n\n\u201cThe seepage of anti-Semitism and conspiracy theories into mainstream politics encourages hatred and undermines democracy,\" a spokesman for the Community Security Trust (CST), which works against anti-Semitism in the United Kingdom, told the Guardian. \"Rather than shunning these dangers, UKIP appears to be embracing them; and in the process is losing any claim it once had to be a respectable, mainstream party.\u201d\n\nJohn Mann, a Labour Party politician who chairs the British parliamentary group against anti-Semitism, called Infowars \u201cvile and dangerous.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn a climate of political uncertainty, conspiracy theories have been rising in popularity. Infowars is notorious for its part in feeding such conspiracies and at the root of many, if not all, of these myths is a hatred and suspicion of Jews,\" he told the Guardian. \"Any party serious about tackling antisemitism and racism would do well to cut all ties with Infowars.\u201d\n\nInfowars founder Alex Jones has repeatedly attacked his critics for calling him anti-Semitic. Watson has avoided publicly endorsing many of Jones\u2019s most far-fetched conspiracy theories.\n\n\u201cWatson is frequently the subject of attacks by actual anti-Semites because of his vociferous support for Israel. He is no more responsible for the comments of Alex Jones than Andrew Neil is for the comments of the director general of the BBC,\u201d a spokesman for UKIP told the Guardian. \u201cThis line of questioning, built on cynical supposition and innuendo, is a clumsy attempt to smear Mr. Watson and UKIP for political gain.

Kavanaugh took part in the net neutrality case as a judge in a lower court and recused himself from it now that he's on the high court. (Andrew Harnik/Pool/AP)\n\nThe Supreme Court said Monday that it will not hear a closely watched case over the future of the Internet \u2014 rejecting a petition by telecom industry groups to consider net neutrality, the principle that Internet providers should treat all online content equally.\n\nThree of the justices \u2014 Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil M. Gorsuch \u2014 would have voted to take up the case, according to the court\u2019s announcement, and wipe off the books a lower court\u2019s decision backing the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s net neutrality rules, which were originally passed in 2015. But there were not enough justices for a majority, after Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh recused themselves. (Roberts\u2019s financial disclosures for last year showed that he owned stock in Time Warner, a company now owned by AT&T under the name WarnerMedia, while Kavanaugh took part in the case as a judge in the lower court.)\n\nAs a result, the decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit stands. That opinion, in 2016, held that the FCC had acted within its powers when it approved sweeping new rules the year before that imposed new obligations on Internet providers such as AT&T, Comcast and Verizon.\n\nThe FCC rules forbade carriers from blocking or slowing websites, and also prohibited them from offering websites faster delivery to consumers in exchange for new, additional fees. Providers complained that the rules were overly burdensome and a violation of the FCC\u2019s congressionally granted powers; consumer advocates said the rules were necessary as a vital consumer protection. The D.C. Circuit upheld the regulations, prompting industry groups to escalate the case to the Supreme Court.\n\nBut even as the Supreme Court was weighing whether to take up the appeal, the FCC under Republican chairman Ajit Pai moved to rescind those very rules. The new FCC in 2017 voted to reject much of its authority over Internet providers, and handed much of the responsibility for net neutrality to a sister agency, the Federal Trade Commission. The repeal went into effect this summer.\n\nThe GOP-led effort to repeal the FCC\u2019s net neutrality rules set off a separate round of litigation, as tech companies and consumer groups sued to block the deregulation. That suit, which is also pending before the D.C. Circuit, is quickly becoming the center of the legal battle over net neutrality now, with the Supreme Court deciding not to hear its net neutrality case. The Justice Department has also agreed to suspend its recent suit against California over the state\u2019s new net neutrality law, at least until the case before the D.C. Circuit is resolved.\n\nInternet providers who had petitioned the Supreme Court said they support an open Internet.\n\n\u201cRather than back-and-forth regulations and lengthy court proceedings, now is the time for Congress to enact bipartisan legislation and resolve this issue once and for all,\u201d said CTIA, the wireless industry\u2019s top trade association in Washington.\n\nSupporters of the now-defunct FCC rules say the Supreme Court\u2019s decision not to hear the industry appeal bolsters their current litigation before the D.C. Circuit. Since the lower court had ruled in favor of the regulations, the opinion helps back up the case against the FCC repeal, according to John Bergmayer, senior counsel at Public Knowledge, a consumer advocacy organization.\n\n\u201cThis means that the previous decision is binding on the current FCC and on the D.C. Circuit panel that hears the current challenge,\u201d Bergmayer said.", "In this photo provided by Egypt\u2019s state news agency MENA, Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, speaks during a youth conference in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, Monday, Nov. 5, 2018. Addressing the international youth conference late Sunday el-Sissi said that the 2011 Arab Spring revolt was an ill-advised attempt at change whose chaotic aftermath posed an existential threat to the nation. Egypt\u2019s president said those behind the revolt had good intentions but had inadvertently \u201copened the gates of hell.\u201d (MENA via AP) (Associated Press)\n\nCAIRO \u2014 Egypt\u2019s president has said his country\u2019s 2011 Arab Spring revolt was an ill-advised attempt at change whose chaotic aftermath posed an existential threat to the nation.\n\nAddressing an international youth conference late Sunday, Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi said those behind the revolt had good intentions but had inadvertently \u201copened the gates of hell.\u201d\n\nEl-Sissi had until recently only hinted at his disapproval of the uprising that ended the 29-year rule of autocrat Hosni Mubarak. In his first outright criticism of the uprising, he said last month it was the \u201cwrong remedy that followed a wrong diagnosis.\u201d\n\nBut his comments at the youth forum provided his most detailed assessment of the uprising, which pro-government media routinely demonize as a foreign conspiracy to destroy the country.\n\nThe 2011 uprising was led by young, pro-democracy activists, and paved the way for Egypt\u2019s first free and fair elections, which were won by the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist group whose stalwart Mohammed Morsi was elected president in 2012. His rule proved divisive, and in 2013 el-Sissi, as defense minister, led the military overthrow of Morsi amid mass protests.\n\nSince then, the government has waged an unprecedented crackdown on dissent, jailing thousands of Islamists along with some of the most prominent activists behind the 2011 uprising. Authorities have rolled back all the freedoms gained through the uprising, banning unauthorized protests and silencing most independent media. El-Sissi was re-elected earlier this year in a vote in which all potentially viable opponents were either jailed or withdrew under pressure.\n\nHe has defended his actions by saying they spared Egypt the fate of Syria, Yemen and Libya, where Arab Spring uprisings led to civil war.\n\nOn Sunday, he said the uprising created a \u201cmassive vacuum that only the evil people can fill\u201d and warned against a repeat. He said Egyptians and others in the region would be better off under \u201cnot so good\u201d rulers than living through chaos.\n\n\u201cWork, be patient, endure and suffer under the reality that you disapprove of, but don\u2019t ruin your countries because they will never return to what they once were,\u201d he warned.\n\nSince taking office, el-Sissi has slashed costly state subsidies on basic goods and introduced new taxes while spending billions of dollars on infrastructure projects. His economic reforms helped Egypt secure $12 billion in bailout loans from the International Monetary Fund, but have caused a steep rise in the prices of food, fuel and services.\n\n\u201cAfter all the effort we have done, all that we are hoping for is that we go back to where we were before 2011,\u201d he said.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Amanda Voisard/Austin American-Statesman via AP)\n\nOpinion writer\n\nThe Post/ABC News poll shows Democrats with a 50 percent to 43 percent lead in the generic congressional poll among registered voters and a similar 51 to 44 percent lead among likely voters. Those figures are nearly identical to the NBC/Wall Street Journal poll (50/43 among likely voters). Combined with polling in specific competitive House races, Democrats seem headed for a pickup in the neighborhood of 35 seats.\n\nA huge caveat should come with these numbers \u2014 and with the near-certainty with which prognosticators are predicting Republicans will hold the Senate. It\u2019s not clear why they are so confident of the results, given that only one incumbent Democrat, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, is in serious trouble and a slew of races are within the margin of error.\n\nAs the Cook Political Report\u2019s Jennifer Duffy points out, there is a \u201cbig possibility\u201d Democrats flip Texas and/or Tennessee. In Texas, \u201cThere has been real momentum around the [Beto] O\u2019Rourke campaign, especially over the last couple weeks,\u201d MSNBC\u2019s Garrett Haake reports. \u201cHe\u2019s been drawing these big, diverse crowds all over the state.

And his campaign is buoyed by these get out the early vote numbers, which have been extraordinary in Texas.\u201d\n\nAdding to the uncertainty, early voting turnout has been off the charts, and there has been a sizable uptick among younger voters. The \u201clikely\u201d voter screens may be of little use \u2014 or may even be misleading. A lot of \u201cunlikely\u201d voters may have already voted or will vote Tuesday.\n\nA look at the demographic and gender breakdown of the polls should deeply worry Republicans. The NBC/Wall Street Journal poll shows that whites with college degrees favor Democrats by 19 points (56-37), white women with college degrees favor Democrats by 28 points (61-33), and women overall favor Democrats by 18 points (55-37). The Post/ABC poll likewise shows whites with college degrees favor Democrats by 14 points (54-40), while white women with college degrees favor Democrats by 16 points (54-38).\n\nA final factor heightens the uncertainty. In Florida (where a Senate and multiple House races are up for grabs) and Georgia (where two Republican-held seats are in play) gubernatorial races, each featuring dynamic African American Democrats, are driving turnout and possibly changing the composition of the electorate. Stacey Abrams, the Democrat running for governor in Georgia, seeks to be the first female African American governor in U.S. history. She had this exchange on \u201cMeet the Press\u201c:\n\nSTACEY ABRAMS: We have seen unprecedented turnout in this race from people who normally do not engage and do not vote. Some of that has been driven by the conversations of voter suppression. Because one of the best ways to encourage people to use something is to tell them that someone\u2019s trying to take it away. Luckily, we\u2019ve had two court decisions against Brian Kemp, one that requires that absentee ballots be counted even if the signatures aren\u2019t exactly the same and a second one that forces him to stop using the exact match system to disqualify voters who are qualified . . . CHUCK TODD: The president\u2019s going to be in Macon, Georgia today. He said you just simply weren\u2019t qualified to be governor. He didn\u2019t say why. How did you take that assessment? STACEY ABRAMS: I find his assessments to be vapid and shallow. I am the most qualified candidate. I am a business owner. I\u2019m a tax attorney who has trained at Yale Law School. I am a civic leader who helped to register more than 200,000 Georgians. I am a very accomplished political leader who worked across the aisle to improve access to education, to transportation. And I blocked the single-largest tax increase in Georgia history. There is no one more qualified standing for this office in Georgia. And I look forward to having the voters of Georgia say the same . . . CHUCK TODD: You know, one of the things it seems to me, this has been a very bitter campaign. You\u2019ve called your opponent a liar. He\u2019s used some harsh language. If you win, you\u2019re going to have a very large Republican majority in the Georgia legislature. Yes, maybe Democrats make a few gains there. But you\u2019re going to be dealing with a Republican legislature. You have to work across the aisle if you\u2019re going to accomplish anything. How do you repair this divide? It\u2019s, let\u2019s be honest. You know it\u2019s, it feels worse than ever. How are you going to try to do this? STACEY ABRAMS: Number one, I\u2019ve run this campaign going to every single part of the state. I have not ignored a single community or county because I believe that my job is to speak to every single voter. Number two, if you look at the issues I talk about, education, high-class education for everyone, access to health care in every community, and making sure that we have good-paying jobs, this cuts across partisanship. But most importantly, I can stand on my record. I was the leader of Democrats in a majority-Republican legislature. And I was able to work across the aisle and get good done. We can disagree on principles, but we have a common responsibility to Georgians. And I\u2019ve always said, \u201cPeople don\u2019t care about your party. They care about their lives.\u201d And as the next governor, my goal is going to be to bring everyone together to solve the problems we can solve together. Certainly leading with my values: faith, and family, and service. But recognizing that everyone comes to the table as a Georgian and we have to work together.\n\nShe has been able, as has Andrew Gillum in Florida, to crank up enthusiasm among nonwhite voters without alienating moderates in the suburbs. They, and perhaps the Democrats more generally, have figured out that they can grow and electrify the base at the same time they can take in independents and Republicans fleeing from Trump\u2019s noxious brand of nativism.

He became a national symbol of the Communist era\u2019s brutality against its own people, most of whom who had simply fallen afoul of the regime.\n\nRomania had about 500,000 political prisoners under the Communist regime that was in power from 1947 until 1989, about one-fifth of whom died while in detention, according to historians.\n\nVisinescu died Monday at Rahova prison hospital, Bianca Filote, a spokeswoman for the Institute for Investigating the Crimes of Communism, told The Associated Press.\n\n\u201cHe will forever be known as the torturer adopted by the communist Securitate secret police to kill. He ended the lives of defenseless human beings, physically and mentally,\u201d Andrei Muraru, who initiated the investigation into Visinescu\u2019s conduct in 2013, told the AP.\n\nVisinescu was convicted in 2015 for the abuse and killing of prisoners at Ramnicu Sarat prison in eastern Romania, where he was in command from 1956 to 1963. He was imprisoned in February 2016 after losing his appeal.\n\nFormer prisoners under Visinescu testified that they were denied access to medical treatment, heating, exercise and adequate food. They were held in solitary confinement and beatings were common.

That\u2019s true, but what\u2019s really on the ballot is the Trumpist GOP\u2019s fusion of xenophobic ethno-nationalism with the GOP\u2019s orthodox regressive plutocratic agenda.\n\nThat latter element also comprises Trump\u2019s ongoing corruption and self-dealing \u2014 we still have no idea how much Trump personally profited off the GOP tax cut \u2014 which Republicans are openly signaling that a GOP House will allow to continue undisturbed. It seems crazy that the straight-up declaration that Republicans will protect Trump and his administration from accountability and scrutiny would be seen as a positive that energizes Republican voters. But that\u2019s where the Trump-era GOP has taken us, and this perversity, too, is very much on the ballot on Tuesday.\n\nMany of the lies that sustain this fusion were on display during Trump\u2019s final rallies in Georgia and Tennessee. Trump falsely claimed that Democrats favor open borders and are behind the Central American migrants working their way through Mexico. He falsely claimed that Democrats are the ones who will take away people\u2019s health care. He falsely claimed that Democrats want to obliterate Medicare, and that he\u2019s the one who wants to protect Social Security from cuts.\n\nThis is in keeping with the endless lies that Trump has employed to hype the migrant \u201ccaravan\u201d into a national emergency. Republicans are running ads across the country painting immigrants as criminal invaders alongside many others that traffic in undisguised race-baiting directed at specific Democratic candidates who happen to be nonwhite.\n\nRepublicans are also relentlessly \u2014 and falsely \u2014 claiming they are the ones who will protect people with preexisting conditions. GOP-aligned groups have been falsely claiming that Democrats want to cut hundreds of billions from Medicare, recycling a lie from previous election cycles. Trump has also been claiming that if Republicans win the elections, they\u2019ll immediately push through a massive tax cut for the middle class, which is almost certainly complete nonsense. Republican candidates have been falsely claiming that the GOP tax cut paid for itself.\n\nIt\u2019s useful to separate the lies into different buckets. The lying about immigration and the relentless race-baiting on one side, and the lying about Medicare and Social Security on the other, in a sense reinforce one another. Both are about frightening old people \u2014 that is, the aging white GOP base.\n\nBy contrast, the lying about immigration on one side, and the lying about health care and taxes on the other, are working at cross purposes with one another. In this regard, a deep split has opened up in GOP messaging. The immigrant-bashing and race-baiting messaging is about galvanizing the GOP\u2019s blue-collar white base in red-state Senate races, and about limiting GOP losses in the House by energizing that base in redder districts.\n\nMeanwhile, in the messaging directed at suburban areas where the most competitive House races are unfolding and control will likely be decided, the hardcore immigration talk is much quieter, even as Republicans are employing the lies about health care and taxes to hold onto suburban and educated whites who are alienated by Trump\u2019s misogyny, racism and cruel ethno-nationalist agenda.\n\nIndeed, Politico reports that many Republicans now fear that Trump\u2019s strategy of closing on hate-mongering and xenophobia could cost them the House:\n\nThey now fear Trump went overboard \u2014 and that it could cost them dearly in key suburban districts, from Illinois to Texas. Many of them have cringed at Trump\u2019s threats to unilaterally end birthright citizenship, as well as his recent racially-tinged ad suggesting that immigrants are police killers. The president\u2019s drumbeat, they say, is drowning out news any incumbent president would be negligent not to dwell on: that the economy added a quarter-million jobs last quarter, and unemployment is below 4 percent.\n\nWe have to hope that these Republicans are right to worry. The race still appears close: The Democrats\u2019 generic-ballot lead stands at just over eight points, which is barely outside what might be needed to overcome GOP structural advantages such as gerrymandering and geographic sorting. The final Upshot-Siena polls seem to offer good news for Democrats, but numerous hard-fought races that will decide control of the House could tip either way.\n\nDefeat the lies\n\nThe more obvious reason to hope that all the Trump/GOP lies get repudiated is that validation of them as a successful campaign strategy would be a terrible outcome. This wouldn\u2019t just encourage future GOP campaigns to double down on stoking xenophobic and racial panic. It\u2019s worse: The Trump strategy of sending in troops to prop up the campaign fiction that migrants pose a national emergency is a serious act of official misconduct.\n\nThis goes beyond Trump: Republicans are largely all in with this move. Meanwhile, Brian Kemp, the GOP candidate in the Georgia gubernatorial race, is now using his position overseeing the election as secretary of state to investigate Democrats for allegedly \u201chacking\u201d the voter registration system with no evidence. The terrible precedent that such brazen abuses of governmental power to manipulate electoral outcomes will set for future elections seems obvious on its face.\n\nThe other reason to hope that all these lies get repudiated is centered on the very truths they are designed to obscure \u2014 that is, on the actual stakes in this election that all the lies are designed to cover up. If Republicans hold the House, Trump \u2014 having closed on xenophobia and hate \u2014 will be emboldened to go harder into his ethno-nationalist agenda: more restrictions on asylum seekers; a revived version of the family separations; possibly even an effort at an executive order to force a court battle over birthright citizenship.\n\nOn top of that, the GOP lies about preexisting conditions are designed to conceal the fact that if they win, Republicans will try again to repeal the Affordable Care Act. They very likely will try to cut entitlements as well, or if not, they\u2019ll try to deeply slash other safety-net programs.\n\nA Democratic House would hold out at least the possibility of negotiations on saner immigration solutions and compromises, and would halt the drive to repeal Obamacare. It could mean accountability in the form of an effort to get Trump\u2019s tax returns. (Republicans have openly said voters should support them to prevent such accountability.) It could also mean congressional hearings into Trump\u2019s use of the military for political purposes, and into Trump\u2019s governing fiascoes, such as the administration\u2019s bad-faith-saturated immigration cruelties and health-care sabotage.\n\nIf Republicans hold the House, it means unshackled Trumpian ethno-nationalism and personal self-dealing, a validation of xenophobic panic and naked authoritarian abuses for campaign purposes, and more plutocracy and inequality. If Democrats win the House, it will mean the beginnings of a real check on those things. The only way the latter will happen is if those who dread unchecked Trumpism vote in large enough numbers to make the latter a reality.\n\nRelated:\n\nRead more:\n\nJennifer Rubin: The polls tell us something but not everything\n\nE.J.

(Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post)\n\nA look at the good (Hail!) and bad (Fail!) from the Redskins' 38-14 loss to the Falcons on Sunday at FedEx Field.\n\nHail: The Fade\n\nYears from now, if Redskins fans remember anything about Sunday\u2019s forgettable blowout loss, it\u2019ll likely be where they were when Alex Smith and Josh Doctson connected for a two-yard touchdown pass on a perfectly thrown fade. Given Adrian Peterson\u2019s effectiveness at punching in short-yardage touchdowns this season, the fade hadn\u2019t been a focal point of the Redskins' goal-line offense, but it was only a matter of time before Redskins Coach Jay Gruden revived his passion project.\n\n\u201cYeah, we tried it three times, and we\u2019ll try it again three times next week if we have to,\u201d Gruden told Sonny Jurgensen after a loss to the Cowboys in September 2016.\n\n\u201cI do like to have bigger receivers in the red zone here and there to be able to throw some fades, too,\u201d Gruden said last August. \u201cWhat the heck, you know, I love the fade.\u201d\n\n\"Just watch the games and enjoy it,\u201d Gruden said in response to a question about another failed fade pass in the end zone early last season. \u201cI mean, we\u2019re gonna throw the fade again. I\u2019m gonna throw it again. So tough.\u201d\n\nGruden is a man of his word. While it may have seemed like it, Doctson\u2019s touchdown catch wasn\u2019t the first time the fade worked under Gruden. Kirk Cousins and Pierre Garcon connected on a fade route for a 15-yard touchdown in a win over the Eagles in December 2016.\n\nFail: Doctson\u2019s Drops\n\nDoctson has demonstrated an ability to make difficult catches in traffic, as he did for the aforementioned touchdown and in the third quarter with a leaping, 24-yard grab along the sideline. He finished with three catches for 31 yards, but he also derailed Washington\u2019s second drive by dropping a pair of passes that hit him directly in the hands in the span of three snaps. Unless and until Doctson becomes a more consistent and reliable contributor on offense, he\u2019ll be considered a bust. A wide receiver selected in the first round should do more than make a tough catch or two every few games.\n\nHail: Maurice Harris\n\nWhile Doctson had his struggles, undrafted Maurice Harris quietly had a career day, with 10 catches for 124 yards on 12 targets. The third-year pro out of Cal, who has taken on a larger role in the offense with Jamison Crowder and Paul Richardson Jr. in and out of the lineup due to injuries, came into the game with 11 catches for 102 yards.\n\nFail: Third-Down Defense\n\nThe Falcons converted only two of their five third downs in the second half, which was below their season average of 50 percent coming into the game. Of course, one of those conversions was a 35-yard touchdown pass to Julio Jones that iced the game, and Atlanta converted all eight of its third downs in the first two quarters. The Falcons converted 10 of their 13 third downs on the day.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been a joke on third down,\u201d Gruden reportedly told Fox sideline reporter Pam Oliver at halftime, and he wasn\u2019t making a pun about Washington\u2019s recent trade for safety Ha Ha Clinton-Dix.\n\nSince 1991, which is as far back as Pro Football Reference\u2019s third-down conversion stats go, the Redskins allowed an opponent to convert 75 percent or more of their third downs only one other time before Sunday. In a 41-7 loss to the Giants on Oct. 10, 1993, New York was successful on nine of its 12 third downs. Sunday was the 15th time since 1991 that Washington allowed at least 10 third-down conversions in a game and the first time since a 31-23 loss to the Cardinals in December 2016.\n\nHail: Scoring in the Third Quarter\n\nJones\u2019s touchdown catch in the fourth quarter marked the first time the Falcons' star wide receiver found the end zone since Week 12 of last season. That wasn\u2019t the only preposterous streak to come to an end Sunday. When Kapri Bibbs capped a 77-yard drive with a three-yard run late in the third quarter, it gave the Redskins their first third quarter touchdown since last Thanksgiving.\n\n\ud83d\udea8The #Redskins have scored a third-quarter touchdown for the first time in 13 games.\ud83d\udea8 \u2014 Jake Russell (@_JakeRussell) November 4, 2018\n\nFail: Penalties\n\nThe Redskins committed 10 penalties for 147 yards.\n\n\u201cA hundred what?\u201d Adrian Peterson asked after the game.\n\nForty-seven. One. Hundred. Forty. Seven.\n\n\u201cSome of the penalties were bulls--- though, for sure,\u201d Redskins safety D.J. Swearinger said.\n\nI assure you that most of them were not.\n\nForty-seven of those penalty yards came on one pass interference call against Josh Norman, who made a diving tackle of Jones before the ball arrived. Offensive holding was the Redskins' preferred infraction, and they even managed to screw that up; on one play in the second half, the Falcons declined two separate holding penalties on the Redskins because they sacked Smith anyway. Doctson was flagged for taunting after spinning the ball along the Atlanta sideline following a catch with Washington trailing 28-7. Morgan Moses earned an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty for jawing at an official during a stoppage in play.\n\nYou have to go back to 1971 to find the last time the Redskins accrued more penalty yards in a single game. Somewhat surprisingly, Washington blew out the Giants, 30-3, in that flag fest, despite racking up 178 yards on 15 penalties.\n\n\u201cI do not like penalties, but I would rather be aggressive and get penalties than not be aggressive and not get penalties,\u201d Redskins Coach George Allen said after his team had more penalty yards than yards allowed (156) in a game that featured several skirmishes.\n\nThe Redskins were 2-0-1 in their previous three games when they committed at least 10 penalties dating back to October 2015, but their lack of discipline was too much to overcome against the Falcons.\n\nHail: Houdini Alex Smith\n\nSmith completed 30 of 46 passes for 306 yards, but his most impressive feat of the game was a 22-yard scramble that set up Washington\u2019s first touchdown. In a play reminiscent of Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz\u2019s escape act against the Redskins last season, Smith spun out of the grasp of three Falcons defenders before turning an apparent sack into a big gain. Perhaps emboldened by his Houdini-like moves that sparked the play, Smith ended the run by attempting to cut back toward the middle of the field instead of stepping out of bounds. There was no avoiding the crushing blow that Falcons cornerback Brian Poole laid on him after that unfortunate decision.\n\n\u201c@Redskins QB Alex Smith is legally contacted in #ATLvsWAS: the defender tackles with his head out, shoulder in.

The Redskins were already without left tackle Trent Williams. By the end of the game, Shawn Lauvao (knee) and Brandon Scherff (shoulder) had both joined Williams on the injury report. They\u2019re scheduled to undergo MRIs on Monday. Moses also suffered a knee injury Sunday, but would later return to the game. It\u2019s beginning to feel a lot like 2017, when injuries along the offensive line helped spoil the season.\n\nRead more on the Redskins:\n\nRedskins' winning streak ends with ugly, injury-riddled loss to the Falcons\n\nBeaten up and beaten bad, the Redskins are still 5-3 but face some tough questions\n\nRedskins-Falcons takeaways: Injuries, penalties lead to a bad loss for Washington\n\nBy choosing building blocks over playmakers, Redskins created a big imbalance\n\nRedskins lose two more offensive linemen to injuries\n\nRedskins' defense gets dominated in loss to Falcons: \u2018They went to work on us\u2019", "\n\nThe \"New Nature\" exhibition at Artechouse encourages visitors to interact with the art.

(Jewel Samad/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nSunday marked the 10th anniversary of Election Day 2008, the day voters elected Barack Obama the first black American to be president.\n\nSince then, identity politics, the idea that an individual\u2019s various identities shape how they view politics and policies, went from being a little-known concept, often bemoaned by those on the right, to the central method that both political parties use to rally their bases to the polls.\n\nAs appeals to \u201cone nation\u201d appear to have decreased at the highest levels of governments, they have been replaced with an awareness that gender, race, faith, socioeconomic status and region very much determine how likely one is to experience \u201cthe American dream.\u201d\n\nIdentity politics did not begin with the Obama era. But the current political climate, where it has become a central part of U.S. politics is certainly in part a response to the Obama presidency. Less than 50 years after the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which made it illegal to bar Americans from voting based on race, the majority of voters decided that the person most capable of shaping the United States into a more perfect union was the biracial son of a Kenyan man and a white American woman with roots in the heartland.\n\nFrom the earliest days of the 2008 campaign, Obama\u2019s \u201cotherness\u201d became a huge issue in his race against Sen. John McCain, the Arizonan and celebrated war hero who was his Republican opponent. That \u201cotherness\u201d confirmed the belief that many of the identity politics that were present at the formation of the United States remained key in shaping how some Americans vote. Some outwardly questioned whether a man who was not white and whose father was born into a Muslim family in east Africa could heal the racial, religious and cultural divides that for years led so many Americans to disconnect from the political process.\n\nWhen Obama greeted supporters in Chicago on election night, he opened his speech by saying this: \u201cIf there is anyone out there who still doubts that America is a place where all things are possible, who still wonders if the dream of our founders is alive in our time, who still questions the power of our democracy, tonight is your answer.\u201d\n\nJust a decade later in a political climate in which Obama\u2019s secretary of state Hillary Clinton was defeated after she promised to expand upon the agenda he set, many of his supporters feel that dream has been replaced by a nightmare.\n\nObama\u2019s successor, President Trump, a former reality television star, entered politics by making regular appearances on Fox News, opining on all things political. He spread the falsehood that Obama was not born in the United States, and questioned Obama\u2019s ability to govern a country where much of the electorate looked more like his maternal grandparents than his African ancestors.\n\n\u201cIn this country, we rise or fall as one nation, as one people. Let\u2019s resist the temptation to fall back on the same partisanship and pettiness and immaturity that has poisoned our politics for so long,\u201d Obama said on election night 2008.\n\nBut just two elections later, it is partisanship that perhaps shapes how Americans engage politics more than ever. To his critics, this is in part Obama\u2019s fault. His sympathizing with black Americans' concerns about police brutality and his liberal stances on LGBT issues and birth control certainly drew more criticism than praise from Americans who not only disagreed with his positions, but simply could not relate to people who viewed these issues so differently. Many conservative Americans who believed they were being dismissed as clinging to their deeply held religious convictions and Second Amendment rights saw a president whose attraction to change could move the country in a direction at odds with many of its richest traditions.\n\nAnd perhaps as a result, the 2016 race to succeed Obama was a fight over which tribes would hold the most power in the Oval Office \u2014 or at the very least not be ignored and forgotten. The 2018 midterms are a continuation of that fight.\n\nVoters have broken records across the country already as they head to the polls for early voting to determine the direction in which America will move. Will voters turn out to back Trump\u2019s revived campaign methods, affirming the fears of his base who remain anxious about the country\u2019s cultural changes? Or will more voters back the Democratic Party and its argument that America\u2019s most forgotten people are those whose demographic groups are less well-represented in Washington\u2019s halls of power?\n\nWe will know soon and with that revelation we will all have a better idea of not only the America we will soon become, but the America that we are.", "The federal government is continuing to study Silicon Valley giants for potential violations of antitrust law, according to President Trump, in his latest criticism of the embattled tech industry.\n\n\u201cI am in charge,\u201d he said in an interview with Axios that aired Sunday on HBO. \u201cI am definitely in charge, and we are certainly looking at it.\u201d\n\nAsked by Axios to clarify which companies the Trump administration is considering, Trump said: \u201cAll three\u201d \u2014 referring to Amazon.com, Facebook and Google.\n\n(Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P.

But while the Federal Trade Commission had investigated Google during the Obama administration over how the company displayed its search results, the agency concluded there was no antitrust violation \u2014 and did not weigh a break up.\n\nSome, such as Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), have called on the FTC to reopen its probe into Google.\n\n[Sen. Orrin Hatch wants the FTC to investigate Google]\n\nIn September, the Justice Department held a meeting with state attorneys general to discuss whether any conduct by the tech companies could have violated antitrust law.

Eventually, the rat excretes the worms.\n\nSnails or slugs can become infected by eating the rat\u2019s feces, according to the CDC, and people can become infected by eating the snails or slugs.\n\nAccording to the CDC:\n\nPeople can get infected by eating raw or undercooked snails or slugs that are infected with this parasite. In some cultures, snails are commonly eaten. Some children, in particular, have gotten infected by swallowing snails/slugs \u201con a dare. \u201d People also can get infected by accident, by eating raw produce (such as lettuce) that contains a small snail or slug or part of one. Certain animals such freshwater shrimp, crabs, or frogs, have been found to be infected with larvae of the parasite. It is possible that eating undercooked or raw animals that are infected could result in people becoming infected, though the evidence for this is not as clear as for eating infected snails and slugs. Of note, fish do not spread this parasite.\n\nCases have been reported in Hawaii, as well as in the continental United States, according to the CDC. A New Orleans boy contracted the parasite in 1993 by eating a snail \u201con a dare,\u201d according to the agency, but did not need treatment.\n\nAustralian health officials have called it \u201can extremely rare infection.\u201d\n\nThe New South Wales Ministry of Health said in a fact sheet that most people who contract it do not experience any symptoms; when they do, the symptoms are usually temporary and mild, the health agency said.\n\nAccording to the ministry:\n\nVery rarely, rat lung worm causes an infection (infestation) of the brain called eosinophilic meningo-encephalitis. People with this condition may have headaches, a stiff neck, tingling or pain in the skin, fever, nausea, and vomiting. The time between eating the slug or snail and getting sick is usually 1-3 weeks. Anyone with these symptoms should seek medical assessment although other infections (such as meningococcal disease or pneumococcal disease) are much more likely causes of meningitis in children.\n\nHealth officials warn people not to eat raw snails or slugs and to thoroughly wash fruits and vegetables and inspect them for the slimy creatures.\n\nRead more:\n\n\u2018Like someone stuck an ice pick in my collarbone\u2019: Painful rat lungworm disease on upswing in Hawaii", "\n\nVoters enter the Hamilton County Board of Elections on the first day of early voting on Oct. 10 in Cincinnati. (John Minchillo/AP)\n\nImagine reading a narrative in which the main characters are underdeveloped. Their choices are dictated by others. They are not given much dialogue. When they are described in detail, they are labeled as \u201cuninformed\u201d or \u201ctroubled.\u201d This story line represents how voters have been treated in news coverage of elections since the early 1970s.\n\nMy new book, \u201cVotes That Count and Voters Who Don\u2019t: How Journalists Sideline Electoral Participation (Without Even Knowing It),\u201d shows how voters have been devalued in the news for 50 years. It reveals how such coverage may unintentionally depress people\u2019s desire to vote and increase their anger at the media.\n\nMy research also shows this is can be changed. Here\u2019s why.\n\nHow the research was conducted\n\nThe project began with an analysis of how 36,400 instances of the words vote(s), voter(s) and voting were portrayed in six major newspapers spanning the 18 presidential campaigns between 1948 and 2016.\n\nThe project also included an experiment and focus groups testing how people respond to various portrayals as well as interviews with over 50 reporters to learn more about why journalists write the stories they do.\n\nHow elections used to be covered\n\nJournalists regard elections to be important. They admit, though, that they struggle while reporting on them.\n\nTake coverage in the 1948 presidential contest. The Chicago Tribune could not wait for the ballots to be counted before famously and falsely identifying Republican Thomas Dewey as the victor over Democrat Harry Truman. Shaken by this error, journalists in the 1950s and 1960s were cautious in their reporting on polls and their forecasting of election results.\n\nIntriguingly, however, when polls didn\u2019t drive the news narrative, depictions of electoral participation signaled considerable power to the electorate. In particular, the term \u201cvotes\u201d appeared as much as six time as often in headlines and articles than the word \u201cvoters.\u201d\n\nThat subtle word choice may seem modest. But the term \u201cvotes\u201d signaled what was being pursued by campaigns, what was contributing directly to electoral outcomes and what was providing citizen input in election narratives.\n\nWhen the term \u201cvotes\u201d was prevalent, as in news stories between 1948 and 1968, readers were urged to participate, reminded of their opportunity to influence the political system, and told how they can use the franchise to protect themselves and their interests. In other words, news stories suggested people decide \u2014 and benefit from \u2014 elections.\n\nThe shift from \u2018votes\u2019 to \u2018voters\u2019\n\nBut beginning in the late 1960s and early 1970s, news coverage featured less use of \u201cvote\u201d and more use of \u201cvoter.\u201d The word \u201cvoters\u201d first eclipsed the term \u201cvotes\u201d in 1972. The problem isn\u2019t necessarily with the word \u201cvoter\u201d itself. Other research, indeed, has found it to be a powerful term in mobilization efforts. The issue here is with how journalists use it.\n\nAt that time, reporters began exposing how campaign operatives were using survey data to anticipate voter preferences. News organizations also embraced polls as a way to offer timely, reliable and sophisticated election story lines. Concurrently, news coverage focused less on the relationship between candidates, voters and policy positions and more on political operatives in American life.\n\nWhile \u201cvotes\u201d connoted public involvement, feedback and participation, \u201cvoters\u201d was a means to write stories about the electoral horse race and strategists spinning for their interests. \u201cVoters\u201d were also frequently portrayed as frustrated by the role of money in politics, apathetic in response to bad candidates, endangered by voter purges or intimidated by voter identification laws. This portrayal was far less empowering of voters\u2019 role in the political process.\n\nWhat could change this?\n\nHow could news coverage talk about electoral participation in ways that won\u2019t decrease interest in it or incite frustration with the media?\n\nTo begin to answer this question, we conducted an experiment within a Polimetrix (now YouGov) online survey in 2008. All respondents read a story about the 2008 presidential primary, but the story varied in key ways.\n\nOne group of respondents read a generic story about the 2008 primaries. A second group read that story, but it also included a paragraph that portrayed voters as active participants by describing how \u201cvotes\u201d were being solicited and \u201cvoters\u201d were being urged to act. A third group read a story that portrayed voters more like spectators (\u201cvoters must face a fierce horse race\u201d) and included polling results.\n\nPeople who read the \u201cactive participants\u201d story \u2014 including both Democrats and Republicans \u2014 were more likely to express a desire to vote and less likely to express frustration with the press, compared with those who read the \u201cspectators\u201d story.\n\nThe difference between the words \u201cvotes\u201d and \u201cvoters\u201d may seem trivial. But in campaign reporting, these two words may send different messages about who decides elections. When voters are implicitly given a more robust role to play in elections, democracy \u2014 and the news outlets that write about it \u2014 may benefit.\n\nSharon Jarvis (@DrSharonspeaks) is an associate professor of communication studies and associate director at the Annette Strauss Institute for Civic Life at the University of Texas at Austin.", "\n\nA protester stands on the lap of \u201cLady Justice\u201d on the steps of the Supreme Court in Washington on Oct. 6.

But Jared\u2019s parents (Nicole Kidman and Russell Crowe) would prefer that their son fake it for the rest of his life \u2014 or at least the rest of theirs.\n\nMost of the events in this fact-based, Arkansas-set drama take place within the confines of a sexuality-reform school of sorts with a sinisterly euphemistic name: Love in Action. Yet the crux of the story is the possibility of Jared\u2019s reconciliation with his mom and dad. Predictably, it is Jared\u2019s mother who is more likely to put her love into action.\n\n[Here are the 12 movies you should see this holiday season]\n\nWriter-director Joel Edgerton plays Victor Sykes, a self-styled therapist who runs the conversion center with the help of a thuggish enforcer (Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea). Among the other young men whose identities are supposed to be erased are characters played by Australian singer Troye Sivan and Canadian filmmaker Xavier Dolan.\n\nA literature student, Jared ends up in the program after a sexual encounter with a fellow college student who wrongs him in multiple ways \u2014 including by outing Jared to his parents. Jared\u2019s father, a buttoned-up-tight preacher and car dealer, turns to his church\u2019s fellow Baptist leaders for guidance. They suggest that the reader of Oscar Wilde and Vladimir Nabokov be reprogrammed at the center, where the Bible is the only good book.\n\n\n\nNicole Kidman, who delivers a memorable speech, and Russell Crowe, as the parents. (Focus Features)\n\nAlthough the names have been changed in this scenario, the film is derived from a 2016 memoir by Garrard Conley, who began his writing career by exposing the attempted conversion he\u2019d experienced. Filmed here in chilly shades of blue, the center is a grim reeducation camp where failure is certain. But there are various ways to flunk, some more devastating than others.\n\n\u201cBoy Erased\u201d is a showcase for the 21-year-old Hedges, who played a closeted boy in \u201cLady Bird\u201d and who plays a teen with a different sort of burden in the upcoming drama \u201cBen Is Back.\u201d In each of those roles, the boy-next-door actor finds just the right combination of ordinary and anomalous.\n\nHedges is briefly upstaged by Kidman, whose character finally switches from dutiful wife to protective mother to deliver a speech that\u2019s humane and stirring. Her remarks are also altogether expected, which is true of nearly everything else in this movie. It\u2019s well-meaning and finely crafted, yet short on surprises, either narrative or emotional. Like the conversion program it depicts, \u201cBoy Erased\u201d is unlikely to change any minds.\n\nThe final credits are accompanied by a trite Sivan-sung anthem, but the tune is worth enduring to read the brief notes about the subsequent lives of the men who inspired two of the movie\u2019s central characters. Both ultimately decided that love, not religious dogma or family expectations, should guide their actions.", "The United States has held 56 presidential elections, going back to the first in 1789. And every time, we\u2019re told that the latest one is really, really important. \u00b6 Just listen to this year\u2019s Republican contenders. \u201cI believe this is the most important election in your lifetime, no matter how old you are,\u201dRick Santorum told a crowd in Tulsa this past week. Former House speaker Newt Gingrich goes further, deeming this race the most crucial \u201csince 1860.\u201d \u00b6 Democrats do it, too. \u201cThis is certainly the most important election in my lifetime \u2014 not just because I\u2019m running,\u201d candidate Barack Obama said in 2008. And in his 2004 Democratic convention speech, John Kerry cited war and a shrinking middle class to declare that year\u2019s contest \u201cthe most important election of our lifetime.\u201d\u00b6 All elections are important, no doubt, but some must be more important than others. How can we decide which are truly historic? I don\u2019t believe there is a single, decisive yardstick, so let me suggest an array of criteria for picking the most important elections in American history \u2014 and which contest rates as the most important of all.\n\nWas it considered especially\n\nimportant at the time?\n\nThis is the stuff of immediate context. Were voters energized? Did they expect a close vote? Were the stakes deemed especially high? And immediately afterward, did the national verdict seem particularly significant?\n\nOn this score, the 2012 contest seems to be ranking fairly high, though it may seem so precisely because we\u2019re in the middle of it. In fact, in long-term historical comparisons, this immediacy measure is tough to get a handle on. Citizens are always supposed to be interested in elections \u2014 that is democracy, after all \u2014 and hype about the stakes is, as we know, incessant.\n\nFrom the available historical accounts, it might be hard to beat 1860, when a nation facing the prospect of secession and civil war put Abraham Lincoln in the White House. There\u2019s also the close, high-turnout election of 1896, when a frenzied rally by the business community warded off the populist William Jennings Bryan. The Rutherford Hayes-Samuel Tilden election of 1876 brought a photo finish and a contested verdict. The explosive four-candidate election of 1912 (with Democrat Woodrow Wilson, Republican William Howard Taft, Progressive Party candidate Theodore Roosevelt and Socialist Eugene Debs) brought talk of an Armageddon-style political showdown by the exuberant Progressives. It is also hard to rule out 1932, when FDR bested Herbert Hoover during the Great Depression, even if that contest wasn\u2019t close and turnout was modest.\n\nAfter World War II, the measurement and analysis get better. Political scientists Steven Rosenstone and John Mark Hansen used public opinion surveys to examine the period from 1952 to 1988; they reported that the indicator of voters saying they \u201ccare a good deal which party wins\u201d peaked with the Dwight Eisenhower-Adlai Stevenson election of 1952, during the seemingly endless Korean War. More recently, the 2004 election brought high interest, probably because of the Sept. 11 attacks and the war in Iraq, while the 2008 vote saw enormous excitement and anticipation surrounding the candidacies of Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton.\n\nWas the election associated with\n\nmajor, long-lasting policy shifts?\n\nHere we switch to the kind of hindsight that historians deal in: What follows from an election is what counts. Clear standouts in this regard are, once again, 1860, which was followed by the Civil War and the end of slavery, and 1932, which gave us the New Deal.\n\nBut others are worth special mention. The 1828 election ushered in the Jacksonian era, which saw the abolishment of the National Bank as well as the appalling removal of Indian tribes from their lands east of the Mississippi. The 1876 election brought the end of Southern Reconstruction. The 1912 vote gave us Wilson and his New Freedom policies, including the income tax and the creation of the Federal Reserve. And in the past half-century, the 1964 contest between Lyndon Johnson and Barry Goldwater brought the Great Society and the advancement of civil rights, while 1980 launched the Reagan revolution.\n\nWas the election associated with major, long-lasting change in voter coalitions?\n\nThis is of special concern to political scientists, who look for long-term patterns in voting behavior, with \u201clong-term\u201d meaning at least one generation. Once again, 1860 and 1932 rate high: The FDR-Hoover contest boosted the Democrats for a long time, much as Lincoln\u2019s election led to durable power for the Republicans.\n\nOtherwise, Thomas Jefferson\u2019s victory over John Adams in 1800 effectively ended Federalist domination, while the 1816 election saw the demise of the Federalists, period, once they had tilted to the wrong side in the War of 1812. The 1828 election brought the Jacksonian coalition of small farmers and the working class. The Democrats surged in 1876, as did the Republicans in the McKinley-Bryan election of 1896, partly thanks to the economic depressions that preceded both votes. The Republicans skyrocketed in the Warren Harding-James Cox election of 1920 because of the casualties, economic slump, strikes and general disorder brought by World War I and its aftermath. Some analysts point to a lasting Republican surge in 1952, owing possibly to the Korean War and to the simple fact that the Democrats had been in power too long.\n\nSince 1952, no election seems to truly qualify on this score. Even though the 1980 vote gave us Reagan, by then the Republicans had been winning most presidential elections for quite a while; yet they couldn\u2019t win the House until 1994. The GOP\u2019s rise was episodic and gradual.\n\nWhat if the other guy had won?\n\nIn a close election, would a win for the losing side have made a big difference, taking the country in a significantly different direction? It is fun to look back and play the counterfactual game.\n\nElections can be a lottery. A gaffe, a rainstorm in the wrong place or hanging chads can tip the outcome \u2014 and major policy differences can result. In the liberal or progressive canon, a famous lost chance was the fairly close election of 1896. Who knows what a Bryan presidency would have amounted to \u2014 new taxes, trust-busting, regulations or currency reform? Historian Gary Kornblith has written about the knife\u2019s-edge election of 1844: Suppose that the winner that year, James K. Polk, eager for U.S. military expansion, had lost to Henry Clay, who was not? Could the seizure of half of Mexico, the expansion of slavery to the Southwestand the resulting tensions that fueled the Civil War all have been avoided?\n\nIn 1864, Union military victories in September seemed to lift the incumbent Lincoln over a Democratic Party that appeared ready to settle for peace with the Confederacy and the preservation of slavery.\n\nAnd how about the photo-finish George W. Bush-Al Gore election of 2000? A President Gore would probably have reacted differently to the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001 \u2014 but how differently is far from clear. The two campaigns don\u2019t offer obvious clues, and there is an awful lot of contingency in foreign policy, where presidents must react to challenges as they crop up. We can have hunches but not answers.\n\nDid the campaign itself have a big\n\nimpact, independent of the result?\n\nElections are not just the counting of November ballots. During the months of a presidential campaign, voter opinion can be shaped as well as expressed \u2014 the whole long process can even push the nation toward a new consensus. In 1940, the Republican nomination of the internationalist Wendell Willkie left his party\u2019s isolationist wing in the dust. The resulting Willkie-FDR campaign, relatively free of isolationism, probably helped foster national agreement on foreign policy in that scary year when the Nazis were marching and bombing in Europe. In 1948, the Republican nomination of the moderate Thomas Dewey, President Harry Truman\u2019s platform and the marginalization of extremist third parties as the season went on seem to have nudged the country toward agreement on civil rights, the New Deal\u2019s welfare-state programs and the prosecution of the Cold War against the Soviet Union.\n\nOn the other hand, election seasons can push toward dissent, too. In 1860, the Democratic Party broke in half, reflecting and exacerbating the regional tensions that brought civil war. And for those of us who were there, who can forget the election season of 1968? The anti-Vietnam War movement sprang to life, President Johnson bowed out, the Democratic Party self-destructed at its nominating convention in Chicago, and the populist segregationist George Wallace drew an eighth of the vote in November. That year, the election process itself seems to have contributed to national disintegration.\n\nDid it set a landmark political\n\nprecedent?\n\nIn 1789, when George Washington was ushered into the presidency, it was a big deal that a nationwide choice of a chief executive could happen at all. Jefferson\u2019s election in 1800 set a precedent as one national ruling party peacefully displaced another. Andrew Jackson\u2019s election in 1828 brought mass political participation, at least among white males. Ulysses Grant\u2019s reelection in 1872 profited from the 15th Amendment\u2019s enfranchisement of African Americans. The Harding-Cox election of 1920 saw a doubling of eligible voters after the 19th Amendment enfranchised women. The 1960 election sent the first Roman Catholic president, Kennedy, to the White House. And of course 2008 scored two major firsts in the realms of gender and race: Clinton came close to the presidency, and Obama reached it.\n\nWhere does this leave us? What was the most important election in our nation\u2019s history? All in all, blending these various standards, I would rank 1860 as No. 1: That year\u2019s campaign contributed to a disintegration of the national fabric, and the aftermath included the astonishingly bloody Civil War, the abolition of slavery and the construction of a much stronger national state. I would rank 1932 at No. 2: No election of the past century has matched it for policy innovation \u2014 the New Deal \u2014 or for the lasting coalitional surge it brought to the winning party.\n\nAfter those two, many of the contests I\u2019ve listed would fight it out for the runner-up slots, with no clear ranking in sight.\n\nIt is interesting to note that the list grows lean in recent decades. The post-World War II elections of 1948, 1952, 1960, 1964, 1968 and 1980 merit mention \u2014 but the ones after that, very little. Am I being shortsighted? Possibly, but notwithstanding what we might think about it, American political life has become smoother and more stable. In our history, standout elections have tended to hinge on explosive circumstances or events \u2014 slavery and race, large wars, or uncontrollable economic disasters. (After all, there were no TARP bailouts in the depressions of 1873, 1893 or 1929.)\n\nWithout a slavery crisis, the 1860 election ceases to be consequential. No World War I means no era of Harding, Coolidge and Hoover. Without a Great Depression, there is no New Deal. No Vietnam War, no monumental 1968 campaign. In the battle for our votes, there is a lot of ghastliness back there.\n\nThese days, U.S. society is more inclusive and more prosperous. Government management of the economy is better. There is a safety net. Since the 1970s, our military enterprises have been smaller; even in the case of Iraq and Afghanistan, U.S. casualties and the share of gross domestic product going to the military were considerably lessthan in earlier wars, and there was no draft. It has been harder to rock elections out of their usual orbit, at least very far or for very long. Party clashes over taxes and spending are in lively form \u2014 but that is normal politics.\n\nYes, voter interest soared in 2004 and 2008, but I do not see any sign that the elections of Bush and Obama brought major, lasting changes in voter coalitions. As for significant long-term policy change, the jury is out. Possibly some of the Obama program of 2009-10 will stick and be considered historically important (health care comes to mind), but we simply don\u2019t know yet. The signal significance of 2008 was the election of an African American to the White House \u2014 a truly historic event.\n\nAs for 2012? There may be some lasting, important policy changes to emerge from this election, but most of the time that doesn\u2019t happen. So far in this campaign, we don\u2019t seem to have witnessed big, energizing events, a new mood that invests the public in the outcome or signs of a clear voter mandate. In most elections, deft management of the economy and smart, prudent foreign policy are enough to ask for.\n\noutlook@washpost.com\n\nDavid R.

The boys also said they were taken by the armed men late Sunday and didn\u2019t know where they were being held.\n\nThe men in the video said they would only release the students once the goal of creating a new state is achieved.\n\n\u201cWe shall only release you after the struggle. You will be going to school now here,\u201d the men said. The video could not be independently verified, but parents said on social media they recognized their children in the recording.\n\nFighting between the military and separatists increased after the government clamped down on peaceful demonstrations by English-speaking teachers and lawyers protesting what they said were their marginalization by Cameroon\u2019s French-speaking majority.\n\nHundreds have been killed in the past year.\n\nThe separatists have vowed to destabilize the regions as part of the strategy for creating a breakaway state. They have attacked civilians who do not support their cause, including teachers who were killed for disobeying orders to keep schools closed.\n\nThere have been kidnappings at other schools, but the group taken Sunday was the largest number abducted at one time in Cameroon\u2019s Anglophone regions. The separatists also have set fire to at least 100 schools and driven out students and teachers from buildings taken over as training grounds.\n\n\u201cThese appalling abductions show just how the general population is paying the highest price as violence escalates in the Anglophone region,\u201d said Samira Daoud, Amnesty International deputy regional director for West and Central Africa. \u201cThe abduction of schoolchildren and teachers can never be justified.\u201d\n\nAmnesty International expressed solidarity with the students\u2019 families and demanded \u201cthat the Cameroon authorities do everything in their power to ensure all the pupils and school staff are freed unharmed.\u201d\n\nLast week, separatist militants attacked workers on a state-run rubber plantation in southwestern Cameroon, allegedly chopping off their fingers because the men defied an order to stay away from the farms.\n\nAn American missionary also died in the North West region near its capital, Bamenda, when he was shot in the head amid fighting between separatists and soldiers.\n\nThe turmoil in Cameroon comes after President Paul Biya won a seventh term last month in an election the U.S. said was marked by irregularities. Biya, who has been in office since 1982, is set to be inaugurated Tuesday.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Carley Petesch in Dakar, Senegal, contributed.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(John Raoux/AP)\n\nMany media outlets have been reporting about how this year\u2019s U.S. midterm election includes women and people of color running for office in record numbers. According to Politico, 180 women and 133 people of color have been nominated to the Democratic House ticket during this election cycle. Others have looked at unusual efforts to get young people to the polls.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know much about how race and gender among young adults jointly work to influence people\u2019s attitudes. Data from the GenForward Survey offer some understanding of how race and gender shape the political preferences of younger voters.\n\nHere\u2019s how we did our research\n\nOur data, based on 1,881 responses and collected from Sept. 21 to Oct. 6, come from the most recent GenForward Survey. The GenForward Survey is a bimonthly, nationally representative survey of young adults between the ages of 18 and 34 that focuses on how race and ethnicity shape political attitudes. GenForward Surveys are designed to compare racial group attitudes with a higher degree of confidence than most other surveys and are weighted to recent population estimates. These qualities allow us to take an intersectional look at how millennials view the midterm election. Although these data are from earlier in the campaign cycle, the patterns we observe are likely to remain stable, especially the gaps by race and gender. To identify likely voters, we use a procedure based on the Perry-Gallup Index that creates an additive scale using individual survey responses and past election turnout rates.\n\nHere\u2019s what we found:\n\n1. Millennials\u2019 party and candidate preferences\n\nIn general, millennials who say they\u2019ll vote overwhelmingly support their district\u2019s Democratic congressional candidate \u2014 by a nearly 30-point margin.\n\nAmong likely voters of color, 86 percent favor the Democratic candidate, while only 50 percent of white likely voters do. Only 10 percent of likely voters of color favor the Republican candidate, compared with 44 percent of white likely voters.\n\n[Could anything \u2014 even Taylor Swift \u2014 boost the youth vote in 2018?]\n\nShifting from race to gender, we find that the gender gap among likely voters is more than 20 points. Fully 76 percent of women who are likely voters support the Democratic congressional candidate in their district, while only 55 percent of male-identified likely voters do. Only 19 percent of women who are likely to vote support the Republican candidate, compared with 40 percent of men.\n\nBut if we look more closely, we find that only white millennial likely voters actually have a gender gap. The gender gap among likely voters of color is within the margin of error, with only 5 percent more men than women saying they\u2019ll vote for a Democrat for Congress. Meanwhile, about 69 percent of millennial white women likely to vote support the Democratic candidate, almost 30 points more than the 40 percent of white millennial men who do. A majority of white millennial men support their Republican candidate, compared with only about a quarter of white millennial women.\n\nPolitical analysts have remarked that this year\u2019s unprecedented candidate diversity could be the key to getting millennials to the polls. We find some evidence to support this claim, although there are important differences by race and gender. About 40 percent of women of color and 46 percent of white women say they would be more likely to support a candidate who is a woman; that\u2019s true for only 30 percent of men of color and 23 percent of white men.\n\nWe find a similar pattern for candidates of color. About 38 percent of millennial women of color, 37 percent of men of color and 30 percent of white women would be more likely to support a candidate who is a person of color; the same is true for only 15 percent of white millennial men.\n\nThese divergent preferences could stem at least in part from differences in desired candidate qualities. Likely millennial voters of color and white women say the candidate quality most important to them is someone who can \u201cbring about needed change.\u201d For millennial white men, the most important quality is a candidate who \u201cshares my values.\u201d\n\nAlthough the preferences of millennials often differ when disaggregating by race and/or gender, there is one area where they agree. Across race and gender, millennials say they are disillusioned with Congress. Majorities of millennials do not think Congress represents the interests of people like them.\n\n[In the 2018 midterms, many more people are running \u2014 and far more seats are contested \u2014 than we\u2019ve seen for a generation]\n\n2. Issues that are most important to voters of color/different genders\n\nAmong likely millennial voters overall, women are most likely to cite health care, immigration, and the environment and climate change as most important in deciding their vote, while men cite taxes, immigration and economic growth. If we break that down by race and gender, we find few differences among Latino and Asian American likely voters; both men and women cite immigration as the most important issue deciding their vote. African American likely voters cite racism as most important. Among likely white millennial voters, however, women are most likely to cite environment/climate change and health care, while men cite taxes as most important in deciding their vote.\n\n3. Attitudes about Donald Trump\n\nMillennials who are likely to vote in the midterm election, especially women and people of color, are fed up with President Trump. Most support his immediate impeachment. About 73 percent of millennial men of color, 77 percent of women of color and 68 percent of white women strongly disapprove of Trump, while only 38 percent of millennial white men do.\n\nWhen asked about impeachment, answers similarly break down by race and gender. Although 72 percent of millennial men of color, 70 percent of women of color and 58 percent of white women strongly favor impeaching Trump, only 26 percent of millennial white men say the same. In the aggregate, millennials also generally think Congress should start impeachment proceedings now. But again, white men are the outliers. Nearly 85 percent of women of color, 76 percent of men of color and 69 percent of white women say Congress should begin impeachment; only 28 percent of white millennial men agree.\n\n[The Kavanaugh confirmation polarized women, and motivated them to vote \u2014 some for Republicans, some for Democrats]\n\nWhich millennials?\n\nMillennials are the largest potential voting bloc and the most diverse generation in the United States. According to census data, about 29 percent of millennials are white men, 28 percent are white women, 7 percent are African American men, 7 percent are African American women, 3 percent are Asian American men, 3 percent are Asian American women, 11 percent are Latino, and 10 percent are Latina. This diversity shows in their political attitudes \u2014 which could have important implications for the midterm election. Some suggest they may turn out to vote in numbers never before seen from those younger than 35. If so, their interest in racial and gender diversity may lead to future Democratic majorities.\n\nMatthew Fowler and Vladimir E.

(Andrew Harnik/AP)\n\nMedia columnist\n\nOn election night 2016, I described the news media\u2019s campaign performance as \u201can epic fail.\u201d\n\nYou might remember what happened: the sense of inevitability about Hillary Clinton\u2019s rise, the damaging false equivalency that resulted, the free advertising provided in live coverage of Donald Trump\u2019s rallies and speeches, the crazily swinging \u201cneedle\u201d on the New York Times website.\n\nAnd so much more that we\u2019d like to forget, but really shouldn\u2019t.\n\nSo now, with the midterm elections upon us, it\u2019s fair to ask how much improvement has there been.\n\nThe short answer: not enough.\n\nGranted, mainstream journalists aren\u2019t making all of the same mistakes they made two years ago.\n\nWe\u2019re more careful about tossing around predictions based on our none-too-savvy interpretations of public opinion polls. We better understand (and better convey, as my colleague Philip Bump cleverly did in a graphic) the concept of probability.\n\nWe\u2019ve made fact-checking President Trump into a necessary cottage industry. And we\u2019ve gotten over our hesitance to use the L-word \u2014 lie \u2014 about his escalating falsehoods. Or even, when warranted, the R-word \u2014 racist \u2014 as CNN did in its initial news coverage of a recent and now-infamous Trump ad that falsely accuses Democrats of helping Central American criminals invade America.\n\nBut there\u2019s still one overarching problem: Too many journalists allow Trump to lead them around by the nose, which is why you\u2019ve heard so very much about that migrant caravan in recent weeks.\n\nWith the president as their de facto assignment editor, too many seem to respond \u201chow high?\u201d when Trump says jump.\n\nWide-eyed coverage of his politically driven pet issues \u2014 primarily the supposed horrors of immigration \u2014 has dominated the past few weeks of news, with a fixation on the refugees coming north through Mexico.\n\nSkepticism and context make an appearance in media reports, but it\u2019s often too little and too late. And, even when smart and nuanced, the sheer volume of immigration coverage plays into Trump\u2019s hands.\n\nJournalists too often parrot what the president says and giddily follow his shiny-object distractions du jour.\n\nHere\u2019s some of what\u2019s been happening on network and cable TV, and in national news outlets.\n\nGullibility and scoop obsession\n\nWhen Trump sat down with reporter Jonathan Swan of the digital news site Axios last week, he cannily floated the idea of eliminating birthright citizenship by executive order \u2014 knowing it would make big news.\n\nSwan was \u201cexcited to share,\u201d he tweeted, his scoop, described as follows: \u201cExclusive: Trump to terminate birthright citizenship.\u201d Thus he (initially, at least) allowed the president to air this constitutionally dubious notion as if it were almost enshrined at the National Archives.\n\nThen, news organizations from the Associated Press to Bloomberg News went along for the ride, in news alerts and headlines and tweets that gave the false impression that this was something that could quite easily come to pass. (In fact, it might well require a constitutional amendment.)\n\nIn many cases, the stories took a more measured approach, but many news consumers don\u2019t get beyond a misleading headline.\n\nAs Mathew Ingram wrote in Columbia Journalism Review, getting scoops is great but not if, like this one, \u201cthey perpetuate a Trump lie.\u201d\n\nAnd as Trumpian falsehoods have wildly escalated in recent weeks, the media have not figured out how to deal with them, other than to point them out after the fact.\n\nLust for audiences\n\nTake a recent headline in the Hill: \u201cTrump: \u2018I wouldn\u2019t be surprised\u2019 if Soros were paying for migrant caravan.\u201d\n\nAs Daniel Dale, who does exemplary, tough-minded work as Washington correspondent for the Toronto Star, analyzed it, this is \u201chow the Trump-clickbait complex works.\u201d\n\nA reporter had asked Trump if he thought philanthropist George Soros might be financing the movement of migrants through Mexico, and though Trump hadn\u2019t even brought up Soros, he was happy to swing at the fat pitch. \u201cI don\u2019t know who, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised.\u201d A truncated quote in the headline and a thin-as-gruel story beneath it made the whole cycle irresponsible.\n\nIt happens all the time.\n\nSimilarly, the talking heads format on cable news, doomed to endlessly fill the 24/7 news hole, takes its lead from whatever silliness is happening in the moment, often dictated by Trump.\n\nCNN chief Jeff Zucker admitted recently that whenever his network pivots away from Trump \u2014 the self-described \u201cratings machine\u201d \u2014 viewership plummets.\n\nFox News' endless propaganda\n\nThe reality-based world went into a tizzy of appreciation last week when anchor Shep Smith took some on-air time to voice the obvious about the migrant caravan: \u201cThere is no invasion. No one\u2019s coming to get you.\u201d\n\nThe reassurance landed like an asteroid of truth on the vast planet of hyperbolic fearmongering that is Fox News. It was so weird in its context that it provoked a spate of news stories from other outlets.\n\nRefreshing as it might have been in the moment, Smith\u2019s Earth-is-round pronouncements \u2014 this wasn\u2019t the first \u2014 probably do more harm than good. They amount to a mirage: that Fox indeed is fair and balanced, when in fact it\u2019s descended even further into pro-Trump propaganda and, at times, conspiracy-peddling.\n\nFar more typical is Sean Hannity, frothing at the mouth about the caravan: \u201cA very serious, dangerous situation is about to boil over at our southern border.\u201d Or Tucker Carlson on how illegal immigration has made the United States \u201ca fallen country.\u201d\n\n'Enemy' status\n\nIt is appalling and damaging that the president describes the nation\u2019s journalists as the \u201cenemy of the people.\u201d But we do harm by overreacting to it and to the familiar charges of liberal bias.\n\nThis works beautifully for Trump, who gets to point to the collective media freakout as clear proof of their leaning left. (As Sarah Sanders scolded last month in a press briefing, 90 percent of the stories about Trump are negative, as if there should be some expectation that 50 percent of all stories should be positive, no matter what\u2019s going on.)\n\nThe energy spent fuming about Trump\u2019s anti-press jabs would be far better used on bringing a more skeptical, context-heavy approach to everyday coverage.\n\nMore insidiously, taking Trump\u2019s \u201cenemy\u201d bait has another, less obvious effect. As the media try desperately to seem evenhanded \u2014 unbiased, not left-leaning \u2014 they end up overcompensating. As Media Matters for America documented recently, conservative guests often dominate the Sunday TV news shows, across all networks.\n\nWith an enemy like this, Trump and his cohort don\u2019t need friends.\n\nBright spots\n\nMichael Barbaro of the New York Times set a good tone when he tweeted that his popular news-oriented podcast would take a pass on the president\u2019s impromptu pronouncements regarding immigration: \u201cCan\u2019t speak for rest of media, but the Daily is deliberately playing down these events because they are clearly not policy remarks or policy announcements. They are deliberate attempts to inflame the electorate before the midterms. Just happens to be from the White House.\u201d\n\nNicolle Wallace of MSNBC said she wouldn\u2019t air Trump\u2019s immigration remarks live, holding off until they could be fact-checked and summarized first.\n\nI also appreciated the BuzzFeed News headline on the birthright-citizenship story: \u201cNow Trump Is Saying He\u2019ll Stop Babies Born In The US From Becoming Citizens, Though He Probably Can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nWe need a lot more of this in every bit of the reporting, framing and promotion of national political news. We need a lot less \u201cexcited to share,\u201d a lot less wound-licking, a lot less \u201cHow high, Mr. President?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s probably unreasonable to assign a grade that considers national media organizations including ProPublica and Fox News.\n\nBut, having observed the coverage for months, while holding my temples in dismay, I\u2019ll take a stab at it anyway.\n\nMidterm grade: C-minus.\n\nThe best thing you can say about that? It\u2019s not an epic fail.\n\nFor more by Margaret Sullivan visit wapo.st/sullivan", "U.S.-bound Central American migrants begin their morning trek with a free ride in the back of a truck as they leave Cordoba, Veracruz state, Mexico, Monday, Nov. 5, 2018.

(Martin Meissner/AP)\n\nBERLIN \u2014 Just days ahead of Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections, the U.S. Labor Department released new wage growth figures last week showing the strongest annual year-on-year rise since 2009. Private workers now make $27.30 per hour on average.\n\nThe Trump administration has celebrated those figures as a watershed moment for the U.S. economy, which produced job gains in recent years but little improvement in wages. But the United States isn\u2019t the only country where workers are better off. In Europe, wages have been on the rise, too.\n\nMeasuring the extent to which wages have improved here since the financial crisis is a bit trickier, however. One reason for that is Europe\u2019s \u201c13th salary\u201d phenomenon. While most Americans receive 12 months of salary each year, many Europeans receive 13. Similar arrangements are in place in Latin America and parts of Asia.\n\nWith U.S. unemployment dropping and wages on the rise, a 13th salary in the United States might not appear as far-fetched anymore as it did in prior years. But would it make sense?\n\nOriginally conceived as a way to get people to spend more money on gifts ahead of Christmas, the practice now widely varies across Europe. In Germany, nine out of 10 employees benefit from a 13th salary each year under terms that are usually agreed between unions and employers, according to new figures released Monday. While contractors benefit least, employees in the gas or pharmaceutical industries often receive additional bonuses that are higher than their pay in a normal month.\n\nSome countries, including Austria, have lower tax rates for \u201c13th salary\u201d payments than for normal salaries. Elsewhere, there are deadlines for employers to transfer a specified rate or even rules for a 14th salary. But the vast majority of European countries have provided employers with a lot of leeway to determine how much and to whom they pay additional money, making total income less transparent.\n\nThe practice might appear strange to most Americans, but some European employees have also long been unaware that they would be entitled to extra money. Last year, the government of Cyprus launched a campaign to inform employees of their right to demand a 13th salary. Noncompliance is a punishable offense in Cyprus, with a maximum fine of $17,000 or six months in prison.\n\nWhile the idea of adding a 13th or 14th month\u2019s salary payment might sound intriguing to many American employees, some critics insist that the United States is better off without it. The extra payments are usually not included in average salary figures, and they can unpredictably vary from year to year, even if wages themselves may stall or grow more rapidly.\n\nGiven its strong association with Christmas celebrations, the practice has also become politicized in some countries such as Austria, where far-right groups suggested in 2016 that Muslims should be excluded.\n\nMore recently, far-right groups also circulated unsubstantiated rumors that refugees were paid almost $1,000 each ahead of Christmas celebrations \u2014 adding a political spin to what was long a popular measure to boost wages and domestic spending.\n\nMore on WorldViews:\n\nTrump finds a \u2018like-minded\u2019 demagogue in Bolsonaro\n\nWhat are the midterm elections?\n\nA Japanese island quietly disappeared \u2014 and no one noticed until now", "The Trump administration is bracing for a massive staff shake-up in the weeks following the midterm elections, as the fates of a number of Cabinet secretaries and top White House aides are increasingly uncertain heading into a potentially perilous time for President Trump.\n\nSome embattled officials, including Attorney General Jeff Sessions, are expected to be fired or actively pushed out by Trump after months of bitter recriminations. Others, notably Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, may leave amid a mutual recognition that their relationship with the president has become too strained. And more still plan to take top roles on Trump\u2019s 2020 reelection campaign or seek lucrative jobs in the private sector after nearly two years in government.\n\nThe expected midterm exodus would bring fresh uncertainty and churn to a White House already plagued by high turnover and internal chaos. Many in Trump\u2019s orbit worry that the administration will face challenges filling the vacancies \u2014 especially if Democrats win the House majority and use their oversight powers to investigate the administration and issue subpoenas to top officials.\n\nTrump\u2019s allies, however, note that some turnover at the two-year mark is normal in any administration. They also say that any departures would give the president a chance to reshape the White House more fully in his own image.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he likes people leaving him,\u201d said Marc Short, a former White House director of legislative affairs. But \u201cit does provide the president with an opportunity to reset,\u201d he added. \u201cWhen he came in during the transition, Washington was new to him. I think he has a better idea of the talent he wants around him.\u201d\n\nShort added that, more than previous Oval Office occupants, Trump \u201cdoes function as his own chief of staff in a lot ways\u201d and might welcome the chance to bring in a new crop of aides more aligned with his vision. \u201cHe may not even know what all those people do,\u201d Short said, referring to some members of the current staff.\n\nThis portrait of the White House preparing for post-midterm staff changes comes from interviews with 14 senior White House officials, administration aides and Republican operatives, many of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to candidly discuss internal deliberations.\n\nAmong those most vulnerable to being dismissed are Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein, who is overseeing special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s Russia investigation after Sessions recused himself. Trump has routinely berated Sessions, whom he faults for the Russia investigation, but he and Rosenstein have forged an improved rapport in recent months.\n\nAllies of Sessions and some in the Justice Department believe the attorney general could be fired in humiliating fashion in the days immediately following Tuesday\u2019s elections. The White House has begun considering replacements, while Trump aides and confidants have cautioned the president he would face a backlash if he fired either of the top two Justice officials, particularly before the midterms.\n\nOther Cabinet officials \u2014 including Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and Nielsen \u2014 also face uncertain futures.\n\nMattis and Trump have long had \u201can uncomfortable working relationship,\u201d in the words of one former White House official. The two have clashed on a range of issues, including transgender people serving in the military, the Iran nuclear deal, military exercises with South Korea and conflicts in Afghanistan and Syria. Mattis has made securing military alliances a priority, and he has often found himself assuaging European and Asian allies rattled by Trump\u2019s comments.\n\nBut Trump is unlikely to fire Mattis, and Mattis \u2014 who has backed Trump on his controversial deployment of troops to the U.S. border \u2014 is unlikely to resign, according to people familiar with the dynamic.\n\nTrump has been skeptical of Nielsen because of her service in the George W. Bush administration, and the two have feuded over an influx of migrants on the southern border, which the president does not believe Nielsen is addressing forcefully enough. As with Sessions, the White House also has been discussing possible replacements for her.\n\nNielsen\u2019s primary protector has been White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly, another potential departure who has at times clashed with the president but has been asked by Trump to stay through 2020. If Kelly does leave, however, many say Nielsen is likely to follow.\n\nOn Zinke, the president started complaining in recent days to aides about news reports that the Justice Department is scrutinizing the interior secretary\u2019s real estate dealings in Montana. Trump has apparently asked how problematic Zinke\u2019s conduct has become.\n\nOther top figures, including Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and press secretary Sarah Sanders, also have been mentioned as possible departures in the coming months, though if they leave, they seem likely to do so of their own accord.\n\nSanders has a strong relationship with Trump and is expected to leave only if the right opportunity arises. In recent weeks, she has held increasingly infrequent briefings with the media, all but eliminating one of her most fraught responsibilities.\n\nOther West Wing aides intend to transition to Trump\u2019s reelection effort. Justin Clark, who heads the Office of Public Liaison, is expected to leave in the coming months to work on the campaign in a senior adviser role.\n\nNick Ayers, chief of staff to Vice President Pence, is also mentioned as a possible departure. He has a young family and has told those close to him that he is eager to return to his home state of Georgia. If he leaves, he may work on the reelection campaign, but he could stay in the West Wing, especially for a new job with more responsibility.\n\nDeputy Chief of Staff Johnny DeStefano, newly married and starting a family, is similarly expected to exit soon.\n\nTrump\u2019s White House has weathered an extraordinary amount of turnover. In its first year, the Trump administration far outpaced its modern predecessors for turnover with a rate of 34 percent, and its current overall rate is 58 percent, said Kathryn Dunn Tenpas, a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who has been studying White House personnel patterns for more than two decades.\n\nSome turnover around the two-year mark is natural, Dunn Tenpas said, but \u201cthe number of people resigning under pressure far exceeds that of any other administration.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe turnover,\u201d she added, \u201cmakes it that much more difficult to implement your agenda, when you\u2019re constantly hiring and rehiring and having to train and retrain people.\u201d\n\nIn 2006, then-President George W. Bush fired Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld after Democrats seized control of both chambers of Congress, in part because of deepening public opposition to the Iraq War.\n\nAfter the 2010 elections, which then-President Barack Obama called a \u201cshellacking\u201d because Republicans took over control of the House, several top White House staffers left their posts. Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel resigned to pursue a run for mayor in his hometown of Chicago, Deputy Chief of Staff Jim Messina left to manage Obama\u2019s reelection campaign, and press secretary Robert Gibbs departed a few months later.\n\nA poor performance by Republicans at the polls Tuesday could also complicate the calculation inside Trump\u2019s White House. David Bossie and Corey Lewandowski, former campaign officials who informally advise the president from outside the administration, are publishing a book the last week in November titled \u201cTrump\u2019s Enemies: How the Deep State Is Undermining the Presidency.\u201d\n\nThe book has caused consternation in Trump\u2019s circle among those who believe the duo might name aides and appointees who they think are not serving the president well.\n\n\u201cIt is fair to say that we outline in the book the challenges that he faces, both external to his administration and internal to his administration,\u201d Lewandowski said.\n\nA poor Election Day showing also would magnify the administration\u2019s existing challenge of recruiting and retaining top talent, especially in senior positions. The task is so difficult that Trump\u2019s aides are waiting until after the elections in the hopes of poaching Republican operatives who find themselves suddenly jobless, either because they worked on failed campaigns or lost their jobs in congressional leadership offices if Democrats take over.\n\nTrump has cast himself as a magnet for talent. \u201cBelieve me, everybody wants to work in the White House,\u201d he said in March.\n\nBut Chris Whipple, author of \u201cThe Gatekeepers,\u201d a history of White House chiefs of staff, said the absence in Trump\u2019s orbit of experienced staffers who command respect is striking.\n\nReferring to two White House chiefs of staff from the George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton administrations, Whipple said: \u201cThe bad news for Trump is that there are not a lot of Jim Bakers or Leon Panettas around, much less anybody of that ability who would be willing to work with him.\u201d", "\n\nA fossil mosasaur skull and partial skeleton excavated from Angola\u2019s costal cliffs for display in \u201cSea Monsters Unearthed,\u201d which debuts at the National Museum of Natural History on Friday.

Kavanaugh. The protesters are urging people to vote out those who support Kavanaugh. (AP)\n\nHere\u2019s a remarkable thing about the 2018 election campaign: how little has changed. That is the lesson from the third George Washington University Politics Poll, which was just released today. I think most people know that we live in a world of strong partisanship, which is increasingly evident in congressional voting. But how much partisanship helped stabilize people\u2019s preferences in this election season still surprised me.\n\nThe GW Politics poll is unusual because it has interviewed the exact same group of registered voters three different times in 2018: May, July and now Oct. 17-25. All told, 2,321 respondents took all three polls, which is 73 percent of the original 3,150 respondents first interviewed in May.\n\nTake the \u201cgeneric ballot\u201d question, which asks respondents to choose between the Democratic and Republican candidates in their district. In May, the split among these respondents was 46 percent for the Democrat and 37 percent for the Republican. About 13 percent were undecided.\n\nFive months later, the split was virtually identical: 48 percent to 40 percent. The percent who were undecided was lower (7 percent) but any shifts from undecided to \u201cdecided\u201d didn\u2019t really advantage either party.\n\nAnother way of looking at this: 96 percent of those who chose the Republican candidate in May also chose the Republican candidate in October. And 97 percent of those who chose the Democrat in May did so in November.\n\nAltogether, 80 percent of this sample was composed of partisans whose loyalty did not change. This wasn\u2019t much lower than the 90 percent who consistently approved or disapproved of President Trump across this time period. Consistent partisanship is simply the norm.\n\nIn addition to their lead in the generic ballot, Democrats have also led on several other dimensions and did so again in this October poll:\n\nBut, again, since July these numbers have only changed by a few percentage points at most. (See the July numbers here.) For example, in the October poll the Democratic candidate\u2019s advantage in job approval (54 percent vs. 46 percent approval for the Republican) was only slightly better than in July (52 percent vs. 48 percent).\n\nThe same stability was evident across a range of political issues, including the economy, health care, taxes and immigration. Despite months of efforts by both parties to shift opinions on these issues, they have remained relatively constant.\n\nPerhaps most notably for the GOP, consistent reports of economic growth have not improved the public\u2019s perceptions of the economy. In October, 39 percent said that the economy was getting better (versus getting worse or remaining the same). In May, it was 37 percent.\n\nA final thing that we have been tracking: voters\u2019 involvement and participation. In addition to asking whether they intended to vote, we have asked whether they had taken other kinds of action in the past three months \u2014 like signing a petition or talking to someone about how they should vote. We also asked whether they had been contacted by a political party.\n\nOverall, there was little sign of increased participation, with the exception of a small increase in the percentage who had talked to someone about how to vote. As in previous GW Politics Polls, Democrats and Republicans were equally likely to say they intended to vote, but Democrats had an advantage in several other areas:\n\nOf course, there are caveats. Perhaps the people who remained in our survey over these past five months tend to have strong opinions that change less frequently. Moreover, this national sample cannot capture any changes in individual districts. Nor does it capture opinions about the Senate races, where the forecast really has shifted.\n\nBut the results of this poll are in line with what other polls and forecasts are showing about the battle for the House: Overall, things just haven\u2019t changed that much:\n\nYou'd really have to stretch to claim there's much momentum either way in the House. Our forecast shows an uncertain but pretty flat race, with D's remaining favored. https://t.co/nMWlUPlerX pic.twitter.com/PmUr8Lun0G \u2014 Nate Silver (@NateSilver538) November 4, 2018\n\nThe only remaining question is how much Democrats can turn favorable national conditions, polls and strong fundraising into a House majority and, if so, how big a majority.", "\n\nA \u201cVote Here\u201d sign marks the entrance on Sept. 20 to an early voting station in downtown Minneapolis for Friday\u2019s opening of early voting in Minnesota.

And even as the sons requested the speedy retrieval of his remains, new details from Turkey\u2019s investigation into the case that were released Monday made that likelihood seem remote. A Turkish official said investigators believe Saudi Arabia sent a two-person \u201ccleanup\u201d team to Turkey nine days after Khashoggi\u2019s death to remove any evidence of his killing from the consulate as well as the nearby residence of the Saudi consul general.\n\nThe regional rivalry between Turkey and Saudi Arabia has captured the spotlight in the weeks since the killing of Khashoggi, a contributing columnist to The Washington Post. The government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has tried to prod Saudi leaders to acknowledge what he says is their role in the death. The Saudi government refused to comment for weeks but, in the face of international outrage, finally conceded that Khashoggi was killed in their consulate, even as they blamed it on rogue Saudi agents.\n\nLost in the din have been the voices of Khashoggi\u2019s children, grieving and forced to pick through a confusion of graphic news reports as they piece together details of their father\u2019s death.

This will happen,\u201d he said.\n\n[Saudi campaign to abduct and silence rivals abroad goes back decades]\n\nErdogan has said that Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s killing by Saudi agents was premeditated and that the order came from the \u201chighest levels\u201d of the Saudi government, although he has not specified who he thinks was responsible.

Turkish authorities said the team dismembered Khashoggi\u2019s body and disposed of it.\n\nTurkey has repeatedly accused Saudi authorities of trying to obstruct its investigation. On Monday, a Turkish official said that at least two members of a team that Saudi Arabia sent to investigate Khashoggi\u2019s killing were actually there to cover it up.\n\nThe official, who was not authorized to comment on the record and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the dispatch of the two men to Turkey \u201csuggests that Khashoggi\u2019s slaying was within the knowledge of top Saudi officials.\u201d\n\nThe official confirmed details in a report published Monday in Turkey\u2019s pro-government Sabah newspaper that said the two men \u2014 a chemist and a toxicologist \u2014 were part of a delegation of Saudi investigators sent to Turkey nine days after Khashoggi was killed.\n\nBeginning Oct. 12, the two men visited the consulate regularly for a week, the paper reported.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the two individuals came to Turkey for the sole purpose of covering up evidence,\u201d the official said.\n\nZeynep Karatas contributed to this report.\n\nRead more\n\nProsecutor says Khashoggi was strangled and dismembered, but fate of body is a mystery\n\nCrown prince sought to lure Khashoggi back to Saudi Arabia and detain him\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "\n\nSupporters applaud President Trump as he arrives to attend a campaign rally at Middle Georgia Regional Airport in Macon, Ga., on Sunday. (Reuters) (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)\n\nAmong the broadest gulfs in The Post\u2019s new poll, conducted with our partners at ABC News, are views of this Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections by white men and women of varying educational backgrounds.\n\nAsked to pick between the Democratic and Republican candidates in their House district, white men without a college degree preferred the Republican by 39 points. White women with a college degree, on the other hand, preferred the Democrat by 16 points.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nThat\u2019s a wide gap, but also a by-now familiar one. White men without degrees have been identified as part of President Trump\u2019s core base of support since nearly his first day as a candidate. White women with degrees, meanwhile, have increasingly expressed opposition to the GOP, to the point that former Trump adviser Stephen K. Bannon on several occasions has simply written them off as potential Republican voters.\n\nBut the composition of that group isn\u2019t clear. Older Americans are less likely to have college degrees, given the surge in college enrollment in recent decades. Are these fervent Republicans \u2014 and likely Trump supporters \u2014 mostly older, perhaps higher income Americans? Are they disenfranchised younger men? We can ask similar questions about those college-educated women: Who are they?\n\nTo answer that question, we can look at data from the 2016 General Social Survey, a biannual survey conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago.\n\nOverall, the largest group of white men is in the 30-to-49 age group, a slightly lower percentage than the population on the whole (note the dashed horizontal lines indicating the overall population figures). Those without college degrees tend to be younger than the population on the whole; those with degrees tend to be significantly older.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nThis pattern generally holds with white women, too. The density of older white women is larger than the density of older people in the population broadly, a function in large part of higher life expectancies among women. Notice that white women with college degrees are less heavily skewed older than are white men with degrees. More than 3-in-10 white men with degrees (bachelors or graduate) are aged 65 or older; less than a quarter of white women with degrees are that old.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nFor the sake of comparison, contrast those figures with the numbers for nonwhite men. Nonwhite men skew much younger than white men or women overall.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nBroadly, white men without college degrees are distributed by age in about the same way as the population on the whole. But what about income?\n\nWhite men overall and white men without degrees tend to skew toward the higher end of the income range more than the general population. (Among those with degrees, the skewing is more dramatic, a reinforcement of the link between income and education.)\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nAgain, compare that to white women. The density of women in each income group drops steadily among those without a degree, staying more in line with the population on the whole. White women without degrees are less likely to be in the highest income bracket than the population as a whole; white men without a degree are slightly more likely to be in that bracket.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nThe gulf among nonwhite men is much broader. Nonwhite men with a degree are more likely than members of the general population to be in the highest income group but, unlike with whites, they are much less likely to be in the $50,000 to $100,000 income range.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nOverall, the distribution of white men without a degree tends to favor the second scenario we outlined at the beginning. About 1 in 5 are aged 39 to 49 and earn between $25,000 and $100,000 a year. But about 15 percent make $100,000 a year or more, slightly more than the population as a whole.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nThe point has been made before: Much of Trump\u2019s base wasn\u2019t, as speculated at the time of his victory, motivated by economic insecurity.

(Butch Dill/Associated Press)\n\nBy the time Patrick Mahomes had dropped another 375 passing yards, Michael Thomas had opened a second cellular plan and Tom Brady had outlasted Aaron Rodgers, Sunday reinforced the unusual clarity at the top of the NFL.\n\nMost years, halfway through the season is when we can start the process of determining the best teams in the league, when the picture is just beginning to come into focus. This year, after Week 9, the answer has arrived in vivid color. Championship Sunday is two and a half months away, but four teams have already defined themselves as obvious favorites to make it there. A quartet has risen to the top of the NFL, and it just happens to neatly fit into a pair of potential conference title games.\n\nIn the AFC, the New England Patriots have won six consecutive games behind their future Hall of Fame quarterback, including a victory over the otherwise unbeaten and spectacular Kansas City Chiefs. In the NFC, the New Orleans Saints have won seven consecutive games behind their future Hall of Fame quarterback, including a victory over the otherwise unbeaten and spectacular Los Angeles Rams.\n\nSunday, the Rams, Saints, Chiefs and Patriots became further ingrained as both the NFL\u2019s best teams and favored participants in the conference title games. The Chiefs minced the Cleveland Browns, 37-21, scoring at least 30 points for the eighth time in nine games. The Saints beat the Rams, 45-35, but not before the Rams showed off their firepower in temporarily erasing a 21-point deficit. Playing without star tight end Rob Gronkowski and first-round pick Sony Michel, the Patriots outclassed the Packers, 31-17.\n\n[NFL Week 9 wrap: Scores, news and analysis]\n\nThere is the class of the league. But it would be crazy to write anything in pen. This is the NFL. Surprises happen. Last season, everybody had the Patriots and Steelers ticketed for the AFC championship for months, and then the Jaguars showed up. A crop of teams this season could challenge the apparent supremacy of the Pats, Chiefs, Rams and Saints. But if any of the other 28 teams made an appearance on the season\u2019s penultimate weekend, barring a serious injury, it would come as an upset. It\u2019s rare that can be said so definitely at this stage of the season.\n\nThose four contenders have arrived here in different ways. The Chiefs turned into a monster by placing first-year starter Mahomes, an athletic marvel with a bazooka attached to his right shoulder, at the center of Coach Andy Reid\u2019s innovative, creative offensive machine.\n\nThe Saints have been on a mission since their gut-wrenching exit from the playoffs last January. They dealt a first-round pick to move up in the draft for pass rusher Marcus Davenport. Drew Brees is an MVP candidate, but the Saints are unstoppable because their offensive line mauls opponents and Thomas and Alvin Kamara are two of the best, most consistent playmakers in the NFL.\n\n[Michael Thomas\u2019s cellphone celebration \u2018brought a tear\u2019 to Joe Horn\u2019s eye]\n\nThe Patriots rebounded from horrendous losses to the Jaguars and Lions while Coach Bill Belichick tinkered and tweaked in New England, like he always does. The moves included turning return specialist and disappointing wide receiver Cordarrelle Patterson into a thumper of a running back.\n\nThe Rams splurged in the offseason to take advantage of one of quarterback Jared Goff\u2019s final rookie contract years, creating a team with unmatched star power under the helm of boy-genius Coach Sean McVay. They added pass rusher Dante Fowler at the trade deadline, but their defense remains a question \u2014 the Rams have allowed 26.7 points per game the past seven weeks. They had not lost before the Saints knocked them off Sunday, but the loss had been weeks in the making.\n\nThose four teams have separated themselves. What teams could challenge them in January? In the NFC, the obvious, yet overlooked, answer is the 6-2 Carolina Panthers. Cam Newton is playing as well as any quarterback in the league, completing a higher percentage of his passes than at any prior point of his career. Carolina is also best-positioned to steal a bye \u2014 the Panthers play the Saints twice in the final three weeks of the season.\n\nIn the AFC, the Steelers have overcome the absence of Le\u2019Veon Bell by handing the ball to second-year workhorse James Conner behind a punishing offensive line. Under fire early this year, Coach Mike Tomlin has offered a reminder that he has a Super Bowl to his name and the second-highest winning percentage among active coaches with at least 30 games coached. The Texans, now 6-3 after an 0-3 start, have taken control of the AFC South.\n\nThe 6-2 Chargers were hard to take seriously until Sunday, when they handled the surging Seahawks in Seattle. Their only two losses came against the Chiefs and Rams. Until their victory in Seattle, they had only beaten dregs. They\u2019ve maintained contact with Kansas City in the AFC West, and their pass rush will be scary once Joey Bosa returns, possibly next week. Also scary, in a different way, is their kicking game. Four kickers have combined to miss six of 22 extra points. Caleb Sturgis whiffed on two Sunday and was released Monday.\n\n[Steelers continue \u2018Le\u2019Veon who?\u2019 portion of season with a critical win over Ravens]\n\nIf there\u2019s a sleeper that might crash its way into Championship Sunday, it\u2019s a team that could follow the Jaguars\u2019 model from last year\u2019s playoffs. The Chicago Bears have a young, dominant defense, several blowout victories and an inconsistent quarterback with the odd knack for making crucial plays and randomly producing excellent performances. It\u2019s hard to see Mitchell Trubisky playing for a trip to the Super Bowl, but just last January we watched Blake Bortles do it.\n\nFor now, though, Week 9 reaffirmed what the rest of the season had already told us. The Patriots, Chiefs, Saints and Rams are in one class, and the rest of the league can be sorted out behind them. There\u2019s still another half of the regular season left, but it\u2019s hard to see that changing.\n\nRead more on the NFL:\n\nAaron Rodgers did all he could but Tom Brady won. Did anyone expect anything different?\n\nSaints and Rams show off the best the NFL has to offer\n\nThe Ravens are reeling, and they have themselves to blame", "The Pentagon has launched a preemptive strike against the Russian hackers who may have attacked the 2016 presidential election with social media influence campaigns. Numerous initiatives, including Harvard University\u2019s Defending Digital Democracy Project, have educated officials on how to fortify elections against cyberattacks and encouraged social media companies to take down fake accounts. Despite these efforts, 67 percent of Americans consider that a foreign influence campaign, either by Russia or other governments, during the midterm elections is \u201cvery or somewhat\u201d plausible.\n\nTheir worry might have some basis. There\u2019s another threat that few have worked to defend against: malware, or malicious software, designed to steal, deny or alter information. And our research strongly suggests that these attacks are underway in U.S. swing states, as we explain below.\n\nMalware has been used to attack other nations\u2019 elections\n\nMalware seeks to steal, block or alter data. It\u2019s the kind of code used to steal your passwords or credit card numbers. And it can also steal your vote.\n\nIt\u2019s recently been used in a number of other countries. With Comodo Cybersecurity malware detection data, for instance, we measured the spread of different malware types before and after the 2018 presidential elections in Turkey. The figure below shows the order in which various types of malware appear \u2014 which tells us how they are working to influence an election.\n\n\n\nMalware detection in Turkey during its 2018 election\n\nHow does this work?\n\nLet\u2019s look at such campaigns step by step. Computer hacking and human hacking both begin with reconnaissance. Who are the targets? Where are they? What are they doing? Are they open to influence? Intimidation? Every country is different. To gather information about a very large group of people, hackers have figured out that the quickest way is to use an application that a high percentage of the targets already have installed, are willing to install, or are forced to install on their computers. Ironically, one tool for this operation could be voter registration software.\n\nComputers are complex machines. Hackers take advantage of this with novel attacks that are hard to predict. In one case, Amnesty International began tweeting Nazi propaganda after someone hacked its \u201cTwitter Counter\u201d \u2014 a third-party program used to analyze Twitter followers. Such \u201cmalicious\u201d applications can be used for anything, from collecting background information on likely voters to directing their browsers to political websites.\n\nIn Turkey, the blue line shows a massive spike in the detection of malicious applications, which came six days before the call for a snap election. Next came wave after wave of computer worms (shown in green), used to distribute more serious malware like computer trojans. The orange line shows Comodo\u2019s trojan detections in Turkey, which occurred on June 21 \u2014 three days before the election.\n\n\u201cTrojan\u201d computer programs can give remote attackers full control over a victim computer. Through them, hackers can steal data, such as email; deny data, as in deleting email; and alter data, such as changing what\u2019s in an email. An attacker could send a user to a certain website or deny access to another website. In countries that allow online voting, the vote could be changed.\n\nThe malware detection timeline we found for Russia, below, is nearly identical to what we found in Turkey. First come computer and human reconnaissance via application; then, targeted malware dissemination via worm; and finally, information operations via trojan, doing anything from passively gathering intelligence to actively influencing votes.\n\n\n\nMalware detection in Russia during its 2018 presidential election\n\nTurkey and Russia are not unusual. Our research revealed that over a dozen recent national-level elections had similar malware timelines. Among the targets might be electronic ballot boxes, which are not hard to hack, having no military-grade defenses. Hopefully election officials could double-check paper ballots to set the record straight, but that is not always the case.\n\nHacker reconnaissance in the U.S. swing states\n\nSo what\u2019s happening in the United States? As of October 2018, RealClearPolitics had the following 13 U.S. states listed on the political fence: Arizona, Florida, Indiana, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota, New Jersey, Nevada, Tennessee, Texas, Wisconsin and West Virginia. And guess what? These 13 swing states are now recording more malware detections per day than the 37 non-swing states!\n\n\n\nMalware detection in the U.S.: swing states vs. non-swing states\n\nBelow is a malware timeline for Minnesota. See the massive October spike in adware? Seven other swing states have nearly identical charts. Like computer trojans, adware often seems to be doing something useful for you \u2014 but in fact, it can hide secret and malicious functionality. Often, adware tries to acquire and sell data about you, from your geolocation to a list of what websites you visit.\n\n\n\nRecent malware detections in Minnesota\n\nOur research offers strong evidence that politicians and spies are also using adware to collect information \u2014 after which they run more invasive, targeted cyber operations.\n\nWhy are spikes in malware detection troubling?\n\nWith malware, hackers can steal, deny or alter any type of digital information. Hackers can help politicians more easily win an election.\n\nAs you can see, hackers are conducting digital reconnaissance against the U.S. swing states. With that intelligence in hand, they are likely to run influence operations targeting voters, perhaps via social media. More aggressively, they might try to deceive election officials or infrastructure with false numbers or narratives.\n\nDuring the 2014 Ukrainian presidential election, hackers briefly changed the final vote tally on the official election website to a ridiculously wrong number that was immediately broadcast on Russian television. One software coder associated with the incident went missing. Since then, cyberattacks on Ukraine have manipulated its electricity grid and targeted the business sector in what was the most costly cyber incident in world history.\n\nThe United States should not assume that it is immune from such attacks.\n\nBack to our upcoming election. Donald Trump won the 2016 poll by a grand total of 107,000 votes in three key swing states \u2014 or about the same number of people who attend a home Michigan Wolverines football game. Thus, from a statistical perspective, not all that much is required to determine the winner of an election, especially given the surprising power of computer hacking and malware.\n\nKenneth Geers is a senior fellow with the Atlantic Council, a NATO Cyber Centre of Excellence Ambassador, and the chief research scientist at Comodo Cybersecurity.\n\nNadiya Kostyuk is a fellow with EastWest Institute\u2019s Global Cooperation in Cyberspace Initiative, a nonresidential fellow with the Cyber Security Project at the Belfer Center, and is completing her PhD at the University of Michigan in political science and public policy.", "BRISBANE, Australia \u2014 A shark has killed a man near an island harbor on Australia\u2019s Great Barrier Reef where two tourists were attacked on consecutive days in September, officials said.\n\nThe 33-year-old tourist suffered \u201csignificant leg and wrist injuries\u201d when he was attacked while paddleboarding near Cid Harbor on Whitsunday Island off the Queensland state coast on Monday afternoon, a Queensland Ambulance statement said.\n\nThe victim was taken by helicopter to the Mackay Base Hospital, 100 kilometers (60 miles) to the south, where his condition was listed as critical, Central Queensland Helicopter Rescue Service said in a statement.\n\nHe died in the hospital, a police statement said on Tuesday.

A saga over Germany\u2019s outgoing domestic intelligence chief that hurt the country\u2019s government has taken a new twist, with his move to another job apparently in danger. German news agency dpa reported that Maassen assailed in a farewell speech what he described as radical left-wing forces in the Social Democrats, and German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer is now considering whether to dismiss him or send him into retirement. (Michael Sohn, file/Associated Press)\n\nBERLIN \u2014 Germany\u2019s outgoing domestic intelligence chief won\u2019t be given a new government job after lashing out at one of the governing parties, the interior minister said Monday. It was a late twist to a saga that has contributed to the administration\u2019s unpopularity.\n\nThe center-left Social Democrats, part of Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s coalition, demanded Hans-Georg Maassen\u2019s removal from the BfV spy agency in September after he appeared to downplay far-right violence against migrants in the eastern city of Chemnitz.\n\nThe haggling that followed reflected poorly on a coalition already notorious for squabbling. Its leaders first agreed to make Maassen a deputy interior minister, technically a promotion with a pay rise, but renegotiated the deal in the face of a backlash.\n\nThey then agreed to make him a \u201cspecial adviser\u201d to Interior Minister Horst Seehofer.\n\nOn Monday, Seehofer said that he was sending the 55-year-old Maassen into early retirement instead.

(Mark Humphrey/AP)\n\nAfter a wild and unpredictable midterm campaign in which longtime incumbents lost to political novices, some traditionally red states became in play for Democrats (see: Texas) and a Supreme Court confirmation turned vicious, candidates have just one more day to make their closing arguments to voters.\n\nMany Americans have already voted, but most will do so Tuesday. In the past week or so, it has become clear what campaigns are prioritizing in this final push. Some Republicans, led by President Trump, have decided to go all in on a fear tactic that is largely aimed at energizing their base. Others brought out megawatt star power to make their case. Oprah Winfrey literally showed up on doorsteps in Georgia to encourage people to vote.\n\nWe\u2019ve rounded up some noteworthy closing arguments to give you a picture of where things stand as we head into the last day of campaigning.\n\nTrump and the fear factor: At rallies over the weekend, Trump continued to talk about his hard-line effort to keeps immigrants from entering the country illegally. Last week, the Trump campaign released an ad, which the president shared on Twitter, that splices video of Luis Bracamontes, an undocumented immigrant who killed two police officers, with images of a migrant caravan, intending to draw a parallel between a violent criminal and a group of people who are headed toward the U.S. southern border. It drew an immediate backlash and comparisons to the infamous Willie Horton ad.\n\nOur Washington Post colleagues Philip Rucker and Felicia Sonmez noted that although some Republicans have sought to distance themselves from Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant rhetoric, other Republicans have adopted it in their campaigns.\n\nTake Rep. Marsha Blackburn, the Republican Senate nominee in Tennessee, who has a recent ad featuring footage of the caravan and warns that it includes \u201cgang members, known criminals, people from the Middle East, possibly even terrorists.\u201d\n\nRep. Rob Woodall (R-Ga.) is running a Facebook ad featuring a photo of three tattooed Latino men with the message \u201cI will protect Georgia from violent criminal gangs.\u201d\n\nPreexisting conditions? Of course: Other Republicans in tough races are still trying to convince voters that they\u2019ve supported protections for preexisting conditions all along. In the latest twist, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R), a longtime critic of the Affordable Care Act who is helping to lead a lawsuit to kill the law, said that not only does he want those protections preserved, but he wants it done exactly as it is in the ACA.\n\n\"No matter what happens in the courts or in the Congress, in Wisconsin we\u2019ll codify that, the exact same language that\u2019s in the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Walker said. \u201cWe\u2019ll make sure everyone living with a preexisting condition is covered here in the state.\u201d\n\nAs our colleague Elise Viebeck wrote, it\u2019s a page straight out of the Trump playbook: \u201cinsisting that they will support what they once opposed with no acknowledgment of their about-face.\u201d\n\nBreaking out the star power: Democrats, meanwhile, are doing what they always do at the tail end of a campaign: trotting out the stars. An array of A-listers is working to get out the vote, but no one will top Democratic Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams\u2019s assist last week from none other than Winfrey.\n\nLady O gave an impassioned speech Thursday about why African Americans needed to work to honor those who fought for that right, and then went canvassing, shocking voters who opened their doors to find her holding a clipboard on the other side.\n\nAbrams, as well as several other Democrats in tough races, are also getting a boost from former president Barack Obama, whose presence on the trail creates a significant contrast with the current president.\n\nDire warnings: Both sides are presenting a doomsday scenario if the other side wins control of Congress. Former vice president Joe Biden said at a rally on Saturday, \u201cThe very character of our country is on the ballot on Tuesday,\u201d while Trump says \u201cDemocrats produce mobs.\u201d American political discourse has devolved so much that not only do partisans view the other side as the enemy, they also argue that their political foes are dangerous for the country.\n\nBut while Democrats raise concerns about the future of democracy under Trump and Republicans, Trump has devised an apocalyptic narrative about America with Democrats in control. Describing Trump\u2019s strategy, Rucker wrote Sunday:\n\n\u201cBut at one mega-rally after another in the run-up to Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections, Trump has taken his no-boundaries political ethos to a new level \u2014 demagoguing the Democrats in a whirl of distortion and using the power of the federal government to amplify his fantastical arguments.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s election?: This election was always going to be a referendum on Trump. Since the day he was elected, his critics looked on to 2018 as the next chance to put a check on his power. Trump knows this, and if Republicans manage to keep the House and the Senate, he will take credit for it. If they lose the House, as there is a strong chance they will do, Trump has already made clear that he will absolve himself of blame. If somehow they lose the Senate, too, it will be interesting to see how Trump responds; he has crisscrossed the country campaigning primarily for Senate candidates.\n\nSofter moments: The GOP congressman whose House district includes some Pittsburgh suburbs made a final ad that has nothing to do with policy or politics, but is clearly a reaction to the synagogue shooting on Oct. 27. Rep. Keith Rothfus\u2019s ad features black-and-white images of people and families of all races and religions with the message that we are all one America.\n\nRegardless of one\u2019s politics (and Rothfus has aligned himself with Trump on most issues), the ad was a nice antidote to the recent ugliness.", "Technology columnist\n\nAfter Apple introduced its redesigned iPad Pro as the future of computing last week, I locked up my laptop and tried using the new iPad for all my work.

But I also never figured out an efficient way to multitask, sit with decent posture and work for hours, or keep it balanced on my lap.\n\nFiling expense reports with my finger frustrated me to the point I wrote a sonnet to my missing mouse. How do I love thee? Let me count the ways. How your speed and precision fill my days.\n\n[iPhone XR Review: The best $250 you ever saved on a new phone]\n\nThe new iPad Pro, arriving in stores on Wednesday in two configurations \u2014 $800 for the 11-inch and $1,000 for the 12.9 inch \u2014 is the biggest design change and price hike ever to Apple\u2019s tablet. It might be great for artists or people who have to work mostly standing up. A substitute for a work laptop, though, it is not.\n\n\n\nThe new iPad Pro gets rid of the the home button and beefs up its processing speed. (Photo by John Brecher for The Washington Post)\n\nIronically, iPads now outsell Macs and every other laptop on the market. But that doesn\u2019t mean people are creating with them. iPads are great for watching video, playing games and reading. For that, you can spend a third as much as a big Pro on a regular $330 9.7-inch iPad, which got a speed boost and Apple Pencil stylus support this spring, though not an Apple-made keyboard case.\n\nYet Apple, eager for us to spend on pricier upgrades, is doubling down on the idea that the iPad is good for a lot more than consuming. The iPad Pro is its answer to Microsoft, which began to blend touch screens into full-powered Windows PCs and Surface devices back in 2012.\n\nApple isn\u2019t wrong to call the iPad the future. Ask any two-year-old who already knows how to use one. It just has to figure out finger-first experience for a generation raised on doing work with a mouse and trackpad.\n\n\n\nThe new Apple Pencil stylus clips with magnets to one edge of the iPad Pro. (Photo by John Brecher for The Washington Post)\n\nMore powerful than most laptops\n\nThe changes to the new iPad Pro attempt to narrow the gap with laptops by focusing on portability and power.\n\nThe home button and fingerprint reader have been replaced with the finger-swipe gestures and FaceID scanner now standard on the newest iPhones. It\u2019s mostly convenient, except when the iPad is sitting on a table and can\u2019t find your face, which happens more often than with a phone.\n\nThe reason you might want this change is that Apple filled the space where the button and cameras used to be with more glorious screen, so you end up holding less total volume. The original iPad Pro with a 12.9-inch screen was about as tall as a box of cereal, while the new version is closer to a standard sheet of paper.\n\n\n\nThe iPad Pro uses FaceID cameras hidden in the edge of the screen instead of a fingerprint reader. (Photo by John Brecher for The Washington Post)\n\nAt 1.4 pounds, the larger iPad Pro weighs a pound less than the new MacBook Air, and has a battery that lasts almost as long.\n\nThe $130 Apple Pencil stylus, available since the original, also joined in the makeover. An artist friend, who drew me a quick illustration on the new Pro with an app called Procreate, raved about its increased responsiveness. The bigger news for me is that the Pencil magnetically snaps to one side of the squared-off iPad Pro edge for storage and charging, giving me more of a fighting chance to not lose it.\n\nInside the new iPad, there\u2019s also a new A12X chip Apple says is more powerful than 92 percent of laptops available on the market. It was robust enough to handle any processing task I sent its way, including editing and sorting through thousands of photos in Adobe\u2019s Lightroom. (Next year, Adobe says it will bring to the iPad Pro a full-fledged version of its Photoshop app, too.)\n\nA new kind of port on the iPad Pro can also drive a second screen. I plugged it into my office monitor just like I do my laptop. That idea intrigued me: What if the iPad Pro had become powerful enough to be a transformer? Imagine if you could use it with fingers on the go, then get to the office and plug it into a docking station and it became a MacOS device working with big screen, keyboard and (yes!) a mouse?\n\nNope. Even driving an external monitor, the iPad Pro remains an iOS device you have to control with fingers (or Pencil) on the iPad, and run with apps designed only for iOS. The full PC transformer is actually the idea with Microsoft\u2019s Surface Pro, sold for $800 and up, which flips between touch screen and traditional desktop mode, and works with a trackpad or mouse. Apple\u2019s iPad Pro is unapologetically a finger and stylus-only machine.\n\n\n\nThe new iPad Pro works with a new Apple Pencil stylus that artists may find more responsive. (Photo by John Brecher for The Washington Post)\n\nThe finger-first experience\n\nJust because the iPad Pro is as fast as a laptop doesn\u2019t make it as useful as one.\n\nSitting inside its serviceable keyboard case, which props up the screen like a laptop, the iPad Pro can balance on a table. But on my lap it feels top-weighted, so my hands on the keyboard have to be a counterbalance. (The Surface Pro has a kickstand in the back that helps keep it from falling.)\n\n\n\nThe new iPad Pro uses the USB-C style port for charging and plugging in external devices such as a monitor. (Photo by John Brecher for The Washington Post)\n\nThere\u2019s also a posture challenge. Since you need to touch the screen to swipe through apps or select things, I couldn\u2019t quite figure out how to sit with the iPad. Hunched over? What about while writing, where the screen is propped up in that case but you still need to reach up to do things? Apple has in the past criticized other tech for causing \u201cgorilla arm syndrome\u201d with vertical touch screens, but it\u2019s done little new to address the problem here.\n\nThe iPad Pro\u2019s biggest problem is its software. In iOS 12, the iPad has some ability to make between two and four apps share the screen simultaneously, but not all apps play ball. For example, you can\u2019t make Spotify split the screen with Google Docs or Microsoft Word. Getting apps into these sharing modes also requires finger yoga that\u2019s a lot more work than moving around windows with a mouse.\n\nWhile iOS 12 has a few keyboard shortcuts that help zip between apps, what I was missing was a degree of information density. Everyone has a different way of working, but sometimes on a Mac I\u2019ll have five windows open at once, passively monitoring messages, email, Slack, Twitter and music. On the iPad, I had to keep flipping through apps in an attempt to stay tuned in. Some iPad apps don\u2019t even show you the time and battery level along the top edge.\n\n(One unexpected benefit: it\u2019s probably easier to concentrate on a single task like writing on the iPad.)\n\n\n\nNot quite a laptop, not quite a lean-back tablet, how are you supposed to sit with an iPad Pro and do work? (Photo by John Brecher for The Washington Post)\n\nMost of the best examples of professional finger and stylus-first are apps for artists who benefit the most from working on top of a screen. Too many other iPad apps are still compromises designed for very light work. There are a million little things missing: For example, the iPad app I used to make the GIF in this article \u2014 the best of a half dozen I tried \u2014 didn\u2019t give me control over the size of the final product, a critical factor for publishing that my MacOS GIF maker offers.\n\nAnd there are still lots of workplace software and websites that presume you\u2019re using a mouse or trackpad for precision pointing and selecting. It\u2019s especially true of spreadsheet or data-entry apps. My employer\u2019s expense system is one.\n\nIt\u2019s ultimately about ergonomics. I called Jack Dennerlein, a professor at Northeastern University who studies the way our bodies interface with tech. \u201cBefore the mouse and desktop computing there was a pen or pencil and paper,\u201d he reminded me. My affection for the mouse and trackpad is misplaced, he said: we put them between us and what happens on a computer screen out of technological necessity. It\u2019s actually pretty unnatural \u2014 just trying signing your name with one.\n\nWhen Apple first popularized the mouse in the 80s, people complained it required so much wrist motion. When the iPhone first arrived, people complained it lacked a physical keyboard.\n\nI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll look back on the iPad Pro in the same way, but it still has some evolving to do. Until then, bring back my mouse.\n\nRead more tech advice and analysis from Geoffrey A.

He climbed up a cliff face to escape but became trapped before reaching the top and had to call for emergency aid Friday night.\n\nThe Maritime agency said it had a rescue team at the site within 20 minutes but it took about two hours to set up and use the rope rescue system to bring the fisherman down to the beach. Officials say the fisherman, who was wearing waterproof clothing and using a headlamp for illumination, clung to the cliff for several hours before he was brought down.\n\nRescue workers then summoned a waiting lifeboat, which picked its way through the seal colony and took the fisherman to safety in Eyemouth harbor, 370 miles (nearly 600 kilometers) north of London. He was treated for exposure to the cold.\n\nCoast guard officer Jonathan Mustard said people walking along the coast should beware of seals protecting their young and make sure to have a fully charged phone so they can summon help if needed.\n\n\u201cAggressive seals are not a common occurrence and in this case they may have been protecting or defending their natural habitat and their young,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to say the beach was in southeastern Scotland.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

On Oct. 29, the Pentagon announced that some 5,000 troops would head to the border \u2014 a move that includes \u201cair and ground transportation and logistics support,\u201d \u201ccombat engineering battalions\u201d and \u201cmedical support units,\u201d along with surveillance technology and expeditionary housing for CBP personnel.\n\nThe U.S. government hopes, it seems, that the \u201cshow of force\u201d will dissuade the caravan of 3,500 to 7,000 migrants marching through Central America into Mexico from attempting to cross into the United States.\n\nCritics accuse the Trump administration of \u201cwagging the dog,\u201d using the military to concoct a threat that will galvanize Republican and swing voters days before a highly contested election \u2014 the president himself calls the midterms a \u201creferendum\u201d on his performance in office. Supporters contend the military presence is necessary to defend U.S. national security and sovereignty.\n\n[Does separating families at the border discourage immigration? Here\u2019s what the research says.]\n\nAmericans count on an apolitical, nonpartisan military to help maintain our democracy. Here\u2019s why this deployment raises concerns that the military is being drawn dangerously far into politics:\n\n1. This level of deployment has no operational rationale\n\nMilitary forces clearly overmatch the migrants. Combining the initial projection of 5,200 fresh troops with the previously deployed 2,092 National Guardsmen renders a troop-to-asylum-seeker ratio of almost 2 to 1, and the ratio may grow larger as weary marchers peel away from the caravan.\n\nEven with its hiring problems, the Border Patrol\u2019s firepower, logistics, mobility and communications \u2014 even without the reinforcements \u2014 far exceed the capabilities of the group of individuals and families traveling on foot, who perhaps have cellphones and clothes but little else.\n\n2. Americans think highly of the military \u2014 and politicians know this\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time the military\u2019s credibility with the American public has been used to underwrite electoral goals. And the social desirability of supporting U.S. troops means that they can be used as human shields against political criticism. But debates about the operational logic of this deployment obscure the more profound effect such decisions may have on the military\u2019s domestic political role.\n\n[A significant minority of Americans say they could support a military takeover of the U.S. government]\n\nThe military is one of the few institutions a comfortable majority of Americans still admire \u2014 military approval has not dipped below 70 percent in the past 10 years. Trump counts the military among his supporters and surrounded himself with retired and active-duty general officers early in his administration. He boasted after the 2016 election that the military voted for him overwhelmingly and rallied audiences on military bases to shout anti-media chants.\n\n3. Deploying the military on domestic soil has long been controversial\n\nTrump\u2019s border moves have generated considerable controversy among military veterans.\n\nThroughout U.S. history, civilians in and out of government have generally acknowledged that neither service members nor politicians should use the military as a domestic coercive or policing instrument. This is explicitly forbidden by the Posse Comitatus.\n\nWhy is this a worry? In the extreme, routinizing the use of the military to advance political goals raises concerns about a slippery slope toward political violence and even coups. If officers and their institutions are used to legitimize a domestic political agenda, partisans eventually could threaten opponents with force, not just electoral losses. Coups evolve when the military itself, in an effort to protect its own interests, uses its coercive power to assume control of the government.\n\n[Trump may put 5 military officers in top posts. That\u2019s unprecedented.]\n\nHave Americans ever had to seriously worry about a military coup? Thankfully the answer is \u201cno.\u201d Moreover, Posse Comitatus prevents domestic uses of military force, and presidents tend to refrain from using the military in ways explicitly tied to elections.\n\n4. The scale and timing are what make this deployment different\n\nThere have been cases where presidents deploy forces in election years \u2014 including deployments of troops to the southern border by George W. Bush and Barack Obama in midterm years (in 2006 and 2010, respectively).\n\nWhat makes this troop deployment different is not only the scale, which Trump seems to be ratcheting up daily, but also its timing immediately before the midterms and its political context.\n\nTrump\u2019s decision midweek to deploy even more troops \u2014 \u201canywhere between 10,000 and 15,000 military personnel\u201d \u2014 likely cues off polls showing Republican voters have concerns about immigration. The administration has been arguing for weeks that immigrants, and the migrant caravan in particular, are a threat. \u201cThis is an invasion of our Country and our Military is waiting for you!\u201d was the message in one presidential tweet. The president blames Democrats for lax immigration policies and lax border security.\n\nThe migrant caravan is some 900 miles \u2014 or 300 hours of walking time \u2014 south of the most southern section of the U.S. border. Militarizing the southern border over the past week appears to be a dramatic gesture to heighten the perception of public threat, and perhaps rally Republicans into voting booths on Tuesday.\n\n5. In a polarized age, the deployment risks further politicizing the military\n\nCandidates for high office have sought officer endorsements for years, including during the last election cycle. Critics argue that deepening the military\u2019s role in electoral politics promotes narrow rather than national interests. If such abuses continue, the military could become affiliated with one party \u2014 or become a political tool for whichever party occupies the position of commander in chief.\n\nThe public foundations for this outcome are already in place. In a paper presented at the American Political Science Association meeting this August, Peter Feaver and Jim Golby observed that their surveys and others show \u201cpublic confidence in the military is significantly conditioned on partisanship and political ideology.\u201d In other words, a person who identifies as a Republican has, on average, far more confidence in the military than someone who identifies as a Democrat. But Golby and others also found that strong partisans in the United States express greater confidence in the military when a member of their own party is president \u2014 and Democrats\u2019 confidence in the military increases especially dramatically when a Democrat is president.\n\nFor Americans\u2019 faith in their armed forces to shift with the political fortunes of their own party is something to be concerned about, potentially politicizing the military and bringing a civil-military dynamic that is unhealthy for U.S. democracy.\n\nAlice Hunt Friend is a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a PhD candidate at American University\u2019s School of International Service.

The results Monday dashed the ruling party\u2019s ambitions for greater power nationally and showed the flaws of the party\u2019s courtship of the far right.\n\nIn mayoral races in 649 cities, towns and smaller municipalities, official results released Monday showed that Poland\u2019s ruling right-wing Law and Justice party, in power since 2015, won no big city and only a handful of the smaller cities. The largest city captured by the conservatives was Zamosc, population 65,000.\n\nMichal Szuldrzynski, a leading editor with the Rzeczpospolita daily, said Law and Justice\u2019s results in the mid-size cities \u2014 normally bastions of the political right \u2014 were \u201ccatastrophic\u201d for the governing party. He argued in an opinion piece the results indicated that Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki and the ruling party have \u201cfailed to regain a moderate center and build up support among the middle class.\u201d\n\nAmong the factors that have alienated many voters are Morawiecki\u2019s \u201cflirting with the most radical part of the electorate,\u201d with gestures and words meant to appeal to far-right nationalists, Szuldrzynski argued.\n\nHe also listed disputes with the European Union over rule of law issues and a controversial Holocaust speech law early this year that sparked a clash with Israel, which in his view was Poland\u2019s most serious diplomatic crisis since communism fell in 1989.\n\nFormer Prime Minister Donald Tusk, now head of the European Council, said in Warsaw that he was \u201cvery surprised\u201d by the scale of Law and Justice\u2019s defeat in smaller cities. He said the result was a warning to the ruling party and a boost to the opposition Civic Platform party, which he used to lead.\n\nIn the first round of local voting on Oct. 21, an opposition coalition led by the centrist Civic Platform won outright in the capital, Warsaw, and in other key cities, including Wroclaw, Poznan and Lodz.\n\nIn runoff races Sunday, voters handed landslide victories to opposition politicians in other prestigious cities, including Krakow, Gdansk and Kielce.\n\nWhile the opposition celebrated Monday, ruling party leaders sought to keep the focus on the party\u2019s strong showing in Poland\u2019s regional assemblies two weeks ago.\n\nLaw and Justice \u201cwon the local elections of 2018,\u201d the deputy culture minister, Jaroslaw Sellin, told TVN24. \u201cIt won them like nobody has managed to do yet.\u201d\n\nThe mayoral results, however, clearly reflected the strong opposition of urban Poles to Law and Justice, which has been accused of violating democratic standards with attempts to take control of the courts and turn public media into a party propaganda tool. The Law and Justice government has also been in frequent conflict with the EU over democratic standards.\n\nThe results in Poland\u2019s mayoral races have proven a boost to Civic Platform and other opposition parties. However, many analysts warned that their relatively decent showing resulted largely from votes against the ruling party, and said that if the opposition wants a chance of governing the country it will need to increase its appeal. The opposition\u2019s defeat in some places to independent candidates seemed to reflect their vulnerability.\n\nOverall, the local election highlighted the deep political divisions in Poland.\n\nOn one side are urban, liberal Poles who feel that the ruling populists are destroying their country\u2019s hard-won democracy.\n\nOn the other are conservatives \u2014 often older, rural and less educated voters \u2014 who appreciate the ruling party\u2019s attempts to preserve traditional Catholic values and resist what they feel are corrupting influences from Western Europe.\n\n___\n\nMonika Scislowska in Warsaw contributed.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The big-name budget carrier announced losses recently despite the boom in India\u2019s aviation industry. (Sajjad Hussain/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe prime selfie spot for residents of this central Indian city isn\u2019t its decaying 16th-century royal fort or its world-famous marble market. It\u2019s the terminal at Kishangarh Airport \u2014 a small, low-slung building that offers a new gateway to the world.\n\nAir travel from the dusty boomtown has become cheaper than renting a car, Devi Singh, a 77-year-old retired soldier from Kishangarh, told his friends over tea one recent morning, discussing the $35 no-frills one-way fare to New Delhi that launched last month.\n\n\u201cEven the sweepers can afford to fly now,\u201d he said.\n\nKishangarh is one of 34 airports opened in the past 18 months in India, whose aviation sector has exploded in the wake of massive economic growth. In September, the civil aviation minister said that $60 billion has been budgeted for 100 more in the next 10 to 15 years.\n\nAs millions of newly wealthy Indians take to the skies for the first time each year, the country is scrambling to transform colonial-era airstrips into plush airports, and suddenly stretched airlines are investing in new planes and recruiting foreign pilots.\n\n[India is no longer home to the largest number of poor people in the world. Nigeria is.]\n\n\n\nSchoolchildren celebrate the opening last month of an airport in Kishangarh, 200 miles by road from New Delhi. (Kishangarh Airport)\n\n\u201cIn the 70 years since independence, just 400 planes were serving us,\u201d Prime Minister Narendra Modi said as he unveiled an airport cut into the Himalayan mountains at Pakyong, in Sikkim state, in September \u2014 his second such opening that month. \u201cIn the past year alone, airline companies have ordered 1,000 new airplanes.\u201d\n\nA relative blip at the turn of the millennium, India\u2019s aviation market has become a juggernaut. In October, its airlines marked 48 consecutive months of double-digit growth in traffic, according to the International Air Transport Association. By 2024, the IATA estimates, India will rank behind only China and the United States in terms of air traffic to, from and within the country.\n\n\u201cTwenty years ago, India\u2019s market was so minuscule, it barely even figured in,\u201d said Dinesh Keskar, Boeing\u2019s senior vice president of sales for Asia-Pacific and India for commercial airplanes. \u201cIn the near future, we think one in 20 planes will be sold to India.\u201d\n\nThe demand for airports is driven, in part, by new affluence in second- and third-tier cities such as Kishangarh.\n\nIn the 1990s, the small, family-run marble companies here turned into multinational corporations, generating wealth that lifted the whole population. Even as it retains its sleepy, small-town vibe, the city draws billionaires\u2019 wives, cricket champions and television stars looking to decorate homes, temples and malls \u2014 and who now arrive for their marble-shopping visits on chartered private planes or helicopters rather than by car or train.\n\nTraders anticipate that the new commercial air connection to Delhi will bring even more customers wanting marble tiles for walls and floors. A single 78-passenger flight should bring an additional $400,000 a day in revenue, according to Suresh Tak, president of the Kishangarh Marble Association.\n\nTwo weeks after the first commercial flight began, the novelty of the airport was already wearing off for residents and the possibilities were sinking in.\n\n\u201cWhat we really need now is a flight to Mumbai,\u201d said one of Singh\u2019s soldier friends, sipping tea.\n\n\u201cNo, we want Kishangarh to Jaipur in 15 minutes,\u201d said another.\n\nSuch surging demand should, in theory, lead to profits for India\u2019s airlines. In practice, though, the companies are struggling to cash in because of a combination of surging fuel prices, a weak rupee and fierce competition that keeps ticket prices low.\n\n\u201cAll this talk of India as the third-largest aviation market may not happen, because the infrastructure may not be able to come up,\u201d said aviation journalist Neelam Matthews.\n\nIn July, share prices of InterGlobe Aviation, the parent company of India\u2019s biggest airline, IndiGo, plunged 10 percent when it announced quarterly results showing a 97 percent dip in net profits since the previous year. SpiceJet, another big-brand budget carrier, announced net losses of $5 million in its June quarter.\n\nDespite the cash crunch, big airlines are under government pressure to expand services even on financially risky routes.\n\n\n\nIn 2017, Modi, eager to promote affordable aviation as part of a huge package of social improvements, launched the Regional Connectivity Scheme, which aims to connect small Indian towns to the aviation map through subsidized new routes.\n\n[India launches \u2018Modicare,\u2019 the world\u2019s biggest government health program]\n\nThe program is one element of the prime minister\u2019s broader infrastructure push \u2014 also including a $17 billion bullet train and 53,000 miles of new roads \u2014 to showcase India\u2019s gleaming modernity in a scramble for global superpower status.\n\nBut in the aviation sector, at least, those lofty ambitions have been accompanied \u2014 and tempered \u2014 by disarray.\n\nAir Deccan and Air Odisha, which collectively bagged 84 of the 128 contracts offered in the first phase of the new connectivity program, canceled more than half their flights in September, according to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA).\n\nEmbarrassingly, one of the airports Modi personally inaugurated in September, in the industrial town of Jharsuguda, had flights for only two weeks before abruptly halting operations. An official at the Airports Authority of India, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to the media, said the flights were stopped because of internal problems at Air Odisha and would be resumed soon.\n\nMeanwhile, as small towns struggle to set up new routes, major airports are beset with delays and cancellations.\n\nMumbai Airport, India\u2019s busiest, reported delays on one in four of its domestic flights in September, according to the DGCA. And like New Delhi\u2019s airport, it is running out of landing slots, making it impossible to add new routes.\n\nFor the millions of Indians being initiated into their country\u2019s new aviation era each year, the experience can be chaotic and unglamorous. But for Gyana Devi, a 51-year-old schoolteacher flying for the first time on a wobbly Bombardier jet to her hometown of Kishangarh, it is also magical.\n\n\u201cI will show everyone at home,\u201d she said as she filmed a video of her first time above the clouds.\n\nRead more\n\nModi inaugurates world\u2019s tallest statue in India\n\nWant to stay healthy while flying?

Last year, she called him an \u201cimmoral pig\u201d after he signed an executive order banning citizens of seven majority-Muslim countries from entering the United States in January 2017 and criticized his response to Hurricane Maria\u2019s devastation in Puerto Rico.\n\nWeeks before the 2016 election, Rihanna was spotted wearing a T-shirt with a photograph of Hillary Clinton\u2019s face screenprinted on it. After Trump\u2019s inauguration, she showed up at the Women\u2019s March in New York in a pink sweatshirt and matching tutu and dabbed in front of Trump Tower.\n\nBut can she actually stop Trump from playing her music?\n\nThe answer is complicated. When a politician wants to use a song as background music at a rally, their campaign needs a public performance license from the copyright holder of the musical composition, rather than one from the recording artist, intellectual property lawyer Danwill Schwender explained in a 2017 article in \u201cAmerican Music,\u201d a scholarly journal published by the University of Illinois Press. Radio and TV ads are another story \u2014 the owner of the sound recording, typically the artist\u2019s label, will need to license the song to the campaign.\n\nIn the United States, the copyrights for most musical compositions are administered by one of two performance rights organizations: The American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) or Broadcast Music Inc. (BMI), which represent 23.5 million songs between them. In 2012, BMI created a separate license for political entities, Schwender wrote, which allows musicians to opt out if they don\u2019t want their songs used at rallies. ASCAP has a similar provision in place, according to NPR.\n\n[From Elton John to Eminem to Peggy Lee: Trump\u2019s bizarre history with pop music]\n\nMusicians from Adele to Neil Young have requested that Trump stop playing their songs at his campaign stops, and some have taken advantage of that clause. In October 2015, Aerosmith frontman Steven Tyler demanded that the Trump campaign stop playing \u201cDream On\u201d at rallies, and BMI pulled public performance rights for the song. (Trump\u2019s Aug. 21 rally in Charleston, W. Va., featured Aerosmith\u2019s \u201cLivin' On the Edge,\u201d prompting another cease-and-desist letter from Tyler.) Similarly, after the Republican National Convention licensed Queen\u2019s \u201cWe Are the Champions\u201d in 2016, the band chose to exclude the song from being used for future political events.\n\nAs The Post\u2019s Amy B Wang reported last week after Pharrell Williams asked Trump to stop using his 2013 hit \u201cHappy\u201d at political events, the ASCAP warns politicians that even if a campaign has obtained a license to use a song, they should still get the artist\u2019s permission. According to the ASCAP\u2019s guidelines, disgruntled artists could file suit under the Lanham Act, which is intended to prevent the dilution of a brand\u2019s trademark through unauthorized use or under \u201cright of publicity\u201d laws which provides image protection for well-known artists in some states.\n\nBut as Forbes\u2019s Melinda Newman wrote, \u201cThe problem is that both of these are untested as far as campaign usages since no artist or songwriter seems to have ever taken a case to trial citing a violation by a campaign\u2014or at least as far as we could find. \"\n\nMeanwhile, Trump famously likes to end his rallies with the Rolling Stones\u2019 \u201cYou Can\u2019t Always Get What You Want,\u201d even though it\u2019s against the band\u2019s wishes. And there\u2019s not much the group can do to stop him, Mick Jagger said in 2016.\n\n\u201cSo, the thing is, when you appear in America . . . if you\u2019re in a public place like Madison Square Garden or a theater, you can play any music you want, and you can\u2019t be stopped,\u201d Jagger said in a question-and-answer session on Twitter. \u201cSo, if you write a song and someone plays it in a restaurant that you go to, you can\u2019t stop them. They can play what they want.\u201d\n\nMost of the typical venues for campaign events, such as arenas and convention centers, will already have a blanket license from a performance rights organization in place, Schwender wrote. And that\u2019s why \u201cSweet Child O\u2019 Mine\u201d gets played at Trump rallies despite Guns N\u2019 Roses\u2019 requests to the contrary, Axl Rose said on Sunday.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately the Trump campaign is using loopholes in the various venues\u2019 blanket performance licenses which were not intended for such craven political purposes, without the songwriters\u2019 consent,\u201d he wrote on Twitter.\n\nJust so ya know... GNR like a lot of artists opposed to the unauthorized use of their music at political events has formally requested r music not b used at Trump rallies or Trump associated events. \u2014 Axl Rose (@axlrose) November 4, 2018\n\nIn his article, Schwender noted that the RNC could theoretically use a convention center\u2019s license to play Queen\u2019s \u201cWe Are the Champions\u201d and argue that the venue\u2019s license supersedes the campaign\u2019s license \u2014 or lack thereof.\n\n\u201cAlthough a BMI spokesperson stated that doing so \u2018would not be appropriate,\u2019 the use of a song as random backdrop music as opposed to a campaign\u2019s \u2018theme music' may alter the analysis,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe courts have not yet tested this argument.\u201d\n\nFor musicians, there\u2019s little financial reward in chasing such a lawsuit. And it\u2019s always possible that the campaign might voluntarily choose to stop playing Rihanna\u2019s music after her request, as they did for Young in 2015. But in the meantime, Rihanna\u2019s stance has earned her praise from some Democratic politicians.\n\n\u201cGood for @rihanna,\u201d wrote Rep. Eric Swalwell (Calif.) on Twitter. \u201c@realDonaldTrump also picked the wrong song. Wouldn\u2019t \u2018Russian Roulette\u2019 or \u2018Rude Boy\u2019 better suit him anyways?\u201d\n\nMore from Morning Mix:\n\nIndian hunters track down and kill tiger linked to 13 deadly attacks, angering conservationists\n\n\u2018I wanted him to feel compassion\u2019: The Jewish nurse who treated the synagogue shooting suspect tells his story\n\nNovelist Stephen King has \u2018personal reasons\u2019 for wanting \u2018racist dumbbell\u2019 Steve King out of office", "The horror writer Stephen King probably didn\u2019t intend his story \u201cGraveyard Shift,\u201d first published in 1970, to be a metaphor for political depravity.

He took to Twitter last year to declare his support for ethnic nationalism, writing, \u201cWe can\u2019t restore our civilization with somebody else\u2019s babies,\u201d His party didn\u2019t rebuke him in June when he retweeted a message from a self-described \u201cNazi sympathizer.\u201d Last month, he voiced support for Faith Goldy, an unsuccessful Toronto mayoral candidate who has promoted the baseless notion that a \u201cwhite genocide\u201d is underway. And last week, reports surfaced that King had met in August with members of an Austrian political party founded by former Nazis, during a trip funded by a group that promotes awareness of the Holocaust.\n\nAt a town hall last week, King erupted when an attendee asked him whether his hard-line views on race and identity bore resemblance to those of the Robert Bowers, the man accused of gunning down 11 congregants at a Pittsburgh synagogue.\n\n[Rep. Steve King erupts as his immigration views are compared to the Pittsburgh shooting suspect\u2019s]\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re done. You crossed the line.

What this year\u2019s polls seemed to underline was the danger to the NLD of a weak voter turnout, which was probably behind the upset defeat of an NLD candidate for a Yangon regional parliament seat.

As state television aired footage of military forces staging war exercises Monday, Rouhani said Iran is in an \u201ceconomic war situation.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will proudly break the sanctions,\u201d Rouhani said during a meeting of government officials in the Iranian capital.\n\nIn Washington, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said: \u201cThe Iranian regime has a choice. It can either do a 180-degree turn from its outlaw course of action and act like a normal country, or it can see its economy crumble.\u201d\n\nIt will take many weeks or months before the effectiveness of the administration\u2019s maximum-pressure campaign against Iran can be judged. But what already is clear is that the renewed sanctions will be greeted by threats hurled between Washington and Tehran as the two governments grow more confrontational.\n\n\u201cWe should look at today as the first day of an escalating maximum-pressure campaign, not a new status quo,\u201d said Richard Goldberg, an adviser at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. \u201cWe\u2019re going to see an enormous amount of pressure brought to bear on the regime, to the point where it may have to consider negotiating with the Trump administration or the regime will collapse.\u201d\n\nThe sanctioning of hundreds of Iranian individuals, companies and organizations was the final result of President Trump\u2019s decision in May to withdraw from the nuclear deal, known officially as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).\n\nThe sanctions target Iranian oil, banks and shipping companies. But many prominent banks and companies were left off the list of more than 700 names, as well as entire sectors like mining and computer sciences, suggesting a strategic decision to hold back some names for future sanctions.\n\n[U.S. lowers sanctions boom on Iran again]\n\nEight nations were given temporary waivers, including Iran\u2019s two biggest oil customers, China and India. Turkey, which buys natural gas from Iran, also was exempted from sanctions. Waivers also were given to projects underway at three nuclear power plants related to impeding Iran\u2019s ability to reverse course and restart its nuclear program.\n\nU.S. officials say their goal is to force the Iranian government to stop its support of militants in the region and, eventually, renegotiate the nuclear agreement forged by the Obama administration.\n\nBut it is uncertain whether Iran would bend to American will under another round of pressure or whether it can afford to simply wait until there is a new U.S. president.\n\n[The people of Iran, not the mullahs, will feel the pain of sanctions most]\n\nPatrick Clawson, an Iran expert at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said he met Iranians at a recent conference in Moscow whom he described as confident they could ride out the latest wave of sanctions.\n\n\u201c \u2018We can outlast Trump\u2019 was a big theme,\u201d he said.\n\nBut in Tehran, some residents expressed worries about the future.\n\nOne man, a 45-year-old manual laborer, said in a telephone interview that low salaries and high inflation mean that his family \u201ccannot travel even to our own villages\u201d to visit relatives. He spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of government reprisal.\n\n\u201cI work two shifts now, including the weekends, and we buy whatever we can afford without worrying about the quality,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother resident, a 30-year-old woman who works at a private distribution company, said by phone that she pays exorbitant amounts on the black market for prescription medicine for her parents. She also spoke on the condition of anonymity so she could speak freely about conditions in Iran.\n\nNeither Iran nor the United States \u201cwants the best for the Iranian people,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I don\u2019t have any hope.\u201d\n\nRouhani boasted of Iran\u2019s ability to keep selling oil even with sanctions in place.\n\n\u201cThe fact that the U.S. has exempted eight countries from the sanctions after they threatened to bring Iran oil exports to zero, isn\u2019t this a victory for us? And isn\u2019t this a retreat for the United States?\u201d he said. \u201cThe Islamic Republic of Iran can sell its oil and will sell its oil even if the eight countries had not been exempted from the sanctions.\u201d\n\nIranian retaliation, if any, could come through its militant proxies in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen, or in the Persian Gulf, where oil tankers and U.S. Navy vessels ply the waters.\n\n\u201cThey have a history of hacking the Saudi infrastructure, and they can attack the U.S. infrastructure,\u201d he said. \u201cI worry about them wreaking havoc on major corporations or financial institutions,\u201d said Cliff Kupchan, chairman of the Eurasia Group, a political risk consulting firm.\n\nKelsey Davenport, director of nonproliferation policy for the Arms Control Association, said there is danger of the U.S. overreacting to Iranian rhetoric.\n\nIran \u201cwill continue to remind the international community that if the deal collapses or it no longer benefits Iran, it can ramp up its nuclear activity,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s critical to distinguish between the rhetoric and steps that actually violate the deal.\u201d\n\nIt is unclear whether the reimposed sanctions, which are opposed by all but a handful of countries in the world, will signal the end of the nuclear deal.\n\nBritain, France, Russia, China and Germany, which all negotiated alongside the United States, insist they want to keep it going. Iran has said it could walk away and resume its nuclear program, a step few expect Tehran to take.\n\n\u201cTehran must calculate what gives them more leverage, sticking to the JCPOA or resuming their frozen nuclear activities,\u201d said Karim Sadjadpour, a policy analyst with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \u201cIn the former scenario, they risk appearing feckless; in the latter scenario, they risk appearing reckless.\u201d\n\nThe European Union is attempting to devise an alternative \u201cspecial purpose vehicle\u201d to continue trade with Iran, but it has had trouble finding a country willing to host it. Even the Europeans, who consider the nuclear deal essential to their national security, may be softening their support after Danish officials accused Iran of trying to assassinate an Arab separatist leader living in Denmark.\n\nPompeo said that \u201cmultiple lines of effort\u201d are being deployed to pressure Tehran and that this week\u2019s listings are not the last word.

Smith, a former adviser in the Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control, which monitors sanctions compliance. \u201cMore sanctions and enforcement are the two screw-tightening exercises the U.S. government has.

(AFP/Getty Images)\n\nAmid all the forecasts for congressional elections, one central thing is missing: a forecast for state legislatures. Fortunately, political scientist Carl Klarner has regularly forecasted all the state legislative races and has just published his final forecasts. He answered a few questions via email.\n\nWhat\u2019s the current landscape of partisan control of state legislatures? How big of an advantage does the Republican Party have going into the election?\n\nWe live in a pretty evenly divided country politically. But despite that, twice as many Americans (61 percent) live in states where both legislative chambers have Republican majorities than where both chambers are blue (30 percent) \u2014 with the rest (9 percent) living in states where one party controls one chamber each. Republicans swept into many state legislatures in 2010 \u2014 most notably in Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and North Carolina \u2014 and haven\u2019t been dislodged since.\n\nIn layperson\u2019s terms, how exactly do you forecast a state legislative outcome? What factors do you take into account?\n\nYou take things that can be measured before an election, and, via statistical modeling, look at how those things are related to election outcomes in the past. Then you take those same factors, measure them in the current election, and in light of their relationship to past elections, forecast this election.\n\nMy analysis is at the district level. That allows you to take the translation of votes into seats into account. Because of gerrymandering and just where people happen to live, the Democrats commonly get more than 50 percent of the votes for state legislature, but not a majority of state legislative seats.\n\nThe starting point is the partisan split in the vote in a district in the last election, and then you see what factors are associated with a change in the vote. One such factor is incumbency \u2014 including whether an incumbent retired as well as whether an incumbent is now running but wasn\u2019t in the last election.\n\nAnother important factor is the \u201cpartisan tide.\u201d Whether people say they\u2019ll vote for a Republican or Democrat in U.S. House elections \u2014 a.k.a. the \u201cgeneric ballot\u201d \u2014 is the main part of this. That percentage has been associated with a shift across the country in how many votes each party gets in state legislative races.\n\nWhat are the highlights of your current forecasts? How many state legislatures might shift in a consequential way?\n\nMy most recent forecasts say that the Democrats will take seven chambers, while the forecast two months ago was they would take nine chambers. The most important pickups for the Democrats could be in the Michigan House and Senate and the North Carolina Senate, which are toss-ups according to the model.\n\nA Democratic takeover of the Michigan state legislature would be particularly noteworthy, since they are also favored to win the gubernatorial race. There have only been two times since 1974 that a complete partisan shift in both legislative chambers and the governor\u2019s mansion has occurred: Maine and Wisconsin, both in 2010.\n\nIn addition, the Maine and New York Senates are very likely to flip blue, while the Arizona, Colorado and New Hampshire state senates are toss-ups. The state houses in Arizona, New Hampshire and West Virginia are also toss-ups.\n\nMany people have noted that a good showing for Democrats might position them to control the redistricting process after 2020? Do you see any signs that this could happen?\n\nI think it\u2019s likely nonpartisan redistricting will pass in Michigan this year, so Democratic gains in the legislature probably won\u2019t matter for redistricting. The same is true in Arizona, where a nonpartisan commission already draws district lines. In North Carolina, a Democratic takeover of either chamber would be extremely important for redistricting, as the governor can\u2019t veto redistricting bills.\n\nFor the most part, the maps Republicans drew after their 2010 sweep are effective enough that the GOP is likely to maintain control in the Florida, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin state legislatures, unless one of these states institutes nonpartisan redistricting. Chances of this reform basically died in the Pennsylvania legislature earlier this year, however.\n\nAnd now the obligatory post-2016 questions: What makes you most cautious about your forecasts?\n\nThis is my favorite question! Here\u2019s one important thing.\n\nFor the final forecast, I use a strict decision rule to pick the generic ballot number: use the last survey that ended before Oct. 29 that used either registrants or all adults as its sampling frame. This helps ensure consistency with historical polls and avoids issues with how to determine \u201clikely voters\u201d or how exactly to aggregate different polls with different methodologies. Most importantly, using a consistent rule means you can\u2019t cherry-pick the poll you want.\n\nIn this case, the last poll I picked was an Oct. 21-23 Economist/YouGov poll. I calculated the percentage who chose the Democratic House candidate among those intending to vote for a Democrat or Republican (thus excluding undecided voters or those who planned to vote for a third-party or other candidate). This figure was 53.4 percent. But the comparable statistic from the 538 poll aggregation on Oct. 22 was 54.5 percent, suggesting a larger Democratic advantage.\n\nSo it is possible that this forecast is too pessimistic for Democrats. But I think it\u2019s important to stick to a consistent decision rule regardless.", "TODAY\u2019S DAILY DIGIT\n\n4/10: Wet and raw, although rain will taper off in the afternoon.\n\nEXPRESS FORECAST\n\nToday: Rain, diminishing in the afternoon.

(Ra\u00fal Vera)\n\nThey fall asleep on borrowed blankets, curled up on a floor someone has loaned for the night. They share meals of chicken soup and tortillas. They wash laundry in rivers or sinks, and when they fall sick after more than 20 days on the road, the people in the migrant caravan turn to the nuns trailing them with medicines and bandages.\n\nWith 4,000 to 5,000 people, the first and largest group trudging slowly to the U.S. border is bigger than some of the municipalities it has descended on in Mexico, doubling their population overnight. They are fleeting guests, a gathering bound by a single goal: seeking asylum or work in the United States.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s practically a walking town,\u201d said Edgar Corzo Sosa, a national human rights official in Mexico monitoring the caravan. As he spoke this weekend, the group was traveling through the southern state of Veracruz, several hundred miles southeast of Mexico City.\n\nLike any town, the caravan has had its share of milestones and tragedies. Babies have been born, one man died after falling from a crowded truck, and several women have had miscarriages, according to Mexico\u2019s Red Cross and rights officials. The migrants rise together at dawn, travel in clumps of families or friends from the same hometowns and hold nightly assemblies to decide where to go next.\n\n[Will caravans become \u2018new method\u2019 of migration?]\n\nIt can be a fragile alliance, frayed by exhaustion and uncertainty \u2014 and they had hoped it would have ended by now, with buses ferrying them to Mexico City and then north to the U.S. border. But the buses never came.\n\nBy Sunday, the caravan had split into groups, as faster-moving travelers hitched rides and jumped ahead on the route. At sunrise, more than 1,500 left the small city of Isla and headed toward Cordoba, also in Veracruz but closer to the capital, while others had scattered into the neighboring state of Puebla and other cities along the way.\n\nMost of the migrants are from crime-ridden Honduras, where the caravan hastily assembled in mid-October as people jumped at the chance to travel safely through Mexico without having to pay smugglers thousands of dollars. Since then, some have turned back. Others have sought asylum in Mexico.\n\nStill others have walked until their shoes fell off along the long, hot road.\n\nTheir movements are coordinated by megaphone-wielding members of the U.S.-Mexican activist collective Pueblo Sin Fronteras, although organizers say the caravan governs itself. But the crowds also depend on Mexican cities and towns that offer up community centers where they can sleep and church groups willing to slap together tamales and barbecue in the middle of the night.\n\nPresident Trump has portrayed the caravan \u2014 and others forming behind it \u2014 as \u201cvery bad thugs and gang members,\u201d noting that on Oct. 19, thousands of migrants had pushed and kicked their way through a border gate from Guatemala to Mexico. His claims were inflamed on the Internet by misleading images, including one of a bloodied Mexican police officer that was taken elsewhere in 2012.\n\nTrump has ordered thousands of troops to the southern border and has said he would consider sending as many as 15,000 \u2014 roughly the size of the U.S. military\u2019s presence in Afghanistan.\n\nIn Mexico, police and government human rights observers say they have seen no examples of terrorists or extreme violence.\n\n\u201cHe can say a thousand things,\u201d Corzo Sosa said of Trump\u2019s claims about bad actors. \u201cWe\u2019re here in the caravan. . . . We haven\u2019t identified any.\u201d\n\n[Army assessment of migrant caravans undermines Trump\u2019s rhetoric]\n\nOn Friday, shortly after they crossed into the state of Veracruz, home to stunning beaches but also deadly cartel-fueled violence, rain-soaked migrants cheered when Gov. Miguel Angel Yunes said he would provide buses to take them to Mexico City.\n\nBut Yunes quickly changed his mind, citing a water shortage in the capital. Critics claimed he was pressured to stand down to avoid a clash at the U.S. border before the U.S. elections on Tuesday.\n\nDejected, the migrants headed north the next day on blistered feet, taking a narrow ribbon of road one organizer said is a frequent site of robberies and attacks, calling it the \u201croute of death.\u201d\n\nPueblo Sin Fronteras urged them to stick together. But some rushed to hitch rides on tractor-trailer trucks, cramming into the open doors or clinging to the sides.\n\nOscar Lopez, 31, hung back with his wife and three children, including 3-year-old Elias, who sat in a stroller wearing blue Crocs adorned with racecars.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s dangerous,\u201d Lopez, 31, said shaking his head as others hoisted themselves into the truck. In the tumult of the caravan, his 12-year-old son went missing for 33 hours, he said, and he wasn\u2019t willing to risk it again.\n\nAs they waited for safer rides, the food brigade swooped in from Our Lady of the Rosary Church.\n\nThe night before, the church\u2019s young priest, Joel Campechano, had alerted his parish over WhatsApp that the caravan was coming. The next day, parishioners served homemade tamales, pots of rice and tortillas.\n\nOne of the volunteers was Marta Murgia, 43, who wore a hot-pink apron with a picture of Jesus. \u201cI wonder what\u2019s waiting for them,\u201d she said of the families passing by.\n\nDown the road went the Avaloses, the Lopezes and the Contrerases, including a feverish baby named Aaron, whose mother, Nataly, lowered his temperature with medicine and water-bottle baths by the roadside. Entire hometowns were grouped together, like the contingent from Siguatepeque, a mountain-ringed town in Honduras.\n\nWithout buses, it became clear that the journey would take much longer than they had hoped, and some mulled taking a different route. One young man said he was messaging a smuggler friend who told him it would cost $7,500 to cross the U.S. border.\n\nSome jumped in taxis. But many stayed, saying it was cheaper to travel together.\n\nAfter the 44-mile trip from Sayula to Isla, brothers Arnulfo and Arnoldo Gomez stopped at a gas station to take stock. They had no money. Their cellphones were dead. Arnoldo, at 30 six years older than his brother, wore plastic sandals because his boot soles had fallen off.\n\nArnoldo Gomez, who left a wife and two children in Tocoa, Honduras, said several women had offered to take him in. He refused to leave his brother and the friends he had made on the road.\n\n\u201cThese are the temptations,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe have to stay together,\u201d said Jose Guillen, 22, standing near his new friend Alejandro Carvajal, an 18-year-old singer. They were traveling with a group from San Pedro Sula.\n\nAt a stop between Isla and Cordoba, Orlando Rodas Martinez, a 22-year-old organizer with Pueblo Sin Fronteras, advised people against splitting up and hitching rides.\n\n\u201cCompa\u00f1eros, we can\u2019t skip ahead like this,\u201d he told a group. \u201cIf there are few of you, it\u2019s easier for the authorities to come and round you all up.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome say one thing, and others say something else,\u201d one man said, and took off.\n\nBy Saturday night, the remaining migrants packed Isla\u2019s cavernous social center and spilled onto the streets outside.\n\nInside the social center, usually reserved for weddings and dances, the caravan rearranged itself as a small village. Families and migrants slept blanket-to-blanket, on blowup mattresses and wooden pallets. Others pitched tents. Laundry was strung from poles.\n\nMaynor Chavez, a 44-year-old father from Copan, set up shop on a yellow tarp, selling shampoo, lollipops and cigarettes he had bought with money donated along the way.\n\nOn Venustiano Carranza Street, residents with houses still decorated for the Day of the Dead let migrants sleep on their patios or take showers. The air filled with the sounds of barking dogs and crying children.\n\nHours later, they were gone.\n\nRead more:\n\nWhy migrant families are seeking asylum at the border in record numbers\n\nHow to organize a 5,000-person migrant caravan\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "\n\nYeshiva High School students pray at a memorial in front of the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh on Oct. 29.(Salwan Georges/The Washington Post)\n\nFor days he was known only as \u201cThe Jewish Nurse,\u201d the person whose compassion captivated the world in the days after the mass shooting at Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh left 11 Jewish people dead.\n\nHe was the nurse who cared for Robert Bowers, the accused shooter, as Bowers reportedly yelled \u201cDeath to all Jews\u201d as he was wheeled into the emergency room at Allegheny General Hospital last month.\n\nNow The Jewish Nurse is no longer nameless. He is Ari Mahler, who came forward for the first time over the weekend to tell the story of Oct. 27 in a powerful social media post. The Facebook post, which has been shared more than 133,000 times as of early Monday, began, \u201cI am The Jewish Nurse.\" From there, it chronicled how Mahler found empathy for the suspected perpetrator of the deadliest attack on Jews in U.S. history at a time when the world fixated on his hatred.\n\n\u201cLove. That\u2019s why I did it,\u201d Mahler wrote in the Facebook post. \u201cLove as an action is more powerful than words, and love in the face of evil gives others hope. It demonstrates humanity. It reaffirms why we\u2019re all here. \u2026 I could care less what Robert Bowers thinks, but you, the person reading this, love is the only message I wish to instill in you.\u201d\n\nI am The Jewish Nurse. Yes, that Jewish Nurse. The same one that people are talking about in the Pittsburgh shooting... Posted by Ari Mahler on Saturday, November 3, 2018\n\nA spokesman for Allegheny General Hospital confirmed the authenticity of Mahler\u2019s claim and the Facebook post to The Washington Post. Mahler declined further comment.\n\nMahler\u2019s story first emerged when Allegheny General Hospital President Jeffrey Cohen, who is also Jewish and a member of Tree of Life synagogue, told multiple news outlets that a Jewish nurse and Jewish doctor were among the first to treat the suspected shooter. The 46-year-old Bowers, who has pleaded not guilty to 44 charges, including hate crimes, had suffered multiple gunshot wounds during a shootout with police.\n\nBefore Bowers arrived, Mahler had panicked: He worried his parents might be among the victims, he said. But later, as Bowers was wheeled into the emergency room, \u201cI didn\u2019t see evil when I looked into Bower\u2019s eyes,\u201d Mahler wrote. \u201cI saw something else.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can tell you that as his nurse, or anyone\u2019s nurse, my care is given through kindness,\u201d he wrote, \u201cmy actions are measured with empathy, and regardless of the person you may be when you\u2019re not in my care, each breath you take is more beautiful than the last when you\u2019re lying on my stretcher.\u201d He added that patient privacy laws limited how much he could say about his interactions with Bowers. \u201cThis was the same Robert Bowers that just committed mass homicide. The Robert Bowers who instilled panic in my heart worrying my parents were two of his 11 victims less than an hour before his arrival.\u201d\n\nMahler, the son of a rabbi, said in his post that the \u201cfact that this shooting took place doesn\u2019t shock me.\u201d\n\nHe cited statistics about hate crimes targeting Jewish people, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know why people hate us so much, but the underbelly of anti-Semitism seems to be thriving.\" The FBI found most recently in 2016 that Jews were victims of 54 percent of all anti-religious hate crimes, despite accounting for only about 2 percent of the U.S. population.\n\nMahler had experienced plenty of anti-Semitism as a kid, he wrote. He had found drawings left on desks showing his family being marched into gas chambers, swastikas drawn on his locker and notes left inside reading, \u201cDie Jew. Love, Hitler.\u201d And so when he emerged nameless in headlines suddenly as \u201cThe Jewish Nurse,\u201d all in stories that had celebrated his religious identity, the experience was almost foreign to him \u2014 \u201cawkward,\u201d he called it.\n\nI just want to say that I\u2019m truly in disbelief, but all the more grateful, for the outpouring of love and support. On... Posted by Ari Mahler on Sunday, November 4, 2018\n\n\u201cWhen I was a kid, being labeled \u2018The Jewish (anything),\u2019 undoubtedly had derogatory connotations attached to it. That\u2019s why it feels so awkward to me that people suddenly look at it as an endearing term,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAs an adult, deflecting my religion by saying \u2018I\u2019m not that religious,\u2019 makes it easier for people to accept I\u2019m Jewish \u2014 especially when I tell them my father is a rabbi. \u2018I\u2019m not that religious,\u2019 is like saying, \u2018Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not that Jewish, therefore I\u2019m not so different than you,\u2019 and like clockwork, people don\u2019t look at me as awkwardly as they did a few seconds beforehand.\u201d\n\nMahler made a choice as he treated Bowers\u2019s bullet wounds in the emergency room that day, he said. He didn\u2019t think Bowers knew he was Jewish, because Bowers had thanked him, and, \u201cwhy thank a Jewish nurse, when 15 minutes beforehand, you\u2019d shoot me in the head with no remorse?\u201d he wrote.\n\nHe decided he would not \u201csay a word to him about my religion.\u201d\n\n\u201cI chose not to say anything to him the entire time. I wanted him to feel compassion. I chose to show him empathy. I felt that the best way to honor his victims was for a Jew to prove him wrong. Besides, if he finds out I\u2019m Jewish, does it really matter? The better question is, what does it mean to you?\"\n\nMore from Morning Mix:\n\nIndian hunters track down and kill tiger linked to 13 deadly attacks, angering conservationists\n\nRihanna doesn\u2019t want Trump playing her music at his \u2018tragic rallies,' but she may not have a choice\n\nNovelist Stephen King has \u2018personal reasons\u2019 for wanting \u2018racist dumbbell\u2019 Steve King out of office", "SoftBank Group Corp.

The commission is investigating a pyramid scheme that cheated thousands of Poles out of their savings during Tusk\u2019s time as Poland\u2019s prime minister. (Alik Keplicz/Associated Press)\n\nWARSAW, Poland \u2014 Donald Tusk, the head of the European Council, strongly defended his actions as Poland\u2019s former prime minister during questioning Monday into a pyramid scheme that cheated thousands of Poles out of their savings.\n\nIn an emotional moment during the seven-hour hearing, which was televised live across Poland, Tusk told the ruling conservative party that it was using his questioning by a parliamentary committee for political purposes.\n\n\u201cYou need this commission, you need this spectacle, to keep repeating ... your insinuations, also on the subject of my family,\u201d Tusk said.\n\nStill, Tusk said during the questioning that he did not feel particularly threatened or the object of a witch hunt. He said he was confident in his actions as prime minister from 2007 to 2014.\n\nTusk said the hearing showed the weakness of the commission, which he said was trying to put blame on him.\n\nBefore the hearing, Tusk told reporters he rearranged his EU calendar and showed up because he treats the commission\u2019s work \u201cseriously.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was my obligation as a citizen,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, there was no escaping the political overtones of Monday\u2019s interrogation, for there have been years of enmity between Tusk and Poland\u2019s ruling Law and Justice party leader, Jaroslaw Kaczynski. Commentators on private TVN24 described the event as a public \u201cgrilling,\u201d and it was widely seen as part of the conservative party\u2019s efforts to discredit Tusk, a political foe who is still popular in Poland.\n\nTusk was sworn in by the special multi-party commission that has already questioned dozens of state officials in its efforts to pinpoint responsibility for the scam. Addressing him as \u201cprime minister\u201d the commission sought to determine the scope of Tusk\u2019s authority over state security and other offices and when he was made aware of the pyramid scheme by the Amber Gold financial institution.\n\nProsecutors say some 19,000 investors lost over 850 million zlotys ($225 million) in what turned out to be one of the biggest financial scandals in Poland. Amber Gold\u2019s two founders are both under arrest in prison and are on trial facing up to 15-year sentences. One of them is also serving a prison term for another bank scam.\n\nThe scam, which was revealed in 2012, has raised questions about the effectiveness of Poland\u2019s government during Tusk\u2019s term in office. Critics say Polish authorities failed to react in time to warning signals about Amber Gold.\n\nRejecting these allegations, Tusk said a warning against Amber Gold was issued by the Polish Financial Supervision Commission, or KNF, and it was not the prime minister\u2019s job to issue such a warning.\n\n\u201cWhile I have sympathy for those who invested in Amber Gold, because they are the victims of these dealings, I want to say that a warning by the KNF that it was linked to very high risk was publicly available,\u201d Tusk said.\n\nHe suggested that some anti-crime procedures had failed in the Amber Gold case, as well as fiscal controls and the office for protecting consumers.\n\n\u201cIn the Amber Gold case, had all the links described in the procedure worked as they should have, we would have probably managed to avoid the lion\u2019s share of the losses that people sustained,\u201d Tusk said.\n\nOne of the themes of the investigation and of Monday\u2019s questioning was the fact that Tusk\u2019s son Michal was employed by an airline owned by Amber Gold. Tusk denied allegations that his son\u2019s job could have served as a protective umbrella for the pyramid scheme.\n\nThe televised questioning came a day after Poland\u2019s populist ruling party suffered a blow in the country\u2019s mayoral races by failing to win control of any of the nation\u2019s largest cities.

Two buildings collapsed in the southern city of Marseille on Monday, leaving a giant pile of rubble and beams. Fire services said two people were lightly hurt. The collapse spewed debris into the street and clouds of dust into the air, and left a big gap where the two buildings used to be. (Claude Paris/Associated Press)\n\nMARSEILLE, France \u2014 Two buildings collapsed into a pile of rubble and beams Monday in the French city of Marseille, where authorities spoke of a race against time to find people possibly trapped in the ruins.\n\nThe buildings \u2014 one condemned and supposedly vacant, the other containing apartments \u2014 gave way after 9 a.m. In the spot where they had stood, a large gap appeared once the dust and debris settled.\n\nMarseille fire services said two people who were in the street when the buildings collapsed were treated for light injuries. French President Emmanuel Macron said Monday evening it was unknown if anyone was killed or trapped.\n\nFire officials deliberately brought down most of a third building due to concerns the unstable structure might cave on top of search crews and sniffer dogs combing the rubble of the other buildings. The late afternoon demolition released more dust clouds.\n\nAuthorities said one building had been condemned as substandard and was assumed to be unoccupied, but the other was inhabited. The government\u2019s housing minister, Julien Denormandie, said at the scene he couldn\u2019t rule out that people were trapped in the collapse.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a race against the clock,\u201d Denormandie said. \u201cThe urgent task is to determine whether there are people we can save.\u201d\n\nThick dust covered cars around the site near Marseille\u2019s famous Old Port.

Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. (Jacquelyn Martin/AP)\n\nWill Brett M. Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation to the Supreme Court affect the midterms?\n\nFor three weeks this fall, the Kavanaugh confirmation process dominated the country\u2019s public attention. We analyzed U.S. social media discussion of the Kavanaugh hearings during this time and found that it dwarfed other topics. That was particularly true in states, such as Maine, whose senators were considered swing votes. While language used in tweets about Kavanaugh was less profane on average than social media in general, it was also disturbingly gendered, especially when directed at female senators.\n\nHow we did our research\n\nTo assess the social media response to the Kavanaugh hearing and confirmation, we collected every geocoded tweet sent in the United States from Sept. 14, the day Ronan Farrow and Jane Mayer at The New Yorker first reported an allegation of sexual assault, through Oct. 6, the day he was confirmed. Geocoded tweets are tweets that have latitude and longitude coordinates attached by a GPS-enabled device such as a smartphone. Over that three-week period, we collected 31.5 million U.S. geocoded tweets.\n\nIn addition, we collected every tweet \u2014 geocoded or not \u2014 that mentioned the word \u201cKavanaugh\u201d during this period, for an additional 24.4 million tweets. These are useful for establishing whether the geocoded tweets are roughly representative of the overall social media environment. In general, we found that the non-geocoded tweets were roughly comparable, with similar proportions of individuals talking about Kavanaugh, tweeting at their senators and using profane language.\n\nWhile geocoded tweets only represent about 2 percent of all tweets, they are useful for establishing comparative geographic patterns between states, because the ways in which geocoded tweets are nonrepresentative should not be different from state to state. By comparing geocoded tweets from one state to those from another state, we can draw conclusions about how relatively different the general conversation on Twitter is in those states.\n\nThe intensity of the Kavanaugh debate\n\nWithin the geocoded data, we searched each tweet for the word \u201cKavanaugh,\u201d including hashtags, to measure the proportion of U.S. twitter activity related to his confirmation process. The results reveal this nomination received a staggering level of attention from Americans. While active U.S. Twitter users are on average younger, wealthier and more educated, they still make up nearly a quarter of the American population, and the bulk of trending conversation tends toward popular culture. However, over this three-week period, 1 in every 79 geocoded tweets in the United States mentioned Kavanaugh by name. On Sept. 27, the day of the Judiciary hearing, the proportion increased to 1 in 22.\n\nThis proportion of tweets overshadows every other topic, political or not, during this time. For instance, only 1 in 6,100 tweets mentioned \u201cNAFTA\u201d on Oct. 1, the date on which the administration announced it reached an agreement with Canada and Mexico. Over these three weeks, the National Football League was mentioned in only 1 in 183 tweets, less than half the rate of Kavanaugh.\n\nWhile the Kavanaugh nomination dominated discourse, its intensity varied by state. In the figure below, we show the percentage of tweets each day that mentioned Kavanaugh from Sept. 14 through his confirmation, highlighting four critical states. Mainers\u2019 interest in the critical role of Sen. Susan Collins (R) shows how they consistently tweeted about Kavanaugh at a higher rate than other Americans. On the date of the Judiciary Committee hearing, over 7 percent of all geocoded tweets in Maine mentioned Kavanaugh.\n\n\n\nProportion of tweets mentioning Kavanaugh by name\n\nData: Twitter; Figure: Jeremy Gelman\n\nThe map below shows the regional concentration of this intensity. The map renders the proportion of tweets discussing Kavanaugh in each state on Sept. 27. Darker green indicates higher proportions.\n\n\n\nProportion of tweets from each state mentioning Kavanaugh\n\nData: Twitter; Figure: Steven Wilson\n\nProfanity and pressure on senators\n\nTo examine the kinds of conversations Americans were having about the confirmation, we ran all the Kavanaugh-specific tweets through a model that assesses the dominant dimension of conversation. We expected the main dimension to be partisan or ideological language.\n\nWe were wrong. What distinguished how people wrote about the Kavanaugh nomination was where they fell on the anger scale. On one end of the spectrum, people tweeted angrily, using hashtags, slurs and pejoratives. For instance, the anger in the language of those using the #stopKavanaugh hashtag was statistically almost identical to that of the #confirmKavanaugh hashtag. Those at the other end of the anger spectrum wrote in full sentences, expressing opinions or trying to reason with commenters.\n\nTo characterize tweeters\u2019 level of anger, we searched our Twitter database for uses of any profanity in George Carlin\u2019s once-famous list of \u201cSeven Words You Can Never Say on Television\u201d and cross-referenced that with our other data. By this measure, 5 percent of all U.S.-based tweets are profane; only 3.5 percent of tweets that mentioned Kavanaugh were; and only 2.1 percent of tweets directed at senators about Kavanaugh were.\n\nHowever, Carlin\u2019s list includes both gendered (terms specifically targeting women) and non-gendered profanity \u2014 and so misses just how gendered this anger was. While 17.5 percent of all profane tweets use gendered profanity, 30 percent of those directed at Collins were gendered. However, most of those were from out of state; only 16 percent of those originating within her home state of Maine were.\n\nWhile several prominent events have dominated headlines since those hearings, both Democrats and Republicans have claimed the Kavanaugh hearings roused their voters and motivated them to vote this Tuesday in the midterm elections. While we don\u2019t yet know how it might affect election results, anger certainly permeated both sides of this partisan fight. Political scientists often worry that when one side of the political spectrum is not speaking to the other side, that side will only hear from like-minded partisans \u2014 while the public at large is not paying attention.\n\nThe Kavanaugh nomination defied these trends, rousing sustained public attention throughout the country. Many Americans were willing to engage in public debate and to contact their senators about this topic. While the scale of the public\u2019s attention was staggering, and troublingly gendered anger emerged, what may be especially surprising is that the conversation about Kavanaugh was actually less profane than the average social media conversation in America.\n\nRead more:\n\nJeremy Gelman is assistant professor of political science at the University of Nevada at Reno.\n\nSteven Wilson is assistant professor of political science at the University of Nevada at Reno and a project manager for the Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) Institute.", "Sri Lankan president Maithripala Sirisena, right, and his newly appointed prime minister Mahinda Rajapaksa wave to supporters during a rally held out side the parliamentary complex in Colombo, Sri Lanka, Monday, Nov. 5, 2018.

Thousands of his supporters have been keeping vigil.\n\nSupporters of Rajapaksa at the rally chanted \u201cWhose power is this? Mahinda\u2019s power!\u201d\n\nAs patriotic songs blared over loudspeakers, thousands shuffled through heavy rain toward a makeshift stage. Police and Sri Lankan special forces with semi-automatic rifles stood guard.\n\nPolice estimated 120,000 people attended the rally. State television reported there were at least 200,000.\n\nPradeep Kariyawasam, the head of Rajapaksa\u2019s party in Colombo, said that although Wickremesinghe continues to maintain he is the country\u2019s legitimate leader, \u201cthe people are with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cGive people a chance to choose their government and not hide behind constitutional interpretations,\u201d he said.\n\nSirisena and Rajapaksa arrived at the rally amid loud cheers.\n\nSirisena told the crowd that the change he initiated was more than a personnel shift.\n\n\u201cI ousted a vision that is incompatible with our local culture and values, and that works according to foreign agendas,\u201d Sirisena said.\n\n\u201cFor the past 3 \u00bd years, poor people were suppressed by Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2019s economic and political vision. Local thoughts were rejected and an extreme neo-liberal form of governance was carried out.\u201d\n\nHe was referring to Wickremesinghe\u2019s free-market economic policies and public-private partnerships with companies from China and India to operate strategic centers such as ports and airports.\n\nRajapaksa supporters have accused Wickremesinghe of selling Sri Lanka\u2019s assets, citing a 99-year lease agreement his government struck with Hong Kong conglomerate China Merchants Port Holdings Co. Ltd. last year to operate a failing port developed with Chinese debt during Rajapaksa\u2019s decadelong presidency.\n\n\u201cForeign countries are trying to take our resources, take our land,\u201d said Mithra Kumara Jayasinghe, a wedding photographer at the rally who said he had voted for Rajapaksa the two times he was elected president, in 2005 and 2010, and when he lost a re-election bid in 2015.\n\nCritics of Sirisena\u2019s actions say Parliament was suspended to give Rajapaksa time to gather enough support to survive a no-confidence vote when lawmakers reconvene Nov. 14.\n\nParliament Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said on Monday that he won\u2019t recognize the new appointments until either side is able to prove it has a majority. It means that the speaker still recognizes a Wickremesinghe-led Parliament.\n\n\u201cI wish to emphasize that I am compelled to accept the status that existed previously until such time that they (the pro-Wickremesinghe lawmakers) and the new political alliance prove their majority in Parliament,\u201d he said.\n\nThe statement was fuel at Rajapaksa\u2019s five-hour rally. Lawmaker Susil Premjayantha told the crowd that electing a new speaker could be the first order of business when Parliament reopens, suggesting the party will bring a no-confidence motion against Jayasuriya.\n\nWickremesinghe said in an interview with The Associated Press last week that there is credible evidence that Rajapaksa\u2019s party is attempting to buy support in Parliament. Palitha Range Bandara, a United National Party lawmaker, has said that he was offered millions of dollars and a minister portfolio if he crossed over.\n\nLawmakers from Rajapaksa\u2019s party have denied the allegations.\n\nSeven members of Wickremesinghe\u2019s United National Front have defected to Rajapaksa\u2019s government.\n\nOn Saturday, the Tamil National Alliance \u2014 an ethnic minority Tamil party \u2014 said it will support a no-confidence motion to be brought against Rajapaksa, after one lawmaker from their party joined Rajapaksa\u2019s government.\n\nThe Tamil party\u2019s 15 votes could give Wickremesinghe\u2019s camp a decisive edge over Rajapaksa.\n\nBoth Sirisena and Rajapaksa attempted to woo Tamil lawmakers in their speeches at the rally.\n\nSpeaking in the Tamil language, Rajapaksa promised to fulfill the Tamil people\u2019s needs.\n\n\u201cWhat I ask from all Tamil and (Tamil-speaking) Muslim people and their political parties is to help to build up our country. I trust you and you can always trust me,\u201d Rajapaksa said.\n\nEthnic minority Tamils in the country\u2019s north and east are still reeling from the effects of a 26-year civil war between Tamil Tiger separatists and government troops.\n\nRajapaksa is seen as a hero by the ethnic Sinhalese majority for winning the conflict.\n\nTens of thousands of civilians were reportedly killed in the final months of the war in 2009, when government troops brutally crushed the rebels. Thousands more are still missing.\n\nSirisena came into power in 2015 promising to address the issues affecting the Tamils and investigate allegations of war crimes against both sides of the conflict, but has done little in either area. He was also critical of investigations into military personnel accused of human rights violations during the civil war.\n\nAmong the crowd Monday was Basil Ros, 58, a fisherman from the village of Negombo.\n\nRos said a local lawmaker from Rajapaksa\u2019s United People\u2019s Freedom Alliance bused him and his wife in with many others, pledging to give them 1,000 rupees (about $5.80), food and alcohol.\n\nHe said he hadn\u2019t received any money yet.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t trust politicians,\u201d he said. \u201cThey might pay; they might not.\u201d\n\nAfter sacking Wickremesinghe, Sirisena announced that he made the replacement in part because Wickremesinghe and a Cabinet colleague were behind an alleged assassination plot against him.\n\nDetails of the alleged plot have not been disclosed and Wickremesinghe has repeatedly denied the accusation.\n\nTensions had been building between Sirisena and Wickremesinghe for some time, as the president did not approve of economic reforms introduced by the prime minister.\n\nSirisena said at the rally that he would not be discouraged by resistance in Parliament, civil society and the international community to his actions.\n\n\u201cEven if there are threats, pressure and forces, I will only move forward and will not take a step back,\u201d he said.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

But in opening a high-profile import expo in Shanghai he offered no response to U.S. and European complaints about technology policy and curbs on foreign business.\n\nThe China International Import Expo is part of official efforts to defuse trade tension while resisting pressure to roll back industry plans that Washington, Europe, Japan and other governments say violate its market-opening obligations.\n\n\u201cIt is our sincere commitment to open the Chinese market,\u201d Xi said in a speech to a VIP audience that included Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev. Xi promised to \u201cstimulate the potential to increase imports,\u201d including by cutting costs for importers and improving consumer spending power.\n\nSome 3,600 companies from 152 countries selling everything from Egyptian dates to German factory machinery are attending the five-day event at a Shanghai convention center that bills itself as one of the world\u2019s biggest buildings.\n\nBusiness groups complain that while Beijing is expanding imports to serve its manufacturers and consumers, it blocks access to industries including finance and logistics.

But none addresses U.S. complaints that prompted Trump to impose penalty tariffs of up to 25 percent on $250 billion of Chinese imports. Beijing has responded with tariff hikes on $110 billion of American goods.\n\nChinese leaders have rejected pressure to roll back plans such as \u201cMade in China 2025,\u201d which calls for state-led creation of global champions in robotics and other fields.\n\nLast week, Trump and Xi had what China\u2019s foreign ministry called an \u201cextremely positive\u201d phone conversation.

Looking ahead, China will be here to stay.\u201d\n\nIn his address in Shanghai, closely watched as perhaps the Chinese president\u2019s last major speech on trade before he is set to meet with President Trump for crucial talks this month in Argentina, a confident Xi gave few signs that he was in the mood to make significant concessions.\n\nFor more than half an hour, Xi hit placating notes \u2014 and then steely ones. He made promises to cut tariffs, open up sectors such as health care and education to foreign investment, and import $45 trillion in goods and services over the next 15 years. Then he threw veiled jabs at Trump\u2019s leadership style.\n\n\u201cAs globalization deepens, the practices of law of the jungle and winner take all are a dead end,\u201d he said.\n\nHis remarks kicked off the China International Import Expo, a week-long showcase meant to rebrand China as a consumption powerhouse at a time when its record-high trade surplus with the United States is just one of many sticking points for the Trump administration, which has demanded that Beijing take concrete action to level the trade relationship and resolve the tariff standoff.\n\nWithout mentioning the United States by name, Xi made broad promises to let global companies tap into the Chinese middle class and \u201cshare the benefits of globalization.\u201d\n\n\u201cChina is a big market of over 1.3 billion people, and it is our sincere commitment to open the market,\u201d Xi said. \u201cChina increasing imports will not be a choice of political expediency but a future-oriented step taken to embrace the world.\u201d\n\nBut beyond the promises of boosting Chinese consumption, which has been a long-standing priority for Beijing, Xi stopped short of tackling the politically thorny complaints voiced by major trading partners.\n\n[Trump and China\u2019s Xi to meet in bid to end trade war tensions]\n\nFor instance, the United States, Europe and Japan have taken issue with aspects of China\u2019s industrial policy that prop up its domestic industries while blocking foreign firms, such as high-tech and Internet companies, in its bid for self-reliance. And many foreign governments have professed frustration with the alleged theft of trade secrets. The U.S. Department of Justice said last week it would launch an initiative to name and shame Chinese spies.\n\nXi acknowledged that China should strengthen intellectual property enforcement and said it would ratchet up punishments for violators. But he immediately followed up with a stiff rebuke of China\u2019s critics.\n\nThose who complain about Chinese commercial practices \u201cshould not just point fingers at others to gloss over their own problems,\u201d he said. \u201cThey should not hold a flashlight that only exposes others while doing nothing themselves.\u201d\n\nJim McGregor, chairman of the consultancy APCO\u2019s Greater China practice, said the foreign business community has \u201cheard these same things\u201d for years from Chinese leaders.\n\n\u201cPresident Xi said nice words about free trade, openness, intellectual property protection and China\u2019s willingness to be open to the world,\u201d McGregor said. \u201cBut all of this will fall on deaf ears unless concrete actions begin to take place.\u201d\n\nWith the United States notably absent, Xi ticked off a list of trade relationships that China has advanced: with the European Union, South Korea, Japan and African countries. China, he added, was fully committed to multinational organizations such as the Group of 20 and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation group.\n\nAt times, Xi appeared to also address his domestic audience. With China this winter approaching the 40th anniversary of the introduction of the \u201cReform and Opening Up\u201d movement launched by Deng Xiaoping, some intellectuals and political elites have wondered whether his administration has rolled back some of those \u00admarket-oriented reforms while assuming a bigger role in the private sector.\n\nThe path of reform and opening up was precisely what launched China to success, Xi said, adding that he was confident China\u2019s development would continue steadily despite its slowest GDP growth rate in a decade.\n\nWhile acknowledging factors \u201cat home and abroad\u201d that have affected the Chinese economy, Xi said that \u201cthe Chinese people will overcome all challenges coming our way.\u201d\n\nMore than 3,600 companies, including representatives from U.S. giants such as General Electric and Ford, attended the conference, according to Chinese state media.\n\nWhile the British trade minister was present, the event did not draw many top leaders from large countries aside from Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev. The U.S. government said it had no plans for \u201chigh-level participation\u201d in the Shanghai expo.\n\n\u201cWe encourage China to level the playing field for U.S. goods and services,\u201d the U.S. Embassy in Beijing said in a statement. \u201cChina needs to make the necessary reforms to end its unfair trade practices that are harming the world economy.\u201d\n\nStill, China rolled out the red carpet for allies old and new. After Xi spoke Monday morning, he yielded the stage to President Danilo Medina of the Dominican Republic, which this summer cut ties with Taiwan and established relations with Beijing \u2014 a move that infuriated the State Department.\n\nHours later, Imran Khan, the recently elected prime minister of Pakistan \u2014 China\u2019s closest ally \u2014 walked onstage and launched more veiled barbs at Washington.\n\n\u201cWhile unilateral commercialism is aggressively sought by some and protectionism is on the rise,\u201d Khan said, \u201cPakistan takes great comfort in President Xi\u2019s courageous statement that their doors will never shut.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nChina\u2019s Xi promotes self-reliance as next economic era\n\nWhite House downplays China on trade, sinking markets\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "YANGON, Myanmar \u2014 Lawyers for two Reuters journalists imprisoned in Myanmar have appealed the verdict that sent them to prison for seven years for illegal possession of official documents.\n\nWa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo had been reporting on the brutal crackdown on the Muslim Rohingya minority when they were arrested and charged with violating Myanmar\u2019s colonial-era Official Secrets Act.

It\u2019s been like learning to walk with your shoes tied together.\n\nThe $1,000 tablet was powerful enough to let me write, edit photos and publish this column with little more than my finger, a stylus and a keyboard case. But I also never figured out an efficient way to multitask, sit with decent posture and work for hours, or keep it balanced on my lap.\n\nFiling expense reports with my finger frustrated me to the point I wrote a sonnet to my missing mouse. How do I love thee? Let me count the ways. How your speed and precision fill my days.\n\n[iPhone XR Review: The best $250 you ever saved on a new phone]\n\nThe new iPad Pro, arriving in stores on Wednesday in two configurations \u2014 $800 for the 11-inch and $1,000 for the 12.9 inch \u2014 is the biggest design change and price hike ever to Apple\u2019s tablet. It might be great for artists or people who have to work mostly standing up. A substitute for a work laptop, though, it is not.\n\n\n\nThe new iPad Pro gets rid of the the home button and beefs up its processing speed. (Photo by John Brecher for The Washington Post)\n\nIronically, iPads now outsell Macs and every other laptop on the market. But that doesn\u2019t mean people are creating with them. iPads are great for watching video, playing games and reading. For that, you can spend a third as much as a big Pro on a regular $330 9.7-inch iPad, which got a speed boost and Apple Pencil stylus support this spring, though not an Apple-made keyboard case.\n\nYet Apple, eager for us to spend on pricier upgrades, is doubling down on the idea that the iPad is good for a lot more than consuming. The iPad Pro is its answer to Microsoft, which began to blend touch screens into full-powered Windows PCs and Surface devices back in 2012.\n\nApple isn\u2019t wrong to call the iPad the future. Ask any two-year-old who already knows how to use one. It just has to figure out finger-first experience for a generation raised on doing work with a mouse and trackpad.\n\n\n\nThe new Apple Pencil stylus clips with magnets to one edge of the iPad Pro. (Photo by John Brecher for The Washington Post)\n\nMore powerful than most laptops\n\nThe changes to the new iPad Pro attempt to narrow the gap with laptops by focusing on portability and power.\n\nThe home button and fingerprint reader have been replaced with the finger-swipe gestures and FaceID scanner now standard on the newest iPhones. It\u2019s mostly convenient, except when the iPad is sitting on a table and can\u2019t find your face, which happens more often than with a phone.\n\nThe reason you might want this change is that Apple filled the space where the button and cameras used to be with more glorious screen, so you end up holding less total volume. The original iPad Pro with a 12.9-inch screen was about as tall as a box of cereal, while the new version is closer to a standard sheet of paper.\n\n\n\nThe iPad Pro uses FaceID cameras hidden in the edge of the screen instead of a fingerprint reader. (Photo by John Brecher for The Washington Post)\n\nAt 1.4 pounds, the larger iPad Pro weighs a pound less than the new MacBook Air, and has a battery that lasts almost as long.\n\nThe $130 Apple Pencil stylus, available since the original, also joined in the makeover. An artist friend, who drew me a quick illustration on the new Pro with an app called Procreate, raved about its increased responsiveness. The bigger news for me is that the Pencil magnetically snaps to one side of the squared-off iPad Pro edge for storage and charging, giving me more of a fighting chance to not lose it.\n\nInside the new iPad, there\u2019s also a new A12X chip Apple says is more powerful than 92 percent of laptops available on the market. It was robust enough to handle any processing task I sent its way, including editing and sorting through thousands of photos in Adobe\u2019s Lightroom. (Next year, Adobe says it will bring to the iPad Pro a full-fledged version of its Photoshop app, too.)\n\nA new kind of port on the iPad Pro can also drive a second screen. I plugged it into my office monitor just like I do my laptop. That idea intrigued me: What if the iPad Pro had become powerful enough to be a transformer? Imagine if you could use it with fingers on the go, then get to the office and plug it into a docking station and it became a MacOS device working with big screen, keyboard and (yes!) a mouse?\n\nNope. Even driving an external monitor, the iPad Pro remains an iOS device you have to control with fingers (or Pencil) on the iPad, and run with apps designed only for iOS. The full PC transformer is actually the idea with Microsoft\u2019s Surface Pro, sold for $800 and up, which flips between touch screen and traditional desktop mode, and works with a trackpad or mouse. Apple\u2019s iPad Pro is unapologetically a finger and stylus-only machine.\n\n\n\nThe new iPad Pro works with a new Apple Pencil stylus that artists may find more responsive. (Photo by John Brecher for The Washington Post)\n\nThe finger-first experience\n\nJust because the iPad Pro is as fast as a laptop doesn\u2019t make it as useful as one.\n\nSitting inside its serviceable keyboard case, which props up the screen like a laptop, the iPad Pro can balance on a table. But on my lap it feels top-weighted, so my hands on the keyboard have to be a counterbalance. (The Surface Pro has a kickstand in the back that helps keep it from falling.)\n\n\n\nThe new iPad Pro uses the USB-C style port for charging and plugging in external devices such as a monitor.

Since you need to touch the screen to swipe through apps or select things, I couldn\u2019t quite figure out how to sit with the iPad. Hunched over? What about while writing, where the screen is propped up in that case but you still need to reach up to do things? Apple has in the past criticized other tech for causing \u201cgorilla arm syndrome\u201d with vertical touch screens, but it\u2019s done little new to address the problem here.\n\nThe iPad Pro\u2019s biggest problem is its software. In iOS 12, the iPad has some ability to make between two and four apps share the screen simultaneously, but not all apps play ball. For example, you can\u2019t make Spotify split the screen with Google Docs or Microsoft Word. Getting apps into these sharing modes also requires finger yoga that\u2019s a lot more work than moving around windows with a mouse.\n\nWhile iOS 12 has a few keyboard shortcuts that help zip between apps, what I was missing was a degree of information density. Everyone has a different way of working, but sometimes on a Mac I\u2019ll have five windows open at once, passively monitoring messages, email, Slack, Twitter and music. On the iPad, I had to keep flipping through apps in an attempt to stay tuned in. Some iPad apps don\u2019t even show you the time and battery level along the top edge.\n\n(One unexpected benefit: it\u2019s probably easier to concentrate on a single task like writing on the iPad.)\n\n\n\nNot quite a laptop, not quite a lean-back tablet, how are you supposed to sit with an iPad Pro and do work? (Photo by John Brecher for The Washington Post)\n\nMost of the best examples of professional finger and stylus-first are apps for artists who benefit the most from working on top of a screen. Too many other iPad apps are still compromises designed for very light work. There are a million little things missing: For example, the iPad app I used to make the GIF in this article \u2014 the best of a half dozen I tried \u2014 didn\u2019t give me control over the size of the final product, a critical factor for publishing that my MacOS GIF maker offers.\n\nAnd there are still lots of workplace software and websites that presume you\u2019re using a mouse or trackpad for precision pointing and selecting. It\u2019s especially true of spreadsheet or data-entry apps. My employer\u2019s expense system is one.\n\nIt\u2019s ultimately about ergonomics. I called Jack Dennerlein, a professor at Northeastern University who studies the way our bodies interface with tech. \u201cBefore the mouse and desktop computing there was a pen or pencil and paper,\u201d he reminded me. My affection for the mouse and trackpad is misplaced, he said: we put them between us and what happens on a computer screen out of technological necessity. It\u2019s actually pretty unnatural \u2014 just trying signing your name with one.\n\nWhen Apple first popularized the mouse in the 80s, people complained it required so much wrist motion. When the iPhone first arrived, people complained it lacked a physical keyboard.\n\nI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll look back on the iPad Pro in the same way, but it still has some evolving to do. Until then, bring back my mouse.\n\nRead more tech advice and analysis from Geoffrey A.

Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent, would be a fundamental change, expanding Medicare to cover almost everyone in the country. But current Medicare recipients would get improved benefits. Sanders would eliminate Medicare deductibles, limit copays, and provide coverage for dental and vision care, as well as hearing aids. A House single-payer bill calls for covering long-term care.\n\nThe issue is whether the U.S. can afford to convert to a new government-run health care system, not that older Americans would be left uncovered. The Democratic proposals call for new taxes to help pay for expanded Medicare coverage.\n\n___\n\nVETERANS\n\nTRUMP: \u201cWhat we\u2019ve done for the military and the vets \u2014 we\u2019ve gotten them Choice, where they can now go to a doctor and the United States pays for it instead of waiting in line for two months and three months and not being able to see a doctor, and literally dying \u2014 dying while they were waiting on line to see a doctor. After 44 years they\u2019ve been working on it, I got it approved. And that\u2019s Choice for veterans.\u201d \u2014 remarks Friday to reporters.\n\nTHE FACTS: No, he is not the first president in 44 years to get passed in Congress a private-sector health program for veterans. More broadly, he exaggerates VA improvements under his watch by suggesting the newly expanded program will have immediate effect.\n\nCongress first approved the Veterans Choice program in 2014 during the Obama administration in the wake of a scandal at the Phoenix VA medical center in which some veterans died while waiting months for appointments. The program allows veterans to see doctors outside the VA system if they must wait more than 30 days for an appointment or drive more than 40 miles to a VA facility.\n\nTrump signed legislation in June to expand the Choice program by giving veterans even wider access to private-sector doctors at government expense, subject to yet-to-be-completed rules that will determine eligibility as well as available money. The VA has yet to resolve long-term financing due to congressional budget caps that could put funding for VA or other domestic programs at risk next year.\n\nKey to the program\u2019s success is an overhaul of the VA\u2019s electronic medical records to allow seamless sharing of medical records with private physicians, expected to take up to 10 years. VA Secretary Robert Wilkie has said the program\u2019s implementation is \u201cyears\u201d away.\n\n___\n\nMEDIAN INCOME\n\nTRUMP, on attracting the nonwhite vote from Democrats: \u201cWe have the best unemployment numbers, the best median income numbers for all of these groups. We have the best numbers we\u2019ve ever had. ...They should be worried about the African-Americans, because they\u2019re going to lose them.\u201d \u2014 Fox interview on Oct. 29\n\nTHE FACTS: He did not achieve the best median income numbers for all the nonwhite groups. Both African-Americans and Asian-Americans had higher income prior to the Trump administration.\n\nThe median income last year for a black household was $40,258, according to the Census Bureau. That\u2019s below a 2000 peak of $42,348 and also statistically no better than 2016, President Barack Obama\u2019s last year in office.\n\nMany economists view the continued economic growth since the middle of 2009, in Obama\u2019s first term, as the primary explanation for recent hiring and income gains. More important, there are multiple signs that the racial wealth gap is now worsening even as unemployment rates have come down.\n\nAs to Asian-Americans, the median income for a typical household last year was $81,331. It was $83,182 in 2016.\n\n___\n\nILLEGAL IMMIGRATION\n\nTRUMP, on Montana Democratic Sen. Jon Tester: \u201cTester joined every other Senate Democrat in supporting open-border legislation from the now-legendary Dianne Feinstein.\u201d \u2014 Montana rally Saturday.\n\nTHE FACTS: He\u2019s misrepresenting a bill that does not direct borders to be more porous than now.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California is sponsoring a bill that has the support of every Democratic senator including Tester. The bill\u2019s aim is to stop the Trump administration\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy of criminally prosecuting all adults caught crossing the border illegally and putting their children under Department of Health and Human Services custody and care.\n\nThe bill seeks to limit family separations by barring federal agents and officers from removing a child from a parent within 100 miles of U.S. borders. Exceptions would apply in cases where a child is danger of trafficking or abuse or neglect, or when there is a strong likelihood the adult is not the parent.\n\nWhile Trump asserts that the bill would spur \u201copen borders\u201d and change immigration law, nothing in the legislation would prohibit the removal or detention of immigrants who arrive in the U.S. illegally if the families are kept together.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP, on the practice of allowing immigrants caught crossing the border illegally to stay in U.S. communities as they await immigration hearings: \u201cWe\u2019re not doing releases. What\u2019s been happening over years is they would come in, release them, and they would never show up for their trial. And we now have 25 or 30 million people in this country illegally, because of what\u2019s been happening over many years.\u201d \u2014 remarks Wednesday to reporters.\n\nTHE FACTS: It\u2019s nowhere close to 25 million to 30 million, nor has the number increased much in recent years.\n\nThe nonpartisan Pew Research Center estimates there were 11.3 million immigrants in the U.S. illegally in 2016, the most recent data available. That number is basically unchanged from 2009. Advocacy groups on both sides of the immigration issue have similar estimates.\n\nThe number of such immigrants had reached a height of 12.2 million in 2007, representing about 4 percent of the U.S. population, before declining due in part to a weakening U.S. economy.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP, on tweeting a video blaming Democrats allowing a man to enter the U.S. who killed two police officers: \u201cAll I\u2019m doing is just telling the truth.\u201d \u2014 speaking to reporters Friday.\n\nTHE FACTS: The video he spread around does not tell the truth. It says Democrats let Luis Bracamontes into the country and \u201clet him stay.\u201d\n\nBracamontes entered the U.S. illegally, in 1996, during the Democratic administration of President Bill Clinton, but he was also deported by that administration the next year after being caught buying crack cocaine and serving his sentence. He returned repeatedly. By the time he was sentenced to death in California for the 2014 killings of the police officers, he had been deported four times, according to Sacramento County Sheriff Scott Jones.\n\nNo evidence of leniency by Democrats has emerged in the episode. Democratic and Republican administrations alike have deported hundreds of thousands of people a year and no administration, Trump\u2019s included, has caught everyone trying to enter illegally.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP on what U.S. troops should do if encountering migrants who are trying to get to the border from Mexico: \u201cI didn\u2019t say shoot, I didn\u2019t say shoot.\u201d \u2014 remarks to reporters Friday.\n\nTHE FACTS: A day earlier, he said of the migrants: \u201cThey want to throw rocks at our military, our military fights back. I told them, consider it a rifle.\u201d\n\nThe procession has been largely peaceful. Some migrants in one caravan clashed with Mexican police at the Mexico-Guatemala border, hurling stones.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP: \u201cPresident Obama separated the children from parents and nobody complained. When we continued the exact same law, the country went crazy.\u201d \u2014 immigration speech Thursday.\n\nTHE FACTS: Actually, Obama did not do the same thing as a matter of policy.\n\nWhile it\u2019s true the underlying laws were the same, the Trump administration mandated anyone caught crossing the border illegally was to be criminally prosecuted. That policy meant adults were taken to court for criminal proceedings, and their children were separated and sent into the care of the Health and Human Services Department, which is tasked with caring for unaccompanied migrant children. Trump\u2019s zero tolerance policy remains in effect, but he signed an executive order June 20 that stopped separations.\n\nJeh Johnson, Obama\u2019s Homeland Security secretary, recently told NPR there may have been unusual or emergency circumstances when children were taken from parents, but there was no such policy.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP: \u201cAt this very moment, large well-organized caravans of migrants are marching towards our southern border. Some people call it an invasion. ...These are tough people in many cases; a lot of young men, strong men and a lot of men that maybe we don\u2019t want in our country. ...This isn\u2019t an innocent group of people. It\u2019s a large number of people that are tough. They have injured, they have attacked.\u201d \u2014 immigration speech Thursday.\n\nTHE FACTS: He\u2019s given no evidence that people in the caravans are, by and large, dangerous, hardened criminals \u2014 after acknowledging at one point that there is no such proof.\n\nThe migrants in the caravans are mostly from Honduras, where it started, as well as El Salvador and Guatemala. Overall, they are poor, carrying the belongings that fit into a knapsack and fleeing gang violence or poverty.\n\nIt might be true there are some criminals mixed in with the throngs, given the sheer number of migrants. Trump did not substantiate his claim that members of the MS-13 gang, in particular, are among them. The Homeland Security Department issued a sheet stating that \u201cover 270 individuals along the caravan route have criminal histories, including known gang membership.\u201d But it did not specify how it had arrived at that number.\n\nSome migrants in one of the caravans clashed with Mexican police at the Mexico-Guatemala border, hurling stones and other objects as they tried to cross the international bridge. One migrant died; it\u2019s not clear how it happened. Caravan leaders said they had expelled a number of troublemakers from the procession, exhibiting some self-policing. Ultimately, most entered Guatemala \u2014 and later, Mexico \u2014 by illegally bypassing immigration checkpoints.\n\nThe caravan otherwise has been overwhelmingly peaceful, receiving applause and donated food from residents of the towns they pass. Mexican police have not tried again to stop them.\n\n___\n\nBIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP\n\nTRUMP: \u201cIt was always told to me that you needed a constitutional amendment. Guess what? You don\u2019t. ... Well, you can definitely do it with an act of Congress. But now they\u2019re saying I can do it just with an executive order.\u201d \u2014 interview published Tuesday with \u201cAxios on HBO.\u201d\n\nTHE FACTS: Scholars widely pan the idea that Trump could unilaterally change the rules on who is a citizen. It\u2019s highly questionable whether an act of Congress could do it, either, though it is conceivable that legislators could change the rules regarding children born in the U.S. of parents who are in the country illegally.\n\nPeter Schuck is perhaps the most prominent advocate of the idea that birthright citizenship is not conveyed by the Constitution to children of parents who are living illegally in the U.S. Even he says \u201cTrump clearly cannot act by\u201d executive order.\n\n\u201cI feel confident that no competent lawyer would advise him otherwise,\u201d he said by email Tuesday. \u201cThis is just pre-election politics and misrepresentation and should be sharply criticized as such.\u201d\n\nSchuck, of Yale, and colleague Rogers Smith of the University of Pennsylvania have argued since the mid-1980s that Congress can set the rules for providing citizenship to U.S.-born children of parents who came illegally.\n\nBut most scholars on the left and right share the view that it would take a constitutional amendment to deny automatic citizenship to children born in the U.S. to parents who are in the country illegally.\n\nJames Ho, a conservative Trump-appointed federal appeals court judge, wrote in the Green Bag legal journal in 2006 that birthright citizenship \u201cis protected no less for children of undocumented persons than for descendants of Mayflower passengers.\u201d\n\nStephen Yale-Loehr, a Cornell university immigration expert, said the case against Trump\u2019s authority is \u201cnot open and shut, but the better view is it would require a constitutional amendment.\u201d\n\nThe Constitution\u2019s citizenship clause was part of the post-Civil War amendments that enshrined the rights of African-Americans. The citizenship clause, in particular, was intended to overturn the Supreme Court\u2019s notorious Dred Scott decision of 1857 that held African-Americans were not citizens.\n\nThe Supreme Court has never ruled squarely about the clause\u2019s application to children of immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally. Trump did not make a distinction between legal and illegal status in his remarks. An 1898 Supreme Court decision held that the U.S.-born son of legal Chinese immigrants was a citizen under the 14th Amendment; a footnote in a 1982 decision suggests there should be no difference for children of foreign-born parents whether they are in the U.S. legally or illegally.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP: \u201cWe\u2019re the only country in the world where a person comes in, has a baby and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United States for 85 years with all of those benefits. It\u2019s ridiculous. It\u2019s ridiculous. And it has to end.\u201d \u2014 interview with \u201cAxios on HBO.\u201d\n\nTHE FACTS: That\u2019s wrong.\n\nThe U.S. is among about 30 countries where birthright citizenship \u2014 the principle of jus soli or \u201cright of the soil\u201d \u2014 is applied, according to the World Atlas and other sources. Most are in the Americas. Canada and Mexico are among them. Most other countries confer citizenship based on that of at least one parent \u2014 jus sanguinis, or \u201cright of blood\u201d \u2014 or have a modified form of birthright citizenship that may restrict automatic citizenship to children of parents who are on their territory legally.\n\nMore broadly, Trump\u2019s view that U.S.-born children of foreigners live a lifetime of taking \u201call those benefits\u201d ignores the taxes they pay, the work they do and their other contributions to society.\n\n___\n\n2016 ELECTION\n\nSARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, White House press secretary: Trump \u201cgot elected by an overwhelming majority of 63 million Americans who came out and supported him and wanted to see his policies enacted.\u201d \u2014 press briefing on Oct. 29\n\nTHE FACTS: Trump did not earn a majority of votes in the 2016 election. He did win the Electoral College, allowing him to capture the presidency.\n\nTrump won nearly 63 million votes compared with more than 65 million for Democrat Hillary Clinton, who racked up lopsided victories in big states such as New York and California, according to election data compiled by The Associated Press. But she lost the presidency due to Trump\u2019s winning margin in the Electoral College, which came after he narrowly won less populous Midwestern states including Michigan and Wisconsin.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar, Colleen Long and Mark Sherman in Washington and Elliot Spagat in San Diego contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFind AP Fact Checks at http://apne.ws/2kbx8bd\n\nFollow @APFactCheck on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APFactCheck\n\nEDITOR\u2019S NOTE _ A look at the veracity of claims by political figures\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

He grouped the two countries together with Nicaragua into a \u201ctroika of tyranny,\u201d reprising the \u201caxis of evil\u201d he once decried as an official in the George W. Bush administration.\n\nBolton, an inveterate Cold Warrior, pointed to a \u201ctriangle of terror stretching from Havana to Caracas to Managua\u201d that was \u201cthe cause of immense human suffering, the impetus of enormous regional instability, and the genesis of a sordid cradle of communism in the Western Hemisphere.\u201d\n\nOn one level, this could be boilerplate rhetoric from any hard-line Republican administration. The specter of Latin American leftism has long haunted Washington in the forms of communist leaders such as Fidel Castro, Marxist guerrillas such as the Sandinistas or left-wing populists such as Venezuela\u2019s Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and Bolivia\u2019s Evo Morales.\n\nOn the other hand, the Trump administration has been willing to act on its ideological caprices, ordering travel bans and unraveling major diplomatic agreements. In addition to the new sanctions, Trump has also undone the brief Obama-era thaw with Cuba. But it\u2019s not clear what the White House will achieve with its new, confrontational posture.\n\n\u201cIt is true what they say that these are three regimes that are horrible and deserve to be treated as pariahs, but nothing has worked so far,\u201d Mois\u00e9s Na\u00edm, a distinguished fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said to my colleague Josh Rogin. \u201cCuba has been a challenging issue for every administration since the Bay of Pigs invasion, and no American president has been able to solve that puzzle. So, let\u2019s see if they have come up with a new remedy, a new strategy, a new regional approach. Right now, we don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nBolton made another comment that was perhaps even more revealing of the administration\u2019s outlook. He hailed the election of \u201clike-minded leaders\u201d in the region such as Brazil\u2019s president-elect, Jair Bolsonaro. The victory of such a far-right candidate, Bolton said, demonstrated \u201ca growing regional commitment to free-market principles, and open, transparent, and accountable governance.\u201d\n\nHad a very good conversation with the newly elected President of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, who won his race by a substantial margin. We agreed that Brazil and the United States will work closely together on Trade, Military and everything else! Excellent call, wished him congrats! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 29, 2018\n\nIt was a strange way to describe a man who, as readers of Today\u2019s WorldView know, is notorious for his racist, homophobic and misogynist rhetoric and has cheered the brutal legacy of Brazil\u2019s military dictatorship. His chief economist, Paolo Guedes, champions the liberalizing reforms of the late Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet \u2014 a man better known for the blood on his hands than his fiscal policy.\n\n\u201cPerhaps the personality whom Bolsonaro most resembles is Roberto D\u2019Aubuisson, the late Salvadoran politician and former National Guard major who, in collusion with the security forces and conservative landowners, ran the death squads that captured and killed thousands of suspected leftists in a campaign of terror aimed at \u2018purifying the fatherland,\u2019\u201d wrote the New Yorker\u2019s Jon Lee Anderson. \u201cNot since the early nineteen-eighties, when much of Latin America was in the grip of anti-Communist dictators who formed a cabal to kill and disappear the hemisphere\u2019s leftists, has a politician emerged with such a vituperous discourse.\u201d\n\nNone of this appears to be of much concern to Trump. The U.S. president was one of the first major leaders to congratulate Bolsonaro on his electoral victory on Twitter, effusively cheering a fellow nationalist onto the hemispheric stage. (French President Emmanuel Macron, by contrast, offered a more guarded welcome to Bolsonaro, stressing \u201cdemocratic principles\u201d and the importance of Brazil holding the line on climate policy.)\n\nCritics place both men within a broader trend of demagogic right-wing leaders who have swept to power over the past two years. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that authoritarian leaders around the world have drawn inspiration from the fact that the leader of the world\u2019s oldest and most powerful democracy seems to delight in shattering democratic norms,\u201d leftist Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) wrote in a column two months ago.\n\nBrazil\u2019s new President Jair Bolsonaro is a far-right authoritarian who has praised the former military dictatorship and referred to black activists as \u201canimals.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt's very troubling that Bolton sees Bolsonaro as \u201clike-minded\u201d with Trump. Even more troubling, he\u2019s probably right. https://t.co/ypsnAuLDkV \u2014 Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) November 2, 2018\n\nIn Bolsonaro, Trump may see an ideological fellow politician who shares his contempt for international agreements and organizations. Bucking years of Brazilian diplomacy, Bolsonaro has announced that his government will move Brazil\u2019s embassy in Israel to Jerusalem and may shutter the Palestinian mission in Brasilia. Following so closely in Trump\u2019s footsteps deepens the sense of a new right-wing axis emerging in world politics, one within which the Brazilian leader may play a prominent role.\n\nThis may be good news for Trump, particularly if he seeks to turn up the heat on Venezuela \u2014 Bolsonaro has advocated a far tougher line against Brazil\u2019s dysfunctional northern neighbor than his more liberal opponents. But there\u2019s a risk of his rule drifting into the tyranny derided by Bolton.\n\n\u201cThe new Brazilian president\u2019s policy positions will likely please Washington in the short term. But what their longer-term effect will be, for both Brazil and the United States, is worth asking,\u201d analysts Roberto Simon and Brian Winter noted in Foreign Affairs.\n\n\u201cBolsonaro\u2019s past statements and current policy proposals suggest that his presidency will pose a direct threat to democratic norms and institutions, the rule of law, social justice, and the improvement of security in Brazil,\u201d the authors continued. \u201cThe past 30 years have been an era of progress for most of Latin America, thanks in large part to those values.

(Steven Senne/AP)\n\nBrady-Rodgers II pretty much encapsulated the careers of the two all-time quarterbacking greats.\n\nAaron Rodgers did all that he could to compensate for the Green Bay Packers\u2019 shortcomings in other areas.\n\nTom Brady found a way to win.\n\nNo one should have expected anything different Sunday night in Foxborough, Mass.\n\nThe New England Patriots prevailed, 31-17, by scoring a pair of fourth-quarter touchdowns. As a result, Brady and the Patriots could be headed to another Super Bowl. For Rodgers and the Packers, the season is coming unraveled.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t one of Brady\u2019s greatest performances. He actually looked confused at times by the Packers\u2019 defensive schemes drawn up by coordinator Mike Pettine. That hardly ever happens.\n\nBut Brady\u2019s 22-for-35, 294-yard passing performance was good enough for the Patriots to win on a night when they were without tight end Rob Gronkowski and rookie running back Sony Michel. Brady did not throw an interception. He had a touchdown pass on a 55-yard strike to wide receiver Josh Gordon to cap the scoring and seal the outcome.\n\n\u201cI think we fought pretty hard,\u201d Brady told NBC after the game. \u201cIt was even after three quarters and we played pretty good in the fourth quarter. The defense made so many plays. I\u2019m glad we kept them off the field there at the end. So it was a great job.\u201d\n\n[NFL Week 9 wrap: Scores, news, analysis and more]\n\nRemember the questions about whether the Patriots, after beginning the season with two losses in three games, were in trouble? Those are a distant memory. They\u2019ve won six straight games to up their record to 7-2. They\u2019ve beaten their top challenger in the AFC, the Kansas City Chiefs. They very well could be headed toward the No. 1 seed in the AFC playoffs and yet another Super Bowl appearance.\n\nWith Michel out and James White somewhat limited Sunday night after limping off the field at one point, the Patriots got a boost from Cordarrelle Patterson. The veteran wide receiver and kick returner filled in at running back and was extremely effective, with 11 carries for 61 yards and a touchdown.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I said before the game: Everyone\u2019s got to contribute,\u201d Brady said. \u201cEveryone made plays. The defense played great. Offensively we ran it with CP. What a great performance he had running \u2026. Everyone made some great plays.\u201d\n\nBrady won only his second career matchup with Rodgers as NFL starters. Rodgers was good but not overwhelmingly so. He played without a brace on his left knee for the first time since the injury he suffered in the season opener. He moved around well and he threw two touchdown passes in a 24-for-43, 259-yard passing performance. But cameras caught him grimacing at times in the second half as he held his right wrist, although he never left the game.\n\nThere was plenty for the Packers to overcome. After just trading a safety, Ha Ha Clinton-Dix, to the Washington Redskins, they found themselves further shorthanded Sunday night when safety Jermaine Whitehead was ejected for slapping the face mask of Patriots center David Andrews after a play.\n\nThe NFL said that Whitehead was ejected from the game \u201cfor striking the head of an opponent.\u201d The ejection decision was subject to review by instant replay and was confirmed by the league office in New York. Even so, some observers felt the ejection was overly harsh for an openhanded slap.\n\nThe Green Bay defense became further depleted by a hamstring injury to cornerback Kevin King and an ankle injury to linebacker Blake Martinez, who left the field on a cart but later returned to the game. On offense, right tackle Bryan Bulaga exited with a knee injury.\n\nEven so, the Packers had their chances. They rallied from deficits of 10-3 and 17-10 to tie the game at 17 entering the fourth quarter. The Green Bay defense provided a third-quarter goal line stand and the Packers were driving toward a possible go-ahead score when tailback Aaron Jones lost a fumble on the opening play of the final quarter.\n\nThat turnover led to a Patriots touchdown scored by White on a one-yard run, set up by a trick play on which Brady threw a lateral to wide receiver Julian Edelman, who threw the ball back across the field to White for a 37-yard catch and run. On a night when Brady and Rodgers were playing, Edelman actually had the game\u2019s highest passer rating at 118.8.\n\nThe Packers have returned from their bye week to lose consecutive road games to the Los Angeles Rams and the Patriots. They might have beaten the Rams if not for Ty Montgomery\u2019s late fumble on a kickoff return. They might have beaten the Patriots if not for Jones\u2019s fumble.\n\nBut the what-ifs that are accumulating so rapidly do the Packers no good. They are 3-4-1 and looking at an uphill climb to get back into the NFC playoff race. They still have difficult road games remaining at Seattle, Minnesota and Chicago. Will another season of Rodgers\u2019s prime be wasted?\n\n\u201cHe made a lot of good plays tonight,\u201d Brady said of Rodgers. \u201cIt\u2019s still great to see him play and play so well.\u201d\n\nBut for Brady, it was even better to win.\n\nAs usual.\n\nRead more on the NFL:\n\nSaints and Rams show off the best the NFL has to offer\n\nThe Ravens are reeling, and they have themselves to blame\n\nSteelers continue \u2018Le\u2019Veon who?' portion of their season with crucial win", "An Iranian checks various currency rates at an exchange shop window in downtown Tehran, Iran, Monday, Nov. 5, 2018. Iran greeted the re-imposition of U.S. sanctions on Monday with air defense drills and a statement from President Hassan Rouhani that the nation faces a \u201cwar situation,\u201d raising Mideast tensions as America\u2019s maximalist approach to the Islamic Republic takes hold. (Ebrahim Noroozi/Associated Press)\n\nTEHRAN, Iran \u2014 The U.S. re-imposed all sanctions Monday on Iran that once were lifted under its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, grinding further down on the Islamic Republic\u2019s already-ailing economy in what President Hassan Rouhani described as a \u201cwar situation\u201d now facing Tehran.\n\nIran ran televised air defense drills showing soldiers cheering the downing of a drone, but otherwise held back from any military response over U.S. efforts to curtail what Washington calls its \u201cmalign activities\u201d across the Middle East. While previously warning it could ramp up its nuclear program, Iran still honors the atomic accord now limiting its enrichment of uranium, according to the United Nations.\n\nAs Iranian officials struck a martial tone, the strain could be felt on the streets of Tehran. It lurked in shops emptied by the country\u2019s rapidly depreciating currency. It could be felt in the lines at currency exchange shops. And it could be heard in the stress of the voices of people struggling to buy medicine.\n\n\u201cWhen the dollar rate went up, prices for medicine went up by 80 percent,\u201d said a man who identified himself only as Amidi, who suffers from mental illness and has a son with cancer. \u201cI can\u2019t buy my own medicine anymore. I haven\u2019t taken my medicine for two months, because I can\u2019t afford it.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Treasury Department imposed penalties on more than 700 Iranian and Iranian-linked individuals, entities, aircraft and vessels in the new sanctions. Among those are 50 Iranian banks and subsidiaries, more than 200 people and ships, Iran\u2019s state-run airline Iran Air and more than 65 of its planes.\n\nThe new sanctions particularly hurt Iran\u2019s vital oil industry, which provides a crucial source of hard currency. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told journalists in Washington the sanctions already had cost Iran the sale of over 1 million barrels of crude oil a day.\n\n\u201cOur objective is to starve the Iranian regime of the revenue it uses to fund violent and destabilizing activities throughout the Middle East and, indeed, around the world,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cThe Iranian regime has a choice: It can either do a 180-degree turn from its outlawed course of action and act like a normal country, or it can see its economy crumble.\u201d\n\nThe administration of President Donald Trump, who campaigned on a promise of tearing up the nuclear deal, insists it does not seek \u201cregime change\u201d in Iran through the sanctions. It says It wants Iran to radically change its policies, including its support for regional militant groups and its development of long-range ballistic missiles.\n\nHowever, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and his national security adviser John Bolton both have given speeches advocating overthrowing Iran\u2019s theocratic government.\n\nAnalysts feared in the run-up to the sanctions that global oil prices could spike on tight supply and increasing demand. However, the Trump administration allowed some of its allies \u2014 Greece, India, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Turkey \u2014 as well as rival China to continue to purchase Iranian oil as long as they work to reduce imports to zero. That caused prices of benchmark Brent crude to dip down from over $80 a barrel in recent days. It traded up over $73 a barrel Monday after the sanctions took effect.\n\n\u201cWe have the toughest sanctions ever imposed but on oil we want to go a little bit slower because I don\u2019t want to drive the oil prices in the world,\u201d Trump said on Thursday. \u201cI could get the Iran oil down to zero immediately, but it would cause a shock to the market.\u201d\n\nRouhani, whose signature achievement was the nuclear deal, promised that Iran would still be able to sell its oil on the international market. Its national oil company has started selling crude oil to private companies who then can sell to anonymous buyers abroad as a means to get around the sanctions.\n\n\u201cWe are in an economic war situation. We are standing up to a bullying enemy,\u201d Rouhani told government officials in televised remarks, invoking Iran\u2019s ruinous 1980s war with Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. \u201cYesterday, Saddam was in front us; today Trump is front of us. There is no difference. We must resist and win.\u201d\n\nIranian state television broadcast video of air defense systems and anti-aircraft batteries in two-day military maneuvers underway across a vast stretch of the country\u2019s north. It included surface-to-air missiles shooting down a drone.\n\nIran is already in the grip of an economic crisis. Its national currency, the rial, now trades at 150,000 to one U.S. dollar; a year ago, it was about 40,500 to $1. The economic chaos sparked mass anti-government protests at the end of last year, resulting in nearly 5,000 reported arrests and at least 25 people being killed. Sporadic demonstrations still continue.\n\nGholamali Khoshroo, Iran\u2019s U.N. ambassador, accused the U.S. of \u201cbrazenly and boldly\u201d violating a U.N. Security Council resolution that unanimously endorsed the nuclear deal by re-imposing sanctions, and he called for \u201ca collective response by the international community.\u201d\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said China regretted the U.S. decision, adding the accord \u201cshould be comprehensively and effectively implemented\u201d despite the fact that the United States pulled out of it in May.\n\nEuropean nations still a part of the nuclear deal have sought to offer protection for its firms to continue trading with Iran. However, many international firms already have backed out of the country, fearful of facing American sanctions.\n\nThat fear also has kept shoppers out of the stores in Tehran.\n\n\u201cCheck the shops here one by one. There are no customers,\u201d said Hossein Ahmadi, who sells purses. \u201cPeople have kept their money for rainy days out of fear of sanctions.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, there are fears of other threats. Iran\u2019s Telecommunication Minister Mohammad Javad Azeri Jahromi and his deputy, Hamid Fatahi, both tweeted about a cyberattack targeting the country\u2019s communications infrastructure, without elaborating. They blamed Israel for the attack and both referenced Stuxnet, which destroyed thousands of centrifuges involved in Iran\u2019s contested nuclear program in 2011. Stuxnet is widely believed to be an American and Israeli creation, though neither country has acknowledged being behind the attack.\n\nIsrael\u2019s Foreign Ministry declined to comment on the Iranian claim. Last week, Gen. Gholam Reza Jalali, the head of country\u2019s military unit in charge of combating sabotage, said Rouhani\u2019s cellphone was tapped recently.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a longtime foe of Iran, lauded the sanctions as \u201chistoric,\u201d saying they will \u201cstrangle\u201d what he described as Iranian state-sponsored terrorism. Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman tweeted that the U.S. decision to restore sanctions \u201cis the sea change the Middle East has been waiting for.\u201d\n\n___\n\nGambrell reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

The Trump administration is announcing the reimposition of all U.S. sanctions on Iran that had been lifted under the 2015 nuclear deal. (Associated Press)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration was caught between allies at home and abroad and the reality of global economics as it reinstated sanctions Monday on Iran, forced to carve out exemptions for important allies and back off on measures that could have been even more punishing for Tehran.\n\nThe U.S. granted waivers to allow China and seven close U.S. partners and allies to continue importing Iranian crude and other petroleum products without penalty, bowing to concerns that a complete end to Iran\u2019s exports would cause a major spike in world oil prices and cause other economic disruptions. Trump conceded that reality on his way to a last-minute campaign event a day before critical midterm congressional elections.\n\n\u201cWe have the toughest sanctions ever imposed but on oil we want to go a little bit slower because I don\u2019t want to drive the oil prices in the world,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cI could get the Iran oil down to zero immediately, but it would cause a shock to the market.\u201d\n\nThe newly reinstated sanctions target Iran\u2019s energy, financial and shipping sectors and are aimed at forcing Iran to end ballistic missile program and end its support for armed movements throughout the Middle East.\n\nThe measures restore all the U.S. sanctions that had been lifted under the 2015 accord that gave Iran billions of dollars in sanctions relief in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program, a deal that Obama administration critics had argued was too soft on the Islamic Republic.\n\nIn reinstating the measures, the Treasury Department imposed penalties on more than 700 Iranian and Iranian-linked individuals, entities, aircraft and vessels. Among those are 50 Iranian banks and subsidiaries, more than 200 people and ships, Iran\u2019s state-run airline Iran Air and more than 65 of its planes.\n\nThe sanctions freeze any assets that those targeted have in U.S. jurisdictions and bar Americans from doing business with them. They will also affect non-Iranian companies that deal with sanctioned Iranian firms and officials.\n\nYet, while the administration seeks to cut off Iran\u2019s oil revenue, it is allowing Greece, India, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Turkey to continue purchasing Iranian oil as long as they work to reduce imports to zero.\n\n\u201cWhen I look at the list, it\u2019s obviously very large economies that still in many ways depend on Iran oil imports and at this time don\u2019t have any strong alternatives,\u201d said Brian Katulis, a senior fellow at Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank.\n\n\u201cThis is part of the Trump team\u2019s trying to balance its maximum pressure campaign against Iran versus its concerns over where the global prices of oil might go and how that could negatively impact everyone including America. I don\u2019t support this policy, but if you are going down this path, it\u2019s a way to lessen the risk of economic blowback in America.\u201d\n\nThree of the eight waiver recipients \u2014 Greece, Italy and Turkey \u2014 are members of NATO. Japan and South Korea have mutual defense treaties with the U.S. and have a key part in the North Korea denuclearization initiative. India, the world\u2019s largest democracy, plays a critical role in the administration\u2019s \u201cIndo-Pacific\u201d strategy, which seeks to unite countries in the region into forming a bloc to counter China\u2019s growing assertiveness.\n\nAll of them lobbied heavily to be granted the six-month exemptions while promising to further reduce or end their imports and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the waivers were based on the specific circumstances of each and the need \u201cto ensure a well-supplied oil market.\u201d\n\nChina is the single-largest importer of Iranian oil and forcing it to look elsewhere to fuel its dynamic economy would likely have rocked the market.\n\nFor some waiver recipients, domestic concerns were paramount.\n\nSouth Korea, for example, is reliant on oil imports to drive its economy. It had been consultation with the Trump administration since the U.S. pullout from the Iran nuclear deal in May. Seoul says it will reduce oil imports from Iran by a \u201csignificant\u201d amount but the waiver will allow it to maintain a stable supply of a light form of crude known as condensate.\n\nSeeking to deflect criticism from some Iran hawks concerned that the sanctions don\u2019t go far enough, Pompeo stressed that U.S. pressure on countries to stop buying Iranian oil had already reduced its exports by more than a million barrels of crude per day costing the country $2.5 billion revenue.\n\nSome leading Iran hawks appeared to agree with the administration\u2019s approach.\n\n\u201cWe are encouraged that these waivers will only be temporary and one-time,\u201d said United Against a Nuclear Iran, a prominent group that was harshly critical of the nuclear deal and the sanctions relief it brought.\n\nIn addition to the oil exemptions, Pompeo said limited waivers had been issued to allow European and other firms to continue conversion work on three of Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities.\n\n\u201cPermitting these specific activities to continue is an interim measure that preserves oversight of Iran\u2019s civil nuclear program,\u201d the State Department said. \u201cThis oversight enhances our ability to constrain Iran\u2019s program and keep pressure on the regime while we pursue a new, stronger deal.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMaria Danilova and Matthew Pennington contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

When the tiger tried to escape, the villagers crushed it under the wheels of a tractor.\n\nThe village is inside the core zone of the Dudhwa Tiger Reserve in Lakhimpur Khiri area, some 250 kilometers (155 miles) southeast of Lucknow, the state capital of Uttar Pradesh.\n\nKilling a tiger in protected areas is illegal, and the reserve\u2019s director, Ramesh Pandey, said a case under the Wildlife Protection Act would be registered with police.\n\nVillagers said the tiger injured another person in an attack about 10 days ago.\n\nThe tiger is India\u2019s national animal and it is categorized as endangered under the Wildlife Protection Act. Tiger attacks in the country are common, with government data from last year showing an average of more than one person killed per day in conflict with a wild tiger or elephant over the previous three years.\n\nOn Friday, hunters shot and killed another man-eating tiger in western Maharashtra state, wildlife forest official Nagesh Gorle said. Officials blamed the female tiger for killing 13 people over the last two years.\n\nGorle said they had planned to capture the tiger but it attacked hunters even after being hit by a tranquilizer dart, he said.\n\nOfficials said the tiger had evaded capture at least four times and had terrified inhabitants living near vast swaths of forest where it mauled herders and farmers, along with cows, goats and horses.\n\nThe human conflict with tigers has gradually increased since the 1970s, when India started a tiger conservation program that carved out sanctuaries in national parks and made it a crime to kill them. Though methods for counting tigers have changed, a census suggests the population of about 1,800 tigers then grew to 2,226 in 2014.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(Natacha Pisarenko/Associated Press)\n\nBUENOS AIRES, Argentina \u2014 A battery of corruption allegations and criminal charges against former President Cristina Fernandez hasn\u2019t fazed a strong band of hard-core backers, who have helped make her a leading \u2014 if undeclared \u2014 contender to regain power in next year\u2019s elections.\n\nHundreds of supporters, some waving signs saying, \u201cStrength, Cristina!\u201d thronged the street outside when investigators searched the former president\u2019s apartment recently.\n\nCries of support for Fernandez rise from crowds during protests against the austerity policies of the conservative who replaced her as president, Mauricio Macri.\n\n\u201cNow more than ever, soldiers of Cristina\u201d read a sign at a demonstration demanding improved conditions for disabled retirees.\n\n\u201cMany women voted for the government of Mauricio Macri and now they regret it,\u201d Teresa Rollano said while walking arm-in-arm with a friend who carried that sign. \u201cThe people want Cristina because she represents the working class. She has given us all of our rights.\u201d\n\nA recent survey by local pollster Ricardo Rouvier & Associates said Fernandez is neck-and-neck with Macri in terms of support ahead of the October 2019 election.\n\nThat\u2019s remarkable backing for a politician who faces numerous formal investigations into alleged bribery, money laundering and criminal association during her own administration from 2007 to 2015 and that of her late husband Nestor Kirchner from 2003 to 2007.\n\nFernandez, now a senator, hasn\u2019t been convicted of any crimes \u2014 a first trial is scheduled to start in February \u2014 and she fiercely denies any wrongdoing, accusing officials of persecuting her to distract from the current economic crisis.\n\nBut the Argentine press has been filled with picturesque scandals: bags of millions of dollars in cash tossed over a convent wall, the mysterious death of a prosecutor who accused Fernandez of a cover-up, the corruption conviction of her former vice president.\n\nPart of her strength stems from disenchantment with Macri, whose budget-cutting efforts have forced thousands out of public jobs, raised electricity bills and hiked bus fares without managing to revive the economy or rein in soaring prices. His decision this year to seek IMF aid to help has roused fears among those who blame the international agency for a devastating economic crash in 2001, when Argentina\u2019s government was forced into the largest debt default in history to that point and millions of Argentines were plunged into poverty.\n\nMany credit Kirchner and Fernandez for leading the country out of that crisis, even if Macri\u2019s backers blame Fernandez\u2019s policies for eventually creating the country\u2019s current woes.\n\nUnder Fernandez, \u201cI was able to buy a new car, fix my house and travel on a plane for the first time,\u201d said Gloria Buffarini, a hairdresser. \u201cI used to pay 600 pesos a month (about $16) for electricity. Now, it\u2019s 3,000 (about $80).\n\nFernandez\u2019s supporters credit her for nationalizing the pension system, keeping energy cheap through subsidies and redirecting revenue to the poor through handouts, and see her as a trailblazer for women\u2019s advancement.\n\nThe former president\u2019s appeal also flows from her leadership of a powerful \u2014 if often fragmented \u2014 populist tide in Argentine politics that originated with strongman Juan Domingo Peron in the 1940s and from progressive social policies she passed in the face of opposition from powerful business interests.\n\nBut she also inspires deep animosity. Detractors blame her for endemic corruption and the deterioration of Argentina\u2019s economy, which was choked by restrictions on imports, exports and foreign currency exchanges in the latter part of her administration.\n\n\u201cNot since Peron has there been another leader who has generated such a situation of love and hate,\u201d said Mariel Fornoni of the Management & Fit consultancy. She said Fernandez has a \u201chard core of followers who are going to vote for her no matter what she does.\u201d\n\nFernandez infuriates people like Patricio Canbelari, a language teacher, who said, \u201cMost want to see her arrested,\u201d and called her a \u201cwhite-gloved thief.\u201d\n\nFernandez\u2019s former public works secretary was arrested in 2016 when he was caught tossing bags containing more than $9 million over the walls of a convent. He later agreed to cooperate with prosecutors, joining other witnesses in accusing Fernandez and her son of overseeing a plan to skim millions of dollars from public works projects.\n\nJudges also are investigating allegations published by the newspaper La Nacion that a senior official\u2019s chauffeur kept detailed diaries of millions of dollars in cash payments, including some delivered to the presidential offices and to Fernandez\u2019s private home.\n\nFernandez, along with other former officials, also faces trial on charges that she covered up the role of Iranians in a 1994 terrorist bombing at a Jewish center in Argentina\u2019s capital. The prosecutor who first recommended charges against her, Alberto Nisman, died mysteriously of a gunshot wound four days later \u2014 a case that is still under investigation.\n\nFernandez\u2019s former vice president, Amado Boudou, is in prison, appealing a sentence for bribery and business incompatible with his public office. He was accused of using shell companies and middlemen to take over the only company with contracts to print Argentina\u2019s currency.\n\nFernandez\u2019s Senate seat grants her immunity from arrest but not from prosecution. That immunity could be lifted only by an unlikely vote of two-thirds of the country\u2019s senators. While a conviction might theoretically bar her from running for office, that would only occur after appeals were exhausted \u2014 a process that would take many years.\n\nFornoni said some Argentines believe that although corruption was rife during Fernandez\u2019s term, it exists in Macri\u2019s government as well.\n\n\u201cThey say: \u2018They were probably corrupt, but I lived better,\u2019\u201d Fornoni said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press journalist Paul Byrne contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Tired, swollen and blistered feet are one of the biggest challenges for the thousands of Central American migrants making their way through southern Mexico in hopes of starting new lives in the United States. (Rebecca Blackwell, File/Associated Press)\n\nCORDOBA, Mexico \u2014 Tired, swollen and blistered feet are among the biggest challenges for the thousands of Central American migrants making their way through southern Mexico in hopes of starting new lives in the United States.\n\nThree weeks of pounding the hot asphalt of highways every day takes a toll, especially for those plodding along in flimsy flip flops. Whenever possible, the migrants discard damaged footwear, replacing them with donated shoes found at stops along the way or with spare pairs they carry in backpacks.\n\nThe most grueling days demand treks of more than 100 miles (160 kilometers). Migrants eager to find strength in numbers must keep that pace to remain with the group. And they do so in cheap shoes and sweat-drenched socks, which they eagerly peel off at the end of each day.\n\nBlisters are a nasty foe for migrant feet, young and old alike. Red Cross personnel at waystations bandage swollen feet or apply antiseptic to broken blisters. Children wince as their wounds are treated. Flies gather on open sores. The risk of infection is high.\n\n\u201cThese are extreme conditions,\u201d says Ignacio Escotto, a Mexican vascular surgeon who specializes in treating extremities. Unrelenting contact with hot pavement will cause the feet to swell, he says, while dehydration and malnutrition wreak havoc on soft tissue. \u201cAt the end of the day, this articulation must be painful.\u201d\n\nYet the migrants hobble through the pain, determined to reach the U.S. They grin and bear it as they limp along. Those who can no longer take it bow out of the caravan. The Mexican government says around 3,000 migrants have applied for refuge in Mexico in recent weeks and about 500 have asked for assistance to return to their countries of origin.\n\nOn Sunday, 21-year-old Marisol Salamanca dug into a pile of donated shoes at a sports facility in Cordoba in search of a replacement for the sandals she has padded around in since leaving El Salvador several weeks earlier. \u201cI keep tripping and hurting myself,\u201d she said.\n\nDarwin Hueso, a 39-year-old-farmer from Honduras, was also thrilled to find fresh shoes, even though they were a bit tight and formal. The soles of the work boots he has been wearing for more than 21 days are inflexible and tough.\n\nAdan Lara Barahona, 62, a wiry rancher from Potrerillos, Honduras, dismissed the blisters on his feet as a minor nuisance. \u201cThey are drying out already,\u201d he said, complaining instead of dizziness brought on by a severe respiratory infection.\n\nThere\u2019s no turning back for Lara Barahona, who says gangs killed his wife and two of his children seven months ago when he didn\u2019t pay them protection money.\n\nMany of the about 4,000 migrants in the caravan have now covered more than 800 miles since setting out from Honduras on Oct. 13, hitching rides on flatbed trucks when possible and they face another more than 800-mile trek to the nearest U.S. border crossing. Clamors have grown in recent days for buses to transport scores from the caravan to the Mexican capital, where the fatigued travelers hope to find respite and medical treatment. Those buses haven\u2019t come.\n\nThe group now finds itself in the Gulf state of Veracruz, traversing what some call the \u201croute of death\u201d because of the large number of migrants who have disappeared in the state in recent years. It is unclear what part of the U.S. border they will aim for eventually, but their latest overnight stay in Veracruz could be one of their last before they head to Mexico City, a potential launching spot for a broader array of destinations.\n\nInspired by their progress and outpouring of support from townspeople along the way, several smaller caravans of migrants have formed in Central America in recent weeks in an attempt to improve their odds of making it to the U.S.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Mark Stevenson reported in Cordoba and AP writer Amy Guthrie reported from Mexico City.

China and India are closely watching the constitutional crisis in Sri Lanka, the latest venue for their struggle for geopolitical supremacy in South Asia. (Eranga Jayawardena/Associated Press)\n\nCOLOMBO, Sri Lanka \u2014 China and India are closely watching the constitutional crisis in Sri Lanka, which has been a battleground in their struggle for geopolitical supremacy in South Asia.\n\nChinese and Indian diplomats have been careful not to overtly take sides in the political turmoil, which has seen President Maithripala Sirisena oust Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, replace him with former strongman Mahinda Rajapaksa, and suspend Parliament.\n\nWickremesinghe, meanwhile, has holed up at the prime minister\u2019s residence and insisted he is Sri Lanka\u2019s rightful leader.\n\nThe caution exercised by the Asian giants stands in contrast to calls from Western diplomats for Parliament to immediately be summoned for a floor vote on Rajapaksa\u2019s appointment and underscores the economic and military importance the countries place on the Indian Ocean island nation.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re hedging their bets,\u201d said Bharath Gopalaswamy, director of the Atlantic Council\u2019s South Asia Center. India and China \u201cboth have stakes in the global system and want to play a bigger role, so they have to signal they\u2019ll work with whomever.\u201d\n\nFor China, Sri Lanka is a critical link in its massive Belt and Road Initiative, which aims to use infrastructure projects to expand trade across a vast arc of 65 countries from the South Pacific through Asia to Africa and Europe. It has handed out billions of dollars in loans for Sri Lankan projects over the past decade.\n\nLocated just 23 kilometers (14 miles) off its southeast coast, India sees Sri Lanka as a bulwark in its military defenses to ward off potential Chinese incursions and also sees the island as a key partner for regional trade. India has grown wary of China\u2019s economic influence over Sri Lanka and was troubled by a 2014 port visit from a Chinese submarine and warship.\n\nSri Lanka\u2019s ties to both nations date back thousands of years. It was a stop along China\u2019s old Silk Road trade routes, where merchants picked up pepper, cinnamon, ivory and pearl.\n\nSri Lanka traces much of its genealogy and culture to India, with folklore saying the island\u2019s majority Sinhalese are descendants of an Indian prince banished there 2,000 years ago.\n\nThe nation\u2019s minority Tamils, meanwhile, are in part the descendants of more than a million tea and rubber plantation workers brought to Sri Lanka from southern India by British colonial rulers in the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\nYet that hasn\u2019t always led to smooth relations. During Sri Lanka\u2019s decadeslong civil war, which pitted Tamil rebels against the government, India intervened in the 1980s by sending a peacekeeping force that quickly found itself engaged in battle with the rebels. They were asked to withdraw a few years later amid allegations of abuses against Tamils.\n\nChina filled the vacuum left by India, providing military assistance that helped the Rajapaksa-led government defeat the rebels in 2009. In 2012, China helped block a UN Human Rights Council resolution demanding that the Sri Lankan government investigate war crimes. It would later pass, but it prompted little action by Rajapaksa, who was in power from 2005 to 2015.\n\nChina is partly involved in the current crisis because of tensions over the billions of dollars of loans it has given to build a network of highways, the Hambantota seaport and airport in Rajapaksa\u2019s home district, and other projects. The most iconic of these has been the $1.5 billion port city being built on reclaimed land off Colombo\u2019s coast.\n\nSri Lanka\u2019s debt more than tripled during Rajapaksa\u2019s presidency, Sri Lankan Central Bank figures show.\n\nNew Delhi and other international critics have called the loans a debt trap.\n\nCentral bank figures , however, show that Sri Lanka\u2019s debt to India stood at 145 billion rupees (about $19.9 billion) in 2017 versus 135 billion rupees (about $18.5 billion) owed to China the same year.\n\nRajapaksa\u2019s defeat at the polls in 2015 was partly a reaction to all of that debt, said Gopalaswamy, the analyst.\n\nLikewise, Wickremesinghe, prime minster from 2015, saw his popularity begin to wane last year after his government handed over operations of the Hambantota port to a Chinese company in a 99-year lease.\n\n\u201cFrom a democracy perspective, there\u2019s been huge public resentment because the quality of these projects is questionable, there\u2019s little parliamentary scrutiny and no one knows where this money ends up,\u201d Gopalaswamy said.\n\nResponding to public outrage over the lease, China in July offered Sirisena a nearly $300 million grant that the president said could be used \u201cfor any project of my wish.\u201d\n\nWith so much at stake, the Chinese ambassador to Sri Lanka, Cheng Xueyuan, was among the first to congratulate Rajapaksa after he was appointed prime minister on Oct. 27. But that day, Cheng also visited Temple Trees, the official prime minister\u2019s residence, where Wickremesinghe has been holed up since his ouster.\n\nChina\u2019s Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said that Cheng\u2019s visits to rival prime ministers was simply part of China\u2019s policy of maintaining \u201cfriendly exchanges will all parties in Sri Lanka,\u201d repeating China\u2019s routine assertion that it doesn\u2019t interfere in the internal affairs of other countries.\n\nBut after the surprise win of an opposition candidate in the Maldives who campaigned on a promise to reduce China\u2019s role in the Indian Ocean archipelago nation, Sri Lanka\u2019s strategic position has increased. If projects in the Maldives are canceled, Sri Lanka would be China\u2019s main Indian Ocean link between Asia and the Seychelles, off the coast of East Africa.\n\nA spokesman for Sri Lanka\u2019s new government, Kehaliya Rambukwella, said Rajapaksa had spoken to Chinese officials about revising the terms of the Hambantota port lease.\n\nNew Delhi doesn\u2019t have many options for how to respond to the crisis, said G. Parthasarthy, a retired Indian diplomat and an expert on Sri Lanka affairs.\n\n\u201cWe would like to see South Asia integrated much more closely with India, so we cannot be seen as taking sides,\u201d Parthasarthy said, adding that India\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi hosted both Rajapaksa and Wickremesinghe in separate visits to New Delhi last month.\n\nThe day after his ouster, Wickremesinghe met with Colombo-based diplomats from the U.S., Britain, Australia, the European Union and India, among others. Many issued statements calling for the country\u2019s constitution and democracy to be respected. Sirisena held his own meeting with foreign diplomats on Oct. 29.\n\nWickremesinghe said he hasn\u2019t received any official support from foreign powers, nor has he sought any.\n\n\u201cI agree with them that the constitution must be followed,\u201d he said.\n\nSince the crisis began, constitutional scholars have argued over whether Sri Lankan law allowed the president to remove the prime minster and appoint someone new.\n\nSirisena on Sunday ordered Parliament to reconvene Nov. 14 for a confidence vote on Rajapaksa. China and India will be closely watching to see if the vote eases or exacerbates the crisis.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Krishan Francis in Colombo and Christopher Bodeen in Beijing contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Voters across the country will go to the polls for what are called \u201cmidterm elections,\u201d and they\u2019ll choose thousands of public officials from members of Congress all the way down to school board members and town councilors.\n\nAmerican elections are different from those in many other democracies, and their rules and customs are often baffling. Here are some answers to readers' questions about how the 2018 midterms work.\n\nWhat exactly are midterm elections?\n\nIn the most literal sense, midterm elections are exactly what their name suggests: the elections that take place halfway through a president's four-year term. That covers a huge range of contests, from congressional seats all the way down to small-town mayoral races and county sheriffs.\n\nU.S. congressional elections, which take place every two years, are the most high-profile contests. In the House of Representatives, the lower chamber, all 435 seats are contested every time. In the Senate, the upper chamber, senators' six-year terms are staggered so that roughly one-third of them are up for election each time. This year, 35 of the 100 Senate seats are up for grabs. All of these term lengths and election dates are set by the U.S. Constitution.\n\nWhen people refer to midterm elections, those congressional votes are usually what they\u2019re thinking of. They offer voters their biggest opportunity in between presidential elections to weigh in on a president\u2019s performance and shift the balance of power if they\u2019re unsatisfied.\n\nThere are also thousands of other races taking place across the country. A majority of U.S. states \u2014 36 of 50 \u2014 will hold elections for governor this year, and the vast majority of state legislatures have elections as well. In many places, voters will also choose judges, sheriffs, mayors and any number of other local officials. All of these elections are governed by state and local laws, not the U.S. Constitution.\n\nState and local races often go relatively unnoticed, even within the United States itself. But governors and state lawmakers wield considerable power, as can big-city mayors. The laws they create for their residents can vary greatly from place to place and sometimes serve as test cases for various policies.\n\nPerhaps even more critically, most states put their legislatures in charge of redrawing the boundaries of the state\u2019s congressional districts (more on that later). This year\u2019s elections will determine which party controls many of those legislatures \u2014 and the governors who can approve or veto them \u2014 when the process next takes place, in 2020. At every level of American government, the effects of midterm elections can last for years.\n\n[If Tuesday is better than expected for Republicans, this number may help explain why]\n\nWhich elections are the most important to watch? We\u2019ll start with the House of Representatives.\n\nWhile there are certainly some compelling individual races to watch, the easiest way to keep track of things is probably by looking at the \u201cgeneric ballot.\u201d This is when pollsters simply ask voters whether they prefer Democrats or Republicans to win control of Congress.\n\nUnlike in many democracies, that number has no effect on any actual races in the United States. But it is an important indicator of which party is likely to come out on top: A party that leads the generic ballot by eight percentage points, as Democrats do at the moment, won\u2019t get exactly 8 percent more seats, but it\u2019s still probably going to win more than the other side overall.\n\nIf voters heavily favor Republicans, for example, many districts that normally have a small or moderate advantage for Democrats will suddenly be vulnerable or vice versa. If you hear people talk about a \u201cwave election,\u201d as they have this year, that\u2019s what they\u2019re talking about \u2014 the fact that many more elections are competitive than normal because of the political mood.\n\nAll of this means that Democrats are the large favorites to win back the House: The news website FiveThirtyEight estimates that they have a roughly 85 percent chance of having the majority of seats come November. But, as was the case in 2016, that still means Republicans have paths to victory as well.\n\n\n\nRep. Beto O'Rourke, the Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate in Texas, attends a rally in Austin on Sunday. (Nick Wagner/Austin American-Statesman via AP)\n\nWhat about the Senate?\n\nOnly a third of the Senate comes up for reelection at a time, which means major political swings that can cause big shifts in the House are rare in the upper chamber.\n\nInstead, control of the Senate is usually determined simply by which states happen to be electing senators that year. If elections are up in more reliably Democratic states, Democrats will probably have a good year and vice versa. This year, the map favors Republicans by a large margin: Democrats must defend 26 of the 35 seats up for election, many of which are in states that voted for Donald Trump in 2016. Republicans can focus on winning back seats from Democrats in favorable places rather than trying to shore up their own senators.\n\nSo while Democrats would have to make a net gain of just two seats to control the Senate, which is split 51 to 49 in the Republicans' favor, their path to do so is much harder. As Washington Post political reporter Amber Phillips wrote in September, \u201cDemocrats will have to have a near-perfect run\u201d of the toughest races. Here are her three most critical ones to watch:\n\nNorth Dakota: Sen. Heidi Heitkamp is the most likely Democrat to fall. In a heavily Republican state, she is extremely vulnerable to losing her seat \u2014 perhaps especially after she voted against the confirmation of controversial Supreme Court nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh. Recent polls have shown Heitkamp trailing significantly. If she loses, it will be a big blow to Democrats' chances of regaining the Senate.\n\nNevada: This is the Democrats' best opportunity to take a seat from Republicans. Nevada has voted for Democrats in the past three presidential races, and a Democrat won the open Senate seat that was up for election in 2016. Nevada\u2019s population is also more than a quarter Latino, and pro-Democratic labor unions play a major role in the state\u2019s politics. Right now, the race is nearly an even toss-up, with Republican Sen. Dean Heller perhaps slightly favored.\n\nIndiana: This is another place where Democrats need one of their senators to hang on in a Republican state. Sen. Joe Donnelly appears in better shape than his counterpart in North Dakota: Polls give him an advantage. If he loses, it could be a sign that Republicans are going to have a better night than forecasters anticipated.\n\n[Anxiety high in campaign\u2019s final days as voters prepare to render judgment on Trumpism]\n\nHow will the results of the midterms affect Trump?\n\nWhen people ask this question, they\u2019re probably really asking about one thing: impeachment. But while impeaching Trump is a rallying cry for his harshest critics \u2014 and, according to polling, is surprisingly popular in general \u2014 it\u2019s unlikely to happen.\n\nImpeachment is actually a two-step process, laid out in the U.S. Constitution. First, the House of Representatives considers the accusations against the president; if it votes in favor of impeachment (it requires just a simple majority), it means that the president has been formally charged. To actually remove him from office, the Senate must then vote to convict him on those charges, which requires a two-thirds majority. Presidents can be impeached without actually being kicked out of the White House, as happened to Bill Clinton in 1998.\n\nAll of this would be a possibility only if Democrats controlled both chambers of Congress, which is unlikely. Even if Democrats win both, their leaders seem lukewarm about impeachment; Nancy Pelosi, the top Democrat in the House, has said that impeaching Trump is \u201cnot a priority.\u201d\n\nWhat Democrats could do is launch more serious investigations into Trump\u2019s conduct regarding Russia, his business dealings or any other matter that they believe Republicans have downplayed. That could turn up damaging new evidence, or it could simply dominate the news as Trump gears up for his reelection campaign. No matter what, though, expect gridlock. If a Democratic House and Republican Senate are battling each other, it\u2019s hard to see any major legislation being passed.\n\n\n\nPresident Trump at a campaign rally at Pensacola International Airport in Florida on Saturday. (Evan Vucci/AP)\n\nFor many people overseas, the U.S. electoral system appears strange \u2014 and seemingly unfair in how it represents the will of voters. Can that system be changed?\n\nThe question of changing the system usually comes up when people talk about presidential elections. U.S. presidents are elected by an indirect system called the electoral college, not by a simple popular vote. The person who gets the most total votes can still lose the presidency, as Hillary Clinton did.\n\nThe electoral college plays no role in any other elections, including the ones taking place Tuesday. But, like the rules that govern congressional elections, it\u2019s part of the U.S. Constitution. Changing those rules requires amending the Constitution rather than just passing a new law, and the bar for amendments is high. They have to be approved by two-thirds majorities of both chambers of Congress, and then approved again by at least 38 states (there\u2019s also another way, by calling a new constitutional convention, but it has never happened before).\n\nWith the country deeply divided, getting two-thirds of either house of Congress to agree on major changes would be virtually impossible. But it\u2019s not just partisanship that makes changes unlikely.\n\nThe status quo gives smaller states a big advantage. Seats in the House of Representatives are determined by population \u2014 the more residents a state has, the larger its share of the 435 seats. But every state gets two Senate seats no matter what. Small states, regardless of partisanship, aren\u2019t likely to back amendments that would reduce their power.\n\nThere\u2019s more room for experimentation at the state level. States can\u2019t change how they\u2019re represented in Congress, but they can change how their own residents vote. Instead of using the first-past-the-post system \u2014 i.e., whoever gets the most votes wins, even if the top candidate doesn\u2019t reach a majority \u2014 some states require top-two runoffs so that winners get more than 50 percent of the vote, and Maine uses a different system called instant-runoff voting. In reality, though, most states have laws and constitutions that mimic the national government.\n\n[Where the money is going in the final push before Election Day]\n\nWhat about those strangely shaped districts? Why do they exist?\n\nAgain, the answer is (at least partly) in the U.S. Constitution. The Constitution requires that the country take a census every 10 years and that seats in the House of Representatives be divided among the states in proportion to their population. So, once a decade, some states will either gain or lose seats depending on population shifts. The changes are determined automatically according to a mathematical formula.\n\nBut the Constitution doesn\u2019t say how states should draw up the boundaries of those seats; each one is free to use its own method. Many states let their legislatures do it, which is how you get the infamous practice of \u201cgerrymandering\u201d \u2014 creating districts that make little geographical sense to give one party an advantage. The party in power at the start of a decade will obviously try to give itself more seats, either by connecting its own voters to one another in odd ways or by jamming as many opposing voters into the smallest number of seats as possible.\n\nThose maps may later be challenged in court for being grossly unfair and even redrawn by judges. Partisanship and chaos are common.\n\nSeveral states have taken steps to change this. California and Arizona have independent commissions that draw up their maps, and lawmakers and public officials are barred from taking part. Three other states have advisory commissions, which draw up recommendations for their legislatures to pass. Four more have appointed committees, where both parties can appoint members to take part. All of these are attempts to make redistricting a little less partisan and a little more fair.\n\n\n\nCampaign signs outside a polling station on the last day of early voting in Dallas on Friday. (Mike Segar/Reuters)\n\nWhy is so much money spent on elections?\n\nFederal law sets limits on how much people can donate per year to candidates for federal office (Congress or the presidency), political parties or political action committees \u2014 groups that use the money to support candidates. Here\u2019s a list of those limits.\n\nSo if you want to give directly to the candidate or party of your choice, you can\u2019t give that much. The catch is that there are virtually no restrictions if you want to support a candidate indirectly. The law allows certain kinds of outside groups to accept unlimited amounts of money and use it to advocate for or against a candidate. The most famous kind of those groups are \u201csuper PACs,\u201d which have become a way for wealthy donors from both sides to dump money into elections.\n\nTechnically, those independent groups aren\u2019t allowed to coordinate with the campaigns or parties they support. But the definition of \u201ccoordination\u201d is narrow, and super PACs are closely tied to candidates and parties \u2014 they\u2019re often run by close associates of candidates or party insiders. The groups find plenty of creative ways to work closely with the people they support\n\nThese groups are allowed because the Supreme Court considers giving money to political causes a form of speech, which is protected by the First Amendment. The court has loosened the rules on political donations over the years and basically scrapped any limits on those outside groups altogether in 2010.\n\nBut the amount of money in politics actually isn\u2019t rising constantly. The most expensive election year to date was 2008, and things have declined slightly since then. What\u2019s still on the rise is the amount of money spent by those outside groups and, presumably, the influence of the people who fund them.", "Chinese President Xi Jinping is seen on a live broadcast at the media center during the opening ceremony for the China International Import Expo in Shanghai, Monday, Nov. 5, 2018.

Beijing has responded with tariff hikes on $110 billion of American goods.\n\nThe fair lets Beijing show it is \u201cmaking efforts to boost imports,\u201d said Rajiv Biswas, chief Asia economist for IHS Markit.

(Gail Burton/AP)\n\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers remain in the \u201cLe\u2019Veon who?\u201d portion of their season.\n\nHoldout running back Le\u2019Veon Bell still was nowhere to be seen. James Conner, his replacement, again was the focal point of the offense. And the Steelers kept winning, posting their fourth straight victory as they beat the Baltimore Ravens, 23-16, on Sunday at M&T Bank Stadium, enduring an injury scare to quarterback Ben Roethlisberger along the way.\n\nThe Steelers upped their record to 5-2-1 and stayed ahead of the idle Cincinnati Bengals, who are 5-3, atop the AFC North. They added to mounting woes of the Ravens, who suffered their third straight loss to fall to 4-5.\n\nThe hold-your-breath portion of the day for the Steelers came when Roethlisberger landed on his right shoulder as he was tackled by Ravens linebacker Za\u2019Darius Smith at the end of a fourth-quarter run. Roethlisberger remained on the turf by the Steelers\u2019 sideline as members of the team\u2019s medical staff rushed to examine him.\n\n[Biggest moments from an exciting Week 9 of the NFL season]\n\nSuddenly, a Pittsburgh offense that has been without Bell all season \u2014 he has refused to sign his franchise-player deal and report to the team \u2014 was facing the prospect of being without Roethlisberger as well.\n\nBut as Roethlisberger stood on the sideline near midfield, without the medical staff around him, backup Joshua Dobbs delivered a key, 22-yard completion to wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster for a first down on his first regular season NFL pass.\n\n\u201cI almost left Josh in after that play,\u201d Roethlisberger said.\n\nRoethlisberger said he merely had the wind knocked out of him, an assessment echoed by Coach Mike Tomlin.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t breathe for a second,\u201d Roethlisberger said. \u201cYou\u2019re laying there. Once you start getting your breath, you start doing an evaluation. I knew right away it wasn\u2019t my head. Then you start talking shoulders, elbows \u2014 \u00adeverything like that. Once I was able to get up, I knew I\u2019d probably be okay.\u201d\n\nRoethlisberger trotted back on the field after missing only just that one play and soon provided a 51-yard strike to tight end Jesse James that led to a field goal to extend the Steelers\u2019 lead to 10 points.\n\nConner did much of the rest, continuing to thrive in Bell\u2019s absence. He ran for 107 yards on 24 carries. He had seven catches for 56 yards and a touchdown. No, he isn\u2019t Bell, but he is doing a pretty credible impersonation, delivering as both a runner and as a pass-catcher out of the backfield.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to take anything away from James,\u201d Tomlin said. \u201cBut the big boys up front are opening holes. And so it\u2019s a collective effort. James is going above and beyond. I\u2019m more pleased by what he\u2019s doing in the passing game and from a blitz-pickup standpoint. That\u2019s a little bit more unique than the rushing. We knew he could run the ball.\u201d\n\nConner managed only 19 rushing yards on nine carries when the Steelers lost to the Ravens, 26-14, on Sept. 30 in Pittsburgh. The Steelers haven\u2019t lost since, and it was clear practically from the outset Sunday that this game would be different for Conner. He had his fourth straight 100-yard rushing game and fifth of the season.\n\n\u201cThe last time we played them, we had some turnovers and penalties,\u201d Conner said. \u201cWe just had the opportunity to start fast \u00ad[Sunday].\u201d\n\nSome, including Steelers teammates, expected Bell to show up before the season. He didn\u2019t. It was reported that he would join the team during its recent bye week, or possibly after last week\u2019s trade deadline. He still hasn\u2019t.\n\nThe wisdom of Bell staying away and losing more than $855,000 per week of his $14.5 million franchise deal has been debated exhaustively. But there\u2019s no going back now \u2014 not for Bell and not for the Steelers. If Bell wants to play this season, under NFL rules he must report to the Steelers by Nov. 13.\n\nThe inclination for the Steelers and their fans might be to take a vindictive approach. They have done well without Bell, after all, but that probably would be the wrong option.\n\nIf Bell comes back, he probably wouldn\u2019t replace Conner in the lineup but should add value as a complementary player in the running game and as a pass-catcher. He probably would make the Steelers better.\n\nFor the Steelers, the Bell situation isn\u2019t merely about outlasting the Bengals and lapping the \u00adRavens in the division. It\u2019s about battling the New England Patriots and Kansas City Chiefs to be the AFC\u2019s top team. It\u2019s about winning the Super Bowl while they can with Bell, Roethlisberger and wide receiver Antonio Brown.\n\nBell probably can help that cause during whatever is left of his Steelers tenure.", "Tuesday\u2019s midterm election is about many things. It\u2019s about health care and immigration. It\u2019s about the economy. It\u2019s about power and who will hold it, both in Washington and in the states. Above all, it\u2019s about something more elemental: what kind of country Americans see today and want to see in the future. That makes these midterms unlike any in the recent past.\n\nTalk to voters almost anywhere about what this election means to them, and the answer almost invariably involves personal feelings about President Trump and perceptions about the overall state of the country. This debate about America\u2019s divisions has been underway for some time, but Trump has raised the emotional level to something not seen before.\n\nThis is an election that is being fought in individual districts and states, with traditional tools: money, advertising and boots on the ground. Television ads by Democrats hammer Republicans on this or that issue; Republican ads hammer Democrats. Money is coursing through congressional campaigns at levels not seen before. Voter mobilization is as sophisticated and robust as it has ever been. At the margins, those weapons can make a difference.\n\nBut it is the larger question about the values of the nation that has produced what we\u2019ve seen over weeks and months. It is that unsettling, and unsettled, issue that has generated the record amounts of money raised and spent, and the remarkable outpouring of volunteers never before active who are walking precincts and making calls in these final hours \u2014 as they have been for months. It is what has motivated record numbers of people in many states to cast ballots ahead of Election Day. Together, those indicators have stamped this campaign as a once-in-a-generation event.\n\nThis is a divided country, growing more so under this president. Hostility from those in one party toward those in the other has risen. Divisions between urban and rural America have widened. Men and women are on opposites sides in assessments of the president \u2014 including in some marriages \u2014 and the gender gap has been at record levels. Education has become a new and significant fault line, dividing those with college degrees and those without.\n\nOne of the beauties of American politics is its diversity \u2014 from one region to another, from one state to another, and even within states. Each state or region has its own political history and culture. Each has its peculiarities, its good or bad candidates, its local conditions.\n\nA midterm election is like a pointillist painting, each individual race a dot that by Wednesday morning will add up to an image that will provide some answer to the question of the moment: the identity of America as it is today, its aspirations and values, the tone and tenor of the debate.\n\n[Americans talk about the midterm election and voting]\n\nTrump has decided views on these things. Many Americans are thrilled by what he has done or tried to do to shake up a political status quo that left them feeling like outsiders. They see his opponents the same way he often describes them, as enemies of him and of the country. But his presidency also has triggered a powerful backlash that is being felt on this final weekend before Election Day as it has been felt from the day he was inaugurated. His presidency has been a time of raw political anger. The clash of these values and perceptions will produce a rendering on Tuesday.\n\nBecause of geographical differences in a divided America, what happens on Tuesday could hit with unequal force. If things break as now appears possible, the election could wash away the Republican majority in the House and boost Democrats in gubernatorial and state legislative races. But it could leave Democrats still short of a majority in the Senate because nearly all of the most competitive races are now in red states.\n\nPolls show close races for the Senate, the House and governorships. Polls have been wrong before. This could be a wave election, which is to say an election that produces results that overcome structural obstacles and impediments facing the minority party.\n\nIn this case, it is the strength of the economy that could help Republicans avoid the worst and another factor that makes Tuesday\u2019s election different from those past. Look back to 1982, to 1994, to 2006 and to 2010. Those midterms saw the parties of two Republican presidents and two Democratic presidents suffer significant setbacks, but the ingredients were different than they are today \u2014 more customary, more understandable.\n\nThe 1982 midterm election was all about the economy. The country was in a deep recession, and the unemployment rate hit 10 percent in September of that year, the first time it had been in double digits in four decades. Democrats picked up roughly two dozen seats in the House, adding to their majority and dealing a blow to then-President Ronald Reagan.\n\nIn 1994, anger with government, corruption scandals in the House and legislative missteps by then-President Bill Clinton and congressional Democrats led to a historic revolt by the voters. After 40 years of Democratic rule in the House, Republicans led by soon-to-be-speaker Newt Gingrich swept to power on a tide of anti-government sentiment.\n\nBy 2006, the focus of the midterms was on the issue of war and peace, namely the growing unpopularity of the Iraq War, coupled with declining confidence in the leadership of then-President George W. Bush, over both the war and his administration\u2019s handling of the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina. The combination cost Republicans their House majority.\n\nFour years later, Republicans rode a huge groundswell of dissatisfaction to take back the House. In that case, Democrats under the leadership of then-President Barack Obama were done in by the slow pace of recovery from the worst recession since the Great Depression and deep political divisions over the Affordable Care Act, which had passed without Republican support.\n\n[Women will decide the midterms. Here\u2019s what they think about the choice]\n\nAs with so much else about the Trump presidency, this midterm election is in a class of its own, given that it is taking place at a time of economic prosperity. The country\u2019s economic engine is running at peak power, and yet much of the electorate is consumed instead by the style, behavior and personality of the president.\n\nFriday\u2019s employment report from the Labor Department couldn\u2019t have brought better news. All the indicators were moving in the right direction \u2014 job growth, wage growth, the unemployment rate and labor force participation. Yet in the midst of one of the best economies in decades, at a time of rising economic and consumer confidence, the campaign has been about almost anything but that. It has not been, however, about nothing.\n\nTrump has gone back to spreading fear and division over immigrants, particularly a caravan of migrants hundreds of miles from the southern border. He has chosen to play down good news. Finally, on Saturday night in Florida, he spoke at some length about the economy. Mostly, however, he favors broadsides about law and order and what he calls Democratic \u201cmobs.\u201d Which is why the choice for many voters is not about personal finances or the economy or the tax cuts but about whether the country needs change.\n\nTuesday\u2019s results could produce surprises. Elections like this often do. The outcome could change the balance of power in Washington, or it could leave Democrats wondering how they missed out again. It will provide a partial answer to the question of what kind of America this is and should be. A more definitive answer will come later, and by Wednesday, people will shift their focus toward another campaign two years from now.", "\n\nA large office complex leased by Amazon juts out against the small neighboring homes of East Palo Alto, Calif. (Mason Trinca/For The Washington Post)\n\nThis poor city is surrounded by the temples of the new American economy that has, in nearly every way imaginable, passed it by.\n\nJust outside the northern city limit, Facebook is expanding the blocks-long headquarters it built seven years ago. Google\u2019s offices sit just outside the southern edge, and just a few miles to the west, Stanford University stands as the rich proving ground of the economy\u2019s future. Amazon just moved in.\n\nOnly a small fraction of jobs in those companies go to those who live in this city of 30,000 people, one of the region\u2019s few whose population is majority minority. That demography is under threat by the one economic force that has not passed East Palo Alto by \u2014 rapidly rising rents and home prices.\n\n\u201cAmazon Google Facebook \u2013 SOS,\u201d reads a painted bedsheet draped from an RV parked off Pulgas Avenue, one of dozens of trailers where families have come to live rent-free along a gravel path that leads from the city to the San Francisco Bay.\n\nIn the past year, John Mahoni, a burly, affable 41-year-old Latino man, has had a dozen visits from real estate speculators looking to buy his small house off Terra-Villa Street in the city\u2019s worn-down southeast side. The most recent doorstep instant offer: $900,000 in cash, almost three times what he paid less than a decade ago. He turned it down.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve stopped coming because I cussed them out, but I know they were just doing their jobs,\u201d said Mahoni, noting that residents have the right to reject any offer for their property. \u201c. . . There\u2019s no law against not being greedy.\u201d\n\nSkyrocketing housing costs are accelerating a demographic shift across the progressive Bay Area, pushing out Latinos and African Americans into ever-more-distant suburbs to make room for predominantly white technology workers.\n\n\n\nJohn Mahoni spends time with his kids, Monapolly Mahoni, 6, and Ashley Mahoni, 10, in the front of their home in East Palo Alto, Calif. Mahoni has been approached by real estate agents dozens of times since buying his home in 2009. (Mason Trinca/For The Washington Post)\n\nA recent University of California at Berkeley study found that the region has \u201clost thousands of low-income black households\u201d as the result of rising housing costs. The study found no similar effect on the income of or departures in white neighborhoods.\n\nThe process compelling minorities to leave for cheaper cities, caused by Bay Area housing shortages and policies that have cemented those market trends, is in effect resegregating a region that has prided itself on ethnic diversity.\n\nA 30 percent median rent increase from 2000 to 2015 translated into a 21 percent decline in minority households, according to the university\u2019s Urban Displacement Project. While it is hard to pin down the average Bay Area rent, estimates place it above $3,000 a month.\n\nBlack neighborhoods in Oakland, Richmond and Berkeley have seen the most precipitous exodus. Most of those leaving are heading east to the less-expensive agricultural valleys, where political resentment toward the coastal elite has been building for years.\n\n[San Francisco \u2014 rich and poor \u2014 turns to simple street solutions that underscore the city\u2019s complexities]\n\nThe crisis is sharpening as Californians prepare to vote Tuesday on a ballot measure that would make it easier for cities and counties to impose certain forms of rent control.\n\nProposition 10, as the measure is known, is unlikely to win judging by recent polling. But when surveys ask California voters if they support rent control in general, a majority say yes.\n\nThis could mark a turn after decades of unsuccessful attempts to give local governments more authority to control housing costs.\n\nIn 2016, five California cities had ballot measures to adopt new rent-control laws. Two were victorious and two more cities, including Santa Cruz in this region, will vote on similar measures Tuesday. Sacramento, the state capital, will have a rent-control initiative on the 2020 ballot.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a shift in public opinion from rent control being popular to rent control being winnable,\u201d said Dean Preston, executive director of Tenants Together, a nonprofit advocacy group. \u201cPeople have just had enough of the runaway rents and it\u2019s fair to see this is as a wave happening across the state in response.\u201d\n\nRethinking rent-control\n\nBlessed and cursed by geography, East Palo Alto is the next frontier of Bay Area gentrification.\n\nThe city has become a hunting ground for real estate speculators eager to turn even the town\u2019s most decrepit properties into homes and apartments for the tech sector. The offers of cash \u2014 and it is often cash \u2014 have proved irresistible to some homeowners here who never imagined their tiny two-bedroom bungalows would one day be worth seven figures.\n\nLandlords are using evictions and rent hikes to prepare residential neighborhoods for redevelopment at a time when the city\u2019s wealthy neighbors, from San Jose to Sunnyvale, are in some cases actively opposing affordable housing projects.\n\nThe spillover has prompted city leaders here to try to collect some money from the companies building offices with no accompanying housing for the workers.\n\nA measure on the East Palo Alto ballot would impose a tax on each square-foot of large commercial office space, which city leaders say would raise a few million dollars a year for affordable housing and job training. The measure is known colloquially as the \u201ctech tax.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe market is fundamentally broken,\u201d said Daniel Saver, senior attorney for the nonprofit Community Legal Services, who after graduating from Harvard Law School six years ago works with low-income tenants and homeowners here. \u201cThis is a regional problem, and we can\u2019t solve a regional problem on our own.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the early 1980s on, California\u2019s powerful real estate lobby managed to kill every new measure to expand rent control proposed at the state and local levels. The crackdown followed a golden age of tenant rights activism in California when cities such as Berkeley, Santa Monica and East Palo Alto adopted strong rent control measures.\n\nProposition 10 has revived the long-dormant debate at the state level. If passed, the measure would effectively nullify legislation known as the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act, which the state legislature passed in 1995.\n\nCosta-Hawkins did not eliminate all local rent control in the state. But it prohibited local jurisdictions from implementing two regulations that affordable housing advocates say would better protect residents of cities such as this one amid the real estate boom.\n\nOne allowed local governments to limit rent increases when one tenant leaves an apartment and another tenant moves in, even if the new rent remains below market value.\n\n[America is more diverse than ever \u2014 but still segregated]\n\nEast Palo Alto had the regulation in place before Costa-Hawkins. Tenant rights advocates say vacancy control, as the regulation is known, removes the financial incentive for landlords to evict tenants and hike the rent.\n\nThe other allowed local governments to apply rent-control regulations to single-family homes and condominiums. Proposition 10 opponents have focused on this element, in particular, because of its implications for the rights of individual homeowners.\n\nBut its advocates say the idea is to discourage real estate speculators, many of whom are now scouring East Palo Alto for investment homes.\n\nSeveral major state newspapers and a variety of interest groups, including some usually aligned with Democrats, have come out against Proposition 10. By opening the door to new rent-control regulations, its opponents argue, the measure will discourage developers from building housing at a time it is desperately needed.\n\n\u201cThis would only make a bad situation worse,\u201d said Steven Maviglio, a spokesman for the No on Prop 10 campaign. \u201cI think voters are smart enough to realize that there is not a wave-the-magic-wand-and-it\u2019s-fixed solution to this.\u201d\n\n'A semi-feudal society'\n\nMore than three decades ago, the campaign to incorporate this city was propelled by the high cost of housing. East Palo Alto was then a low-income corner of wealthy San Mateo County, and there was little desire among the broader elected leadership to intervene in the housing market. The city became one in 1983.\n\nThe first law that the new city council passed was a rent-control measure. Almost immediately, real estate interests sought to repeal the law through a ballot initiative, fearing it could prompt other cities to follow suit. Voters upheld the law.\n\n\u201cThis fight has become part of our DNA,\u201d said Mayor Ruben Abrica, who served on that first city council and has been in local elected office ever since. \u201cThe forces behind us to have a city government in the first place are the same forces now that demand we do something about affordable housing.\u201d\n\nThe median home price here is more than $1 million, a mixed-blessing milestone passed just a few months ago that culminated a 25 percent price increase over just the past year. But the median household income of $55,170 remains nearly a third of that of neighboring Palo Alto and half that of adjacent Menlo Park.\n\n\u201cSocially and economically in this area we\u2019re living in a semi-feudal society,\u201d Abrica said.\n\n\n\nRVs line Bay Road in East Palo Alto, Calif. In 2018, the city approved for a safe RV parking pilot program which addressed one of aspect to the housing crisis in the Bay Area. (Mason Trinca/For The Washington Post)\n\nThose economic conditions make this city particularly vulnerable to the forces of gentrification. Many longtime residents are income poor and property rich. They are the prime targets for real estate speculators and investment companies with cash.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a gold mine here right now,\u201d said Mahoni, one of those targets, who makes his living trading on eBay.\n\nHe bought his house \u2014 single-story, a patch of lawn surrounded by a chain-link fence out front \u2014 in 2009. That is the era known here as \u201cbefore Facebook,\u201d whose arrival two years later electrified the property market. He paid $330,000.\n\n[As gentrification escalates in Calif., people wonder: Where can the homeless go?]\n\nMahoni grew up in San Mateo County in a house his parents bought for about $112,000 in 1985 and is now worth 10 times that. While he has resisted the money, many of his neighbors have not or have been forced out by rent hikes.\n\nHis cousin is moving to the East Bay from a home on the next street over. He has several friends who in the past year have sold houses and resettled as far away as Tracy, a city about 60 miles east in the San Joaquin Valley.\n\n\u201cNo one wanted any part of us when the crime was high here, and that\u2019s what is also frustrating about all this new interest,\u201d said Mahoni, who intends to leave the home to his seven children. \u201cI tell people only sell if you have to, that you have the character not to sell your soul to the devil. But for some people it\u2019s just too much money not to.\u201d\n\nThe politics of race is also in the city\u2019s genetic makeup.\n\nAn exodus in the early 1970s of white residents from the city, then plagued by one of the highest crime rates in the country, turned the racially mixed student body of its only high school into one that was almost entirely black.\n\nProtests ensued over what demonstrators argued was de facto segregation, and the school, Ravenswood High, closed in 1976. It is now the site of a Home Depot.\n\nEast Palo Alto high school students are bussed into Menlo Park and Atherton, far wealthier neighborhoods where campuses are tucked among walled communities.\n\nSigns stapled to telephone poles here advertise the Street Code Academy, a nonprofit organization that helps local kids learn to write computer code. It offers a small door to the economy outside the city limits, where residents have long had to travel for even the most basic services.\n\nThere was no grocery store in East Palo Alto for two decades, a food-desert period that ended in 2009. But those living on the west side, cut off from the rest of the city by Highway 101, still have no nearby place to shop for groceries, school supplies or much else.\n\nNow the east and west, where the majority of its rent-controlled and government-subsidized apartments are located, will be connected by a long-sought bike and pedestrian overpass.\n\nIt is under construction now, long after richer and whiter nearby cities had similar projects built. Groceries, clothes and fast food will soon be within walking distance to westside residents, marooned for years on the side of the highway that features a Ferrari-Maserati dealership.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re losing people, yes, but there will always be poor people here,\u201d Abrica said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t care for the most vulnerable, and the loss continues, there will be an apartheid system.\u201d", "Chinese President Xi Jinping is seen on a live broadcast at the media center during the opening ceremony for the China International Import Expo in Shanghai, Monday, Nov. 5, 2018.

But he offered no response to U.S. and European complaints about technology policy and curbs on investment.\n\nThe China International Import Expo, held at a Shanghai convention center, is part of efforts to develop China-centered trading networks while resisting pressure to roll back industry plans that Washington, Europe, Japan and other governments say violate its market-opening obligations.\n\n\u201cIt is our sincere commitment to open the Chinese market,\u201d Xi said in a speech to a VIP audience that included Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev.\n\nXi promised to cut costs for importers and improve consumer spending power to help boost imports. He made no mention of the standoff with President Donald Trump over Chinese plans for state-led development of technology industries.\n\nBut in an indirect reference to Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica first\u201d policies and threats of import controls, Xi appealed to other governments to \u201cjointly safeguard free trade.\u201d\n\nSome 3,600 companies from 152 countries selling everything from Egyptian dates to German factory machinery are attending the five-day event at the cavernous convention center that bills itself as one of the world\u2019s biggest buildings.\n\nPrime ministers and other senior officials of governments including Egypt, Pakistan and Vietnam also were attending the fair. The United States \u2014 China\u2019s biggest trading partner \u2014 did not send a high-level envoy.\n\nXi\u2019s government is emphasizing the promise of a growing consumer market of 1.4 billion people to help deflect the complaints that it subsidizes fledgling technology suppliers and shields them from competition.\n\nBusiness groups say China still hampers access to industries including finance and logistics. They say regulators are trying to squeeze foreign competitors out of promising fields such as information security.\n\nXi promised steps that might address such complaints if carried out, including easing restrictions on foreign competitors in finance, education, telecoms and health care. He gave no details or a timetable but said the ruling party already was carrying out changes promised over the past year.\n\nBusinesspeople and economists welcomed the promises but said Beijing needs to act promptly to dispel concern about the cooling, state-dominated economy.\n\nThe speech \u201cis at least a tacit acknowledgement that much needs to be done,\u201d said the chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, William Zarit, said in an email. \u201cWe will see if this leads to the timely sweeping reforms needed for a fair and reciprocal bilateral commercial relationship.\u201d\n\nThe ruling Communist Party is trying to restore public confidence after economic growth sank to a post-global crisis low of 6.5 percent over a year earlier in the last quarter. The country\u2019s stock market has sunk 25 percent this year, becoming the world\u2019s worst performer.\n\nXi acknowledged some Chinese industries face \u201cgrowing risks\u201d but said efforts to shore up growth are already paying off.\n\nChina\u2019s $12 trillion-a-year economy is \u201ca sea, not a small pond\u201d and can withstand shocks,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cA storm can overturn a small pond, but not a sea,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter more than 5,000 years of hardship, China is still here. Facing the future, China will always be here.\u201d\n\nChina has cut tariffs and announced other measures this year to boost imports, which rose 15.9 percent in 2017 to $1.8 trillion. But none addresses U.S. complaints that prompted Trump to impose penalty tariffs of up to 25 percent on $250 billion of Chinese imports. Beijing has responded with tariff hikes on $110 billion of American goods.\n\nThe fair lets Beijing show it is \u201cmaking efforts to boost imports,\u201d said Rajiv Biswas, chief Asia economist for IHS Markit. But a deal with Washington \u201cwill require significant measures by authorities to reduce bilateral trade imbalances and to protect U.S. intellectual property rights,\u201d he said.\n\nChinese leaders have rejected pressure to scale back plans such as \u201cMade in China 2025,\u201d which calls for state-led creation of global champions in robotics and other fields that might challenge U.S. industrial leadership.\n\nLast week, Trump and Xi had what China\u2019s foreign ministry called an \u201cextremely positive\u201d phone conversation. They plan to meet during this month\u2019s Group of 20 gathering of major economist in Argentina, but private sector analysts say a breakthrough is unlikely.\n\nAlready the No. 1 market for its Asian neighbors, China is seeking to expand commerce by building ports, railways and other infrastructure across 65 countries from the South Pacific through Asia to Europe and Africa. The Shanghai expo also gives Beijing a chance to repair its image as a positive for global development following complaints that projects it sponsors under its \u201cBelt and Road\u201d initiative leave host countries with too much debt, with too little work goes to local companies.\n\nExhibitors at the event included U.S. automakers and technology suppliers \u2014 Microsoft founder Bill Gates attended \u2014 European pharmaceutical and clothing brands, African tea exporters and Japanese electronics manufacturers.\n\nAt a stand for Nicolas Correa SA, a Spanish factory equipment maker, salesman Carl Che showed off a milling machine the size of a bus that can cost 1-5 million euros ($1.2-6 million). Exhibitors at the event included U.S. automakers and technology suppliers, European pharmaceutical and clothing brands, African tea exporters and Japanese electronics manufacturers.\n\nAt a stand for Nicolas Correa SA, a Spanish maker of factory equipment, salesman Carl Che showed potential customers a milling machine the size of a bus that can cost 1-5 million euros ($1.2-6 million). Che said Chinese manufacturers of wind turbines, aircraft and nuclear power equipment have bought 406 of the machines since 2003 and the company is looking to expand to food, health and other industries.\n\nThe expo is \u201ca good chance to show ourselves to the whole of China,\u201d said Che. \u201cToday, we received five customers who are very interested. It is just a matter of price.\u201d\n\nThe China agent for Metal Shark Boats, a New Orleans-based builder of heavy duty vessels for law enforcement and fire agencies, had two 13-meter-long (40-foot-long) patrol boats sitting in metal cradles.\n\nIt has sold five boats to China\u2019s customs agency and the company is marketing itself to environment and other regulators, said Sherman Ge, chairman of Shanghai-based Breeze Tech.\n\nThe expo also highlights the blurring of lines between Chinese and foreign industry as Chinese companies expand abroad.\n\nExhibitors promoting imports into China included Sweden\u2019s Volvo Cars, a unit of Chinese automaker Geely Holding; General Electric Appliances, part of China\u2019s Haier Group in 2016, and California-based solar supplier MiaSole, part of Beijing-based Hanergy Group.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Katherine Frey/The Washington Post)\n\nIt took facing a franchise with its own healthy share of dysfunction and injury for the Washington Wizards to finally win their second game of the season.\n\nAnd even then, Sunday\u2019s 108-95 victory over the New York Knicks provided only limited reassurance that the worst defensive team in the NBA, at least statistically, is close to correcting the maladies that have the Wizards in the draft lottery mix rather than for one of the top Eastern Conference playoff seeds they fancied themselves heading into the season.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a start,\u201d Wizards Coach Scott Brooks said. \u201cIt was a good win. When you have a losing streak, the games become heavier and heavier.\u201d\n\n[Wizards find their defense against Knicks and lose their losing streak]\n\nWashington (2-7) ended a five-game slide while playing without starting forward Otto Porter Jr., who was inactive with a toe contusion and replaced by Kelly Oubre Jr. Porter missed practice Saturday, was a game-time decision Sunday and remains day-to-day, according to Brooks.\n\nMinus one of their top three-point shooters, the Wizards, with the exception of point guard John Wall, misfired badly from beyond the arc, were outrebounded for the ninth time in as many games and allowed a rebuilding opponent to stay within reach into the fourth quarter in front of an announced crowd of 16,679 at Capital One Arena.\n\nA 16-2 surge after the score was tied at 86 with 9:13 to go allowed the Wizards to exhale before they embarked on yet another road trip, this one for three games, beginning Tuesday. Washington recently had come back from its longest stretch of travel on the season, five games over nine days.\n\n\u201cNo disrespect to the Knicks,\u201d Wizards forward Markief Morris (16 points, six rebounds, five assists) said, \u201cbut they\u2019re a young team trying to find itself. I think we\u2019re supposed to [win].\u201d\n\nWall scored a game-high 26 points with seven assists and made 3 of 6 three-pointers in the first game of the season in which Washington limited an opponent to fewer than 100 points. Beal added 22 but went 1 for 7 from beyond the arc. Other than Wall, the Wizards combined to shoot 3 for 20 on three-pointers.\n\nThe Knicks (3-7) got 18 points and 12 rebounds from Enes Kanter, and four teammates also scored in double digits for a club awaiting the return of Kristaps Porzingis as he continues to recover from a torn ACL suffered in February.\n\nThere is no definitive timetable for when the all-star forward-center will rejoin the Knicks, who shot 42 percent but only 5 for 27 (19 percent) on three-pointers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just glad we got a win,\u201d said center Dwight Howard (10 points, team-high 10 rebounds), playing in his second straight game after he missed the first seven with a lower body injury. \u201cThat\u2019s the main thing. It\u2019s tough one. Knicks have been playing pretty good basketball as of late. We haven\u2019t been as good as we want to.\u201d\n\nWashington had multiple chances to pull away in the third quarter, most notably after consecutive three-pointers from Beal and Wall bumped the lead to 72-60, leading to a Knicks timeout with 6:01 to play.\n\nBut New York, which came in winners of two of its past three, stormed back thanks to significant contributions from Kanter and fellow reserves Trey Burke (13 points) and Allonzo Trier that knotted the score at 84 early in the fourth quarter.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what sparked it, but that\u2019s what we needed,\u201d Beal said of a defensive performance that held the Knicks to three field goals over the final nine minutes. \u201cDefinitely our best defensive game of the year keeping a team under 100 points, playing together.\n\n\u201cGranted fourth quarter they went on a nice little run, but we did a good job of getting stops down the stretch when we needed to.\u201d\n\n[Capital City Go-Go thump to their own beat in debut]\n\nThe Wizards were back on the court two days after another wretched defensive showing during a 134-111 loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder in Washington\u2019s first home game since Oct 20.\n\nThat was the third time this season the Wizards surrendered at least 134 points, matching a franchise record set in 1983-84 for the most games in which an opponent has scored 130 or more. Washington allowed 130 points twice last season.\n\nGlaring defensive deficiencies also led to Washington having permitted 991 points through its first eight games, the most since the 1990-91 Denver Nuggets. That team failed to make the playoffs, finishing with an NBA-worst 20-62 record.\n\nAsked about the difference between the team\u2019s play Sunday night and the past five losses, Beal said, \u201cProbably just the effort. It was put together for a whole 48 minutes for the first time. I think games past, we\u2019d play a good first half or a good second half, or we just play the whole game trying to come back from down such large deficits, so it was good to be on the other side of it.\u201d", "In this Sunday, Nov. 4, 2018 photo released by the North Korean government, Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel, left, raises joined hands with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un from a car upon arrival in Pyongyang, North Korea.

He was met at the airport by Kim, who joined him on the ride into the city past flower-waving and cheering crowds.\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s state media reported the two held talks at the Paekhwawon State Guest House and stressed their shared socialist history and vowed continued solidarity. The official media offered few specifics, but said the talks proceeded in a \u201ccomradely and friendly atmosphere.\u201d\n\nThe meeting with Kim could be seen as a shot across the bow for Washington, which has run into increasing difficulty in its efforts to wrest significant progress from the North on the denuclearization issue.\n\nPyongyang, which has also been quietly cozying up to Moscow recently, has been hardening its rhetoric ahead of a meeting in New York later this week between Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the North\u2019s main negotiator, Kim Yong Chol.\n\nOver the weekend, Pyongyang used its official media to criticize the U.S. for its continued support of sanctions \u2014 a political tool Washington has also used extensively on Cuba and Russia \u2014 and hinted it may resume nuclear development if Washington doesn\u2019t change is tune.\n\nSanctions-busting has been high on Diaz-Canel\u2019s agenda.\n\nWhile in Moscow, Diaz-Canel discussed a nearly $50 million arms deal with Russia and won a similar vow of expanded political, economic and military ties from Putin. The two then issued a joint statement denouncing U.S. \u201cinterference into domestic affairs of sovereign nations.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. economic embargo on Cuba, initially imposed in 1958 and subsequently expanded, has remained in place. Russia faced an array of crippling U.S. and EU sanctions over the annexation of Crimea and its support for separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine.\n\nDiaz-Canel was to leave Pyongyang on Tuesday and visit China, Vietnam and Laos.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Asylum seekers already camping at border crossings worry that how the Trump administration responds to the caravan of some 4,000 Central American migrants and three much smaller ones hundreds of miles behind it could leave them shut out. (Eric Gay, File/Associated Press)\n\nMATAMOROS, Mexico \u2014 Waiting on the southern end of a bridge that leads to the United States, Humberto Alvarez Gonzalez warily follows the progress of the caravan winding through Mexico with the goal of reaching the border.\n\nAlvarez and about two dozen other people are waiting in Matamoros, across the Rio Grande from Brownsville, Texas, because U.S. customs officers say there\u2019s no space to process them. They sleep on cots near the bridge and rely on donors who bring them food and clothing. Some have waited for two weeks.\n\nNow, Alvarez, a 32-year-old from Cuba, is worried that large waves of migrants in a caravan still more than 800 miles away from the border might provoke the U.S. government to reject them altogether.\n\n\u201cOur idea is to enter before the caravan,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are afraid that the group of migrants will reach us and that they will judge us together with them.\u201d\n\nAsylum seekers already camping at border crossings worry that how the Trump administration responds to the caravan of some 4,000 Central American migrants and three much smaller ones hundreds of miles behind it could leave them shut out. President Donald Trump last week threatened to detain asylum seekers in large tents and send as many as 15,000 active-duty soldiers to the border. He\u2019s also spoken of closing the border.\n\nU.S. government officials say the bridges remain open to asylum seekers. But in South Texas, the busiest corridor for unauthorized border crossings, U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers stand at the center of bridges to check documents and stop most asylum seekers.\n\nAnd in San Diego, people at the San Ysidro crossing wait more than a month, and volunteers operate an informal take-a-number system to spare migrants from having to wait in line or sleep out in the open. Inspectors there typically process about 100 claims a day.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not turning people away, it\u2019s asking them to wait,\u201d CBP Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said recently. \u201cWe are taking people in as we have capacity to do so.\u201d\n\nAt the bridge where Alvarez and dozens of others wait, security guards on the Mexican side hold back asylum seekers until U.S. border inspectors tell them how many people they will accept. Some days, five or 10 people are allowed. On other days, the asylum seekers said, no one is.\n\nAt another bridge separating Brownsville and Matamoros, four women and their children slept under a blue tarp on the bridge. The tarp had been left behind by previous asylum seekers. One of the women said she had waited there for two days.\n\nSeeking asylum at a port of entry is legal under U.S. law, as government officials have reaffirmed this year. Trump has proposed banning people crossing illegally between ports of entry from claiming asylum \u2014 something many immigration experts say he can\u2019t do under the law.\n\nThe U.S. fielded nearly 332,000 asylum claims in 2017, nearly double that of two years earlier and the highest of any country in the world, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. And many asylum seekers wait for years to have their claims adjudicated, a delay criticized by administration officials and immigration lawyers alike.\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions ruled in June that fleeing gang or domestic violence would generally not be considered grounds for asylum, a decision that would affect many people\u2019s claims.\n\nJodi Goodwin, an immigration attorney in Harlingen, Texas, said she believes the government was trying to frustrate asylum seekers into giving up.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019re using a lot of ruse and double-speak to try to circumvent the law,\u201d she said.\n\nTwo women and three children were waiting Saturday at the center of the bridge between McAllen, Texas, and Reynosa, Mexico, a day after soldiers had installed concertina wire on the bridge and the riverbank below.\n\nAfter some time, an official from Mexico\u2019s migration bureau came up to the group of five and directed them off the bridge, away from U.S. customs.\n\nAssociated Press journalists followed as the official and then a private security guard led the group back into Mexico and into a migration bureau office. An employee inside the building would not let the AP interview the group, and U.S. border inspectors on the bridge declined to comment.\n\nAt the bridge in Matamoros, Mexico, Alvarez continued to wait with others from all over the world: Honduras, Peru, Venezuela and Cameroon.\n\nThey insisted they will only enter peacefully and lawfully, waiting their turn at the bridge.\n\nJavier Mederos Mendez, a 44-year-old from Havana, said he was fleeing political repression because he disagreed with the ruling Castro family. He said he had flown from Cuba to South America, then crossed through jungles and violence-torn areas of Central America and Mexico to reach the bridge.\n\nHe and others had seen people drown or starve along the way.\n\nAsked what he thought of Trump\u2019s announcements about asylum, Mederos said, \u201cIt would be unfair of me to decide what is good or bad for a country.\u201d\n\nBut, he said, \u201cI will wait as long as necessary until they receive me.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Elliot Spagat in San Diego contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

You\u2019re crazy! You\u2019re loony!\u201d McLaughlin said.\n\nRepublicans in Florida see prosperity all around them. They also see threats.\n\n\u201cRepublicans want strong borders, no crime, no chaos and no caravans. Democrats want open borders, and they want to invite caravan after caravan into our country, which brings crime upon crime,\u201d Trump said in the arena. \u201cA Democrat victory on Election Day would be a bright flashing invitation to traffickers, smugglers, drug dealers and gang members all over the world, come on in.\u201d\n\nRon Gavin, 62, and his wife Lori, 51, of Fort Myers, attended the rally and are solid Trump supporters.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve kind of called it the invasion, that\u2019s pretty much what it is \u2014 an invasion,\u201d Ron said.\n\n\u201cWe should be taking care of our own before we let in any more,\u201d Lori said.\n\nCraig Lougheed, 74, who worked in the insurance business and has been in Southwest Florida for seven years, said of Trump: \u201cHe\u2019s like a miracle worker. He\u2019s making history like no one has ever seen before in America.\u201d\n\nDel Whaley, 69, of Ocala, showed up in his \u201cGod Hates Divorce\u201d T-shirt. He said he likes Trump\u2019s stance on taxes. The Democrats? \u201cThey\u2019re in full support of baby killing, and I think they have a philosophy of controlling people through welfare,\u201d Whaley said.\n\nScott and DeSantis each had a few minutes at the microphone while Trump stood to one side. Scott is not running a strictly red-meat campaign. He spoke of how nice Americans were after Hurricane Michael.\n\n\u201cPeople from all over this country came down here and took care of our citizens,\u201d he said, to polite applause. \u201cThey brought food, water, generators, tarps. They did everything to take care of our citizens. And you know what? They didn\u2019t say, \u2018Oh, what party are you?\u2019 \u201d\n\nDeSantis was more fiery, attacking Gillum repeatedly. When he alluded to a federal corruption probe that has entangled associates of Gillum, the crowd chanted \u201cLock! Him! Up! Lock! Him! Up!\u201d\n\nThis was preaching to the already persuaded. At one point, Trump had asked people to raise their hand if they\u2019ve voted. Thousands of hands shot into the air. A majority of the crowd, probably.\n\n\u201cWow,\u201d Trump said. He repeated the question, as if maybe there had been some confusion. All those hands shot up again.\n\n\u201cThen what the hell am I doing here tonight? Goodbye,\u201d he joked.\n\nVoter unpredictability\n\nThe parties are ideologically organized, and the tribes are strong, but people don\u2019t always vote predictably.\n\nConsider Terry Maroney, 67, a retired sugar cane farm manager, a widower, living in the no-stoplight small town of Palmdale in Glades County, which borders Lake Okeechobee. He can tell you the difference between growing cane in muck and growing it in sand. On paper he\u2019s in the \u201clikely Republican\u201d demographic, but he\u2019s voting Democratic.\n\nHe has supervised immigrant farmworkers and says they work harder than native-born Americans. They\u2019re the first out of the truck to open a gate. He was dismayed when one of the big sugar cane companies got rid of good workers because they lacked papers.\n\nHe notes that some of his neighbors fly Confederate flags.\n\n\u201cIn a town like Palmdale, you still have racism. So when it comes to the governor, there are people who aren\u2019t going to vote for him because he\u2019s black,\u201d he said.\n\nUp the road in Sebring, truck driver Bruce Moore Jr., 39, of St. Petersburg, said he has been trying to rally support among fellow African Americans for a state constitutional amendment on the ballot that would restore voting rights to nonviolent felons who have served their time.\n\n\u201cA large amount of blacks don\u2019t believe in voting. It\u2019s sad,\u201d he said.\n\nNot far away, Barbara Cochlin, 61, who was picking up her Nissan Maxima at a carwash, said, \u201cWe used to vote people, not party, but now the Florida Democratic Party is getting too uppity.\u201d\n\nShe said she thinks the swing-state status of Florida has incited the Democrats to be \u201caggressive.\u201d She would like to see the Republicans answer in kind. \u201cYou gotta find somebody like a WWF wrestler,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need somebody very vulgar.\u201d\n\nUp the road, in Frostproof, an orange-grove town nestled between lakes, Justin Deen, 51, who sells vintage cars, leaned against a 1963 Buick Skylark while his red-nosed pit bull, Hefner, curled on a cool spot on the concrete.\n\nDeen said he doesn\u2019t have any use for career politicians. But he supports Republicans. And there\u2019s no way he would vote for Gillum, he said. \u201cHe wants Trump to be impeached. You think Trump\u2019s gonna want to work with him?\u201d\n\nRallying supporters\n\nSeveral thousand people packed the Ice Palace Film Studios for Friday\u2019s Democratic Party rally. The event began with a joint prayer by a rabbi, a preacher and an imam. The rabbi read the names of the people targeted by the pipe bombs. He then read the names of the two African Americans recently slain in Kentucky by a gunman who allegedly had tried first to get into a black church. And then he read the names of the Jews slain by a gunman Oct. 27 at their synagogue in Pittsburgh.\n\nNext came speeches by numerous Democrats running for office. People murmured as they waited for the big names to get their turn. When Tom Perez, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, took the stage, he howled that the weekend had been canceled \u2014 because everyone had to go get out the vote.\n\nThe volume dropped precipitously when Nelson appeared and delivered his lines as if speaking in someone\u2019s living room. The senator seemed most animated when he mentioned creating new aerospace jobs and said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to Mars!\u201d\n\nGillum came on, finally, as the crowd went wild.\n\n\u201cI want a chance to go to Tallahassee and to take on the NRA\u201d \u2014 cheers from the crowd \u2014 \u201cand let them know that their time of running Tallahassee has come to an end!\u201d Gillum said. \u201cNo parent ought to have to send their child to school worried about whether they will pick them up alive or in a body bag.\u201d\n\nAnd then came Obama, sleeves rolled up, defending his legacy (the economy is going good because Democrats cleaned up the Republican mess), deriding the \u201cfearmongering\u201d and \u201clying\u201d of the Republicans, and saying the election will give Americans a chance to reveal \u201cthe better angels of our nature.\u201d\n\nThe Democrats departed feeling confident.\n\n\u201cWe got it in the bag. No doubt about it,\u201d said Victoria Lewis, 73, referring to the governor\u2019s race. \u201cBecause the other guy doesn\u2019t have a clue.\u201d\n\nBut Florida Democrats notoriously don\u2019t turn out in high numbers for midterms, and nearly three in 10 Florida voters are independents and it\u2019s difficult to know what they\u2019ll do. It\u2019s possible there could be a split outcome, with one party winning the Senate race and the other the governorship.\n\nPolitics can split a household, too. Vern Hollingsworth, 75, of Sebring, knows all about that, he revealed during a brief break from waxing his 2013 Cadillac in the carport of his home in Hammock Mobile Estates.\n\nHe said he\u2019s already voted for the Democratic ticket. But he added, \u201cit didn\u2019t really count because my wife voted for just the opposite of me.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s how it always goes, he said. He\u2019s a D, she\u2019s an R.\n\nSo how do the Hollingsworths resolve their political differences?\n\n\u201cYou never get that resolved,\u201d he said, and then went back to waxing the Cadillac.", "Sen. Claire McCaskill (D), who is in a tough reelection battle against Republican Josh Hawley, has tried to distance herself from liberal activists she calls \u201ccrazy Democrats.\u201d (Scott Olson/Getty Images)\n\nWhen it comes to President Trump, Missouri Republican Senate candidate Josh Hawley gushes with praise, embracing his views on trade, immigration and health care while declaring that Trump \u201chas delivered on the things that this state voted for.\u201d\n\nHis Democratic opponent, Sen. Claire McCaskill, though opposed to the Republican approaches to health care and trade and a critic of Trump\u2019s troubles with the truth, has nevertheless said she, too, would happily work with the president. Moreover, she has distanced herself from strident liberal activists she calls \u201ccrazy Democrats.\u201d\n\nAnd so goes the campaign in a quintessential Senate battleground, the likes of which could determine the majority \u2014 a conservative state that backed Trump in 2016 but where Democrats are angling for a winning formula.\n\nBesides Missouri, similar battles have unfolded in Montana and Tennessee, which were on the president\u2019s weekend campaign schedule, and Indiana, where he will be on Monday.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t had a real good read on how the voters are going to react to the era of Trump,\u201d said Rep. William Lacy Clay (D-Mo.), a McCaskill supporter. \u201cTuesday will be the tale of the tape.\u201d\n\nAlthough many Republicans are pessimistic about holding the House, they are confident in keeping the Senate and possibly adding to their 51-49 majority. The Senate map favors the GOP: Democrats are defending 26 of the 35 seats up this year, including 10 in states Trump carried.\n\nNational Republicans believe they will gain a seat in North Dakota and they view Missouri as their next best pickup opportunity. In 2016, Trump won the largest share of the presidential vote in Missouri \u2014 nearly 57 percent \u2014 since Ronald Reagan\u2019s 1984 landslide win.\n\nMissouri, a state with vast rural areas that lean conservative and a pair of major metropolitan areas that tend to vote Democratic, is a potential bright spot for Trump in the Midwest on what could otherwise be a disappointing election night.\n\nRepublican Senate challengers in Wisconsin, Michigan and Ohio, all states where Trump won, are substantial underdogs. GOP Govs. Scott Walker of Wisconsin and Kim Reynolds of Iowa are fighting for their political lives.\n\nFifty-four percent of likely voters in Missouri said they approved of the job Trump is doing, according to a recent Fox News poll, compared to 43 percent who said they disapproved. Nationally, Trump\u2019s approval rating is much lower.\n\nBut McCaskill, 65, has proven difficult to defeat. She is a veteran politician known for being a crafty campaigner. In 2012, she interfered in the GOP primary to elevate Todd Akin, whom she saw as a weak opponent. Akin went on to say that \u201clegitimate rape\u201d rarely caused pregnancy, stoking controversy and handing McCaskill a second term.\n\nThis time, she is up against a more formidable opponent. Hawley, 38, the state\u2019s attorney general, was recruited by party leaders, groomed by seasoned consultants and is now championed by Trump, who likes to call him a \u201cstar.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president wants to support those candidates that most strongly support his administration\u2019s policies,\u201d said White House political director Bill Stepien.\n\nMcCaskill has attacked Hawley for joining a lawsuit against the Affordable Care Act and its protections for people with preexisting conditions; and for not opposing Trump\u2019s tariffs, which she calls \u201cbrutal\u201d for farmers. She has also seized on a Kansas City Star report about Hawley\u2019s political consultants helping guide his attorney general\u2019s office staff.\n\nThe senator has made the case for a third term by casting herself as an independent figure who will cooperate with either party. \u201cClaire\u2019s not one of those crazy Democrats. She works right in the middle,\u201d a male voice says in one of her radio ads. McCaskill has also used the term \u201ccrazy Democrats\u201d in television interviews.\n\n\u201cJosh Hawley has decided in this campaign that he is going to win or lose by being 100 percent, never wavering from President Trump,\u201d McCaskill said. \u201cI\u2019m running this campaign on, \u2018I\u2019m not here to fight the president, I\u2019m here to fight for you.\u2019 And if that means I agree with the president, great. If not, I\u2019m not afraid.\u201d\n\nMcCaskill\u2019s tactics reflect the broader Democratic strategy in red-state Senate races. \u201cI\u2019m not about party,\u201d declares Sen. Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.) in a recent ad. Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) fires his shotgun at the ACA lawsuit in his own commercial.\n\nDemocrats are wagering that at a moment or turmoil and controversy surrounding the Trump presidency, voters will have an appetite for a moderates who will counterbalance the chaos and have their back on so-called \u201ckitchen table\u201d issues.\n\n\u201cWe have underscored health care, we have been aggressive on our opponents\u2019 character and we\u2019ve held them responsible for ethics,\u201d said J.B. Poersch, the president of Senate Majority PAC, a Democratic group that has spent more than $114 million this cycle.\n\nAfter a rocky start to Hawley\u2019s campaign \u2014 Republicans complained about his fundraising and Democrats aggressively sought to link him to the scandal surrounding then-Gov. Eric Greitens (R) \u2014 he has put himself in a competitive position. Recent public polls have shown a tight race. \u201cThis race is flat tied,\u201d said McCaskill last week.\n\nThe impassioned fight over Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation was a key turning point, strategists said. Hawley, a former clerk for Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., has emphasized his support for Kavanaugh and McCaskill\u2019s opposition to him.\n\nJames Harris, a Missouri-based GOP consultant and adviser to Hawley, said the confirmation battle \u201cnationalized the race\u201d and united Republicans from different parts of the party at a moment when Hawley was on defense over preexisting conditions. Hawley has said he supports protections for people with preexisting conditions, but not through the ACA.\n\nHawley\u2019s first television ad, released in July, was about the Supreme Court. He said he felt the court fight in the fall resonated with independent voters and others without strong party affiliations.\n\n\u201cAbout the time they started to focus on the midterms was exactly when the Democrats were carrying out this terrible smear against Justice Kavanaugh,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think people saw that and they thought, in this state, this is why we voted for Donald Trump to begin with. Because we hate this stuff.\u201d\n\nAt a rally in Columbia, Mo., on Thursday, Trump said McCaskill had been \u201csaying such nice things about me,\u201d but, \u201cshe didn\u2019t even vote for Justice Kavanaugh \u2014 think of that.\u201d\n\nThe crowd booed.\n\nHawley and his allies have also sought to cast McCaskill as soft on immigration and border security, following in Trump\u2019s lead as he has tried to scare voters about the caravan of migrants headed toward the U.S.-Mexico border. McCaskill has rejected their claims about her.\n\nIn other top Senate races, the Republican candidates have similarly wrapped themselves in the Trump banner. Rep. Kevin Cramer, the front-runner in North Dakota, has been one of Trump\u2019s biggest champions. In Tennessee, Rep. Marsha Blackburn has been a vocal Trump advocate. In Nevada, where Hillary Clinton won, Sen. Dean Heller campaigned with the president last month.\n\nAt the Columbia rally, Trump welcomed Hawley up on stage to speak. In brief remarks, Hawley ticked through ways McCaskill had broken with the president. At one point, he even used a word the president is fond of writing in his social media posts.\n\n\u201cSad,\u201d Hawley remarked, shaking his head.\n\nJames Hohmann in Boonville, Mo., contributed to this report.\n\nRead more at PowerPost", "President Trump suggested Sunday that if Democrat Stacey Abrams becomes governor, she would turn Georgia \u201cinto a giant sanctuary city for criminal aliens\u201d and he accused Democrats nationally of inviting illegal immigrants \u201cto destroy our country, basically.\u201d\n\nDemocrats want to \u201cimpose socialism and totally erase America\u2019s borders,\u201d Trump said as he campaigned for Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp in one of the nation\u2019s most closely-watched gubernatorial races.\n\nTrump is stoking fears about illegal immigration among his mostly white supporters in an attempt to increase Republican turnout in the midterm election Tuesday. His rhetoric was especially harsh Sunday, as he vowed to cut foreign aid to Central American nations he said had done nothing to stop a group of migrants from traveling toward the United States.\n\n\u201cHow about that caravan? Do you want to let that caravan just pour in?\u201d Trump asked, as a crowd that appeared be to a few thousand chanted \u201cBuild that wall\u201d and he smiled.\n\nThe group now numbers about 4,000 and is in Mexico, hundreds of miles from the U.S. border.\n\n\u201cLast week, I called up the United States military. We\u2019re not playing games here,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBecause you look at what\u2019s marching up. That\u2019s an invasion.\u201d\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks during a rally for Georgia Republican gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp on Nov. 4 in Macon, Ga. (John Bazemore/AP)\n\nTrump has ordered more than 7,000 active-duty troops to deploy along the border in Arizona, California and Texas ahead of the election.\n\nKemp has run on his close allegiance to Trump, focusing on conservative rural parts of the state and embracing the president\u2019s tough immigration policies and rhetoric.\n\nTrump also said that Abrams would oversee a government seizure of firearms, repeating a claim that some of Kemp\u2019s supporters have made.\n\n\u201cIf Stacey Abrams gets in, your Second Amendment is gone! Gone! Stacey and her friends will get rid of it,\u201d Trump said.\n\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t mind, somebody comes knocking in here, \u2018Please, I\u2019d like to have your guns turned over to the government. Turn over your guns, please give us all guns right now.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe crowd booed loudly.\n\nAbrams favors stricter gun control but told a town hall gathering that \u201cI am not planning to confiscate and ban guns.\u201d\n\nTrump called Abrams radical and extreme and criticized her policies, sometimes inaccurately, but did not repeat his earlier assessment that she is unqualified to be governor.\n\n\u201cI find his assessments to be vapid and shallow,\u201d Abrams said of Trump on Sunday, during an interview on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d \u201cI am the most qualified candidate. I am a business owner. I am a tax attorney who was trained at Yale Law School. I am a civic leader who helped register more than 200,000 Georgians.\u201d\n\nAbrams would be the nation\u2019s first black female governor. The most recent polling shows race is a statistical tie.\n\n\u201cMy opponent has run the most dishonest campaign\u201d in the state\u2019s history, Kemp told the crowd here. \u201cShe\u2019s lying about me to hide her extreme agenda.\u201d\n\nSpeaking before Trump arrived, Kemp cast the contest as a stand against liberals and outsiders energized by the high-profile race.\n\n\u201cThe radical left is pouring millions into Georgia,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey are itching for you to turn Georgia into California,\u201d Kemp said, adding that \u201cwe can build a wall \u2014 a big, red, beautiful wall \u2014 around the state of Georgia to knock that blue wave down.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s approval rating among Georgians was 46 percent in a Marist poll released Oct. 25, while his disapproval rate was 45 percent.\n\nEarlier Sunday, Kemp announced an \u201cinvestigation into the Democratic Party of Georgia\u201d of a \u201cfailed attempt to hack the state\u2019s voter registration system.\u201d\n\nHis announcement contained no details about the alleged \u201ccyber crimes\u201d in which it suggests state Democrats were involved.\n\nDemocrats condemned what they called a political smear.\n\n\u201cBrian Kemp\u2019s scurrilous claims are 100 percent false, and this so-called investigation was unknown to the Democratic Party of Georgia until a campaign operative in Kemp\u2019s official office released a statement this morning,\u201d Rebecca DeHart, executive director of the state Democratic Party, wrote in a statement to reporters.\n\n\u201cThis is yet another example of abuse of power by an unethical Secretary of State.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s appearance follows several days of visits by national figures supporting both sides in one of the nation\u2019s most-watched gubernatorial races. For Republicans, keeping the Georgia statehouse is a test of party power and appeal in a changing state that Democrats argue could become a presidential battleground.\n\nOprah Winfrey was in the state Thursday in support of Abrams. Vice President Pence came the same day to stump for Kemp. Former president Barack Obama campaigned with Abrams on Friday, attempting to increase Democratic turnout with appearances at historically black colleges near Atlanta.\n\nFormer president Jimmy Carter, who also was governor, is backing Abrams and said last week that Kemp should resign as secretary of state.\n\nCarter argued that Kemp\u2019s position as Georgia\u2019s chief elections official undermines public confidence in the vote in a race that is statistically tied. Abrams and Kemp could end up in a runoff election in December if neither receives a majority on Tuesday.\n\nA poll released Thursday by WSB-TV and the Atlanta Journal-Constitution showed a statistically insignificant lead of two-tenths of a percent for Abrams: 46.9 percent vs. 46.7 percent for Kemp. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points.\n\n[Oprah says campaigning for Abrams isn\u2019t a test of 2020 waters]\n\nPreviewing his visit, Trump had told reporters Thursday that although he likes Winfrey personally, \u201cthe woman that she\u2019s supporting is not qualified to be the governor of Georgia, by any stretch of the imagination.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think Brian is going to be a great governor of Georgia. I think he\u2019ll be a fantastic governor. He\u2019s totally qualified,\u201d Trump said at the White House.\n\nAsked why the thinks Abrams is not qualified, Trump provided no specifics.\n\n\u201cTake a look,\u201d he said. \u201cTake a look at her past. Take a look at her history. Take a look at what she wants to do and what she has in mind for the state. That state will be in big, big trouble very quickly. And the people of Georgia don\u2019t want that.\u201d\n\nRepublicans are running scared, Abrams said when asked why Trump would declare her unqualified.\n\nOn CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d Abrams said that Republicans \u201ccan see the same numbers we are seeing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019re getting scared, and I think desperation tends to lead to comments that aren\u2019t necessarily grounded in reality,\u201d she said.\n\nAbrams also responded Sunday to remarks by Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, who said at a Saturday rally for Florida Republican gubernatorial nominee Ron DeSantis that \u201cthis election is so cotton-pickin\u2019 important.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that there is certainly a throwback element to the language that we\u2019re hearing coming out of the Republican Party that is, unfortunately, disparaging to communities,\u201d Abrams said on \u201cState of the Union.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt may be unintentional, but it signals a deeper misinformation about what Andrew Gillum can accomplish, what I can accomplish,\u201d Abrams said.\n\nGillum, a Democrat, would become Florida\u2019s first black governor.\n\nPerdue was among the warm-up speakers for Trump here Sunday, and urged the crowd to rally support for Kemp among friends, including registered Democrats.\n\n\u201cThat woman is not a Democrat,\u201d Perdue said. \u201cShe\u2019s a socialist, and they do not want her.\u201d\n\nWinfrey said her support for Abrams should not be read as a reconsideration of her disavowal of political ambitions.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to run, okay? I\u2019m not trying to test any waters,\u201d she told the crowd in Marietta.\n\nShe praised Abrams as a leader who \u201cwill serve the underserved of the state of Georgia.\u201d\n\nSpeculation that Winfrey might challenge Trump as a Democrat swelled in January, when she delivered a powerful speech at the Golden Globes. Winfrey ruled it out.\n\nAt a separate appearance with Kemp on Thursday morning, Pence said he had \u201ca message for all of Stacey Abrams\u2019s liberal Hollywood friends: This ain\u2019t Hollywood. This is Georgia.\u201d\n\n[Final debate canceled between Georgia gubernatorial candidates]\n\nA final debate between Abrams and Kemp that had been scheduled for Sunday was called off when Kemp withdrew, citing Trump\u2019s visit. Republicans denied that the Trump visit was a way to avoid the debate, noting that Kemp had accepted an alternate time on Monday. Abrams declined to reschedule, citing previous commitments.\n\nDemocrats accuse Kemp and Republican backers outside the state of trying to suppress Democratic voting, particularly among African Americans.\n\nKemp\u2019s office came under intense scrutiny last month, when the Associated Press reported that more than 53,000 voter registration applications \u2014 70 percent of them from African Americans \u2014 had been held up because the identification information was not an \u201cexact match\u201d to other state records, because of discrepancies such as a dropped hyphen in a person\u2019s name.\n\nOn Friday a federal judge ordered the state to immediately stop using the rule, saying it probably violated the voting rights of a large number of people. Less than two weeks ago, in a separate case, a federal judge ordered election officials to stop automatically rejecting absentee ballots after advocates filed suit against a Gwinnett County, which threw out hundreds of ballots because of discrepancies in signature or missing addresses.\n\nSonmez reported from Washington. Avi Selk in Washington and Vanessa Williams in Augusta, Ga., contributed to this report.", "Democratic hopes of clawing back power in state capitals face considerable uncertainty in Tuesday\u2019s midterms, as a number of highly competitive races for governor throw into question the party\u2019s efforts to use states as a check on President Trump.\n\nJust a few weeks ago, Democrats appeared well-positioned to pick up at least a half-dozen governorships while making major gains in state legislative chambers that will draw congressional boundaries after the 2020 Census. Democrats were especially heartened about their chances in Midwestern and Southern states, including Ohio, Iowa, Wisconsin and Florida \u2014 all states that left party activists bitterly disappointed in 2016 after droves of white voters abandoned the party for Trump.\n\nBut in recent days, Democratic enthusiasm has been dampened by the continued closeness of key races, forcing party leaders to recalibrate expectations. The two most high-profile governor\u2019s races, featuring African American Democrats in Florida and Georgia who are seeking historic wins, are among the races going down to the wire.\n\nRepublicans are also mounting strong challenges in several traditionally Democratic states, including Oregon and Connecticut. Democrats are running strong races in some states \u2014 like Pennsylvania, which went narrowly to Trump in 2016 \u2014 with Democratic governors.\n\n\u201cThings I would have expected to break open one way or another just aren\u2019t,\u201d said Jennifer E. Duffy, the senior editor of the Cook Political Report. \u201cYou still have a decent number of undecided voters . . . and, in some ways, the Republican base woke up.\u201d\n\nAfter making steady gains during the Obama presidency, Republicans now hold 33 of the nation\u2019s 50 governorships, just one below their all-time high of 34. Republicans also hold the majority in two-thirds of state legislative chambers.\n\n\n\nStacey Abrams, a Democrat running to be Georgia\u2019s governor, waves at a campaign event in Atlanta in May. She hopes to become the first black woman elected as governor in the United States. (John Bazemore/AP)\n\nIn Tuesday\u2019s election, 36 states will hold a governor\u2019s election, and Republicans will be defending 26 of them. With so many opportunities, Democrats still remain well-positioned to make gains.\n\nBut the precise number of Democratic pickups is being viewed as a crucial test of the party\u2019s message in swing states, especially when it comes to voter concerns about health care and public schools. The gubernatorial races also are being seen as a test of Democratic efforts to rebuild at the local level after they received a surge of volunteers following Trump\u2019s election. Republicans, meanwhile, are hoping the nation\u2019s improving economy overpowers the electorate\u2019s continued anti-incumbency mood.\n\n\u201cPeople are looking for a bit of balance,\u201d said Elisabeth Pearson, executive director of the Democratic Governors Association, which has raised a record $122 million. \u201cThere are different dynamics in each state, but with everything coming out of D.C., and things Trump is saying, it is worrying people, and they want steady leadership.\u201d\n\nDemocrats are especially confident they will defeat Illinois Republican Bruce Rauner, one of the nation\u2019s least-popular governors, and take over the chief executive\u2019s offices in Michigan and New Mexico, which are held by retiring Republicans.\n\nBut whether Democrats can make dramatic gains \u2014 perhaps even reaching parity with Republicans for governorships \u2014 will probably come down to a half-dozen races in states that formed the backbone of Trump\u2019s surprise 2016 victory.\n\nIn Florida, Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, seeking to be the state\u2019s first black chief executive, has narrowly led Republican Ron DeSantis, a former congressman, for much of the fall. But GOP strategists and Florida political observers say the race has tightened, setting the stage for a volatile conclusion to a campaign that has been cluttered with allegations of racism and corruption.\n\nIn Georgia, the race between Democrat Stacey Abrams and Republican Brian Kemp has been deadlocked for weeks, with many observers now predicting neither candidate will get 50 percent of the vote in the multicandidate race. Abrams, seeking to be the first black woman elected as governor of any state, and Kemp would then advance to a Dec. 4 runoff.\n\nDemocratic hopes in the Midwest depend on the return of the blue-collar voter who went for Trump in 2016.\n\nIn Ohio, Democrat Richard Cordray, a former Obama administration official, is running against Republican Mike DeWine for the seat left open by term-\n\nlimited Gov. John Kasich (R).\n\nFormer governor Ted Strickland, a Democrat, said party leaders are cautiously optimistic that the party\u2019s standing in working-class communities has improved.\n\n\u201cA lot of people went for Trump for a variety of reasons \u2014 frustration, resentment, some sexism and racism \u2014 but there is now just a different climate than there was two years ago,\u201d Strickland said. Still, Strickland said he\u2019s \u201csurprised\u201d the governor\u2019s race remains as close as it is.\n\nIn Wisconsin, most polls have shown Democrat Tony Evers with a small lead over Gov. Scott Walker (R), who is vying for a third term. But a poll released Tuesday by Marquette University showed the candidates deadlocked at 47 percent, and Republicans note Walker has a history of outperforming expectations during the final days of a campaign, including surviving a 2012 recall election.\n\nDespite voter anger at the condition of Wisconsin\u2019s public schools and highways, Walker appears to be benefiting from the state\u2019s strong economy, including a 3 percent unemployment rate.\n\n\u201cI think the party and the base are now motivated and not like the malaise of midsummer,\u201d said Thomas Schreibel, a Republican National Committeeman from Wisconsin. \u201cAnd people are realizing it took Governor Walker eight years to turn this state around, and it could quickly turn around the opposite way.\u201d\n\nIn Iowa, Gov. Kim Reynolds (R) is locked in a close race against Democrat Fred Hubbell. The race has become a referendum on Reynolds\u2019s management of the state\u2019s health-care network, including a Republican-led effort to privatize Medicaid.\n\nDavid Anderson, an assistant professor at Iowa State University, said Reynolds\u2019s stance has cost her votes.\n\n\u201cWithout the Democratic wave this year, Kim Reynolds would be doing much, much better, but I think it\u2019s probably going to be enough to bring her down,\u201d Anderson said.\n\nBut Republicans are more confident than they were a few weeks ago. GOP candidates like Walker have sought to neutralize Democratic attacks on health care by insisting they want to preserve protections for those with preexisting conditions \u2014 even though many also support repeal of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cIt took us as a party a little while to get our message down in order to articulate that to voters,\u201d said one GOP strategist closely involved in this year\u2019s gubernatorial races.\n\nOne continuing surprise has been Republican difficulty in heavily red Oklahoma, Kansas and South Dakota.\n\nIn Oklahoma and Kansas, Democratic candidates have made inroads with voters angered by state budget cuts, and the Republican Party\u2019s overall turn to the right in recent years. In South Dakota, the inspiring story of Democrat Billie Sutton \u2014 a former rodeo star who was paralyzed in a 2007 riding accident \u2014 has helped him remain competitive with Republican Rep. Kristi L. Noem.\n\nDemocrats are also reconsidering how many state legislative seats they can win this year. Jessica Post, executive director of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, or DLCC, said the party now expects to win control of a half-dozen chambers, with Iowa, Minnesota, Maine, New Hampshire, New York, Colorado and Maine being top targets. Earlier this year, the DLCC had been predicting Democrats could flip eight to 10 legislatures.\n\nCatherine Vaughan, executive director of Flippable.org, formed after the 2016 election to try to boost Democrats\u2019 chances in local races, said Democratic campaigns are benefiting from \u201ca lot of homegrown grass-roots organizing\u201d this year. But Vaughan said some groups are scaling back expectations because Democratic donors are directing the bulk of their money to congressional candidates.\n\n\u201cA lot of people haven\u2019t put their money with their mouth is,\u201d said Vaughan, whose organization has raised about $2 million this year.\n\nBut Matt Walter, president of the Republican State Leadership Committee, which works to elect GOP state legislators, said Republican nominees at the local level are proving to be surprisingly resilient at crafting an independent identity, despite Democratic attempts to link them to Trump.\n\n\u201cAnd here we sit, a week before the election, and after all that money and all the hype, there are still all of these states where we are highly competitive,\u201d Walter said.", "President Trump and former president Barack Obama headlined dueling rallies Sunday, sparring in unusually personal terms about health care and who deserves credit for the country\u2019s recent economic gains.\n\nThe spectacle of the president and his immediate predecessor lashing out at each other came two days before the midterm election, and 10 years to the day after Obama won the White House in 2008.\n\nIn Macon, Ga., Trump declared that Obama \u201cdid not tell the truth\u201d when he told Americans \u201cYou can keep your doctor, you can keep your plan\u201d under his signature health-care legislation.\n\n\u201cHe said it 28 times, and it wasn\u2019t true,\u201d Trump told the crowd.\n\nObama delivered his own blistering critique of Trump, accusing the president and Republicans of \u201cjust making stuff up\u201d and mocking them for claiming ownership of economic gains that began on his watch.\n\n\u201cThe economy created more jobs in my last 21 months than it has in the 21 months since I left office,\u201d Obama said in Gary, Ind. \u201cSo, when you hear these Republicans bragging about, \u2018Look how good the economy is,\u2019 where do you think that started? Somebody had to clean it up. That\u2019s what a progressive agenda did.\u201d\n\nThe presidential broadsides came as Trump and his allies defended the president\u2019s focus on immigration, the Georgia gubernatorial race was rocked by last-minute accusations of hacking and leaders of both parties voiced cautious optimism about their chances on Tuesday.\n\nAbrams did not address the controversy, sticking to her usual stump speech during a spirited rally in a community center gymnasium in Augusta.\n\nBut Francys Johnson, a minister and candidate for Georgia\u2019s 12th Congressional District, took Kemp to task for his stewardship of the state\u2019s election system. He reminded he crowd of a major data breach that exposes voters\u2019 personal information and Kemp\u2019s dismissal of the notion of Russian hacking in rejecting assistance from the Obama administration.\n\n\u201cThe devil has been busy today, talking about the Democrats hacking the voting rolls. He wasn\u2019t afraid of Russian hacking, but he\u2019s afraid of Democratic hacking,\u201d Johnson said, drawing laughter and applause.\n\nReferring to Kemp\u2019s failed bid for state agricultural secretary in 2006, Johnson said: \u201cMaybe he would do a better job shoveling manure, because he sure can\u2019t run an election.\u201d\n\n\n\nRonna McDaniel, chairman of the Republican National Committee, appears in Indianapolis last month. (Michael Conroy/AP)\n\nA Washington Post-ABC News poll released Sunday showed that 50 percent of registered voters prefer Democratic House candidates, compared with 43 percent for Republicans. Democrats need to gain 23 seats to retake the House and two seats to reclaim a Senate majority.\n\nIn remarks before leaving the White House for Sunday\u2019s rallies, Trump predicted that his campaign-trail efforts had made a difference in \u201cfive or six or seven\u201d of this year\u2019s Senate races. He also dismissed criticism that he has veered away from talking about the economy, telling reporters, \u201cWell, I do focus on the economy, but you people don\u2019t like to cover that.\u201d\n\nObama, who has been active on the campaign trail in the weeks leading up to the midterm election, spoke with a rasp in his voice Sunday as he took aim at Trump, telling the crowd that \u201cthe character of our country is on the ballot\u201d and accusing Republicans of \u201cshamelessly\u201d lying.\n\n\u201cUnlike some people, I don\u2019t just make stuff up when I\u2019m talking,\u201d Obama said at a rally to support Sen. Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.). \u201cI\u2019ve got facts to back me up. I believe in fact-based campaigning. I believe in reality-based governance.\u201d\n\nHammering on a theme that Democratic candidates have made a centerpiece of their efforts to retake control of Congress, he contended that if Republicans \u201cwant to stand up and defend the fact that they tried to take away your health care, they should do so\u201d rather than \u201cpretend they didn\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\nLater, at a rally for Illinois gubernatorial nominee J.B. Pritzker and other candidates in Chicago, he suggested that Republicans were supporting efforts to make it more difficult for people to vote.\n\n\u201cWhy is it that we kind of take for granted, like, one party that specifically institutes programs to prevent people from voting? It\u2019s a very undemocratic idea,\u201d he said.\n\nFormer vice president Joe Biden, who is considering 2020 White House bid, spent the final Sunday before Election Day rallying Democrats as well at a pair of rallies in Pennsylvania, the state where he was born.\n\n\u201cAs you can tell by my voice, I\u2019ve been traveling a lot,\u201d a hoarse Biden said in Harrisburg, telling the crowd that he had campaigned for 63 candidates in 22 states. He prompted cheers when he issued a veiled rebuke of Trump, saying that Democrats choose \u201chope over fear\u201d and \u201cunity over division,\u201d and \u201cmost of all, we choose truth over lies.\u201d\n\nTrump mentioned Obama by name several times during his rally for Georgia Republican gubernatorial nominee Brian Kemp in Macon, the first of two such gatherings the president attended Sunday. At one point, Trump suggested that his own crowds were bigger than those at Obama\u2019s recent events and appeared to voice dissatisfaction with news coverage of the rallies.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll say, \u2018President Trump and former president Obama had wonderful crowds,\u2019 \u201d Trump said of the media.\n\nTrump and Vice President Pence later flew to Chattanooga, Tenn., where they rallied support for Republican Senate nominee Marsha Blackburn. Trump drew raucous applause when he pledged to \u201ckeep criminals and drug dealers the hell out of our country.\u201d\n\nA monthly jobs report Friday showed that hiring and wages grew more than they have in nearly a decade, a boon for Trump and Republicans on the verge of the election. But to the chagrin of some leading members of his party, Trump has responded by de-emphasizing the economy and stoking fears about illegal immigration among his mostly white supporters in an attempt to increase Republican turnout.\n\nLate last week, Trump\u2019s campaign announced that it was spending $1.5 million on a TV ad featuring footage of Luis Bracamontes, an undocumented immigrant who was convicted of killing two sheriff\u2019s deputies in California in 2014.\n\n\u201cThey all say, \u2018Speak about the economy. Speak about the economy,\u2019 \u201d Trump told a crowd in Huntington, W.Va., on Friday night. \u201cWell, we have the greatest economy in the history of our country, but sometimes it\u2019s not as exciting to talk about the economy, right?\u201d\n\nTrump took a particularly harsh line on the issue Sunday as he vowed to cut foreign aid to Central American nations he said had done nothing to stop a group of migrants traveling toward the United States.\n\n\u201cHow about that caravan? Do you want to let that caravan just pour in?\u201d Trump asked in Macon, as the crowd answered with a chant of, \u201cBuild that wall.\u201d\n\nThe group of migrants now numbers about 4,000 and is in Mexico, hundreds of miles from the U.S. border. Trump, who has ordered more than 7,000 active-duty troops to deploy along the Mexican border in Arizona, California and Texas, described the approaching caravan as \u201can invasion.\u201d\n\nRepublican National Committee Chairman Ronna McDaniel defended the president\u2019s ramped-up rhetoric on immigration and race, arguing that it\u2019s possible to focus on several issues at once.\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m with him,\u201d she said in an interview on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d when asked about Trump\u2019s comments on the economy. \u201cHe\u2019s talking about both. . . . He can talk about multiple things at once.\u201d\n\nTrump will make one final campaign-trail foray Monday, when he headlines rallies in Cleveland; Fort Wayne, Ind.; and Cape Girardeau, Mo.\n\nGeorgia\u2019s gubernatorial race took center stage Sunday, as Kemp\u2019s office announced a \u201chacking\u201d investigation of the Georgia Democratic Party and his campaign condemned the \u201ccriminal behavior\u201d he allegedly discovered. Kemp, who as secretary of state oversees Georgia\u2019s elections, did not provide any evidence, and his announcement was criticized by voting rights lawyers as well as Democratic nominee Stacey Abrams (D), who suggested that the investigation was \u201cnothing more than a pathetic attempt to cover up for his failures.\u201d\n\nOn the Sunday morning news shows, leaders of both parties were optimistic about their chances Tuesday.\n\nIn an appearance on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week With George Stephanopoulos,\u201d Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) said he wouldn\u2019t predict how he thinks the election will go, but he called it a \u201csea change\u201d that there is still a \u201cnarrow path to the majority\u201d in the Senate for the Democratic Party.\n\nVan Hollen, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, credited individual candidates with focusing on the issues that matter in their home states.\n\nAnd in a preview of the contentious leadership battle that awaits House Democrats after Election Day, Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio) signaled Sunday that he could run for speaker if the Democrats take control of the House, saying he thinks it would be wise to elevate someone from Ohio who represents a \u201cblue-collar area.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important that we have this discussion and have this conversation,\u201d said Ryan, who challenged Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) for the party\u2019s top spot in 2016. \u201cI think the American people want a change. I think a lot of Democrats want a change. And so we\u2019re going to have that discussion starting on Wednesday, and let\u2019s hope we\u2019re having that conversation about speaker of the House and not leader of the minority party in Congress.\u201d\n\nThe congressman has said for months that he would consider another run against Pelosi. He said Sunday that several candidates will vie for the speaker position if the Democrats win, and that it \u201cwill not be a coronation.\u201d\n\nRep. Steve Scalise (R-La.) said on Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cSunday Morning Futures\u201d that he thinks Republicans will hold on to the House majority, and that Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) should replace Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), who isn\u2019t seeking reelection. That would open up McCarthy\u2019s No. 2 spot, a post Scalise acknowledged he is interested in.\n\nMcCarthy would face a challenge from Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), who announced a bid for speaker earlier this year.\n\nGearan reported from Macon. Dan Lamothe in Washington and Vanessa Williams in Augusta, Ga., contributed to this report.", "The fierce battle for control of Congress and the nation\u2019s governorships has turned toward blatant and overtly racial attacks rarely seen since the civil rights era of the 1960s.\n\nA new robo-call going out to voters in Georgia features a voice impersonating Oprah Winfrey and calling Stacey Abrams, who is running to become the nation\u2019s first black woman elected governor, \u201ca poor man\u2019s Aunt Jemima.\u201d In Florida, the Trump administration\u2019s secretary of agriculture, Sonny Perdue, urged voters not to elect Andrew Gillum, who would be the state\u2019s first black governor, with a colloquialism widely seen as having racial connotations: \u201cThis election is so cotton-pickin\u2019 important.\u201d\n\nSome Republicans suddenly scrambled, following the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting, to distance themselves from Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa). The moves came after King said a far-right Austrian party with historical Nazi ties would be Republican were it in the United States. Other King comments have drawn little criticism.\n\nThe 2016 election confirmed that a potential president could run \u2014 and win \u2014 after stoking racism. Now, in their closing days, the midterms are shaping up as a demonstration of whether the entire Republican Party can succeed by following his lead.\n\nBy running so overtly on racially tinged messages, the GOP is putting that explosive form of politics on the ballot. If Republicans maintain control of the House, the notion of running a campaign built on blunt, race-based attacks on immigrants and minorities will have been validated. A loss, on the other hand, might prompt a number of Republicans to call for a rethinking of the party\u2019s direction \u2014 but that would collide with a sitting president who, if anything, relishes over-the-edge rhetoric.\n\nThe stakes for the party\u2019s future are immense. Republicans now are an overwhelmingly white party, whereas Democrats represent a multiethnic coalition. The problem for Republicans is that the nation is moving swiftly in the direction of Democratic demographics.\n\n\n\nPresident Trump speaks at a rally for Georgia Republican gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp Sunday in Macon. (John Bazemore/AP)\n\n\u201cThe long-term risks are obvious. The country is rapidly becoming more diverse, and appealing to a more diverse electorate requires a much more inclusive message,\u201d said Whit Ayres, a longtime Republican pollster and strategist. \u201cThose who are firmly committed to Donald Trump are not the least bit concerned. But people in the party who are concerned about how Republicans might actually win a majority of the popular vote or win swing states and districts . . . then they\u2019re very concerned.\u201d\n\nKing is perhaps most emblematic of how far out the lines of offensiveness are being drawn. The eight-term congressman has spent most of his career playing on the racial and xenophobic fringes, drawing praise from Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke, blocking efforts to put abolitionist Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill and displaying a Confederate battle flag on his congressional office desk.\n\nHe said in 2013 that most children of undocumented immigrants \u201chave got calves the size of cantaloupes because they\u2019re hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t restore our civilization with somebody else\u2019s babies,\u201d he tweeted in 2017.\n\nKing\u2019s campaign did not return several messages seeking comment.\n\nIt was only recently, after The Washington Post reported that he met with the far-right Austrian party and when he endorsed a white nationalist mayoral candidate in Toronto, that Republicans denounced him. But the denunciations came after the synagogue shootings; beforehand, the remarks had raised little fuss.\n\nRep. Steve Stivers (R-Ohio), who is head of the National Republican Congressional Committee, last week issued a broad condemnation of King, calling his comments \u201ccompletely inappropriate\u201d and saying \u201cwe must stand up against white supremacy and hate in all forms.\u201d The conservative National Review ran a piece headlined, \u201cConservatives Need to Draw the Line at Steve King.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe used to be just simply problematic, prone to saying outrageous things particularly about Latinos and immigration,\u201d said Karl Rove, the veteran Republican strategist. \u201cBut he\u2019s gotten worse over time. Now he\u2019s hanging around with neo-Nazis in Austria and aligning himself with anti-Semitic fringe figures in Canadian politics. His rhetoric has gotten similarly worse.\u201d\n\nAs Rove\u2019s comment implied, the party had not cracked down hard on King\u2019s earlier objectionable statements. Top party leaders for the most part have attempted to portray him as an outlier, rather than as a symbol of a larger problem within the party.\n\nThe president, too, has escaped much criticism, even though he salted his 2016 campaign with racial insults to Mexicans, Muslims and others and has continued in that vein as president. Part of the danger for would-be critics: Alienating Trump by calling out his rhetoric risks losing the support of the voters who overwhelmingly chose him as their party nominee two years ago.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s harder to deal with Trump,\u201d said Craig Robinson, who runs a political blog called the Iowa Republican. \u201cIn some ways, with Trump being president, you would think a guy like Steve King would have more room to operate. You have a president who is out of bounds sometimes. You\u2019d think it\u2019d give King more latitude. But it\u2019s actually the opposite.\u201d\n\nTrump has hardly been cowed by the criticism of King or occasional pleas to tone down his language. As the campaign has barreled toward its final hours, the president expanded his nativist appeals, proudly calling himself a \u201cnationalist\u201d and trying to drive his base with threats about a caravan of Central Americans creeping toward the U.S. border with Mexico.\n\n\u201cBarbed wire used properly can be a beautiful sight,\u201d he said on Saturday afternoon while touting the work of the troops he had ordered to the border.\n\nRepublican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel made the case Sunday that the midterms should focus primarily on the economy, not immigration.\n\n\u201cThe president has not said that he wants it just to be about the caravan,\u201d she said, speaking on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d with George Stephanopoulos. \u201cHe\u2019s saying, \u2018Let\u2019s look at the record, and are you better off than you were two years ago?\u2019 He\u2019s talking about the economy. It\u2019s just not getting the same coverage. The economy should be first and foremost in a lot of people\u2019s minds when they\u2019re going to the polls.\u201d\n\nMcDaniel declined to answer whether she was concerned about a backlash to Trump\u2019s heated rhetoric about immigration, which on Thursday included a suggestion that U.S. troops stationed at the border could open fire on migrants if they threw rocks. He backed off that idea on Friday.\n\nCandidates in the past have tapped obliquely into racial undercurrents during political campaigns. Ronald Reagan talked of \u201cwelfare queens,\u201d and George H.W. Bush played on racial fears with an ad in his 1988 campaign about a black convict, Willie Horton.\n\nBut the attacks are now much more blatant and out in the open, at a level not seen since the 1950s and 1960s, according to Alan Abramowitz, a professor of political science at Emory University.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite extraordinary. It goes beyond criticizing their views,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is using very racially tinged language. It\u2019s very remarkable to hear from a president, and now it\u2019s seeping down to candidates running below the presidential level. And it\u2019s spread beyond the small fringe now.\u201d\n\nThe charges of racism at its most blatant have come in the South, where candidates Abrams and Gillum are attempting to become the first black governors of their states. The president has led the charge against them, calling Gillum \u201cnot equipped\u201d and Abrams \u201cnot qualified\u201d to be governor despite their long experience in government. Gillum is the mayor of Tallahassee, and Abrams is a longtime legislator.\n\n\u201cThere is certainly a throwback element to the language we\u2019re hearing coming out of the Republican Party that is unfortunately disparaging to communities,\u201d Abrams told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on Sunday. \u201cIt may be unintentional, but it signals a deeper misinformation about what Andrew Gillum can accomplish, what I can accomplish.\u201d\n\nThe robo-calls that have gone out in Georgia purport to be from Winfrey, who campaigned last week for Abrams.\n\n\u201cThis is the magical Negro, Oprah Winfrey, asking you to make my fellow Negress, Stacey Abrams, the governor of Georgia,\u201d the message says, according to a copy obtained by WSB-TV in Atlanta. \u201cYears ago the Jews who own the American media saw something in me \u2014 the ability to trick dumb white women into thinking I was like them. And to do, read and think what I told them to.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see that same potential in Stacey Abrams,\u201d the message continues. \u201cWhere others see a poor man\u2019s Aunt Jemima, I see someone white women can be tricked into voting for \u2014 especially the fat ones.\u201d\n\nSimilar calls have gone out in Florida, with a voice mimicking Gillum as jungle sounds and chimpanzee noises can be heard in the background.\n\nOne Republican group \u2014 called Black Americans for the President\u2019s Agenda \u2014 released a radio ad in Arkansas that warned: \u201cWhite Democrats will be lynching black folk again.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrump has made clear that [the nativism and bigotry] gene hasn\u2019t gone away, and Trump\u2019s candidacy and victory marked its liberation from many prior constraints,\u201d said Bill Kristol, a veteran conservative commentator and editor-at-large of the Weekly Standard. \u201cThe Republican establishment has been floundering in its attempts to respond to this new moment.\u201d\n\nIn King\u2019s district in Iowa, his Democratic opponent, J.D. Scholten, said he feels as if he\u2019s been given a gift. He\u2019s raised more than $1 million over the past week, and a district that Trump won by 27 points suddenly seems competitive.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s given us every opportunity to win,\u201d Scholten said of King on Sunday. \u201cI feel almost like he\u2019s trolling me. Like at the end, we\u2019re going to have a beer and he\u2019s going to say, \u2018J.D., I\u2019ve been trying to lose this seat for 14 years, and finally you\u2019ve done it.\u2019 \u201d", "Baltimore Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco speaks at a news conference after an NFL football game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Sunday, Nov. 4, 2018, in Baltimore.

But the damage had been done.\n\nRavens safety Eric Weddle, who had coverage of Smith-Schuster on the play, was asked whether he knew who Dobbs was.\n\n\u201cOf course I knew who he was,\u201d Weddle said. \u201cHe\u2019s their backup quarterback.\u201d\n\nWho hadn\u2019t thrown an NFL pass yet.\n\nWeddle shrugged. \u201cHe\u2019s an NFL quarterback. It was an easy read. We held them to a field goal.\u201d Weddle, normally one of the Ravens\u2019 most forthcoming players, paused before adding, \u201cIt was a big play.\u201d\n\nThe Steelers drove from there to the Baltimore 11 and took 5:49 off the clock, and Chris Boswell kicked a 29-yard field goal with 8:26 left to extend the lead to 10 .\n\n[Week 9 headlines: Rams-Saints, Brady-Rodgers and more]\n\nThe Ravens countered with a field goal, but Roethlisberger effectively snuffed out any further notions of a comeback with a pair of third-down conversions on his next drive, sealing a 23-16 Steelers win.\n\n\u201cThey played a very good game and deserved to win,\u201d Coach John Harbaugh said. \u201cWe\u2019ll try to get healthy and fresh during the bye week and come out swinging the last seven games and try to make the playoffs.\u201d\n\nThat won\u2019t be an easy task after the Ravens dropped to 4-5. It was their third straight loss and fourth in five games. They trail the Steelers (an AFC North-leading 5-2-1) and the Bengals (5-3), who come to Baltimore in two weeks. With a December schedule that includes games at Atlanta and Kansas City and against the Chargers, the road to postseason looks daunting.\n\nThe Ravens are banged up, especially on the offensive line, and drawing a late bye hasn\u2019t helped things. But the pressure is building on Harbaugh, including a pregame NFL Network report that indicated the Ravens could change coaches during the bye.\n\nThat would be surprising; that kind of move in-season has never been the Ravens\u2019 way of doing business. But if the Ravens miss the playoffs for a fourth straight season, Harbaugh is probably gone.\n\nTeam owner Steve Bisciotti admitted in his post-mortem after last season that he thought about firing Harbaugh after the Ravens missed the 2017 playoffs by blowing a late lead in the finale to Cincinnati. He insisted Harbaugh was not under a \u201cpostseason or bust\u201d edict, but with Ozzie Newsome retiring as general manager and Eric DeCosta taking over, another season without playoff football could force a change.\n\nIf the Ravens do miss the playoffs, losses such as this one will haunt Harbaugh. On their second possession, they faced third and five at the Pittsburgh 5. Lamar Jackson, who came into the game often in the first half at quarterback in what amounted to a wildcat offense, flanked left, went in motion and ran to the right corner of the end zone with no Steeler close to him.\n\nQuarterback Joe Flacco missed him, instead throwing through the end zone, with John Brown the only Baltimore receiver near the ball.\n\n\u201cWe were kind of rushing there,\u201d Flacco said afterward. \u201cIt didn\u2019t get off perfect, and [Jackson] is like the last [option] out of five guys out there on the play. Maybe if I\u2019d held on to it a little longer, I would have been able to get it to him.\u201d\n\nFlacco was under pressure for much of the afternoon, shortening his drops to gain more time to get the ball off.\n\nEach team had two sustained drives in the first half. The Steelers got touchdowns, the Ravens two field goals. \u201cThat\u2019s the name of the game right there,\u201d Flacco said. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating when you don\u2019t get touchdowns in the red zone. They did in the first half. We didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nIt was 20-6 after the Steelers drove 75 yards and killed 8:14 on the clock to start the second half, though Boswell missed the extra point. The Ravens answered that score, finally getting in the end zone on a one-yard run from Alex Collins to make it 20-13. Then came an exchange of punts as the third quarter ended, followed by the Steelers taking three penalties in four plays.\n\nThen Roethlisberger took a hit, and Dobbs showed up. And now the Ravens go into the bye banged up physically, mentally and emotionally.\n\n\u201cTough day,\u201d Flacco said, standing by his locker. \u201cTough three weeks.\u201d\n\nFor more by John Feinstein, visit washingtonpost.com/feinstein.", "Central American migrants begin their morning trek facing Pico de Orizaba volcano as part of a thousands-strong caravan hoping to reach the U.S. border, upon departure from Cordoba, Veracruz state, Mexico, Monday, Nov. 5, 2018. A big group of Central Americans pushed on toward Mexico City from a coastal state Monday, planning to exit a part of the country that has long been treacherous for migrants seeking to get to the United States. (Marco Ugarte/Associated Press)\n\nMEXICO CITY \u2014 Thousands of Central American migrants traveling in a caravan arrived in the Mexican capital Monday and began to fill up a sports stadium, still hundreds of miles from their goal of reaching the U.S. a day before midterm elections in which President Donald Trump has made their journey a central campaign issue.\n\nBy afternoon 2,000 or more had arrived at the Jesus Martinez stadium, which has a capacity of about three times that, and eagerly began sifting through donations of clothes, gave themselves sponge baths, lunched on chicken and rice under the shade of tents and picked up thin mattresses to hunker down for the night.\n\nMany went to medical tents to get treatment for blistered and aching feet, illness and other maladies. \u201cSince we got here, we have not stopped,\u201d said Tania Escobar, a nurse with Mexico City\u2019s public health department.\n\nMelvin Figueroa, a 32-year-old from Tegucigalpa, Honduras, was traveling with his pregnant wife and two children, 6 and 8. He brought the 6-year-old girl to the tent because her eyes were irritated and \u201cshe throws up everything she eats.\u201d\n\nSeveral thousand more migrants were trudging along the highway between the city of Puebla and the capital, catching a lift from passing vehicles when possible.\n\nNashieli Ramirez, ombudsman for the city\u2019s human rights commission, said the city was preparing to accommodate as many as 5,000 migrants from the lead caravan and several smaller ones hundreds of miles behind it, for as long as necessary.\n\n\u201cWe have the space in terms of humanitarian help,\u201d Ramirez said.\n\nAs U.S. election day neared, Trump has seized on the caravan and portrayed it as a major threat, even though such caravans have happened regularly over the years and largely passed unnoticed.\n\nHe ordered thousands of troops to the U.S.-Mexico border when the migrants were still hundreds of miles to the south, threatened to detain asylum seekers in tents cities and has insinuated without proof that there are criminals or even terrorists in the group.\n\nIn dozens of interviews since the caravan set out from Honduras more than three weeks ago, migrants have said they are fleeing rampant poverty and violence. Many are families traveling with small children. Some say they left because they were threatened by gang members or had lost relatives to gang violence; others say they hope to work, secure a good education for their children and send money to support loved ones back home.\n\nAlba Zoleida Gonzalez, 48, from Valle, Honduras, said she had walked for five hours and hitched a ride on a tractor-trailer with about 150 people. Her calf muscles were aching, but that was a small price to pay for the chance at a life better than the one back home.\n\n\u201cI looked for work, and nothing,\u201d Gonzalez said, adding that her husband had been robbed and had to hand over everything he made selling crabs so his assailants wouldn\u2019t do worse. \u201cAnd when one does find a little job they kill you for the money,\u201d she said.\n\nArriving in Mexico City, some migrants stopped at the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe, a major pilgrimage site, to thank the Virgin Mary for watching over them during the journey.\n\nMany had struck out ahead of the larger caravan but intended to regroup in the capital. Oscar Ulloa, 20, an accountant from Honduras, said he arrived by bus from Puebla thanks to handouts from Mexicans. He expected the group would assemble and vote in the coming days on their next moves.\n\nThe 178-mile trek (286 kilometers) Monday from the Gulf state of Veracruz to Mexico City was the longest single-day journey for the group of about 4,000 migrants.\n\nBut there were obstacles on this latest stretch.\n\nTruck after truck denied the migrants rides as they trudged along the highway into the relatively colder November temperatures of central highland Mexico.\n\nAt a toll booth near Fortin, Veracruz, Rafael Leyva, an unemployed cobbler from Honduras, stood with a few hundred others for more than 45 minutes without finding a ride.\n\n\u201cPeople help more in Chiapas and Oaxaca,\u201d Leyva said, referring to the southern Mexican states the group had already traversed and where pickup trucks frequently stopped to offer rides.\n\nMigrants converged on tractor trailers, forcing the big rigs to stop so they could climb aboard. Such impromptu hitchhiking is precarious with dozens scrambling onto vehicles at a time.\n\nCesar Rodas, 24, had pushed a friend\u2019s wheelchair for 24 days across three countries. But he couldn\u2019t lift his friend and the chair onto a truck bed crammed with 150 people. Rodas was trying to get Sergio Cazares, a 40-year-old paraplegic from Honduras, to the U.S. for an operation that Cazares hopes will allow him to walk again.\n\nMexico City is more than 600 miles from the nearest U.S. border crossing at McAllen, Texas, and a previous caravan in the spring opted for a much longer route to Tijuana in the far northwest, across from San Diego. That caravan steadily dwindled to only about 200 people by the time it reached the border.\n\nMany said they remain convinced that traveling together is their best hope for reaching the U.S.\n\nYuri Juarez, 42, said he thinks there\u2019s a \u201cvery low\u201d chance he will get asylum in the United States. But he said he had no way to work back home in Villanueva, Guatemala, where he closed his internet cafe after gang members extorted him, robbed his customers and finally stole his computers.\n\nMexico faces the unprecedented situation of having at least three migrant caravans stretched over 300 miles (500 kilometers) of highway in the states of Chiapas, Oaxaca and Veracruz. The largest group has been followed by about 1,000 who crossed over from Guatemala last week and a second group of about the same size that waded over the Suchiate River on Friday.\n\nMexico\u2019s Interior Ministry estimated over the weekend that there are more than 5,000 migrants in total currently moving through Mexico. The ministry said 2,793 migrants have applied for refugee status in Mexico in recent weeks and around 500 have asked for assistance to return to their home countries.\n\nThe presidents of Guatemala and Honduras, which have been under intense pressure from the Trump administration, called Monday for an investigation to identify the organizers of the caravan.\n\nHonduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez said that \u201cthousands\u201d of his countrymen have returned to Honduras. Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales went further, calling for an investigation of people who \u201cpromote or participate\u201d in the caravan, saying they \u201cshould be judged based on international laws.\u201d\n\nMost of the migrants interviewed say they joined the caravan spontaneously to stay safe, and many were already on the road when it caught up to them. Activist groups that have been trying to help organize things appear to have emerged only after it formed and began moving north.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Amy Guthrie in Mexico City contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.
