["Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the country\u2019s de facto ruler, has been especially ruthless in his pursuit of dissidents abroad, analysts say, continuing the country\u2019s long history of abductions. (Nicolas Asfouri/Pool/Getty Images)\n\nFaisal al Jarba fled his native Saudi Arabia late last year as the danger drew near \u2014 after his patron, a powerful Saudi prince, was arrested and after a friend died in suspicious circumstances while in government custody.\n\nJarba, a leading sheikh in a large tribe, traveled to the Jordanian capital, Amman, joining relatives there. But that was not nearly far enough. Jordanian security officers surrounded his house one evening in early June and took him away for questioning, assuring his family he would be back soon.\n\nWithin days, however, he was driven to the border with Saudi Arabia and handed over to the Saudi authorities, according to two people familiar with the details of Jarba\u2019s forced repatriation, which has not previously been reported. There have been no charges filed against Jarba, 45, and in the five months since he was captured, his family has received no proof that he is still alive, the people said.\n\nThe killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul last month by a team of Saudi agents dispatched from Riyadh has prompted fresh scrutiny of the kingdom\u2019s pursuit of Saudi nationals abroad, from ordinary dissidents to defectors from the tight ranks of the royal family.\n\nThe effort to silence Saudi critics abroad stretches back decades and over the tenure of several monarchs. But Crown Prince \u00adMohammed bin Salman, the kingdom\u2019s de facto ruler, has pursued the practice with an especially ruthless zeal since gaining his position last year, analysts said, even making the return of dissenters abroad a formal policy of the state, according to a Saudi official, who insisted such returns were to be negotiated rather than coerced.\n\nTo repatriate its critics, the Saudi government has tried to lure them back or enlisted friendly regional governments to arrest them or even carried out brazen kidnappings in Europe.\n\nSaudi nationals have vanished from hotel rooms, been snatched from cars or had planes they were flying on diverted. One Saudi dissident prince said in a court filing that he was injected in the neck and spirited away on a private jet from Geneva to Saudi Arabia. Years later, after he managed to leave the kingdom, he disappeared again and has not been heard from since.\n\n\u201cWe know they can kill you; they can destroy your family or use them against you,\u201d said one Saudi women\u2019s rights activist who applied for political asylum in the United States last year. \u201cIt\u2019s always been like this,\u201d she said, adding that Mohammed\u2019s aggressive pursuit of critics had further rattled an already paranoid community of Saudi expatriates.\n\nA Saudi government media office did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment on the abductions.\n\nJarba was not a dissident, but he may have been wanted because of his association with a branch of the royal family that had fallen out of favor with the Saudi leadership, according to the two people familiar with the circumstances of his capture.\n\nHe was a longtime friend and confidant of Prince Turki bin Abdullah, a son of the late King Abdullah. Turki was arrested last November as Saudi authorities detained hundreds of people, including royal family members, business executives and government officials, in what was billed as an anti-corruption operation.\n\nAlthough Jarba\u2019s friends and relatives have had no contact with him, they have been able to piece together some details of his journey after he was taken into custody in the upscale Abdoun neighborhood in Amman. Following his arrest, Jarba was briefly held in the Saudi Embassy in Amman before being escorted to the border. Once in Saudi Arabia, he spent several weeks in Jiddah, which serves as the government\u2019s capital during the summer months. At some point, he was taken to Turki\u2019s house and asked to open secured vaults inside. There were conflicting accounts about whether Jarba was able to do so.\n\nJarba had assumed he would be safe in Amman, the two people said, in part because he was a sheikh in a large tribe, the Shammar, that had strong relations with the Jordanian monarchy.\n\nA spokeswoman for Jordan\u2019s government did not immediately reply to a request for comment on Jarba\u2019s case.\n\nBut Jordanian officials would later tell Jarba\u2019s family that they had been powerless to stop his abduction, according to one of the people briefed on Jarba\u2019s case.\n\n\u201cThis is bigger than us,\u201d the Jordanian officials reportedly said.\n\nThe first reported case of state-sponsored abduction by Saudi Arabia came on Dec. 22, 1979, when the country\u2019s first major opposition figure, Nasser al-Saeed, disappeared from Beirut. He had fled the country after spending time in prison for organizing workers\u2019 strikes and revolts. He continued his criticism while in exile and praised the 1979 capture of the Grand Mosque in Mecca by militants as a popular uprising.\n\nAfter he vanished, Saudi Arabia, ruled by King Khalid bin Abdulaziz at the time, said that reports that Saeed had been abducted and returned to Saudi Arabia by private jet were unfounded. It described Saeed as \u201cinsignificant.\u201d\n\nWhile many who vanish are not heard from again, one victim, Prince Sultan bin Turki bin Abdul\u00adaziz, a grandson of Saudi Arabia\u2019s founder, was able to make his kidnapping public, lodging a criminal case against senior Saudi officials in a Geneva court in 2014.\n\nThe complaint laid out details of an audacious abduction in 2003, during the reign of King Fahd, and named the king\u2019s son, Abdulaziz bin Fahd, and the Minister of Islamic Affairs, Saleh bin Abdulaziz Al-Sheikh, as participants in the plot.\n\nSultan, whom friends describe as a larger-than-life character \u2014 the kind of man who would order strawberry pie in the middle of the night \u2014 had been in Geneva for medical treatment. While abroad, he had been publicly critical of the kingdom, calling for economic reform and highlighting human rights issues.\n\n\u201cHe was warned to stop and told to come back and everything would be fine,\u201d said Clyde Bergstresser, a lawyer based in Boston who was retained by the prince. But Sultan refused to return, so the king\u2019s son and the minister were sent to persuade him.\n\nSultan was invited to a residence of King Fahd on the outskirts of Geneva, the prince later recalled in interviews with Arabic satellite television channels.\n\nHe arrived with his German security guards, who later gave evidence that they watched Sultan speaking with a cousin at the swimming pool, before the two men walked into the library without the guards. A short time later, five masked men arrived.\n\n\u201cHe was thrown to the floor and injected with an anesthetic in his neck and intubated,\u201d Bergstresser said.\n\nSultan\u2019s security guards were told he had decided to go back to the kingdom voluntarily.\n\nAfter seven years, during which Sultan said he was held largely under house arrest, prison or in hospital, he was allowed to leave Saudi Arabia after becoming gravely ill with a respiratory disease. He flew to Boston for medical treatment and later lodged his legal case.\n\nHowever, on Jan. 31, 2016, he made the mistake of boarding a Saudi plane, organized by the embassy in Paris, after his father invited him to visit Cairo.\n\nMonitors on the aircraft that showed the plane\u2019s route to Cairo suddenly went dark, according to Bergstresser. And the plane landed in Riyadh, the Saudi capital. \u201cHe was forcibly taken off the plane, yelling and screaming. I\u2019ve not heard from him since,\u201d Bergstresser said. He added that members of the prince\u2019s entourage were held for several days and then released.\n\nAround the same time, two other princes based in Europe disappeared. The cases were first reported by the BBC last year.\n\nPrince Turki bin Bandar, who was known for his salacious tirades against the Saudi royal family, including accusations of murder, disappeared in 2015 after he had fled Saudi Arabia following a land dispute and taken up residence.\n\nAnother minor royal, Saud bin Saif al-Nasr, also vanished after he urged reforms in the kingdom and publicly endorsed a letter from an anonymous Saudi royal widely circulated in 2015 calling for regime change. He was persuaded to board a private plane to Italy for what he thought was a business trip but has not been heard from since, the BBC reported.\n\nIn an interview with the Russian news website Sputnik last year, Prince Turki al Faisal, a senior royal who heads the King Faisal Center for Research and Islamic Studies, dismissed the cases of the \u201cso-called princes,\u201d saying there were Interpol notices issued for their arrests.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t like to publicize these things because we consider them our domestic affair,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course, there were people who worked to bring them back. They are here; they didn\u2019t disappear. They are seeing their families.\u201d\n\nThe government of Morocco recently said it had extradited Prince Turki bin Bandar to Saudi Arabia to comply with an Interpol warrant.\n\nBut in a statement, Interpol said that it had not issued a notice of any kind for him or Princes Saud and Sultan.\n\nLike Khashoggi, who lived in Virginia, many self-exiled dissidents flee as far as they can from the Middle East, fearing that Saudi Arabia\u2019s allies could extradite them.\n\nIn an interview with The Washington Post several months before his death, Khashoggi discussed the case of Loujain al-Hathloul, a Saudi women\u2019s rights activist who was stopped in March while driving in Abu Dhabi, where she had been studying, and subsequently returned to Saudi Arabia and told to stop posting on social media. A few months later, she was arrested, imprisoned and branded as a traitor in the state-run media.\n\nAs Hathloul was accosted in Abu Dhabi, her husband, Fahad Albutairi, a stand-up comedian, was kidnapped from his hotel room in Jordan and returned to Saudi Arabia, according to two people with knowledge of the incident.\n\n\u201cIt is intimidation,\u201d Khashoggi said. \u201cTeaching these people a lesson, making people fearful.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nSecret recordings give insight into Saudi attempt to silence critics\n\nCrown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is \u2018chief of the tribe\u2019 in a cowed House of Saud\n\nIn death, Saudi writer\u2019s mild calls for reform grew into a defiant shout\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "\n\nPittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto in his Pittsburgh City Hall office on Friday, still at the beginning of what he sees as a \u201cmarathon\u201d recovery from the mass shooting at a city synagogue. (Salwan Georges/The Washington Post)\n\nMayor Bill Peduto had told his team not to call on Saturday morning unless it was urgent. He was planning to sleep in, a rarity, which meant certain protocols applied, including that he would answer his phone only if it rang twice.\n\nWhen the first call came around 10 a.m., Peduto was \u00adcocooned under his blanket and chose to ignore it. When the second call came moments later, the conversation with his chief of staff, Dan Gilman, was swift and matter-of-fact: \u201cThere\u2019s been a shooting at Tree of Life, there are multiple people shot, including police.\u201d \u201cCan you pick me up?\u201d Peduto asked. Gilman replied, \u201cI\u2019m already on my way.\u201d\n\nFive blocks from his home, the deadliest attack on Jews in the United States was still unfolding. Rain was pouring down on his city. His public safety director was out of town. His constituents, people he knew well \u2014 including some inside the synagogue \u2014 were about to begin an all-too-common brand of American suffering. As he stood under a tree shielding himself, hoping to stay dry, chaos built around him.\n\nHe tried to stay calm for himself, for Pittsburgh.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s SWAT teams running past us in full body armor, police sirens going off in every direction, cars flying to get there, firefighters already blocking down the streets,\u201d Peduto recalled.\n\nHe began thinking about evil and how this wasn\u2019t just mass murder, but mass murder of the elderly: Nine of the victims were 65 or older.\n\n\u201cIt was mass murder that preyed on the elderly for the way they pray at that place they call sanctuary . . . in what should be the most secure place that they have in their life,\u201d Peduto said. \u201cAnd it took what we were dealing with to a whole different level of evil.\u201d\n\nBefore the true toll of that evil was known, before bomb squads had secured the building, before the heart-wrenching condolence calls, before the crying, before the string of funerals, before his city was forced into a near-constant state of mourning, Peduto\u2019s phone rang again.\n\nIt was President Trump.\n\n'I love my city'\n\nThe three-minute phone call with the president jarred Peduto, 54, the popular second-term Democratic mayor of the Steel City, just as he was trying to get his head around what was happening. After offering thoughts and prayers \u2014 and pledging anything Peduto needed, including a direct line to the White House \u2014 Trump veered directly into policy, Peduto recalled. The president, Peduto said, insisted on discussing harsher death penalty legislation as a way to prevent such atrocities. Peduto was stunned into silence.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m literally standing two blocks from 11 bodies right now. Really?\u201d Peduto said, noting that he was numb and believed that talking about the death penalty wasn\u2019t \u201cgoing to bring them back or deter what had just happened. . . . I ended the conversation pretty quickly after that.\u201d\n\nWhite House spokesmen did not respond to requests for comment about Trump\u2019s call to Peduto. The president said after the shooting that armed guards might have been able to stop the shooter and prevent the massacre, and he said at a campaign rally hours after the shooting that \u201cwe have to bring back the death penalty\u201d for those who kill innocent people. (Pennsylvania last executed an inmate in 1999, and in 2015 Gov. Tom Wolf (D) announced a suspension of the death penalty.)\n\nThe call between Trump and Peduto portended what would become one of the most challenging weeks a mayor can envision, in which Peduto was thrust into a national policy debate and ultimately a string of public clashes with the president \u2014 including urging Trump to stay away from the city until the community could bury its dead. Against Peduto\u2019s wishes, Trump spent a few hours in Pittsburgh on Oct. 30 amid a week of funerals to share his condolences. The visit drew peaceful public protests and Peduto\u2019s ire.\n\n\u201cIt could have been avoided,\u201d Peduto said. \u201cHe could have chosen to go to the Holocaust museum and lay a wreath with his wife. Or put together a fund in order to memorialize the 11 people whose lives were lost for perpetuity, in the museum.\u201d\n\nTree of Life Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, who welcomed Trump\u2019s visit, said in a televised interview that he found the president to be \u201cvery warm, very consoling\u201d and was \u201cpleasantly surprised by a warm and personal side to the president that I don\u2019t think America has ever seen.\u201d\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters Wednesday that Trump found the afternoon in Pittsburgh to be \u201cvery humbling\u201d and \u201cvery sad.\u201d\n\nPeduto said Trump\u2019s visit angered him not just because it flouted the wishes of families who asked him not to be there but because it stretched the city\u2019s police, forcing him to break one of his first promises to the Jewish community after the attack: that they would have all the security they needed at their schools and houses of worship.\n\n\u201cI was at three Jewish schools and I talked to kids as young as first grade, and I had at least three or four police officers with me to introduce themselves, and our goal was very simple: \u2018You\u2019re going to see police officers outside your school this next week. We want you to know that they\u2019re here to protect you,\u2019 \u201d Peduto said on the day of Trump\u2019s visit. \u201cI don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll be able to have officers at those three schools, and if we do, we\u2019ll have one.\u201d\n\n\n\nAn Israeli flag and list of victims\u2019 names are outside the mayor\u2019s office. (Salwan Georges/The Washington Post)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the first time Peduto had taken on Trump. Last year, after the United States pulled out of the Paris climate agreement, Peduto pushed back against the president\u2019s assertion that he \u201cwas elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs the Mayor of Pittsburgh, I can assure you that we will follow the guidelines of the Paris agreement for our people, our economy & future,\u201d Peduto tweeted in response.\n\n[Pittsburgh mayor says armed guards are not the solution after shooting]\n\nWhile Peduto was on a national stage for the past week, his attention has been on Pittsburgh. Peduto knows that Pittsburgh City Hall isn\u2019t necessarily the best position for taking on gun control or to combat hate speech across the land. Would he seek higher office when his term ends in 2021?\n\n\u201cNot at all,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact, maybe even the opposite. I love my job. . . . This is the only political job other than being a council member that I have sought or that I will seek. I want to work for the city of Pittsburgh. I love my city.\u201d\n\nIn a series of interviews during the past week as he tended to his grieving city, Peduto said he was trying his hardest to be the leader the Jewish community here needed. Genial, in tortoiseshell glasses and a bushy white beard, Peduto also acknowledges he became an unlikely face of the Trump resistance days before the midterms. While the president spoke about armed guards at places of worship and the death penalty as a deterrent, Peduto spoke about access to firearms and railed against the toxic political discourse and apparent anti-Semitism behind the synagogue attack.\n\nBut he said he wanted to steer everyone\u2019s focus to the people of Pittsburgh, to a path toward healing.\n\n\u201cThe advice I got from Libby Schaaf, the mayor of [Oakland, Calif.] who went through a similar tragedy, was have a plan and make it clear and concise and make it transparent,\u201d he said last week. \u201cI\u2019ve been very, very clear since Saturday night that our mission this week is to first and foremost help the families of the victims to get through this week, to get through the funeral process for each and every one of them and focus on their needs.\u201d\n\nThose needs have weighed heavily on Peduto, an Italian Catholic mayor who prides himself as an \u201cadopted\u201d member of the Jewish community here. He was the first non-Jewish council member to represent the 8th District, which includes the synagogue\u2019s neighborhood of Squirrel Hill, since the 1980s, and he is a resident of the area, living less than a mile from Tree of Life.\n\n\u201cThis is where I chose to live,\u201d Peduto said. \u201cI would consider some of the folks to be some of my longest friends, and I\u2019ve had those friendships for 25 years . . . well prior to ever running for office.\u201d\n\nPeduto, like many in Squirrel Hill, has many personal connections to the victims and families affected by the massacre. That meant he was forced to play rabbi to some of his own friends, notifying them that their loved ones could be among the dead. One such person was Michele Rosenthal, who knew her two brothers had been at the synagogue, but on the morning of the attack wasn\u2019t sure whether David and Cecil had made it out alive.\n\n\u201cShe came up and she was trying to find out about both her brothers,\u201d Peduto said with a sigh, his eyes fixed on the floor of his City Hall office. At that point, he had heard secondhand that one brother was dead, but he wasn\u2019t sure, and he didn\u2019t want to pass on a rumor. \u201cSo I hugged her and told her any information we have, she\u2019s going to have.\u201d\n\nIn the minutes after that conversation, he quietly walked up to Rosenthal\u2019s husband, a former colleague and Pittsburgh public safety official, and told him to prepare for the worst. Both David and Cecil, it turned out, had been killed.\n\n\n\nPeduto attends a memorial service in front of Tree of Life synagogue on Oct. 29. (Salwan Georges/The Washington Post)\n\n'I had this fear'\n\nThe personal and professional blurred for Peduto during the past week, as he wrestled with how to shepherd the Jewish community and the city through its darkest episode \u2014 and how to get himself through it emotionally. In the first two days after the attack, he slept for three hours and ate little more than a plate of cold pizza and green beans served by his neighbors as he drifted through a haze of funerals, family visitations and public events.\n\nHe said that one of the most difficult moments was waking up and feeling unsafe in his own home.\n\n\u201cI was in my house, and I was scared. I had this fear,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a very strong sense of insecurity. I didn\u2019t know if this was the first domino to fall. I didn\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nAnother trying moment was when that fear gave way to solitude: Peduto, who is single and lives alone, compared his need to be around people with how some traumatized New Yorkers felt after 9/11. \u201cI could have gone home and just taken a few minutes to do my laundry or to take two hours to rest, but I couldn\u2019t go home,\u201d he said shortly after the funeral of the Rosenthal brothers. \u201cI just couldn\u2019t sit in my house by myself.\u201d\n\nSo he tried to be everywhere and with everyone. As he went from funeral to funeral to funeral, he arrived early at a synagogue to spend time with mourners, holding their hands, avuncularly hugging them and giving words of comfort.\n\n\u201cAnybody who I know is a member of the Jewish community, I reach out and grab their hands and I\u2019ll look them in the eye and I\u2019ll say, \u2018Are you okay?\u2019 There is deep sorrow,\u201d Peduto said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how long it will take to dissipate.\u201d\n\n\n\nPeduto, right, holds hands with Rabbi Jonathan Perlman, who survived the shooting, at Rodman Street Missionary Baptist Church during a service for the victims on Oct. 31. (Salwan Georges/The Washington Post)\n\nPeduto speaks with zeal about the role Pittsburghers have played in helping the city through these moments. When he visited Cappy\u2019s Cafe, a local coffeehouse and bar where his presence is well-known, everyone gave him a hug.\n\n\u201cAnd then, as people were passing by the window, they would just reach out and put their hand on the window. And I got back to my house. I was in a completely different place,\u201d he said. \u201cI have this peace of mind and inner peace right now that is helping me to get that message out.\u201d\n\nHe also said God had been helping him find that peace. He read off his phone a text that he sent his brother Guy shortly after the attack: \u201cI know it sounds weird but I believe that there is a greater voice that is speaking through me. I can\u2019t explain this. And you know how skeptical I am.\u201d His brother texted in response: \u201cDefinitely the divine voice has been guiding you God and Dave are with you. I believe it.\u201d\n\nDave is a reference to Peduto\u2019s beloved older brother, who died unexpectedly of a heart attack two years ago, at age 62. His death has never stopped feeling raw, but Peduto said his presence provided comfort during the past week, as if David were speaking through him.\n\n\u201cI was raised to be religious and I have stayed spiritual,\u201d Peduto said, before joking: \u201cThe bishop may say I better get to church soon.\u201d\n\n\n\nPeduto speaks during a promotion ceremony for emergency medical services personnel at Pittsburgh City Hall on Friday. (Salwan Georges/The Washington Post)\n\nAbove all it was Peduto\u2019s clashes with Trump that helped focus his mind last week, he said, crystallizing his commitment to the families affected by the massacre.\n\n\u201cSomebody asked me, \u2018If you had the choice to do it over again, would you have been with the president?\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cMy answer was, if I had the chance to do it a hundred times, a hundred times I would have been with the families and with my officers.\u201d\n\nNor is he afraid to link the president\u2019s rhetoric to the attack itself.\n\n\u201cThis obviously was somebody whose decision to kill Jewish people was based on what he was reading, with news of migrants who are trying to escape the hell they are in and potentially on their way to the United States. And somehow that story has become butchered into a story of an invading army and then that story being manipulated that it\u2019s the Jews that are doing it and they\u2019re financing it,\u201d Peduto said. \u201cThen this guy wakes up on a Saturday morning armed to the gills with bullets and guns to kill as many Jewish people as he possibly can.\u201d\n\nPeduto said he knows nothing at all about the suspect\u2019s past or the immediate circumstances that led to the attack \u2014 noting only that the man appeared to be sufficiently sophisticated to have covered up his tracks online.\n\n\u201cHe knew what he was doing. He was pretty savvy with software. He knew ways to hide information,\u201d Peduto said. Asked whether that implied the suspect had long been plotting an attack, he said: \u201cYeah \u2014 or very paranoid that what he was doing would one day lead to it.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the most difficult day for Peduto, following the initial shock of the massacre, was Tuesday, the day of Trump\u2019s visit, in part because it was Peduto\u2019s 54th birthday. On little sleep and in crisis mode, Peduto said his mother forced him to stop by for a late-night piece of cake with her and his siblings.\n\nFor him, the sweet moment amid the suffering was symbolic of the next phase of the city\u2019s recovery \u2014 a process he says will be an \u201carc\u201d and a \u201cmarathon.\u201d Peduto is fully aware that life will not quickly return to normal for Pittsburgh.\n\n\u201cIt is going to be a long haul, and this doesn\u2019t just go away. It stays there,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will forever change your city.\u201d", "Columnist\n\nLet\u2019s use this year\u2019s elections to insist that there is still a \u201cwe\u201d in our country. It is a \u201cwe\u201d that crosses the lines of race and gender, country of origin and religion. \u201cWe\u201d is the very first word of our Constitution. Declaring that it is still alive is essential to keeping our democratic republic.\n\nAs a nation, we are not as divided as we seem to be. And we do not have to be as divided as we are. Paradoxically, the best way to begin bringing us back together is to divide government in Washington by giving Democrats control of the House of Representatives and (admittedly a longer shot) the Senate.\n\nAn avalanche against President Trump and his party would be a shout from Americans who have had it with an approach to politics that depends for its success upon misdirection, division, hatred and fear.\n\nThe best indication that we are closer to one other than mounds of data to the contrary might suggest is the desperate nature of Trump\u2019s demagogic campaigning in the twilight of this bitter struggle. Why has he invented a border crisis and unpatriotically deployed our military for purely partisan purposes? Because he has had to conjure anxieties most Americans are not feeling.\n\nDay after day, he has ratcheted up his rhetoric and told lie after lie because nothing he has done in office has brought the country to his side. His best approval ratings have consistently shown that a majority is against him. His worst approval ratings show that majority to be overwhelming.\n\nEven among his supporters, many know there is something badly defective about his approach to leadership. A Public Religion Research Institute poll released last week found that 69 percent of Americans see Trump as having damaged the dignity of the presidency. The same proportion said they would like it if his speech and behavior were more consistent with the conduct of other presidents. On that question, 57 percent of Republicans agreed.\n\nFurther evidence that we are more united than we imagine is the extent to which conservative Republicans lack the courage of their convictions. They are not even trying to make a case for their worldview because they know that most of us reject right-wing positions on taxes, health care and regulation.\n\nRepublicans know they have failed to convince Americans that Obamacare should be repealed. So they falsely pretend that they would protect the insurance coverage of those with preexisting conditions.\n\nTheir one major legislative achievement, a huge corporate tax cut, has gained no traction with voters outside the boardroom. So the GOP is hoping that the president\u2019s incendiary rhetoric encourages everyone to overlook how its greatest exertions have left those whom Trump called the \u201cforgotten\u201d feeling as forgotten as ever.\n\nWhat has long been true is still true: We have a healthy mistrust of government but still count on it to make our lives better. We know that in many spheres, the market alone will not guard us from hazard. We also know it won\u2019t invest in the public goods essential for all of us to thrive.\n\nNotice what is happening in the key industrial states that swung Trump\u2019s way in 2016. Democratic Sens. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Robert P. Casey Jr. of Pennsylvania, Debbie Stabenow of Michigan and Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin appear on their way to robust victories.\n\nAs for governorships, Democrats will hold Pennsylvania\u2019s and have decent shots in Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin, which are held by the GOP. Many of the blue-collar voters who backed Trump two years ago in protest were never taken by his extreme selfishness or his relentless immigrant-baiting. They are poised to send him a message.\n\nAnd could there be any better response to Trump\u2019s racial demagoguery than electing two new African American governors, Stacey Abrams in Georgia and Andrew Gillum in Florida? Both are Democratic standouts this year, and the fact that their contests are so close tells us that Trumpism is not our future.\n\nThe signal here, amid all the noise Trump is generating, is that Americans yearn for a very different style of politics. But their plea will get through loud and clear only if they vote in large numbers to say we will not allow Trump and his party to build virtual political walls in the heart of our nation, separating us by our backgrounds, our races or our faith.\n\nThrough our ballots, we can send forth a forceful and joyous \u201cwe.\u201d It\u2019s our right.

Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York City who is considering a 2020 presidential campaign, took another step closer to that possibility Sunday with a $5 million national advertising effort that encourages voters to support Democrats in Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections \u2014 and offers Bloomberg\u2019s centrist politics as a counter to President Trump.\n\nBloomberg\u2019s two-minute television ad, which features him speaking directly to the camera and standing before an American flag, first aired Sunday during CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d It will air again Monday during the evening news programs on broadcast networks and on MSNBC and CNN.\n\nBloomberg, 76, portrays himself in the spot as a steady and seasoned Washington outsider (hint: presidential) who is appalled by Trump\u2019s conduct and agenda and alarmed by episodes of political violence and Trump\u2019s mounting attacks on the caravan of Central American migrants.\n\nAs soft piano notes play, Bloomberg criticizes the \u201cshouting and hysterics\u201d in Washington and the \u201cpointed fingers\u201d and \u201cfearmongering\u201d by Trump on immigration.\n\nA grainy image of Trump flashes for a moment \u2014 a quick nod to the man he might challenge.\n\n\u201cAmericans are neither naive nor heartless,\u201d Bloomberg says. \u201cWe know that we can be a nation of immigrants while also securing our borders.\u201d\n\nBloomberg\u2019s top political advisers said he firmly believes there is enormous space in the political center and wants Democrats to court voters there and those on the right whose ties to Trump could be fraying. That runs counter to the positioning of many of his potential competitors for a Democratic nomination, who have moved sharply left in recent years.\n\n\u201cWhen you have the president threatening to shoot migrants at the border, that doesn\u2019t represent the center of the country or most of the GOP,\u201d said Howard Wolfson, a Bloomberg strategist. \u201cIt\u2019s critically important to him to talk to those Americans.\u201d\n\nThe ad, paid for by Independence USA PAC, a political action committee funded by Bloomberg, will air during broadcasts the president regularly views.\n\nIn a statement to The Washington Post on Sunday, Bloomberg said, \u201cThe country is deeply divided. The president and Republicans are fueling that division, and that holds us back as a nation. I\u2019m unwilling to sit by and accept it.\u201d\n\nWhile formally a pitch for Democrats \u2014 to whom Bloomberg has given more than $110 million this election cycle \u2014 the ad is also revealing of the kind of presentation he could bring to the 2020 campaign trail. He speaks flatly with the faded Boston accent from his youth, devoid of partisan passion and with a technocratic emphasis on competence.\n\nBeyond immigration, Bloomberg makes a broader case in the ad for political centrism in a time of national acrimony and political turmoil, and references the alleged anti-Semitic rampage by a gunman last month at Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh that left 11 people dead. Such an act \u201ctears at the heart\u201d of democracy and humanity, he says.\n\nBloomberg supplies few solutions, however, beyond asserting that \u201ccalm reasoning\u201d should be applied to difficult national issues.\n\nThe former mayor \u2014 who has been a Republican, independent and Democrat in his political career \u2014 also touched on other themes likely to surface if he runs for president: staunch support for gun control, a focus on climate change, and frustration with dysfunction in Congress and the rising federal deficit.\n\nBloomberg has been traveling to wealthy and highly educated suburban areas outside of Philadelphia and other cities to speak to Democratic audiences. It has been, in part, a charm offensive to Democrats skeptical of him and a political past that has been at times out of step with the party\u2019s base, from his defense of stop-and-frisk policing that civil rights groups denounce as racist to his tangles with labor unions over pensions.\n\nBloomberg\u2019s $110 million in political spending, dispersed to candidates and committees and related groups, has targeted expensive suburban House races in places such as California and Illinois, while also giving millions to the Democratic campaign to take back control of the U.S. Senate.\n\nThe former mayor told The Post in an interview last month that a Bloomberg presidential campaign would not run within the Democratic Party as it exists, exactly. Were it to happen, his campaign would effectively be a bid to reshape the party, and he argued that there is a recent precedent for electoral success by a billionaire who starts a campaign distant from his party\u2019s precepts.\n\n\u201cNo one ever thought Trump could win, either,\u201d Bloomberg said.\n\nMichael Scherer contributed to this report.", "BAGHDAD \u2014 Baghdad police say four people have been killed in four bomb blasts in the Iraqi capital, including two inside commuter minivans.\n\nThe blasts occurred after Sunday\u2019s evening rush hour and appeared to target Shiite districts around Baghdad, including Sadr City and Kadhimiya.\n\nPolice officials say the individual blasts were relatively small. They say about 20 people were wounded. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity, in line with police regulations.\n\nThe Islamic State group claimed responsibility in a statement posted by its Amaq News Agency and circulated on social media.\n\nThe militant group continues to terrorize Iraqis with kidnappings and bombings despite losing nearly all its territories to Iraqi forces last year.

Hegar was a long-shot Democratic candidate running to unseat a Republican incumbent who has held his House seat for 15 years. But her outlook brightened when she raised $750,000 over 10 days \u2014 an influx of cash that put her in contention for Texas\u2019s 31st Congressional District just outside of Austin.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just that Hegar, a tattooed veteran and mother, benefited from the wave of small, individual donations going to Democrats this election on the strength of anti-Trump sentiment.\n\nHer windfall was part of a carefully coordinated strategy behind the scenes by Democrats to increase the number of competitive House races nationally by attracting small-dollar donations to underdog candidates who otherwise would have been given little chance of success.\n\nDemocratic candidates raised more money than Republicans in the 2018 midterms, particularly in small sums under $200. Strategists across the political spectrum point to their breakneck fundraising pace as a sign that the party could be well positioned to take control of the House this year.\n\nRepublicans, too, have benefited from a surge in small-dollar donations, driven by loyal supporters of President Trump. The Republican National Committee raised $117 million in small contributions this election \u2014 more than half of its direct donations. That money, as well as millions from outside groups, has helped the GOP prop up struggling incumbents as the party seeks to retain its control of Congress.\n\nNonetheless, Democrats raised more than three times as much money in small-dollar donations as Republicans despite lacking the centralized organization of the GOP, harnessing the trend to widen the midterm landscape and giving more of their candidates a fighting chance.\n\n\n\nRep.

Twenty-two contests became competitive after Democrats began heavily fundraising.\n\nFor Abigail Spanberger, who is challenging Republican Rep. Dave Brat in Virginia\u2019s 7th Congressional District, a buzzworthy debate performance led to a gush of cash. For Kristen Carlson in Florida\u2019s 15th, it was an early endorsement from Emily\u2019s List, which supports women who back abortion rights. For Nancy Soderberg in Florida\u2019s 6th, campaign ads about health care caught donors\u2019 attention. For Joe Cunningham in South Carolina\u2019s 1st, the stunning primary loss of the three-term GOP incumbent signaled to donors that he might have a shot.\n\n[Democratic candidates for Congress have raised a record-shattering $1 billion this election]\n\nJoyce Abrams, 80, has donated this election through ActBlue, an online fundraising platform.

(Steve Helber/Associated Press)\n\n\u201cIn some cases, I\u2019m really doing token giving. . . . Sometimes, it\u2019s very important that there are numbers of people donating, as much as the amount,\u201d said Abrams, a registered Democrat in southern Oregon.\n\nThe amounts raised by first-time candidates in particular have upended fundraising expectations of political newcomers and underscored the intensity on the left \u2014 though Republicans note that being outraised does not matter if you are able to stay competitive and turn out your voters.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats\u2019 \u2018green wave\u2019 is challenging,\u201d Corry Bliss, executive director of Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC that supports House Republicans, warned donors last month in memos obtained by The Post. \u201cBut we don\u2019t need to outraise the Democrats, we only need to raise enough to compete and turn out our voters.\u201d\n\nThe green wave was less an act of nature than the result of careful planning on the part of Democrats.\n\nEven before the primary season, Democratic strategists worked to prepare candidates for moments of national attention, and on how to capi\u00adtal\u00adize on them.\n\nTo assist in the effort, an \u201cexpansion\u201d team of five Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee strategists tasked with widening the midterm map for the party crisscrossed the country, helping the campaigns quickly respond when a fundraising opportunity arose.\n\nIn the case of Hegar, the committee recognized that the Purple Heart recipient\u2019s story \u2014 from a violent childhood home, to a pilot in the Air Force, to a signatory on a lawsuit to end the ban on women in combat \u2014 could easily go viral. With a five-figure investment, the organization hired Democratic ad agency Putnam Partners to produce her 3\u00bd -minute ad, \u201cDoors,\u201d which became the most-watched campaign video of the election, with 3 million views.\n\nThe average donation the week after the video was released was less than $50 \u2014 a sign that her story resonated widely, her campaign said.\n\n\u201cThis is a story about doors, a lot of them,\u201d Hegar says in narrating the video, outlining challenges that required her to be \u201copening, pushing, sometimes kicking through every door that was in my way.\u201d\n\n[With blunt talk and compelling stories, viral videos are turning unknown female candidates into political sensations]\n\nA spokesman for the campaign of Republican Rep. John Carter, whom Hegar is seeking to unseat, said Hegar got a greater share of her donations from outside of Texas than Carter did.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s receiving more support from Californians than Texans. That is why her campaign has struggled so badly this fall. California donors love her ultraliberal agenda, but Texas voters don\u2019t,\u201d said Bruce Harvie, a Carter campaign spokesman.\n\nDemocrats this year have been buoyed by ActBlue, a sophisticated online fundraising tool that made donating as easy as one click on a smartphone.\n\nDonations through ActBlue have surpassed $1.5 billion for the 2018 cycle, with $250 million raised in October alone, according to the organization. There were more than 3 million new donors this cycle, with an average contribution of $40.\n\nUsers can choose from a menu of candidates and groups to donate to, and they have the option of donating to lists created by others, such as battleground candidates, female candidates or candidates who support \u201cMedicare-for-all.\u201d\n\nActBlue and other groups have allowed donors to give on impulse \u2014 when they are angry with the president, frustrated by Congress or hopeful about a candidate\u2019s ad message.\n\n\u201cThey read a Trump tweet, they see a video and they get really upset. They\u2019re sitting there, and have 15 minutes before their next meeting. How does their intention turn into productive action in that short period of time?\u201d said Ethan Todras-Whitehill, executive director and co-founder of Swing Left, which has raised $10 million for battleground House districts this cycle.\n\nSonia Immasche, a 72-year-old Democrat in Fort Collins, Colo., said she gave money when she felt the most enraged.\n\n\u201cSometimes when I\u2019m feeling particularly frustrated, I donate,\u201d said Immasche, who has given through ActBlue. \u201cWhat really fires me up is all the garbage that comes through in my emails and on Facebook, and occasionally on Twitter. . . . I want something meaningful to happen to our country and have it not be harmed further.\u201d\n\n[Where the money is going in the final push before Election Day]\n\nMany Democrats have benefited from this emotion-driven giving.\n\nThe fundraising success of Democratic challenger Amy McGrath has made the deep-red 6th Congressional District of Kentucky one of the most competitive races this fall.\n\nMcGrath has raised nearly $8 million \u2014 a rare feat for a first-time candidate \u2014 which has allowed the campaign to build a ground game with a field office in each of the 19 counties in her district, and print new yard signs that were personalized for every county.\n\nBut her operation also bumped up against the limits of what money can do. When it recently looked to place more television ads, the campaign found that there was no more airtime left to buy, said Mark Nickolas, McGrath\u2019s campaign manager.\n\nWhen Democrat Joe Cunningham announced his campaign in the Charleston, S.C., area, he was considered a long shot in his deeply pro-Trump district.\n\nThen, the stunning loss of incumbent Mark Sanford to a Trump-endorsed Republican primary opponent catapulted his campaign. Small-dollar donations started flowing. Cunningham has raised $1.9 million, one-quarter of it in low-dollar amounts.\n\n\u201cEvery Democratic candidate in the country has been looking for a moment this year . . . to tap into that national small-dollar fundraising army that exists for Democrats,\u201d said Tyler Jones, a general consultant for Cunningham\u2019s campaign. \u201cWhen we started to see an influx of fundraising, it made us all look at each other and say, \u2018We can do this.\u2019 \u201d", "Voters waited in line for as many as two hours to cast their ballots early in Marietta, Ga., last month. (Jessica Mcgowan/Getty Images)\n\nOn Saturday, voting rights advocates alerted lawyers for the Georgia secretary of state, as well as the FBI, of a potential vulnerability in the state\u2019s election system that they said could allow hackers to obtain and alter private voter information.\n\nOn Sunday, Republican Brian Kemp, who as secretary of state controls the state\u2019s election process even as he runs for governor, responded by accusing Democrats of possessing software that could have extracted personal voter data, and his office opened an investigation into what it described as \u201ca failed attempt to hack the state\u2019s voter registration system.\u201d\n\nKemp\u2019s campaign called Democrats \u201cpower-hungry radicals\u201d who should be held to account for \u201ctheir criminal behavior.\u201d Democrats called the probe \u201can abuse of power.\u201d\n\nThe controversy is the latest in a rash of concerns that have flared across the country, as candidates in both parties have traded accusations about threats to ballot integrity amid multiple reports about voting irregularities. The issue has started to affect voter confidence, according to new polling, which shows that a majority of voters in both parties are deeply suspicious about the opposing party\u2019s commitment to fair elections.\n\nThe growing uproar follows a spate of restrictive voting laws passed by Republicans in recent years that are now playing out across the country in closely contested races for House, Senate and governor. Lawsuits have been filed and harsh rhetoric has become the norm, with Republicans saying the tough new rules are necessary to combat voter fraud, while voting rights activists say the laws disproportionately affect young Americans and minorities, who tend to vote Democratic.\n\n\u201cAll levels of government and Law Enforcement are watching carefully for VOTER FRAUD, including during EARLY VOTING,\u201d President Trump tweeted Oct. 20. \u201cCheat at your own peril. Violators will be subject to maximum penalties, both civil and criminal!\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence of widespread voter fraud in the United States. In fact, study after study has shown that voter fraud is exceedingly rare. Trump launched a commission to investigate the issue shortly after he took office in 2017, but the commission disbanded early this year after many states refused to turn over voter information. During the months it was in place, the commission did not discover evidence of widespread voter fraud.\n\nNowhere has the issue been more prominent than in Georgia, where worries about voter disenfranchisement have dominated the bitter race for governor between Kemp and Democrat Stacey Abrams, who is attempting to become the first female African American governor in the nation\u2019s history. The vast majority of voter registration applications suspended this year under a strict new law have been those of African Americans.\n\nA spokeswoman for the secretary of state said Kemp\u2019s decision to investigate the potential cyber breach was proper because she said an email from Democratic Party officials contained software capable of trying to hack into the state\u2019s election system. Using such software is a crime, she said, which is why she posted a headline about the case on the secretary of state\u2019s government website \u2014 \u201cAFTER FAILED HACKING ATTEMPT, SOS LAUNCHES INVESTIGATION INTO GEORGIA DEMOCRATIC PARTY\u201d \u2014 directly beneath a voter\u2019s guide to polling locations.\n\n\u201cOur position is that these were failed attempts to hack the system,\u201d said Kemp spokeswoman Candice Broce. \u201cAll the evidence indicates that, and we\u2019re still looking into it.\u201d\n\nDemocrats said the email in question came from someone not affiliated with the party, and they produced an email showing that the party\u2019s voter protection chief forwarded it to two cyber security experts. The party accused Kemp of \u201cdefamatory accusations,\u201d while Abrams\u2019s campaign said Kemp\u2019s \u201cfalse accusations\u201d were \u201ca pathetic attempt to cover up for his failures\u201d to secure the state\u2019s voting system.\n\n[Brian Kemp\u2019s office orders \u2018hacking\u2019 probe of Georgia Democrats on eve of election he\u2019s competing in]\n\nVoting rights advocates are monitoring several other issues across the country:\n\n\u2022 In several battleground states, including Georgia, Nevada, Indiana and Wisconsin, hundreds of thousands of inactive voters have been removed from the rolls since 2016. Election officials have said the \u201clist maintenance\u201d comes after voters had not cast ballots in at least two federal elections, had moved or did not respond to information requests to verify their registrations. Voting rights activists are calling some of the activity improper voter \u201cpurges.\u201d A federal appeals panel ruled last week that Ohio must allow thousands of voters removed from the rolls between 2011 and 2015 to vote provisionally Tuesday.\n\n\u2022 In North Dakota, a restrictive voter ID law that requires voters to have a street address may make it harder for Native Americans, who are less likely to have the necessary identification, to cast ballots.\n\n\u2022 In Texas, some voters casting their ballots early on electronic machines reported that after choosing a straight Democratic ticket, the screen switched their choice for Senate from Democrat Beto O\u2019Rourke to Republican Ted Cruz. State election officials said they had received fewer than 20 reports of the glitch, which they blamed on old voting machines and did not expect it to influence the outcome. A small number of similar reports have emerged in North Carolina and Georgia.\n\n\u2022 In Dodge City, Kan., where 60 percent of residents are Latino, Ford County Clerk Deborah Cox is under fire for moving the city\u2019s only polling location from downtown to a location outside the city limits and a mile from the nearest bus stop, citing looming construction that has not yet started. A federal judge ruled Thursday that it is too close to Election Day to reopen the original location, but he also noted that he was \u201ctroubled\u201d by an email in which Cox wrote \u201cLOL\u201d after the American Civil Liberties Union asked her to help publicize their voter information hotline.\n\nKansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, a Republican in a close race for governor, has been a leading proponent of stricter voting laws. His office weighed in on the Dodge City controversy by claiming that a second location could allow for double voting.\n\n[Tuesday may be the \u2018warm-up\u2019 for Russians seeking to target 2020]\n\nVoters suspicious, poll finds\n\nAll of it has primed an already polarized political environment in which both Democratic and Republican voters are deeply suspicious of the opposing party\u2019s commitment to fair elections.\n\nAccording to a new poll from the Pew Research Center, most Americans have confidence that local poll workers will do a good job running elections Tuesday \u2014 but majorities of both Democrats (64 percent) and Republicans (56 percent) say the opposing party has \u201clittle or no commitment to fair and accurate elections.\u201d\n\nLayered on top of those anxieties are widespread worries about whether the United States is prepared to fend off hacking efforts by foreign governments and concerns about the integrity of electronic voting systems.\n\nAccording to the Pew poll, 85 percent of Americans favor requiring electronic voting machines to produce paper ballot backups. At least a dozen states do not have that system.\n\nIn Georgia, two regulations have caused worries: a new law demanding that voter information on registration applications exactly match existing government records \u2014 even down to a hyphen \u2014 and another requirement that a voter\u2019s signature match on an absentee ballot application and the ballot itself.\n\nAlthough the signature requirement is not new, a surge in absentee voting this year \u2014 and in rejected ballots \u2014 has led to scrutiny of its enforcement.\n\nVoting rights groups sued after election officials rejected hundreds of absentee ballots and suspended more than 50,000 registration applications, the vast majority of them from African Americans.\n\nTwo federal judges sided with the plaintiffs in both cases, ordering state and local officials to stop rejecting absentee ballots over signature mismatches and to give voters a chance to verify their identity before tossing registrations.\n\n\u201cI have never questioned, before now, that my vote would count, and that anybody else who made a sincere effort to vote would have their vote counted,\u201d said Whitney McGinniss, 35, a Democrat who works in public administration in suburban Atlanta, whose absentee ballot was challenged over a signature mismatch. \u201cMy opinion of that has really changed.\u201d\n\nMcGinniss said she had to send nearly two dozen emails to county elections officials to confirm that her absentee ballot would count after she was told her signature didn\u2019t match other records. County officials confirmed the exchange to The Washington Post, and that her ballot had eventually been accepted.\n\nNonetheless, a state database continued to list McGinnis\u2019s ballot as \u201cchallenged.\u201d She said she cast a provisional ballot at an early-voting location in case her mail-in vote wasn\u2019t counted upon the advice of local officials, despite the fact that a poll worker told her that voting twice was voter fraud.\n\n\u201cThis is not the way the process is supposed to work,\u201d she said.\n\nIn North Dakota, Native Americans have decried a strict requirement that voters show identification bearing their physical address. Many residents of tribal reservations don\u2019t have a physical address. They live outside the service area of the U.S. Postal Service and use post office boxes for mail delivery.\n\n[In Senate battleground, Native Americans fight voter ID restrictions]\n\nElection officials have urged such voters to create physical addresses for themselves using a rural address database that serves 911 service providers. But some have found that the addresses these systems produce can be inaccurate \u2014 and they worry that they could be charged with voter fraud if they use an ID with an inaccurate address, advocates said.\n\nTribal leaders are deploying officials to as many as 40 precincts with laptops, printers and CB radios (there is no cell service at many locations) to help voters produce acceptable tribal IDs on the fly.\n\n\u201cThe backbone of our democracy is being able to vote,\u201d said Carla Fredericks, a lawyer and member of the Mandan Hidatsa Arikara Nation, located in central North Dakota, who is helping the effort. \u201cIf people are not able to vote who are constitutionally allowed to vote, I don\u2019t think that speaks well to the legitimacy of our elections.\u201d\n\nFredericks said Native Americans, who tend to vote Democratic, are credited with Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp\u2019s victory in 2012. It\u2019s hard not to be suspicious, she said, that Republicans passed the law ahead of Heitkamp\u2019s reelection effort this year to discourage Native American participation.\n\nAl Jaeger, North Dakota\u2019s Republican secretary of state, said the activists\u2019 plan to position themselves outside of polling locations could cause even more confusion at the polls.\n\n\u201cEvery North Dakotan, every voter on Election Day, will be provided a ballot to mark and cast, or be given a set-aside ballot to mark,\u201d Jaeger said at a news conference Friday, according to the Bismark Tribune.\n\n'We're getting out to vote'\n\nAll told, two dozen states have passed restrictive voting laws since 2010, according to the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University\u2019s School of Law, including new measures since 2017 in Arkansas, Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, New Hampshire, North Carolina and North Dakota.\n\nWane Hailes, publisher of a newspaper in Columbus, Ga., aimed at African American and Hispanic readers, said he and other black voters were initially discouraged by the headlines in Georgia about thousands of voters of color having their registrations suspended or their ballots tossed. But that frustration is driving people to the polls, he said.\n\n\u201cI think what has happened over the last few weeks, with all of the attention going on, we\u2019re like, \u2018No, we\u2019re getting out to vote,\u2019\u201d said Hailes, who is 62 and also handles communications for the state chapter of the NAACP. \u201cOkay, now we\u2019re not going to let this happen.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, large armies of lawyers and other observers are being mobilized to monitor the polls Tuesday \u2014 and to be prepared for recounts and other legal action that could follow.\n\nPolitical committees, individual campaigns and civil rights groups will all deploy monitors. Common Cause, the civil rights organization, for instance, helped recruit 6,500 monitors this year \u2014 double the number in 2016, a presidential election year.\n\nThat\u2019s in part because of the expected boost in turnout. As of Saturday, the number of people voting early this year had outpaced that of the 2014 midterm elections in 28 states, according to data compiled by Michael McDonald, a political-science professor at the University of Florida. In two additional states, Texas and Nevada, early voting is on track to surpass the entire vote count four years ago, he said.\n\nNed Foley, a law professor and election-law expert at Ohio State University in Columbus, said it\u2019s never a good thing for even a single voter to lose the right to vote. But he also noted that glitches are inevitable and they shouldn\u2019t delegitimize an election unless they are so numerous as to have the power to change the outcome.\n\nIs that possible Tuesday? Certainly, Foley said, given how many closely fought races are in play. But it\u2019s also dangerous to be \u201coverly alarmist,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThat can feed the cynicism,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can feed the notion that it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nVanessa Williams in Georgia, David Weigel in New Jersey, Annie Gowen in Wisconsin and Scott Clement and Avi Selk in Washington contributed to this report.", "\n\nJournalist Jonathan Swan speaks onstage during Politicon 2018 in Los Angeles on Oct. 21. (Rich Polk/Getty Images For Politicon)\n\nJonathan Swan landed a big scoop about President Trump last week, another in a series of big scoops the young reporter has landed since Trump took office.\n\nThe reaction? Brutal.\n\nSwan, who covers the White House for the online news site Axios, was first to report that Trump intended to propose terminating \u201cbirthright citizenship,\u201d the constitutionally protected guarantee of citizenship for anyone born in the United States. Swan was so far ahead of the press pack on the story that even Trump expressed surprise that Swan knew about the proposal when Swan brought it up during a White House interview, which HBO will air on Sunday.\n\nNice work . . . except for a few things online critics weren\u2019t shy about pointing out.\n\nFor one, Axios\u2019s story and headline \u2014 \u201cExclusive: Trump to terminate birthright citizenship\u201d \u2014 failed to note that Trump can\u2019t just override the Constitution with the stroke of a pen (the story and headline were later amended to reflect this). For another, a clip of Swan\u2019s encounter with Trump drew an angry backlash on social media for Swan\u2019s failure to push back on Trump\u2019s claim that other countries don\u2019t have birthright citizenship (in fact, dozens do) or the notion that the proposal might just be a stunt by Trump to stir up anti-immigrant sentiment days before an election.\n\n\u201cThis is less a news story than it is a press release,\u201d wrote one critic, beneath a headline calling Swan \u201ca bootlicker.\u201d \u201cThis is a news outlet willingly staging a press event for a racist administration.\u201d\n\nThe triumph-to-fiasco nature of Swan\u2019s story marked a rare bit of turbulence for a reporter who has been on a sustained hot streak since Trump took office. Swan has broken story after story about Trump, drawing traffic and attention to Axios, a site founded just two years ago by a team that started Politico in 2007 .\n\nAmong his greatest hits: Swan was first to report that Trump intended to pull the United States out of the Paris climate accord; that Trump planned to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem; that White House chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon would be fired; that House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) wouldn\u2019t seek reelection; that Trump would end President Barack Obama\u2019s executive order protecting children brought to the United States by undocumented immigrants; that Anthony Scaramucci would be named White House communications director; and that Trump had accepted Nikki Haley\u2019s resignation as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.\n\nA few days after he broke the birthright citizenship story, Swan broke the news that Trump was \u201cstrongly\u201d considering State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert as Haley\u2019s replacement. Trump later confirmed the story, saying Nauert was \u201cunder very serious consideration\u201d for the job.\n\nThe run of stories puts Swan \u201cin the top tier\u201d of reporters covering Trump, says Bob Woodward, the legendary Washington Post reporter and author of the recent bestseller \u201cFear,\u201d about the Trump White House. \u201cI don\u2019t get the sense that he\u2019s soft at all,\u201d Woodward says. \u201cWalking that line of being tough but fair while also listening to the people you\u2019re covering is a delicate one, particularly in daily reporting. He\u2019s in that class that\u2019s hitting Trump pretty hard but listening to him and giving him\u201d a chance to air his side.\n\nWoodward says Swan belongs with the best of a rising group of Washington reporters that includes Maggie Haberman of the New York Times, Michael Bender of the Wall Street Journal and Robert Costa, Philip Rucker and Ashley Parker of The Post.\n\nWhat\u2019s noteworthy about Swan, 33, is that he\u2019s been a journalist for only a few years and a journalist in Washington for even less time than that.\n\nBorn and raised in Australia, he didn\u2019t get started in the profession until he was 25, despite journalism running in his family. Swan\u2019s father, Norman Swan, is famous Down Under as a health and science broadcaster. An aunt and uncle are also reporters in his native country.\n\nAfter short stints covering politics and other topics for the Sydney Morning Herald, Swan came to the United States in 2013 on an academic fellowship and served briefly as an aide on Capitol Hill. His first real American reporting job was with the Hill; he joined the publication in 2015, covering campaign finance and, occasionally, a candidate named Donald Trump. (Swan is an Australian citizen who holds a work visa; he intends to seek American citizenship after he marries his fiancee, Daily Beast political reporter Betsy Woodruff.)\n\nHis career accelerated when he joined Axios soon after its launch in early 2017. There he fell under the tutelage of the site\u2019s co-founders, chief executive Jim VandeHei and writer-editor Mike Allen, whom the site describes as \u201cthe world\u2019s most-wired reporter.\u201d VandeHei and Allen evidently saw in Swan the kind of plugged-in, high-metabolism journalist they have been in the course of working at The Washington Post and at Politico, which Allen and VandeHei left in 2016 after a falling-out with co-founder John Harris.\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t find a tougher, more thorough or harder-working reporter,\u201d says VandeHei of his protege. \u201cI could not be more proud of him, as a reporter and person. I would give my right arm for an army of Swans.\u201d\n\nVandeHei won\u2019t provide figures, but Swan\u2019s Trump scoops have undoubtedly played a major role in Axios\u2019s early traffic-building efforts. The site had 8.3 million unique visitors in September, according to the Web-tracking firm ComScore. That\u2019s a mere fraction of much larger competitors (Washington Post: 85.6 million; Politico: 32.4 million) but an impressive number for a young site with just two dozen editorial employees.\n\nSwan himself produces a weekly newsletter that has become a franchise unto itself. The newsletter, Axios Sneak Peek, has about 150,000 subscribers, according to VandeHei. Swan has also leveraged his TV appearances on \u201cMorning Joe\u201d and \u201cPBS NewsHour\u201d into a lucrative speaking career; he reportedly receives as much as $25,000 per speech, although his speakers\u2019 agency listing says his fees \u201cvary.\u201d\n\nSwan himself declined to comment on the record for this story. He had that in common with about a half-dozen of his competitors on the White House beat, all of whom spoke about him on the condition that they not be identified or quoted directly.\n\nEven accounting for competitive jealousies among reporters, the take on Swan among his peers is generally positive. Rivals on the beat say he earns his scoops fair and square, through an extensive network of contacts and connections and a seven-days-a-week work ethic. Notwithstanding the birthright citizenship episode, they describe Swan as a rigorous and independent reporter.\n\nThe one knock on Swan is that he isn\u2019t Washington\u2019s deepest reporter or finest writer; his stories sometimes read like news flashes or blurbs, shorn of context, depth or larger connections. His scoop about Trump\u2019s plans for the U.S. Embassy in Israel, for instance, was literally 55 words long.\n\nNevertheless, Woodward, for one, remains a fan. \u201cI don\u2019t know if Jonathan Swan gets the MVP award\u201d for reporting on Trump, he says. \u201cBut he\u2019s in that group worth watching. Maybe he\u2019s the rookie of the year.\u201d", "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Latest on President Donald Trump (all times local):\n\n5:10 p.m.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is campaigning for Georgia\u2019s Republican gubernatorial candidate, Brian Kemp, who is locked in one of the tightest races in the country.\n\nTrump praised Kemp at a rally Sunday in Macon as a \u201cstrong man\u201d and \u201cstrong personality\u201d and says Kemp will be a great governor.\n\nHe\u2019s also going after Kemp\u2019s Democratic opponent, Stacey Abrams, calling her \u201cone of the most extreme far-left politicians in the entire country.\u201d\n\nThe Georgia race has garnered attention from a list of high-profile backers, including Oprah Winfrey, who campaigned for Abrams last week.\n\nTrump says that Winfrey was a friend of his until he ran for office but is now urging Georgia voters to listen to his endorsement instead of hers.\n\nTrump has a second rally in Chattanooga, Tennessee, later Sunday.

While charter schools are publicly funded, they are privately operated and are not required in most places to be as transparent as publicly operated schools. The public also has little say in key operations of private and public schools that accept publicly funded vouchers.\n\nThis post, written by Carol Burris and Diane Ravitch, looks at the issue of governance and why it matters who is in charge.\n\nBurris is a former New York high school principal who now serves as executive director of the Network for Public Education, a nonprofit advocacy group. She was named the 2010 Educator of the Year by the School Administrators Association of New York State, and in 2013, the National Association of Secondary School Principals named her the New York State High School Principal of the Year. Burris has been chronicling problems with modern school restructuring and school choice for years on this blog. She has previously written about problems with charter schools in California and other states.\n\nRavitch, an education historian, became the titular leader of the movement against corporate school restructuring in 2010, when her book, \u201cThe Death and Life of the Great American School System,\u201d was published and became a bestseller. An assistant secretary of education under President George H.W. Bush, she explains in the book that she dropped her support for No Child Left Behind, the chief education initiative of President George W. Bush and standardized-test-based school restructuring, after looking at evidence about how it was harming public schools.\n\nBy Carol Burris and Diane Ravitch\n\nAt a meeting of the California Charter Schools Association during the spring of 2014, Netflix founder and CEO Reed Hastings told the audience that the problem with public schools is that they are run by elected school boards. He contrasted this style of school governance with that of charter schools, governed by private boards, which operate beyond the reach of the people. Hastings justified the movement of school governance from public to private hands by claiming that the private boards of charter schools are more stable. This is an odd claim considering that 33 percent of all charter schools that opened in 2000 were closed 10 years later. By year 13, 40 percent were gone.\n\nHastings acknowledged that the elimination of public control of public schooling, which had its beginnings in the early 19th century, would be met with community resistance. He therefore proposed an alternate plan to get the job done.\n\n\u201cSo what we have to do is to work with school districts to grow [charters] steadily, and the work ahead is really hard because we\u2019re at 8 percent of students in California, whereas in New Orleans, they\u2019re at 90 percent, so we have a lot of catch-up to do,\u201d he said.\n\nThe objective could not be clearer: Influence districts to expand their charter sector until eventually all, or nearly all, schools are privately operated and managed. Those district offices that remain could be filled not by educational leaders but by managers and technicians hired to ensure that buses run on time, schools are opened, closed or transferred to other operators, enrollment is managed, and funding is distributed. Public voice is stifled. Schools become publicly funded businesses.\n\nThis plan, of course, is not theoretical. The Network for Public Education Action\u2019s recent report, \u201cHijacked by Billionaires,\u201d documents that Hastings has spent nearly $10 million on pushing charters through referendums or school board elections in Los Angeles, Washington state and New Orleans alone. Hastings is one of a larger group of the uber-wealthy who share the same vision.\n\nIt is almost impossible to track all of the hundreds of millions spent by other billionaires such as the Walton family of the Walmart fortune, Arthur Rock, the family of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, Doris Fisher of The Gap and former Enron trader John Arnold in their quest to elect school board members and policymakers who will undermine the public\u2019s right to govern its schools.\n\nAs the school choice movement grows, the governance of schools has become a topic of great interest beyond the billionaire class. Last month, the California nonprofit think tank Learning Policy Institute issued a report entitled, \u201cThe Tapestry of American Public Education: How Can We Create a System of Schools Worth Choosing for All?\u201d The thesis of the report is that school choice \u2014 the movement to find alternatives to publicly funded and publicly operated school districts \u2014 is not an end in itself but rather a means to an end. In the words of the authors, it exists to \u201ccreate a system in which all children choose and are chosen by a good school that serves them well and is easily accessible. \u201c\n\nThere is much in the report with which we agree. The authors acknowledge that for 75 percent of parents, their first choice is a neighborhood public school, and therefore such schools must be preserved. They recognized many of the problems associated with publicly funded but privately operated charter schools \u2014 high suspension rates, corruption and increased segregation \u2014 and insist such deficiencies must be addressed.\n\nWhat concerns us, however, was the report\u2019s insistence that school governance doesn\u2019t matter. The authors deny the negative impact that charter schools have on the viability of neighborhood public schools, the very schools they acknowledge the vast majority want. We know from experience that charter schools and vouchers drain finances and the students they want from the district public schools, causing budget cuts, teacher layoffs and larger class sizes in the schools that enroll the most children. Yet the report suggests that charter school caps should be removed, which is likely to further destabilize public schools.\n\nFrom the first recommendation of the report:\n\n\u201cDebates that focus on questions such as how many charters a district should have are focused on adults and their preferences for school governance, rather than on the needs of children.\u201d\n\nThis claim is wrong. School governance directly affects the rights and well-being of students. Ask the students of the Delaware Academy of Public Safety and Security Charter High School, which was abruptly shut down just weeks after opening this September, leaving students scrambling to find a school. Or ask the students who were methodically pushed out of the Success Academy of Fort Greene in Brooklyn, which kept a \u201cgot to go\u201d list, or the 6-year-old boy whose mother says he was pushed out of an Arizona charter because of his disability.\n\nGovernance matters to a 4-year-old girl who attends Charter Day School in North Carolina. She is not allowed to wear pants to school because the charter school chain leader, conservative entrepreneur Baker Mitchell, bizarrely insists that his dress code promotes chivalry and protects the school from school shootings. There is no school board to which she can appeal. She can go only to the courts.\n\nIt is, in our opinion, irresponsible to minimize the importance of democratic governance with a scolding, false claim that those who care about it are not concerned with the welfare of children. The authors would do well to read the resolution of the National NAACP, which called for a moratorium on new charter schools because of the way they destabilize public schools while they are not subject to the same accountability, oversight and transparency as public schools.\n\n[NAACP sticks by its call for charter school moratorium, says they are \u2018not a substitute\u2019 for traditional public schools]\n\nOf related concern is the report\u2019s support for the \u201cportfolio\u201d model of school governance, specifically mentioning it as a strategy for school improvement. The phrase \u201cportfolio management\u201d was coined by charter advocate Paul Hill of the University of Washington to champion a system of publicly funded but privately managed charter schools.\n\nPortfolio management is based on a stock market metaphor \u2014 the portfolio manager is entrusted with retaining \u201cgood\u201d schools while turning \u201cbad\u201d schools over to a charter or shutting the school down, the same way one would dump a bad stock. Districts that adopt the model consistently end up with more charter schools and fewer public schools by design. You can read more about how this model has taken over the schools of Indianapolis here.\n\n[What\u2019s really going on in Indiana\u2019s public schools]\n\nTo push this model, a recently formed nonprofit, known as City Fund, is being heavily funded by Hastings\u2019s foundation and the Laura and John Arnold Foundation. Both foundations have invested a fortune into transforming publicly governed schools into a marketplace of schools dominated by charter schools. As mentioned earlier, Hastings and the Arnolds have contributed millions to the campaigns of school board members, organizations and legislators who share that goal.\n\nThose who push the portfolio model point to Denver and New Orleans as examples of success, but they avoid talking about the dismal failures of the model in Memphis, Nashville and Philadelphia. Ironically, Chris Barbic, the architect and leader of Tennessee\u2019s Achievement District, which produced abysmal results, is one of the leaders of City Fund.\n\nPublic governance of our schools matters for the health of our democracy. The public school was designed to serve and promote the common good; it is paid for by the public, and it belongs to the public, not entrepreneurs. If governance is really no more than an adult preference, how long will it be before private and religious schools are included in the portfolio as well?\n\nIn her thoughtful essay in the Atlantic, Amy Lueck traces the history of the American high school as a center and anchor for communities. She argues that school choice and the \u201ccharterization\u201d of public schooling is putting that institution at risk. Lueck concludes with this warning:\n\nAs an institution, the fate of the high school cannot be detached from the community of which it is a part. Like all educational institutions, it is inextricably wrapped up with the goals and values of the town, city, and nation in which it is located, reflecting and perpetuating them. Those values include Americans\u2019 attitude to the very schools that would pass them along, too. If, as a nation, we decide that the public schools are a \u201cdead end\u201d for students, we should not be surprised if they become so\u2014and along with them, the cities, towns, and communities they once built together.\n\nBillionaires live in an echo chamber of their own. As they jet across the globe to and from their many homes, the neighborhood school with its bake sales, homecoming dances and lively community elections are foreign and inconsequential. They believe that the role of the average woman or man is to be a consumer, not a decider.\n\nThe Learning Policy Institute may be sincere in its desire to preserve public education and in its belief that school choice can be \u201creformed.\u201d However, when it buys into the narrative that public governance of our schools does not matter, it is complicit in the agenda of those who seek to make public schools obsolete.\n\n-0-0-0-0-\n\nVS: (Correction: An earlier version said in my introduction to this piece that the public has no say in the operations of private and religious schools that get public funding. There are some public regulations that these schools must follow in most places.)", "Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger suffered an injury scare in Sunday\u2019s win over Baltimore, but returned to the game. (Gail Burton/AP)\n\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers remain in the \u201cLe\u2019Veon who?\u201d portion of their season.\n\nHoldout running back Le\u2019Veon Bell still was nowhere to be seen. James Conner, his replacement, again was the focal point of the offense. And the Steelers kept winning, posting their fourth straight victory as they beat the Baltimore Ravens, 23-16, on Sunday at M&T Bank Stadium, enduring an injury scare to quarterback Ben Roethlisberger along the way.\n\nThe Steelers upped their record to 5-2-1 and stayed ahead of the idle Cincinnati Bengals, who are 5-3, atop the AFC North. They added to mounting woes of the Ravens, who suffered their third straight loss to fall to 4-5.\n\nThe hold-your-breath portion of the day for the Steelers came when Roethlisberger landed on his right shoulder as he was tackled by Ravens linebacker Za\u2019Darius Smith at the end of a fourth-quarter run. Roethlisberger remained on the turf by the Steelers\u2019 sideline as members of the team\u2019s medical staff rushed to examine him.\n\n[Biggest moments from an exciting Week 9 of the NFL season]\n\nSuddenly, a Pittsburgh offense that has been without Bell all season \u2014 he has refused to sign his franchise-player deal and report to the team \u2014 was facing the prospect of being without Roethlisberger as well.\n\nBut as Roethlisberger stood on the sideline near midfield, without the medical staff around him, backup Joshua Dobbs delivered a key, 22-yard completion to wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster for a first down on his first regular season NFL pass.\n\n\u201cI almost left Josh in after that play,\u201d Roethlisberger said.\n\nRoethlisberger said he merely had the wind knocked out of him, an assessment echoed by Coach Mike Tomlin.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t breathe for a second,\u201d Roethlisberger said. \u201cYou\u2019re laying there. Once you start getting your breath, you start doing an evaluation. I knew right away it wasn\u2019t my head. Then you start talking shoulders, elbows \u2014 \u00adeverything like that. Once I was able to get up, I knew I\u2019d probably be okay.\u201d\n\nRoethlisberger trotted back on the field after missing only just that one play and soon provided a 51-yard strike to tight end Jesse James that led to a field goal to extend the Steelers\u2019 lead to 10 points.\n\nConner did much of the rest, continuing to thrive in Bell\u2019s absence. He ran for 107 yards on 24 carries. He had seven catches for 56 yards and a touchdown. No, he isn\u2019t Bell, but he is doing a pretty credible impersonation, delivering as both a runner and as a pass-catcher out of the backfield.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to take anything away from James,\u201d Tomlin said. \u201cBut the big boys up front are opening holes. And so it\u2019s a collective effort. James is going above and beyond. I\u2019m more pleased by what he\u2019s doing in the passing game and from a blitz-pickup standpoint. That\u2019s a little bit more unique than the rushing. We knew he could run the ball.\u201d\n\nConner managed only 19 rushing yards on nine carries when the Steelers lost to the Ravens, 26-14, on Sept. 30 in Pittsburgh. The Steelers haven\u2019t lost since, and it was clear practically from the outset Sunday that this game would be different for Conner. He had his fourth straight 100-yard rushing game and fifth of the season.\n\n\u201cThe last time we played them, we had some turnovers and penalties,\u201d Conner said. \u201cWe just had the opportunity to start fast \u00ad[Sunday].\u201d\n\nSome, including Steelers teammates, expected Bell to show up before the season. He didn\u2019t. It was reported that he would join the team during its recent bye week, or possibly after last week\u2019s trade deadline. He still hasn\u2019t.\n\nThe wisdom of Bell staying away and losing more than $855,000 per week of his $14.5 million franchise deal has been debated exhaustively. But there\u2019s no going back now \u2014 not for Bell and not for the Steelers. If Bell wants to play this season, under NFL rules he must report to the Steelers by Nov. 13.\n\nThe inclination for the Steelers and their fans might be to take a vindictive approach. They have done well without Bell, after all, but that probably would be the wrong option.\n\nIf Bell comes back, he probably wouldn\u2019t replace Conner in the lineup but should add value as a complementary player in the running game and as a pass-catcher. He probably would make the Steelers better.\n\nFor the Steelers, the Bell situation isn\u2019t merely about outlasting the Bengals and lapping the \u00adRavens in the division. It\u2019s about battling the New England Patriots and Kansas City Chiefs to be the AFC\u2019s top team. It\u2019s about winning the Super Bowl while they can with Bell, Roethlisberger and wide receiver Antonio Brown.\n\nBell probably can help that cause during whatever is left of his Steelers tenure.", "\n\nDuke Johnson had a breakout game against the Chiefs Sunday.

In 2017, Johnson caught 74 of 93 targets for 693 and three touchdowns; only Alvin Kamara (2.8) and Todd Gurley (2.1) produced more yards per route run than Johnson (2.1) that season, showing how valuable he could be for a late playoff run, especially if your league uses a point-per-reception, or PPR, scoring system.\n\nRyan Fitzpatrick, QB, Tampa Bay Buccaneers (30 percent)\n\nFitzpatrick got the start for the Bucs and once again worked his Fitzmagic: 24 completions on 40 attempts for 243 yards, three touchdowns and two interceptions. Heading into Sunday\u2019s game, he was the fourth most valuable passer per ESPN\u2019s Total Quarterback Rating (78.6 QBR), and Tampa Bay has the sixth-easiest schedule from Week 10 to 14, the weeks leading up to the start of the fantasy football playoffs, per Sharp Sports. Assuming he continues to get the nod over the benched Jameis Winston, Week 15 is probably the end of his value as a fantasy starter. Fitzpatrick and the Buccaneers face the Baltimore Ravens, a tough opponent, in Week 15.\n\n\n\nTampa Bay Buccaneers strength of schedule\n\nAdam Humphries, WR, Tampa Bay Buccaneers (97 percent)\n\nFitzpatrick targeted Humphries eight times Sunday against the Carolina Panthers, and the fifth-year pro caught all eight for 82 yards and two touchdowns. His target share has ramped up in recent weeks \u2014 he had nine in Week 7 and 10 in Week 8 \u2014 giving him a high floor in terms of fantasy points. Add in this week\u2019s touchdowns and you could have a surprise game-winner on your hands for the run up to the playoffs.\n\nIto Smith, RB, Atlanta Falcons (68 percent)\n\nDespite Tevin Coleman getting more carries, Smith continues to provide value out of Atlanta\u2019s backfield. Before facing the Washington Redskins on Sunday, Smith had 51 touches (third on the team) with three total touchdowns, and his yards per carry after contact (2.9) also are higher than any one else on the team. He got 10 carries Sunday against Washington, producing 60 yards and a score.\n\nWendell Smallwood, RB, Philadelphia Eagles (64 percent)\n\nSmallwood is emerging from the running back committee in Philadelphia. He has 60 carries for 257 yards and a touchdown for the Eagles, averaging 4.3 yards per carry. He also added 15 catches for 143 yards and two touchdowns. Plus, he played the same number of snaps (31) as Josh Adams and Corey Clement combined for Philadelphia during last Sunday morning\u2019s 24-18 victory at Wembley Stadium. In that game Smallwood touched the ball 10 times for 66 total yards and a touchdown, a 36-yard scamper into the end zone.\n\nDede Westbrook, WR, Jacksonville Jaguars (63 percent)\n\nWestbrook, a slot receiver, leads the team in receiving yards (404) and has produced the highest passer rating (109.4) for quarterback Blake Bortles in 2018. Jaguars had a bye in Week 9, but the subsequent matchup against the Indianapolis Colts should make him a viable injury or bye-week replacement. The Colts rank 25th against the pass, per Football Outsiders, and only have the 21st best pass rush, according to Pro Football Focus.\n\n\n\nBortles passer rating by WR\n\nFrank Gore, RB, Miami Dolphins (66 percent)\n\nAt 35 years old, Gore is averaging 4.6 yards per carry, his highest rate since 2012, a Pro Bowl year. He has only one touchdown in 2018, and that was on a passing play, but he leads the team in carries (104) and will face the Green Bay Packers in Week 10, a defense that ranks 24th against the run, with a stuff rate of less than 14 percent, placing Green Bay 29th in the league at stopping the run at or behind the line of scrimmage.\n\nNick Mullens, QB, San Francisco 49ers (99 percent)\n\nMullens, the surprise starter against the Raiders on Thursday night, completed 16 of 22 passes for 262 yards with three touchdowns and no interceptions, earning a near-perfect passer rating of 151.9. Mullens led the 49ers to their first win since Week 2, giving Coach Kyle Shanahan reason to leave him under center for Week 10.\n\n\u201cHe was very efficient,\u201d Shanahan told reporters after the game. \u201cMade some big plays. Got to number two in his progression. [Made] a couple of plays down in the red zone. Did a good job getting rid of the ball, changing his arm angle a number of times. And got us in and out of the huddle very efficiently.\u201d\n\nIf Mullens does get the start, he should be able to be a fantasy asset against a New York Giants defense that ranks 27th against the pass, per Football Outsiders.\n\nJordan Thomas, TE, Houston Texans (98 percent)\n\nIf you need help at tight end and want to take a flier, grabbing Thomas is a bold move.\n\nThe rookie tight end was targeted a season-high four times in Week 9, three in the red zone, catching two of those for touchdowns. On Sunday against the Denver Broncos, he caught another red-zone pass for a touchdown. Plus, quarterback Deshaun Watson loves to go to his tight ends inside the 20-yard line: His (15) attempts to the position in 2018 are the third most in the NFL.\n\nRead more from The Post:\n\nBrent Musburger made a controversial joke about Elizabeth Warren\u2019s heritage\n\nAir Force falcon mascot has \u2018life-threatening\u2019 injuries after prank by Army\n\nAaron Rodgers vs. Tom Brady, Rams vs. Saints highlight Week 9\n\nCollege football winners and losers from Week 10: Michigan\u2019s mean\n\nUFC 230: Daniel Cormier makes quick work of Derrick Lewis in heavyweight title bout", "Pete Davidson of \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d is facing mounting pressure to apologize for a widely condemned bit in which he mocked a wounded veteran and GOP congressional candidate for wearing an eye patch.\n\nFollowing Davidson\u2019s remarks about Dan Crenshaw, who on Tuesday won his election to represent Texas\u2019s 2nd Congressional District, the comedian, his show and SNL\u2019s executive producer were hammered by politicians, talk-show hosts, veterans and others.\n\n\u201cThis is absolutely appalling,\u201d tweeted Sen.

(Fayez Nureldine/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nU.S. and Israeli officials have expressed concern that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman may have less leeway to pursue the gradual warming of relations between Israel and its Arab neighbors amid the political fallout from the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nThe fate of the crown prince, the kingdom\u2019s de facto ruler, has implications for the Arab-Israeli peace package developed by the Trump administration and for cooperation among opponents of Iran.\n\n\u201cWe should not allow an action like that to go unanswered,\u201d the Israeli ambassador to the United States, Ron Dermer, told an audience last week, referring to Khashoggi\u2019s killing. \u201cBut we also have to be careful about not throwing away a relationship that has strategic value.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the administration, when they know all the facts, are going to have to decide, how can they on the one hand make clear that this action is unacceptable, but also not throw out the prince with the bathwater, let\u2019s put it that way.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump has called Saudi Arabia a key to regional stability and a valuable purchaser of American arms but has said little publicly about what a diminished role for the kingdom or Mohammed might mean for Israel or Arab-Israeli peace. Trump\u2019s chief Mideast envoy, son-in-law Jared Kushner, however, has discussed with diplomats and others how the crown prince\u2019s position might affect U.S. plans, people familiar with the discussions said.\n\n[Saudi crown price told White House that slain writer was a \u2018dangerous Islamist\u2019]\n\n\n\nOman\u2019s Sultan Qaboos bin Said Al Said meets with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Muscat, Oman, on Oct. 26, 2018.

But the kingdom\u2019s shifting explanations have angered and worried some Trump administration officials, who say the episode may leave the prince with less leverage to lead politically or culturally difficult shifts.\n\nMohammed has denounced the killing and denies involvement, but U.S. statements have stopped short of exonerating him. Current and former U.S. officials say the lethal operation could not have occurred without the prince\u2019s knowledge and approval.\n\nThe Trump administration revoked the visas or made travel ineligible for 21 Saudi nationals implicated by Turkey and Saudi Arabia in Khashoggi\u2019s death.\n\nIsraeli officials have become more vocal about separating the killing from the kingdom\u2019s strategic value.\n\n\u201cWhat happened in the Istanbul consulate was horrendous and it should be duly dealt with,\u201d Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Friday. \u201cYet at the same time, I say that it is very important for the stability of the world, of the region and of the world, that Saudi Arabia remain stable.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that a way must be found to achieve both goals, because I think that the larger problem is Iran,\u201d he said.\n\nBahraini Foreign Minister Khalid bin Ahmad al-Khalifa tweeted that Netanyahu showed \u201ca clear vision to the stability of the region and the role of Saudi Arabia to keep that stability.\u201d\n\n[Netanyahu calls Khashoggi killing \u2018horrendous\u2019 but stresses Saudi stability]\n\nMohammed, known by his initials MBS, has been the leading figure in a tentative and risky strategy to become more open about tacit or secret Israeli-Saudi cooperation. U.S. officials have hoped that he could also be the pivot point for a new, transactional Arab relationship with Israel that would undergird the Trump peace program.\n\nThat was always a long shot, and it was placed in heavy doubt over the summer.\n\nSaudi King Salman, the prince\u2019s father, reassured Palestinians and their Arab backers in July that he would not accept a peace plan that ruled out a Palestinian capital in East Jerusalem. The month before, Saudi and other Arab leaders told Kushner that the Trump administration\u2019s decision to move the U.S. Embassy to contested Jerusalem had jeopardized their support for a plan that had seemed imminent.\n\n\u201cThe Israeli perception is that MBS is much better for their own purposes,\u201d a Saudi government official said. \u201cIt is true that MBS has mentioned several times he would like to see a different Middle East and wasn\u2019t as sympathetic with Palestinians as they might have wished for.\u201d\n\nAnd on Iran, \u201cMBS did give Israel more security in the sense that he was framing Iran as the biggest threat,\u201d the official said. The official as well as others from the Middle East and elsewhere spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect diplomatic discussions.\n\nTrump\u2019s chief negotiator, lawyer Jason D. Greenblatt, was in Israel this weekend amid signs that the plan, repeatedly shelved in recent months, may be released soon.\n\nAt the time of his last meeting with Netanyahu, in late September, Trump had said the plan would be made public in two to four months. Khashoggi was killed a week after that meeting, and it is not yet clear whether it altered the White House timeline.\n\nThe plan is expected to offer the possibility of a package deal for a settlement among Israel and Arab neighbors. Saudi pressure on the Palestinians to accept a settlement is considered crucial.\n\nThe Trump peace package has undergone several revisions, including a step back from a plan to soften the ground for talks and increase pressure on the Palestinians to accept a deal, said a foreign diplomat familiar with aspects of the White House thinking.\n\nThe crown prince was supposed to be a key figure in that approach but had already \u201chad his wings clipped\u201d somewhat over the embassy move when the Khashoggi case added new questions about his influence, the diplomat said.\n\n\u201cMBS is not going to do the heavy lifting expected before now, and they are deciding what to do next,\u201d the diplomat said.\n\nAn Israeli government official said Saudi Arabia is already playing a main role by allowing or encouraging small diplomatic steps over the past month.\n\nSaudi Arabia, the most powerful gulf Arab state, has sent signals to Oman, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain condoning diplomatic overtures to Israel, the official said.\n\n\u201cAll the current steps between Israel and especially gulf states wouldn\u2019t have been possible without the backing of the Saudis,\u201d the official said.\n\n\u201cAnd the change of mind inside the Saudi has, from our perspective, a lot to do with MBS. He did open the door for more visible and official relationships with countries in the region.\u201d\n\nNetanyahu visited Oman late last month, the highest-level contact between the countries since 1996. The talks were focused on the prospects for peace and on Iran, diplomats said.\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s office called the trip \u201ca significant step in implementing the policy outlined by Prime Minister Netanyahu on deepening relations with the states of the region while leveraging Israel\u2019s advantages in security, technology and economic matters.\u201d\n\nThe goal is to combine forces against Iran and open Israel\u2019s strong economy to greater Arab investment and partnership.\n\n\u201cWe welcome the warming ties & growing cooperation between our regional friends,\u201d Greenblatt tweeted about the visit. \u201cThis is a helpful step for our peace efforts & essential to create an atmosphere of stability, security & prosperity between Israelis, Palestinians & their neighbors.

Thankfully, things will calm down by midweek.\n\nListen to our daily D.C. forecasts: Apple Podcasts | Amazon Echo | More options\n\nThrough tonight: Nothing but sunshine to finish out the day, which as a reminder, now ends at 5:04 p.m. Clouds will quickly begin to move in just before midnight, leaving us with mostly cloudy skies for the overnight period. Showers will move in from the south after 3 a.m., with light rain overspreading the region just before sunrise. Low temperatures will range from the mid- to upper 40s, with low 50s downtown. Winds will be light out of the east at about 5 mph.\n\nView the current weather at The Washington Post.\n\nTomorrow (Monday): Things will be very wet to start out the workweek. Widespread light to moderate rain will be draped across the region tomorrow morning, making for a tough commute. A few rumbles of thunder can\u2019t be ruled out. The steady rain should shift east of our area by the early afternoon, but not before upward of an inch of rain has fallen. Mostly cloudy and cool for the remainder of the day, with highs in the low 50s. Mostly cloudy with a slight chance of scattered showers tomorrow night, with lows in the upper 40s to low 50s.\n\nSee Brian Jackson\u2019s forecast through next weekend.

The tornado in Baltimore resulted in two fatalities after a wall caved in at one of Amazon.com\u2019s distribution centers. These were the first tornado-related fatalities in Maryland since 2002.\n\n\n\nThe path of Friday night's tornado in Baltimore. The tornado reached maximum intensity right as it clipped the Amazon building, ripping part of the roof off. (NWS)\n\nBoth tornadoes came without any official warning, although there were signs of potential trouble by Friday afternoon. At the core of the issue was a drastic contrast in air masses, located on both sides of a potent cold front. Additionally, a wave of low pressure developed and strengthened rather quickly right along the front. All of those ingredients resulted in a few hours of extreme and localized instability.\n\n\n\nThe surface map from 8 p.m. Friday shows a cold front approaching and a low pressure system developing along the front. Notice the stark contrast in wind direction (blue lines) and dew points (green numbers) on either side of the front. The humid air ahead of the front, combined with a lot of low-level spin from the contrasting winds, created a brief, idealized environment for tornado development. (NWS)\n\nCompounding the problem was the presence of heavy rain and the lack of daylight. Deep pockets of heavy rain developed right along the front, which meant that both tornadoes were \u201crain wrapped,\u201d making them somewhat invisible to radar detection as well as to the naked eye. We do have the capability to look through the rain and diagnose rotation with other products. However, these storms were moving fast with a tight and localized rotation signature, making them extremely hard to diagnose in real time.\n\nWant our 5 a.m. forecast delivered to your email inbox?

It\u2019s about the economy. It\u2019s about power and who will hold it, both in Washington and in the states. Above all, it\u2019s about something more elemental: what kind of country Americans see today and want to see in the future. That makes these midterms unlike any in the recent past.\n\nTalk to voters almost anywhere about what this election means to them, and the answer almost invariably involves personal feelings about President Trump and perceptions about the overall state of the country. This debate about America\u2019s divisions has been underway for some time, but Trump has raised the emotional level to something not seen before.\n\nThis is an election that is being fought in individual districts and states, with traditional tools: money, advertising and boots on the ground. Television ads by Democrats hammer Republicans on this or that issue; Republican ads hammer Democrats. Money is coursing through congressional campaigns at levels not seen before. Voter mobilization is as sophisticated and robust as it has ever been. At the margins, those weapons can make a difference.\n\nBut it is the larger question about the values of the nation that has produced what we\u2019ve seen over weeks and months. It is that unsettling, and unsettled, issue that has generated the record amounts of money raised and spent, and the remarkable outpouring of volunteers never before active who are walking precincts and making calls in these final hours \u2014 as they have been for months. It is what has motivated record numbers of people in many states to cast ballots ahead of Election Day. Together, those indicators have stamped this campaign as a once-in-a-generation event.\n\nThis is a divided country, growing more so under this president. Hostility from those in one party toward those in the other has risen. Divisions between urban and rural America have widened. Men and women are on opposites sides in assessments of the president \u2014 including in some marriages \u2014 and the gender gap has been at record levels. Education has become a new and significant fault line, dividing those with college degrees and those without.\n\nOne of the beauties of American politics is its diversity \u2014 from one region to another, from one state to another, and even within states. Each state or region has its own political history and culture. Each has its peculiarities, its good or bad candidates, its local conditions.\n\nA midterm election is like a pointillist painting, each individual race a dot that by Wednesday morning will add up to an image that will provide some answer to the question of the moment: the identity of America as it is today, its aspirations and values, the tone and tenor of the debate.\n\n[Americans talk about the midterm election and voting]\n\nTrump has decided views on these things. Many Americans are thrilled by what he has done or tried to do to shake up a political status quo that left them feeling like outsiders. They see his opponents the same way he often describes them, as enemies of him and of the country. But his presidency also has triggered a powerful backlash that is being felt on this final weekend before Election Day as it has been felt from the day he was inaugurated. His presidency has been a time of raw political anger. The clash of these values and perceptions will produce a rendering on Tuesday.\n\nBecause of geographical differences in a divided America, what happens on Tuesday could hit with unequal force. If things break as now appears possible, the election could wash away the Republican majority in the House and boost Democrats in gubernatorial and state legislative races. But it could leave Democrats still short of a majority in the Senate because nearly all of the most competitive races are now in red states.\n\nPolls show close races for the Senate, the House and governorships. Polls have been wrong before. This could be a wave election, which is to say an election that produces results that overcome structural obstacles and impediments facing the minority party.\n\nIn this case, it is the strength of the economy that could help Republicans avoid the worst and another factor that makes Tuesday\u2019s election different from those past. Look back to 1982, to 1994, to 2006 and to 2010. Those midterms saw the parties of two Republican presidents and two Democratic presidents suffer significant setbacks, but the ingredients were different than they are today \u2014 more customary, more understandable.\n\nThe 1982 midterm election was all about the economy. The country was in a deep recession, and the unemployment rate hit 10 percent in September of that year, the first time it had been in double digits in four decades. Democrats picked up roughly two dozen seats in the House, adding to their majority and dealing a blow to then-President Ronald Reagan.\n\nIn 1994, anger with government, corruption scandals in the House and legislative missteps by then-President Bill Clinton and congressional Democrats led to a historic revolt by the voters. After 40 years of Democratic rule in the House, Republicans led by soon-to-be-speaker Newt Gingrich swept to power on a tide of anti-government sentiment.\n\nBy 2006, the focus of the midterms was on the issue of war and peace, namely the growing unpopularity of the Iraq War, coupled with declining confidence in the leadership of then-President George W. Bush, over both the war and his administration\u2019s handling of the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina. The combination cost Republicans their House majority.\n\nFour years later, Republicans rode a huge groundswell of dissatisfaction to take back the House. In that case, Democrats under the leadership of then-President Barack Obama were done in by the slow pace of recovery from the worst recession since the Great Depression and deep political divisions over the Affordable Care Act, which had passed without Republican support.\n\n[Women will decide the midterms. Here\u2019s what they think about the choice]\n\nAs with so much else about the Trump presidency, this midterm election is in a class of its own, given that it is taking place at a time of economic prosperity. The country\u2019s economic engine is running at peak power, and yet much of the electorate is consumed instead by the style, behavior and personality of the president.\n\nFriday\u2019s employment report from the Labor Department couldn\u2019t have brought better news. All the indicators were moving in the right direction \u2014 job growth, wage growth, the unemployment rate and labor force participation. Yet in the midst of one of the best economies in decades, at a time of rising economic and consumer confidence, the campaign has been about almost anything but that. It has not been, however, about nothing.\n\nTrump has gone back to spreading fear and division over immigrants, particularly a caravan of migrants hundreds of miles from the southern border. He has chosen to play down good news. Finally, on Saturday night in Florida, he spoke at some length about the economy. Mostly, however, he favors broadsides about law and order and what he calls Democratic \u201cmobs.\u201d Which is why the choice for many voters is not about personal finances or the economy or the tax cuts but about whether the country needs change.\n\nTuesday\u2019s results could produce surprises. Elections like this often do. The outcome could change the balance of power in Washington, or it could leave Democrats wondering how they missed out again. It will provide a partial answer to the question of what kind of America this is and should be. A more definitive answer will come later, and by Wednesday, people will shift their focus toward another campaign two years from now.", "\n\nJournalist Jonathan Swan speaks onstage during Politicon 2018 in Los Angeles on Oct. 21. (Rich Polk/Getty Images For Politicon)\n\nJonathan Swan landed a big scoop about President Trump last week, another in a series of big scoops the young reporter has landed since Trump took office.\n\nThe reaction? Brutal.\n\nSwan, who covers the White House for the online news site Axios, was first to report that Trump intended to propose terminating \u201cbirthright citizenship,\u201d the constitutionally protected guarantee of citizenship for anyone born in the United States. Swan was so far ahead of the press pack on the story that even Trump expressed surprise that Swan knew about the proposal when Swan brought it up during a White House interview, which HBO will air on Sunday.\n\nNice work . . . except for a few things online critics weren\u2019t shy about pointing out.\n\nFor one, Axios\u2019s story and headline \u2014 \u201cExclusive: Trump to terminate birthright citizenship\u201d \u2014 failed to note that Trump can\u2019t just override the Constitution with the stroke of a pen (the story and headline were later amended to reflect this). For another, a clip of Swan\u2019s encounter with Trump drew an angry backlash on social media for Swan\u2019s failure to push back on Trump\u2019s claim that other countries don\u2019t have birthright citizenship (in fact, dozens do) or the notion that the proposal might just be a stunt by Trump to stir up anti-immigrant sentiment days before an election.\n\n\u201cThis is less a news story than it is a press release,\u201d wrote one critic, beneath a headline calling Swan \u201ca bootlicker.\u201d \u201cThis is a news outlet willingly staging a press event for a racist administration.\u201d\n\nThe triumph-to-fiasco nature of Swan\u2019s story marked a rare bit of turbulence for a reporter who has been on a sustained hot streak since Trump took office. Swan has broken story after story about Trump, drawing traffic and attention to Axios, a site founded just two years ago by a team that started Politico in 2007 .\n\nAmong his greatest hits: Swan was first to report that Trump intended to pull the United States out of the Paris climate accord; that Trump planned to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem; that White House chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon would be fired; that House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) wouldn\u2019t seek reelection; that Trump would end President Barack Obama\u2019s executive order protecting children brought to the United States by undocumented immigrants; that Anthony Scaramucci would be named White House communications director; and that Trump had accepted Nikki Haley\u2019s resignation as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.\n\nA few days after he broke the birthright citizenship story, Swan broke the news that Trump was \u201cstrongly\u201d considering State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert as Haley\u2019s replacement. Trump later confirmed the story, saying Nauert was \u201cunder very serious consideration\u201d for the job.\n\nThe run of stories puts Swan \u201cin the top tier\u201d of reporters covering Trump, says Bob Woodward, the legendary Washington Post reporter and author of the recent bestseller \u201cFear,\u201d about the Trump White House. \u201cI don\u2019t get the sense that he\u2019s soft at all,\u201d Woodward says. \u201cWalking that line of being tough but fair while also listening to the people you\u2019re covering is a delicate one, particularly in daily reporting. He\u2019s in that class that\u2019s hitting Trump pretty hard but listening to him and giving him\u201d a chance to air his side.\n\nWoodward says Swan belongs with the best of a rising group of Washington reporters that includes Maggie Haberman of the New York Times, Michael Bender of the Wall Street Journal and Robert Costa, Philip Rucker and Ashley Parker of The Post.\n\nWhat\u2019s noteworthy about Swan, 33, is that he\u2019s been a journalist for only a few years and a journalist in Washington for even less time than that.\n\nBorn and raised in Australia, he didn\u2019t get started in the profession until he was 25, despite journalism running in his family. Swan\u2019s father, Norman Swan, is famous Down Under as a health and science broadcaster. An aunt and uncle are also reporters in his native country.\n\nAfter short stints covering politics and other topics for the Sydney Morning Herald, Swan came to the United States in 2013 on an academic fellowship and served briefly as an aide on Capitol Hill. His first real American reporting job was with the Hill; he joined the publication in 2015, covering campaign finance and, occasionally, a candidate named Donald Trump. (Swan is an Australian citizen who holds a work visa; he intends to seek American citizenship after he marries his fiancee, Daily Beast political reporter Betsy Woodruff.)\n\nHis career accelerated when he joined Axios soon after its launch in early 2017. There he fell under the tutelage of the site\u2019s co-founders, chief executive Jim VandeHei and writer-editor Mike Allen, whom the site describes as \u201cthe world\u2019s most-wired reporter.\u201d VandeHei and Allen evidently saw in Swan the kind of plugged-in, high-metabolism journalist they have been in the course of working at The Washington Post and at Politico, which Allen and VandeHei left in 2016 after a falling-out with co-founder John Harris.\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t find a tougher, more thorough or harder-working reporter,\u201d says VandeHei of his protege. \u201cI could not be more proud of him, as a reporter and person. I would give my right arm for an army of Swans.\u201d\n\nVandeHei won\u2019t provide figures, but Swan\u2019s Trump scoops have undoubtedly played a major role in Axios\u2019s early traffic-building efforts. The site had 8.3 million unique visitors in September, according to the Web-tracking firm ComScore. That\u2019s a mere fraction of much larger competitors (Washington Post: 85.6 million; Politico: 32.4 million) but an impressive number for a young site with just two dozen editorial employees.\n\nSwan himself produces a weekly newsletter that has become a franchise unto itself. The newsletter, Axios Sneak Peek, has about 150,000 subscribers, according to VandeHei. Swan has also leveraged his TV appearances on \u201cMorning Joe\u201d and \u201cPBS NewsHour\u201d into a lucrative speaking career; he reportedly receives as much as $25,000 per speech, although his speakers\u2019 agency listing says his fees \u201cvary.\u201d\n\nSwan himself declined to comment on the record for this story. He had that in common with about a half-dozen of his competitors on the White House beat, all of whom spoke about him on the condition that they not be identified or quoted directly.\n\nEven accounting for competitive jealousies among reporters, the take on Swan among his peers is generally positive. Rivals on the beat say he earns his scoops fair and square, through an extensive network of contacts and connections and a seven-days-a-week work ethic. Notwithstanding the birthright citizenship episode, they describe Swan as a rigorous and independent reporter.\n\nThe one knock on Swan is that he isn\u2019t Washington\u2019s deepest reporter or finest writer; his stories sometimes read like news flashes or blurbs, shorn of context, depth or larger connections. His scoop about Trump\u2019s plans for the U.S. Embassy in Israel, for instance, was literally 55 words long.\n\nNevertheless, Woodward, for one, remains a fan. \u201cI don\u2019t know if Jonathan Swan gets the MVP award\u201d for reporting on Trump, he says. \u201cBut he\u2019s in that group worth watching. Maybe he\u2019s the rookie of the year.\u201d", "FILE- In this Saturday, Nov. 3, 2018, file photo immigrants seeking asylum in the United States walk off of the the International Bridge in Reynosa, Mexico. Asylum seekers already camping at border crossings worry that how the Trump administration responds to the caravan of some 4,000 Central American migrants and three much smaller ones hundreds of miles behind it could leave them shut out. (Eric Gay, File/Associated Press)\n\nMATAMOROS, Mexico \u2014 Waiting on the southern end of a bridge that leads to the United States, Humberto Alvarez Gonzalez warily follows the progress of the caravan winding through Mexico with the goal of reaching the border.\n\nAlvarez and about two dozen other people are waiting in Matamoros, across the Rio Grande from Brownsville, Texas, because U.S. customs officers say there\u2019s no space to process them. They sleep on cots near the bridge and rely on donors who bring them food and clothing. Some have waited for two weeks.\n\nNow, Alvarez, a 32-year-old from Cuba, is worried that large waves of migrants in a caravan still more than 800 miles away from the border might provoke the U.S. government to reject them altogether.\n\n\u201cOur idea is to enter before the caravan,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are afraid that the group of migrants will reach us and that they will judge us together with them.\u201d\n\nAsylum seekers already camping at border crossings worry that how the Trump administration responds to the caravan of some 4,000 Central American migrants and three much smaller ones hundreds of miles behind it could leave them shut out. President Donald Trump last week threatened to detain asylum seekers in large tents and send as many as 15,000 active-duty soldiers to the border. He\u2019s also spoken of closing the border.\n\nU.S. government officials say the bridges remain open to asylum seekers. But in South Texas, the busiest corridor for unauthorized border crossings, U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers stand at the center of bridges to check documents and stop most asylum seekers.\n\nAnd in San Diego, people at the San Ysidro crossing wait more than a month, and volunteers operate an informal take-a-number system to spare migrants from having to wait in line or sleep out in the open. Inspectors there typically process about 100 claims a day.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not turning people away, it\u2019s asking them to wait,\u201d CBP Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said recently. \u201cWe are taking people in as we have capacity to do so.\u201d\n\nAt the bridge where Alvarez and dozens of others wait, security guards on the Mexican side hold back asylum seekers until U.S. border inspectors tell them how many people they will accept. Some days, five or 10 people are allowed. On other days, the asylum seekers said, no one is.\n\nAt another bridge separating Brownsville and Matamoros, four women and their children slept under a blue tarp on the bridge. The tarp had been left behind by previous asylum seekers. One of the women said she had waited there for two days.\n\nSeeking asylum at a port of entry is legal under U.S. law, as government officials have reaffirmed this year. Trump has proposed banning people crossing illegally between ports of entry from claiming asylum \u2014 something many immigration experts say he can\u2019t do under the law.\n\nThe U.S. fielded nearly 332,000 asylum claims in 2017, nearly double that of two years earlier and the highest of any country in the world, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. And many asylum seekers wait for years to have their claims adjudicated, a delay criticized by administration officials and immigration lawyers alike.\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions ruled in June that fleeing gang or domestic violence would generally not be considered grounds for asylum, a decision that would affect many people\u2019s claims.\n\nJodi Goodwin, an immigration attorney in Harlingen, Texas, said she believes the government was trying to frustrate asylum seekers into giving up.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019re using a lot of ruse and double-speak to try to circumvent the law,\u201d she said.\n\nTwo women and three children were waiting Saturday at the center of the bridge between McAllen, Texas, and Reynosa, Mexico, a day after soldiers had installed concertina wire on the bridge and the riverbank below.\n\nAfter some time, an official from Mexico\u2019s migration bureau came up to the group of five and directed them off the bridge, away from U.S. customs.\n\nAssociated Press journalists followed as the official and then a private security guard led the group back into Mexico and into a migration bureau office. An employee inside the building would not let the AP interview the group, and U.S. border inspectors on the bridge declined to comment.\n\nAt the bridge in Matamoros, Mexico, Alvarez continued to wait with others from all over the world: Honduras, Peru, Venezuela and Cameroon.\n\nThey insisted they will only enter peacefully and lawfully, waiting their turn at the bridge.\n\nJavier Mederos Mendez, a 44-year-old from Havana, said he was fleeing political repression because he disagreed with the ruling Castro family. He said he had flown from Cuba to South America, then crossed through jungles and violence-torn areas of Central America and Mexico to reach the bridge.\n\nHe and others had seen people drown or starve along the way.\n\nAsked what he thought of Trump\u2019s announcements about asylum, Mederos said, \u201cIt would be unfair of me to decide what is good or bad for a country.\u201d\n\nBut, he said, \u201cI will wait as long as necessary until they receive me.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Elliot Spagat in San Diego contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

It\u2019s normal while walking to pass beneath the outdoor flags of Michigan or Georgia or others. What a thought, though, to walk through Hell\u2019s Kitchen one recent day and spot the flag rippling ever so slightly outside: RUTGERS.\n\nIt flooded the brain with thoughts of bleakness and desolation, of scattered patrons in various stages of semiconsciousness. What do they serve in there, anyway? Must they attain some special legal waiver for added potency?\n\nMy god, how might it look this coming Saturday?\n\nSomehow, the American Northeast is about to become college-football relevant after a dormancy that could have led some to believe much of it had disbanded football operations. On Saturday, the behemoth No. 2 Clemson (9-0) will travel all the way up to Boston College (7-2), which figures to slide upward from its No. 22 spot after its win at Virginia Tech even if Virginia Tech (4-4) has slid to forlorn.\n\nOn the Saturday after that, No. 4 Notre Dame (9-0), which will occupy No. 3 by Tuesday, will come to Yankee Stadium, that architectural marvel currently owned by the Boston Red Sox. There, the Irish will find No. 19 Syracuse (7-2), which could be 8-2 if it can remember its purpose against hapless, helpless, hopeless Louisville (2-7), which just allowed 11.6 yards per play to Clemson, the most for a Clemson team since 1903, when people calculated yards-per-play by using ancient pencils.\n\n[Alabama\u2019s thrashing of LSU is an exercise in the art of domination]\n\nIt\u2019s quite something, what has transpired this fall at Syracuse which, as the Southeast has hogged more and more spotlight, had gone very forgotten in a country full of the forgotten. \u201cRegardless of whatever happens, they\u2019re going to be known as the class that got everything turned around,\u201d the third-year Coach Dino Babers said after two 4-8 seasons and after a 41-24 win at Wake Forest that followed a two-week sweep of North Carolina and North Carolina State.\n\nWhile seven wins, as Babers said, \u201cguarantees these guys a winning season, not finishing out .500 or dropping below .500 in a bowl game,\u201d one of the two losses might impress most. Remember, on Sept. 29, Syracuse led 23-13 in the fourth quarter at Clemson, and then led 23-20 with 2:50 left, and with a third-string quarterback taking Clemson\u2019s snaps.\n\nWhen he, Chase Brice, found the budding star Tee Higgins for a 20-yard gain, Clemson went on to sustain its unbeaten status and reiterate its uncommon knack for managing stress. Now Syracuse has just Louisville along the way toward major attention against Notre Dame, and with quarterback Eric Dungey warning reporters of Louisville, \u201cWe were in that position before. No one respected us,\u201d a revelation they\u2019re even mastering the cliche of the ages.\n\nAs Clemson heads to where they\u2019re sweeping up from the Red Sox parade, its four wins since Syracuse have come by a combined 240-36. Boston College quarterback Anthony Brown called Clemson \u201cprobably the best team in America,\u201d which goes to show how the northeast can be isolated as news of Alabama hasn\u2019t reached it yet. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of meat left on our bone,\u201d Brown said, a revelation they\u2019re mastering good, fresh lines.\n\n[College Football winners and losers Week 10: Michigan\u2019s mean]\n\nBoston College rambled through Virginia Tech with 24 second-half points in its 31-21 win, saddled Virginia Tech with a third straight home loss for the first time since 1992, and reminded everyone that whenever some areas brighten, others dim.\n\nIt\u2019s arithmetically inescapable.\n\nGaze away from the Northeast for a moment, and remember: \u2019Tis the season to grumble about coaches, as opposed to other times of year when people grumble about coaches. Look at all the places preparing for a spell of grumbling, some of it even irrational, for which we\u2019re all grateful. Among places which expect more than they\u2019re getting, they\u2019re about to grumble for a while about the third-year coach at Virginia Tech (4-4), the fifth-year coach at Penn State (6-3), the third-year coach at Miami (Fla.) (5-4), the fourth-year coach at Southern California (5-4), the second-year coach at Texas (6-3) and even the first-year coach at Florida (4-3), which just took a 38-17 home ransacking from a good but previously conference-winless Missouri.\n\nIn the case of Texas, it\u2019s important to take note of the happy side, which is that West Virginia\u2019s hopes all continue because Coach Dana Holgorsen shooed all human doubts and went for a winning two-point conversion twice in a row in Austin.

Hey, bartender . . .", "New York, a city largely free from the college football pathogen that has afflicted so many of us, does have its designated and loosely designated college football saloons. It\u2019s normal while walking to pass beneath the outdoor flags of Michigan or Georgia or others. What a thought, though, to walk through Hell\u2019s Kitchen one recent day and spot the flag rippling ever so slightly outside: RUTGERS.\n\nIt flooded the brain with thoughts of bleakness and desolation, of scattered patrons in various stages of semiconsciousness. What do they serve in there, anyway? Must they attain some special legal waiver for added potency?\n\nMy god, how might it look this coming Saturday?\n\nSomehow, the American Northeast is about to become college-football relevant after a dormancy that could have led some to believe much of it had disbanded football operations. On Saturday, the behemoth No. 2 Clemson (9-0) will travel all the way up to Boston College (7-2), which figures to slide upward from its No. 22 spot after its win at Virginia Tech even if Virginia Tech (4-4) has slid to forlorn.\n\nOn the Saturday after that, No. 4 Notre Dame (9-0), which will occupy No. 3 by Tuesday, will come to Yankee Stadium, that architectural marvel currently owned by the Boston Red Sox. There, the Irish will find No. 19 Syracuse (7-2), which could be 8-2 if it can remember its purpose against hapless, helpless, hopeless Louisville (2-7), which just allowed 11.6 yards per play to Clemson, the most for a Clemson team since 1903, when people calculated yards-per-play by using ancient pencils.\n\n[Alabama\u2019s thrashing of LSU is an exercise in the art of domination]\n\nIt\u2019s quite something, what has transpired this fall at Syracuse which, as the Southeast has hogged more and more spotlight, had gone very forgotten in a country full of the forgotten. \u201cRegardless of whatever happens, they\u2019re going to be known as the class that got everything turned around,\u201d the third-year Coach Dino Babers said after two 4-8 seasons and after a 41-24 win at Wake Forest that followed a two-week sweep of North Carolina and North Carolina State.\n\nWhile seven wins, as Babers said, \u201cguarantees these guys a winning season, not finishing out .500 or dropping below .500 in a bowl game,\u201d one of the two losses might impress most. Remember, on Sept. 29, Syracuse led 23-13 in the fourth quarter at Clemson, and then led 23-20 with 2:50 left, and with a third-string quarterback taking Clemson\u2019s snaps.\n\nWhen he, Chase Brice, found the budding star Tee Higgins for a 20-yard gain, Clemson went on to sustain its unbeaten status and reiterate its uncommon knack for managing stress. Now Syracuse has just Louisville along the way toward major attention against Notre Dame, and with quarterback Eric Dungey warning reporters of Louisville, \u201cWe were in that position before. No one respected us,\u201d a revelation they\u2019re even mastering the cliche of the ages.\n\nAs Clemson heads to where they\u2019re sweeping up from the Red Sox parade, its four wins since Syracuse have come by a combined 240-36. Boston College quarterback Anthony Brown called Clemson \u201cprobably the best team in America,\u201d which goes to show how the northeast can be isolated as news of Alabama hasn\u2019t reached it yet. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of meat left on our bone,\u201d Brown said, a revelation they\u2019re mastering good, fresh lines.\n\n[College Football winners and losers Week 10: Michigan\u2019s mean]\n\nBoston College rambled through Virginia Tech with 24 second-half points in its 31-21 win, saddled Virginia Tech with a third straight home loss for the first time since 1992, and reminded everyone that whenever some areas brighten, others dim.\n\nIt\u2019s arithmetically inescapable.\n\nGaze away from the Northeast for a moment, and remember: \u2019Tis the season to grumble about coaches, as opposed to other times of year when people grumble about coaches. Look at all the places preparing for a spell of grumbling, some of it even irrational, for which we\u2019re all grateful. Among places which expect more than they\u2019re getting, they\u2019re about to grumble for a while about the third-year coach at Virginia Tech (4-4), the fifth-year coach at Penn State (6-3), the third-year coach at Miami (Fla.) (5-4), the fourth-year coach at Southern California (5-4), the second-year coach at Texas (6-3) and even the first-year coach at Florida (4-3), which just took a 38-17 home ransacking from a good but previously conference-winless Missouri.\n\nIn the case of Texas, it\u2019s important to take note of the happy side, which is that West Virginia\u2019s hopes all continue because Coach Dana Holgorsen shooed all human doubts and went for a winning two-point conversion twice in a row in Austin.

Tina Turner\u2019s \u201cSimply the Best\u201d blared on the loudspeakers. The iconic plane\u2019s soft blue-and-white paint shimmered in the glow of massive flood lights. A military steward opened a side door. And, voil\u00e0! The commander in chief stepped forward and waved hello.\n\n\u201cAir Force One is the best plane in the world,\u201d said John Weiler, 74, a local Republican Party officer who was downright giddy as he peered through his binoculars to bear witness. \u201cIt\u2019s known throughout the world. That plane lands, they know America has landed.\u201d\n\nFor Jerrell Lynchard, 18, a college freshman at Pensacola State College, the scene was \u201cone of those things you see in photos, but never think you\u2019ll see in real life. I got goose bumps. It was that \u2018there-it-is\u2019 moment.\u201d\n\nThere-it-is moments are what Trump has been trying to orchestrate as the showman president dashes across the country in the final days before Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections. A consummate salesman, Trump has been using Air Force One as a prop at his \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d rallies to pitch voters to keep Congress in Republican hands.\n\nThe presidential aircraft is both a raw illustration of the power of incumbency and a reminder of Trump\u2019s dominant campaign theme: strength.\n\n\u201cWe will never give in,\u201d Trump told the rapt crowd in Pensacola, his plane parked at his side. \u201cWe will never give up. We will never back down. We will never surrender. And we will always fight on to victory \u2014 always because we are America and our hearts bleed red, white and blue.\u201d\n\nTrump is hardly the first president to use Air Force One as an element of political stagecraft. For decades, presidents have held rallies on airport tarmacs \u2014 partly out of efficiency, eliminating the need for a motorcade from the airport to the arena, which saves both driving time for the president and traffic headaches for locals.\n\nBoth of Trump\u2019s immediate predecessors, Barack Obama and George W. Bush, used Air Force One at some of their rallies. Bush even arrived at a stadium during his 2004 reelection campaign aboard Marine One, with the presidential helicopter landing in the middle of a baseball field before thousands of supporters.\n\nBut Trump has been using his plane with particularly high frequency in the home stretch of the midterm campaign. It was a staging element for rallies Saturday in Pensacola and Belgrade, Mont.; Friday in Huntington, W.Va.; and Thursday in Columbia, Mo.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump and Republican Senate candidate Martha McSally arrived aboard Marine One at a rally in Mesa, Ariz., waving to the crowd as they stepped off the dramatically lit helicopter and walked onto the stage.\n\n\n\nPresident Trump speaks at a campaign rally in Columbia, Mo., on Nov. 1, 2018, with Air Force One parked behind him. (Scott Olson)\n\nTrump\u2019s use of Air Force One is raising questions about the ethics and protocol of using a military asset for political purposes. But ethics experts said there is no law preventing Trump from campaigning within view of the plane. And they note that the president, as well as the vice president, is exempt from the Hatch Act, which bars federal employees from engaging in political activity.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a question of appearance,\u201d said Richard W. Painter, ethics czar in the Bush White House and an outspoken critic of Trump\u2019s ethics practices. \u201cIt\u2019s highly inappropriate, but there\u2019s nobody who can go sanction him for standing in front of the plane to give a political speech. It\u2019s not illegal.\u201d\n\nPainter said the general protocol should be to move the plane out of view of the rally when the president does a political event on a tarmac, because it is an Air Force jet and the military is supposed to be apolitical and never endorse candidates.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a gray area,\u201d said Walter Shaub, a former director of the U.S. Office of Government Ethics and another vocal Trump critic. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly troubling to use federal property as a prop. . . . But I think you\u2019d be hard-pressed to make a case of any actual violation of law as long as they are reimbursing.\u201d\n\nThe government requires reimbursement \u2014 such as from Trump\u2019s campaign or the Republican National Committee \u2014 for costs associated with the president\u2019s travel to and from political events.\n\nThe president does not have the option of flying commercial or using his personal plane for political events. He is required to fly Air Force One for all of his travel, including vacations, because of the security and communications systems aboard.\n\nDuring the 2016 campaign, Trump used his personal Boeing 757 \u2014 branded Trump Force One \u2014 at his rallies, pulling the plane up to near the stage to great fanfare, often with the dramatic soundtrack of Harrison Ford\u2019s \u201cAir Force One\u201d movie playing.\n\nBut in February 2017, when Trump held his first airport hangar rally as president, the White House said it would not use Air Force One \u201cin the background as a prop.\u201d\n\nThat policy was clearly dropped as the president\u2019s campaigning picked up pace, however. Trump\u2019s campaign team changed the location of his rally earlier this month in Missoula, Mont., to ensure video footage and pictures of the event would feature Air Force One behind the president as he spoke, according to a report in the Missoulian newspaper.\n\nTrump\u2019s Air Force One arrivals vary by location. Usually he flies the Boeing 747 jumbo jet, with its distinctive hump at the nose, but when airport runways are not long enough to accommodate the big bird, he takes a smaller Boeing 757 model.\n\nThat was the plane in which he flew Thursday night in Columbia when an announcement was made at the Trump rally: \u201cColumbia Tower, Air Force One is on final descent.\u201d\n\nMoments later, the plane was wheels down, roaring as it zoomed past the hangar where thousands of supporters were snapping pictures and recording video on their phones. The \u201cAir Force One\u201d soundtrack played, and then Trump disembarked to the beat of Rihanna\u2019s dance anthem \u201cDon\u2019t Stop the Music.\u201d\n\nThe next day in Huntington, the crowd cheered as Air Force One approached the rally stage to the strains of John Denver\u2019s \u201cTake Me Home, Country Roads.\u201d\n\nAnd then Saturday in Montana, Air Force One landed at Bozeman Yellowstone International Airport in stunning fashion. The jet touched down against the picturesque backdrop of jagged mountains and the thunderous applause of Trump\u2019s fans.\n\n\u201cI had a tear in my eye,\u201d Isabelle Wieseler, 20. \u201cI grew up watching movies of the president and Air Force One, and this was nothing like that.

( AP Photo/Lahiru Harshana) (Associated Press)\n\nCOLOMBO, Sri Lanka \u2014 Sri Lanka\u2019s president issued an order Sunday for Parliament to reconvene on Nov. 14, when lawmakers will get the chance to hold a confidence vote on the nation\u2019s former strongman who has been named prime minister.\n\nThe announcement made in a decree comes amid a political crisis in the South Asian island nation sparked when President Maithripala Sirisena dismissed Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and his Cabinet and replaced him with Mahinda Rajapaksa last month.\n\nSirisena suspended Parliament in an apparent attempt to give Rajapaksa time to muster support to survive any no-confidence vote.\n\nPolitical opponents, rights groups and foreign governments including the United States and European Union have urged Sirisena to summon Parliament immediately and end the crisis. Thousands of Sri Lankans also protested in the capital in the past week demanding Sirisena immediately convene Parliament.\n\nSirisena\u2019s moves have triggered a power struggle that some observers have called a constitutional crisis.\n\nSince his ouster, Wickremesinghe has remained at Temple Trees, the official residence of the prime minister \u2014 insisting he is still the legitimate leader because he commands majority support in Parliament.\n\nWickremesinghe said in an interview with The Associated Press that there is credible evidence that Rajapaksa\u2019s party is attempting to buy support in Parliament.

(Calla Kessler/The Washington Post)\n\nShots rang out in Pittsburgh. And in Washington, for the first time in her life, Yael Fisher felt scared to be Jewish.\n\n\u201cI had never felt in danger because I\u2019m Jewish, physically in danger,\u201d Fisher, 22, told her friends as she picked over the remnants of their Chipotle dinner last week. \u201cI had to run an errand alone, and I was nervous. I\u2019ve never felt that before.\u201d\n\nHer three friends, all of them also 22 and Jewish, nodded gravely.\n\nHayley Berger told Fisher she remembers the day she first became aware that there are Americans who hate Jews, who hate Jews so much that they would murder. It was the day in April 2014 when a white supremacist fatally shot three people outside the Jewish Community Center and a Jewish retirement home in her Kansas suburb.\n\nReuben Siegman recalls the day he learned: He was living in St. Louis last year when a Jewish cemetery in town was vandalized. Graves were toppled again, days later, at a Jewish cemetery in Philadelphia.\n\n\u201cThat drove me to wear a kippah for a while,\u201d he told his friends. \u201cIt was like: \u2018I will be Jewish. And there\u2019s no violence you can do that will scare me away from that.\u2019 \u201d\n\nFor many young Jews across the nation, last month\u2019s mass shooting at Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh was a jarring lesson. Many millennials who grew up hearing about anti-Semitism from their parents and grandparents think of the Holocaust, Eastern European pogroms and the Spanish Inquisition when they think about violence against Jews \u2014 stories they read in history books about events that happened well over half a century ago, and all in the old country, not the United States.\n\nThe Pittsburgh rampage, committed by a gunman who reportedly shouted \u201cAll Jews must die\u201d as he fired, shattered what remained of that illusion.\n\nYoung Jews in the United States are now aware: They live in a country where anti-Semitism still lives \u2014 and where it kills.\n\nThe idea that hatred against Jews resides in the past has been fading for the past few years as anti-Semitism has reared its head repeatedly. Hate crimes have increased. In the days since the Pittsburgh shooting alone, vandals wrote \u201cF--- Jews\u201d on the wall of an Irvine, Calif., synagogue and \u201cKill All Jews\u201d inside a Brooklyn synagogue.\n\nTwitter seethes daily with anti-Semitic messages that attract billions of views. President Trump himself has been accused of anti-Semitic messaging, and when neo-Nazis marched through the streets of Charlottesville last year chanting \u201cJews will not replace us,\u201d Trump responded that there were \u201cvery fine people on both sides.\u201d\n\n[Rep. Steve King\u2019s Iowa supporters brush aside concerns about his white nationalist views]\n\nFor Gaby Kirschner, 24, the realization dawned in May of last year, when she went to a New York City protest actions of the Trump administration.\n\nShe had never been very religious; she still describes her childhood Hebrew school as \u201can old lady in a basement yelling at me after school.\u201d She learned about the Holocaust there, but she never learned that Jews had been discriminated against in the United States, barred from social, professional and educational opportunities for decades. \u201cWe were never taught this is still going on today,\u201d she said.\n\nBut on that day last May, Kirschner heard a group of pro-Trump counterprotesters shouting \u201cJew\u201d at her as she walked down the street. It happened on Twitter, too. Strangers replying to her tweets about sports, writing back, \u201cJew.\u201d She was rattled.\n\nShe went back to the religious practice she had left after her bat mitzvah at age 13. She started attending Jewish communal meetings, feeling pride in her faith: \u201cIf they want me erased, well, here I am!\u201d\n\nYet she still felt scared on the street, wondering whether a stranger looking at her might sympathize with neo-Nazis, wondering if he could read her identity right on her face. After that day at the protest, she did something else that she had been pondering previously for cosmetic reasons, and now desired for safety: She got a nose job.\n\n[Prosecutors want the death penalty for the synagogue shooter. Here's why rabbis oppose it.]\n\nFive years ago, young Jews were keenly aware of discrimination experienced by other people \u2014 and less focused on discrimination against Jews. In a major survey of American Jews conducted by Pew Research, 80 percent of respondents ages 18 to 29 said there was a lot of discrimination against Muslims, compared with 58 percent of 18-to-29-year-old Americans as a whole. Sixty-nine percent of young Jews said there was a lot of discrimination against blacks and Hispanics, compared with 50 and 57 percent of young Americans.\n\nJust 39 percent of young Jews said in 2013 that they perceived anti-Semitism as prevalent in America, according to a new analysis of the survey data by age conducted this week for The Washington Post by Pew\u2019s associate research director Greg Smith.\n\nBy 2018, Jews of the same age were far more likely to report perceiving discrimination. When the Foundation for Ethnic Understanding published a survey this year asking a diverse sample of 500 Jews and 500 Muslims about their experience of discrimination in America, Jews ages 18 to 29 were more likely than older Jews to say they had personally experienced discrimination because of their faith: 64 percent of young Jews said yes.\n\nThirty-five percent of young Jews in the survey guessed \u201cmost\u201d Americans of their faith had experienced religious discrimination, far more than the 10 percent of Jews ages 30-to 49 who answered the same way or the 13 percent of Jews older than 50 (or than Muslims of any age).\n\n['If you hate Jews, you hate Jesus too']\n\nOlder generations of Jewish Americans have told their children the stories of persecution that their ancestors fled to get to this country, whether they left Eastern Europe at the beginning of the 20th century, fled the Nazi Holocaust midcentury or came from any number of other regions of the world where Jews were in harm\u2019s way.\n\nBut American anti-Semitism \u2014 the quotas restricting Jews\u2019 entrance to certain universities, the neighborhoods where Jews were unwelcome, the organizational discrimination that kept Jews out of hotels and summer camps until they created their own \u2014 all of that very rarely makes it into Hebrew school curriculums.\n\nSo millennials tend to think of anti-Semitism as an old problem, and a European one.\n\n\u201cMy understanding of anti-Semitism was I thought about the Holocaust my grandparents experienced. I hadn\u2019t necessarily thought about it in the context of the modern day,\u201d said Gaby Joseph, 24. That changed when Joseph was studying abroad in Copenhagen in 2015, and a gunman killed a guard outside a synagogue there. Police suspected he was influenced by the terrorists who killed shoppers in a kosher grocery store in Paris the month before.\n\n\u201cI felt honestly a little naive, as the granddaughter of Holocaust survivors, that I could be shocked by something like this,\u201d Joseph said.\n\nShe emailed her grandfather from her study abroad program, telling him how distraught she was by the shooting. He replied with just one line, she said: \u201cIt\u2019s hard being a Jew.\u201d\n\nSuddenly she saw how different her perception of anti-Semitism was than his, how safe she had always felt as a Jew in a world where he felt imperiled.\n\nLast week, before she packed into the crowded sanctuary at Adas Israel synagogue in Northwest Washington to pay tribute to the people killed in Pittsburgh, she opened up that one-line email once more. Again, it felt like a gut punch.\n\n[When your childhood synagogue becomes a horror scene]\n\nFor others, it hit home for the first time watching the news after the Pittsburgh attack. \u201cWatching the news the other day was the first time I ever cried in front of the news,\u201d said Corey Teich, 27.\n\nHe was sickened by the discourse that the Pittsburgh shooter allegedly read and embraced \u2014 the attitude, spread online, that Jews are outsiders who are undermining American society.\n\n\u201cI so rarely ever thought about it. You know the word \u2018anti-Semitism.\u2019 You know about the Holocaust. You read about it in Hebrew school,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know it\u2019s happened in history. You know that theoretically it\u2019s possible. But you never think about it, because you feel safe \u2014 probably so did the people who lived in Squirrel Hill.\u201d\n\nHis Jewish identity lies in bagels and lox and Seinfeld; he rarely attends a synagogue, he said. But he found himself feeling an urge he couldn\u2019t quite explain this week, to put on his chai necklace \u2014 the Hebrew word for \u201clife.\u201d\n\nThe prejudice, he said, is \u201cmore prevalent and more real\u201d than he ever knew. \u201cIt definitely makes me prouder to be who I am, because there are some people who want to take that away.\u201d\n\nFor the young adults eating takeout Chipotle near Dupont Circle on Thursday night, the next day loomed large \u2014 the first Shabbat since the massacre at Tree of Life would begin at sundown Friday. Jews around the world issued calls to \u201cshow up for Shabbat,\u201d inviting Jews and non-Jews alike to gather in synagogues.\n\nThese four young people, participants in the Jewish service corps Avodah, planned to host 30 guests at the home where they live during their one-year commitment to work in social service jobs. They hoped to offer solace to people in mourning. They hoped they could cook enough food.\n\nFor Fisher, the reality of the hatred outside their close-knit circle couldn\u2019t quite sink in. She told her friends she had been reading statistics published by the Anti-Defamation League showing the largest one-year increase ever recorded in anti-Semitic incidents in the United States.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s crazy. I don\u2019t feel like I have ever encountered that directly,\u201d she said. \u201cObviously, it exists \u2014 but where is it?\u201d\n\nShe paused. Now, they all knew the answer.\n\n\u201cIn Pittsburgh.\u201d", "\n\nMichael Cohen, President Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer, leaves federal court in New York on Aug. 21 after reaching a plea agreement. (AP Photo/Craig Ruttle, File)\n\nOpinion writer\n\nVanity Fair reported Friday that President Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer Michael Cohen said Trump made blatantly racist comments to him from time to time.\n\nAccording to Cohen, Trump remarked in response to Cohen\u2019s observation that his rally crowds were overwhelmingly white, \u201cThat\u2019s because black people are too stupid to vote for me.\u201d Cohen also claims Trump said, \u201cName one country run by a black person that\u2019s not a shithole. . . . Name one city.\u201d Cohen also recalls that while traveling in Chicago in a rough neighborhood, Trump said, \u201conly the blacks could live like this.\u201d (When someone says \u201cthe\u201d blacks or \u201cthe\u201d Hispanics, it\u2019s generally not going to be a compliment.)\n\nThis will come as a total shock to you unless you knew:\n\n(And then there are the racist remarks and policies about Muslims and Hispanics.)\n\nIf, however, you\u2019ve been a sentient being for a couple years, you\u2019ve also noticed that in addition to all that Trump praises \u201cnationalism,\u201d refuses to condemn the alt-right and has no trouble embracing out-and-out racists (e.g., Roy Moore, who said, \u201cI think it was great at the time when families were united \u2014 even though we had slavery. They cared for one another. People were strong in the families. Our families were strong. Our country had a direction\u201d).\n\nIf you didn\u2019t think he was a racist \u2014 or didn\u2019t care that he was \u2014 you\u2019ll wave off Cohen\u2019s allegations as untrue or irrelevant. If, however, you\u2019ve figured out and been proved right in the closing days of the midterm campaign that Trump is obsessed with whipping up racist animosity and stoking white grievance, you\u2019ll believe Cohen\u2019s allegations are entirely plausible.\n\nSo does this mean Cohen\u2019s accusations are not important or worthy of reporting? No. The measure of newsworthiness for a president\u2019s outlandish words or conduct, contrary to fuzzy-headed punditry, is not whether something changes minds or \u201cworks,\u201d but rather whether it is deliberately false, outside the bounds of decent conduct, violates basic democratic norms, provides comfort to despots around the globe, evidences corrupt intent and/or signifies unfitness in office. Honestly, just about everything the commander in chief says is newsworthy; he is arguably the most powerful person on the planet.\n\nIt\u2019s perverse to say that because Trump evidences overt racism more than any post-World War II president we should start ignoring his outbursts. (And in an election in which both sides are trying to motivate every last voter, one never knows what will provoke someone to vote or, alternatively, to stay home out of disgust for the conduct of one\u2019s favored party.)\n\nSimilarly, the press cannot ignore tweets even if coverage is \u201cwhat Trump wants.\u201d Whether coverage serves to annoy or satisfy Trump\u2019s gargantuan ego is not journalists\u2019 concern. We are obliged to track Trump\u2019s lies, if only to remind Americans of the difference between truth and fiction and to trace the pace of his lies. (My Post colleagues Glenn Kessler, Salvador Rizzo and Meg Kelly this past week found, \u201cIn the first nine months of his presidency, Trump made 1,318 false or misleading claims, an average of five a day. But in the seven weeks leading up the midterm elections, the president made 1,419 false or misleading claims \u2014 an average of 30 a day.\u201d)\n\nThe independent media\u2019s job is to illuminate and inform, to present the truth as best as we are able. What voters choose to make of it is up to them. Whether it \u201chelps\u201d one side or the other is the concern of partisan propagandists, not journalists.", "\n\nNorth Ogden, Utah, Mayor Brent Taylor was killed in Afghanistan on Saturday.

It is a largely peaceful procession, though some migrants in one caravan clashed with Mexico police, hurling stones.\n\nAlthough the caravan is still some 1,200 kilometers (800 miles) from the border, Trump has mobilized troops and declared that if U.S. soldiers face rock-throwing migrants, they should react as though the rocks were \u201crifles.\u201d\n\nTrump later said he was merely calling for the arrests of stone throwers.\n\nBut following Trump\u2019s comments, Nigeria\u2019s military sent out a tweet that appeared to use his words as justification for shooting and killing Shiite protesters. It later removed the tweet.\n\nOmar Shakir, the Israel-Palestine director of the international group Human Rights Watch, said he fears Trump\u2019s comments could encourage other forces to loosen their rules of engagement.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s brazen, inflammatory statements, days before U.S. midterm elections, have already been seized on by rights abusers to justify more expansive open fire standards,\u201d he said.\n\nHere is a look at how countries around the world respond to stone throwers.\n\nISRAEL/PALESTINIANS:\n\nIsraeli forces have been confronting Palestinian stone throwers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip for decades. Israeli tactics have evolved over the years, particularly with the increased use of what are presented as non-lethal crowd-dispersal tools such as tear gas and rubber bullets.\n\nIsraeli officials say that live fire is used only as a last resort, when soldiers\u2019 lives are threatened. But critics accuse Israel of unnecessarily, and perhaps illegally, using deadly force.\n\nIn recent months, for instance, over 160 Palestinians have been killed during mass protests along Gaza\u2019s border with Israel. Many have been unarmed.\n\nIsrael says threats go beyond stone throwing, and that protesters throw grenades and firebombs, or try to break through the border to attack Israeli civilians.\n\nDavid Tzur, a former commander of Israel\u2019s paramilitary Border Police, said non-lethal force is sufficient in most cases, but that troops could be justified using live fire in more chaotic situations, if a moving vehicle is pelted with stones in a tense locale, for instance.\n\nGREECE:\n\nIn Greece, firebombs and stone-throwing are routine occurrences at anarchist demonstrations held on most weekends. Police typically respond with tear gas and stun grenades to disperse the crowds.\n\nIn 2008, a policeman fired his gun at a group of youths in central Athens, killing a 15-year-old protester. The death sparked two weeks of riots in major cities across Greece, and the policeman was jailed for murder.\n\nMIGRANTS IN EUROPE:\n\nMigrants making their way to Europe have clashed with security forces in various countries.\n\nIn Spain, migrants from Africa have on several occasions stormed across the border, assaulting police officers with acid, skin irritants and other objects.\n\nBut police are not permitted to use live ammunition and have not even used rubber bullets against migrants since a much-criticized crackdown in 2014. Spanish police did use rubber bullets last year in clashes with Catalan separatists.\n\nHungary, which takes one of the hardest lines against migrants, used only tear gas and water cannons in a major clash with migrants three years ago. One Syrian migrant, however, was sentenced to five years in prison on terrorism charges for entering the country illegally and throwing stones at police.\n\nKASHMIR:\n\nIn Indian-administered Kashmir, a disputed territory divided between India and Pakistan, protesters have long viewed stone throwing as legitimate protest against Indian rule.\n\nIndia has often responded with tough measures, including live fire and metal pellets that have killed, maimed or blinded hundreds of people over the last decade. India says its troops are in life-threatening situations that justify the heavy use of force.\n\nProtesters caught throwing stones at soldiers and police \u2014 often identified through video recordings of demonstrations \u2014 are usually accused of attempting to murder government officials, a charge that carries long imprisonment. Many stone throwers have been shot dead by soldiers.\n\nRebels have been fighting Indian control since 1989. Nearly 70,000 people have been killed in the uprising and the ensuing Indian military crackdown.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Aijaz Hussain in Srinigar, India; Elena Becatoros in Athens; Thomas Adamson in Paris; Pablo Gorondi in Budapest, Hungary; Joseph Wilson in Barcelona, Spain, and Aron Heller in Jerusalem contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

General Assembly in New York on Sept 25, 2018. (Darren Ornitz/Reuters)\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo predicted Sunday that the remaining sanctions against Iran that resume Monday will change the Tehran government\u2019s behavior in the region.\n\nSpeaking on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d Pompeo said the sanctions \u2014 the last ones to snap back after the U.S. withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal \u2014 aim to get Tehran to stop supporting militants in the Middle East, stop testing missiles and treat its own citizens with more respect. And he defended President Trump\u2019s tweet Friday featuring a\u201cGame of Thrones\u201d-inspired poster that warned: \u201cSanctions Are Coming.\u201d\n\nPompeo said that Trump was \u201cputting the world on notice that the terror regime which threatens Israel through Iranian funding of Lebanese Hezbollah, that the terror regime that attempted to conduct an assassination in Denmark over that past few weeks, that the terror regime that continues to fund Houthis launching missiles into Riyadh and into Dubai, that\u2019s going to stop. That behavior must change, and sanctions of the United States will be reimposed at midnight tonight.\u201d\n\nAsked what the administration would do if the Iranians restart their nuclear program, Pompeo replied, \u201cWe\u2019re confident that Iranians will not make that decision.\u201d\n\n[U.S. lowers the sanctions boom on Iran, again]\n\nSunday marks the end of a 180-day deadline the United States set before the second round of sanctions lifted under the 2015 deal were to resume. Although the sanctions are against the financial and shipping sectors, the most significant measures prohibit purchases of Iranian oil, which provides 80 percent of Tehran\u2019s tax revenue.\n\nStarting Monday, all countries and businesses that buy oil from Iran risk secondary sanctions from the United States, and the administration has vowed to pursue offenders aggressively. Virtually all multinational companies that had started doing business in Iran after sanctions were suspended in 2016 have pulled out. That has helped send the Iranian rial plummeting and hurt ordinary Iranians amid spiraling prices of basic goods.\n\n[A foiled assassination plot in Denmark may have just cost Iran a partner against Trump]\n\nBut only a handful of countries support the U.S. action, and Iranian officials have said that the reimposed sanctions underscore how isolated the United States is. Many Middle East analysts also are skeptical that Iran will change its behavior in any way, in a show of defiance.\n\nOn \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d Pompeo defended the administration\u2019s decision to grant temporary waivers on oil sanctions to eight nations, including some of Iran\u2019s biggest oil customers.\n\nThe secretary of state has not named the countries, though Turkey has said it has received notice and is among them. China, South Korea, Japan and India also are expected to get waivers. Pompeo said all had made significant reductions in their Iran oil purchases already but \u201cneed a little bit more time to get to zero.\u201d\n\nPompeo also said the troops going to the southern U.S. border are intended to keep a caravan of migrants from entering the country illegally, but he suggested the migrants may be allowed to enter if they apply through the proper channels.\n\n\u201cIf they want to come here lawfully, that\u2019s the American tradition, it\u2019s the American way,\u201d he said on CBS News\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u201cWe continue to be the most generous nation in the world with respect to immigration. But illegal immigration will not be permitted.\u201d\n\nHe also said the United States is still seeking to identify everyone involved in the killing of Washington Post contributing columnist Jamal Khashoggi, who was killed last month in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. But Pompeo also said the incident will not be allowed to harm U.S.-Saudi relations.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working with the Turkish government, with the Saudi government and with anyone else who has relevant facts for us to be able to determine all of those who were responsible for this atrocious murder of Jamal Khashoggi, which the Saudis themselves have acknowledged was premeditated,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to get to the bottom of it. We need to find out who was responsible, hold them accountable.\n\n\u201cAnd do all of this while protecting enormously important strategic interests that the United maintains with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\u201d\n\nAsked what the administration will do if Crown Prince Mohammed bin Sultan is found to have ordered Khashoggi\u2019s killing, Pompeo said, \u201cWe are going to chase the facts wherever they go, and we hold accountable each of those who we find responsible.\u201d", "COLOMBO, Sri Lanka \u2014 Sri Lankan president orders Parliament to reconvene Nov. 14 for confidence vote on ex-strongman named prime minister.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Irish Deputy Prime Minister Simon Coveney said \u201cI think it is possible to get a deal in November.\u201d\n\nBritain is due to leave the EU on March 29, but London and Brussels have not reached an agreement on their divorce terms and a smooth transition to a new relationship. The stalemate has heightened fears that the U.K. might leave without a deal in place, leading to chaos at ports and economic turmoil.\n\nAn October EU summit that had been billed as the deadline for a breakthrough ended with the talks still deadlocked.\n\nThe key obstacle is the Irish border, which will be the U.K.\u2019s only land frontier with the EU after Brexit. Britain and the EU agree there must be no customs posts or other barriers that could disrupt businesses and residents on either side or undermine Northern Ireland\u2019s hard-won peace process.\n\nBut the two sides have not agreed on how to do that. Britain rejected the EU\u2019s proposal \u2014 to keep Northern Ireland in a customs union with the bloc \u2014 because it would impose new customs and regulatory checks between Northern Ireland and the rest of the U.K.\n\nAccording to the Sunday Times, a proposed solution would keep all the U.K. in a customs union \u2014 but with an exit clause to mollify pro-Brexit British lawmakers who worry the U.K. will be bound to the EU forever.\n\nMay faces a battle to get a deal approved by her Cabinet \u2014 which is split between supporters of a clean break with the EU and those who want to keep close economic ties to the bloc \u2014 and past an equally divided Parliament.\n\nMay has already lost two top ministers, Boris Johnson and David Davis, over her Brexit blueprint. Others could follow in a bid to make her change course. And pro-Brexit Conservative lawmakers have openly mulled attempting to oust May with a no-confidence vote and a party leadership contest.\n\nSo far, the prime minister has stood her ground and her opponents have blinked.\n\nWith the clock ticking, opponents of Brexit are stepping up efforts to secure a new referendum on whether to accept any deal agreed between Britain and the bloc.\n\nBritain voted in 2016 to leave the EU, but some argue the public should get a second chance to decide once the shape of the U.K.\u2019s future relations with the bloc is clear.\n\nMore than 70 British business leaders signed a letter published Sunday urging a second vote, arguing that the conditions proposed by the government for associating with the EU after Brexit are \u201cnot nearly as good as the current deal we have inside the EU.\u201d\n\nSignatories included James Daunt, chief executive of the Waterstones book store chain, former Sainsbury\u2019s supermarket CEO Justin King and Martha Lane-Fox, founder of Lastminute.com.\n\nMeanwhile, one of the main funders of the successful pro-Brexit side in the 2016 referendum is facing a criminal investigation.\n\nThe National Crime Agency is investigating insurance tycoon Arron Banks after electoral officials alleged that 8 million pounds ($10.4 million) he funneled to a pro-Brexit group might have come from outside the U.K., in violation of election laws.\n\nA British parliamentary committee is also investigating Banks\u2019 role in the referendum and his meetings with Russian officials.\n\nBanks denied wrongdoing Sunday, accusing anti-Brexit politicians and journalists of pursuing a \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d against him.\n\n\u201cThe money came from a U.K.-registered company ... generated from businesses in the U.K.,\u201d Banks told the BBC.\n\n\u201cThere was no Russian money and no interference of any type,\u201d he said.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(The Gazette via AP)\n\nAurora, a 22-year-old gyrfalcon that serves as one of the Air Force Academy\u2019s mascots, is improving from serious injuries it suffered during a prank by Army cadets for which the U.S. Military Academy has apologized.\n\nThe injuries, which the Colorado Springs Gazette reports were to both of the bird\u2019s wings, were suffered before the service academies' annual rivalry game Saturday in West Point, N.Y., and occurred when it was taken from an Army colonel\u2019s home, an unnamed Air Force representative told the Gazette. The bird was being sent back to Colorado for evaluation and treatment by specialists. As of Sunday evening, Aurora had improved and \u201cwas able to fly around in her pen,\u201d Air Force Academy spokeswoman Lt. Col. Tracy A. Bunko told the Associated Press.

We are taking this situation very seriously.\u201d\n\nSam Dollar, the Air Force\u2019s falconry team adviser, told The New York Times that two West Point cadets took Aurora, the team\u2019s official mascot, and Oblio, a younger Peregrine falcon, threw sweaters over them and put them into dog crates. They surrendered the birds Saturday morning and Aurora\u2019s wings were bloodied, possibly because the bird thrashed inside the crate.\n\nAurora is, as the Gazette puts it, the oldest of the Air Force\u2019s half-dozen or so falcons and has traveled with cadets for more than 20 years. Aurora\u2019s two-inch talons make the bird difficult to handle if upset and Aurora, according to the Associated Press, is temperamental. She does not perform at games. She does, though, fly for exercise over the academy\u2019s athletic fields. These gyrfalcons typically live around 25 years in captivity.\n\n\u201cI think they had them for a couple hours and then they realized it was a bad mistake,\u201d Dollar said. \u201cWhen Aurora started thrashing around in the crate, they decided that wasn\u2019t a good thing.\u201d\n\nThe falcons are guarded at the school and have an assigned guardian cadet when they travel. Wrangling them can be difficult and they have, at times, escaped. Before the 2010 Independence Bowl, a falcon took off and was later found in downtown Shreveport, La.\n\nBecause of the bird\u2019s injuries, Air Force had only one falcon at the game, which Army won, 17-14. There\u2019s a long history of pranks involving the service academies and their football rivalries, Navy and Army getting the most attention. The midshipmen reportedly once took Army mules and cadets took one of the Naval Academy\u2019s goats.\n\n\u201cWe are taking this situation very seriously, and this occurrence does not reflect the Army or U.S.M.A. core values of dignity and respect,\u201d the West Point statement added.\n\nAurora is a white phase gyrfalcon, a species \u201cthat is extremely rare in the wild and whose beauty will take your breath away,\u201d Dollar said.

President Donald Trump insists his new North American trade deal will deliver a victory for U.S. factory workers by returning many high-paying jobs to the United States. Maybe. But a review of the agreement suggests that job gains for the U.S. would likely mean higher prices for consumers and more inefficiencies for businesses.

(Pablo Martinez Monsivais, File/Associated Press)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump insists his new North American trade deal will deliver a victory for U.S. factory workers by returning many high-paying jobs to the United States.\n\nMaybe. But a review of the agreement suggests that it could also mean higher prices for consumers and more inefficiencies for businesses. And the biggest winners might end up being robots and the companies that make them.\n\nAs Americans vote in the midterm elections, Trump is heralding the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement as a triumph for his antagonistic trade policy \u2014 an approach that he says will usher in \u201ca new dawn for the American auto industry and the American auto worker.\u201d\n\nThe pact, unveiled Sept. 30, does appear to meet some of Trump\u2019s goals: It could shift more factory production to the United States, thereby reversing a long-standing flow of jobs to lower-wage Mexico. And it could result in better working conditions and perhaps higher pay for Mexico\u2019s long-suffering laborers.\n\nBut shifting away from a business model that relies on Mexican labor would likely mean higher-priced cars for American consumers. And North America\u2019s automakers could become less competitive compared with rivals in Europe and Asia.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be harder to keep North America competitive as a manufacturing hub,\u201d said Michael McAdoo of the Boston Consulting Group.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, much of the manufacturing work that does return to the United States would likely be done by robots in America\u2019s increasingly automated plants, not by human workers.\n\nThe deal \u2014 known by its acronym, USMCA \u2014 is meant to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement. Trump had long condemned the 24-year-old NAFTA as a killer of American jobs. He even banished its name once the new deal was struck.\n\nNAFTA had erased most trade barriers separating the United States, Canada and Mexico. Trade among the three surged. But many U.S. manufacturers moved factories and jobs to Mexico to capitalize on cheaper labor. Those manufacturers could then ship cars and other goods back to the United States and Canada, duty-free.\n\nTrump demanded a new deal more favorable to American workers. Negotiations began in August 2017 and eventually produced USMCA.\n\n\u201cThese measures will support many hundreds of thousands of American jobs,\u201d Trump declared early last month.\n\nUSMCA isn\u2019t a done deal. It has yet to be signed by the leaders or ratified by the legislatures of the three countries. Some Democrats have expressed support for the pact. But if their party regains control of the U.S. House in Tuesday\u2019s elections, it\u2019s far from clear that its leaders would want to hand Trump a victory.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Canadian and Mexican lawmakers might think twice about ratifying the deal unless Trump frees them from the import taxes he\u2019s imposed on steel and aluminum in a separate dispute.\n\nTo qualify for duty-free benefits, USMCA requires carmakers to acquire 75 percent of auto content from within North America \u2014 up from 62.5 percent under NAFTA. That means more content would have to be homegrown in higher-wage North America, not imported more cheaply from elsewhere.\n\nAt least 40 percent of vehicles would also have to originate in places where workers earn at least $16 an hour. That would likely benefit the United States or Canada \u2014 not Mexico, where auto assembly workers earn an average of just $7.34 an hour and parts workers $3.41 an hour.\n\nGladys Cisneros of the AFL-CIO\u2019s Solidarity Center, which advocates for unions, said she doubts the $16-an-hour wage requirement would do much for Mexican workers.\n\n\u201cNot a single auto parts or auto assembly plant pays that much\u201d in Mexico, Cisneros said. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to get them ... to $16 anytime soon.\u201d\n\nTony Payan, director of the Mexico Center at Rice University\u2019s Baker Institute for Public Policy, noted that for years Mexican governments sought to keep wages low to give their country a competitive edge.\n\n\u201cMost American leaders understood that,\u201d Payan said. \u201cThey simply didn\u2019t address it because it was good for business. Cheap labor was good for business.\u201d\n\nBut President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who takes office Dec. 1, wants to reform Mexican labor practices and raise wages.\n\n\u201cWhat Trump is finding here is a more receptive environment in Mexico to do exactly what he wants Mexico to do,\u201d Payan said\n\nUnder USMCA, Mexico is supposed to formally authorize workers to form independent unions. Mexican unions have traditionally been co-opted by employers and the government and done little for workers. Laborers have been fired for trying to bargain on their own for better pay and working conditions.\n\nA weak labor movement is one reason NAFTA didn\u2019t much help Mexicans despite the influx of jobs there. A study by the Colegio de Mexico found that the wage gap between the U.S. and Mexico actually widened under NAFTA. U.S. autoworkers made 5.4 times as much as their Mexican counterparts in 1994. By 2016, they were earning 9.1 times more.\n\nUnder NAFTA, workers were represented by \u201cbogus trade unions \u2014 very corrupt,\u201d said Jesus Seade, who represented the incoming Lopez Obrador administration in the USMCA talks. \u201cNow, all that is going out the window.\u201d\n\nWell, maybe. Foreign Relations Secretary Luis Videgaray told The Associated Press that the agreement doesn\u2019t oblige Mexico to do much beyond implementing a vague constitutional amendment requiring workers to have a say in labor contracts.\n\nWhether conditions truly improve for Mexican workers depends on whether the Lopez Obrador administration pursues \u201crobust and really thoughtful labor reform that allows workers to collectively bargain,\u201d Cisneros said.\n\nIn the meantime, businesses are studying the agreement to determine what it could mean for their operations and supply chains.\n\nSome companies may move operations from Mexico to the United States. Others might decide that the USMCA\u2019s duty-free benefits aren\u2019t worth the cost of complying with the 75 percent North American content requirement and producing more cars in higher-wage factories. And they have an alternative: They can ignore USMCA rules and just absorb the 2.5 percent car tariff that most countries pay to export to the United States under World Trade Organization rules.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether those companies could continue to pay only the 2.5 percent WTO tariff should Trump carry out a threat to impose tariffs of 20 percent to 25 percent on all autos imported to the United States. The U.S. and Mexico agreed that 2.6 million Mexican cars would be exempt from any such auto tariffs. But whether these exemptions would apply to cars that failed to meet USMCA standards isn\u2019t clear.\n\nIn such ways, the new trade pact \u2014 and any corporate maneuvering to bypass its requirements \u2014 could raise manufacturing costs in North America and put its factories at a disadvantage to Asian and European rivals.\n\n\u201cCompanies are evaluating where they can produce competitively in order to access emerging markets in Asia, South America and elsewhere,\u201d Chad Bown, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, wrote in an assessment of the deal. \u201cClunky new rules and higher costs make America, Mexico and Canada a considerably less attractive hub.\u201d\n\nEven if the new pact does help return some production to the United States, it\u2019s unclear that it would produce many jobs. America\u2019s factories are increasingly automated.\n\n\u201cThe United States continues to be a manufacturing powerhouse, but manufacturing jobs are increasingly rare,\u201d said Rice\u2019s Payan. \u201cRobots are doing the work.\u201d\n\nAfter studying USMCA, in fact, investment strategists at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute predicted that \u201cthe long-term winners will be companies in the automation and robotics space.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Paul Wiseman on Twitter at https://twitter.com/PaulWisemanAP\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

He dismissed that the notion the state had endured a historic dry spell and threatened to withhold federal funding.\n\n\u201cCalifornia, get on the ball,\u201d Trump concluded. \u201cBecause we\u2019re not going to hand you any more money.\u201d\n\nFor many, Trump\u2019s commentary was just another off-the-cuff mischaracterization. Of course, scientists say, California suffered through a drought \u2014 one of its worst ever on record.\n\nTrump\u2019s speech was just small part of a deluge of activity from the president and his deputies in recent months aimed at eventually delivering more water to farms in California\u2019s Central Valley \u2014 and, in the near term, buoying the prospects of Republicans here running for reelection in Tuesday\u2019s midterms.\n\nFor decades, farmers in the Central Valley have found themselves knotted in a tug-of-war with coastal residents over how much of California\u2019s finite water supply should be divided among sating city dwellers, supplying habitat for river critters and cultivating crops. The drought emergency, which Gov. Jerry Brown (D) only official declared over in 2017, made those tensions worse.\n\nWith California\u2019s state government firmly controlled by urban Democrats, California\u2019s almond, walnut, dairy and grape producers have increasingly turned to the federal government for help after Republicans took the White House in 2017.\n\nAs if on cue, Trump waded into the debate last month during his speech by singling out an endangered fish \u2014 the three-inch delta smelt \u2014 for ridicule because California wanted to divert water from the Central Valley to protect it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s doing very poorly,\u201d Trump said last month. \u201cNobody knows what a smelt is. I still don\u2019t know what a smelt is.\u201d\n\nWith Republicans holding about a half-dozen vulnerable seats in California, according to the Cook Political Report, Democrats believe their path to recapturing the House runs, like San Joaquin and Sacramento rivers that have made the Central Valley into an agricultural powerhouse, right through the Golden State.\n\nNo Republican incumbent here in California\u2019s fruit-and-nut basket is more vulnerable to the gush of Democratic enthusiasm than Jeff Denham.\n\nThe four-term farmer-turned-congressman is running in a district Hillary Clinton won by three points in 2016. Denham\u2019s opponent, a \u201cMedicare-for-all\u201d Democrat named Josh Harder, is trying to tie the incumbent to Trump on issues like health care and immigration.\n\nThat Democratic message may be finding an audience here in this sunny corner of the San Joaquin Valley. A New York Times-Siena College survey in late October showed that 47 percent of residents support Harder while 45 percent back Denham. The poll\u2019s sample size of 501 likely voters carries a margin of error of nearly 5 points, suggesting either candidate can win on Tuesday.\n\nNo resource is more vital to livelihoods in California\u2019s 10th district than water. On that issue, Harder is hard to distinguish from his opponent.\n\nBoth Denham and Harder oppose a state plan to flush more water down Central Valley rivers to help sustain endangered river fish. Both also oppose another proposal to construct two massive tunnels under the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta to deliver water to points south, including Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cWater is a bipartisan issue,\u201d Harder told The Washington Post in an interview. For a century, he said, Republicans and Democrats here have worked \u201ctogether to make sure that the valley has enough water.\u201d\n\nIn a debate in September, Denham conceded as much: \u201cThere\u2019s not a more critical question than the future of our water here. And Josh is right, this is not a partisan issue for us here in the Valley.\u201d (The Denham campaign declined to make the congressman available for an interview.)\n\nBut ahead of the election it has been California\u2019s Republican delegation in Congress that has marshaled the power of the federal government to try to bring more water to the Central Valley.\n\nIn October, 18 days before Election Day, Trump pledged to \u201celiminate all unnecessary burdens\u201d on water supply in California and other Western states. The president signed a memorandum telling federal agencies to find regulations to cut and to swiftly approve environmental reviews for the canals and dams that supply water to the Central Valley.\n\nStanding next to Trump during the signing ceremony were five California House Republicans, including Denham.\n\n\n\nMexican immigrants haul out water hoses on a sweet potato farm in California's 10th Congressional District. (Mario Tama/Getty Images)\n\nDeputy Secretary of the Interior David Bernhardt hailed that move as \u201cthe most significant action taken by a president on Western water issues in my lifetime\u201d during a conference call with reporters explaining the directive.\n\nBut some water-policy experts see Trump\u2019s move more as politics than policy, as any action taken by the federal government won\u2019t come until after the election.\n\n\u201cIt was completely designed purely to throw a bone to the Central Valley competitive congressional races,\u201d said Peter Gleick, a hydrologist and founder of the Pacific Institute.\n\nStill, many farmers here in Stanislaus and San Joaquin counties, where irrigation canals and county roads crisscross cow pastures and stone-fruit groves for miles on end, are happy with any help they can get.\n\n\u201cFinally, after all these years he passed through a mandate to provide water infrastructure in the Western United States,\u201d said David Phippen, a third-generation almond grower in Manteca who supports Denham. \u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting a long time for that.\u201d\n\nThe latest water struggle involves the California State Water Resources Control Board, which is set to decide whether to allow more water to flow through the San Joaquin River and its tributaries.\n\nWith freshwater more plentiful now that the Sierra Nevada have been replenished with snow, the plan is to provide more cool and quick-running water downstream to stave off the collapse of the chinook salmon and three-inch delta smelt. But farmers fear it would leave them with less water to grow crops. The five-member panel will vote on the plan one day after Election Day.\n\nIn the midst of the controversy, Trump is staying away from nail-biter races like Denham\u2019s, where his presence may hurt rather than help.\n\nInstead, Denham helped bring three Trump Cabinet officials \u2014 Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue and acting Environmental Protection Agency chief Andrew Wheeler \u2014 to the Central Valley in recent months to tour reservoirs and talk with growers.\n\nDuring a visit to the Don Pedro Reservoir in July, Zinke praised the congressman\u2019s \u201cgreat leadership\u201d on water issues.\n\nThe visits prompted both Interior and the EPA to later send California\u2019s water board letters questioning whether allowing more downstream flows is legal or even if it would help dwindling fish populations.\n\nAlmond farmers like Phippen, who oppose what they call the state\u2019s \u201cwater grab,\u201d are sensitive to perceptions that they grow a thirsty crop. During the height of the drought California\u2019s almond industry lamented what became an oft-heard statistic: That it takes about one gallon of water to produce a single almond.\n\nWhile riding around his sprawling 70-employee farm, which processes about 35 million pounds of almonds every year, Phippen noted that the nearly four-story tall mounds of almond hulls stored in an open-air barn will not go to waste.\n\nGesturing to a semi being loaded with hulls, Phippen said, \u201cTomorrow morning, it\u2019ll be milk.\u201d The outer coverings were on their way to be fed to dairy cows.\n\nBob and Margo Cushing, almond ranchers about 20 miles to the east, emphasized what they and others see as an even greater threat: The Brown administration\u2019s proposal to construct two massive tunnels under the delta to bring water south.\n\nThe Cushings, however, back Harder. They and other supporters of the Democratic nominee fret over Denham\u2019s vote in favor of an appropriations bill that included a prohibition against any lawsuits being brought against the controversial tunnels.\n\n\u201cThat didn\u2019t help us at all,\u201d Bob Cushing said while leaning against his John Deere Gator at his 11,000-tree orchard in Oakdale outfitted with low-volume sprinklers between trees to conserve water.\n\nThe Denham campaign counters by casting Harder, a former venture capitalist, as \u201cBay Area Harder\u201d after he failed to attend a Sacramento rally against the state\u2019s \u201cwater grab.\u201d\n\nThe Republican\u2019s camp also tried to use Harder\u2019s endorsement from the League of Conservation Voters, which is spending about $100,000 in get-out-the-vote efforts for Harder, against him after the group derided Trump\u2019s water memo as \u201ca political stunt.\u201d\n\nBut the coup de grace for Denham was Trump\u2019s signature in October on a water infrastructure bill the congressman helped write. The bill authorized financing for new water storage projects across the Western United States. Again, Denham stood at Trump\u2019s side while signing.\n\nHarder derided the bill as \u201cgrandstanding,\u201d saying it \u201cdoesn\u2019t appropriate a single dollar of federal funding for any water project.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bill that you can go home a week before election and tell people you did something,\u201d Harder said.\n\nBut the farming establishment here in Stanislaus and San Joaquin counties, thrilled to finally see the federal government taking their concerns seriously, is sticking with Denham. The counties' two farm bureaus both back the incumbent.\n\nFarm owners are not the only ones who depend on water. Much of the Hispanic community here, which makes up 40 percent of the district\u2019s population according to the 2010 Census, works in agriculture.\n\n\u201cIf we can get them to vote, that\u2019s our biggest challenge,\u201d said Guadalupe Villarreal, a retired walnut farmer and Harder supporter. \u201cA lot of these people don\u2019t typically vote.\u201d\n\nAt an intersection down the road from Phippen\u2019s almond operation, a half-dozen Democratic campaign volunteers stood in the late-day sun to wave pro-Harder signs, some of which were emblazoned with water towers.\n\n\u201cWater is not an issue in a lot of places,\u201d said Kathi Fotinos, a retired nurse campaigning that day. \u201cBut we\u2019ve gone from one drought to the next.\u201d\n\nSuddenly, a motorist gave an indication that Harder\u2019s message on water was breaking through.\n\nOut of the window of a passing pickup truck a woman yelled: \u201cSave our water! Vote for Josh Harder!\"\n\nJuliet Eilperin contributed to this report.", "COMBO - This combination of two pictures shows U.S. President Donald Trump, left, on July 22, 2018, and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Feb. 6, 2018.

(Dan Anderson/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\nPresident Trump talks about the economy. The question is: Why does he talk about anything else?\n\nWhether Trump deserves complete credit for it, the economy is strong. The unemployment rate in October remained steady at 3.7 percent, a 50-year low, and consumer confidence this year hit an 18-year high.\n\nAmericans' optimism about the economy is the highest it has been in two decades, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll released Sunday. About two-thirds of all Americans rate the economy as good or excellent, as do 71 percent of registered voters.\n\nWith a nail-biter election days away, most presidents would only be talking about that. Trump is not any president.\n\nReporting on the new poll results, Washington Post reporters Dan Balz and Scott Clement wrote that Tuesday\u2019s election \u201cprovides a test of the tension between perceptions of the president and perceptions of the economy. Rarely has there been as great a distance between views about the economy and a president\u2019s ratings as there is this year.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s true. Of the past 13 presidents, seven enjoyed periods where the economy was doing about as well as it is now. Yet when the economy was booming for those presidents \u2014 George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, Richard Nixon, Lyndon B. Johnson, Dwight D. Eisenhower and Harry Truman \u2014 most enjoyed approval ratings of about 60 percent. Trump, on the other hand, has been hovering in the low 40s. The only president lower was Truman, who was deeply unpopular at the end of the presidency because of the Cold War.\n\n[It\u2019s the economy, stupid? Not for Trump.]\n\n(Truman, by the way, held the same disdain for the press as Trump. When a Post music critic wrote an unfavorable review of Truman\u2019s daughter\u2019s singing contest, Truman wrote to him personally and said: \u201cIt seems to me that you are a frustrated old man who wishes he could have been successful. When you write such poppy-cock as was in the back section of the paper you work for it shows conclusively that you\u2019re off the beam and at least four of your ulcers are at work. Some day I hope to meet you. When that happens you\u2019ll need a new nose, a lot of beefsteak for black eyes, and perhaps a supporter below! Pegler, a gutter snipe, is a gentleman alongside you. I hope you\u2019ll accept that statement as a worse insult than a reflection on your ancestry.\u201d)\n\nThere are divergent opinions about whether Trump is strategic or just unfiltered, but in either case his focus on immigration and fear in the last days of the campaign, which may yet prove to be an effective motivator for his base, has served to remind his critics what they dislike about him.\n\nFor a subset of Republican candidates, Trump\u2019s incendiary rhetoric about the caravan of migrants headed to the southern border, is helpful in shoring up Trump loyalists to the polls. But it has taken all the oxygen away from other Republicans who would prefer, and benefit, if he just kept reminding voters over and over how well the economy is doing.\n\nThe thing is, he\u2019s apparently well aware that\u2019s what he should be doing. At a rally in Florida Saturday night for Senate and gubernatorial candidates, respectively, Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis, Trump said:\n\nSome of the fake news was saying, I was watching, \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t he talk about the economy? Why does he talk about immigration and what\u2019s coming up with the caravan? Why does he talk about the caravan when he\u2019s got maybe the best numbers on the economy in the history of our country?\u201d And we can talk about the economy, but the fact is we know how well we\u2019re doing with the economy and we have to solve problems. I\u2019m looking to solve problems.\n\nEven Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), who is in an reelection race against Democrat Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, toned down the immigration rhetoric and upped the jobs numbers in his final weekend of campaigning, telling voters, \u201cWe\u2019ve got a good thing going,\u201d according to the Dallas Morning News.\n\nNow Republicans have former president Barack Obama out on the trail reminding voters that the economy bounced back from a recession during his presidency and the unemployment rate was dropping at a steady rate before he turned over the keys to the Oval Office.\n\n\u201cSo, when the Republicans start talking now about look how great the economy is \u2014 where do you think that started? It didn\u2019t start there,\u201d Obama said at a rally in Georgia on Friday for gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams. \u201cThey start talking about how, look at all the jobs we created. We created more jobs in my last 21 months than they created in their first 21 months. What are they talking about?\u201d\n\nBut maybe in this election year it doesn\u2019t matter that Trump is diverting attention from the economy.\n\nWhat will ultimately motivate people to the polls on Tuesday could be the deep uneasiness felt on both sides about the future of the country. Despite Americans feeling economically secure, they don\u2019t feel secure. With the recent spate murders of innocent people in a grocery store, a synagogue and a yoga studio in just the past week, there\u2019s a palpable tension in the air. Democrats are terrified of repeating the mistakes of 2016 \u2014 ginning up for a big victory only to be let down. Republicans fear losing control of Congress and the ability to set the legislative agenda.\n\nSo maybe in this election, it\u2019s not the economy, stupid.", "FILE - In this Jan. 19, 2017 file photo provided by U.S. law enforcement, authorities escort Joaquin \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzman, center, from a plane to a waiting caravan of SUVs at Long Island MacArthur Airport, in Ronkonkoma, N.Y. Guzman\u2019s trial is set to begin Monday, Nov. 5, 2018, with jury selection. Opening statements are expected on Nov. 13. (U.S. law enforcement via AP, File) (Associated Press)\n\nNEW YORK \u2014 He is accused of having a hand in dozens of murders, of using his drug cartel to smuggle more than 200 tons of cocaine into the United States, even pulling off running the massive operation from behind bars. That\u2019s when he wasn\u2019t busy escaping from jail \u2014 twice.\n\nThe almost-mythical criminal pedigree of Mexican drug lord Joaquin \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzman, who was extradited in 2017 to face U.S. drug conspiracy charges, has sparked security concerns at his upcoming New York City trial that at times have drawn as much attention as the case\u2019s sensational allegations.\n\nA look at those concerns for a trial that is starting Monday with jury selection. Opening statements are likely Nov. 13.\n\n___\n\nWITNESSES IN THE CROSSHAIRS\n\nProsecutors say Guzman was in the habit of ordering the killings of anyone who got in his way during his heyday in Mexico as boss of the Sinaloa cartel.\n\nIn his way now is a lineup of government witnesses who survived the wave of violence and are expected to give details about the ruthless way he kept power for 20 years in the cutthroat world of international drug trafficking. The defense says the witnesses are the true bad guys whose testimony shouldn\u2019t be trusted.\n\nThe names of the witnesses have been blacked out on court documents with prosecutors saying their identities need to be protected because their cooperation could put them in the crosshairs of a vengeful cartel. According to court papers, some are being held in special jail units for their protection, while others are in witness protection programs.\n\nThe list of people who could turn up on the witness stand is long. Two standout possibilities are twin brothers Pedro and Margarito Flores, former Chicago-based narcotics wholesalers who did business with Guzman before their arrest in 2008. They agreed to cooperate and record phone conversations with Guzman about the size of shipments smuggled on boats and airplanes.\n\nIn one, a voice identified as Guzman\u2019s asks, \u201cHow much can you get rid of in a month?\u201d\n\nThe now imprisoned brothers paid a steep price for flipping: Prosecutors say in 2009 their father was murdered in Mexico by a cartel hit team.\n\n___\n\nFORTIFYING THE COURTHOUSE\n\nAt pretrial hearings leading to the trial, heavily armed federal officers and bomb-sniffing dogs patrolled outside. Anyone trying to attend the hearings was put through airport-style metal detectors at the courthouse entrance and at the door of the courtroom itself.\n\nThe judge also agreed with prosecutors that the jury for the case should be kept anonymous, a measure typical in terrorism or mob cases where jury intimidation is a concern.\n\nNo one\u2019s hiding the ominous nature of the case from potential jurors. Questions for them on an initial screening form ask if they\u2019ve ever heard of \u201cEl Chapo\u201d along with, \u201cHave you, or has anyone close to you, ever felt fearful of or threatened by people who you thought were associated with drug crimes?\u201d\n\nJurors also will be escorted to and from the courthouse by federal officers and sequestered from the public while inside. As a reason, the judge cited prosecutors\u2019 contention that Guzman\u2019s cartel \u201cemploys \u2018sicarios,\u2019 or hit men, who carried out hundreds of acts of violence, including murders, assaults and kidnappings.\u201d\n\n___\n\nKEEPING AN EYE ON EL CHAPO\n\nAfter Guzman was brought to New York, authorities here decided he should be housed in solitary confinement in a high-security wing of a federal jail in Manhattan that has held notorious terrorists and mobsters.\n\nCentral to that calculation was Guzman\u2019s history of giving directions to his lieutenants from Mexican jails and credentials as a two-time escapee there. The second time was via a mile-long (1.6 kilometer-long) tunnel dug to the shower in his cell.\n\nThe logistical problem for his keepers: The case is being prosecuted across the East River in federal court in Brooklyn.\n\nFor pre-trial hearings, authorities opted to transport him to and from jail by shutting down the Brooklyn Bridge to make way for a police motorcade that included a SWAT team and an ambulance, all tracked by helicopters.\n\nThe judge indicated he thinks the time and expense involved would add up to a logistical nightmare \u2014 and an inconvenience for New Yorkers who rely on the bridge to commute \u2014 for a trial expected to last as long as four months. He said there would be adjustments, but didn\u2019t elaborate.\n\nThere\u2019s now speculation that a special cell for Guzman has been set up in the bowels of the courthouse where he will spend the night after his days in court.\n\nBut no one is saying. For security reasons, of course.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(Mason Trinca/For The Washington Post)\n\nA recent University of California at Berkeley study found that the region has \u201clost thousands of low-income black households\u201d as the result of rising housing costs. The study found no similar effect on the income of or departures in white neighborhoods.\n\nThe process compelling minorities to leave for cheaper cities, caused by Bay Area housing shortages and policies that have cemented those market trends, is in effect resegregating a region that has prided itself on ethnic diversity.\n\nA 30 percent median rent increase from 2000 to 2015 translated into a 21 percent decline in minority households, according to the university\u2019s Urban Displacement Project. While it is hard to pin down the average Bay Area rent, estimates place it above $3,000 a month.\n\nBlack neighborhoods in Oakland, Richmond and Berkeley have seen the most precipitous exodus. Most of those leaving are heading east to the less-expensive agricultural valleys, where political resentment toward the coastal elite has been building for years.\n\n[San Francisco \u2014 rich and poor \u2014 turns to simple street solutions that underscore the city\u2019s complexities]\n\nThe crisis is sharpening as Californians prepare to vote Tuesday on a ballot measure that would make it easier for cities and counties to impose certain forms of rent control.\n\nProposition 10, as the measure is known, is unlikely to win judging by recent polling. But when surveys ask California voters if they support rent control in general, a majority say yes.\n\nThis could mark a turn after decades of unsuccessful attempts to give local governments more authority to control housing costs.\n\nIn 2016, five California cities had ballot measures to adopt new rent-control laws. Two were victorious and two more cities, including Santa Cruz in this region, will vote on similar measures Tuesday. Sacramento, the state capital, will have a rent-control initiative on the 2020 ballot.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a shift in public opinion from rent control being popular to rent control being winnable,\u201d said Dean Preston, executive director of Tenants Together, a nonprofit advocacy group. \u201cPeople have just had enough of the runaway rents and it\u2019s fair to see this is as a wave happening across the state in response.\u201d\n\nRethinking rent-control\n\nBlessed and cursed by geography, East Palo Alto is the next frontier of Bay Area gentrification.\n\nThe city has become a hunting ground for real estate speculators eager to turn even the town\u2019s most decrepit properties into homes and apartments for the tech sector. The offers of cash \u2014 and it is often cash \u2014 have proved irresistible to some homeowners here who never imagined their tiny two-bedroom bungalows would one day be worth seven figures.\n\nLandlords are using evictions and rent hikes to prepare residential neighborhoods for redevelopment at a time when the city\u2019s wealthy neighbors, from San Jose to Sunnyvale, are in some cases actively opposing affordable housing projects.\n\nThe spillover has prompted city leaders here to try to collect some money from the companies building offices with no accompanying housing for the workers.\n\nA measure on the East Palo Alto ballot would impose a tax on each square-foot of large commercial office space, which city leaders say would raise a few million dollars a year for affordable housing and job training. The measure is known colloquially as the \u201ctech tax.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe market is fundamentally broken,\u201d said Daniel Saver, senior attorney for the nonprofit Community Legal Services, who after graduating from Harvard Law School six years ago works with low-income tenants and homeowners here. \u201cThis is a regional problem, and we can\u2019t solve a regional problem on our own.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the early 1980s on, California\u2019s powerful real estate lobby managed to kill every new measure to expand rent control proposed at the state and local levels. The crackdown followed a golden age of tenant rights activism in California when cities such as Berkeley, Santa Monica and East Palo Alto adopted strong rent control measures.\n\nProposition 10 has revived the long-dormant debate at the state level. If passed, the measure would effectively nullify legislation known as the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act, which the state legislature passed in 1995.\n\nCosta-Hawkins did not eliminate all local rent control in the state. But it prohibited local jurisdictions from implementing two regulations that affordable housing advocates say would better protect residents of cities such as this one amid the real estate boom.\n\nOne allowed local governments to limit rent increases when one tenant leaves an apartment and another tenant moves in, even if the new rent remains below market value.\n\n[America is more diverse than ever \u2014 but still segregated]\n\nEast Palo Alto had the regulation in place before Costa-Hawkins. Tenant rights advocates say vacancy control, as the regulation is known, removes the financial incentive for landlords to evict tenants and hike the rent.\n\nThe other allowed local governments to apply rent-control regulations to single-family homes and condominiums. Proposition 10 opponents have focused on this element, in particular, because of its implications for the rights of individual homeowners.\n\nBut its advocates say the idea is to discourage real estate speculators, many of whom are now scouring East Palo Alto for investment homes.\n\nSeveral major state newspapers and a variety of interest groups, including some usually aligned with Democrats, have come out against Proposition 10. By opening the door to new rent-control regulations, its opponents argue, the measure will discourage developers from building housing at a time it is desperately needed.\n\n\u201cThis would only make a bad situation worse,\u201d said Steven Maviglio, a spokesman for the No on Prop 10 campaign. \u201cI think voters are smart enough to realize that there is not a wave-the-magic-wand-and-it\u2019s-fixed solution to this.\u201d\n\n'A semi-feudal society'\n\nMore than three decades ago, the campaign to incorporate this city was propelled by the high cost of housing. East Palo Alto was then a low-income corner of wealthy San Mateo County, and there was little desire among the broader elected leadership to intervene in the housing market. The city became one in 1983.\n\nThe first law that the new city council passed was a rent-control measure. Almost immediately, real estate interests sought to repeal the law through a ballot initiative, fearing it could prompt other cities to follow suit. Voters upheld the law.\n\n\u201cThis fight has become part of our DNA,\u201d said Mayor Ruben Abrica, who served on that first city council and has been in local elected office ever since. \u201cThe forces behind us to have a city government in the first place are the same forces now that demand we do something about affordable housing.\u201d\n\nThe median home price here is more than $1 million, a mixed-blessing milestone passed just a few months ago that culminated a 25 percent price increase over just the past year. But the median household income of $55,170 remains nearly a third of that of neighboring Palo Alto and half that of adjacent Menlo Park.\n\n\u201cSocially and economically in this area we\u2019re living in a semi-feudal society,\u201d Abrica said.\n\n\n\nRVs line Bay Road in East Palo Alto, Calif.

(Mason Trinca/For The Washington Post)\n\nThose economic conditions make this city particularly vulnerable to the forces of gentrification. Many longtime residents are income poor and property rich. They are the prime targets for real estate speculators and investment companies with cash.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a gold mine here right now,\u201d said Mahoni, one of those targets, who makes his living trading on eBay.\n\nHe bought his house \u2014 single-story, a patch of lawn surrounded by a chain-link fence out front \u2014 in 2009. That is the era known here as \u201cbefore Facebook,\u201d whose arrival two years later electrified the property market. He paid $330,000.\n\n[As gentrification escalates in Calif., people wonder: Where can the homeless go?]\n\nMahoni grew up in San Mateo County in a house his parents bought for about $112,000 in 1985 and is now worth 10 times that. While he has resisted the money, many of his neighbors have not or have been forced out by rent hikes.\n\nHis cousin is moving to the East Bay from a home on the next street over. He has several friends who in the past year have sold houses and resettled as far away as Tracy, a city about 60 miles east in the San Joaquin Valley.\n\n\u201cNo one wanted any part of us when the crime was high here, and that\u2019s what is also frustrating about all this new interest,\u201d said Mahoni, who intends to leave the home to his seven children. \u201cI tell people only sell if you have to, that you have the character not to sell your soul to the devil. But for some people it\u2019s just too much money not to.\u201d\n\nThe politics of race is also in the city\u2019s genetic makeup.\n\nAn exodus in the early 1970s of white residents from the city, then plagued by one of the highest crime rates in the country, turned the racially mixed student body of its only high school into one that was almost entirely black.\n\nProtests ensued over what demonstrators argued was de facto segregation, and the school, Ravenswood High, closed in 1976. It is now the site of a Home Depot.\n\nEast Palo Alto high school students are bussed into Menlo Park and Atherton, far wealthier neighborhoods where campuses are tucked among walled communities.\n\nSigns stapled to telephone poles here advertise the Street Code Academy, a nonprofit organization that helps local kids learn to write computer code. It offers a small door to the economy outside the city limits, where residents have long had to travel for even the most basic services.\n\nThere was no grocery store in East Palo Alto for two decades, a food-desert period that ended in 2009. But those living on the west side, cut off from the rest of the city by Highway 101, still have no nearby place to shop for groceries, school supplies or much else.\n\nNow the east and west, where the majority of its rent-controlled and government-subsidized apartments are located, will be connected by a long-sought bike and pedestrian overpass.\n\nIt is under construction now, long after richer and whiter nearby cities had similar projects built. Groceries, clothes and fast food will soon be within walking distance to westside residents, marooned for years on the side of the highway that features a Ferrari-Maserati dealership.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re losing people, yes, but there will always be poor people here,\u201d Abrica said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t care for the most vulnerable, and the loss continues, there will be an apartheid system.\u201d", "LUCKNOW, India \u2014 Police in India said Sunday that they are investigating allegations that a 4-year-old girl was gang-raped while being treated in an intensive care unit at a hospital in the country\u2019s north.\n\nLocal police official Mahesh Srivastava said that the girl told her grandmother she was raped by a hospital attendant and four others when she was alone Saturday night.\n\nHe said one man was in custody and police were looking for others.

If you\u2019re the kind of police department that would hire someone who attended a Ku Klux Klan meeting, you knew something like this was going to happen. How could you not know that?\u201d\n\nSylvia Perkins is sitting in an oversized chair at her home in a Little Rock subdivision. She\u2019s wearing a black sweatshirt displaying a photo of her son, Bobby Moore. He\u2019s smiling and saluting while wearing a Boston Celtics cap. The shirt\u2019s format is familiar. It is similar to shirts worn by participants in police brutality protests all over the country. It is a shirt you wear when someone you love was killed by the police.\n\n(Washington Post illustration; Hastings photo by Danny Johnston/Associated Press, Moore photo by Andrea Morales for The Washington Post)\n\nFifteen-year-old Bobby Moore was fatally shot in 2012 by Josh Hastings, a police officer with the Little Rock Police Department. Despite serving on the force for only five years, Hastings\u2019s tenure would prove to be enormously consequential. He had been hired over the objection from a high-ranking black police officer, and that objection was well-founded: Before his hiring, Hastings had once attended a meeting of the Ku Klux Klan, then lied about it on his application. He went on to accumulate an astonishing disciplinary record, usually resulting in lax punishment for misconduct.\n\nHastings once boasted about body-slamming a homeless black woman to the ground. Video footage showed he had lied about a burglary investigation. He slept on the job, drove recklessly and had problems activating his dashboard-mounted camera. He admitted to using racist language. He sometimes needed help writing reports, and colleagues described him as lazy, incompetent and unfit to be a police officer.\n\nSylvia Perkins at her apartment in Little Rock in September. (Andrea Morales for The Washington Post)\n\nHastings\u2019s ultimate confrontation with Moore, then, seemed almost inevitable. He confronted Moore and two other boys after reports that they were breaking into cars. When the boys managed to get one of the cars started, Hastings fired into the car, killing Moore. Hastings would later claim Moore was attempting to run him over, but forensic analysis showed the vehicle was either stopped or moving backward, and Moore\u2019s wounds were consistent with a driver backing up, not surging forward. The other boys were not wounded.\n\nBut Hastings\u2019s story isn\u2019t one of a rogue, aberrant cop so much as a glimpse into the police culture of Arkansas\u2019s largest city. Disturbing as Hastings\u2019s disciplinary record may be, other officers in the department have even thicker personnel files. In fact, many of the very officers who trained and supervised Hastings have had lengthy histories of misconduct \u2014 including domestic violence, lying, and the use of excessive force.\n\nA review of LRPD personnel records, emails and court cases dating back to Hastings\u2019s hiring in March 2007 suggests a department plagued by nepotism, cronyism and racism \u2014 both blatant and subtle. Internal investigations of officer misconduct can be sloppy and incomplete, and are often haphazardly conducted by officers with clear conflicts of interest. There appears to be little supervision at any level, whether by sergeants over beat cops, the high command over supervising officers, or city and elected officials over the department\u2019s leadership. When officers have been fired \u2014 and it takes a lot to get fired \u2014 they are often able to appeal and win back their jobs, either in court or through the city\u2019s Civil Service Commission, usually with the help of the police union.\n\n\u201cThe sheer number of misconduct allegations against some of these officers is staggering,\u201d said Chiraag Bains, former senior counsel for the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division. Bains, who is now a visiting fellow at Harvard\u2019s Criminal Justice Policy Program and is now director of legal strategies for the reform group Demos, co-wrote the Justice Department\u2019s report on policing in Ferguson, Mo. I asked him to look over and comment on my reporting from Little Rock. \u201cAssuming these allegations are true, there\u2019s a lot here that\u2019s deeply disturbing. The lack of discipline and accountability is almost comical. And it appears to be a diverse array of misconduct, not just excessive force or shootings,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Josh Hastings story, then, is also one of cascading institutional failure.\n\n\u201cJosh Hastings was fired and criminally charged,\u201d said Lt. Johnny Gilbert Jr., the only high-ranking officer to raise objections to Hastings\u2019s hiring. \u201cBut getting rid of him doesn\u2019t get rid of the rot, of the internal rot, that allowed Josh Hastings to happen. If you don\u2019t get at that rot, you just get more officers like Josh Hastings.\u201d\n\nHastings has already been found personally liable for Moore\u2019s death but holding the LRPD accountable for its failure to prevent the incident is more of a challenge. Under federal law, cities and towns aren\u2019t liable for the actions of the police officers in the way private corporations are often liable for the actions of their employees. Instead, a plaintiff must show a pattern or culture of deficient training, supervision and misconduct so pervasive that constitutional violations are nearly inevitable \u2014 a type of lawsuit known as a Monell claim. Because elected officials are often loath to criticize police agencies, Monell claims are often the last best hope for reforming an out-of-control police department. But they are also expensive, time-consuming and rarely successful. It can be difficult to even get such a claim in front of jury. Consequently, there also aren\u2019t many lawyers who will take them on.\n\nMoore\u2019s family filed a lawsuit alleging that Hastings was personally liable for the boy\u2019s death and that the LRPD and city were liable under Monell. While they were successful against Hastings, last year, a federal district court judge rejected the Monell claim from Moore\u2019s family, effectively removing the police department and city of Little Rock from its lawsuit. The family appealed. In April, the case moved to oral arguments before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit. At those hearings, civil rights lawyer Michael Laux, representing Moore\u2019s family, and lawyers for Little Rock debated whether the training, policies, supervision and disciplinary record of the Little Rock Police Department are deficient, and whether those deficiencies could foreseeably lead to violations such as the fatal shooting of Moore. The decision should come down later this year.\n\nBut the repercussions of this case could go well beyond Little Rock. The Trump administration has made clear that the Justice Department will no longer investigate and oversee problem police agencies as the Obama administration did in places such as Ferguson, Baltimore and Chicago. Police reformers say that will make it more difficult to draw attention to problematic police agencies, much less push for systemic reform. Difficult as they are to win, lawsuits such as the one brought by Moore\u2019s family may still be the best chance.\n\n\u201cTo me, this looks like a strong Monell claim,\u201d said Bains. \u201cI\u2019d be really concerned if the 8th Circuit doesn\u2019t overturn the district court\u2019s ruling. If it doesn\u2019t, the court is telling other plaintiffs, other victims of this sort of misconduct, that they aren\u2019t going to get any relief either.\u201d\n\nTwo legacies\n\nJohnny Gilbert Jr., a lieutenant with the Little Rock Police Department, in Little Rock. (Andrea Morales for The Washington Post)\n\nBack in 2006, Gilbert found something odd on Hastings\u2019s application to become a Little Rock police officer. In response to a standard question about whether the recruit had ever attended a meeting of \u201ca subversive, violent or racist group,\u201d Hastings checked no. But in different ink, and in different penmanship, there was also an explanation as though Hastings had answered yes. The added script explained that Hastings had once attended a KKK meeting with a friend and the friend\u2019s grandfather, but only to see \u201cwhat was going on in the community.\u201d\n\nRecruits are typically given polygraph tests after filling out their questionnaires. Gilbert, at the time, headed the LRPD division that oversaw the administration of polygraphs. \u201cI was concerned,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I started asking questions.\u201d Gilbert learned that the person who administered the polygraph was the mother of one of Hastings\u2019s longtime friends, and had known Hastings since childhood. Upon further examination, he discovered that Hastings\u2019s polygraph had been halted \u2014 against policy \u2014 at the point in which the administrator would have asked about any affiliation with racist organizations. Gilbert believes Hastings failed the polygraph and, rather than report it, the administrator stopped the test, persuaded Hastings to be more forthcoming, and went back and wrote in the correct answer to the question. She then gave Hastings another attempt to pass the test \u2014 which he did.\n\nGilbert, who is black, wrote a memo to then-LRPD Chief Stuart Thomas strongly urging him not to hire Hastings. (Thomas would later confirm in a deposition that Hastings had failed the polygraph.) First, Gilbert wrote, Hastings\u2019s attendance at a Ku Klux Klan meeting while he was in high school should have disqualified him, in and of itself. Second, Gilbert had seen countless black applicants rejected for far less.\n\nFrom Johnny Gilbert\u2019s 2007 memo objecting to the hiring of Josh Hastings.\n\n\u201cI saw young men \u2014 good young men \u2014 get rejected because they might have briefly been in a gang 10 or 15 years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cOr they had a brother in a gang, and maybe they were briefly a messenger,\u201d Gilbert says. \u201cAny affiliation at all, and you were disqualified. It was zero tolerance. The policy made no room for redemption. Now here\u2019s this kid, he attends a meeting of the Ku Klux Klan, and we\u2019re going to hire him?\u201d Gilbert slowly shakes his head from side to side. \u201cNo. No, I can\u2019t abide that.\u201d Asked in a deposition why Hastings was hired, Thomas said, \u201cThe individuals who interviewed him made recommendations, and I went with their recommendations.\u201d\n\n\n\nAt about 200,000 people (740,000 in the metro area), Little Rock is the largest city in Arkansas. But it can often feel more like a large town. There\u2019s not much anonymity. The same family surnames pop up in politics and positions of power. At the LRPD, legacy hires are common, and dating and marriage are allowed within the department. All of this can create problems when police officers are asked to investigate one another.\n\nThere are demographic problems at LRPD, too. For one, as of late last year, the department was 100 officers short of capacity. In a department of currently about 500, that\u2019s a significant shortage of manpower. \u201cIt means longer shifts, less backup and more stress,\u201d said Gilbert. \u201cWhen officers are tired, worried, on edge, they\u2019re less patient. You\u2019re more likely to resort to force. You\u2019re more likely to panic.\u201d\n\nThe LRPD faces this shortage despite the fact it pays nearly as well as or better than any police agency in the state. \u201cIt\u2019s an image problem,\u201d Gilbert said. \u201cParticularly in the city, no kid dreams of becoming a cop someday. We\u2019re the bad guys. And that\u2019s on us.\u201d\n\nAs with many cities, Little Rock experienced significant white flight over the latter half of the 20th century \u2014 white people made up 74 percent of the city population in 1970, compared with about 47 percent now. But the department itself is still 65 percent white. Perhaps more importantly, most officers \u2014 and a large majority of the white officers \u2014 live outside the city limits. \u201cIt\u2019s a problem, no question about it,\u201d said Charles Blake, a state legislator who represents a working-class, 70-percent black district in southeast Little Rock. \u201cIf police officers don\u2019t have a personal investment in the communities they patrol, there\u2019s no sense of being on the same team. They need to reach out more \u2014 we need better relationships between the LRPD and black neighborhoods in Little Rock.\u201d\n\nReaching out would help, but so would taking racism within the department more seriously. Colleagues say Hastings was once heard calling a group of blacks a \u201cbunch of monkeys.\u201d Other colleagues have said in depositions that Hastings and another officer were also known to refer to a particular black neighborhood in Little Rock as the \u201cn\u2011\u2011\u2011\u2011\u2011.\u201d (In a 2016 deposition, Hastings denied using the term, but said he did hear another officer use it.) Hastings himself testified at a deposition that he often used the n-word, and that his high-ranking LRPD father had used it around the house when he was growing up.\n\nHastings\u2019s partner, Arthur McDaniel, also testified to using the word, though he said he avoids saying it directly to black people \u2014 \u201cout of respect.\u201d In 2014, McDaniel was accused of calling a white woman who was dating a black man a \u201cn\u2011\u2011\u2011\u2011\u2011 whore.\u201d He denied the accusation, but retired (apparently due to post-traumatic stress disorder), and the department ceased its investigation. Another officer was also allowed to retire for medical reasons as he was being investigated for calling a group of black residents \u201ca pack of spades.\u201d Officer Todd Payne was perhaps the worst example. In 2010, he sent an email to fellow officers about an officer\u2019s shooting of an elderly black man with the words \u201cDead N\u2011\u2011\u2011\u2011\u2011\u201d in the subject line. (The deceased happened to be the father of two LRPD officers.) Payne also once left white-supremacist magazines in his squad car, and left misogynist, homophobic and threatening messages on the voice mail of an insurance agent. Payne was finally fired in 2010 \u2014 not for any of those incidents, but for feigning an illness to avoid breaking up a bar fight.\n\nIt seems to be a self-perpetuating problem. Many of the city\u2019s black residents don\u2019t trust the police department, for reasons that range from personal experience, to poor officer outreach, to the aforementioned incidents \u2014 some of which made local headlines. Gilbert and other critics believe hiring more black officers would help to change the culture at LRPD, as would hiring more officers who live in the city. But the department\u2019s image problem makes it difficult to recruit.\n\nGilbert knows this as well as anyone. When he first applied to become a Little Rock police officer during the 1980s, he had just been honorably discharged after serving as a military police officer in the Air Force. Despite those strong qualifications, he was rejected. Then, a few years after his rejection, he received a phone call. If he still wanted the job, the voice on the line told him, it was his. But the call hadn\u2019t come from the LRPD. It had come from the Justice Department. The city had entered into a consent decree with the federal government as the result of a discrimination suit brought by the Little Rock Black Police Officers Association. Gilbert\u2019s father, himself an LRPD officer, had founded that organization and had initiated the lawsuit. Johnny Gilbert Jr. has been with the LRPD ever since.\n\nOne thing that has particularly bothered Gilbert over the years is that, even after Hastings admitted to attending the Klan meeting, no one followed up. No one interviewed Hastings\u2019s friend or the friend\u2019s grandfather to see if Hastings\u2019s story was true. Nor had anyone looked into Hastings\u2019s past to see if there might be other indications of bias or bigotry.\n\nBut no one needed to, because like Johnny Gilbert, Josh Hastings was also a legacy. Two of his cousins were Little Rock cops, as were his uncle and his brother-in-law. Most importantly, Josh\u2019s father, Terry, was one of the highest-ranking officers in the department \u2014 he was the department\u2019s spokesman \u2014 and was a police academy classmate and longtime friend of Stuart Thomas, the Little Rock police chief.\n\nJosh Hastings was hired.\n\nOfficer of the Month\n\nA Little Rock Police Department truck parked near the departments headquarters in Little Rock. (Andrea Morales for The Washington Post)\n\nBefore he had even put on his badge for the first time, Hastings was exposed to a particularly destructive dynamic that would continue throughout his career. First, he was surrounded by badly behaving cops who rarely suffered consequences for their misbehavior. Second, the evidence suggests it was made clear to Hastings that even the lax rules that governed those officers simply didn\u2019t apply to him.\n\nIt began almost immediately, during his time at the police academy. In a deposition, one of Hastings\u2019s classmates at the academy recalled an incident in which the entire class had to retake a test in an effort to save Hastings\u2019s job. (Capt. Heath Helton, who was in charge of training at the time, has disputed this story in a deposition, as has Hastings.) Another classmate also recalled Hastings\u2019s father sometimes stopping by the academy to bring items that his son had forgotten, whether it was police equipment or, in one case, his lunch.\n\nAfter graduating from the academy, new police officers are assigned to a field training officer, or FTO, who is tasked with teaching the rookie the day-to-day aspects of the job. Hastings\u2019s FTO was Officer Ralph Breshears. By the time he retired late last year, according to police records, Breshears had been disciplined numerous times, including for multiple car accidents. He was involved in two shootings. He had at least 12 citizen complaints of excessive force against him that were ruled unfounded or unsustained, as well as five complaints for threats or verbal abuse, two complaints for theft, and one for racial profiling. Breshears was actually fired in 2002 after making an illegal arrest, then lying about the incident in his police report. He sued, won back his job, and was reinstated. He was then disciplined again in 2005 for hog-tying a handcuffed man, and then again in 2006 for failing to activate his dash cam. It was after all this that Breshears was assigned to be Hastings\u2019s FTO.\n\nAfter training Hastings, Breshears went on to have misconduct charges against him sustained again in 2009, and then again in 2010. Breshears would later reappear in Hastings\u2019s career. When Hastings killed Moore in 2012, Breshears was on the team that investigated his former protege. Early on, Breshears claimed with little evidence that the car Moore was driving could not have been in reverse, a conclusion that might have cleared Hastings had forensic analysis not later shown it to be wrong.\n\nAbout 10 months into the job, Hastings was sustained on his first violation: failing to activate his dash cam. (\u201cSustained\u201d means that an internal investigation verified and upheld the complaint or accusation.) In a deposition with Helton, the head of LRPD training, Laux asked about what he perceived to be a pattern in this area \u2014 repeated incidents in which officers had failed to activate their dash cams or body microphones during a use-of-force incident. Many such cases also involved a citizen who had filed a complaint alleging excessive force. Often, Laux found, the officers would be sustained for failing to activate the device, but exonerated for excessive force. They would then receive minor discipline for failing to activate the device. Some exonerations for excessive force came even after the officers\u2019 account was directly contradicted by one or more people.\n\nLaux asked Helton whether it was possible this pattern might incentivize officers to turn off their devices before a potential excessive-force situation. Helton replied, \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nLaux followed up, asking Helton whether officers might less likely to follow the rules if the rules aren\u2019t properly enforced. \u201cNo,\u201d Helton replied. \u201cI think people tend to make choices on their own.\u201d\n\nHastings was cited five times for failing to activate his recording device. He was exonerated once; the other four charges were sustained, with discipline ranging from counseling to a one-day suspension.\n\nFrom Hastings's disciplinary history.\n\nIn all, Hastings was sustained for disciplinary violations more than 30 times \u2014 on charges including loafing or sleeping on the job, abusive language, failure to file reports, failure to appear in court, failure to notify authorities of a dead body, conduct unbecoming an officer, insubordination, and untruthfulness. He was also repeatedly cited for reckless driving. At one point, after multiple warnings for speeding and engaging in too many high-speed chases, he was instructed not to exceed 85 miles per hour. Soon after, he was involved in another high-speed chase that ended with his suspect crashing into a children\u2019s hospital. Hastings was exonerated of any wrongdoing.\n\nOver the course of his short career, LRPD records show that Hastings used force against a Little Rock resident or visitor 41 times. But during discovery for the Moore family\u2019s lawsuit, Laux found a number of incidents in which a use of force wasn\u2019t properly classified or Hastings failed to document it. He puts the total number at 63. Of those 63 incidents, Laux calculated that 49 involved Hastings using force against a black person. In all, 84 percent of the people against whom Hastings used force were either black or Latino. To put it another way, while non-Hispanic whites make up about 47 percent of Little Rock\u2019s population, they make up just 16 percent of the people against whom Hastings used force.\n\nIn one incident in July 2010, Hastings body-slammed a homeless, mentally ill black woman, then sat on her stomach as he waited for her to be taken for treatment. (He claimed the woman slapped him after he woke her up.) He admitted in a deposition years later that \u201cbody slam\u201d was the appropriate term for what he had done. Yet, at the time, Hastings\u2019s supervisor made the young officer seem almost gallant. He wrote that Hastings merely \u201cwrapped his arms around\u201d the woman, and \u201cplaced her on the ground.\u201d Hastings also later admitted that his supervisor\u2019s account of the incident wasn\u2019t accurate.\n\nNotably, up until he shot Moore, Hastings was almost always disciplined only for conduct that affected other police officers, or over internal matters. Nearly every time he was accused of misconduct by someone outside the department, he was cleared of any wrongdoing. At worst, he might be sustained for failure to activate his recording device, but not for the behavior that was the subject of the complaint.\n\n\u201cYou see this a lot,\u201d Laux said. \u201cThey\u2019ll discipline officers for lying to other officers, for missing a shift, for not appearing in court. But if it\u2019s an officer\u2019s word against a citizen of Little Rock, especially a black citizen, you almost have to have video catching them in the act. And even then.\u201d According to department records, Hastings\u2019s longest suspension came in April 2012: 15 days for sleeping in his car. By contrast, he wasn\u2019t even disciplined for body-slamming the homeless woman. (He was sustained and given counseling for using profanity, which was picked up by his body mic.)\n\nHastings\u2019s colleagues and supervisors seemed to enable his conduct. One supervising officer admitted that she had to assist the young officer in writing his reports, due to \u201cillegible handwriting . . . often misspelled words; improper grammar\u201d and \u201cimproper usage.\u201d (Hastings also once suggested his wife had written one of his reports, but later backtracked.) When Hastings was suspended in 2011 for missing court on six occasions over just a few months, he assured his commanding officers that he had taken measures to make sure it wouldn\u2019t happen again. Those measures: He had asked his father to call him to remind him when he was to appear in court. Hastings was 26 years old at the time.\n\nBetween March 2008 and March 2009 alone, Hastings was suspended, warned for failing to submit reports, warned for submitting incorrect reports, given a \u201cletter of counseling\u201d for missing court, given a poor performance review and issued a letter of reprimand. The following April, he was named Officer of the Month.\n\nNext to mentor after Breshears was Sgt. Cristie Young, who oversaw Hastings from the fall of 2007 through 2010, had been suspended multiple times, including for making \u201cterroristic threats,\u201d insubordination and interfering with an investigation. Young was then fired in 2011 after a domestic violence incident with her husband in which she barricaded herself in her home. She was found to have lied to her supervisor, internal affairs investigators and a judge about that incident. She later sued, won and was reinstated with $250,000 in back pay. She was fired again in 2016, this time for allegedly lying about an incident involving other officers during her testimony in a deposition. Currently, she is again suing for reinstatement. Young was Hastings\u2019s supervisor and mentor for most of his career.\n\nSgt. Corey Hall, Hastings\u2019s direct supervisor in 2008 and 2009, also had a lengthy disciplinary history. (Given Hastings\u2019s history, it is worth noting that Hall is black.) In 1997, Hall was fired after he drove to Oklahoma and allegedly pointed his gun at his ex-wife\u2019s boyfriend. He sued the department, won and was reinstated. He has since been sued for harassing a female officer (he was ordered to apologize), was the target of an excessive force lawsuit settled by the city and was suspended for 30 days in 2009 (while supervising Hastings) for a domestic violence incident. The same year, he was disciplined for failing to report a use of force. In 2011, Hall was fired again, this time for getting into two off-duty fights in Little Rock bars over a six-month period. He sued in 2013 and was reinstated, albeit at a lower rank. He is still on the force.\n\nAnother supervisor was Officer Kelly Lepore, who was Hastings\u2019s driving instructor. Just over a year before Hastings started, Lepore pulled her gun on a DWI suspect, then pushed her gun into the car near the driver\u2019s face, despite later admitting she had no reason to suspect he was violent. The driver fled, perhaps understandably. He was later apprehended by another LRPD officer who, hearing Lepore\u2019s report, shot the driver after seeing him reach for something \u201cshiny.\u201d The driver was unarmed. Though Lepore was cleared of any wrongdoing at the time, LRPD officials later admitted in depositions that Lepore\u2019s actions during the initial stop were unprofessional, and contributed to the subsequent shooting.\n\nIn 2012, Lepore ordered subordinates to stand on the legs of an obese man who had already been pepper sprayed and handcuffed. As she would later admit in a deposition, Lepore told her officers, \u201cYou ain\u2019t going to hurt this big boy.\u201d The man stopped breathing and died at the scene. Under questioning from Laux during a 2016 deposition, Lepore conceded that she was unfamiliar with official LRPD policy in several areas, including use of force and traffic stops. This seems especially troublesome given that, in addition to teaching police driving, Lepore also was a field training officer for recruits.\n\nHastings\u2019s final supervisor, Sgt. Jackie Parker, had also been disciplined for untruthfulness and was twice cited for failing to activate his recording device. He was once described in a deposition by Helton \u2014 again the officer who oversaw LRPD training \u2014 as \u201cone of those guys . . . [who] required some supervision himself.\u201d (Parker is currently represented by Laux in a separate racial discrimination suit against the LRPD and alleges that the disciplinary actions taken against him were racially motivated.) But even Parker was concerned enough about Hastings\u2019s behavior to write a memo questioning the young officer\u2019s fitness for law enforcement. He recommended that Hastings undergo a mental evaluation. No one ever acted on the memo.\n\nHastings\u2019s attendance at a Ku Klux Klan meeting was revealed to the public in 2010. An LRPD officer had been caught on video flashing his badge while confronting a black rap group and using the word \u201cjigaboo.\u201d In response to protest from civil rights groups, the city held a community forum on race relations. At the forum, a black officer asked Chief Thomas to address Hastings\u2019s attendance at a Klan meeting. Hastings\u2019s high-ranking father was furious and, by one account, had to be physically restrained. The elder Hastings later sent an open letter to local media in which he lambasted the officers who brought up the Klan meeting, claimed his son\u2019s honor had \u201cbeen proven by investigation and his years of service as a LRPD officer,\u201d and called Thomas \u201cone of the best chiefs this Department has ever had.\u201d The revelation created a stir in Little Rock, but not enough for Hastings to be removed from the force. In the two years that followed, Hastings received four more letters of reprimand and four more suspensions.\n\nA month before Hastings shot and killed Moore, he was called to investigate a report of a burglary. He later wrote a report explaining that he had checked the business\u2019 doors and windows, found no evidence of a burglary, and dismissed the incident as a false alarm. The business owner later called back and complained that no LRPD officer ever showed up. Security footage from the business later showed a prowler breaking the store\u2019s front window with a rock and climbing inside. It also showed Hastings\u2019s patrol car driving by the scene. He never stopped, much less got out of his car to investigate. He was found to have been \u201cuntruthful,\u201d but he was allowed to stay on the force.\n\nThe death of Bobby Moore\n\nThe Shadow Lake apartment complex in Little Rock. (Andrea Morales for The Washington Post)\n\nAt about 6 a.m. on Aug. 12, 2012, Sylvia Perkins received a phone call from her son Bobby\u2019s phone. When she answered, it wasn\u2019t Bobby, but her daughter. \u201cMomma, Bobby\u2019s been shot,\u201d she said. Perkins thought her daughter was playing a bad joke on her. She chided the girl and hung up. The phone rang again. Again, it was her daughter, calling her on Bobby\u2019s phone. \u201cMomma,\u201d she said again, \u201cBobby\u2019s been shot.\u201d\n\nOne of the boys with Bobby the night before had fled, found Moore\u2019s sister, and told her what had happened. Perkins\u2019s daughter was already at the scene, the Shadow Lake apartment complex in western Little Rock. It was a warm Sunday morning. Perkins and her husband arrived about 7 a.m.\n\nThe boy who had been in the car with her son confirmed to Perkins what her daughter had told her on the phone \u2014 that Bobby had been shot. When she asked who was responsible, the boy pointed at the police. \u201cThey did it,\u201d he said. A Little Rock officer overheard the boy, realized who he was, and arrested him on the spot.\n\nOther officers milled about, in and out of the sealed-off scene of the shooting. Perkins spotted Lt. Terry Hastings. She had known Hastings for years, from when he had been the community outreach officer in her neighborhood. \u201cI called out to him, Terry! Terry!\u201d she said. \u201cAnd he stopped. And he looked at me. I said, \u2018Can you please tell me what\u2019s happened to my baby? He just turned and walked away. Didn\u2019t say a thing.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAs word got out about Bobby, Perkins\u2019s friends and family began to assemble near the apartment complex. Her father drove in from two hours away. At one point, a homicide investigator named J.C. White \u2014 a black officer who would soon retire \u2014 pulled Perkins and Bobby\u2019s father aside, and asked them to join him in his patrol car. \u201cHe was real serious,\u201d she said. \u201cHe told me, \u2018Miss Perkins, you need to get yourself a lawyer, because there ain\u2019t nothing good about this.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe Shadow Lake apartment complex has two gated entrances. Both were blocked off by police. But the complex\u2019s buildings and parking areas all sit below the road, making them visible from the outside perimeter. Perkins and her family had gathered just outside the complex. She would later find out her son\u2019s body was in the car the entire time. He had died instantly, and was never taken to the hospital. A funeral home director later told her that her 15-year-old son had been shot in the head.\n\nHours passed, still with no official word from police officials about what happened. Perkins agonized as the crowd grew and the midday heat crept in. She watched parishioners file into a nearby church, then watched them file out after Sunday services had ended. Some had heard what happened, and joined the family to pray.\n\nFinally, about 1 p.m., two homicide detectives pulled up in a patrol car. One tried to pull Perkins aside, but she insisted that whatever he had to say, he could say to her friends and family. Perkins recalls what happened next. \u201cHe said, \u2018Ms. Perkins, we did confirm that it was your son Bobby Moore in the car. And he didn\u2019t make it.\u2019 \u201d\n\nA 2012 photo of Bobby Moore, right, with a friend. (Andrea Morales for The Washington Post)\n\nPerkins collapsed to the grass and passed out. When she came to, she asked, \u201cCan we at least see him?\u201d According to Perkins, the officers just climbed back into their patrol car and left. She wouldn\u2019t see her son\u2019s body for another week.\n\nThe confrontation between Moore and Josh Hastings had taken place early that Sunday morning. Hastings and his partner, Arthur McDaniel, received a report of some teens breaking into a car at the Shadow Lake apartment complex. The two agreed on a plan to confront the suspects, but when they arrived, Hastings ditched the plan after finding a hole in the perimeter fence leading to the parking lot. He ducked behind a dumpster, where he saw the suspects \u2014 Moore and two teenage friends \u2014 attempting to break into a Honda Civic. When the boys managed to start the car, Hastings jumped up from behind the dumpster and drew his gun.\n\nBy Hastings\u2019s account, he ordered the car to stop, then approached from the side, giving it plenty of room to drive around him. He testified that the car then accelerated toward him, eventually reaching 25 to 30 miles per hour. As he moved toward an embankment, the car jumped the curb, climbed the embankment and threatened to pin him against a fence. This, he said, is when he fired twice. (He actually fired three times.) According to Hastings, the car stopped just inches from him. It then rolled back down the embankment and into the parking lot before hitting another car and a light pole.\n\nBut Hastings\u2019s version of events contradicted much of the available evidence. The spent shell casings from Hastings\u2019s service weapon didn\u2019t match up with where he claimed to have been standing when he fired. While the statements from the other boys in the car had minor inconsistencies, both said Hastings had shined his flashlight in their eyes just before jumping directly in front of the car. They said Moore then tried to put the car in reverse and began to back up. One said the car was in reverse when Hastings fired; another said it was stopped. But neither of the boys said Moore was driving toward Hastings, or that the car jumped a curb or climbed an embankment. Police investigators and forensic experts hired by the state and Moore\u2019s family later testified that there was no damage to the car to suggest it had jumped a curb or twice traversed a rocky embankment. There was also no evidence on the curb or embankment that either had recently been run over by a Honda Civic.\n\nThen there were Moore\u2019s wounds. One bullet had entered the front of his hand through his left middle finger, then struck him on the left side of his head. The wounds suggested that Moore had one hand on the steering while looking back over his shoulder \u2014 the position most people take while driving or preparing to drive in reverse. Finally, the car\u2019s gear shift was found in neutral. According to the medical examiner, Moore died almost instantly \u2014 he wouldn\u2019t have been able to shift after he was shot.\n\nThere also appear to have been problems with the way Hastings\u2019s colleagues investigated the shooting. Despite the obvious and important question about how the car ended up in neutral, for example, the gearshift was never dusted for fingerprints or tested for DNA. Two witnesses who saw the immediate aftermath of the shooting were never asked to give formal statements. There were differing accounts about which officer first took possession of Hastings\u2019s gun, raising questions about chain of custody. And the crime scene logs \u2014 which list who had access to the evidence as it was being collected \u2014 lacked exit times for the homicide detectives and supervisors conducting the investigation.\n\nPerhaps most disturbing, internal affairs officers also found a prescription bottle for the opioid hydrocodone in the Honda Civic \u2014 the car that Moore and his friends were allegedly trying to steal. The name on the bottle was Philip Staggs \u2014 the officer who instructed Hastings at the police academy, and who had been fired over misconduct related to drug abuse. There is little reason to think Moore or the other boys in the car knew Staggs, and there was no trace of opioids in Moore\u2019s system. There is also no reason to think the car\u2019s owner knew Staggs or had stolen his medication. That leaves as the most likely explanation that either Hastings or McDaniel were in possession of a former colleague\u2019s hydrocodone and either intentionally or mistakenly left it in the car.\n\nThat, in turn, raises the question whether either officer had taken the opioid on the night of the shooting. Yet the bottle was never checked for fingerprints. The LRPD keeps records of drug tests administered to officers, and there is no record that either Hastings or McDaniel were given a drug test that night. There is also no evidence that the department\u2019s internal affairs division made any effort to investigate how the bottle got into the Civic. In a deposition, former chief Thomas said the possibility that Hastings or McDaniel may have left the bottle at the scene \u201cnever even occurred\u201d to him.\n\nIn the end, neither the questionable investigation, nor his family\u2019s cachet in Little Rock were enough to save Hastings\u2019s job. He had finally done something egregious and consequential enough to cost him his badge. This was no small thing. Since 2000, Little Rock police officers have shot and/or killed at least 90 people. Only two of the officers involved in those shootings were found to have used excessive force \u2014 Hastings, and just this past January, his old FTO, Ralph Breshears.\n\nOn Sept. 12, 2012, a month after the shooting, the head of the LRPD homicide unit recommended criminal charges against Hastings, who was then arrested and charged with manslaughter. The following month,\n\ninternal affairs investigators determined that Hastings was untruthful during questioning after the shooting. Thomas responded by terminating Hastings, but only for the shooting. Contradicting his own internal affairs division, the police chief declined to sustain the charges of lying to investigators.\n\n\u201cThis was about damage control,\u201d said Laux, the lawyer representing Moore\u2019s family. \u201cThey knew this was bad, and they were trying to keep Hastings out of prison. If a case boils down to whether a police officer showed poor judgment in shooting someone, most juries will ultimately side with the cop. But if they see evidence that the cop is lying \u2014 that\u2019s the one thing that will get them to turn very quickly.\u201d\n\n\u201cNone of them was ever on our side\u201d\n\nFormer Little Rock police officer Josh Hastings, right, speaks with his wife, Kim, during a break in testimony in his manslaughter trial in Little Rock in 2013. (Danny Johnston/AP)\n\nHastings\u2019s first trial on the manslaughter charge began in June 2013. According to criminologist Philip Stinson, who keeps a database of police arrests and convictions, over the past 13 years, 96 police officers have been charged with murder or manslaughter for a fatal, on-duty shooting, or about 7 per year. Nearly half of those \u2014 46 \u2014 have been since 2015.\n\nOf those 96, 34 were convicted, or just less than three per year. Seven were convicted of murder, but four of those convictions were later overturned. The rest were convicted on lesser charges. So while police officers shoot and kill about 1,000 people each year, about 0.7 percent of those shootings result in criminal charges and about 0.3 percent result in convictions. Just 0.1 percent resulted in murder convictions, and just one of 3 murder convictions in 13 years was upheld on appeal. Stinson said he has yet to find a case in which a police officer has been convicted during a bench trial (when the officer asks for the judge to determine guilt or innocence instead of a jury) for an on-duty fatal shooting.\n\nThere are a few reasons for the dearth of convictions. First, the law affords police officers a great deal of discretion when it comes to the use of deadly force. Second, juries tend to trust law enforcement. If a police officer says he feared for his life, most juries will take him at his word. Third, there\u2019s the blue code of silence \u2014 the tendency of police officers to cover for one another.\n\nThere is one other possible, somewhat more controversial reason police officers are so rarely convicted of using excessive force: Prosecutors may not work as hard to win convictions in these cases. The trial of a police officer puts prosecutors in a precarious position. They rely on the police to investigate crimes, arrest suspects and provide evidence. If a prosecutor loses the respect and cooperation of the police department, it can make his or her job a lot more difficult. As former federal prosecutor and Columbia Law School professor Daniel Richman told NPR in 2014, \u201cI do think that working with police officers, relying on them regularly for them to be your connection to the outside world and your source of cases and evidence, is going to affect how you judge interactions.\u201d\n\nPerkins and Bobby Moore\u2019s other relatives allege the state went easy on Hastings \u2014 that his trials were mostly for show. For example, there was that burglary that Hastings investigated about a month before the shooting. Hastings\u2019s own police department determined he had lied in his report. Hastings\u2019s manslaughter trial more or less hinged on his credibility, on whether jurors believed his account of the shooting. Yet John Johnson, the chief deputy prosecutor, didn\u2019t introduce the burglary investigation or any of Hastings\u2019s lengthy disciplinary history at trial. To Moore\u2019s family, it looked as though the state was handicapping its own case.\n\nDuring a phone interview, Johnson said he didn\u2019t introduce Hastings\u2019s disciplinary record because it wouldn\u2019t have been admissible under the state\u2019s rules of evidence. But other lawyers disagree. \u201cIf Hastings was found by his own police department to have lied, I\u2019d certainly have tried to get that in,\u201d said John Wesley Hall, a longtime defense lawyer in Little Rock, who also served as a prosecutor during the 1970s. \u201cAnd I think there\u2019s a good chance that the judge would allow it.\u201d\n\nOne person whose opinion would seem to be especially important agrees with Hall and disagrees with Johnson: The judge who presided over Hastings\u2019s trial. \u201cI really don\u2019t understand why they didn\u2019t try,\u201d the judge, Wendell Griffen said. \u201cEspecially given that in the first trial, Hastings took the stand for his own defense. They could have confronted him with that. But they never tried.\u201d (It must be noted that Griffen himself is an outspoken and controversial figure. The state supreme court recently prevented him from presiding over death penalty cases after he participated in a protest against capital punishment last year. Laux is representing Griffen in his lawsuit against the state Supreme Court.)\n\nAs for Johnson\u2019s claim that Hastings\u2019s disciplinary record wouldn\u2019t have been admissible, Griffen said, \u201cYou certainly can attack a witness\u2019s credibility based on a previous record or pattern of dishonesty. Mr. Johnson is an excellent attorney, but I don\u2019t know why he\u2019d think you can\u2019t. I have a whole lot of case files in my office that say otherwise.\u201d\n\nJohnson also never called two eyewitnesses to the immediate aftermath of the shooting. That seems significant, since their statements clearly contradicted Hastings\u2019s story. According to the witnesses themselves, no one from the prosecutor\u2019s office ever interviewed them.\n\nIn the end, the jury deadlocked and Griffen declared a mistrial. One juror would later tell a local television station that the two holdout jurors voted for acquittal because they \u201ccouldn\u2019t get past the badge.\u201d One allegedly said during deliberations that, in shooting Moore (who had a lengthy juvenile record), Hastings had prevented the youth from committing any more crimes. (In response to the Moore family\u2019s criticism, Johnson also points out that, while the jury in the first trial deadlocked, the vote was 10 to 2 in favor of conviction.)\n\nAfter the mistrial, Griffen brought lawyers from both sides in to address an issue that had been bothering him. During jury selection, Hastings\u2019s attorney repeatedly used his preemptive strikes against prospective jurors who were black. The first jury was entirely white. More troubling to Griffen, the state didn\u2019t bother to object. \u201cI recall being quite surprised \u2014 in an unpleasant way \u2014 at what was happening,\u201d Griffen said. \u201cThe defense struck black person after black person, and the state let it go on. I didn\u2019t feel I could speak up at the time and still retain my impartiality.\u201d According to Griffen, Johnson told the judge he didn\u2019t object because he didn\u2019t believe Hastings\u2019s attorney (who often represents police officers accused of misconduct) would strike jurors solely on the basis of race. In a court filing, Johnson referred to the challenges as \u201crace neutral.\u201d\n\nI recall being quite surprised \u2014 in an unpleasant way \u2014 at what was happening. The defense struck black person after black person, and the state let it go on. Judge Wendell Griffen\n\nHastings\u2019s second trial followed in September. During the first trial, the state had called an accident reconstruction expert who said the forensic evidence contradicted Hastings\u2019s version of the shooting. In the second trial, the state never called that expert to testify. \u201cI was completely baffled by that,\u201d Griffen said. \u201cThe man was in the courthouse, and they didn\u2019t call him. He completely discredited the defense in the first trial. When they didn\u2019t call him, there was no case. I remember thinking the defense wouldn\u2019t need to call a single witness. Sure enough. They didn\u2019t. There was nothing to challenge.\u201d Johnson would later tell reporters that because Hastings didn\u2019t take the stand, the state didn\u2019t need the expert to rebut him.\n\nAs during the first trial, the state never mentioned Hastings\u2019s history of problems at the police department, and again failed to call the two eyewitnesses. The second trial boiled down to the word of Hastings, a former police officer, against the word of the two teenage boys in the car with Moore. The jury deadlocked again, but this time, the vote was 11 to 1 in favor of acquittal.\n\n\u201cI knew we were in trouble after the first hung jury,\u201d said Perkins. \u201cI knew they\u2019d never convict him. But I felt like they just gave up the second time.\u201d\n\nIn April of 2014, just a few weeks before a third trial was scheduled to begin, Johnson announced that the state would request that all charges against Hastings be dropped. He added that, while he believed Hastings was guilty, he had also concluded that persuading a jury to convict the officer would be impossible.\n\nMoore\u2019s family opposed the decision. Griffen told the family that nothing precluded prosecutors from refiling charges at a later date. But Perkins said she knew then it would never happen. \u201cWhen they announced that the charges were dropped, [Pulaski County Prosecutor] Larry Jegley came in and he shook all of their hands,\u201d Perkins said. \u201cHe shook the hands of every police officer in the room. No one shook my hand. No one came up to us and said, \u2018Sylvia, we\u2019re sorry about this.\u2019 I had never seen Mr. Jegley before, except on TV. He never tried to reach out to us. We were the victims. He was supposed to be on our side. There he was shaking hands with the other side.\u201d\n\nPerkins added, after a pause, \u201cThat\u2019s when I realized. They were all together. None of them was ever on our side.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel for that family,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI know they were hurting, and I\u2019m sure they still are. But I completely disagree with the idea that we didn\u2019t want a conviction.\u201d\n\nDysfunction on Markham Street\n\nThe Little Rock Police Department headquarters. (Andrea Morales for The Washington Post)\n\nJosh Hastings\u2019s career stands out because of the circumstances of his hiring, and because his career ended after he shot and killed someone. But there is considerable evidence that the problems at LRPD that allowed him to be hired and keep his job are systemic \u2014 that the end of his troubled career didn\u2019t end the problems at LRPD, it merely exposed them.\n\nThe department\u2019s early-warning system is a good example. Like many police agencies, the LRPD uses automated computer software to flag potential problem officers. The idea behind such systems is that certain patterns of behavior \u2014 for example, multiple citizen complaints \u2014 are good predictors of other behavior, such as use of excessive force or questionable shootings. \u201cA good early-warning system isn\u2019t just used to punish,\u201d said Seth Stoughton, a former police officer who now teaches law at the University of South Carolina. \u201cIt should also be used to identify officers who are struggling and to provide help.\u201d Early-warning systems can also be used to detect issues such as mental illness, or to find officers coping with unusually high stress. An alert is supposed to notify a supervisor, trigger an investigation and, if appropriate, ultimately result in an intervention \u2014 such as counseling, mentoring, or if merited, disciplinary action.\n\nThe Little Rock Police Department uses software called the Early Intervention System (EIS). Over five years, Hastings triggered 19 EIS alerts. Only one resulted in an intervention: After 21 use of force incidents, 15 vehicle pursuits and 6 misconduct investigations, Hastings was, in April 2010, briefly required to attend biweekly counseling. Over the next eight months \u2014 six of which were while he was under \u201ccounseling\u201d \u2014 Hastings had another nine sustained violations. And yet throughout that period, his supervisors continued to write memos that excused his failures by noting his promises to do better in the future.\n\nFrom Sgt. Cristie Young's 2010 recommending that Hastings not be enrolled in the early intervention system.\n\nOdder still, in court documents for the Moore case, the LRPD claimed that the EIS had issued only three alerts for Hastings. Either the department misled the court, or it paid so little attention to the system that leadership somehow wasn\u2019t aware of the other 16 alerts.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t just Hastings. Officer Kelly Lepore was flagged nine times by the system in the three years before the death of the obese man she had ordered her subordinates to stand on. No action was taken.\n\nAnother example is Officer Christopher Johannes, a member of Hastings\u2019s squad who was flagged 7 times in six years after 69 use of force incidents. Johannes\u2019s dash cam, too, had an uncanny knack of malfunctioning at critical times during incidents that later resulted in citizen complaints. In one incident, a suspect accused Johannes\u2019s partner of punching him while he was handcuffed. Johannes denied seeing or hearing the punch. The dash-cam video improbably malfunctioned for only the six minutes surrounding the alleged punch. But the audio function did continue recording, and captured both the sound of a punch and Johannes scolding his partner for the strike he\u2019d later claim he never saw. Neither officer was disciplined. The sergeant who investigated the incident ultimately said she trusted the honesty of Johannes\u2019s partner more than she trusted the audio recording. Two months later, Johannes was named Officer of the Month.\n\nBetween July 2010 and the end of 2015, the EIS issued alerts on potential problem officers more than 700 times. Just two of those resulted in intervention, according to department records. Both were for abuse of the sick-leave policy.\n\nFor early warning systems to be effective, supervisory staff need to be well-trained on the system and receive ongoing training as the software is tweaked to suit the needs of the department. In a deposition, Thomas, the former chief, testified that the department often failed to send someone to the annual training conference to learn about updates to the system. The sergeant that Thomas assigned to implement the system later testified that he hadn\u2019t even read the Justice Department manual on how to operate it. Even some instances of deadly force somehow never made it into the system.\n\n\u201cTo have just two interventions after over 700 alerts, and for low-level misconduct, is just drastically out of proportion,\u201d said Bains, the former senior counsel for the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division. \u201cIt signifies a deep problem in the department. It\u2019s a sign of a broken system.\u201d\n\nThe LRPD\u2019s issues with training also weren\u2019t limited to Hastings. In 2014, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported that just more than half the department\u2019s officers had not been trained and certified to use a Taser. In fact, among the untrained was the captain in charge of LRPD\u2019s training. The paper found that 44 officers hadn\u2019t been trained to use a baton, and 29 hadn\u2019t been trained to use pepper spray.\n\nAccording to Stoughton, the law instructor at the University of South Carolina, it isn\u2019t unusual for a police agency to take some time to get its officers trained on a newish weapon such as a Taser. \u201cI think you\u2019ll find a lot of police departments can take years to get all of their officers trained on something like a Taser. That doesn\u2019t excuse it. And I\u2019m really alarmed by the high number who aren\u2019t trained to use a baton.\u201d\n\nTo have just two interventions after over 700 alerts, and for low-level misconduct, is just drastically out of proportion. Chiraag Bains, former senior counsel for the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division\n\nIf an officer isn\u2019t trained to use a particular weapon, they shouldn\u2019t be carrying it. It is unclear how many of the LRPD\u2019s officers have carried a Taser without proper training, but at least one fatal shooting suggests it has happened. In one instance in 2006, several officers responded to reports that a man was acting erratically while holding a meat cleaver. Jaime Alvarez, who was having a mental-health crisis, was approached by 10 officers who, with guns drawn, slowly backed him up against the outside of a church. Alvarez was indeed holding a cleaver, but he had pressed it against his own neck, and hadn\u2019t threatened anyone with it. Nevertheless, once they had Alvarez cornered, an LRPD lieutenant attempted to shoot him with a Taser, but missed. Alvarez, who, again, to that point hadn\u2019t threatened any of the officers, responded by throwing the cleaver at the officer. The 10 officers then collectively fired 43 bullets at Alvarez, killing him. Police bullets were later found in the church pews and altar. After the incident, the LRPD admitted that the lieutenant who shot the Taser had never been trained to use the weapon.\n\nTraining problems have also surfaced after other high-profile incidents. After Officer Donna Lesher shot and killed an unarmed, 67-year-old black man in December 2010, she was asked why she hadn\u2019t tried to subdue the man with her baton instead of reaching for her gun. Lesher responded that she didn\u2019t carry a baton because she wasn\u2019t proficient with it, and didn\u2019t feel confident using it. When Capt. Heath Helton, the officer in charge of LRPD training, was asked about Lesher\u2019s statement in a deposition, he questioned Lesher\u2019s own doubts about her ability to use a baton.\n\nA cellphone video, taken in October 2011, showed Lt. David Hudson repeatedly punching the face of Chris Erwin, a patron at a Little Rock restaurant. At the time, Hudson was off duty and working security at the restaurant. He claimed Erwin had refused his order to leave an area of the restaurant, and that Erwin then grabbed his arm. Erwin later said he didn\u2019t remember grabbing Hudson\u2019s arm, but if he had, it was because he was in a daze after Hudson had slammed his head into a wall. In fact, Hudson, a high-ranking and long-serving Arkansas police officer, had a history of punching people in the face. In 1983, he was suspended for striking a suspect with an open hand. In 1993, he was found to have violated department policy, again after punching a man in the face. Hudson was reprimanded for not reporting an incident in which several other officers beat and punched a man in the face at a 2006 college football game. Later the same year, Hudson punched another man in the face, allegedly for being \u201csarcastic.\u201d He was accused of punching another man in 2007, but that complaint was dismissed because the alleged victim\u2019s account differed from the police account. Dash-cam footage could have resolved the discrepancy, but it had been recorded over. Finally, eight months before the 2011 incident caught on video, Hudson had punched another man in the face at the same restaurant,\n\nthen arrested that man for battery.\n\nAfter video of the altercation with Erwin was posted online and made local news, Hudson was initially suspended for 30 days. He appealed the suspension to the Little Rock Civil Service Commission, where he made a surprising argument: He claimed he had no choice but to punch Erwin because he had never been trained to use any other type of force. (Erwin had not punched or threatened Hudson.) Terry Hastings, a longtime friend, vouched for Hudson. He, too, told the Civil Service Commission that Hudson only punched Erwin because, despite his 25 years at the department, and despite his history of punching people, no one had taught Hudson how to resolve an altercation another way. Helton agreed in a deposition a few years later. \u201cI mean, that\u2019s the only thing he was kind of trained to use from. You know, if that was the only thing that he had at his disposal . . . then that\u2019s what he used.\u201d\n\nThe Civil Service Commission revoked Hudson\u2019s suspension, finding that he was \u201cbeing punished by the same people responsible for not preparing him.\u201d As Bains put it, \u201cTo suggest that this longtime law enforcement officer knew of no way to resolve a dispute other than pummeling a man in the face, it just speaks to how broken the system of accountability really is there. It\u2019s just a farce.\u201d\n\nThen there are the questions about the thoroughness and objectivity of the LRPD\u2019s internal investigations. When someone dies at the hands of a police officer, the incident is first investigated by the department\u2019s homicide division. Once that investigation is complete, the internal affairs division (IAD) conducts its own investigation. Afterward, another panel known as the Deadly Force Review Board (DFRB) then assesses not only the incident itself but also the thoroughness and fairness of the homicide and IAD investigations. At first blush, it seems like a fairly robust system, with multiple layers of oversight. But the department has regularly come under fire for sloppiness, bias and clear conflicts of interest in how it investigates officer-involved shootings.\n\nCharles Blake, a state representative for Arkansas 36th District, at the state Capitol in Little Rock. (Andrea Morales for The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cThe victims of the shootings and their families aren\u2019t getting justice,\u201d said Blake, the state representative. Blake recently introduced a bill in the Arkansas legislature that would require all police-involved shootings in the state be investigated by an outside agency. It is similar to a bill recently passed in Wisconsin. \u201cLook, if a shooting was by the book, I have no problem validating the officers\u2019 actions. We should be clearing their names. But if these shootings are all justified, then I don\u2019t see the problem in asking a different police agency to investigate. If the officers are in the right, they\u2019ll still be vindicated. But they\u2019ll be vindicated in a way that earns more trust from the community.\u201d\n\nBlake points to the aforementioned shooting involving Officer Donna Lesher. That shooting was investigated by officers in the homicide division. But the head of the homicide division at the time was Sgt. James Lesher \u2014 Donna Lesher\u2019s husband. The investigation would repeatedly come under criticism for allegations of favoritism. Some of that criticism came from other officers. \u201cEven if you were to conduct the most objective investigation possible, you still have this problem in which the investigators are looking into a shooting by their boss\u2019s wife,\u201d said Stoughton. \u201cYou don\u2019t earn community trust that way.\u201d\n\nAs previously mentioned, the team that initially looked into Josh Hastings\u2019s shooting of Moore included Ralph Breshears, Hastings\u2019s former FTO. And when Hastings\u2019s partner, McDaniel, shot and killed a man in 2010, one of officers who investigated was also McDaniel\u2019s union representative at the administrative hearing about the very same shooting.\n\nIn some cases, LRPD internal investigations have cleared officers without even looking at the relevant department policies. For example, the department has a specific policy detailing how officers are to interact with the mentally ill. But Laux found multiple deadly-force incidents involving mentally-ill suspects in which officers violated the policy, including the Jaime Alvarez shooting. Worse, the homicide and IAD investigations that followed never addressed the officers\u2019 violations of the policy. The subsequent DFRB review of both the shooting and the ensuing investigations also failed to even mention the policy.\n\nOne of the more striking examples came in 2014, Laux deposed Capt. Heath Helton about the Alvarez case. At the time, Helton was both head of training at LRPD and served on the DFRB. Laux asked Helton why the review board\u2019s reports in that case and others did not mention the protocol that officers are required to follow when they encounter someone suffering from mental illness. Helton replied, \u201cObviously, it\u2019s easy to Monday morning quarterback a deal, but, you know . . . I can\u2019t testify to what or speak to what they were seeing at that time, so I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nBut the DFRB is not only charged with assessing the officers\u2019 actions, it is also supposed to review the adequacy of the ensuing investigations. One of its main functions is to consider policy or protocol changes that could prevent unnecessary deaths. \u201cMonday morning quarterbacking is exactly what the DFRB is supposed to do,\u201d Laux said. \u201cI mean, that\u2019s why it exists. It\u2019s one thing to say we shouldn\u2019t second-guess a cop who is caught in a volatile situation. I don\u2019t agree with that, but I get it. But these investigations are supposed to gauge the officers\u2019 actions in light of LRPD policy, and LRPD has a specific policy for interacting with the mentally ill. If the homicide, IAD and DFRB investigations don\u2019t evaluate the officer\u2019s actions against that policy, if they don\u2019t even mention that policy, what\u2019s the point in having the policy in the first place?\u201d\n\nThere are other deadly-force cases during which high-ranking department officials have later admitted that, not only did LRPD officers violate various policies that initial investigators failed to pick up but also that the DFRB then failed to take note of either the violations or the investigators\u2019 lapses. In other words, not only did the investigators fail, the backup investigators did, too. \u201cThe implications here go well beyond a few bad cops getting away with bad decisions,\u201d Laux said. \u201cWhen both the initial investigation and the backup investigation fail to pick up on the critical mistakes, training deficiencies and flawed policies that lead to preventable deaths, those problems don\u2019t get addressed. So more people die.\u201d\n\nAnd then there is the problem of who serves on the DFRB. As the committee that ultimately reviews the work of other investigators, it would be reasonable to think the board is staffed with the most trustworthy officers in the department. But Lt. David Hudson served on one between 2006 and 2010, despite his documented history of face punching (Hudson, now retired, also had a lengthy history of other disciplinary problems, including multiple suspensions for damaging city property, other allegations of excessive force, and several citizen complaints that he had stolen money or property from them during searches.) Capt. Tom Bartsch, who also served on the DFRB, had once been suspended for 30 days when he and other off-duty officers working security at a music festival started drinking, got in a fight with a group of black teenagers and failed to report the incident until the teens\u2019 parents complained.\n\nAdditionally, DFRB members have sometimes lacked sufficient expertise to conduct a proper investigation. One chairman of a DFRB that investigated a shooting of a mentally-ill man admitted during a deposition that he wasn\u2019t familiar with LRPD policy in that area. A member of another DFRB conceded that he lacked the familiarity with autopsy reports required to determine if the bullet wounds in a body were consistent with the police officers\u2019 account of the shooting.\n\n\u201cOn its face, the multitiered system of investigating police shootings in Little Rock seems like a reasonable setup,\u201d said Bains, the director of legal strategy for the advocacy group Demos. \u201cBut such systems are meaningless if they aren\u2019t staffed with people who take them seriously. It\u2019s just words on paper. In fact, it might be worse than meaningless, because it gives the false appearance of accountability while exonerating officers for unnecessary killings.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit\n\nThe Pulaski County Courthouse in Little Rock. (Andrea Morales for The Washington Post)\n\nIn June 2015, Michael Laux filed a lawsuit on behalf of Bobby Moore\u2019s mother, Sylvia Perkins. The lawsuit named not only Hastings, but also former LRPD chief Stuart Thomas for deficient oversight and training. To win a Monell claim against the city, Laux would need to show not only that Hastings violated Moore\u2019s constitutional rights but also that the police department had a pattern or custom of tolerating abuse and excessive force, or so insufficiently trained its officers that Hastings\u2019s shooting of Moore was foreseeable.\n\nThe city fought, and ultimately failed, to keep the disciplinary records of Little Rock officers under seal \u2014 perhaps understandably so, given what was in those files. \u201cWe had a lot of material to work with,\u201d Laux said. He found that many of the worst practices on display at the Hastings shooting \u2014 the incomplete crime scene logs, the lax investigation of police shootings, the soft-glove discipline of habitual-offender officers \u2014 were common throughout the LRPD. In fact, Laux was so disturbed by what he found that in October 2014, he wrote a letter to the U.S. Justice Department to ask for an investigation.\n\nLaux searched through personnel files and compiled a list of officers who had been sustained on charges of \u201cuntruthfulness,\u201d a term that could include providing false information on the witness stand, in depositions, in police reports, or to investigators. Laux found 79 names.\n\nLegally, this is exculpatory information. Under Brady v. Maryland, police departments are supposed compile a list of such officers and provide it to prosecutors, who are then obligated to share it with defense attorneys. In a deposition,\n\nThomas conceded that the department didn\u2019t even keep such a list.\n\n\u201cThat seems odd to me,\u201d said John Wesley Hall, the longtime Little Rock defense attorney. \u201cI know that the sheriff\u2019s department keeps one, so I don\u2019t know why the police department wouldn\u2019t keep one, too.\u201d\n\nAs with the Josh Hastings case, Laux found multiple examples in which LRPD investigations of police-involved shootings were tainted by incomplete crime-scene logs and sloppy evidence handling. Investigators also often asked the officers they were investigating leading questions designed to elicit responses that would help exonerate them. Contrary to practices recommended by groups such as Police Executive Research Forum and the International Association of Chiefs of Police, officers involved in shootings weren\u2019t immediately separated. They were allowed to confer, sometimes for hours after a shooting.\n\nPerhaps more relevant still to the Hastings shooting, Laux also found numerous other incidents in which Little Rock police officers had fired their guns at moving vehicles. There are only a few rarely-occurring scenarios when it would make sense for police to shoot into a moving vehicle. The 2016 terrorist attack in Nice, France, in which the driver of a truck was clearly using the truck as a weapon, is one such example. Most of the time, however, firing at a moving vehicle endangers both bystanders and potentially innocent passengers in the car \u2014 either with stray bullets or a car careening because of an incapacitated driver. It also may put the police officer at risk, because he is concentrating more on neutralizing the driver rather than getting out of the way. Even if it is driving directly toward a police officer, killing the driver is unlikely to stop a car. For these reasons, the Police Executive Research Forum has recommended prohibiting the practice. When the New York Police Department banned the practice 45 years ago, police-involved shootings dropped by a third the following year. Police departments in Boston, Chicago, Philadelphia, Washington and Denver have also barred officers from shooting at moving cars.\n\nThe LRPD does ban officers from shooting into cars, but allows an exception if the officer\u2019s life is in danger. This, again, fails to account for the fact that killing a driver is unlikely to remove the threat. \u201cIn most of these shootings, the car is moving rapidly and in close quarters to the officer,\u201d Bains said. \u201cSo incapacitating the driver isn\u2019t going to take the officer out of danger.\u201d\n\nDespite the ban, Laux found several incidents in which Little Rock police officers fired at vehicles that appear to have posed no direct threat to the officers themselves. In 2005, for example, four officers shot 43 times into a moving car. One officer testified that he was able to get out of the way when his gun jammed, which suggests that shooting at the vehicle wasn\u2019t the only remaining option. The following year, two other officers shot at a truck they claimed was driving at them, despite the fact that all the bullet holes were on the right side of the vehicle. They claimed they were trying to incapacitate the driver \u2014 which, again, wouldn\u2019t likely have stopped the vehicle.\n\nIn 2007, two other officers claimed they had no choice but to open fire when a truck surged toward them in reverse. Again, all the bullet holes were in the side of the truck. That same year, two officers fired 19 rounds at a truck at a crowded gas station. One officer later said she fired after she tripped and fell into the vehicle\u2019s path. Most of the shots struck the side of the vehicle, but at least one struck the adjacent convenience store.\n\nIn June 2010, Officer Arthur McDaniel (Hastings\u2019s partner on the night of the Moore shooting) approached a car whose occupants he suspected of burglary. The car fled, and McDaniel pursued in a high-speed chase through a residential neighborhood. When the car reached a dead end, McDaniel exited his own vehicle and engaged. The suspects\u2019 car shifted into reverse and attempted to flee. The car didn\u2019t strike McDaniel, but drove around him. McDaniel fired most of his shots as the car moved away. He continued to fire after the car drove into a grove of trees and got stuck. When a passenger exited the car and tried to flee, McDaniel began firing at the man from 50 yards away. The passenger was unarmed. He was later apprehended, but was never charged with a crime. McDaniel killed the car\u2019s driver and shot a second passenger in the face.\n\nMcDaniel was later cleared of any wrongdoing, though he was asked to attend a remedial use-of-force class. On the same day he was asked to attend that class, he was named Officer of the Month.\n\nIt is perhaps understandable why LRPD officials might have sympathized with these officers. These were adrenalin-fueled incidents, some after high-speed chases. If someone suspected of criminal wrongdoing drives a car even vaguely in an officer\u2019s direction, it isn\u2019t difficult to see how that officer could mistake an attempt to flee for an attempted homicide by automobile. But if those officers don\u2019t face consequences, a dangerous \u2014 and ineffective \u2014 practice is never corrected.\n\n\u201cWhen you have a policy barring a tactic, but it\u2019s accompanied by a complete failure to enforce that policy, you end up sending the opposite message,\u201d said Bains. \u201cThe real policy here is that there are no constraints on officers shooting into cars.\u201d\n\nOut of time\n\nSylvia Perkins goes through news clippings, photographs and documents from her son Bobby Moore's life at her apartment in Little Rock. (Andrea Morales for The Washington Post)\n\nIn January 2017, U.S. District Court Judge Brian S. Miller dismissed Perkins\u2019s Monell claim against the city of Little Rock. Despite the police department\u2019s considerable history of lax discipline, poor training and bad hiring practices, Miller ruled that Perkins had failed to demonstrate a pattern or practice of policies and customs that made Hastings\u2019s shooting of Moore foreseeable.\n\nMiller dismissed Laux\u2019s argument that the LRPD failed to properly train Hastings by pointing out that, over the course of his career, Hastings received more than 1,300 hours of training. He also ruled that the incidents involving poor training were irrelevant, because few of them involved the use of lethal force, and even fewer were related specifically to the practice of shooting into moving vehicles.\n\nBut Laux also did cite the above incidents, as well as others, in which Little Rock police officers had fired into moving cars. Miller dismissed those cases as \u201cspeculative.\u201d He noted that, in each case, the officers were ultimately exonerated.\n\nMiller similarly dismissed arguments related to the LRPD\u2019s history of lax punishment, writing that \u201cthe failure to investigate an officer who misses a court date or an officer who punches someone under questionable circumstances, for instance, does not logically cause an officer to believe he could shoot and kill someone in violation of the Constitution without fear of punishment.\u201d\n\nBut again, Laux did cite numerous incidents in which officers had not been punished for questionable shootings. Here again, Miller simply noted that they had been investigated and exonerated.\n\nBains contends that Miller\u2019s ruling misapplied the law. \u201cThe court ignored the phenomenon in which failure to discipline in serious but unrelated conduct can make officers perceive that there\u2019s no check on any misbehavior,\u201d he said. \u201cIn a motion to dismiss, the court is also supposed to consider all disputed facts in favor of the plaintiff. Here, the judge made credibility assessments in favor of the police, such as when he characterized the plaintiff\u2019s version of some events as \u2018speculative.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe ruling also demonstrates just how difficult it can be to hold problematic police departments accountable. Laux\u2019s claim against the LRPD included long expositions on the deficiencies in the agency\u2019s investigations of its own officers \u2014 including allegations of bias, evidence tampering and conflicts of interest. Miller dismissed these claims because most of the investigations Laux cited weren\u2019t specifically about deadly force. Where they were on point, Miller dismissed Laux\u2019s characterization of them as \u201cspeculative.\u201d\n\nIn other words, Miller dismissed the criticism of the LRPD\u2019s internal investigations as irrelevant. He then dismissed any attempt to show a pattern of abuse, misconduct and questionable shootings within the agency by noting that the officers had been cleared by an internal investigation.\n\nLaux even got high-ranking police officials \u2014 including former chief Stuart Thomas \u2014 to admit under oath that some internal investigations overlooked key facts and mistakenly exonerated officers for clear violations. In the shooting of the 67-year-old man by Officer Donna Lesher, for example, Thomas conceded in a deposition years later that the shooting likely did not happen the way Lesher claimed it did. That would seem to be an indication that even Thomas thought that particular investigation was flawed. Instead, Miller wrote only that it \u201csupports an inference that at the time, they accepted a set of facts and reached an incorrect decision.\u201d\n\n\u201cOverall, I think the ruling misses the forest and focuses not just on the trees, but on the branches and the leaves,\u201d Bains said. \u201cThe court distinguishes incident after incident after incident. \u2018These incidents aren\u2019t comparable.\u2019 \u2018The plaintiff\u2019s citing of these other incidents is speculative.\u2019 \u2018These incidents resulted in some discipline\u2019 \u2014 never mind that it was too light to have much effect. But if you step back, the court seems undisturbed by a trove of evidence demonstrating egregious misconduct.\u201d\n\nSuch circular logic makes it nearly impossible for a plaintiff such as Perkins to prevail. If a plaintiff argues that an investigation was botched and the police department disagrees, she\u2019s engaging in speculation. If she can show that even the police chief agrees that an investigation was botched (but only years later, after the officers involved have long been cleared of wrongdoing), that isn\u2019t evidence that the investigative process is flawed but, rather, shows that the department\u2019s leadership is capable of admitting when they got something wrong, thus refuting the argument that they\u2019re indifferent.\n\nWhile the city of Little Rock and the LRPD have so far escaped liability for Bobby Moore\u2019s death, Josh Hastings did not. Last April, a federal jury found that Hastings was liable for Moore\u2019s death and awarded Perkins $415,000 in damages. But Hastings, who now works in construction, can\u2019t pay anything near that amount. He recently filed for bankruptcy. The city of Little Rock conceded that Hastings illegally shot and killed Moore, but also denied any culpability for Hastings\u2019s hiring, training, lax discipline, or the police culture that led to the fatal encounter. The city also refused to indemnify him, virtually assuring that Moore\u2019s family will never collect.\n\nAll of which means that, unless Miller\u2019s ruling is overturned, the only lasting result from Moore\u2019s death will be that Hastings will owe Moore\u2019s family money he can\u2019t pay. But even if he had been convicted in his criminal trial, the city had already designated him a rogue officer. It is unlikely much would have changed. Reform advocates such as Bains say that while it\u2019s important to hold individuals officers accountable \u2014 both civilly and criminally when appropriate \u2014 systemic change usually requires the sort of indictment of an entire police department that can only come from a successful Monell claim or a Justice Department investigation.\n\n\u201cI have both prosecuted individual police officers and conducted investigations into systemic problems,\u201d Bains said. \u201cI think the criminal code is the way we enforce our values as a society, so I think it\u2019s important that officers who commit crimes while using force be held accountable. But I\u2019ll concede that that\u2019s a limited way to bring about lasting change. There are very few examples in which a criminal trial against an officer resulted in broad reforms.\u201d\n\nBains said systemic investigations like those conducted by him and his Obama administration colleagues into the Baltimore, Chicago and Ferguson, Mo., police departments are a better route to reform, together with consent decrees and court enforcement of those agreements. The authority of a federal investigation is a good way of drawing local attention to ongoing problems. Ironically, while such investigations don\u2019t punish individual officers or police leadership, they are incredibly divisive, and seen by police groups and conservatives such as Attorney General Jeff Sessions as imposing federal will on local cops. There is also disagreement in criminal-justice scholarship about whether consent decrees work over the long term.\n\nPerkins takes little comfort in the judgment against Hastings. \u201cThis was never about money,\u201d she said. \u201cThis was about holding the Little Rock police accountable for the death of my baby. For the way they treat people in this city. If the courts don\u2019t want to make them change, we\u2019ll find another way. We\u2019ll keep fighting.\u201d\n\nThomas retired as chief in 2014, and was replaced by Kenton Buckner, previously of the Louisville Metro Police Department. Buckner, who is African American, initially inspired some hope that change would come to Little Rock. Those hopes dissipated after Buckner began publicly feuding with the Little Rock Black Police Officers Association. Buckner first suggested that the group merge with the Fraternal Order of Police, a group that black leaders in Little Rock say has long been part of the \u201cgood ol\u2019 boy\u201d system responsible for LRPD\u2019s problems in the first place.\n\nThen, last November, the head of the LRBPOA sent Buckner a letter drawing attention to a recent department recruit who had used the n-word on his Facebook page. Buckner dismissed the recruit, but then also fired a black recruit for using the same word. Buckner then fired another black recruit for using an offensive word on social media when she was 16 years old. He also suspended Sgt. Willie Davis, who first reported the white recruit\u2019s slur, for going public instead of using the usual chain of command. The discrepancy was not lost on the department\u2019s black officers \u2014 Lt. Johnny Gilbert Jr. had gone up the chain of command about Hastings. He was ignored.\n\nNearly six years after the shooting, Gilbert, the one LRPD official who tried to prevent Josh Hastings\u2019s hiring, seems to be the only Little Rock official who feels any guilt about Moore\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cOh, it haunts me,\u201d Gilbert said. \u201cIt haunts me. I mean, on some level it ought to be self-evident. You don\u2019t hire a police officer who attended a meeting of the Ku Klux Klan. It feels ridiculous to even say it, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nGilbert pauses and rubs his forehead. \u201cI wonder sometimes. What if my memo had been harsher, more strongly worded? What if I had spoke up louder, and more often? I wonder if I had done more, if Bobby Moore would still be alive. But then I remember that this is about more than one officer. It\u2019s about more than Josh Hastings. This is about being better. We\u2019re the police. This is on us. We have to do better.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe problems at the Little Rock Police Department are systemic,\u201d said Griffen, the Pulaski County circuit court judge. \u201cExcessive force, unnecessary shootings, cultural incompetence. These problems are systemic because the city\u2019s leadership refuses to hold the police department accountable. The police are what they are because the elected officials are who they are.\u201d\n\nGriffen fears that without substantive change, Little Rock could erupt the way Ferguson or Baltimore did. But elected officials haven\u2019t seemed interested. And with the Justice Department scaling back oversight, that really just leaves the courts. All of which means a lot could be riding on how the 8th Circuit comes down later this year.\n\n\u201cPolice-community relations here are poor and worsening,\u201d Griffen said. \u201cLittle Rock is running out of time.\u201d", "Players and officials of the English Premier League club Leicester City arrive at a Buddhist temple to participate in the funeral rituals of Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha in Bangkok, Thailand, Sunday, Nov. 4, 2018.

(Rick Bowmer/AP)\n\nOpinion writer\n\nThe jury is out on whether Mitt Romney, the nearly certain winner in the Senate race in Utah, will be a powerful voice challenging President Trump or whether he will, as so many other Republicans have, crumble. However, his essay this week in defense of a free press was as excellent start. As Trump, even after pipe bombs were sent to CNN, was again calling the media the \u201cenemy of the people,\u201d Romney retorted:\n\nAmerica is indebted as a democratic nation to the free press for truths it has uncovered, for truth it has disseminated, and for falsehoods it has repudiated. The press uncovered the government\u2019s lies about the war in Vietnam; it exposed Watergate; it opened our eyes to the sexual abuse of children by priests; and, most recently, it shed a light on the sexual assault by numerous men in power. The free press dispelled the false conspiracies about the 9/11 attacks, President [Barack] Obama\u2019s birth, and Joe McCarthy\u2019s lurking communists. The work of a free press is essential.\n\nRomney quoted Trump\u2019s anti-media vitriol, conceding that attacking the media is a popular Republican tactic. Nevertheless, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee cautioned, \u201cas a political tactic, it may be brilliant, but it comes with a large cost to the cause of freedom.\u201d While accepting that the press is biased, Romney argued, \u201cHumans are biased and the media is populated by humans. The founders knew that the media would be biased; because humans are involved, there is no other way.\u201d\n\nHe concluded, \u201cWe can and should call for accuracy and responsibility in reporting from every member of the press. But a free press, even if biased, was guaranteed in our Constitution because it is critical to the preservation of the Republic. . . . . But I cannot conceive of thinking or saying that the media or any responsible news organization is an enemy. The media is essential to our Republic, to our freedom, to the cause of freedom abroad, and to our national security. It is very much our friend.\u201d\n\nMy only criticism here is that it is ridiculous to speak of \u201cthe press\u201d as one homogeneous blob. Are we speaking of Axios (which irresponsibly ran with Trump\u2019s birthright assertions as though they were fact) or the Wall Street Journal? Breitbart or the Atlantic? The Weekly Standard skews right, but aspires to uphold journalistic standards \u2014 unlike Fox News, which can be considered state TV.\n\nNevertheless, Romney should be credited with responsibly defending the First Amendment. It is good practice for the oath he\u2019ll take to uphold the Constitution (including all the amendments) before entering the Senate. Republicans who think the media really is the enemy of the people and/or support Trump\u2019s assaults on the First Amendment have no business holding public office.\n\nFor reminding conservatives that the press is an essential institution, we can say, well done, Mr. Romney.", "We\u2019re now three days from the 2018 election \u2014 an election in which Republicans appear likely to lose the House. The funny thing is that President Trump seems at peace with that. His late strategy seems to be all about motivating the base for key red-state Senate races. He is focused on that even though that rhetoric seems less helpful \u2014 and possibly even harmful \u2014 in the more endangered chamber, the House.\n\n\u201cIt could happen,\u201d Trump said Friday about losing the House. \u201cAnd you know what you do? My whole life, you know what I say? \u2018Don\u2019t worry about it, I\u2019ll just figure it out.\u2019 Does that make sense? I\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d\n\nAn election analyst might say he is conceding the House.\n\nA conspiracy theorist might say he sees benefit \u2014 personally, at least \u2014 in losing the House.\n\nThere are very obvious downsides to Republicans' losing the House for Trump. Chief among them is that Democrats could leverage their newfound subpoena power to investigate his administration. They could possibly even obtain those tax returns that Trump clearly does not want us to see and expose what the New York Times has said are fraudulent tax schemes.\n\nHe would also be losing the ability to pass legislation without Democratic votes, a setup that gave him a signature tax-cut bill and at least a shot at other victories \u2014 a chance that could vanish the moment Democrats control the agenda in half of Congress.\n\nBut if you are looking at this purely from the vantage point of Trump\u2019s self-interest \u2014 particularly as it relates to winning reelection in 2020 \u2014 there is a compelling case to be made that a Democratic House might be a good thing for the president.\n\nThe first reason is that voters seem to like divided government. Of the last six presidents to win reelection since World War II, only one had complete control of Congress \u2014 George W. Bush in 2004. In 1996, 1988, 1980, 1972, 1968 and 1956, one party controlled all of Congress, but voters picked the other party for the White House.\n\nThe second is that it gives Trump a boogeyman \u2014 or, more apt, a boogeywoman. It\u2019s one thing to campaign against House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) by warning that she could become speaker; it\u2019s another to do so if she is speaker. If Democrats win the House, Trump will have a ready-made foil for his 2020 reelection campaign, even if his Democratic opponent is not such a lightning rod.\n\nTrump could also blame the Democratic House for his continued failures to live up to his many, many promises. (He has already done this to some degree, even though Democrats have no control over any branch of government.) Trump has fulfilled some promises, but key ones and far-fetched ones such as the border wall (not to mention making Mexico pay for it) remain improbable even if Republicans keep control of the House and Senate. If you are going to have gridlock, you might as well have someone on which to blame it who is not in your own party.\n\nAnd, finally, even that subpoena power could pose some tough choices for Democrats. There will be pressure from the party\u2019s base to go after Trump hard and even impeach him, but we\u2019ve seen how that can lead to overreach \u2014 most notably, when Republicans impeached Bill Clinton in the late 1990s. And Democratic leaders have already telegraphed a wariness about that. What happens when they actually have power and the base wants them to go further than they think is prudent? That doesn\u2019t mean they will go too far, but there\u2019s a clear tension.\n\nThis is all speculative, yes. It is just as probable that Trump is campaigning so much for Senate candidates because he and the people around him recognize he is much better as a base motivator than a swing-voter winner. You get more bang for your buck as president campaigning in one of 35 Senate races than in one of 435 House races.\n\nBut it is also true that Trump\u2019s closing message is of much more questionable utility when it comes to saving the House, and he does not seem to care much about that, even though it would ostensibly be a major setback for his agenda. This is also a president who has generally looked out for himself rather than his recently adopted political party, and it is not unreasonable to ask whether he truly cares about the fate of that party \u2014 especially if its setback could be his own personal gain.\n\nAnd even if it is not necessarily something he\u2019s aiming for, it\u2019s possible it could help him.\n\n[Q&A: What midterm races do you want to know more about?

(Library of Congress)\n\nDays before congressional elections in 1874, the unthinkable suddenly seemed likely.\n\nRepublican dominance in Washington had been a fact of life since 1861, when Abraham Lincoln became president and the party held sway on Capitol Hill. With the election of Ulysses S. Grant in 1868, the party remained firmly in control \u2014 and when Grant was reelected four years later in a landslide, the Republican juggernaut seemed unassailable.\n\nBut by the autumn of 1874, the political climate had changed dramatically. An influence-peddling scandal, a depressed economy and lingering Southern white resistance to Reconstruction clouded Republican chances as never before. As Americans prepared to vote in elections that would determine control of the House of Representatives (senators were elected by state legislatures), the end of Republican supremacy in Washington suddenly seemed possible.\n\n\u201cThe complexion of the next House of Representatives,\u201d the Chicago Tribune predicted on Oct. 26, \u201cis likely to be Democratic.\u201d\n\nThat proved to be a colossal understatement.\n\nBy the time all the ballots had been counted, Democrats picked up an astounding 94 seats in the 293-seat House. Republicans retained control of the Senate, but the change in the House represented a sea change in American politics. With the exception of one two-year interval (1881-1883), the House would remain in Democratic control until 1889.\n\n\u201cTo use the familiar rhetoric of this hour of exultation and discomfiture,\u201d the Democratic New York Herald exulted, \u201cwe have the \u2018tidal wave\u2019 or rising sea of success.\u201d\n\nMidterm \u201cwave\u201d elections in which one party sweeps on Capitol Hill while the other controls the White House have been a recurring feature of U.S. politics since the early 19th century, historians say. While Tuesday night didn\u2019t quite bring the \u201cblue wave\u201d Democrats hoped for, the party did seize control of the House, while Republicans held the Senate, in a national referendum on President Trump.\n\nAfter the wave of 1874, many more would follow \u2014 including a notable triumph for Republicans 20 years later.\n\nIn 1894, after a financial meltdown a year earlier and violent labor strife, Republicans gained 130 seats while Democrats shrank from 218 to 93. The election renewed GOP dominance in Washington as Republicans controlled both houses of Congress and the White House.\n\nIn the years that followed, the two parties would take turns surfing midterm waves \u2014 Republicans in 1938, 1946, 1994, 2010 and 2014, and Democrats in 1910, 1958, 1974 and 2006. Earlier this year, pundits foresaw a massive Democratic wave on Election Day, but those predictions have given way to more tempered forecasts.\n\nWhatever happens, it is unlikely to match the wave of 1874.\n\nThe political climate had begun to change even as Grant cruised to his easy reelection in 1872. On Sept. 4, under the headline \u201cThe King of Frauds,\u201d the New York Sun revealed details of a grubby scheme by a Massachusetts congressman to sell valuable stock in a Union Pacific subsidiary to his fellow lawmakers with the intent of promoting the railroad\u2019s interests on Capitol Hill. It became known as the Credit Mobilier scandal and led to three congressional investigations during the winter of 1872-1873. The scandal consumed Washington and embarrassed many of the nation\u2019s most prominent Republicans.\n\nShortly after the investigations concluded, Congress gave itself a retroactive pay raise \u2014 a move that drew immediate and widespread criticism. Even the Republican New York Times was outraged by what soon became widely known as the \u201csalary grab.\u201d \u201cThe public will not readily forget a piece of rascality so shameless, so despicable, and so conspicuous,\u201d the Times thundered.\n\nEconomic catastrophe added to Republican difficulties. The Panic of 1873 shook Wall Street, closed banks and coal mines, bankrupted railroads and led to widespread unemployment. Hoping to revive the economy, Congress responded with legislation to inflate the currency, but Grant stunned the nation by vetoing the bill. The Herald, reflecting Wall Street\u2019s conservative views about monetary policy, applauded the veto but noted that it elevated \u201cthe currency controversy into the foreground as the overshadowing issue of American politics.\u201d\n\n\n\nAn illustration from Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper showing the scene on Wall Street on Sept. 20, 1873, after the New York Stock Exchange closes. (Library of Congress)\n\nThere were other factors at play as well. The massacre of 50 African Americans defending a Republican-controlled county government in Louisiana in 1873 and an ongoing struggle between Republicans and Democrats to control the state government kept Reconstruction in the headlines. White Southerners who violently opposed the enfranchisement of former slaves flocked to the Democratic Party, while many white Northerners were growing weary with the Republican commitment to protecting the rights of newly freed slaves.\n\nIn addition, reports that Grant was pondering whether to seek a third term in 1876 \u2014 and in so doing disregarding the tradition of presidents serving only eight years \u2014 alarmed many in both parties and reinforced fears that the general who led the North to victory in the Civil War favored dictatorial \u201cCaesarism\u201d over democratic government.\n\nAll of this created a challenging environment for Republicans. Vice President Henry Wilson admitted as much to the Herald on Aug. 19. He conceded the party would be unable to match its performance in 1872 and urged Republicans to unite. \u201cWe require to use all our strength, for our antagonists are watching and wary, and although they have several times committed faults, we must not expect them to perpetuate them. They are preparing to make a strong effort to achieve victory in the coming struggle, and we must, if we hope to succeed, be up and doing.\u201d\n\nFew of his fellow Republicans shared his worries. \u201cMany simply had grown so accustomed to office that they couldn\u2019t imagine America without them in charge,\u201d historian H.W. Brands has written. One Republican who avoided complacency was Rep. James A. Garfield of Ohio, who began his campaign well over a year before he faced reelection as he circulated a monograph in his district defending his conduct regarding Credit Mobilier. He refunded his pay increase and dutifully campaigned in hamlets and market towns throughout his district as the election approached. His efforts paid off \u2014 aided by a divided opposition that put up two candidates to run against him, biographer Allan Peskin notes.\n\nMany others were not so lucky. \u201cRarely has an American political party suffered a defeat on the scale that the Republican Party did in 1874,\u201d historian Richard White writes. By White\u2019s reckoning, Republicans \u201cwent from a 70 percent majority to a 37 percent minority in one election.\u201d\n\n\n\nRep. Benjamin Butler as portrayed by cartoonist Thomas Nast on the cover of Harper's Weekly, April 11, 1874. (Library of Congress)\n\nOne of the most notable defeats came in Massachusetts, with Republican Rep. Benjamin Butler. Notable for his droopy eye, fondness for capes and an unusual gait likened by one colleague to \u201ca bass walking on its tail,\u201d Butler had been at the center of many of the political dramas of the past decade, including the impeachment trial of President Andrew Johnson. He was also the author of the controversial pay raise bill \u2014 and his constituents were in no mood to reward him for it.\n\n\u201cEverything was against us, especially the hard times,\u201d Republican Rep. Luke Potter Poland of Vermont told the St. Louis Globe on Nov. 11. But economic hardship wasn\u2019t the only factor powering the wave, Poland noted. The \u201cpeople got disgusted with the daily revelations of corruption and fraud, and they concluded to hold the party in power responsible for them all.\u201d\n\nDemocrats saw that too and used their new majority accordingly. A House investigation led to the resignation and impeachment of Secretary of War William Belknap and uncovered shady dealings in the Navy and Interior departments. The investigations \u2014 together with revelations of a Whiskey \u201cring\u201d in the Treasury Department that connived with distillers to avoid taxes \u2014 tarred the Grant administration\u2019s reputation but did little to help Democrats, according to historian Mark Wahlgren Summers.\n\nThe reason was a political problem as familiar as the wave election itself, according to a New York Democratic operative quoted by Summers. \u201cIn the estimation of the public generally,\u201d S.L.M. Barlow wrote, \u201cour investigations are looked upon as partisan and useless.\u201d\n\nRead more Retropolis:\n\nHow an abduction by the mysterious Freemasons led to a third political party \u2014 the nation\u2019s first\n\n\u2018A party that had lost its mind\u2019: In 1968, Democrats held one of history\u2019s most disastrous conventions\n\nThe fake letter historians believe tipped a presidential election\n\nHow not being a father made George Washington the father of his country\n\n\u2018Kill the beast\u2019: The impeachment trial that nearly took down a president 150 years ago", "With a national election coming up, and with the publicity at its maximum, now is a good time to ask: Is it rational for you to vote?

The Democrats are leading in the polls and are expected to take back the House, but there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty in the outcome; for example, fivethirtyeight.com gives a 2 percent chance of the election leading to a 218-217 split, excluding your vote. Now suppose you live in a swing district with a tight race that could go either way; say, roughly, it could go anywhere from 45-55 percent to 55-45 percent in terms of the two-party vote, and also suppose that 200,000 people will be voting in your district. Then the vote margin in your district could be anywhere between +20,000 to -20,000, and, if you decide to vote, the chance of your vote being decisive in then roughly 1 in 40,000. Your vote will determine who controls the House if your vote determines your local House election, and if your representative is required to form a majority for his or her party; the probability of both these things happening is, according to the above calculations, approximately 2 percent times 1/40,000, or 1 in 2 million.\n\nYou can do a similar calculation for the Senate, if you happen to live in a state with a close Senate election. Your best bet may well be North Dakota, which has the sweet spot of a close election and a small population. FiveThirtyEight gives a 15 percent chance of the Senate being exactly tied. North Dakota will have, I dunno, 300,000 voters \u2014 its Senate race had 230,000 votes in 2010. If the election could be anywhere from 45-55 to 55-45, that gives a probability of 1/60,000 that it\u2019s tied. Multiply 15 percent times 1/60,000, and you get 1 in 250,000. So it\u2019s still a long shot.\n\nSimilarly, we estimated a few years ago that the probability your vote is decisive in the presidential election is, at best, 1 in a million in a battleground state and much less in a noncompetitive state. The calculation is based on the chance that your state\u2019s vote will be exactly tied, along with the chance that your state\u2019s electoral votes are necessary for one party or the other to secure an electoral vote majority. Both of these conditions are necessary for your vote to be decisive.\n\nSo voting might at first not seem like such a good use of your time.\n\nBut here\u2019s the good news. If your vote is decisive, it will make a difference for 300 million people. If you think your preferred candidate could bring the equivalent of a $100 improvement in the quality of life to the average American \u2014 not an implausible hope, given the size of the federal budget and the impact of decisions in foreign policy, health, the courts and other areas \u2014 you\u2019re now buying a $30 billion lottery ticket. With this payoff, a 1 in 10 million chance of being decisive isn\u2019t bad odds.\n\nAnd many people do see it that way. Surveys show that voters choose based on who they think will do better for the country as a whole, rather than their personal betterment. Indeed, when it comes to voting, it is irrational to be selfish \u2014 but if you care how others are affected, it\u2019s a smart calculation to cast your ballot, because the returns to voting are so high for everyone if you are decisive. Voting and vote choice (including related actions such as the decision to gather information to make an informed vote) are rational in large elections only to the extent that voters are not selfish.\n\nThat\u2019s also the reason for contributing money to a candidate: Large contributions, or contributions to local elections, could conceivably be justified as providing access or the opportunity to directly influence policy. But small-dollar contributions to national elections, like voting, can be better motivated by the possibility of large social benefit than by any direct benefit to you. Such civically motivated behavior is consistent with both small and large anonymous contributions to charity.\n\nThe social benefit from voting also explains the declining response rates in opinion polls. In the 1950s, when mass opinion polling was rare, we would argue that it was more rational to respond to a survey than to vote in an election. For example, as one of 1,000 respondents to a Gallup poll, there was a real chance that your response could noticeably affect the poll numbers (for example, changing a poll result from 49 percent to 50 percent). Nowadays, polls are so common that a telephone poll was done recently to estimate how often individuals are surveyed; the answer was about once per year. It is thus unlikely that a response to a single survey will have much impact.\n\nSo, yes, if you are in a state that might be close, it is rational to vote.\n\nFor further details, see our articles in Rationality and Society and the Economist\u2019s Voice.\n\nI\u2019d like to add one more thing. You\u2019ve all heard about low voter turnout in America, but among well-educated, older white people, turnout is around 90 percent in presidential elections. Some economists treat this as a source of amusement \u2014 and, sure, I\u2019d be the first to admit that well-educated, older white people have done a lot of damage to this country. But it\u2019s a funny thing: Usually economists tend not to question the actions of this particular demographic. I\u2019m not saying that the high turnout of these people (like me) is evidence that voting is rational. But I would hope that it would cause some economists to think twice before characterizing voting as irrational or laughable.\n\nAnd, no, it\u2019s not true that \u201cthe closer an election is, the more likely that its outcome will be taken out of the voters\u2019 hands.\u201d See the appendix on the last page of this article for a full explanation, with calculus!\n\nBut what if you live somewhere where there\u2019s no close House or Senate race? Then, yes, there\u2019s essentially zero chance your vote will be decisive in determining control of Congress. In the highly unlikely event that your state or local election is tied so that your vote would swing it, the national election would be so lopsided that your state or district wouldn\u2019t be needed for a national majority. That is the sort of reasoning why we estimated the probability that your vote would swing the presidential election to be less than 1 in 1 billion in states such as New York, California, Kansas or Alabama.", "\n\nCentral American migrants wait Oct. 29 at Paso del Norte International Bridge in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico, for a chance to enter the United States. (Herika Martinez/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nAs attention focuses on a migrant caravan moving north through Mexico, communities along the border in Texas are scrambling to help hundreds of Central American families already arriving there each week.\n\n\u201cThis is the third surge [of migrants] that we\u2019ve seen over the past three years. Clearly it is the highest, the largest surge that we\u2019ve seen,\u201d said Ruben Garcia, the founder and executive director of Annunciation House, an El Paso nonprofit that has cared for migrants for 40 years.\n\nAt the Paso del Norte bridge connecting El Paso and Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico, hundreds of Central American parents and children camp out each night, waiting for the chance to apply for asylum at the port of entry. Hundreds more families cross between ports, requesting asylum after being apprehended by Border Patrol agents.\n\nThe migrant families are initially detained in holding cells at the bridge or at Border Patrol stations. Built to detain people for a few hours for processing, the holding cells have been used in recent weeks to house 20 or more people at a time for up to three days. Some families have reported being moved from one cell to another, sometimes spending a week or more in detention before being released.\n\n\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection agents keep watch at Paso del Norte International Bridge. (Jose Luis Gonzalez/Reuters)\n\nIn El Paso, Immigration and Customs Enforcement releases about 2,100 people per week to Annunciation House, which works with area churches to shelter and feed migrant families as they await transportation to join relatives elsewhere in the United States. The rate of release has tripled in the past month, leading Annunciation House to increase the number of churches it relies on.\n\nGarcia said his aim is to create \u201cequilibrium\u201d by increasing Annunciation House\u2019s capacity to match the number of migrant families being detained in holding cells. His agency rents two El Paso motels at a cost of $38,000 a week to help meet increased demand.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to build capacity to be able to end the practice of using these cells as temporary detention sites, where people are bunched up in ways that is very inappropriate and not healthy,\u201d he said.\n\nGarcia said more space should also cut the need for families to sleep on the Mexican side of the bridge as they wait to apply for asylum in the United States. Customs and Border Protection officers have been regularly denying entry to would-be asylum seekers since spring, claiming ports of entry lack the capacity to process more people. The number of people camping on the bridge, however, has started to rise only over the past couple of weeks.\n\n\n\nMigrants pray at an Annunciation House shelter Oct. 13 in El Paso. (Mario Tama/Getty Images)\n\nOvernight temperatures in the El Paso-Ju\u00e1rez region regularly dip into the 40s this time of year.\n\nRoger Maier, a CBP spokesman in El Paso, said: \u201cCBP facilities are temporary holding facilities where people are not held for more than 72 hours except in rare, extenuating circumstances. It is a priority of our agency to process and transfer all individuals in our custody to the appropriate longer-term detention agency as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nThe cost of caring for the migrant families after their release is borne by churches and Annunciation House donors. The government contributes no money to the effort.\n\nHundreds of volunteers have flocked to the shelters over the past week, Garcia said.\n\n\u201cIt is their commitment that I truly believe personifies, exemplifies, what it really means to be a citizen of the United States,\u201d he said.\n\nCBP statistics show that apprehensions at the border are rising over 2017 levels but still well below the numbers seen in the 1990s and 2000s. The number of families apprehended, however, is at record levels, with 16,658 members of \u201cfamily units\u201d taken into custody in September at the southwest border.\n\nOfficials said 2,676 of those apprehensions came in the Border Patrol\u2019s El Paso sector. That was second only to the Rio Grande Valley, where 8,782 members of family units were apprehended.\n\nSister Norma Pimentel, executive director of Catholic Charities of the Rio Grande Valley, said her shelter at Sacred Heart Catholic Church in McAllen is now taking in 500 migrant family members a day following their release by immigration officials \u2014 up from about 150 a day in late summer.\n\n\n\nSister Norma Pimentel greets women who were released from detention this summer at a shelter in McAllen, Tex.

She said aid workers were in the Rukban area.\n\nBefore January, aid only reached the camp from Jordan and aid workers were barred from accessing the camp because of security concerns.\n\nThe Arab Syrian Red Crescent and the United Nations posted pictures of staff unloading trucks of life-saving assistance and administering vaccines to children.\n\nResidents posed with the aid trucks driving through the desolate camp, where 10,000 children are expected to be vaccinated.\n\nThe U.S.-led coalition fighting against Islamic State militants said its local allies, a Syrian armed group known as Maghawir al-Thawra, provided security for the aid convoys.\n\nResident Abdul-Fatah al-Khaled, who also runs a camp school, said aid workers, including U.N. staff, were on the ground at the camp for the first time.\n\n\u201cBefore (January) the aid used to be distributed from the Jordanian side over the sand berms\u201d or by rebel groups who resided in the camp, al-Khaled said.\n\nAl-Khaled said distribution of food and winter clothes began late Saturday.\n\nPeople started gathering in Rukban three years ago, fleeing IS militants and airstrikes by the U.S.-led coalition, Russia and Syria. Jordan sealed its border and stopped regular aid deliveries in 2016 after a cross-border IS attack that killed seven Jordanian soldiers. The attack, and other violence, fueled accusations that militants were hiding among camp residents and raised concern that deteriorating humanitarian conditions amounted to collective punishment.\n\nThe last aid delivery from Jordan was in January, leaving the camp\u2019s residents dependent on goods largely smuggled from government-held areas. The situation sharply deteriorated after the Syrian government blocked supply routes last month following a botched reconciliation deal with rebel groups in the area.\n\nRussia, a close ally of the Syrian government, has blamed the U.S. for the deterioration of the situation in Rukban, which is within a 55-square kilometer (20 sq. mile) \u201cdeconfliction zone\u201d set up by U.S. forces stationed in the nearby Tanf military base.\n\nThe U.S.-led coalition has denied such allegations and blamed Russia and the Syrian government instead.\n\n\u201cWe continue to stand ready to enable future delivery of U.N. humanitarian relief to the people of Rukban until they are able to return home as we pursue our mission of an enduring defeat of (IS),\u201d said Maj.

That marks a slight decline from last month, when Democrats led on the generic congressional ballot by 11 points, and a bigger drop from August, when they enjoyed a 14-point advantage.\n\nDemocrats also have a 51-to- 44 percent advantage among likely voters identified by The Post. That seven-point margin, which is in line with other polls taken in the past two weeks, puts Democrats roughly within range of what they probably will need in the overall national vote for the House to capture a majority from the Republicans, based on calculations from previous midterm campaigns.\n\n[Read full poll results| Detailed crosstabs ]\n\nHowever, there is no way to translate the national numbers into the district-by-district competition that will ultimately decide who controls the House in January. Democrats need a net gain of 23 seats to capture control of the House. Public and private polls of individual races conducted by candidates, political party committees, the media and others show many contests still within the margin of error.\n\nRepublican candidates in competitive House districts, almost a third of which backed Hillary Clinton in 2016, threaten to be dragged down by the president\u2019s unpopularity. Presidents with approval ratings as low as Trump\u2019s have generally suffered significant losses in midterm elections. But this president has shown over time that historical statistical benchmarks don\u2019t always apply to him.\n\nTrump\u2019s approval rating among all adults stands at 40 percent, holding steady from a poll in early October and slightly higher than his 36 percent rating in August. Those who disapprove account for 53 percent. Among registered voters, Trump\u2019s approval is 44 percent, with disapproval at 52 percent, the best margin among this group during his presidency.\n\nAll midterm elections are a referendum on the incumbent president, and Trump has made this election about himself more than most presidents have, insisting in his campaign rallies that voters should approach the election as if he is on the ballot. But elections also tend to reflect views of the economy, and Tuesday\u2019s provides a test of the tension between perceptions of the president and perceptions of the economy. Rarely has there been as great a distance between views about the economy and a president\u2019s ratings as there is this year.\n\nOn Friday, the Labor Department\u2019s monthly employment report produced a string of positive numbers: another month with the unemployment rate at 3.7 percent, the lowest in half a century; 250,000 jobs added to the workforce; and wages posting the biggest increase in almost a decade and faster than inflation.\n\nThe Post-ABC News poll was conducted Monday through Thursday, the day before the employment statistics were announced, and records the most optimistic attitudes about the economy in nearly two decades, with 65 percent of all Americans rating the state of the economy as good or excellent and 34 percent offering a negative assessment. The last time optimism ranked so high was in January 2001.\n\nAmong registered voters, 71 percent say the economy is good or excellent, up from 60 percent in August. Those who give the economy positive ratings favor Republican candidates for the House by 54 to 40 percent, wider than the 49 to 42 percent margin in August.\n\nSimilarly, more than 8 in 10 adults say they are either doing about as well financially as they were before Trump became president (60 percent), or are doing better (25 percent). Just 13 percent say they are not as well off. That 13 percent figure is also among the lowest in 18 years; the last time it dropped that low was in the final year of President Bill Clinton\u2019s administration, when a boom in technology fueled a rising economy.\n\nRepublican candidates have tried to emphasize the economy in their campaigns, but they have sometimes been overwhelmed by presidential rhetoric and by sharp attacks by Democrats on the issue of health care, which have put them on the defensive.\n\nThe president has used the final weeks of the midterm campaign to hammer on immigration more than any other issue. He has warned of threats to the country from a caravan of Central Americans who are in southern Mexico and heading north. He has ordered federal troops to be deployed to the border in response.\n\nEarlier last week, Trump promoted an incendiary video highlighting an unrepentant undocumented immigrant who killed two law enforcement officials. The video sought to make him a face of the migrant caravan, even though he is in prison, and to blame Democrats for his acts. Democrats in turn denounced the ad as racist.\n\nThe president\u2019s focus on immigration appears to have raised the importance of the issue in the minds of his party\u2019s voters ahead of Tuesday\u2019s voting. Since a Post-ABC News poll three weeks ago, the share of Republicans saying immigration is \u201cone of the most important issues\u201d in their vote has grown from 14 percent to 21 percent. The share of Democrats saying immigration is a top issue has dropped from 23 percent to 11 percent.\n\nWhen all voters were asked which party they trust more to handle immigration, Democrats were slightly favored by 47 to 42 percent over Republicans. But on border security, which has been the principal focus of the president, Republicans are more trusted by 49 percent to 39 percent.\n\nThose who rank immigration as one of the most important issues in the election favor Republicans over Democrats by 12 points when choosing a generic congressional candidate, though the gap among this group is tenuous given its large error margin. For those who say border security is one of their top issues, Republicans lead Democrats by 42 points on the House vote.\n\nThose groups who have shifted toward Republicans on the issues of immigration since early October include white men without college degrees, voters over age 65 and voters who live in rural areas \u2014 all staples of the coalition that elected the president two years ago.\n\nDemocrats hold a lead almost as large \u2014 39 points \u2014 among those voters who rank health care as one of the single most important issues. They lead by 69 points among those for whom global warming is one of the most important issues and by 46 points among those who say reducing divisions in the country is a top issue.\n\nOverall, 17 percent of voters consider health care and reducing the country\u2019s divisions as among the single most important issues \u2014 about the same as the economy (15 percent) and immigration (14 percent). When looking more broadly at issues voters say are at least \u201cvery important,\u201d health care and the economy top the list at 78 percent and 76 percent, respectively, followed by reducing political divisions, immigration, taxes, border security and global warming.\n\nPresidential approval correlates closely to how people vote and the poll underscores that relationship, with 87 percent of those who approve of Trump saying they support Republicans for the House and 88 percent of those who disapprove saying they prefer Democratic House candidates.\n\nAnother measure of the polarization of the electorate is the relationship between party identification and voting intentions. In this survey, 94 percent of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents favor GOP House candidates, and an identical percentage of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say they favor candidates from their party.\n\nGender and education continue to be dividing lines in the electorate. On the vote for the House, men are split 47 to 46 percent in favor of GOP candidates, while women back Democratic candidates by 54 to 40 percent. White women with college degrees favor Democratic House candidates by 16 points and white men with college degrees back the Democrats by 14 points. Among whites without college degrees, men favor Republicans by 39 points and women by 12 points.\n\nYoung voters ages 18-39, who historically have turned out at much lower rates in midterm elections than older voters, show a wide preference for Democrats, by 58 to 35 percent. Those between age 40 and those over age 65 are nearly evenly divided.\n\nAmong those who say they are certain to vote or already have voted, Democrats enjoy a nine-point advantage, while those who say they probably will vote or that the chances are \u201c50-50\u201d tip toward Republicans by four points, with 10 percent undecided.\n\nThe Post-ABC News poll was conducted Oct. 29-Nov. 1 among a random national sample of 1,255 adults, with 65 percent reached on cellphones and 35 percent on landlines. Overall results have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points; the error margin is 3.5 points among the sample of 1,041 registered voters and four points among the sample of 737 likely voters.\n\nEmily Guskin contributed to this report.", "MADRID \u2014 A jury in Spain found a Brazilian man guilty of killing his aunt, uncle and two young cousins and ruled unanimously that the slayings were premeditated, a Spanish news agency reported.\n\nThe jury at the trial in Guadalajara, near Madrid, was not convinced Saturday by Patrick Nogueira\u2019s defense that he had stabbed his relatives because he was mentally disturbed and suffers from alcoholism, the private news agency Europa Press reported.\n\nNogueira\u2019s aunt and uncle were in their early forties and his cousins were 1 and 4 years old at the time of the 2016 slayings.

Highs: Mid-to-upper 50s.\n\nTonight: Increasing clouds, showers by morning. Lows: Upper 40s to near 50.\n\nTomorrow: Overcast with rain likely. Highs: Mid-to-upper 50s.\n\nView the current weather at The Washington Post headquarters.\n\nFORECAST IN DETAIL\n\nIt may look a little brighter as you wake up today, but it will surely be a little darker by dinner time as we return the ol\u2019 standard time. The fall of daylight saving aside, we\u2019re looking at a nice day of sun and 50s. Make the most of it since the next couple of days look unsettled at times, as a storm system cranks up in the middle part of the country, sending us some warmth but also plenty of shower chances through midweek.\n\nGet our daily forecasts on your Amazon Alexa device. Click here to find out how.\n\nToday (Sunday): It\u2019s a few degrees cooler, but without the breeze, it\u2019s a day to enjoy. High pressure is firmly overhead, so we\u2019re looking at another mostly sunny day, with chilly morning temperatures rising into the 40s, and cool afternoon highs in the mid-to-upper 50s. It also means that our winds have relaxed to a more manageable 5 to 10 mph, coming out of the east. Confidence: High\n\nTonight: Skies see increasing clouds this evening before turning mostly cloudy overnight. A warm front closes in, and with more easterly flow, areas of light rain and some pockets of fog/mist become more and more likely toward morning. Temperatures remain fairly steady overnight, only cooling to the upper 40s to around 50. Confidence: Medium-High\n\nFollow us on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram for the latest updates.

Otherwise we\u2019re overcast with winds continuing from the east-northeast and areas fog and mist. Highs are once again held to the mid-to-upper 50s. Confidence: Medium\n\nTomorrow night: Mostly cloudy skies linger, but the next batch of rain should hold off. Temperatures are fairly steady in the 50s. Confidence: Medium\n\nA LOOK AHEAD\n\nA powerful storm system winds up across the Great Lakes on Tuesday, leaving us warm and unstable. That means a good chance of showers and perhaps a rumble of thunder, although the timing of rain is uncertain, with highs rising to the mid-60s to near 70. That system drags a cold front through during the evening, with a few more showers likely and possibly a thunderstorm. We should see clearing skies later Tuesday night with lows in the upper 40s to mid-50s. Confidence: Medium\n\nIt\u2019s a little cooler on Wednesday, but the true cold push lags behind a bit. So, we get the post-cold front sun, and still hold on to the mild air. Nice! We may have a few gusts to deal with from time to time, but it\u2019s a small price to pay for a mostly sunny day with highs in the 60s.

In fact, he kind of likes it.\n\n\u201cPeople say my inventions are useless, but I think there are two dimensions to usefulness: practicality and amusement,\u201d said the 30-year-old former welder, who left his job last year to focus full time on making his questionable contraptions, such as a motorbike with its own toilet. \u201cI like doing this. So it\u2019s useful.\u201d\n\nEvery country has its toolshed inventors. But China \u2014 which gave the world movable type printing, gunpowder and the compass \u2014 has spawned a population of tinkerers who display the kind of outsize ambition that has helped the country become a global economic giant.\n\nThere\u2019s a surprisingly large subset of farmers and other DIY devotees who have built submarines and light aircraft, various kinds of robotic plows and monster truck-style tractors.\n\nGeng may now be the best-known among them \u2014 a new kind of social media star whose calling card is his quirkiness.\n\nStanding in his workshop in this tiny village outside Beijing, Geng shows off his inventions.

Perfect, he says, for storing your phone, keys and wallet. It has a strap so it can hang over the wearer\u2019s shoulder.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very fashionable,\u201d he said, with apparent seriousness, modeling his creation. \u201cAnd if someone tries to steal your bag, you can just throw it at them.\u201d\n\n[China\u2019s new booze university wants to change how Americans drink ]\n\nBut Geng, who grew up making things in his family\u2019s pump factory, is a special kind of Chinese entrepreneur.

It said one person survived the flood late Saturday night by clinging to a tree, and that the victims were from two families spending the weekend together. (Igor Petyx/ANSA via AP) (Associated Press)\n\nROME \u2014 Storm-related floods killed at least 12 people in Sicily, Italian authorities said Sunday, including nine members of two families who were spending a long weekend together when water and mud from a swollen river overran their rented villa.\n\nAfter surveying the stricken Mediterranean island by helicopter, Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte identified two more of the victims as a German couple whose car was swept away by flood waters near Agrigento, a tourist town known for its ancient Greek temples.\n\nItalian news reports said a 1-year--old, a 3-year-old and a teenager were among the flood victims from the family get-together in Casteldaccia. A survivor, Giuseppe Giordano, lost his wife, two of his children, his parents and a brother, Italian news agency ANSA said.\n\nState broadcaster RaiNews24 said Giordano was stepping outside on Saturday night when the torrent rushed in and described him as the sole person to made it out alive.\n\nWhen he opened the door, \u201cthere was a river of water, I was knocked down and grabbed hold of a tree,\u201d Giordano told reporters between sobs. \u201cI was yelling, \u2018Help, help.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cMy son Federico tried to save his little sister, but both died,\u201d Giordano said, telling reporters he heard his son call out \u201cI handle\u201d about the girl\u2019s rescue.\n\nThen \u201cI saw the windows go dark, the light go out, a layer of mud was moving across the floor,\u201d Giordano said, Then, he said he was swept away from the house by the force of the water.\n\nThe two families had gathered in the villa during Italy\u2019s long weekend centering on the Nov. 1 All Saint\u2019s Day national holiday.\n\nAlthough Italian news reports originally described him of the house\u2019s owner, Giordano said he was renting the villa.\n\nCasteldaccia Mayor Giovanni Di Giacinto told Sky TG24 that the flood water reached 2 meters (move than 6 feet) high inside the home.\n\nRescuers retrieved the bodies from the home. A Sicilian prosecutor opened an investigation to determine if neglect, such as possible inadequate drainage of the river, played a role in the deaths or if the home was built illegally close to the river.\n\nThe latter might be the case. Pino Virga, the mayor of the neighboring town of Altavilla Milicia, told SkyTG24 TV that other local authorities told him the house was slated for demolition because it stood too near the river.\n\nSeparately, Di Giacinto told reporters the homeowner had blocked the demolition by challenging it in a local tribunal.\n\nA nursing home up the road was spared any damage, ANSA reported.\n\nOnly days earlier, other storms battered much of northern Italy, killing at least 15 people, uprooting millions of trees near Alpine valleys and leaving several Italian villages without electricity or road access for days.\n\nConte said a special Cabinet meeting could be in the coming days to deliberate aid for storm-ravaged communities, as well as to approve 1 billion euros ($1.15 billion) to ensure safe hydrogeological conditions in Italy, including proper cleaning of riverbeds.\n\nThe other known casualty in Sicily was a man whose body was also found on a guardrail along a Palermo-area road after floodwaters swept away his car, Italian news reports said.\n\nAcross the island, in the town of Cammarata, near Agrigento, the fire department said its divers worked to recover the bodies of the couple whose car was caught up in the flooding waters of the Saraceno River.\n\nAlso in Agrigento province, firefighters rescued 14 people from a hotel in the town of Montevago, which was threatened by floodwaters from the Belice River.\n\nElsewhere in Sicily, at least two other people were missing Sunday after floodwaters swept away their cars, including a doctor heading to the hospital in the hill town of Corleone.\n\nIn Casteldaccia, Maria Concetta Alfano said she, her husband and their adult disabled daughter fled after barking dogs drew their attention to the rising waters in the Milicia River.

Bibi plans to leave the country, her family said Thursday, as Islamists mounted rallies demanding Bibi be publicly hanged, and also called for the killing of the three judges, including Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nisar, who acquitted Bibi. (Associated Press)\n\nMULTAN, Pakistan \u2014 The husband of a Christian woman acquitted eight years after being sentenced to death for blasphemy, but not released after countrywide protests, appealed on Sunday to U.S. President Donald Trump and British Prime Minister Theresa May to help the family leave Pakistan.\n\nAsia Bibi\u2019s husband, Ashiq Masih, in a brief video message said they were in danger in Pakistan.\n\n\u201cPlease help us, we are in trouble in Pakistan,\u201d Masih appealed to Trump and May. Masih had previously told The Associated Press by phone that he and his wife feared for their lives. \u201cWe are now living under an increased sense of fear.\u201d\n\nBibi\u2019 lawyer Saiful Malook has already fled the country for safety.\n\nBibi was arrested in 2009 after she was accused of blasphemy following a quarrel with two fellow female farm workers who refused to drink from a water container used by a Christian. A few days later, a mob accused her of insulting Islam\u2019s prophet, leading to her 2010 conviction. Bibi\u2019s family has always maintained her innocence and says she never insulted the prophet.\n\nInsulting Islam is punishable by death in Pakistan, and the mere rumor of doing so can incite lynchings.\n\nPakistan\u2019s top court acquitted Bibi on Wednesday of the charges carrying the death penalty, infuriating hard-line Islamists who held three days of nationwide protests demanding her execution. The enraged protesters torched scores of vehicles, blocked highways and attacked government and public property; a radical cleric also threatened to kill the three judges who acquitted Bibi. The protests ended after the government agreed to impose a travel ban on Bibi and allow her case to be reviewed. A review petition was filed in the Supreme Court.\n\nEarlier in the day, police said over 150 people were arrested on charges of arson, vandalism and violence during the protests.\n\nSenior police officer Nayab Haider said that police were using video clips to identify those involved in assaults, torching property and vehicles, and blocking highways.\n\nDefending the police\u2019s actions, Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry said the government cannot spare those involved in violence.

The cockpit voice recorder has not been recovered but searchers are focusing on a particular area based on a weak locator signal.\n\nNational Search and Rescue Agency chief Muhammad Syaugi said Sunday the search operation, now in its 7th day and involving hundreds of personnel and dozens of ships, would continue for another three days.\n\nSyaugi paid tribute to a volunteer diver, Syahrul Anto, who died during the search effort on Friday. The family of the 48-year-old refused an autopsy and he was buried Saturday in Surabaya.\n\nMore than 100 body bags of human remains had been recovered. Syaugi said the number would continue to increase and remains were also now washing up on land.\n\nHe said weak signals, potentially from the cockpit voice recorder, were traced to a location but an object hadn\u2019t been found yet due to deep seabed mud.\n\nFlight tracking websites show the plane had erratic speed and altitude during its 13 minute flight and a previous flight the day before from Bali to Jakarta.

The ban was completely lifted in June. The U.S. lifted a decadelong ban in 2016.\n\nLion Air is one of Indonesia\u2019s youngest airlines but has grown rapidly, flying to dozens of domestic and international destinations.

(Screenshot via Twitter)\n\n\"Democrats let him [police killer Luis Bracamontes] into our country \u2026 Democrats let him stay \u2026. Who else would Democrats let in?\u201d\n\n\u2014 campaign ad tweeted by President Trump, Oct. 31, 2018\n\nPresident Trump has sought to focus the midterm elections on what he describes as the national security threat posed by several thousand migrants making a 1,000-mile trek from Honduras through Mexico to the southern border with the United States. As part of his closing message, he tweeted a campaign video that features Luis Bracamontes, an undocumented immigrant who was convicted of shooting to death two California police officers in 2014.\n\nAs video of the smirking Bracamontes, who boasts that he would kill more police if he could, and scenes of Central American migrants appear, the ad pins all of the blame for the killings on Democrats. The ad concludes: \u201cPresident Donald Trump and Republicans are making America safe again.\u201d\n\nThis narrative has a big problem: It\u2019s false.\n\nThe Facts\n\nThere\u2019s often a problem with using a single anecdote to illustrate a societal issue. We\u2019ve documented that there is no evidence that illegal immigrants cause more crime than U.S. citizens; in fact, immigrants in general have lower rates of crime than U.S. citizens. Of course, just as there are cop killers who are citizens, there are cop killers who are undocumented immigrants. But that does not mean undocumented immigrants kill police at a higher rate than do U.S. citizens.\n\nThe campaign ad claims that Democrats are responsible for Bracamontes being in the United States. But here\u2019s what really happened, according to a review of the court records by the Arizona Republic and the Sacramento Bee that show his case was handled primarily by Republicans.\n\nBracamontes, who is from Mexico, snuck into the United States and was arrested in 1996 for drug possession as part of a narcotics sting. He spent four months in the tent city erected by then-Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio before he was released to immigration authorities. (Arpaio, of course, is known for his hard-line immigration policies and was pardoned by Trump last year after the former sheriff was convicted of ignoring a federal judge\u2019s order.)\n\nBracamontes was sentenced to three years' probation, but his sentence had barely begun when he was deported in 1997, when Bill Clinton was president.\n\nBracamontes snuck back in the United States and was arrested again in 1998. Apparently he was not deported after being turned over to immigration authorities.\n\nBracamontes was arrested in 2001 on drug and weapons charges, released by immigration authorities and then arrested again a few months later.\n\nBracamontes was then deported a second time \u2014 in 2001, when George W. Bush was president.\n\nBracamontes snuck back in the United States, and records show he was married in Maricopa County on Feb. 28, 2002. Bush was still president.\n\nBracamontes moved to Utah under an assumed name and had a terrible driving record, earning 10 misdemeanor violations from 2003 to 2009. But he somehow escaped the notice of immigration authorities.\n\nStarting in 2008, under both Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, the Secure Communities program was launched and expanded. The program was intended to identify undocumented immigrants who had been convicted of a crime, sentenced to imprisonment and who may be eligible for deportation.\n\nIn August 2011, three years before the murders of the California police officers, Maricopa County Attorney Bill Montgomery\u2019s office recommended the court dismiss Bracamontes\u2019 2001 case. Attorneys said it was \u201cin the best interest of the court.\u201d Montgomery is a Republican.\n\nIn 2014, Bracamontes and his wife went on a methamphetamine-fueled trip that resulted in the murders of the police officers and the subsequent convictions of Bracamontes, for the killings, and his wife, Janelle Monroy, for assisting him. In April, Bracamontes was sentenced to death.\n\nThe Pinocchio Test\n\nTrump\u2019s ad claims that Democrats let Bracamontes in and that they let him stay. But the reality is that he snuck over the border under both a Democratic (Clinton) and a Republican (Bush) and was deported under both presidents. He returned again when a Republican (Bush) was president. Then he remained in the country through Obama\u2019s term \u2014 but it was a Republican local official who dropped the pending case.\n\nPinning the blame on any political party for Bracamontes\u2019s killing spree is a fool\u2019s game. No one let him in, and no one let him stay; he kept sneaking back in and escaped notice until he murdered the police officers.\n\nThe president earns Four Pinocchios.\n\nFour Pinocchios\n\n(About our rating scale)\n\nSend us facts to check by filling out this form\n\nSign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter\n\nThe Fact Checker is a verified signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network code of principles", "WARSAW, Poland \u2014 An exit poll suggested Poland\u2019s populist ruling party lost mayoral runoff elections Sunday in key cities including Krakow and Gdansk, though it wasn\u2019t immediately clear how hundreds of other local races were leaning.\n\nPoland\u2019s local elections have received more international attention this year amid the rise of populist governments in other parts of Europe and around the world.\n\nPoland\u2019s ruling Law and Justice party has taken a hard stance against migration, like U.S. President Donald Trump, Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary and the coalition government leading Italy. Law and Justice also has clashed with the European Union over moves to assert more control over the courts.\n\nResults from the first round of voting two weeks ago and projections from Sunday\u2019s runoffs indicated the party\u2019s populist approach to governance was rejected by voters in Poland\u2019s larger cities, which have seen mass anti-government protests in the three years since Law and Justice came to power. At the same time, the ruling party has been solidifying its support in rural areas.\n\nRunoff elections for the mayor\u2019s office in 649 cities, towns and municipalities took place between the top two vote-getters from the first round of voting conducted two weeks ago.\n\nDuring the Oct. 21 first round voting, Law and Justice strengthened its position in regional assemblies but lost mayoral races outright in Warsaw, Poznan and Lodz to a centrist pro-European Union coalition led by the Civic Platform party.\n\nWith Sunday\u2019s runoffs, the opposition took at least three more of Poland\u2019s most biggest cities.\n\nIn the Baltic port city of Gdansk, incumbent Pawel Adamowicz with Civic Platform won re-election to a sixth term. The Ipsos polling agency projected support for Adamowicz at nearly 65 percent and support for the Law and Justice candidate, Kacper Plazynski, at just over 35 percent.\n\nIn Krakow, another long-serving mayor, Jacek Majchrowski, held off a challenge from Law and Justice challenger Malgorzata Wassermann. Majchrowski was also projected to win nearly 65 percent of the vote.\n\nIpsos\u2019 projections had the mayor\u2019s job in the city of Kielce going to another opposition candidate: Bogdan Wenta, one of the best athletes in the history of Polish handball and a former coach of the national team.\n\nThe results have highlighted deep political differences between residents of Poland\u2019s cities, which have been liberal centers of opposition to the Law and Justice-led government, and of the country\u2019s rural heartland, which remains largely supportive of the party despite its conflicts with the EU.\n\nOfficial returns were not expected until Monday at the earliest.\n\nThe local elections kicked off a string of votes that will be crucial for Poland\u2019s course, including the May election choosing European Parliament representatives, the national parliament vote in fall 2019 and a presidential election in the spring of 2020.\n\nLaw and Justice won 34 percent of the total regional assembly votes two weeks ago, and the opposition coalition nearly 28 percent. One of the primary jobs of the assemblies is choosing how to spend EU subsidies.\n\nIf the ruling party maintains the level of support it received two weeks ago, it would appear to be well-poised to remain in power after the 2019 national elections, but without the parliamentary supermajority it is seeking to pursue constitutional amendments.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

But in Germany, there are no national commemorations planned for the centenary of the Nov. 11 armistice that brought an end to the bloody conflict that killed more than 2 million of its troops and left 4 million wounded. That\u2019s because the armistice did not bring peace to Germany. (Michael Probst/Associated Press)\n\nBERLIN \u2014 German Chancellor Angela Merkel will mark the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I on French soil, and German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier will be in London for a ceremony in Westminster Abbey with Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nBut while Germany\u2019s leaders visit the capitals of its wartime enemies, at home there are no national commemorations planned for the centenary of the Nov. 11 armistice that ended the four-year war that left 17 million dead, including more than 2 million German troops.\n\nNext week, the German parliament is holding a combined commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the declaration of the first German republic, the 80th anniversary of the brutal Nazi-era pogrom against Jews known as Kristallnacht (Night of Broken Glass), and the 29th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall. Almost as an afterthought, parliament notes there\u2019s also art exhibition in the lobby called \u201c1914/1918 - Not Then, Not Now, Not Ever.\u201d\n\nMore than just being on the losing side of World War I, it\u2019s what came next that is really behind Germany\u2019s lack of commemorative events.\n\nFor Germany, the Nov. 11 armistice did not mean peace like it did in France and Britain. The war\u2019s end gave rise to revolution and street fighting between far-left and far-right factions. It also brought an end to the monarchy, years of hyperinflation, widespread poverty and hunger, and helped create the conditions that brought the Nazis to power in 1933.\n\nThe horrific legacy of the Holocaust and the mass destruction of World War II simply overshadows everything else in Germany, said Daniel Schoenpflug, a historian at Berlin\u2019s Free University\u2019s Friedrich-Meinecke-Institute. His new book, \u201cA World on Edge,\u201d explores the immediate aftermath of the war through individual perspectives.\n\n\u201cOne can\u2019t reduce it to the simple fact that one country won the war and the other lost,\u201d Schoenpflug said. \u201cGermany is a country that draws practically its entire national narrative out of the defeat of 1945\u201d \u2014 and not the defeat of 1918.\n\nBy contrast in Turkey, which was also on the losing side in World War I, the war\u2019s end produced a similar collapse of the Ottoman empire and a war of independence, but also gave rise to Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, who founded the modern Turkish republic.\n\nIn Germany, even though the end of World War I is now viewed through the prism of Hitler and the Holocaust, in the immediate postwar period there actually was a time of utopianism, with movements promoting idealistic visions of peace and democracy, Schoenpflug said.\n\nYet on the other side of the political spectrum, utopianism on the right also gave birth to fascism, he said.\n\nAnd as initial euphoria over the end of World War I faded, hopes for the future quickly gave way to feelings of resentment at the reparations and conditions imposed on Germany by the victorious powers. The Nazis and right-wing nationalists were able to garner support by pushing the \u201cstab-in-the-back\u201d myth, which held that Germany\u2019s civilian leaders sold out the army by agreeing to the Nov. 11 surrender.\n\n\u201cThere was a war of dreams, a clash of utopias\u201d between the right and the left, Schoenpflug said.\n\nAlthough there aren\u2019t any national commemorations in Germany marking the war\u2019s end, individual events are planned, including an exhibition at the German Historical Museum in Berlin. A special World War I religious service is also being organized by the German Bishops Conference at the Berliner Dom cathedral.\n\nAnd in addition to German officials taking part in events in London and Paris, the Foreign Ministry said they and their British counterparts have worked together to coordinate the ringing of church and secular bells around the world on Nov. 11 to mark the war\u2019s centenary.\n\n\u201cThe bells will ring at midday to commemorate the more than 17 million victims of World War I and as a call for understanding and reconciliation across borders,\u201d the ministry said.\n\n___\n\nThis version corrects the spelling of Westminster Abbey.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Thousands of Iranians rallied in Tehran on Sunday to mark the anniversary as Washington restored all sanctions lifted under the nuclear deal. (Vahid Salemi/Associated Press)\n\nTEHRAN, Iran \u2014 Thousands of Iranians rallied Sunday in commemoration of the 39th anniversary of the takeover and hostage crisis at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, just hours before the re-imposition of all American sanctions lifted by the nuclear deal.\n\nThe 444-day crisis after the fall of the U.S.-allied shah transfixed America, as nightly images of blindfolded hostages played on television sets across the nation. Ultimately, it would be President Jimmy Carter leaving office that saw all 52 captive American diplomats freed.\n\nSunday, hard-liners vented their rage at a new American president, Donald Trump, who pulled America out of the nuclear deal struck by his predecessor that the United Nations says Tehran still honors. With crippling sanctions on Iran\u2019s vital oil industry set to take effect Monday, Iran\u2019s already-anemic economy likely will suffer more, though politicians and protesters struck a defiant tone.\n\n\u201cToday the Iranian nation will show that Mr. Trump is too small to be able to bring Iran to its knees,\u201d said Ali Larijani, Iran\u2019s parliament speaker.\n\nThe annual commemoration marks when student demonstrators climbed over the fence at the embassy on Nov. 4, 1979, angered about Carter allowing the fatally ill Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi to receive cancer treatment in the United States. The students soon took over the entire, leafy compound. A few staffers fled and hid in the home of the Canadian ambassador to Iran before escaping the country with the help of the CIA, a story recounted in the 2012 film \u201cArgo.\u201d\n\nWhile the commemoration annually sees American flags burned and cries of \u201cDeath to America\u201d rise up, it also has a carnival-like atmosphere for the students and others taking part. Some waved massive inflatable ballistic missiles. Others held signs lampooning Trump, including images of him contorted into a Nazi swastika or as a missile chasing after a dove. Some even showed a smiling silhouette logo of Kentucky Fried Chicken\u2019s founder Col. Harland David Sanders crossed-out, equating the chain once in Iran before the Islamic Revolution to decadent Americanism.\n\nGen. Mohammad Ali Jafari, the commander-in-chief of Iran\u2019s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, gave a speech vowing that Iran \u201ccan overcome this economic war and failure of the sanctions project is imminent.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Trump! Never threaten Iran because moans of the frightened U.S. forces in Tabas can still be heard,\u201d Jafari said, referring to the failed American mission to rescue the hostages known as Operation Eagle Claw.\n\nHe added: \u201cStill the moans of your terrified sailors and your British friends in Persian Gulf can be heard,\u201d referring to times the Guard have held sailors captive there.\n\nOn Friday, the Trump administration announced the restoration of sanctions on Iran\u2019s shipping, financial and energy sectors, the second batch of penalties to be restored.\n\nIran is already in the grip of an economic crisis. Its rial currency now trades at 145,000 to one U.S. dollar, down from when it traded 40,500 to $1 a year ago. The economic chaos sparked mass anti-government protests at the end of last year which resulted in nearly 5,000 reported arrests and at least 25 people being killed. Sporadic demonstrations still continue.\n\nThe United States says the sanctions are not aimed at toppling the government, but at persuading it to radically change its policies, including its support for regional militant groups and its development of long-range ballistic missiles. However, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and John Bolton, the president\u2019s national security adviser, both have made public statements supporting overthrowing Iran\u2019s theocratic government.\n\nThe symbolism of the looming sanctions coming wasn\u2019t lost on protesters Sunday.\n\n\u201cSanctions have always existed and we are used to them,\u201d said one woman protester who only gave her name as Torabi. \u201cThe tougher they take it out on us, the more resistant we become.\u201d\n\nTrump himself has embraced the sanctions as he faces a tough mid-term election in the U.S. that could change the balance of power in Congress. He tweeted out an image of him with the caption: \u201cSanctions Are Coming,\u201d a play on the HBO television series \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d Hard-liners in Iran responded with a similar image of Qassem Soleimani, the head of the Guard\u2019s expeditionary Quds Force reading: \u201cI Will Stand Against You.\u201d\n\nAnother demonstrator Sunday, Jamshid Zarei, waved a banner in English quoting Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei saying: \u201cAmerica can\u2019t do a damn thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Iranian people are feeling the economic pressure at their dinner tables and we complain about this, but it will not make Iranian people give up Islam, their values and the (Islamic) Revolution because of rising prices,\u201d he said. \u201cAnyone who thinks that way is really a fool.\u201d\n\n___\n\nGambrell reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

The show\u2019s cold open focused on many of the claims being made about the caravan of Central Americans \u2014 what The Post\u2019s Michael E. Miller called \u201ca sea of weary men, women and children, borne forward in waves by nothing more than their blistered, bleeding and bandaged feet\u201d \u2014 slowly trudging to the United States border. Many in the caravan say they plan to seek asylum.\n\nWith the midterm elections nearing, President Trump has painted those in the caravan as enemies of the United States. He\u2019s called the caravan \u201can invasion\u201d and claimed that it includes \u201cunknown Middle Easterners,\u201d criminals and \u201cvery tough fighters.\u201d He has said that he may send up to 15,000 U.S. troops to the Mexico border.\n\nFox News has added its own strong rhetoric about the caravan to this simmering pot of unease.\n\nSNL\u2019s cold opens tend to revolve around the week\u2019s news and often offers nearly play-by-play re-creations of things Trump has said or done. This week, with no guest actors, it chose a different route and placed Fox News in its crosshairs.\n\nThe show imagined an episode of conservative commentator Laura Ingraham\u2019s show \u201cThe Ingraham Angle.\u201d Kate McKinnon takes on the role of Ingraham and discusses the caravan with various guests, including fellow Fox host Jeanine Pirro (Cecily Strong) and former Wisconsin sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. (Kenan Thompson).\n\nThroughout the sketch, the three offer up absurd \u201cfacts\u201d about the caravan in a satire that felt almost like reality. For example, SNL\u2019s Ingraham describes the caravan as \u201cvicious.\u201d It is made up \u201cof dozens, maybe millions of illegal immigrants . . . headed straight for you and your grandchildren,\u201d she adds. \u201cAnd that is not fear-mongering. That is just the truth.\u201d\n\nAs the talking heads discuss the caravan, they keep cutting to what they claim is live footage of it \u2014 but is really just news footage of a store being overrun by people, crabs walking to the ocean, and a clip from the Brad Pitt zombie movie \u201cWorld War Z.\u201d\n\nSNL\u2019s Pirro appears first, saying the caravan is composed of \u201ceveryone you\u2019ve ever seen in your nightmares, Laura. It\u2019s got Guatemalans, Mexicans, ISIS, the Menendez brothers, the 1990 Detroit Pistons, Thanos and several babadooks.\u201d\n\nShe then backs Trump\u2019s (actual) claim that the caravan includes Middle Easterners, though she uses a different phrase for them: \u201cThis caravan\u2019s got hella Aladdins.

And it came to a rapid conclusion.\n\nTwo-division champion Daniel Cormier made quick, easy work of Derrick Lewis in the main event of UFC 230 to retain his heavyweight title at Madison Square Garden on Saturday night.\n\nCormier was thoroughly dominant, taking the fight to the ground early in both the first and second rounds. Lewis, a prohibitive underdog, needed to stay on his feet to have any hope of landing a big, knockout blow \u2014 such as the one which finished off Alexander Volkov in the waning seconds of their UFC 229 bout.\n\nBut he never had the chance. Cormier just would not let Lewis up off the deck. A rear naked choke finished the job at 2:14 of the second round \u2014 with Lewis submitting for the first time as a professional.\n\nIt was a somewhat disappointing outcome to a fight which was slapped together at the last-minute, with the UFC 230 card badly in need of a headline attraction. Cormier, one of the best to ever grace the octagon, entered with a decided advantage in every category save one \u2014 power. And that provided the intrigue for this match: Could Lewis land his one big shot?\n\nCormier quickly put that question to rest\n\n\u201cIf you have a puncher\u2019s chance ... that\u2019s not enough,\u201d Cormier said. \u201cYou have to be one of the best in the world to even compete [with me]. And Derrick is good, but just not that level yet.\u201d\n\nNow, the 39-year-old Cormier \u2014 who has insisted he will retire once he turns 40 \u2014 appears to be headed for a big-money showdown with Brock Lesnar \u2014 a fight he\u2019s had his sights set on for some time.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d Cormier said when asked by Joe Rogan about the prospect of facing Lesnar. \u201cLet\u2019s go, Brock!\u201d\n\nIf Cormier holds to his word, that showdown figures to be his UFC swan song. The sport would not be the same without him.\n\nUFC 230: Daniel Cormier vs.Derrick Lewis\n\nDaniel Cormier (22-1) def. Derrick Lewis (22-6) by submission (Rear naked choke at 2:14 of round two).\n\nRound 2: Lewis takes a home run swing about 30 seconds into the round and misses. It\u2019s a frightening reminder for Cormier that it just takes one shot from Lewis to end it. But he can\u2019t land that shot from the ground. And that\u2019s exactly where he is once again, as Cormier gets his third takedown. He\u2019s got side control, and now he\u2019s got Lewis\u2019s back. The challenger is in a dangerous spot here. And there it is! Cormier applies the rear naked choke. And that will do it. Lewis taps out. Dominant victory by submission for the UFC legend Cormier.\n\nRound 1: Underway at Madison Square Garden. Three kicks to start the match for Lewis, perhaps somewhat surprisingly. That would seem to open him up to a Cormier takedown. And there it is. With not even a minute gone by, Cormier has this fight on the ground, right where he wants it. Lewis can\u2019t land one of his punishing right hands from down there. Cormier has top position, and is controlling the action. Lewis manages to get up, but Cormier gets him right back down. Cormier has Lewis\u2019s back \u2014 and he lands some strong ground strikes. All Cormier in the opening round. He was dominant, and fell just a fraction short of a 10-8 round. 10-9 Cormier.\n\nDATA\n\nWhere: Madison Square Garden, New York\n\nTV: FS1 (prelims), PPV (main card) | Stream: UFC.TV\n\nWith UFC 230 badly in need of a headline bout, Dana White\u2019s choice was easy \u2014 bring back Derrick Lewis for a showdown with UFC great Daniel Cormier. There was some question, though, as to whether Lewis would be willing.\n\nThe subject came up in the octagon immediately after his previous fight, on Oct. 6, at UFC 229, and Lewis (21-5) seemed cool to the prospect, on account of his less-than-stellar physical conditioning.\n\nBut it\u2019s happening. On Saturday night at Madison Square Garden, after Lewis reversed his position and agreed to take the fight against Cormier with less than one month of turnaround time. What changed?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the money,\u201d Lewis told The Washington Post. \u201cThat makes it worth jumping back in there. Ain\u2019t no telling when I\u2019m going to get another opportunity like this.\u201d\n\n[Derrick Lewis, already an Internet sensation, returns to the octagon in UFC 230]\n\nMain card (10 p.m., PPV)\n\nDaniel Cormier vs. Derrick Lewis\n\nJacare Souza (26-6) def. Chris Weidman (14-4) by technical knockout (2:46 of round three)\n\nThis was an outstanding fight to cap off the quartet of middleweight contests leading up to Cormier vs. Lewis. Both men showed why they were ranked in the top five coming into the night. This one was contested at a high level. Souza stepped up the tempo early in the second round, and his aggression paid off. He was relentless, fighting through a bloody nose to land big shots. Surprisingly, given both men\u2019s proficiency on the ground, most of this fight was spent standing up.\n\nThe fight ended controversially \u2014 with Souza landing a crushing right hand to Weidman\u2019s temple, which dropped him instantly. Souza, the No. 5-ranked middleweight, knew he had landed the finishing blow and he pleaded with referee Dan Miragliotta to stop the fight. But Miragliotta let the action continue and Souza got a couple of more shots in on a thoroughly defeated Weidman. It was a poor stoppage. Weidman didn\u2019t have to take those last few punches.\n\nNonetheless, a big win for Souza \u2014 who stamped himself as a major player at 185.\n\nJared Cannonier (11-4) def. David Branch (22-5) by technical knockout (0:39 of round two)\n\nMild upset here, as Cannonier takes out the favored Branch with a terrific second-round flurry. Branch\u2019s intent was clear from the get-go: He wanted the fight on the ground. But Cannonier was able to get to his feet and stay out of trouble. Then, an overhand right square on Branch\u2019s chin knocked him down and set up the barrage that followed. Cannonier finished off his victory a series of hammer fists and elbows \u2014 enough of which landed to force the stoppage. Cannonier, like Karl Roberson, figures to land in the top 10 when the new middleweight rankings are released.\n\nKarl Roberson (7-1) vs. Jack Marshman (22-8) by unanimous decision\n\nMarshman showed incredible toughness and a great chin. But that was about all. Roberson dominated this one from beginning to end. The left hand counter shot was money in the bank for Roberson \u2014 who thwarted the rare Marshman attacks with it. Roberson overcame a right knee injury to coast through the last round. He got the fight to the ground about halfway through the third, and that\u2019s where it stayed. Certainly not as head-turning of a performance as Israel Adesanya in the preceding match, but Marshman might well crack the middleweight top 10 after this.\n\nIsrael Adesanya (15-0) def. Derek Brunson (18-7) by technical knockout (4:51 of round one)\n\nExciting opener to the main card as Adesanya kept his perfect record intact with a superb flurry late in the first round to defeat Brunson. Adesanya, the No. 9-ranked middleweight, landed a knee square to Brunson\u2019s jaw with fewer than 40 seconds to go in the round, and Brunson never recovered. Adesanya showed terrific finishing instinct to close out the contest, landing several more knees and a series of punches. A right-left combination finished the job for Adesanya, who handled his step up in competition well. He seems primed for big things at middleweight.\n\nRead More:\n\nUFC 230 gets spicy: Derrick Lewis says Daniel Cormier \u2018disrespected\u2019 Popeyes chicken\n\nNevada extends Conor McGregor, Khabib Nurmagomedov suspensions as investigation continues\n\n\u2018Go open a liquor store\u2019: Conor McGregor blasted by Khabib Nurmagomedov\u2019s manager\n\nConor McGregor tells Jerry Jones he wants a UFC fight at AT&T Stadium", "A man, right, drapes the flag of New Caledonia on his shoulders as the French flag flies in the background as he and a woman line up to cast their votes at a polling station in Noumea, New Caledonia, as part of an independence referendum, Sunday, Nov. 4, 2018. Voters in New Caledonia are deciding whether the French territory in the South Pacific should break free from the European country that claimed it in the mid-19th century. (Mathurin Derel/Associated Press)\n\nNOUMEA, New Caledonia \u2014 A majority of voters in the South Pacific territory of New Caledonia chose to remain part of France instead of backing independence Sunday, a watershed moment that led French President Emmanuel Macron to promise a full dialogue on the archipelago\u2019s future.\n\nFinal results had 56.4 percent of the voters who participated in the referendum deciding to maintain ties with the country that has ruled New Caledonia since the mid-19th century and 43.6 percent supporting independence, the high commissioner\u2019s office said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m asking everyone to turn toward the future to build tomorrow\u2019s New Caledonia,\u201d Macron said, speaking from the presidential Elysee Palace in Paris. \u201cThe spirit of dialogue is the sole winner.\u201d\n\nMore than 174,000 registered voters were invited to answer the question: \u201cDo you want New Caledonia to gain full sovereignty and become independent?\u201d\n\nThe referendum attracted record-high turnout of 80.6 percent \u2014 so many voters that some polling stations in the capital, Noumea, had to stay open about an hour longer than planned to handle the crush.\n\nThe vote itself was a milestone in New Caledonia\u2019s three decades of decolonization, a process prompted by the ill treatment Europeans inflicted on the region\u2019s indigenous Kanak people. New Caledonia, an archipelago east of Australia, has a nickel mining industry as well as sun-kissed lagoons.\n\nThe high commissioner\u2019s office reported limited outbreaks of unrest in Noumea as votes were counted, with seven cars set ablaze, some roads closed and two instances of stone-throwing. But otherwise the vote was overwhelmingly peaceful.\n\nPraising both sides for their \u201cresponsible\u201d campaigns, Macron said \u201ccontempt and violence\u201d were the only losers in the historic poll.\n\nFrench Prime Minister Edouard Philippe is set to meet with New Caledonian officials Monday to discuss the political future of the territory of 270,000 people.\n\nNew Caledonia receives about 1.3 billion euros ($1.5 billion) in French state subsidies every year, and many had feared the economy would suffer if ties were severed.\n\nResidents of the region include the native Kanaks, who represent about 40 percent of the population, people of European descent, which make up about 27 percent and others from Asian countries and Pacific islands.\n\nVoter Monette Saihulinwa said she opposed independence.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t necessarily want our lives to change,\u201d the 50-year-old said.\n\nOthers hailed the ballot as historic.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting for 30 years for this vote,\u201d said Mariola Bouyer, 34. \u201cThis vote must demonstrate that we want to live in peace, no matter our race, our roots. It\u2019s building a country together.\u201d\n\nThe referendum was the result of a process that started 30 years ago to end years of violence between independence supporters and opponents that had overall claimed more than 70 lives. The two sides agreed upon a 1988 deal and another agreement a decade later included plans for an independence referendum.\n\nThe New Caledonia archipelago became French in 1853 under Emperor Napoleon III \u2014 Napoleon\u2019s nephew and heir \u2014 and was used for decades as a prison colony.\n\nIt became an overseas territory after World War II, with French citizenship granted to all Kanaks in 1957. Under French colonial rule, the Kanaks faced strict segregation policies and suffered discrimination.\n\n___\n\nAP writers Thomas Adamson and John Leicester contributed from Paris.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

On Saturday night here in Death Valley, there came a traveling exhibition of art so profound that it did an almighty job of instilling quiet. Methodically, sometimes spectacularly, it steadily quieted a booming sound that had come cascading out of the American Southeast at the opening kickoff and had made even the shyest neck hairs stand and salute.\n\nIt was a rarefied exhibit of the art of American football, college division, with 102,321 patrons in Tiger Stadium glimpsing Alabama, whose 29-0 win made a team ranked all the way up at No. 3, LSU, look as if No. 3 were a ranking tens of notches beneath No. 1. It also reinforced that watching Alabama football in the year 2018 has become an exercise not for thrill-seekers \u2014 for there is no suspense \u2014 but for football connoisseurs.\n\n[Postcards from College Football America: Five days, four campuses, three games and a memorial]\n\n\u201cWe really wanted to make a statement in this game,\u201d said the conductor, Alabama Coach Nick Saban, as \u201ca lot of people talked about our (weak) schedule,\u201d all going to show how artists can get so huffy about slights.\n\nAs the total-yardage tally climbed from 149-38 to 325-67 at halftime to 471-108 after three quarters to 576-196 at the end, a perfectly excellent team from LSU (7-2) came to look as if traveling by stagecoach. \u201cOur offensive line was getting beaten one-on-one,\u201d LSU Coach Ed Orgeron said. \u201cWe had max protection. Those guys were beating us. They stunned us. We tried everything we possibly could \u2014 go full wide, max protection. We just got beat.\u201d\n\nThe people saw the smorgasbord that makes Alabama (9-0) complete except for its nutty extra-point crew. They saw the art of quarterbacking perfected as seldom before by Tua Tagovailoa, the Hawaiian with the Heisman Trophy apparently up ahead. They saw a defensive lineman, Quinnen Williams, master the valued knack of quarterback harassment with 2 \u00bd sacks and 3 \u00bd tackles for losses.\n\n[College football Week 10 winners and losers]\n\nThey saw Tagovailoa\u2019s 25-yard touchdown pass to tight end Irv Smith Jr. late in the second quarter to make the score 16-0, a throw so bloody gorgeous it deserved violin accompaniment. They saw Tagovailoa\u2019s 44-yard touchdown scramble in the third quarter to make the score 22-0, a run so breathtaking even if he did say, \u201cI think when I hit the 30, my leg gave out, and I was just going off momentum. I was just trying to gallop into the end zone. And I made it, so . . .\u201d\n\nThey saw little things, from Tagovailoa\u2019s unusually deft knack for finding clever angles of escape from rushers, to the way Christian Miller, a sam linebacker, can throw aside a blocker en route to causing havoc. Emblematic of Alabama\u2019s burgeoning receiving corps, Henry Ruggs III made a an absurd 14-yard catch by stretching his right hand behind him to snare it, and Jaylen Waddle made an expert 28-yard catch on a third-and-15 when he stopped and balanced himself along the sideline.\n\nThe footwork of Damien Harris, who rushed for 107 yards on 19 carries, seemed, when combined with all else, unfair.\n\nSee all that, and one does go quiet.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re a team that they do the little things well,\u201d LSU defensive lineman Breiden Fehoko said. \u201cYou hop out of your gap, they\u2019re gonna gash you. You misread your coverage, they\u2019re gonna throw a big one on you.\u201d Of Alabama\u2019s offensive line, he said, \u201cWhen they move, they move as a unit.\u201d\n\n[Svrluga: It\u2019s a mess, and it\u2019s so damn hard, but Maryland football plays on]\n\nOn a soaring Louisiana football weekend which boasts the Nos. 1 and 3 college teams and arguably the Nos. 1 and 3 NFL teams, the Los Angeles Rams (8-0) playing at the New Orleans Saints (6-1) on Sunday, the stadium and the scenes around it did constitute a heap of a fuss. The traditional \u201cTiger Walk\u201d through the throngs of fans felt unusually electric, with Orgeron leading the way and looking almost electrified.\n\nThen the game began, and people wondered how Tagovailoa, the first-year starter, might cope with his first dive into such outlandish noise. He coped. Capably he marched Alabama down the field to the LSU 14-yard line until the drive fizzled in a mess of false starts plus some LSU antagonists busting in and taking a loud hit at Tagovailoa, who went down for a spell.\n\n\u201cOh, he hit me in the goodies,\u201d said the 20-year-old quarterback. \u201cWhew! That hurt. That hurt for a good minute. I couldn\u2019t breathe for a second.\u201d He recovered, of course, in a \u201cvery, very hostile environment,\u201d but \u201ca good opportunity for our team,\u201d as he put it.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s one of the best players I\u2019ve seen,\u201d said Orgeron, who has seen some.\n\nEven when LSU fans, irked at the first-half suspension of top defender Devin White over a debated targeting call from LSU\u2019s previous game, got themselves a big cheer at the reversal of a targeting call on LSU safety Grant Delpit, which happened on an Alabama touchdown, Tagovailoa\u2019s 15-yard pass to Ruggs that opened the scoring.\n\nEven when Tagovailoa finally committed his first interception of the season on his 179th attempt, late in the second quarter, it somehow helped Alabama. A bomb, it pinned LSU at its own 4-yard line, an inconvenience it clearly did not need.\n\nEven in the ancient area of rushing the football, often forgotten in this era, Orgeron wound up summarizing, \u201cTwo hundred eighty-one yards rushing for Alabama, 12 yards rushing for us.\u201d\n\nThe show carried such a rarefied excellence that when the good LSU kicker Cole Tracy missed a 33-yard field goal attempt barely wide left with 10:45 remaining, he forged an act of inadvertent accuracy. Budging LSU\u2019s score off its telltale zero would have seemed inappropriate, for the zero was perfect, undeserving of muddle.\n\nThat\u2019s even if Alabama wasn\u2019t perfect, especially on extra points, two of which it missed Saturday night to ring up six such foibles for the season. When it did make one after its closing touchdown with 5:42 left in the game, its corner of supporters supplied a mocking cheer.\n\nThey are, after all, connoisseurs.", "Central American migrants, part of the caravan hoping to reach the U.S. border, travel on a truck in Loma Bonita, Oaxaca state, Mexico, Saturday, Nov. 3, 2018.

She was also a faculty member at Florida State and a mother.\n\nMaura Binkley, who grew up in Atlanta and was a double major in English and German, was set to graduate in May.\n\nBeierle was described as a brooding military veteran and former teacher, who appeared to have made videos detailing his hatred of everything from the Affordable Care Act to girls who\u2019d allegedly mistreated him in middle school. The videos were posted four years ago, and were removed from YouTube after the shooting.\n\nNumerous disturbing details about him have emerged. He\u2019d once been banned from FSU\u2019s campus and had been arrested twice for grabbing women even though charges were ultimately dropped.\n\nBeierle, who had moved to the central Florida town of Deltona after getting a graduate degree from FSU, appeared to post a series of videos on YouTube in 2014 where he called women \u201cwhores\u201d if they dated black men, said many black women were \u201cdisgusting\u201d and described himself as a misogynist.\n\nA Tallahassee police spokesman would not confirm or deny the videos were Beierle\u2019s. However, the man speaking in the videos looks like Beierle and biographical details mentioned in the videos match known facts about Beierle, including details of his military service. The poster\u2019s YouTube username included the word \u201cScott,\u201d Beierle\u2019s first name. The existence of the videos was first reported by BuzzFeed.\n\nA woman who filed a police report against Beierle told The AP she\u2019s never forgotten how \u201ccreepy\u201d he was.\n\nCourtnee Connon was 18 in 2012 when, she said, Scott Paul Beierle grabbed her buttocks at a Florida State dining hall.

However, since the 2012 battery charges were dropped, Meggs said, it would have been routine for Beierle to receive a deferred prosecution deal.\n\n\u201cIt would not have been atypical as a first-time offender for him to get diversion,\u201d said Meggs, since retired as state attorney for Florida\u2019s Second Judicial Circuit. \u201cWe should have called the victim to make sure she was OK with him getting diversion.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not clear from the court file whether that occurred, and the woman didn\u2019t respond to emails seeking comment.

Instead, I spent seven days a week at church: It was where I worshiped, socialized, ate, volunteered and even went to school. One summer, at the fellowship\u2019s \u201cSchool of Prophets\u201d camp in rural Iowa, a senior pastor took his turn at the pulpit to encourage the youth of the congregation to skip college, work for the church and live in one of its communal homes in Hawaii or Brazil, which many in my graduating class went on to do. My parents, who joined the cult as graduate students in the 1970s but have recently left, were an educated anomaly in a culture that valued faith over reason. I\u2019m grateful for my father, who in passing later that day told the pastor in seriousness disguised as joviality, \u201cStay away from my kids.\u201d\n\nI \u201cblew out\u201d of the cult \u2014 to use its own lingo for leaving \u2014 after my senior year to attend a Catholic university 20 miles away. I still read the Apostle Paul, but Jane Austen and James Joyce, too. Then I earned a PhD in English at the University of Minnesota, where I rehearsed Marx\u2019s and Freud\u2019s critiques of religion. Simmering with smug resentment, I was certain that I, an intellectual, was on the right side of history, a sworn opponent of the oppressive ideologies I ascribed to organized religion.\n\nBut I had to climb only so far up the ivory tower to recognize patterns of abuse that I thought \u2014 in my new, secular life \u2014 I had left behind. Because academia, I slowly realized, is also a cult.\n\nCults are systems of social control. They are insular but often evangelical organizations whose aims (be they money, power, sex or something else) are rooted in submission to a dogma manifested by an authority figure: a charismatic preacher or, say, a tenured professor. The relationship between shepherd and sheep is couched in unwavering commitment to a supposedly noble, transcendent cause. For the Living Word Fellowship, that meant \u201cthe Lordship of Jesus Christ\u201d; for academia, \u201cthe production of knowledge.\u201d In both cases, though, faith ultimately amounts to mastering the rules of the leaders, whose infallibility \u2014 whether by divine right or endowed chair \u2014 excuses all else.\n\nLooking back, the evidence was everywhere: I\u2019d seen needless tears in the eyes of classmates, harangued in office hours for having the gall to request a letter of recommendation from an adviser. Others\u2019 lives were put on hold for months or sometimes years by dissertation committee members\u2019 refusal to schedule an exam or respond to an email. I met the wives and girlfriends of senior faculty members, often former and sometimes current advisees, and heard rumors of famed scholars whisked abroad to sister institutions in the wake of grad student affairs gone awry. I\u2019d first come in contact with such unchecked power dynamics as a child, in the context of church. In adulthood, as both a student and an employee of a university, I found myself subject to them once again.\n\n[The cult of the PhD]\n\nOne department chair, who had trained as a community organizer in the 1960s, threatened to use the Freedom of Information Act to read graduate students\u2019 emails; she could have, too, since we were technically employees of the state. Elsewhere, a senior colleague propositioned my friend for a sex act I cannot name in this newspaper before the first semester at her new job had even begun; after she complained to her boss, she was removed from her position under other pretenses. I\u2019ve seen grad students expected to put $16 whiskeys for their advisers on nearly maxed-out credit cards at the hotel bar of an academic conference. It\u2019s not unusual for academic job seekers to spend 10 percent of their annual income \u2014 the amount of a tithe \u2014 attending a single conference for an interview (including airfare, lodging, registration fees and incidentals). A peer of mine was even directed by her adviser to write a doctoral dissertation renouncing the subject of her master\u2019s thesis, a philosopher whose views do not align with the adviser\u2019s own. It should come as no surprise that the professor who made that demand is a white male alumnus of the Ivy League, and the student an immigrant from a working-class background.\n\nWe endure these indignities in pursuit of positions that are scarce to nonexistent. Last November, Inside Higher Ed reported that the number of jobs advertised by the Modern Language Association in 2016-2017 had declined for the fifth year in a row, hitting a new low. The MLA\u2019s 2018-2019 Job Information List , released in early October, currently lists fewer than 50 jobs in my field, American literature. Though the list will continue to be updated throughout the year, and not all positions are included on it, the final tally will come nowhere near the number of newly minted PhDs: Despite the dearth of jobs, humanities programs awarded 5,891 doctoral degrees in 2015, the year I defended my dissertation, which is the most since such data began to be recorded in 1987. Nearly three times the number of faculty positions in English and foreign languages advertised that academic year.\n\nThat asymmetry contributes to a culture of dependency, convincing graduate students that they must obey the dictates of their advisers if they hope to obtain increasingly scarce jobs. It is also, at least in part, a response to the desires of tenured faculty members, hungry for disciples of their own, regardless of whether there are jobs for them. Inevitably, it results in a growing pool of academics who teach on an adjunct basis, frequently making less than minimum wage, without benefits, subsisting in patterns of unfair employment not unlike those of the church employees I knew growing up: financially insecure and thus susceptible to offers they can\u2019t refuse. With little practical training even in teaching, the implied career goal of many research fields, grad students who venture out of their discipline may appear overqualified to employers wary of the initials following their names, but they are usually underqualified, their concrete experience limited to the service jobs and freelance gigs keeping them afloat between terms. Those faithful who adjunct, whether by necessity or choice, commonly earn less than $5,000 per class, and in 2015 the University of California at Berkeley Labor Center reported that a quarter of part-time faculty members are on public assistance, further foreclosing their options and avenues of escape.\n\n[Even progressive academics can be racist. I\u2019ve experienced it firsthand.]\n\nExploitative labor practices occupy the ground floor of every religious movement, and adjuncts, like cult members, are usually required to work long and hard for little remuneration, toiling in support of the institution to prove their devotion to academia itself. Contrary to stereotypes of professors as contemplative eggheads at best and partisan layabouts at worst, many academics use their summers and sabbaticals as opportunities to catch up on articles and book projects held over from previous academic years, overworking as many as 60 hours per week. The cliche \u201cpublish or perish\u201d belies a constant demand to prove one\u2019s commitment and worth, amounting to a crippling fear of being \u201cintellectually pantsed,\u201d as a mentor of mine once said. It\u2019s difficult not to see these abuses as rites of passage in the service of some higher cause. Academics may cast themselves as hardened opponents of dominant norms and constituted power, but their rituals of entitlement and fiendish loyalty to established networks of caste and privilege undermine that critical pose. No one says it aloud, but every graduate student knows: This is the price you pay for a chance to enter the sanctum of the tenure track. Follow the leader, or prepare to teach high school.\n\nLike others who\u2019ve come to this realization, I was not surprised when I learned of the recent sexual harassment investigation of Avital Ronell, a professor of German and comparative literature at New York University whom I cited heavily in my doctoral dissertation. Less shocking still was the smear campaign that many of her celebrated colleagues launched against her accuser, Nimrod Reitman, which resembles the silencing tactics deployed by the Church of Scientology and other cults. These scholars fail embarrassingly to embrace the radical theories on which their careers and reputations rest.\n\nThey are the figures who preside over the important professional organizations, teach at the best schools, use their prestige to get their grad students the best jobs (or claim to, anyway) and even author the \u201cscriptures\u201d that their disciples will go on to teach. Until he died in 1983, the Living Word\u2019s founder, John Robert Stevens, had much in common with these academic saints. His texts are densely complicated webs of metaphor, jargon and reference that demand the interpretations of other cognoscenti whose proximity to the source is not always solely spiritual or intellectual. Ronell, for her part, has been known to begin talks by invoking her own departed master: philosopher Jacques Derrida. As Andrea Long Chu notes, describing her apprenticeship to Ronell, the professor wrote that she\u2019d been \u201cconditioned for every sort of servitude, understanding that doing time, whether in graduate school or as part of a teaching body, amounted to acts \u2014 or, rather, passivities \u2014 of cultish subjection.\u201d The networks of adulation Derrida and other deconstruction evangelists engendered resemble the followings of other charismatic leaders: the Rajneesh, Sun Myung Moon, Marshall Applewhite, Jim Jones.\n\nThe Ronell scandal should alert us to the broader ways in which the 21st-century university is an absolutist institution, a promoter of sycophancy and an enemy of dissent. The fault doesn\u2019t lie with any one school of thought so much as with the academy itself.\n\nKnowing all of this, I doubt that I would have had the courage to write this essay were I still applying for faculty jobs this fall. My dance with the tenure track came to an end more or less where it began: On the campus of a small liberal arts college where I was a candidate for an assistant professorship. I got the job but ultimately turned it down. I\u2019ve learned a lot in universities, but none of it as important as what leaving the cult had taught me 15 years earlier, a lesson I\u2019d be a hypocrite to preach from the lectern: No institution has a monopoly on truth.\n\nRead more from Outlook:\n\nTrump won because college-educated Americans are out of touch\n\nWhat do the academy and the military have in common?\n\nFollow our updates on Facebook and Twitter.", "Australian Roman Catholic nun Sister Patricia Fox receives flowers from children of informal settlers as she arrives for a visit to the Redemptorist Church prior to her departure for Australia Saturday, Nov. 3, 2018 in suburban Paranaque city, south of Manila, Philippines.

The Philippine immigration bureau has ordered the deportation of Fox who has angered the president by joining anti-government rallies. (Bullit Marquez/Associated Press)\n\nMANILA, Philippines \u2014 An Australian nun who angered the Philippine president by joining anti-government protests used her final hours in the country to call on Filipinos to unite and fight human rights abuses.\n\nSister Patricia Anne Fox left the Philippines for Australia on Saturday night. The Bureau of Immigration ordered her deported in July, put her on a blacklist and then downgraded her missionary visa to a temporary visitor\u2019s visa, which expired Saturday.\n\nPresident Rodrigo Duterte has bristled at criticism of his leadership, particularly by foreigners like Fox, who he says have no right to meddle in Philippine domestic affairs. Most of the criticism has focused on his bloody anti-drug campaign, which has left thousands dead, alarmed Western governments and rights groups and prompted two complaints of mass murder before the International Criminal Court.\n\n\u201cAt present in the Philippines the human rights abuses are just increasing and it\u2019s a reign of terror and tyranny,\u201d Fox told reporters after arriving at Melbourne airport on Sunday.\n\nDuring a farewell news conference in a Catholic school before leaving for the Manila airport with a convoy of supporters, the 71-year-old Fox called on Filipinos to speak up and help the marginalized fight to gain land, houses and jobs.\n\n\u201cThe big challenge now is not to lose hope, to know that if we all move together, we can bring about change,\u201d Fox said.\n\n\u201cPope Francis said that if you\u2019re a Christian and there\u2019s massive human rights violations ... you should take action, make noise. Where the oppressed are, the church people should be there, not only always talking but with them and hopefully more vocal,\u201d she said.\n\nFox told The Associated Press separately by phone that Duterte\u2019s anti-drug crackdown was \u201chorribly barbaric\u201d and she vowed to return to the country if allowed to resume her 27 years of missionary work for the poor.\n\n\u201cI know a lot of mothers, wives who have lost someone. You have no right to take a life just like that without justice,\u201d Fox said.\n\nDozens of activists, laborers, priests, nuns and tribal people, some in tears, thanked Fox by celebrating a Mass in her honor before sending her off. A lawyers group backing Fox, the National Union of Peoples\u2019 Lawyers, said that by persecuting a frail and low-key missionary, Duterte has turned her into an \u201covernight rock star.\u201d\n\nKnown for being soft-spoken, Fox is a coordinator of a Roman Catholic order of nuns and has worked for the poor in the Philippines. She promotes human rights and the welfare of workers, farmers and ethnic groups and has spoken against Duterte and his government, which has also been criticized for stifling dissent.\n\nShe recalled in Melbourne that after she had spoken publicly in support for Coca-Cola workers seeking benefits in the Philippines, their picket was \u201cbroken up brutally, 10 of them were arrested and were five days in jail and not charged.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd so they were having a press conference and I did say to them, when they wanted me to speak, that the teachings of the Catholic Church clearly say you have a right to assembly, you have a right to unionize, you have a right to regular work. Now that, in the deportation order, was anti-government. One of the commentators said that now the social teachings of the Catholic Church are anti-government,\u201d she said.\n\nThe immigration bureau said Fox violated her missionary visa by venturing far beyond her community in suburban Quezon city in metropolitan Manila and interfered in domestic politics by joining protests and news conferences that tackled \u201cpolitical and human rights issues against the government.\u201d\n\nFox\u2019s lawyers said she joined the marginalized as part of her missionary work and called the Duterte administration\u2019s actions \u201cpolitical persecution.\u201d They expressed fears that the move to evict Fox could undermine the crucial civic and religious work of foreign missionaries in the country.\n\nAside from Fox, the government has separately blocked a critical Italian politician, Giacomo Filibeck, and another Australian, Gill Hale Boehringer, from entering the Philippines this year.\n\n\u201cThe law is clear: The entry and admission of an alien is a matter of privilege, and not a right,\u201d Bureau of Immigration spokeswoman Dana Sandoval said Saturday.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Republicans are favored to keep control of the Senate, but enough top-tier races from Florida to Nevada to Tennessee and Missouri were sufficiently close that the outcome was in doubt.

It also will demonstrate whether Trump can mobilize his army of backers \u2014 \u201cthe silent majority,\u201d as he termed it in 2016 \u2014 to vote for other Republicans when his name is not atop the ballot.\n\nThe outcome will set the tone for the bigger battle to come, the 2020 presidential race, with Trump testing his messages and what is likely to be a crowded field of Democrats scouring the landscape for clues about how to challenge the president.\n\n\n\nPresident Trump attends a rally for Republican U.S. Senate candidate Matt Rosendale at the Bozeman Yellowstone International Airport in Belgrade, Mont., on Nov. 3, 2018. (Carlos Barria/Reuters)\n\nThe anxiety, and energy, are palpable on both sides.\n\nTrump, closing the campaign with racially charged warnings about an approaching migrant \u201cinvasion,\u201d told cheering supporters in Indiana that the country will decide whether \u201cwe let the radical Democrats take control of Congress and take a giant wrecking ball to our economy and to our future.\u201d\n\nFormer president Barack Obama, who has emerged in the campaign\u2019s closing days as an aggressive campaigner for Democrats, told supporters in Miami that the \u201ccharacter of our country is on the ballot.\u201d\n\nA sense of foreboding, meanwhile, was setting in for many Democrats, who want to believe the experts who say their party has an edge in the battle for the House but recall the pain of their misplaced optimism two years ago. They are haunted by the failure in 2016 to turn out enough black, Hispanic and young voters \u2014 and can\u2019t fathom how they will feel about their country if the Trump-led GOP prevails again.\n\n\u201cIt all started in 2016. I sat there and cried that night,\u201d said Stacee Wilhite, a 41-year-old stay-at-home mom who became involved in politics this year for the first time, campaigning for a Democratic candidate north of Los Angeles. \u201cWe tell each other, \u2018We can\u2019t let up. We have to keep pushing. Just look at what happened in 2016.\u2019 We could lose by one seat. That\u2019s what makes us so nervous.\u201d\n\nThe intensity on both sides has been apparent in the surge of early voting. More than 33 million early votes have been cast, surpassing the 2014 midterm voting totals and in some places approaching presidential-level turnout, according to Michael McDonald, an associate professor at the University of Florida who tracks early voting.\n\nAdding to the tension are the simmering, raw emotions that remain after an outbreak of apparently politically motivated violence. First there was a string of mail bombs sent to Trump critics by a supporter of the president. Then came the massacre of 11 Jews in a Pittsburgh synagogue, allegedly carried out by an anti-Semitic gunman who had espoused anger at the same caravan of Central American refugees that has drawn the ire of Trump and his allies.\n\nMany Democrats have argued that Trump\u2019s response to those tragedies \u2014 further stoking fear and trying to run ads that CNN deemed too racist to carry \u2014 have helped them attract previously pro-GOP suburban voters, just as Trump built a new coalition in 2016 by usurping working-class voters who had been loyal Democrats for a generation.\n\n\u201cIt is different from two years ago in terms of unequivocal enthusiasm that [Democrats] have to vote, how open independents are to hearing an argument and how necessary it is to make sure we correct whatever vile suppression of the vote is being put out there by the Republicans,\u201d House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said in an interview.\n\nIf Republicans see large losses, losing control of one or both chambers of Congress, Trump could be forced to recalibrate and give Democrats a chance to pounce \u2014 issuing subpoenas, launching investigations and potentially starting impeachment proceedings.\n\nBut if Republicans maintain control, their victory could reaffirm Trump\u2019s vision of the country, emboldening him to pursue his immigration policies, crack down on special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigation and renew efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cHanding the Democrats the keys to our government in 4 days would be no different from handing matches to an arsonist,\u201d read a fundraising email from the Republican National Committee on Friday. \u201cThey would have full power to launch any investigation they want against anyone they want, and without any corroborating evidence.\u201d\n\nTrump, who has thrown himself into the campaign fray with an intensity unusual for presidents in midterms, is trying to do what then-President Obama failed to achieve in the 2010 and 2014 elections: Motivate the legions of supporters who cast ballots for him for president to vote in midterm elections for other Democrats.\n\n\u201cNobody thought of the midterms as being that big a deal for years \u2014 for years,\u201d Trump said at a Thursday night rally in Columbia, Mo. \u201cYou know, you hear \u2018midterms,\u2019 it\u2019s like let\u2019s go to sleep, right? This year, we\u2019re breaking every single record in attendance for the midterms.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d rallies are ostensibly orchestrated to help lift local Republican candidates for the U.S. Senate, House and governorships, but Trump has been focusing mostly on himself \u2014 and has sounded more like a candidate for reelection than a surrogate for others. He speaks for an hour or more at each stop about what he describes as record-breaking accomplishments and what he terms \u201cthe greatest political movement in American history.\u201d\n\nAt a rally in the past week in Estero, Fla., Trump singled out two area congressmen up for reelection, Reps. Francis Rooney and Matt Gaetz. But he said nothing to tout their records in Congress on behalf of Floridians and instead praised each for cable-television battle scars suffered on Trump\u2019s behalf.\n\n\u201cSo great to me on television,\u201d Trump said of Rooney. \u201cI love it when he defends me.\u201d\n\nThe election on Tuesday will also help answer the question of whether Trump\u2019s movement is lasting, broad and transferrable \u2014 or whether, like so much else, it is singular to him.\n\nMany House incumbents struggling to hold seats in suburban areas are keeping their distance from the president because he is so toxic in their districts, while some Senate candidates in red states are casting themselves as mini-Trumps.\n\nConsider the contrast between two Republican Senate challengers who campaigned this past week with Trump. In Florida, a perennial swing state, Gov. Rick Scott has trod carefully in his dealings with the president as he runs for Senate. Scott has appeared with Trump mostly at official events, such as the president\u2019s visit last month to survey hurricane damage in the Florida Panhandle, but Scott took a gamble and hugged Trump on stage at Wednesday\u2019s rally in Estero. Moments later, however, Trump railed about birthright citizenship and suggested \u201ccriminals\u201d and \u201cdrug dealers\u201d were benefiting from the constitutional right to citizenship for children born in the United States, regardless of their parents\u2019 immigration status, complicating Scott\u2019s appeal to Latino voters.\n\nThe next night in Missouri, a state Trump won by 19 percentage points in 2016, Senate candidate Josh Hawley was gushing in his adoration of Trump, praising the president\u2019s record on border security, taxes and judicial nominations. \u201cBecause of the leadership of Donald Trump, on November the 6th, we\u2019re going to call Claire McCaskill fired!\u201d Hawley said, handing the lectern over to Trump.\n\nIf Democrats are successful Tuesday, it could be a day of firsts.\n\nMore women than ever are running for Congress this year. More than 120 candidates are running for the House for the first time.\n\nDemocrats have nominees that could become the first Muslim women, the first Palestinian American, the first Native American woman in Congress.\n\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who is 29, is poised to become the youngest woman ever elected to Congress. Stacey Abrams in Georgia could become the country\u2019s first female black governor, while in Florida, Andrew Gillum could become his state\u2019s first African American governor.\n\nDemocratic gubernatorial nominee Jared Polis in Colorado could be the first openly gay person elected as governor.\n\nThe challenge for Republicans can be seen in voters like Donald Burch, a 68-year-old semiretired salesman who attended Trump\u2019s rally Friday night in Indianapolis.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty happy because he kept his promises he made when he was running and he\u2019s willing to stand up and be counted,\u201d Burch said. \u201cYou can\u2019t argue with his results.\u201d\n\nBut even as he stood in a snaking line to attend Trump\u2019s rally, he would not publicly commit to voting for Republican Senate candidate Mike Braun. Burch said he is considering voting to reelect Sen. Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.) because he believes \u201cwithout a doubt\u201d it makes for better government when one party holds the presidency and another controls Congress.\n\n\u201cNo one power can go unchecked,\u201d Burch said.\n\nSome GOP allies are concerned that congressional Republicans have not sufficiently adopted the policies on which Trump won in 2016. They floundered on an attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act \u2014 and now many are running on a pledge to preserve its most popular provision, which ensures health-care coverage for those with preexisting conditions.\n\nThey passed a tax-cut bill that many initially touted but which could cost Republican seats in suburban areas because it limited real estate tax deductions that are popular in upper-middle-class enclaves. Republicans have also continued talking about hard-line immigration proposals even though they have not been able to pass any legislation even though they control all levers of power.\n\n\u201cIf I asked you right now what Trump\u2019s slogan was two years ago, you could tell me,\u201d said John McLaughlin, a Republican consultant who was Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign pollster. \u201cWhat\u2019s the Republican slogan for Tuesday? What\u2019s their message for Tuesday? There is no message. People vote for a reason. You need a reason.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight now, the only one with a message is the president. The president is single-handedly keeping them in the game,\u201d he added. \u201cWe should be doing better, but, unfortunately, we didn\u2019t pass most of the president\u2019s agenda. We didn\u2019t repeal health care, we didn\u2019t build the wall . . .

Thousands of wary Central American migrants resumed their push toward the United States on Sunday, a day after arguments over the path ahead saw some travelers splinter away from the main caravan, which is entering a treacherous part of its journey through Mexico. (Marco Ugarte/Associated Press)\n\nISLA, Mexico \u2014 Thousands of bone-tired Central Americans set their sights on Mexico City on Sunday, after undertaking a grueling journey through a part of Mexico that has been particularly treacherous for migrants seeking to get to the United States.\n\nThe majority of the roughly 4,000 migrants streamed into the town of Cordoba in the Gulf coast state of Veracruz, a gateway to the central part of the country 124 miles from their previous stop. The day\u2019s trek was one of the longest yet, as the exhausted migrants tried to make progress walking and hitching rides toward the U.S. border still hundreds of miles away.\n\nIt is unclear what part of the U.S. border they will aim for eventually, but their latest overnight stay in Veracruz could be one of their last before they head to Mexico City, a potential launching spot for a broader array of destinations.\n\nIn the capital, they may also receive additional support, although Mexican officials have appeared conflicted over whether to help or hinder their journey.\n\nManuel Calderon, 43, a migrant from El Salvador, knew many miles lay ahead and said he wanted to \u201cspeed up the pace.\u201d He said he was fleeing violence in his home country and had dreams of making it back to the U.S., from which he was deported a little more than two years ago.\n\nOn the road, he was greeted by ordinary Mexicans lending a hand. Catalina Munoz said she bought tortillas on credit to assemble tacos of beans, cheese and rice when she heard the migrant caravan would pass through Benemerito Juarez, her tiny town of 3,000 inhabitants. She gathered 15 others to help make the tacos, fill water bottles and carry fruit to weary travelers on the roadside.\n\nAs migrants began filing into a sports complex in Cordoba, others had already hopped freight trucks to Puebla and even Mexico City. A few arrived at a large outdoor stadium in the capital and lounged on bleachers a day after divisions beset the ranks of the caravan over which route to take.\n\nSome were disappointed after organizers unsuccessfully pleaded for buses after three weeks on the road. Others were angry for being directed northward through Veracruz, calling it the \u201croute of death.\u201d\n\nThe trek past the state\u2019s sugar fields and fruit groves has taken the majority through a state where hundreds of migrants have disappeared in recent years, falling prey to kidnappers looking for ransom payments. Authorities there said in September they had discovered remains from at least 174 people buried in clandestine graves, raising questions about whether the bodies belonged to migrants.\n\nBut even with the group somewhat more scattered, most of the migrants were convinced that traveling as a large mass was their best hope for reaching the U.S. The migrants generally say they are fleeing rampant poverty, gang violence and political instability primarily in the Central American countries of Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua.\n\n\u201cWe think that it is better to continue together with the caravan. We are going to stay with it and respect the organizers,\u201d said Luis Euseda, a 32-year-old from Tegucigalpa, Honduras, traveling with his wife, Jessica Fugon. \u201cOthers went ahead, maybe they have no goal, but we do have a goal and it is to arrive.\u201d\n\nMynor Chavez, a 19-year-old from Copan, Honduras, was determined to continue.\n\n\u201cI have no prospects (in Honduras). I graduated as a computer technician and not even with a degree have I been able to find work,\u201d he said of his home country.\n\nMexico faces the unprecedented situation of having three migrant caravans stretched over 300 miles (500 kilometers) of highway in the states of Chiapas, Oaxaca and Veracruz.\n\nOn Friday, a caravan from El Salvador waded over the Suchiate River into Mexico, bringing around 1,000 people who want to reach the U.S. border. That caravan initially tried to cross the bridge between Guatemala and Mexico, but Mexican authorities told them they would have to show passports and visas and enter in groups of 50 for processing.\n\nAnother caravan, also of about 1,000 people, entered Mexico early in the past week. That group includes Hondurans, Salvadorans and some Guatemalans.\n\nThe first, and largest, group of mainly Honduran migrants entered Mexico on Oct. 19.\n\nMexico\u2019s Interior Ministry estimated Saturday that there are more than 5,000 migrants in total currently moving through southern Mexico via caravans or in smaller groups. The ministry says 2,793 migrants have applied for refuge in Mexico in recent weeks and around 500 have asked for assistance to return to their countries of origin.\n\nUncertainty awaits migrants who reach the U.S.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has ordered U.S. troops to the Mexican border in response to the caravans. More than 7,000 active duty troops have been told to deploy to Texas, Arizona and California ahead of the midterm elections.\n\nHe plans to sign an order that could lead to the large-scale detention of migrants crossing the southern border and bar anyone caught crossing illegally from claiming asylum.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Amy Guthrie in Mexico City contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Four of the islands, known as the Northern Territories in Japan and the southern Kuril islands in Russia, are disputed and remain a bitter sticking point between Tokyo and Moscow. (KAZUHIRO NOGI/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nJapan has a lot of uninhabited islands, about 158 of which the government named in 2014 to ensure that the water around them continues to belong to Japan.\n\nBut now, one of those islets has disappeared, Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun reported this week. And no one seemed to notice until now.\n\nThe Japanese Coast Guard is apparently planning to search for the islet, called Esanbehanakitakojima, about one-third of a mile away from Sarufutsu, a village on Hokkaido island.\n\nHiroshi Shimizu, an author who published a picture book about Japanese islands, was the one who reported that the islet wasn\u2019t where it\u2019s supposed to be. He wanted to visit Esanbehanakitakojima as part of a follow-up book project, but the Japanese newspaper reported that he just couldn\u2019t find it. That\u2019s when he reached out to Sarufutsu\u2019s village fishery to ask where it might be.\n\nIt turns out the Japanese Coast Guard had last surveyed the islet in 1987, and it was known to be around 4\u00bd feet above sea level.\n\nBut now it can\u2019t be seen from land at all.\n\n\u201cThere is a possibility that the islet has been eroded by wind and snow and, as a result, disappeared,\u201d senior coast guard official Tomoo Fujii told the Asahi Shimbun newspaper.\n\nA coast guard official also told Agence France-Presse that the disappearance \u201cmay affect Japan\u2019s territorial waters a tiny bit . . . if you conduct precision surveys.\"\n\nLand disappearances are not unheard of. A study published in Environmental Research Letters in 2016, for example, found that five reef islands in the Pacific Ocean\u2019s Solomon Islands had disappeared between 1947 and 2014. That study determined that although sea-level rise has caused erosion in the central Pacific, research in the western Pacific found that \u201cextreme events, sea walls and inappropriate development\u201d were likely responsible for the majority of shoreline changes in that region.\n\nFor its part, Japan has taken measures to ensure it lays claim to certain islands to avoid further territorial disputes with its neighbors.\n\nIn 2016, Japan announced it would spend $107 million to rebuild the observatory tower on a Pacific island called Okinotorishima, which is about 1,000 miles south of the capital Tokyo.\n\nThe Guardian reported at the time that Beijing had claimed the island was made of only rocks and thus disqualified Japan from including it in its exclusive economic zone. A United Nations convention claimed that \u201crocks which cannot sustain human habitation or economic life of their own\u201d don\u2019t qualify for such a zone.\n\nRead more\n\nChina and Japan pledge to take their relationship in \u2018new historic direction\u2019\n\nJapan\u2019s prime minister, a Trump buddy, now tries to cozy up to China\u2019s president\n\nJapan\u2019s Abe stakes out new identity in region: Stronger leadership and wider military reach", "LONDON \u2014 British emergency services say eight children have been hurt when an inflatable slide collapsed at a fireworks display in southern England.\n\nThe accident happened as thousands gathered Saturday to watch Bonfire Night fireworks in Woking, 25 miles (40 kms) southwest of London.\n\nJournalist Andy Datson said he saw up to 40 children playing on the slide, which he estimated was about 30 feet tall and \u201clooked pretty flimsy.\u201d\n\nWitnesses say an air ambulance arrived and families were evacuated from the site after the incident.\n\nSurrey Police said \u201ca number\u201d of children had fallen from the slide.

(Dominic Bracco II/Prime/FTWP)\n\nGun-carrying civilian groups and border vigilantes have heard a call to arms in President Trump\u2019s warnings about threats to American security posed by caravans of Central American migrants moving through Mexico. They\u2019re packing coolers and tents, oiling rifles and tuning up aerial drones, with plans to form caravans of their own and trail American troops to the border.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll observe and report, and offer aid in any way we can,\u201d said Shannon McGauley, a bail bondsman in the Dallas suburbs who is president of the Texas Minutemen. McGauley said he was preparing to head for the Rio Grande in coming days.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve proved ourselves before, and we\u2019ll prove ourselves again,\u201d he said.\n\nMcGauley and others have been roused by the president\u2019s call to restore order and defend the country against what Trump has called \u201can invasion,\u201d as thousands of Central American migrants advance slowly through southern Mexico toward the U.S. border. Trump has insisted that \u201cunknown Middle Easterners,\u201d \u201cvery tough fighters,\u201d and large numbers of violent criminals are traveling among the women, children and families heading north on foot.\n\n[Migrant caravan: What Trump\u2019s threats sound like to the Central Americans trudging north]\n\nThe Texas Minutemen, according to McGauley, have 100 volunteers en route to the Rio Grande who want to help stop the migrants, with more likely on the way.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t put a number on it,\u201d McGauley said. \u201cMy phone\u2019s been ringing nonstop for the last seven days. You got other militias, and husbands and wives, people coming from Oregon, Indiana. We\u2019ve even got two from Canada.\u201d\n\nAsked whether his group planned to deploy with weapons, McGauley laughed. \u201cThis is Texas, man,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd yet, the prospect of armed vigilantes showing up beside thousands of U.S. troops \u2014 along with Border Patrol agents, police officers and migrants \u2014 is considered serious enough that military planners have issued warnings to Army commanders.\n\nAccording to military planning documents obtained by Newsweek, the military is concerned about the arrival of \u201cunregulated militia members self-deploying to the border in alleged support\u201d of U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\n\n[Army assessment of migrant caravans undercuts Trump\u2019s rhetoric]\n\nThe assessment estimates that 200 militia members could show up. \u201cThey operate under the guise of citizen patrols,\u201d the report said, while warning of \u201cincidents of unregulated militias stealing National Guard equipment during deployments.\u201d\n\nThe military report provided no further details about the alleged thefts.\n\nManuel Padilla Jr., the top Border Patrol official in the agency\u2019s Rio Grande Valley sector, the nation\u2019s busiest for illegal crossings, said he has not issued any instructions to agents in the field or to landowners whose properties are adjacent to the river. But he plans to meet with community members in the coming week, he said, to address their concerns.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have any specific information about the militias,\u201d said Padilla, reached by phone along the border. \u201cWe have seen them in the past, and when things start getting really busy, we have to make sure to let the community know they\u2019re out there.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut they\u2019re doing that on their own,\u201d Padilla said.\n\n[Trump vows to block asylum seekers in caravan but offers few details]\n\nMcGauley said that in addition to weapons and camping gear, his group will have night-vision goggles and aerial drones with thermal sensing equipment, capable of operating in darkness. He emphasized that the group would report any suspicious activity to authorities and would heed any instructions from Border Patrol agents or military personnel.\n\nSeveral landowners in the area said they do not want the militias around.\n\nMichael Vickers, a veterinarian and rancher who lives an hour north of the border in Falfurrias, said that he will not let militia members from outside the area onto his property and that he doubts most area landowners would trust outsiders.\n\n\u201cThey are a bunch of guys with a big mouth and no substance to them,\u201d said Vickers, a Republican who heads the 300-strong Texas Border Volunteers. The group doesn\u2019t call itself a militia, although it patrols ranchland to intercept migrants who hike through the brush to attempt to avoid Border Patrol checkpoints. The group uses ATVs, night-vision goggles, spotlights and trained dogs.\n\n\u201cPeople on the [Rio Grande] have been calling us,\u201d Vickers said. His group is in a \u201cholding pattern,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cWe can have 100 volunteers in a hot area in four to eight hours.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve already talked to a bunch of landowners who wanted to know if we\u2019ll be operating if the Border Patrol can\u2019t be there to keep their property from being vandalized and their crops from being messed up.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re ready to move,\u201d he said.\n\n[South Texas county faces wave of migrant deaths]\n\nOthers in South Texas are less enthusiastic.\n\nLucy Kruse, 96, said immigrants often stop on her property as they walk through the bush country, sometimes breaking into a small cabin to sleep. Her family\u2019s ranch lies amid the thorny mesquite brush, cactus and tawny dry grass 80 miles north of the border.\n\nAs the migrant caravans head north, she and other landowners in the area worry that the number of trespassers walking through their ranches will increase dramatically. But many say the militias coming to the area also pose a threat.\n\n\u201cI will not let militia on my land,\u201d Kruse said. \u201cThey\u2019re civilians stepping into a situation where the Border Patrol is supposed to be in control and make decisions. They could damage property or harm workers. I would guess they would be trigger-happy. If they shot someone, they might just say the person they shot was reaching for a gun.\u201d\n\nJoe Metz, 80, lives in what looks like a pastoral tropical paradise near Mission, a town of 84,000 in the Rio Grande Valley. Tall, green sugar cane grows beside the wide river, and citrus trees dot the sandy small hillocks away from the banks.\n\nThe Rio Grande is less than a mile from Metz\u2019s living room window, and a section of border wall crosses his property. He has watched for years as border-crossers ford the river and walk onto his land, their first step on American soil. The wall has slowed the flow significantly, he said, but between 50 and 100 people a day still cross through the farm next door.\n\nHe worries that the caravan, which includes many women and children, will surge through the area, but he doesn\u2019t want armed vigilantes on his farm.\n\n\u201cThe militia just needs to stay where they are,\u201d said Metz, a Republican. \u201cWe don\u2019t need fanatical people. We don\u2019t need anybody here with guns. Why do they have guns? I have dealt with illegals for 30 years, and all of them have been scared, asking for help. The militias need to stay up north where they belong. We have no use for them here. They might shoot someone or hurt someone.\u201d\n\n[Trump on throwing rocks at the border: Military will consider that a threat]\n\nThe heir to the state\u2019s largest and most influential ranch said he thinks the militias could pose a threat of their own. Stephen J. \u201cTio\u201d Kleberg, who has lived most of his life on the 825,000-acre King Ranch outside of Kingsville, said he will allow federal and state law enforcement and the military onto his property, which is larger than the state of Rhode Island, but he won\u2019t let private militia beyond the gates.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they have a governing body,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are independent and not authorized by anybody. It could lead to individuals taking action without someone in authority supervising. I think that could be dangerous.\n\n\u201cI think if the [caravan members] get across the river, they need to be caught and sent back,\u201d said Kleberg, who wears a bushy handlebar mustache and chews an unlit cigar.\n\n\u201cOnce they get on U.S. soil, they need to be stopped and detained. We don\u2019t have enough Border Patrol, ICE and Highway Patrol to handle them. If we get 2,000 or 3,000 people, we will need the military,\u201d Kleberg said.\n\nCorrection: In a prior version of this story, Texas rancher Stephen J. \u201cTio\u201d Kleberg said he would allow private militias onto his property to confront migrants crossing into the United States illegally.

A player said language Court used made him feel \u201cless than human.\u201d Evans, the report said, couldn\u2019t recall hearing that grievance.

It shouldn\u2019t be overlooked that the commission charged with examining the culture of Maryland football outlined how Maryland\u2019s athletic department was so dysfunctional in recent years that staff morale sank, that former strength and conditioning coach Rick Court \u201cwas effectively accountable to no one,\u201d and that a rift between Evans and his predecessor and former boss, Kevin Anderson, basically engulfed the entire department.\n\nIt\u2019s worth remembering \u2014 because Evans can\u2019t \u2014 that Evans fielded a complaint about Court, a rogue actor to be sure, in 2016. A player said language Court used made him feel \u201cless than human.\u201d Evans, the report said, couldn\u2019t recall hearing that grievance. Nor could he recall an email Anderson forwarded him in which a player alleged mistreatment by Durkin. Evans\u2019s response, essentially: I hadn\u2019t seen any such behavior, so it must not have happened. Now how can I backstab and butt-kiss my way to the big chair?\n\nThis is the guy you want selecting your next football coach? This is the guy you want healing a broken department?\n\nSorry, sorry. Saturday was about the kids.\n\nThey have, essentially, next Saturday\u2019s game at Indiana to become bowl eligible because the following two weeks bring Ohio State and Penn State, and, well, that\u2019s life in the Big Ten East. Reaching some random bowl game \u2014 the Heart of Dallas Bowl, anyone? \u2014 would be a minor footnote to this tumultuous season. The big questions will remain: Who will lead this program going forward, and who will make that choice?\n\nBut you know what a bowl bid would do for these Terrapins? It would give them another month together. Another month to practice but another month to heal. Watching them run out to that No. 79 and take a knee, it\u2019s clear that healing\u2019s not over. With the old coach gone, it has just moved to another stage.\n\nFor more by Barry Svrluga, visit washingtonpost.com/svrluga.", "Qasem Soleimani, the Commander of the Quds Force, Iran\u2019s external security agency, has posted this image on his Instagram in response to Trump\u2019s tweet. pic.twitter.com/l1zdRIBK9f \u2014 Yashar Ali \ud83d\udc18 (@yashar) November 3, 2018\n\nFans of the series \u201cA Song of Ice and Fire,\u201d already upset that HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d adaptation has advanced past the novels and spoiled their plot, can now only watch in horror as the series is appropriated into a propaganda war between the United States and Iran, neither of which displays the slightest appreciation for the subtle intricacies of author George R.R.

Republicans are favored to keep control of the Senate, but enough top-tier races from Florida to Nevada to Tennessee and Missouri were sufficiently close that the outcome was in doubt. And in two closely watched gubernatorial races, where African American Democrats in Georgia and Florida are seeking to make history, the contests looked to be coming down to the wire.\n\nMuch is on the line.\n\nTuesday brings the first test of whether the outpouring of liberal energy \u2014 visible in the sea of pink hats during the Women\u2019s March as well as the record number of female candidates, the protesters who showed up at airports after the Muslim travel ban and the activists who coalesced around \u201cthe resistance\u201d \u2014 can be converted into votes for what had been a beleaguered Democratic Party. It also will demonstrate whether Trump can mobilize his army of backers \u2014 \u201cthe silent majority,\u201d as he termed it in 2016 \u2014 to vote for other Republicans when his name is not atop the ballot.\n\nThe outcome will set the tone for the bigger battle to come, the 2020 presidential race, with Trump testing his messages and what is likely to be a crowded field of Democrats scouring the landscape for clues about how to challenge the president.\n\n\n\nPresident Trump attends a rally for Republican U.S. Senate candidate Matt Rosendale at the Bozeman Yellowstone International Airport in Belgrade, Mont., on Nov. 3, 2018. (Carlos Barria/Reuters)\n\nThe anxiety, and energy, are palpable on both sides.\n\nTrump, closing the campaign with racially charged warnings about an approaching migrant \u201cinvasion,\u201d told cheering supporters in Indiana that the country will decide whether \u201cwe let the radical Democrats take control of Congress and take a giant wrecking ball to our economy and to our future.\u201d\n\nFormer president Barack Obama, who has emerged in the campaign\u2019s closing days as an aggressive campaigner for Democrats, told supporters in Miami that the \u201ccharacter of our country is on the ballot.\u201d\n\nA sense of foreboding, meanwhile, was setting in for many Democrats, who want to believe the experts who say their party has an edge in the battle for the House but recall the pain of their misplaced optimism two years ago. They are haunted by the failure in 2016 to turn out enough black, Hispanic and young voters \u2014 and can\u2019t fathom how they will feel about their country if the Trump-led GOP prevails again.\n\n\u201cIt all started in 2016. I sat there and cried that night,\u201d said Stacee Wilhite, a 41-year-old stay-at-home mom who became involved in politics this year for the first time, campaigning for a Democratic candidate north of Los Angeles. \u201cWe tell each other, \u2018We can\u2019t let up. We have to keep pushing. Just look at what happened in 2016.\u2019 We could lose by one seat. That\u2019s what makes us so nervous.\u201d\n\nThe intensity on both sides has been apparent in the surge of early voting. More than 33 million early votes have been cast, surpassing the 2014 midterm voting totals and in some places approaching presidential-level turnout, according to Michael McDonald, an associate professor at the University of Florida who tracks early voting.\n\nAdding to the tension are the simmering, raw emotions that remain after an outbreak of apparently politically motivated violence. First there was a string of mail bombs sent to Trump critics by a supporter of the president. Then came the massacre of 11 Jews in a Pittsburgh synagogue, allegedly carried out by an anti-Semitic gunman who had espoused anger at the same caravan of Central American refugees that has drawn the ire of Trump and his allies.\n\nMany Democrats have argued that Trump\u2019s response to those tragedies \u2014 further stoking fear and trying to run ads that CNN deemed too racist to carry \u2014 have helped them attract previously pro-GOP suburban voters, just as Trump built a new coalition in 2016 by usurping working-class voters who had been loyal Democrats for a generation.\n\n\u201cIt is different from two years ago in terms of unequivocal enthusiasm that [Democrats] have to vote, how open independents are to hearing an argument and how necessary it is to make sure we correct whatever vile suppression of the vote is being put out there by the Republicans,\u201d House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said in an interview.\n\nIf Republicans see large losses, losing control of one or both chambers of Congress, Trump could be forced to recalibrate and give Democrats a chance to pounce \u2014 issuing subpoenas, launching investigations and potentially starting impeachment proceedings.\n\nBut if Republicans maintain control, their victory could reaffirm Trump\u2019s vision of the country, emboldening him to pursue his immigration policies, crack down on special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigation and renew efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cHanding the Democrats the keys to our government in 4 days would be no different from handing matches to an arsonist,\u201d read a fundraising email from the Republican National Committee on Friday. \u201cThey would have full power to launch any investigation they want against anyone they want, and without any corroborating evidence.\u201d\n\nTrump, who has thrown himself into the campaign fray with an intensity unusual for presidents in midterms, is trying to do what then-President Obama failed to achieve in the 2010 and 2014 elections: Motivate the legions of supporters who cast ballots for him for president to vote in midterm elections for other Democrats.\n\n\u201cNobody thought of the midterms as being that big a deal for years \u2014 for years,\u201d Trump said at a Thursday night rally in Columbia, Mo. \u201cYou know, you hear \u2018midterms,\u2019 it\u2019s like let\u2019s go to sleep, right? This year, we\u2019re breaking every single record in attendance for the midterms.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d rallies are ostensibly orchestrated to help lift local Republican candidates for the U.S. Senate, House and governorships, but Trump has been focusing mostly on himself \u2014 and has sounded more like a candidate for reelection than a surrogate for others. He speaks for an hour or more at each stop about what he describes as record-breaking accomplishments and what he terms \u201cthe greatest political movement in American history.\u201d\n\nAt a rally in the past week in Estero, Fla., Trump singled out two area congressmen up for reelection, Reps. Francis Rooney and Matt Gaetz. But he said nothing to tout their records in Congress on behalf of Floridians and instead praised each for cable-television battle scars suffered on Trump\u2019s behalf.\n\n\u201cSo great to me on television,\u201d Trump said of Rooney. \u201cI love it when he defends me.\u201d\n\nThe election on Tuesday will also help answer the question of whether Trump\u2019s movement is lasting, broad and transferrable \u2014 or whether, like so much else, it is singular to him.\n\nMany House incumbents struggling to hold seats in suburban areas are keeping their distance from the president because he is so toxic in their districts, while some Senate candidates in red states are casting themselves as mini-Trumps.\n\nConsider the contrast between two Republican Senate challengers who campaigned this past week with Trump. In Florida, a perennial swing state, Gov. Rick Scott has trod carefully in his dealings with the president as he runs for Senate. Scott has appeared with Trump mostly at official events, such as the president\u2019s visit last month to survey hurricane damage in the Florida Panhandle, but Scott took a gamble and hugged Trump on stage at Wednesday\u2019s rally in Estero. Moments later, however, Trump railed about birthright citizenship and suggested \u201ccriminals\u201d and \u201cdrug dealers\u201d were benefiting from the constitutional right to citizenship for children born in the United States, regardless of their parents\u2019 immigration status, complicating Scott\u2019s appeal to Latino voters.\n\nThe next night in Missouri, a state Trump won by 19 percentage points in 2016, Senate candidate Josh Hawley was gushing in his adoration of Trump, praising the president\u2019s record on border security, taxes and judicial nominations. \u201cBecause of the leadership of Donald Trump, on November the 6th, we\u2019re going to call Claire McCaskill fired!\u201d Hawley said, handing the lectern over to Trump.\n\nIf Democrats are successful Tuesday, it could be a day of firsts.\n\nMore women than ever are running for Congress this year. More than 120 candidates are running for the House for the first time.\n\nDemocrats have nominees that could become the first Muslim women, the first Palestinian American, the first Native American woman in Congress.\n\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who is 29, is poised to become the youngest woman ever elected to Congress. Stacey Abrams in Georgia could become the country\u2019s first female black governor, while in Florida, Andrew Gillum could become his state\u2019s first African American governor.\n\nDemocratic gubernatorial nominee Jared Polis in Colorado could be the first openly gay person elected as governor.\n\nThe challenge for Republicans can be seen in voters like Donald Burch, a 68-year-old semiretired salesman who attended Trump\u2019s rally Friday night in Indianapolis.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty happy because he kept his promises he made when he was running and he\u2019s willing to stand up and be counted,\u201d Burch said. \u201cYou can\u2019t argue with his results.\u201d\n\nBut even as he stood in a snaking line to attend Trump\u2019s rally, he would not publicly commit to voting for Republican Senate candidate Mike Braun. Burch said he is considering voting to reelect Sen. Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.) because he believes \u201cwithout a doubt\u201d it makes for better government when one party holds the presidency and another controls Congress.\n\n\u201cNo one power can go unchecked,\u201d Burch said.\n\nSome GOP allies are concerned that congressional Republicans have not sufficiently adopted the policies on which Trump won in 2016. They floundered on an attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act \u2014 and now many are running on a pledge to preserve its most popular provision, which ensures health-care coverage for those with preexisting conditions.\n\nThey passed a tax-cut bill that many initially touted but which could cost Republican seats in suburban areas because it limited real estate tax deductions that are popular in upper-middle-class enclaves. Republicans have also continued talking about hard-line immigration proposals even though they have not been able to pass any legislation even though they control all levers of power.\n\n\u201cIf I asked you right now what Trump\u2019s slogan was two years ago, you could tell me,\u201d said John McLaughlin, a Republican consultant who was Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign pollster. \u201cWhat\u2019s the Republican slogan for Tuesday? What\u2019s their message for Tuesday? There is no message. People vote for a reason. You need a reason.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight now, the only one with a message is the president. The president is single-handedly keeping them in the game,\u201d he added. \u201cWe should be doing better, but, unfortunately, we didn\u2019t pass most of the president\u2019s agenda. We didn\u2019t repeal health care, we didn\u2019t build the wall . . . If we don\u2019t win the House, it\u2019s because we didn\u2019t get enough done.\u201d\n\nMike DeBonis contributed to this report.", "FILE - In this July 21, 2018 file photo, Johnny Depp appears in character as Gellert Grindelwald at the Warner Bros.

Logistically, Qatar pulled off the 2018 world gymnastics championships largely without a hitch, yet the majority of the 10-day event was played in front of sparse crowds at the Aspire Dome. (Vadim Ghirda/Associated Press)\n\nDOHA, Qatar \u2014 All the usual bells and whistles were there. The pyrotechnic introductions. The in-house deejay heavy on American pop music. An aggressive social media campaign replete with its own hashtag (#GoGymtastic). The bright colors on the competition floor. Oh, and perhaps the greatest gymnast of all time at the height of her astonishing powers.\n\nOnly one thing seemed to be missing during the world championships\u2019 first visit to the Middle East: people.\n\nThe majority of the sessions during the 10-day meet that ended Saturday were held in front of significant swaths of empty blue and yellow seats at the Aspire Dome. Most of the audience wore pink lanyards with laminated ID cars attached, a clear giveaway that they weren\u2019t paying customers but members of one of the dozens of gymnastic federations who flocked to the desert for the sport\u2019s marquee event, one that at times seemed more like a convention than anything else.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really different,\u201d Simone Biles said after leading the U.S. women to gold in the team final in front of an arena that was half-filled at best. \u201cIt almost felt like it wasn\u2019t world championships out there because there\u2019s not a lot of people in the crowd and most of the crowd was made up of delegations. But it\u2019s so exciting to see the delegation out here supporting everyone in your own country.\u201d\n\nLogistically there were few hiccups, another small positive step for a country preparing to host the world track and field championships in 2019 and soccer\u2019s World Cup in 2022.\n\nThe buses ran on time and getting around in general wasn\u2019t a problem in a place where an Uber could be found. Save for a handful of brief downpours \u2014 including one that flooded one of the training gyms and another that led to a brief power outage on the floor during women\u2019s qualifying, the weather cooperated too, with temperatures in the mid-80s.\n\nConcerns about how the culture of a sport that preaches openness would be received in a conservative Muslim country evaporated quickly. The proof lay next door at a massive shopping mall, where many of the gymnasts spent their down time walking around in shorts and T-shirts alongside Qataris in culturally traditional attire.\n\nAnd yet four years of meticulous preparations by the local organizing committee did little to spark widespread interest in a sport that\u2019s still trying to gain a foothold in the region.\n\nMinutes before the women\u2019s team final Tuesday, Americans Anne Josephson, Nicole Caggiano and Tina Ferriola \u2014 all of whom own gyms in the U.S. \u2014 and Matt Goldsmith walked along a sparse concourse before what is typically the biggest night of every world championships. They marveled at how many good seats were still available, the gymnastics equivalent of the Golden State Warriors winning an NBA title in front of friends and family and little else.\n\n\u201cThere are more people in my gym on a Wednesday morning taking \u2018Mommy and Me\u2019 classes than there are in here right now and it\u2019s really sad,\u201d said Josephson, who runs Jag Gym in Culver City, California.\n\nJosephson read the U.S. State Department report on Qatar before her group purchased tickets and wasn\u2019t worried about safety, though she pointed out she chose to wear black pants despite the heat because she wanted to \u201cfollow the rules.\u201d\n\nWhile they anticipated an environment that wasn\u2019t quite as frenzied as what they experienced at the 2017 worlds in Montreal last year \u2014 when thousands of Canadians flocked to Olympic Stadium \u2014 they were struck by the lack of buzz inside the arena, which had a capacity of about 2,500 for the event.\n\n\u201cWhat an experience that we\u2019re about to have, all 60 of us together,\u201d Ferriola said. \u201cNow we all are like good friends because this is a very intimate experience.\u201d\n\nOrganizers did what they could to engage younger Qataris, holding demonstrations in the run-up to the meet and using multiple social media platforms to provide a close look at the athletes. They gave away tickets to local schools and on the day of the men\u2019s all-around final offered 50 percent off for adults and allowed children under 10 to get in free. And still the stands were nowhere close to full.\n\nSave for a couple of storefront banners close to the massive Aspire Zone \u2014 the sprawling complex in the western suburbs that served as the host of the 2006 Asian Games \u2014 and the random bus, there was little proof Biles was chasing history. Meanwhile, signs promoting a professional squash tournament lined lampposts that ran down the median of Al Corniche Street in front of the city\u2019s signature downtown skyline.\n\n\u201cWe are still building a sporting culture in our region, this cannot be done overnight,\u201d Ali Al-Hitmi, CEO of the local organizers wrote in an email to The Associated Press. \u201cWe have seen the numbers in the crowd grow each day over the course of the 10-day event. The atmosphere itself has swept across our country and word of mouth has seen many ticket purchases on the door at Aspire Dome.\u201d\n\nThe International Gymnastics Federation praised the Qatar for its effort and said it had received \u201cno major complaints\u201d from the delegations, though the federation expressed concern about the lackluster numbers \u2014 particularly early on\u2014 and placed the blame on a competition schedule designed to appease TV rights holders across the globe.\n\nThe team, all-around and event finals all began at 4 p.m. local time, the height of rush hour in a city of over a million people. Many families head home for evening prayer immediately after work or school, making getting to a two-hour meet difficult. Attendance did perk up during the event finals, which were held on Friday and Saturday, the weekend in Qatar.\n\nAmerican Morgan Hurd felt an uptick in the energy while competing in the floor exercise finals on Saturday but also allowed she received a boost because she could hear Biles shouting out her support, something that\u2019s typically difficult to pick out when music is blaring and the stands are packed.\n\nThe world championships head to Stuttgart, Germany, next October, and ticket sales are brisk.

Remember this on Tuesday. #vote #voterepublican\"\n\nCNN\u2019s public relations department promptly fired back at the president\u2019s eldest child, repeating a statement that the network\u2019s reporters had made last week: The ad was racist.\n\n\u201cCNN has made it abundantly clear in its editorial coverage that this ad is racist,\u201d CNN PR tweeted. \u201cWhen presented with an opportunity to be paid to take a version of this ad, we declined. Those are the facts.\u201d\n\nCNN has made it abundantly clear in its editorial coverage that this ad is racist. When presented with an opportunity to be paid to take a version of this ad, we declined. Those are the facts. \ud83c\udf4e \u2014 CNN Communications (@CNNPR) November 3, 2018\n\nThe full ad, released and tweeted out by the president on Halloween, showed a smiling and unremorseful Bracamontes as he bragged in the courtroom: \u201cI killed [expletive] cops. They\u2019re [expletive] dead. I don\u2019t [expletive] regret that [expletive]. . . . I will break out soon and I will kill more.\u201d (In the advertisement, the actual expletives are heard.)\n\nThere is no subtlety to the message the ad is trying to telegraph: Migrants are killers and criminals, and Democrats comprise the party that enable them.\n\nIndeed, the ad \u201cdispenses with whatever restraint Trump may have exercised with his divisive immigration rhetoric,\u201d as The Washington Post\u2019s media critic Erik Wemple described in a recent column:\n\nIn his tweet promoting the video ad, Trump writes, \u201cIt is outrageous what the Democrats are doing to our Country. Vote Republican now!\u201d As the ad cycles through Bracamontes\u2019s chilling threats in the courtroom, a banner reads, \u201cDEMOCRATS LET HIM INTO OUR COUNTRY.\u201d The focus then switches to footage of a migrant caravan overwhelming fences at a checkpoint, and then to a Fox News clip in which a migrant tells a translator that he plans on seeking a pardon for the \u201cfelony he committed \u2026 attempted murder.\u201d Again, the multitudes splash across the screen, with this banner, \u201cWHO ELSE WOULD DEMOCRATS LET IN?\u201d ... The video stigmatizes a large group of people of color as criminals \u2014 killers bent on coming in and killing the law-abiding residents of the United States. It\u2019s another in the long list of shocking-but-not-surprising developments in the Trump presidency. This is Trump\u2019s remarks about Mexico\u2019s \u201crapists\u201d in video format.\n\nAs Wemple noted, after the ad was released, a slew of media outlets dispensed with the usual equivocations \u2014 \u201cracially charged,\u201d \u201cracially tinged\u201d and the like \u2014 and described the commercial as outright \u201cracist\u201d (CNN), \u201cdivisive\u201d (NBC News) and \u201cfearmongering\u201d (HuffPost).\n\n[Trump\u2019s new immigration ad was panned as racist. Turns out it was also based on a falsehood.]\n\nMoreover, the lines about Democrats letting Bracamontes stay in the country didn\u2019t hold up to a fact check, as The Post\u2019s Eli Rosenberg reported. Bracamontes was deported in 1997 and 2001, under both Democratic and Republican administrations, according to local newspapers at the time. Bracamontes also apparently was arrested, then released, in Phoenix in 1998.\n\nIf Trump Jr. was miffed by CNN\u2019s retort, though, he didn\u2019t show it. The president\u2019s son, who once claimed to be so busy running the family business that he had nearly \u201czero contact\u201d with his father, has been aggressively campaigning for several Republican candidates in recent weeks.\n\nThroughout Saturday, Trump Jr. retweeted others critical of CNN, including attacks on CNN anchor Don Lemon, who had recently said that \u201cthe biggest terror threat in this country is white men.\u201d Trump Jr. also shared a clip of a CNN interviewer talking to who she thought was a random person at a rally for Florida gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum. The person turned out to be Gillum\u2019s mother.\n\n[CNN's Don Lemon doubles down after saying white men are 'the biggest terror threat in this country']\n\n\u201cNo wonder you\u2019re the fakest name in news. #fakenews,\u201d Trump Jr. tweeted at CNN.\n\nLike his son, President Trump has regularly attacked CNN on Twitter and in his rally speeches. The president once tweeted a doctored video clip that showed him slamming a man representing \u201cCNN\u201d to the ground. Another time he retweeted an image depicting \u201cCNN\u201d squashed beneath his shoe.\n\nOn Saturday, CNN representatives included an apple emoji in its reply to Trump Jr., a reference to the \u201cFacts First\u201d campaign the station launched last year to try to fight claims by Trump \u2014 and his supporters \u2014 that the network is \u201cfake news.\u201d Though CNN\u2019s \u201cFacts First\u201d video never called out Trump by name, it hinted at tactics used by the president.\n\n\u201cThis is an apple.

(Jonathan Newton / The Washington Post)\n\nThe circumstances seemed ripe. A win would have given the Maryland Terrapins something positive, a fitting way to cap off a week of mayhem. But after a chaotic series of events that included DJ Durkin\u2019s reinstatement as head coach before Tuesday\u2019s practice and his firing after Wednesday\u2019s practice, Maryland struggled on the field Saturday against Michigan State.\n\nThe Terps\u2019 offense could not find any rhythm in the 24-3 loss at Maryland Stadium, similar to how the unit has fared against other strong defenses this season. Instead of an inspired performance with bowl eligibility on the line, Maryland (5-4, 3-3 Big Ten) totaled only 100 offensive yards against the Spartans (6-3, 4-2).\n\nDown by 14 points in the fourth quarter, Maryland nearly caught a break. Defensive lineman Byron Cowart intercepted a pass and almost made it into the end zone, but he fumbled and Michigan State recovered for a touchback. On the next play, the Spartans' Connor Heyward scored on an 80-yard run. What could have become a seven-point deficit with 11 minutes left in the game turned into a 21-point margin in Michigan State\u2019s favor.\n\n\u201cOur kids are disappointed because they didn\u2019t play their best football,\u201d interim coach Matt Canada said. \u201cAnd we were still right there. We make that score, it\u2019s 17-10, 11 minutes to go, we\u2019re right in the game.\u201d\n\n[Perspective: It\u2019s a mess, and it\u2019s so damn hard, but Maryland football plays on]\n\nThough some members of the team, in the wake of Durkin\u2019s brief return, pushed back by posting on social media and by walking out of a team meeting, Saturday\u2019s game marked the first time this week that the players truly controlled the outcome of a situation. All of the other events of the week, ones that intimately affect the lives of those in the program, had been left up to 17 members of the University System of Maryland Board of Regents and the school\u2019s administration.\n\nCanada said he could not speak to how the events of this week affected the players, and no players were made available to the reporters after the loss.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve had a big week, a challenging week,\u201d Canada said. \u201cThat\u2019s the great thing about this game, we went out there and played football today. And our guys were ready to play.\u201d\n\nEllis McKennie \u2014 the offensive lineman who grew up down the street from Jordan McNair and became one of the team\u2019s most prominent voices this week \u2014 carried the No. 79 tribute flag onto the field, setting the scene for what could have been a few hours of motivated play. But the Terps will have to wait another week to try to reach bowl eligibility.\n\n[In grief and in defiance, the Terps\u2019 line holds]\n\nSaturday\u2019s game was reminiscent of the road matchup against Iowa, when the Hawkeyes held the Terps scoreless. Maryland opened the game against Michigan State with a few cringeworthy offensive series in windy conditions. The Spartans\u2019 defense sacked Maryland\u2019s quarterbacks five times, and when starter Kasim Hill did have time to throw, he missed receivers a handful of times. Tyrrell Pigrome came into the game in the fourth quarter, and the offensive production did not improve.\n\nHill completed 8 of 21 passes for 74 yards, and Pigrome threw incompletions on all three of his attempts.\n\nOn top of the passing woes, the rushing attack hardly worked against Michigan State, which has the best run defense in the nation. Including sacks, Maryland only gained 26 yards on the ground. After leaving last week\u2019s game with a calf strain, Ty Johnson did not play on Saturday, leaving Maryland without one of its best running backs.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t come in here thinking we were going to run the ball down the field on them,\u201d Canada said.\n\nIf the five sacks, which count as runs, are excluded, Maryland had the same number of rushing and passing plays, despite spending most of the season using a run-heavy offense.\n\nThroughout the game, Maryland came up short in crucial moments, failing to take advantage of an opportunity that offered a glimmer of hope.\n\nAfter taking a timeout on Michigan State\u2019s opening possession, the Terps\u2019 defense allowed a fourth-down conversion on a drive that ended with a touchdown. In the second quarter, Maryland lined up to go for a fourth down of its own but instead moved five yards back thanks to a false start and punted.\n\nA well-placed punt pushed Michigan State near its end zone later in the first half and the Terps\u2019 defense nearly notched a safety, but somehow the Spartans gained yardage on the play. When Maryland had optimal field position after RaVon Davis intercepted a Michigan State pass, the Terps managed to find themselves with 18 yards to go on third down and had to punt. The Terps later lost defensive lineman Mbi Tanyi after he threw a punch.\n\n\u201cWe just have to find a way to make critical plays at critical times,\u201d Canada said. \" . . . When you\u2019re playing a team like Michigan State, every drive matters.\"\n\nFellow student-athletes lined the field as the team ran out, showing unified support for the program in the wake of chaos, but by the end of the game, just a large contingent of Michigan State fans remained in the stands and Maryland left the field with a loss in hand.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hopeful that our kids will come in tomorrow like they have every other day, look at each other and wish we would have won,\u201d Canada said. \u201cBut we\u2019re still here together, and we have 20 days left to enjoy being around each other. That\u2019s what football is.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\n\u2018A long, arduous task\u2019: Inside the U-Md. leadership crisis\n\nAmong Maryland football players, a mix of relief, tension and uncertainty\n\nJerry Brewer: Maryland\u2019s players found their voice as their university floundered\n\nPetula Dvorak: When colleges put winning football games above all else\n\nBarry Svrluga: Maryland rights a wrong \u2014 but it remains a long way from being out of the woods\n\nCalls grow for Maryland president to stay on", "Mail bombs, a military response to a migrant caravan and the massacre at a Pittsburgh synagogue have injected a roller coaster of fear and anger to the homestretch of midterm campaigning. But the stakes of Tuesday\u2019s election, analysts say, are two very different paths on key issues.\n\nIf Democrats wrestle control of the House of Representatives, Americans can expect a push to expand health care access, increase taxes on the wealthy and corporations, and hold industries \u2014 and the Trump administration \u2014 accountable with more stringent regulations and oversight.\n\nIf Republicans manage to retain both chambers of Congress, the country is likely to see new attempts to gut the Affordable Care Act \u2014 despite claims by GOP candidates that they would protect patients with preexisting medical conditions, a move to expand tax cuts and continued loosening of regulations.\n\nThe possibilities could be sharply curtailed depending on the returns: The most likely scenario, which has Democrats controlling the House and Republicans holding the Senate, is apt to lead to gridlock as both sides immediately pivot to messaging for the 2020 presidential campaign.\n\nHealth care ranks as highly important to voters, polls this year have shown.\n\n\u201cRegardless of why people are voting, the outcome of the election will have huge consequences for the direction of the debate over health care,\u201d said Larry Levitt, senior vice president of the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan nonprofit headquartered in San Francisco.\n\nIn states and districts won narrowly by President Trump, Democrats have watched Republicans repackage themselves as defenders of Medicare and of the most popular parts of the ACA.\n\nJust a handful of Republican campaigns have run ads about the migrant caravan that has captured the White House\u2019s attention. By contrast, dozens are running ads that promise to keep the ACA\u2019s rules preventing insurers from discriminating against customers with preexisting conditions \u2014 even as party leaders push a lawsuit to repeal the measure protecting such coverage.\n\n\u201cI support forcing insurance companies to cover preexisting conditions,\u201d Florida Gov. Rick Scott, the Republican nominee for a U.S. Senate seat, says in one of his closing ads.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m leading the fight to secure our border [and] force insurance companies to cover preexisting conditions,\u201d Rep. Martha McSally of Arizona, a Republican Senate nominee who voted to repeal Obamacare, says in another one.\n\nDetails on how Republicans would protect coverage of preexisting conditions remain vague. Health policy analysts have pointed out that it would be financially unfeasible to force insurers to cover preexisting conditions without mandating that people, including those who are healthy, buy insurance \u2014 a provision of the ACA that Republicans repealed in last year\u2019s tax bill.\n\nRepublicans also have not come to any agreement over how to handle the broader issue of health care, said Doug Heye, a Republican strategist and former spokesman for the Republican National Committee.\n\n\u201cOn the House Republican side, I worked on [ACA replacement language] every day for six months in 2014, and we couldn\u2019t even produce a white paper,\u201d Heye said.\n\nAnother ACA provision, expanding Medicaid for low-income Americans, got a boost during the campaign from Democrats and in typically conservative states \u2014 with ballot measures to do so in Utah, Idaho, Nebraska and Montana. The measures are expected to pass in Utah and Idaho, with Republican support.\n\n\u201cThe closing argument for many Democrats has been protecting the gains made under the ACA,\u201d said Steve McMahon, a Democratic strategist, \u201cand they will be taking measures to reinforce, strengthen or fix things Republicans have been trying to undo, overturn or ignore.\u201d\n\nBut divisions over health care also hover over Democrats, who analysts say will face pressure, if they gain a majority, to move toward universal health coverage, given that a number of Democratic gubernatorial candidates and potential presidential contenders have endorsed \u201cMedicare-for-all.\u201d\n\nThat debate would raise questions about a critical facet: how to pay for it.\n\nOn the fiscal front, Republicans contend that Democrats would unwind last year\u2019s tax cut. But neither Democratic leaders nor most of the party\u2019s candidates have said they would repeal the tax cut. As they did after two rounds of tax cuts in 2001 and 2003, Democrats instead have promised to revisit the tax law to make the wealthy pay more, sparing middle-class voters from changes.\n\nIf Democrats win the House, their committee leaders are expected to introduce oversight into Trump administration activities.\n\n\u201cWe will begin to see checks and balances that haven\u2019t existed,\u201d said Norman Ornstein, a political scientist and resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.\n\nThe regulatory environment and dynamics of the fight over the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, gutted under Trump, would also change with a substantial Democratic House majority, said Kevin Madden, a Republican strategist.\n\n\u201cAnd the I word \u2014 both investigations and impeachment \u2014 would certainly be on the table,\u201d Madden said.\n\nDemocratic strategist McMahon said he hopes Democrats, if they are put back in charge, will remember to focus on the concerns of \u201cordinary Americans\u201d \u2014 health care, the environment and climate change, income inequality and tax fairness \u2014 and not just \u201can endless stream of subpoenas.\u201d\n\nSome even see an opportunity, however slim, for dealmaking with Trump on guns, immigration and infrastructure if a realignment in Congress occurs.\n\nTrump has occasionally suggested that Democrats could work with him on infrastructure spending, though the Democratic Party\u2019s own bills \u2014 it introduced a $1 trillion package in 2017, to preempt a Trump plan that never came \u2014 differ wildly on how much federal versus private investment would be required up front.\n\nWith much of Washington at an impasse and poised to stay that way, many of the issues most concerning voters, from gun control to abortion access and infrastructure to education, will play out instead in the states.\n\n\u201cGovernors are becoming less and less reticent to act on policy that in the past has been left to Congress,\u201d said Jennifer Duffy, senior editor of the independent Cook Political Report. She cited gun safety legislation tracked by the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence as an example, noting that since 17 people were killed in February at a high school in Parkland, Fla., 27 governors, including 14 Republicans, have signed gun laws.\n\nAbortion rights have motivated Democrats this election cycle more than at any time in the past decade, according to a September Pew poll showing that 61 percent of Democrats view the issue as \u201cvery important\u201d to their vote compared with 44 percent of Republicans. Among Democrats, that figure rose 23 points since 2008 while it remained constant for Republicans.\n\nThe political environment shifted at about the same time the poll was taken, as the Senate considered Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination to the Supreme Court. His confirmation has heightened fears among Democratic women, in particular, that their right to abortion could be in jeopardy if the high court reverses its 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that decriminalized abortion and sends the matter back to the states. Several conservative states have already restricted access to abortions.\n\nIn Michigan, where Democrats have taken the lead in statewide races, the party\u2019s nominee for governor, Gretchen Whitmer, has released a plan to protect abortion rights regardless of future Supreme Court rulings. Michigan has yet to repeal a 1931 state law banning most abortions despite the Roe v. Wade decision.\n\nWhitmer has been helped by the struggles of the Republican nominee, Bill Schuette, the state\u2019s two-term attorney general, who had repeatedly sued to repeal the ACA. Schuette also has said that as governor, he would enforce the state law banning abortion should the Supreme Court overturn Roe v. Wade. While Schuette has pledged to keep the state\u2019s Medicaid expansion if elected, Whitmer has pointed out that the expansion would vanish overnight if Schuette\u2019s legal battle paid off.\n\nBut on the campaign trail, voters leaning toward Whitmer are sometimes less focused on her individual policies than on the possibility of building a resistance to the Trump administration. At a recent get-out-the-vote stop in the Detroit suburb of Royal Oak, Whitmer told voters that people and communities who felt threatened would be protected if she won.\n\n\u201cWhen we win, LGBT people go into the governor\u2019s office,\u201d Whitmer said. \u201cWhen we win, clean water is on the agenda.\u201d\n\nMarissa Bassan, 19, signed up on the spot to help encourage voting. This election, she said, is about putting up blockades against a Republican agenda that isn\u2019t slowing down.\n\n\u201cPeople need a shield from what\u2019s going on in Washington,\u201d Bassan said. \u201cI want to have actual laws, not anarchy.\u201d", "TEHRAN, Iran \u2014 Israel\u2019s prime minister has praised the restoration of U.S. sanctions on Iran that were lifted under the 2015 nuclear deal.\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu, a staunch opponent of the agreement concluded by the Obama administration, said Saturday that President Donald Trump had made an \u201chistoric\u201d decision by restoring sanctions against \u201cthe murderous terror regime in Iran that is endangering the entire world.\u201d\n\nIn a statement from his office, Netanyahu said \u201cthe effect of the initial sanctions is already felt,\u201d referring to a financial crisis in Iran that has triggered sporadic protests.\n\nThe Trump administration restored sanctions targeting Iran\u2019s shipping, financial and energy sectors on Friday, but carved out exemptions for eight countries that can still import oil from Iran without penalty.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

But to hear President Trump tell it, the Georgia Democrat is unqualified.\n\nTrump has not said exactly why he thinks Abrams is unqualified, but he has communicated why he thinks Ron DeSantis, a former Republican congressman running for governor in neighboring Florida, is.\n\nLast week, Trump sent out a tweet Monday in support of DeSantis, citing his Yale undergraduate education and 5\u00bd years in the House of Representatives.\n\nLast Thursday, he opined on Abrams, telling reporters: \u201cShe is not qualified to be the governor of Georgia, not qualified.\"\n\n\u201cTake a look at her past, take a look at her history, take a look at what she wants to do and what she has in mind for the state. That state will be in big, big trouble very quickly, and the people of Georgia don\u2019t want that,\u201d Trump said.\n\nBut this past Sunday, Abrams dismissed the president\u2019s assessment of her abilities. She said on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press:\n\n\u201cI find his assessments to be vapid and shallow. I am the most qualified candidate. I am a business owner. I am a tax attorney who was trained at Yale Law School. I am a civic leader who helped register more than 200,000 Georgians.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at Abrams\u2019s past and compare it with that of DeSantis, who Trump thinks would be \u201ca great governor.\u201d\n\nAbrams has a doctorate from Yale Law School, the top law school in the nation, according to U.S. News & World Report. It\u2019s also the same law school as Trump\u2019s most recent Supreme Court pick, Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh. She also has a master\u2019s degree in public policy and has a longer lawmaking career than DeSantis, even serving as minority leader in Georgia\u2019s House of Representatives.\n\nDeSantis held no leadership positions while in Congress. And Brian Kemp, Abrams\u2019s Republican opponent in the governor\u2019s race, also held no leadership positions while serving the state Senate. (Kemp is Georgia\u2019s secretary of state, but he has been accused of using that position to suppress the vote of more than 50,000 Georgia residents by refusing to approve their registration applications. A judge has ordered that they be allowed to vote.)\n\nIn fact, Abrams has more elite education and lawmaking experience than Trump himself. So how could she be \u201cunqualified\u201d for the job for which some say she\u2019s been preparing since the days when Trump was a Democrat?\n\nRacism and sexism, according to Trump critics.\n\nI had the privilege of being in some meetings with Stacey Abrams a couple of years ago & it\u2019s clear to me that based on Intelligence, work ethic & competence, Trump is no Stacey Abrams. What Trump really means is that no black person can be qualified. Let\u2019s call this what it is. https://t.co/d9iLgkVFPJ \u2014 Joyce Alene (@JoyceWhiteVance) November 1, 2018\n\nOur #BigotPresident, continuing his theme of belittling the intelligence and competence of women of color, called @StaceyAbrams \"not qualified.\" Abrams holds a law degree from Yale and has 17 years of political experience. https://t.co/8wFSl7n9V8 #VoteAbrams \u2014 Democratic Coalition (@TheDemCoalition) November 2, 2018\n\nYesterday, @realDonaldTrump said Desantis is more qualified because graduated from Yale.\n\n\n\nToday, he says Stacey Abrams isn\u2019t qualified even though she graduated from Yale Law.\n\n\n\nMaybe Trump thinks \u201cqualified\u201d is a synonym for \u201cwhite\u201d \u2014 michaelharriot (@michaelharriot) November 2, 2018\n\nJudging by his comments and the policies he proposes, many Americans consider Trump to be racist and sexist. Given Abrams\u2019s identity as a black woman, some conclude that this makes her \u201cunqualified\u201d to be the most powerful politico in Georgia, a state that Trump won in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nTrump has a history of dismissing black women and the concerns and experiences that they bring to the table.\n\nAbrams supporter Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) \u2014 who Trump frequently calls \u201ca low IQ\u201d individual \u2014 is one of his most frequent targets of derision. And media icon Oprah Winfrey, who campaigned for Abrams this week, has found herself on the receiving end of Trump attacks, after conversations about her running against Trump in 2020 picked up.\n\nIn the 2016 exit polls, 76 percent of black women said they were \u201cscared\u201d of a Trump win. And in a Gallup poll the summer before the election, 72 percent of black women said they \u201cstrongly agreed\u201d that they were afraid of what would happen if their preferred candidate did not win the election.\n\nThis is perhaps why black women are one of the groups that voted against Trump at the highest rate in 2016 \u2014 and are expected to continue to show their lack of support for the Republican Party in this year\u2019s midterm elections.\n\nTrump knows this and lobs vague but dismissive terms like \u201cunqualified\u201d toward Abrams because it is effective with his base by speaking to the \u201ccultural anxiety\u201d many expressed about a diversifying America without having to actually unpack his attack.\n\nTo Trump\u2019s base, which is well represented in Georgia, Abrams is unqualified, despite her many merits. But also consider that Georgia is on track to be the first Southern state that will be majority-minority and that Abrams\u2019s identities, experience and worldview reflect those of many of the state\u2019s residents.\n\nUltimately, Trump is arguing that Abrams lacks the qualifications to lead Georgia in the type of nation that he and his supporters envision.\n\nAnyone paying attention to Georgia\u2019s gubernatorial race knows that Abrams has no interest in backing Trump\u2019s vision. She wants to dismantle it.", "", "\n\nFox News senior Capitol Hill producer Chad Pergram will be on the call for Saturday's Capitals radio broadcast. (Fox News) (FOX News)\n\nChad Pergram has spent weeks consulting two binders: one on the coming midterm elections, the other with his insights on the Washington Capitals. He has cheat sheets for pronunciation in each: for congressional candidates' names in one and for foreign NHL stars in the other. He\u2019s charting campaign spending in one and average ice time in the other.\n\nThe Fox News senior Capitol Hill producer will be on the Capitals' radio call on Saturday night when the team faces off against the Dallas Stars as the third man in the booth with John Walton and Ken Sabourin. Ben Raby is out for the night.\n\nPergram will be responsible for the intermission reports, game resets toward the end of each period and spots on the pregame and postgame shows. He says it\u2019s a broadcasting dream come true a couple of decades in the making. Below is an interview with Pergram about his first hockey broadcast. Questions and answers have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nHow\u2019d you become a hockey fan and a Caps fan? And how\u2019d this radio gig come to be?\n\nI worked in radio for many, many years, starting in Cincinnati when I was in high school, and I\u2019ve always been a sports fan. And in Cincinnati, southwest Ohio, you don\u2019t have an NHL team. So when I moved to Washington after grad school, the Caps became my hockey team. I\u2019ve gone to games for 25 years. And when you go to school at Miami of Ohio, you live in Swing Hall, and the old hockey arena used to be just across the parking lot. So that\u2019s kind of how I got hooked on hockey.\n\nJohn Walton, who is of course the voice of the Caps, is a fellow Miami grad. I didn\u2019t know him well when we were at Miami. He\u2019s a little younger than me, and so he was in undergrad when I was in grad school. He and I crossed paths a couple of times, but when he came out here I said: \u201cHey, congrats on the new gig. We\u2019ve met some years ago, let\u2019s go to dinner.\u201d And we just became friends and talk hockey a lot. He told me Ben Raby was going to be out and asked if I would be game to do it.\n\nI think it\u2019s good to get out of your comfort zone once in a while. I know Capitol Hill pretty well. I know motions to recommit, and I know the budget reconciliation process. I know the cloture rule in the Senate. But I\u2019d like to think I know a little something else about faceoff violations, bench minors and being in the crease rule, too. So it\u2019s good to get outside your comfort zone and try something that\u2019s a little bit different. And Capitol Hill can be a contact sport much like hockey as well.\n\nDid you play hockey growing up? And have you ever covered hockey?\n\nI have never put on skates to play hockey. Not once. I played sports. I played soccer, played baseball. I\u2019ve studied martial arts for many years, and so it\u2019s not it\u2019s not a thing that I wasn\u2019t somebody who played sports. But a lot of times you\u2019re a product of your parents. There was no hockey in southwest Ohio except over at Miami, which is not very far from where I grew up, but it\u2019s just my dad was very much into baseball. I grew up in the 1970s, and so it was the Big Red Machine of Pete Rose and Johnny Bench.\n\nI will say this: I might not have had interest in being a hockey player, but I thought about two different routes I could go professionally was being a sports announcer or being a news broadcaster. And the reason I interned at WKRC radio in high school was they carried the Bengals games and I thought I would do sports. And I wound up in the newsroom and never did any sports. I always did news, and to some degree I\u2019ve always covered Congress. A couple of years later I covered this guy\u2019s first race for Congress, a guy by the name of John Boehner, who became speaker of the House. He was the local congressman. And the guy who lived in the fraternity house down the street from me at Miami was a guy named Paul Ryan, who\u2019s now speaker of the House.\n\n\n\nChad Pergram has been a Capitals fan since moving to the D.C. area after getting hooked on hockey in college at Miami of Ohio. (Fox News) (FOX News)\n\nHow are you preparing for your first hockey broadcast?\n\nMy wife and I were on vacation in western Canada last week. We go on hockey road trips a lot of times, but we never got to see the Capitals play. And so we wound up getting to see them in Edmonton. That was that was a little bit of preparation even though I didn\u2019t know I was doing the broadcast at the time. That\u2019s one type of prep, watching games. I\u2019ve been watching the Dallas games the past couple of days and spending a lot of time on pronunciation.\n\nI have a list here with the midterm elections Tuesday. There\u2019s a bunch of House candidates who I\u2019ve never met who I\u2019m not sure how to say their name because they haven\u2019t been elected yet. People like Guy Reschenthaler (Rec-on-soll-er) in Pennsylvania the 14th District against Bibiana Boerio (Bib-E-ah-no Bor-E-O). But by the same token, I\u2019m working on Julius (U-li-us) Honka and Miro Heiskanen (Hace-can-en) and Anton Khudobin (Koo-doh-bin) with Dallas. You write them up phonetically. I was watching Dallas. They played Montreal the other night. Of course the Caps played Montreal recently, too, and Jesperi Kotkaniemi (Yes-per-E Coat-kin-E-nem-E) scored two goals Thursday night. I learned today from our friends at the Embassy of Finland that Kotkaniemi means \u201ceagle peninsula.\u201d So that goes into my notes.\n\nDo you see any similarities between covering politics and covering hockey?\n\nI\u2019m told that there\u2019s some postgame scrums in the locker room, where reporters all gather around someone and ask them questions, and those types of things happen in politics, too. There\u2019s a hearing, or you get somebody off the floor. Everybody knows who they need to talk to. It\u2019s the same principle in that regard.\n\nI went to New Hampshire in 2008 for the presidential election. And I went to the Manchester Monarchs minor league game. This is when they were the Kings\u2019 AHL affiliate. But its New Hampshire during the primary. Politics is part of the game. And so Kevin Westgarth, he got a pretty good scuffle that night. And I interviewed him in the locker room, and he said, \u201cI would rather deal with fighting somebody on the ice than dealing with some of the dirty behind-the-scenes stuff that they do in politics.\u201d He said out on the ice, it\u2019s all straight up. It\u2019s right out there in front of you. And I think that that\u2019s kind of the case as well.\n\nRead more from The Post:\n\nForbes cuts ties with sports business columnist, deletes piece about WNBA player salaries\n\nA writer tweeted a racist caricature of Eric Reid.

(Evan Vucci/AP)\n\n\u201cThis election will decide whether we build on the extraordinary prosperity that we\u2019ve achieved or whether we let the radical Democrats take control of Congress and take a giant wrecking ball to our economy and to the future of our nation,\u201d Trump said.\n\nHe also accused Democratic leaders of pushing for \u201csocialist\u201d health care and wanting to \u201cerase\u201d U.S. borders and \u201cinvite caravan after caravan\u201d of Central American migrants into the country.\n\nThe president carried a similar message to Pensacola, Fla., where he seized on the troop mobilization at the border to argue that Republicans, not Democrats, were best able to keep citizens safe. \u201cI watched that barbed wire being put down. Barbed wire,\u201d Trump told thousands of supporters at the airplane-hangar rally. Referring to the migrants, he said: \u201cWe don\u2019t want that in our country. We\u2019re not going to have it in our country.\u201d\n\n[Trump\u2019s new immigration ad was panned as racist. Turns out it was also based on a falsehood.]\n\nThe respective speeches came amid a final push by luminaries in both parties to drive up turnout for elections that will determine control of Congress, dozens of governorships and down-ballot races around the country.\n\nA day after acknowledging that Republicans could lose the House on Tuesday, Trump largely focused on Senate and gubernatorial races.\n\nDemocrats need to net 23 seats to take control of the House, and they need to gain two seats to win the majority in the Senate, where the map is more favorable to Republicans.\n\nTrump\u2019s appearance in Montana was his fourth on behalf of Republican Matt Rosendale, who is seeking to knock off Sen. Jon Tester (D) there. Trump has trained his sights on Tester in part for his role in sinking Trump\u2019s nomination of Ronny L. Jackson to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs in April. Tester, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Veterans\u2019 Affairs Committee, released a list of allegations that portrayed a long history of professional misconduct by Jackson.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never forgotten it, and honestly, it\u2019s one of the reasons I\u2019ve been here so much,\u201d Trump told his crowd. \u201cJon Tester tried to ruin him.\u201d\n\nDuring the rally, he also plugged the reelection of Rep. Greg Gianforte (R-Mont.), who garnered national headlines for assaulting a reporter last year. \u201cHe is fantastic,\u201d Trump said of Gianforte, adding that he is \u201cvery respected in Washington.\u201d\n\nUpon leaving Belgrade, Mont., Trump headed to another rally in Florida, which also has a marquee Senate race this year.\n\nIn Florida, Trump is also trying to bolster the fortunes of Republican gubernatorial hopeful Ron DeSantis, a candidate he endorsed during the GOP primary, who has been lagging in polls behind Democrat Andrew Gillum. If elected, Gillum would be the state\u2019s first black governor.\n\nAt the Pensacola rally, Trump said Gillum is ill-equipped for the job. \u201cI will say this: Andrew Gillum is not equipped to be your governor,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe\u2019s just not equipped. It\u2019s not for him. It\u2019s not for him.\u201d\n\nVice President Pence, meanwhile, was dispatched to Wisconsin on Saturday to help the reelection bid of embattled Gov. Scott Walker (R) and will later join Trump in Florida.\n\n\u201cThis race is as close as it can be. It\u2019s a dead heat,\u201d Pence told a crowd in Hudson, Wis., while wearing navy blue jacket emblazoned with Walker\u2019s name. \u201cEvery vote counts.\u201d\n\nThe flurry of activity comes on the heels of high-profile appearances Friday by former president Barack Obama and Trump, who has urged supporters to act as though his name is on the ballot Tuesday. Obama plans to be back on the trail Sunday, seeking to give a boost to Democrats in Indiana.\n\nUnderscoring Republican jitters about losing the House, a super PAC backed by House Republican leaders announced Saturday that it is coming to the aid of Rep. Don Young (R-Alaska), who has represented his state\u2019s at-large congressional district since 1973. The Congressional Leadership Fund said it would conduct a \u201chyper-targeted\u201d get-out-the-vote effort on Young\u2019s behalf to relay the message that the \u201cextreme, liberal agenda\u201d of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) \u201cwould be a disaster for Alaska.\u201d\n\nMuch of Trump\u2019s closing argument has centered on immigration, with the president casting Democrats as wanting to turn the nation into a sanctuary for undocumented immigrants. During Saturday\u2019s Montana rally, Trump addressed criticism that he has talked more about immigration than the economy, which many Republicans consider to be the party\u2019s strongest argument ahead of the midterms.\n\nTrump pointed out correctly that he had addressed the economy earlier in his remarks, but he said there was only so much he could say about job reports and other positive indicators before losing his audience.\n\n\u201cI can only go for four or five minutes with that stuff,\u201d Trump said, adding that he also wants to talk about \u201cproblems we want to fix.\u201d\n\nDuring his remarks, he asserted that Democrats want to allow undocumented immigrants to vote because it will help their election prospects. \u201cWhat do they really want? The right to vote,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey figure that\u2019s the way they stay in office forever.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign committee released a television ad on Friday focused on immigration. It features images of Luis Bracamontes, an undocumented immigrant who was convicted of killing two sheriff\u2019s deputies in California in 2014, and a migrant caravan moving through Mexico toward the U.S. border.\n\n\u201cStop the caravan. Vote Republican,\u201d the ad concludes.\n\nIn a tweet, Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale said the campaign was spending $1.5 million on the buy and complained that CNN was refusing to air the ad.\n\nThe network responded with a statement Saturday: \u201cCNN has made it abundantly clear in its editorial coverage that this ad is racist. When presented with an opportunity to be paid to take a version of this ad, we declined. Those are the facts.\u201d\n\nWhile flying between rallies Saturday, Trump sought to make immigration a wedge issue in the race for a Senate seat from Arizona. In a tweet, he said that Republican Rep. Martha McSally would provide \u201cBorder Security\u201d and asserted her Democratic opponent, Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, whose name he misspelled, \u201cdoesn\u2019t even think about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf it were up to Sinema \u2014 drugs, crime and illegal traffic will be flowing into Arizona at an ever increasing pace.\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cVote for Martha!\u201d\n\nIn one of two rallies Friday, Trump acknowledged to a crowd in West Virginia that Republicans could lose control of the House but sounded optimistic about his party\u2019s prospects in the Senate.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing really well in the Senate, but could happen,\u201d Trump said of losing the House. \u201cAnd you know what you do? My whole life \u2014 you know what I say? Don\u2019t worry about it. I\u2019ll just figure it out.\u201d\n\nDuring a television interview Saturday, Pelosi said she is confident Democrats will win control of the House on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI speak from the ground. I\u2019ve traveled all over the country,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cThe enthusiasm is something that I\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d\n\nObama stumped Friday in Georgia for Democratic gubernatorial hopeful Stacey Abrams, touting her as \u201cthe most experienced, the most qualified candidate in this race.\u201d That was a retort to Trump, who had called Abrams \u2014 who would be the nation\u2019s first black female governor \u2014 \u201cnot qualified.\u201d\n\nAbrams, who faces Republican Brian Kemp, Georgia\u2019s secretary of state, has been the beneficiary of a string of prominent visitors, including media mogul Oprah Winfrey.\n\n\u201cI think it is a signal of how important Georgia is to America,\u201d Abrams said Saturday morning on MSNBC.\n\nWhile many of the same issues have driven midterm races across the country, a new ad from a Texas congressional race underscored how contours differ from contest to contest.\n\nDemocrat MJ Hegar posted the one-minute ad on Friday after her opponent, Rep. John Carter (R), compared their campaign to a war. In the ad, Hegar, who served three tours in Afghanistan as a combat search-and-rescue pilot, tells Carter: \u201cWell, respectfully congressman, you don\u2019t know . . . about war.\u201d\n\nAn expletive is bleeped out.\n\nPhilip Rucker contributed to this report.", "President Trump and former vice president Joe Biden issued dueling warnings Saturday about the dire consequences of the other\u2019s party emerging from Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections with control of Congress.\n\nAppearing in Ohio, Biden asserted that Republicans want to strip insurance coverage from people with preexisting health conditions and \u201ceviscerate\u201d Medicare and Social Security, two of the country\u2019s popular entitlement programs.\n\nBiden also sought to frame the election as a referendum on Trump\u2019s leadership, relaying that foreign leaders with whom he continues to speak have been taken aback by many of the president\u2019s actions.\n\n\u201cThe very character of our country is on the ballot on Tuesday,\u201d Biden said in Parma Heights, Ohio, where he appeared alongside Democratic Senate and gubernatorial candidates. \u201cFolks, all the world\u2019s looking.\u201d\n\n[Trump concedes GOP could lose control of House]\n\nAt a Montana rally a few hours later, Trump asserted that the real danger would be a takeover of Congress by \u201cradical Democrats.\u201d\n\n\n\nPresident Trump waves to the crowd Saturday as he arrives for a campaign rally at Bozeman Yellowstone International Airport in Belgrade, Mont.

The migrants had already made a grueling 40-mile (65-kilometer) trek from Juchitan, Oaxaca, on Thursday, after they failed to get the bus transportation they had hoped for. But hitching rides allowed them to get to Donaji early, and some headed on to a town even further north, Sayula. (Rodrigo Abd/Associated Press)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump spread distorted theories and numbers on immigration in the campaign\u2019s final days while claiming economic gains for minorities that have not been achieved.\n\nA look at 11th hour rhetoric before the elections Tuesday and the reality:\n\nMEDIAN INCOME\n\nTRUMP, on attracting the nonwhite vote from Democrats: \u201cWe have the best unemployment numbers, the best median income numbers for all of these groups. We have the best numbers we\u2019ve ever had. ...They should be worried about the African-Americans, because they\u2019re going to lose them.\u201d \u2014 Fox interview Monday.\n\nTHE FACTS: He did not achieve the best median income numbers for all the nonwhite groups. Both African-Americans and Asian-Americans had higher income prior to the Trump administration.\n\nThe median income last year for a black household was $40,258, according to the Census Bureau. That\u2019s below a 2000 peak of $42,348 and also statistically no better than 2016, President Barack Obama\u2019s last year in office.\n\nMany economists view the continued economic growth since the middle of 2009, in Obama\u2019s first term, as the primary explanation for recent hiring and income gains. More important, there are multiple signs that the racial wealth gap is now worsening even as unemployment rates have come down.\n\nAs to Asian-Americans, the median income for a typical household last year was $81,331. It was $83,182 in 2016.\n\n___\n\nILLEGAL IMMIGRATION\n\nTRUMP, on the practice of allowing immigrants caught crossing the border illegally to stay in U.S. communities as they await immigration hearings: \u201cWe\u2019re not doing releases. What\u2019s been happening over years is they would come in, release them, and they would never show up for their trial. And we now have 25 or 30 million people in this country illegally, because of what\u2019s been happening over many years.\u201d \u2014 remarks Wednesday to reporters.\n\nTHE FACTS: It\u2019s nowhere close to 25 million to 30 million, nor has the number increased much in recent years.\n\nThe nonpartisan Pew Research Center estimates there were 11.3 million immigrants in the U.S. illegally in 2016, the most recent data available. That number is basically unchanged from 2009. Advocacy groups on both sides of the immigration issue have similar estimates.\n\nThe number of such immigrants had reached a height of 12.2 million in 2007, representing about 4 percent of the U.S. population, before declining due in part to a weakening U.S. economy.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP, on tweeting a video blaming Democrats allowing a man to enter the U.S. who killed two police officers: \u201cAll I\u2019m doing is just telling the truth.\u201d \u2014 speaking to reporters Friday.\n\nTHE FACTS: The video he spread around does not tell the truth. It says Democrats let Luis Bracamontes into the country and \u201clet him stay.\u201d\n\nBracamontes entered the U.S. illegally, in 1996, during the Democratic administration of President Bill Clinton, but he was also deported by that administration the next year after being caught buying crack cocaine and serving his sentence. He returned repeatedly. By the time he was sentenced to death in California for the 2014 killings of the police officers, he had been deported four times, according to Sacramento County Sheriff Scott Jones.\n\nNo evidence of leniency by Democrats has emerged in the episode. Democratic and Republican administrations alike have deported hundreds of thousands of people a year and no administration, Trump\u2019s included, has caught everyone trying to enter illegally.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP on what U.S. troops should do if encountering migrants who are trying to get to the border from Mexico: \u201cI didn\u2019t say shoot, I didn\u2019t say shoot.\u201d \u2014 remarks to reporters Friday.\n\nTHE FACTS: A day earlier, he said of the migrants: \u201cThey want to throw rocks at our military, our military fights back. I told them, consider it a rifle.\u201d\n\nThe procession has been largely peaceful. Some migrants in one caravan clashed with Mexican police at the Mexico-Guatemala border, hurling stones.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP: \u201cPresident Obama separated the children from parents and nobody complained. When we continued the exact same law, the country went crazy.\u201d \u2014 immigration speech Thursday.\n\nTHE FACTS: Actually, Obama did not do the same thing as a matter of policy.\n\nWhile it\u2019s true the underlying laws were the same, the Trump administration mandated anyone caught crossing the border illegally was to be criminally prosecuted. That policy meant adults were taken to court for criminal proceedings, and their children were separated and sent into the care of the Health and Human Services Department, which is tasked with caring for unaccompanied migrant children. Trump\u2019s zero tolerance policy remains in effect, but he signed an executive order June 20 that stopped separations.\n\nJeh Johnson, Obama\u2019s Homeland Security secretary, recently told NPR there may have been unusual or emergency circumstances when children were taken from parents, but there was no such policy.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP: \u201cAt this very moment, large well-organized caravans of migrants are marching towards our southern border. Some people call it an invasion. ...These are tough people in many cases; a lot of young men, strong men and a lot of men that maybe we don\u2019t want in our country. ...This isn\u2019t an innocent group of people. It\u2019s a large number of people that are tough. They have injured, they have attacked.\u201d \u2014 immigration speech Thursday.\n\nTHE FACTS: He\u2019s given no evidence that people in the caravans are, by and large, dangerous, hardened criminals \u2014 after acknowledging at one point that there is no such proof.\n\nThe migrants in the caravans are mostly from Honduras, where it started, as well as El Salvador and Guatemala. Overall, they are poor, carrying the belongings that fit into a knapsack and fleeing gang violence or poverty.\n\nIt might be true there are some criminals mixed in with the throngs, given the sheer number of migrants. Trump did not substantiate his claim that members of the MS-13 gang, in particular, are among them. The Homeland Security Department issued a sheet stating that \u201cover 270 individuals along the caravan route have criminal histories, including known gang membership.\u201d But it did not specify how it had arrived at that number.\n\nSome migrants in one of the caravans clashed with Mexican police at the Mexico-Guatemala border, hurling stones and other objects as they tried to cross the international bridge. One migrant died; it\u2019s not clear how it happened. Caravan leaders said they had expelled a number of troublemakers from the procession, exhibiting some self-policing. Ultimately, most entered Guatemala \u2014 and later, Mexico \u2014 by illegally bypassing immigration checkpoints.\n\nThe caravan otherwise has been overwhelmingly peaceful, receiving applause and donated food from residents of the towns they pass. Mexican police have not tried again to stop them.\n\n___\n\nBIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP\n\nTRUMP: \u201cIt was always told to me that you needed a constitutional amendment. Guess what? You don\u2019t. ... Well, you can definitely do it with an act of Congress. But now they\u2019re saying I can do it just with an executive order.\u201d \u2014 interview published Tuesday with \u201cAxios on HBO.\u201d\n\nTHE FACTS: Scholars widely pan the idea that Trump could unilaterally change the rules on who is a citizen. It\u2019s highly questionable whether an act of Congress could do it, either, though it is conceivable that legislators could change the rules regarding children born in the U.S. of parents who are in the country illegally.\n\nPeter Schuck is perhaps the most prominent advocate of the idea that birthright citizenship is not conveyed by the Constitution to children of parents who are living illegally in the U.S. Even he says \u201cTrump clearly cannot act by\u201d executive order.\n\n\u201cI feel confident that no competent lawyer would advise him otherwise,\u201d he said by email Tuesday. \u201cThis is just pre-election politics and misrepresentation and should be sharply criticized as such.\u201d\n\nSchuck, of Yale, and colleague Rogers Smith of the University of Pennsylvania have argued since the mid-1980s that Congress can set the rules for providing citizenship to U.S.-born children of parents who came illegally.\n\nBut most scholars on the left and right share the view that it would take a constitutional amendment to deny automatic citizenship to children born in the U.S. to parents who are in the country illegally.\n\nJames Ho, a conservative Trump-appointed federal appeals court judge, wrote in the Green Bag legal journal in 2006 that birthright citizenship \u201cis protected no less for children of undocumented persons than for descendants of Mayflower passengers.\u201d\n\nStephen Yale-Loehr, a Cornell university immigration expert, said the case against Trump\u2019s authority is \u201cnot open and shut, but the better view is it would require a constitutional amendment.\u201d\n\nThe Constitution\u2019s citizenship clause was part of the post-Civil War amendments that enshrined the rights of African-Americans. The citizenship clause, in particular, was intended to overturn the Supreme Court\u2019s notorious Dred Scott decision of 1857 that held African-Americans were not citizens.\n\nThe Supreme Court has never ruled squarely about the clause\u2019s application to children of immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally. Trump did not make a distinction between legal and illegal status in his remarks. An 1898 Supreme Court decision held that the U.S.-born son of legal Chinese immigrants was a citizen under the 14th Amendment; a footnote in a 1982 decision suggests there should be no difference for children of foreign-born parents whether they are in the U.S. legally or illegally.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP: \u201cWe\u2019re the only country in the world where a person comes in, has a baby and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United States for 85 years with all of those benefits. It\u2019s ridiculous. It\u2019s ridiculous. And it has to end.\u201d \u2014 interview with \u201cAxios on HBO.\u201d\n\nTHE FACTS: That\u2019s wrong.\n\nThe U.S. is among about 30 countries where birthright citizenship \u2014 the principle of jus soli or \u201cright of the soil\u201d \u2014 is applied, according to the World Atlas and other sources. Most are in the Americas. Canada and Mexico are among them. Most other countries confer citizenship based on that of at least one parent \u2014 jus sanguinis, or \u201cright of blood\u201d \u2014 or have a modified form of birthright citizenship that may restrict automatic citizenship to children of parents who are on their territory legally.\n\nMore broadly, Trump\u2019s view that U.S.-born children of foreigners live a lifetime of taking \u201call those benefits\u201d ignores the taxes they pay, the work they do and their other contributions to society.\n\n___\n\n2016 ELECTION\n\nSARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, White House press secretary: Trump \u201cgot elected by an overwhelming majority of 63 million Americans who came out and supported him and wanted to see his policies enacted.\u201d \u2014 press briefing Monday.\n\nTHE FACTS: Trump did not earn a majority of votes in the 2016 election. He did win the Electoral College, allowing him to capture the presidency.\n\nTrump won nearly 63 million votes compared with more than 65 million for Democrat Hillary Clinton, who racked up lopsided victories in big states such as New York and California, according to election data compiled by The Associated Press. But she lost the presidency due to Trump\u2019s winning margin in the Electoral College, which came after he narrowly won less populous Midwestern states including Michigan and Wisconsin.\n\n___\n\nFLORIDA GOVERNOR\u2019S RACE\n\nTRUMP, on Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum: \u201cHis city, Tallahassee, is known as the most corrupt in Florida and one of the most corrupt in the nation.\u201d \u2014 Fox interview Monday.\n\nTHE FACTS: Trump is making an unsubstantiated assertion. Republicans including Gillum\u2019s opponent, Ron DeSantis, have made crime and corruption a talking point in the governor\u2019s race to knock down the Tallahassee mayor\u2019s political momentum, saying it\u2019s a crime-ridden city. But Tallahassee is not even in the top 25 when it comes to city per-capita crime rates in Florida. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement reports that Tallahassee had 5,765 crimes per 100,000 people in 2017. By comparison, the Florida city with the highest rate, Medley, had 28,004 crimes per 100,000 people.\n\nTrump, who stressed the principle of innocent until proven guilty when allegations shadowed Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, has also pointed to an ongoing investigation by the state\u2019s ethics commission into whether Gillum accepted gifts from lobbyists after a Tallahassee businessman and persistent critic of Gillum filed a complaint. Gillum has denied any wrongdoing in that case, or that he is a target in a separate ongoing FBI investigation into the city\u2019s government.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Colleen Long and Mark Sherman in Washington and Elliot Spagat in San Diego contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFind AP Fact Checks at http://apne.ws/2kbx8bd\n\nFollow @APFactCheck on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APFactCheck\n\nEDITOR\u2019S NOTE _ A look at the veracity of claims by political figures\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

This is the worst,\u201d City Commissioner Scott Maddox wrote after seeing the attack\u2019s aftermath. \u201cPlease pray.\u201d\n\nAbout a dozen people were inside Hot Yoga when a man with a black bag walked in around 5:30 p.m., the Tallahassee Democrat reported. The studio had advertised a Pilates certification class for the weekend.\n\nAmong the yoga students were Florida State University student Maura Binkley, 21, and 61-year-old Nancy Van Vessem, a local physician and a faculty member at Florida State. Both women were killed in the gunfire.\n\n\n\nScott Paul Beierle. (Leon County Sheriff's Office, via AP)\n\nPolice were still investigating a motive behind the shooting.\n\nBeierle had been arrested twice in the past six years by the university\u2019s police, according to criminal records. The first time was in 2012, when two women accused him of grabbing their buttocks on campus, the Democrat reported. He was detained again two years later for trespassing in a dining hall.\n\nAbout a month after the 2014 arrest, BuzzFeed News reported, Beierle posted a series of YouTube videos about his hatred of women under the name \u201cScott Carnifex.\u201d\n\nIn a video titled \u201cThe Rebirth of my Misogynism,\u201d he angrily recalled an incident in his eighth-grade home economics class, describing \u201cthe will that a group of females can generate when they target anyone, be it an adult male or a classmate.\u201d Other outrages in his life included women who gave him their phone numbers and later told him they had boyfriends. In one video he identified with Elliott Rodger, an avowed misogynist who killed six people at the University of California at Santa Barbara earlier that year.\n\nIn other videos Beierle spewed racism, according to the Associated Press. He denigrated black women as \u201cdisgusting\u201d and suggested planting land mines to stop people trying to cross the U.S.-Mexican border, AP said.\n\nCharges were dismissed for both of Beierle\u2019s university arrests, but he agreed to a plea deal after a final arrest by Tallahassee police in 2016. According to a police report, he was living in an off-campus apartment in his late 30s \u2014 noticeably older than the other residents \u2014 and one day offered to put lotion on a 19-year-old sunbathing by the pool. When the woman declined, she told police, Beierle \u201cslapped her butt, and grabbed it and then shook it.\u201d\n\nOn Friday evening, survivors said Beierle kept walking in and out of the yoga studio as class began, according to Melissa Hutchinson, who works at a restaurant below Hot Yoga and later cleaned a survivor\u2019s blood off the kitchen floor.\n\n\u201cThey said he just kept coming in and out the doors and was a little sketchy,\u201d Hutchinson told the Democrat. \u201cBut nobody said anything.\u201d\n\n[\u2018They showed his photo, and my stomach just dropped\u2019: Neighbors recall synagogue massacre suspect as a loner]\n\nThe man eventually stopped in the studio\u2019s doorway, pulled a gun from the bag and loaded it in front of the students.

Combs said she embraced a woman who couldn\u2019t stop hyperventilating.\n\nThen \u201cI see this kid in a white T-shirt with blood coming out of his forehead,\u201d Combs said. The person in the T-shirt had been pistol-whipped while trying to fight off the gunman, police later said.\n\nAnother customer at the bar, Kristin Jacobs, was among several who praised the survivor\u2019s actions. \u201cI am alive because one guy in a yoga class in his bare feet ran at a shooter,\u201d she told the Democrat.\n\n[A gunman opens fire in your building. What do you do?]\n\nPolice said the first officers arrived about three minutes after the 911 call, at 5:40 p.m. Seven people had been shot inside the studio, including Beierle, who appeared to have killed himself, police said.\n\nFour of the wounded were expected to survive, including one whom the Democrat reported had been shot nine times.\n\nBinkley and Van Vessem died of their wounds.\n\nA doctor of internal medicine and director for Capital Health Plan, Van Vessem also worked at Florida State.

Cora said if that happens, it offers what he called a \u201chuge platform.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know what it represents, and I think I\u2019ve done a good job so far representing my country and Latinos, and if as an organization we decided to go, I\u2019ll use this platform the right way,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to embarrass the organization, or my country or myself.\u201d\n\nWhen asked by The Associated Press to specify what he meant by \u201cthe right way,\u201d Cora grinned and only said, \u201cYou\u2019ll have to wait and see.\u201d\n\nBefore meeting with reporters, Cora got on stage and addressed the crowd, saying the win wouldn\u2019t have been possible without team members.\n\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s talking about Alex, about the coaches, about the owners...but what these guys do every day is worthy of admiration,\u201d he said, adding that he heard stories about Puerto Ricans staying up until 4 a.m. to watch games.\n\n\u201cAnd that excited me because I would think, I\u2019m not doing anything. Thank you for being here. Thank you for supporting us,\u201d he said.\n\nFans dressed in red and blue gushed about Cora\u2019s visit.\n\n\u201cHe put us on the map,\u201d said 26-year-old Miguel Martinez, who was slow dancing to salsa with his girlfriend as they waited for Cora. \u201cMy eyes filled with tears when he won the championship because this is something historic.\u201d\n\nSome fans had driven more than an hour to receive the manager and praised how he helped Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria hit more than a year ago amid a 12-year recession.\n\nWhen 43-year-old Cora negotiated his contract last October, he asked his team to help with relief efforts, and they eagerly pitched in.\n\n\u201cDespite everything that has happened, we have a bit of happiness on the side,\u201d said Red Sox fan Arleen Cruz, who drove to Caguas with her husband from the southern town of Humacao to receive the players.\n\nThe two have been Red Sox fans since 1972.\n\n\u201cPuerto Rico\u2019s name couldn\u2019t be held up higher,\u201d said Cruz\u2019s husband, Ramon Reyes, who was clad in a Red Sox hat, T-shirt and towel slung over his shoulder.\n\nThey mingled with other fans stopping to buy food, beer and merchandise from roadside vendors as the smell of fried empanadillas and other local specialties wafted through the air.\n\nRonald Lopez-Cepero and his wife, both from Caguas, had already bought T-shirts last week that read \u201cPROUD for Puerto Rico.\u201d He recalled how he had about a dozen baseball cards featuring Cora and his older brother, Joey, a former big-league infielder, which both of them signed.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a tremendous person,\u201d said the lifelong fan. \u201cHe\u2019s very humble and helpful.\u201d\n\nCora, who spent 14 years in the majors and batted .243 as an infielder with six teams, steered the Red Sox to a team-record 108 wins in the regular season before Boston topped the 100-win Yankees and Astros in the playoffs.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Hamad I Mohammed/Reuters)\n\nMilitary officials are expressing alarm that a shrinking U.S. military presence in the Middle East has undermined their ability to respond to Iranian threats just as the Trump administration\u2019s imposition of oil sanctions increases the potential for confrontation.\n\nConcern about the Pentagon\u2019s decision to move ships, combat aircraft and missile defense systems out of the region has intensified in the run-up to Monday\u2019s deadline for reimposing energy sanctions on Iran, the White House\u2019s latest move to pressure Iran and curtail its support for armed proxy groups.\n\nAlthough officials don\u2019t think Iran is capable of sustaining a prolonged large-scale attack on U.S. forces in the region, they are worried that it could lash out by employing its robust arsenal of ballistic missiles or using mines to shut down waterways crucial to global commerce.\n\n[Iran braces for oil sanctions after currency crash, protests]\n\nThe U.S. footprint in the region has shrunk as the Pentagon, under President Trump\u2019s strategy for reorienting national security priorities, seeks to direct the military toward competition with China and Russia rather than the insurgent groups that have been the focus of the post-9/11 period.\n\nThe Pentagon is racing to match its global posture toward what Defense Secretary Jim Mattis calls \u201cgreat power competition,\u201d even as the White House has elevated a separate goal of checking Iran\u2019s influence and activities across the Middle East.\n\nIt is the campaign to contain Iran \u2014 including Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from his predecessor\u2019s nuclear deal and announce an effort to drive Iranian forces out of Syria \u2014 that some military officials think has increased the likelihood of confrontation. Multiple officials said that U.S. Central Command, which oversees operations in the Middle East, has requested additional resources.\n\nThe U.S. military has not had an aircraft carrier in the region since March. It has also removed a large share of its Patriot missile batteries along with certain combat aircraft such as the advanced F-22 Raptor, according to military officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss force allocation.\n\nThat shift has occurred as Iran had made public threats to close the Strait of Hormuz. Officials think it would require several months to get ready for war with Iran, much longer than it would take Iran to damage global commerce.\n\nLt Col. Earl Brown, a Centcom spokesman, said the command had the forces it needed to defeat the Islamic State, assist Afghan forces to battle the Taliban and conduct other missions. \u201cWhile we are not going to discuss the movement of specific forces into and out of the region, the U.S. has repeatedly demonstrated the ability to rapidly deploy and mass forces whenever and wherever they are needed in a time of crisis,\u201d he said.\n\nA primary concern for some officials is the military\u2019s ability to respond in the Strait of Hormuz, the maritime choke point that Iran has threatened to shut down if provoked.\n\n\u201cNow you\u2019re squeezing them economically and diplomatically, and it\u2019s uncertain what Iran\u2019s ultimate reaction will be,\u201d one official said.\n\n[Foiled Paris bomb plot raises fears that Iran is planning attacks in Europe]\n\nSince the USS Theodore Roosevelt headed to the Pacific in the spring, there has been no U.S. carrier group in the Middle East, the longest period in years in which there has not been at least one in the region. Officials point out that it\u2019s not just the deterrent power of the carrier but the other ships, aircraft and assets it brings with it.\n\nAlthough Gen. Joseph Votel, the Centcom commander, declined to discuss shortfalls in the region, he said he supported the realignment toward China and Russia. Speaking during a visit last week to the USS Essex, an amphibious assault ship in the Persian Gulf, he said: \u201cWould I love to have a carrier? Absolutely. No doubt about it. But I understand why we don\u2019t, and I\u2019m very grateful for vessels like the Essex right now.\u201d\n\nWhile naval officials said there are four destroyers in the region, one typically is tasked with addressing the threat from Houthi rebels in Yemen in the area around the Bab al-Mandeb, on the other side of the Arabian Peninsula. Often another will be in port for maintenance.\n\nIran, meanwhile, has at least 1,000 fast boats \u2014 the small, armed vessels that Tehran has regularly used to harass U.S. ships \u2014 and the capability to lay thousands of mines in waters off its coast. Officials estimate that Iran could position 1,000 mines in less than a week. It would take a relatively small number of mines to close the strait or make it difficult to transit.\n\nAlthough its small fleet of Russian-made Kilo-class submarines, in addition to Chinese mini-subs, does not approach the sophistication of the U.S. undersea capability, officials said, the vessels could impede commerce if stationed in the Strait of Hormuz.\n\nVice Adm. Scott Stearney, who heads U.S. naval forces in the Middle East, said the evolving U.S. naval posture reflected the Pentagon\u2019s new, more fluid and unpredictable way of deploying forces.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no fixed positions anywhere on the globe where we anchor anything,\u201d he told reporters last month. He noted that the last carrier deployment was at a moment of heightened activity in the campaign against the Islamic State. \u201cThat was a different time, that was a different context, different conditions,\u201d he said.\n\nAt the Pentagon, senior officials including Mattis and Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, have identified Iran and North Korea as important challenges but ones that do not rise to the level of China\u2019s rapid advance in military technology and Russia\u2019s moves to assert itself globally.\n\nCol. Patrick Ryder, a Joint Chiefs spokesman, said the military\u2019s alliances and its ability to \u201csurge forces\u201d into the region would allow it to deter and respond to Iran.\n\nBut concern continues to grow as well about Iran\u2019s missile capability. While U.S. officials have raised questions about Iran\u2019s ability to strike intended targets, a recent ballistic missile attack on militants in Syria, which was launched from Iran and came within about three miles of American troops, demonstrated its improved aim.\n\nAfter the strike, pro-Iranian forces said the attack sent a message to adversaries in the region about Iran\u2019s missile might. The distance flown by those missiles \u2014 more than 300 miles \u2014 demonstrated that U.S. bases in Qatar, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates are within reach.\n\nNeither do officials feel confident in their ability to repel Iran\u2019s ballistic missiles, estimated at about 2,000. This year, the Pentagon removed four Patriot missile batteries from the region. It takes several air defense projectiles to shoot down one incoming missile.\n\nTo counter the mine threat, the United States has minesweepers and specialized helicopters based in Bahrain, but their ability to secure mined waterways could be slowed by Iranian missiles and boats.\n\nMara Karlin, a former senior Pentagon official who is an associate professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, said Trump\u2019s decision to pull out of the nuclear deal had increased the risk of a clash. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to blow up the JCPOA, the prospects for conflict are higher, period,\u201d she said, using shorthand for the agreement.\n\nBut Karlin said it was time to make adjustments to the heavy presence the Pentagon maintained in the region during the height of counterinsurgency operations, given the cost to the ability to confront enhanced competition from Beijing and Moscow.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a difficult adjustment and it does require some really hard discussions,\u201d she said.", "President Trump at a campaign rally on Friday in Huntington, W.Va.

Democrats let him stay\u201d \u2014 though the killer came to the United States during the presidency of George W. Bush.\n\nOn Tuesday, voters will make a decision in what is the purest midterm referendum on a sitting president in modern times:\n\nWill we take a step, even a small one, back from the ugliness and the race-baiting that has engulfed our country?\n\nOr will we affirm that we are really the intolerant and frightened people Donald Trump has made us out to be?\n\nIf we choose the latter, 2018 will in some ways be more difficult to take than 2016.

Right now the region is on pace to add only about 170,000 new units by then, and the shortage threatens to exacerbate inequality.\n\n\u201cWhether Amazon comes or not, we have a challenge there,\u201d said Peter Tatian, of the Urban Institute. \u201cThe economic growth that has been going on has been benefiting some people and causing problems for others.\u201d\n\nAmazon says it plans to make $5 billion in capital investments alone in the city it chooses and that its headquarters injected an additional $38 billion into the local economy in Seattle, generating an additional $1.40 for every dollar the company spent. But its growth has led to fissures between the company and Seattle.\n\nHomelessness in the city has escalated, and Amazon vowed to cancel some of its expansion plans if the city passed a new tax on big businesses to raise money to address the problem.\n\nLittle transparency from jurisdictions\n\nBezos and the company have made several recent announcements that could soften Amazon\u2019s public image as it moves to open HQ2.\n\nNow the world\u2019s wealthiest person, Bezos announced in September that he would donate $2 billion of his own money to support groups battling homelessness in the United States and create a network of preschools in underserved communities.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a coincidence that one of those issues was homelessness,\u201d said Joe Parilla, a Brookings Institution fellow. \u201cI think you can draw a pretty clear link between the debate that is unfolding in a lot of these tech hubs and how this gives a little bit of cover to Amazon as it is investing in these hot markets.\u201d\n\nIn October \u2014 after bearing months of criticism from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) over its treatment of workers \u2014 Amazon announced it would raise its minimum wage for all employees to $15 per hour.\n\nBut the company\u2019s request for secrecy has kept a potentially thorny discussion, about how much states and cities should be willing to offer the company for its jobs, in the background.\n\nFew of the public subsidies being offered to Amazon from states, cities and counties for the project have been made public, which some analysts say could result in blowback from taxpayers if they are announced as fait accompli. Maryland has offered an incentive package worth an estimated $8.5 billion, while the Newark subsidies are estimated at $7 billion. On Wednesday, a judge in Allegheny County, Pa., ordered the release of Pittsburgh\u2019s proposal after a legal fight with a local television station. The decision is expected to be appealed.\n\n\u201cI would question why cities weren\u2019t more forthcoming [with their proposals], and I suspect it\u2019s because there would have been some pushback to what the cities were offering,\u201d said Heidi Learner, chief economist for the advisory firm Savills Studley. \u201cFrom the public\u2019s perspective the question is what is the city hiding or why shouldn\u2019t they share how [those proposals] would actually lead to more tax revenue down the line?\u201d\n\nAfter Amazon initially pressed for more information, some leaders were expecting to hear the list of finalists narrowed down publicly, to give economic development teams from the eliminated cities a chance to move on.\n\n\u201cI think the process got away from them a little bit. They probably were planning for some kind of down-selection and changed their position on that,\u201d said Jason Miller, chief executive of the Greater Washington Partnership, a business group.\n\nIn addition to tax breaks, some cities have offered to build or expand roads, transit, data networks or airports if Amazon arrives. Parilla, of Brookings, said it\u2019s preferable to \u201cmaximize the broader benefit of these investments as much as possible.\u201d\n\nHe also doesn\u2019t think it makes sense for Amazon, an $816 billion company, to press a city or state for an enormous subsidy package that could cut into money for other services.\n\n\u201cMy sense is that Amazon doesn\u2019t want to repeat some of the antagonism in Seattle,\u201d Parilla said. \u201cIt\u2019s not great for the brand to be viewed as oblivious to the existing economic and racial inequities in the city where it\u2019s going to invest.\u201d\n\nThe ultimate decision is likely to rest with Bezos. He has a history of showing independence in such matters, such as when he needed a new headquarters for The Washington Post shortly after he purchased it.\n\nThe preferred choice among Post executives and consultants was a planned office building near Union Station, which they touted to Bezos during a tour of potential locations.\n\nThat site was the favorite \u2014 until Bezos weighed in, and chose a downtown building.\n\nNow that Bezos is nearing a decision on the far more consequential HQ2 search, Washington area leaders are hoping he does not throw another curveball.", "Ukraine President Petro Poroshenko, left, talks to members of the media following his meeting with Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I, right, at the patriarchate in Istanbul, Saturday, Nov. 3, 2018.

Forcing a university to be color blind would not just tie its hands when it comes to deciding which applicants to accept, it would also place a muzzle on high-achieving young people of color who hope to attend.\n\nHow can we expect applicants to share who they are and what has shaped them if we force them not to mention what people often notice first about them? And if they are allowed to mention that, then how can the school truly eliminate race-conscious admissions?\n\n[What gives you an edge in Harvard admissions? Check the trial evidence.]\n\nThe case \u2014 which saw closing arguments in a Boston courtroom on Friday \u2014 isn\u2019t just about checking a box. Edward Blum, the president of Students for Fair Admissions, the organization that launched the suit on behalf of a group of Asian American students, has said: \u201cThe cornerstone mission of this organization is to eliminate the use of race and ethnicity in college admissions. Period.\u201d\n\nBut what would that look like in reality? How would that work when it comes to listing student activities? Would applicants not be allowed to mention they were president of the Latino student union, and if they did, would that be given no weight? If they wrote an essay about growing up as a black child adopted by an Asian family, explaining how they were fluent in Chinese before kindergarten, would that have to be disregarded?\n\nEarlier this year, I requested a copy of my application from Stanford University in the hopes of getting a glimpse at notes scribbled on it by the people who decided to admit me.\n\nI recognize that I likely benefited from affirmative action. I had a high GPA, but it was not the highest possible. I had a strong SAT score for my school, which was in a high-poverty, high-crime area, but it was not the perfect 1600 that was common at Stanford. The application I submitted had the word \u201cSample\u201d stamped on the front of it. I was mortified about that at the time and included a Post-it note apologizing and explaining that it was the only application for the university in my guidance counselor\u2019s office. She hadn\u2019t expected anyone to apply to any top-tier schools.\n\nA copy of my application arrived a few weeks after I put in the request. To my disappointment, none of the pages contained notes or anything that could provide insight into the internal admissions process. But the pages did show my handwritten answers to the questions on the application. None asked directly about race or ethnicity, but my responses revealed this: My Mexican American roots were inextricable from who I was at that moment.\n\nThe first question asked me to address which activity or interest was the most meaningful to me and why.\n\nMy answer: \u201c \u2018Tu estas loca en la cabeza,\u2019 my grandmother told me even before I was old enough to know what crazy was. I\u2019m crazy for taking on a position in which sleep is a rarity and the stress level is high. I\u2019m crazy for putting in 15-hour work days to catch an interview and convert it into news. I\u2019m crazy for giving the journalism department everything I have. But, in truth, the department gave me more than I could ever give it.\u201d (Apparently, my life hasn\u2019t changed much since high school.)\n\nI agree that it is not fair that some students who work hard and contribute to their community won\u2019t get accepted to every school to which they apply. I sympathize with them and their parents. But it is also not fair that some students won\u2019t get a chance to attend college \u2014 any college \u2014 because of persistent societal inequities.\n\n[Of course race should matter in college admissions \u2014 as explained by students of color at Harvard trial]\n\nAffirmative action is not about discrimination. It is about allowing colleges and universities to gauge potential when circumstances haven\u2019t allowed a young person to reach their potential yet. It\u2019s about allowing them to consider the entirety of an applicant, in all their inextricable qualities.\n\nI spoke to Madison Trice several days after she testified. The 19-year-old said when she graduates from Harvard, she hopes to work for the Foreign Service and then settle down in the District because the city \u201cplayed a really important role in who I am.\u201d\n\nBy the time she was 16, persistent bullying had changed how she interacted with people. She constantly apologized, to the point that she prefaced questions with the word \u201csorry.\u201d She also spoke with a higher pitch than normal in an effort to sound friendlier.\n\nIn her essay, which I asked her to send me, she discusses the semester she spent at the School for Ethics and Global Leadership in Northwest Washington. She describes a night she and her classmates spent under the Capitol, talking about their past.\n\nFrom her essay:\n\n\u201cAfter we shared our stories, there was silence save for a few whispered words, and one sentence that I haven\u2019t forgotten: \u2018I hope you know that you don\u2019t have to change yourself.\u2019 Those words were the beginning of a journey toward finding my self-worth. . . . Now, I don\u2019t change my voice. I substitute more beautiful words for apologies because I won\u2019t diminish myself. I\u2019m pursuing my dreams unabashedly because I believe I deserve them. Although my journey to loving myself is one of the hardest ones I\u2019ve undertaken, I won\u2019t look back.\u201d\n\nThat is someone we should want at a university where many of our leaders are shaped.\n\nAs for the 16-year-old girl who uttered the words of encouragement that helped Trice realize her worth? She grew up in the D.C. area and is also African American.

Their leaders professed to be nonviolent lovers of the prophet Muhammad, but they exhorted angry crowds to block highways, set fires and throw stones. Some called for a military mutiny and the deaths of the justices who on Wednesday overturned the blasphemy conviction of Asia Bibi after she spent nine years in prison.\n\nThe Pakistani government paid a high price for achieving that calm, by conceding to most of the protesters\u2019 demands after hours of negotiations Friday.\n\nThe signed deal, made public immediately, allowed the anti-blasphemy groups to appeal the Supreme Court ruling. It also agreed that Bibi, whom the protesters want dead, will not be allowed to leave the country.\n\nWhile many Pakistanis expressed relief that relative calm had returned after days of unrest, the stunning capitulation drew widespread condemnation Saturday. Many critics called it a dangerous surrender to the forces of religious extremism and hatred against minorities, who are often targeted on trumped-up charges of blasphemy against Islam.\n\nBibi, 47, a peasant worker, was convicted after an argument with Muslim co-workers in a field. The high court ruled that the evidence against her was flimsy and contradictory, but it did not criticize or question the strict blasphemy laws or the mandatory death sentence for those convicted.\n\nFaisal Siddiqi, a lawyer writing in the Dawn newspaper, said the court ruling had set the tone \u201cfor a much larger, existential issue facing the country: whether Pakistan is actually becoming a theocratic state in which vigilantism prevails,\u201d or whether the ruling is a \u201cwatershed moment\u201d that will allow the Muslim-majority country to move ahead as a \u201cmodern constitutional state.\u201d\n\nMany people had praised Pakistan\u2019s new prime minister, Imran Khan, after he gave a stern warning to the protesters in a televised speech Wednesday.\n\nKhan called their aggressive behavior and threats \u201cdeplorable,\u201d said they were not acting \u201cin service to Islam,\u201d and asked them not to clash with the laws of a democratic state.\n\nBut by Saturday, with Khan away on a visit to China, critics expressed disappointment that his resolve had crumbled and said this would further embolden a radical religious movement that has drawn support from millions of mainstream Sunni Muslims.\n\nSome warned that Bibi\u2019s life is not safe in Pakistan, where people accused of blasphemy are often lynched. Her lawyer fled the country Saturday, saying he had received death threats. The justices who freed Bibi have had their lives threatened, so another high court panel that hears the protesters\u2019 appeal may also feel in danger.\n\n\u201cThe boundaries of hate have continued to expand in Pakistan without any pushback from the state or society,\u201d Babar Sattar, a lawyer in Islamabad, wrote in the News International newspaper on Saturday. \u201cClerics see this verdict as the state interfering in their exclusive domain.\u201d\n\nConstable reported from Islamabad.\n\nRead more:\n\nChristians come under threat in Pakistan\n\nOpinion: Who\u2019s afraid of Imran Khan?

(Ali Mohammedi/Bloomberg News)\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s decision in May to leave the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) and reimpose sanctions against Iran produced resentment and resistance from the deal\u2019s other supporters.\n\nOn Friday, Trump announced that he will follow through with reimposing stringent sanctions on financial deals with Iran and purchases of Iranian oil, petrochemicals and petroleum products. These sanctions policies include controversial \u201csecondary sanctions\u201d \u2014 provisions that seek to coerce companies in other countries to comply with U.S. sanctions policies.\n\nWhat happens now? Will these aggressive policies, which start Monday, lead to greater conflict or cooperation with U.S. sanctioning efforts?\n\nThe European Union, China and Russia have all agreed to continue supporting the JCPOA deal by assisting Iran in circumventing U.S. sanctions. For example, Russia struck a deal to keep Iranian oil exports flowing, and the E.U. is creating \u201cspecial purpose vehicles\u201d (SPVs) to allow Iran to do business outside the reach of U.S. financial sanctions.\n\nStates commonly mobilize to undercut sanctions they oppose. What\u2019s different this time is how blatantly many governments are challenging U.S. sanctions \u2014 and how hard the United States may be willing to strike back.\n\nThe full sanctions against Iran\n\nThe United States on May 8 announced its intention to withdrawal from JCPOA and reimpose sanctions against Iran \u2014 establishing two waiver periods before the sanctions would fully go into effect Nov. 5. In August, the Trump administration reinstated restrictions on Iran\u2019s ability to obtain U.S. dollars and precious metals, along with export sanctions on auto/aerospace products and services.\n\n[President Trump pulled the U.S. out of the Iran deal. Here\u2019s what you need to know.]\n\nThis latest announcement reimposes harsh sanctions designed to prevent Iran from exporting fossil fuels and further isolate its financial sector that had been in effect before the JCPOA deal. The United States has significant leverage over foreign financial institutions that depend upon access to the U.S. financial system to carry out international transactions. Many governments sought and received waivers to continue purchasing fossil fuels from Iran during the 180-day waiver period. The Trump administration announced that only eight countries \u2014 and not the E.U. \u2014 would continue to receive that waiver after Nov. 4.\n\nSanctions don\u2019t work well when other countries go around them\n\nSanctions-busting by foreign firms is one of the leading reasons U.S. sanctions policies fail, a problem U.S. policymakers are trying to address by employing secondary sanctions. The Treasury Department has also become increasingly active in using its Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN) list to target and economically isolate Iranian entities.\n\n[E.U. countries want to save the Iran nuclear deal. Don\u2019t expect cooperation on U.S. sanctions.]\n\nBeing SDN-designated is more than a modern-day Scarlet Letter \u2014 it can be an economic death sentence for parties relying on international trade or transactions. The U.S. secondary sanctions and aggressive use of the SDN list against Iran will undoubtedly damage many foreign companies\u2019 bottom lines \u2014 forcing them to pay a price for a U.S. policy their governments oppose. And economies beyond Iran will also suffer.\n\nIn the absence of broad cooperation from foreign governments, the United States will rely heavily on SDN/secondary sanctions to dissuade foreign companies from undercutting its sanctions against Iran. In the past, such policies have provoked significant political backlash from foreign governments. For example, Canada, Mexico and E.U. members strongly resisted U.S. efforts at using secondary sanctions against Cuba during the 1990s. In the early 1980s, President Ronald Reagan\u2019s efforts to target companies that supported a new gas pipeline from the Soviet Union to Europe prompted adamant opposition from a number of NATO allies.\n\nSo it\u2019s not surprising that the E.U. also adopted a blocking statute in August, requiring E.U. companies not to comply with U.S. secondary sanctions. The E.U. also announced the creation of SPVs to facilitate continued trade with Iran by providing channels for financial transactions that are firewalled from the U.S. financial system. The E.U.-backed SPVs would serve as third parties in transactions with Iran \u2014 operating outside of the international banking system, and shielding the transactions of the companies that use them. The United States reacted angrily to this announcement.\n\nFor many large companies such as Total, Volvo and Deutsche Telekom, the risks associated with U.S. sanctions persuaded them to cease doing business in Iran. Even firms operating in sectors not subject to U.S. sanctions, such as health care, are ending operations for fear of running afoul of sanctions provisions and the difficulties associated with financing transactions. For risk-accepting firms that are not dependent upon doing business with the United States, the SPVs could provide the financial means to continue trading with Iran. But there\u2019s at least one hitch \u2014 these SPVs are not yet operational.\n\nAll eyes will be on Europe to see how the new sanctions play out\n\nThe Trump administration is likely to face two big questions:\n\nIs the United States willing to damage its political relationships with JCPOA supporters to convince them to cooperate with the tighter U.S. sanctions?\n\nHow much are the E.U., China and Russia, in particular, are willing to invest \u2014 financially and politically \u2014 to preserve their independence from U.S. sanctions?\n\nActive E.U. support for sanctions-busting will be a blow, because the Trump administration expects European governments and companies to fall in line \u2014 and the E.U. had closely cooperated with the United States in sanctioning Iran during the Obama administration. In August, Trump laid down a clear Twitter threat: \u201cAnyone doing business with Iran will NOT be doing business with the United States.\u201d Notably, Italy was the only E.U. member to receive a sanctions waiver \u2014 creating a clear fault line for future conflict.\n\nIf European countries actively evade U.S. sanctions against Iran, it would exacerbate already-strained relations between the United States and Europe in bodies such as NATO. The success of initiatives such as the SPVs could also encourage European countries to work more closely with Russia and China to find ways of buffering themselves from U.S. economic coercion in the future.\n\nMany large corporations may opt to stop doing business with Iran, given the threat of U.S. punitive measures. Small- and medium-size enterprises that are less dependent upon doing business with the United States can better risk trading with Iran, but may need their governments to support those efforts and protect them from retaliation. Though there is significant uncertainty related to how much collateral damage the U.S. sanctions will produce, it\u2019s safe to say, that they will, by design, harm a lot more parties than just Iran.\n\nBryan R.

Kim\u2019s regime, however, has always demanded a step-by-step process of denuclearization that would include lifting U.S. sanctions along the way.\n\nIn the past month, Pyongyang has stepped up its calls for sanctions relief. The statement released late Friday by its Foreign Ministry is the latest indication that negotiations over the nuclear program have hit an impasse.\n\nThe issue of sanctions has also created a rift between Seoul and Washington.\n\nSouth Korea has backed the North\u2019s call for sanctions relief and is keen to get moving on an ambitious program of economic development and cooperation, including building road and rail links across the countries\u2019 heavily militarized frontier.\n\n[North Korea appears to raise its demands]\n\nThe North Korean Foreign Ministry warned that unless sanctions were lifted and Washington stopped behaving \u201carrogantly,\u201d North Korea could reinstate \u201cpyongjin\u201d \u2014 its policy of simultaneously developing its nuclear weapons program alongside seeking economic development.\n\nIn April, Kim declared that the country\u2019s nuclear weapons program was sufficiently advanced and that \u201cpyongjin\u201d would be replaced by a focus on improving the economy.

In this well-researched book, Martin Sandler focuses on the Apollo 8 spaceflight of December 1968, in which three astronauts attempted to go beyond the Earth\u2019s orbit to orbit the moon. Along with historical background, Sandler also gives a sense of what it was like to be on that mission, in the capsule, for more than six days. For starters, the flight simulators didn\u2019t quite prepare them for liftoff on the Saturn V rocket.

(Photo by Michael Robinson Chavez/The Washington Post)\n\nIn the headlong plunge toward the midterms, what aren\u2019t folks paying attention to? The universe of potential answers is infinite, from \u201cgun control\u201d to \u201cthe endoplasmic reticulum,\u201d but data from Google can help narrow it down.\n\nA map of Google searches for political issues in every county in the United States feels like a periscope. It pokes above the political rhetoric and media coverage and peers straight into the nation\u2019s subconscious.\n\n[A quick guide to the biggest midterm storylines]\n\nCrises wash over the country. Attention rises and ebbs. Issues that seemed decisive early in the year get zero traction in November. In February, the month 17 people were murdered at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High in Parkland, Fla., most of the nation searched for terms related to gun control. By October, the issue had fallen off the map.\n\n\n\n(Andrew Van Dam/Washington, D.C.)\n\nSome things, of course, remain constant. When Google provided us with search data for more than a hundred politics-related issues, there was one obvious pattern. In almost every county in almost every month for the past year, health care topped the charts. Medicare and Medicaid were perennially popular, as was mental health.\n\n\n\n(Andrew Van Dam/Washington, D.C.)\n\nImmigration, too, remained popular. These maps are monthly and end in October, but there\u2019s evidence that in the closing days before the election, political rhetoric is breaking through. It now rivals health care at the forefront of the nation\u2019s consciousness.\n\n[Video: How The Post is preparing to cover the midterms on election night]\n\nTo understand which topics had fallen off our radar, we chose nine issues that had strong political ties and heavy search interest. We tried to pick issues of relevance across the political spectrum. It required a few judgment calls. Issues can overlap, and each of our chosen topics consisted of dozens or even hundreds of search terms that a Google algorithm has determined to be related. The algorithm combines searches in all languages.\n\nWhen we removed health care from the mix, a few geographic patterns emerged. Immigration was easily the most popular non-health issue, especially in urban areas.\n\n\n\n(Andrew Van Dam/Washington, D.C.)\n\nTo better understand the geographic distribution, we sized circles by population instead of coloring in counties. To understand why, let\u2019s consider searches for the Confederacy.\n\nAt first glance, the results appeared random. Searches for Confederate issues had little relation to the borders of the Confederate States of America. It\u2019s a weird map.\n\n\n\n(Andrew Van Dam/Washington, D.C.)\n\nThen, we represented counties by circles sized by population. We would have preferred search volume, but Google couldn\u2019t provide that data. We found that the divide wasn\u2019t between the North and the South, but between populous urban areas and less-populous rural ones. The tiny rural dots become harder to see, but the trend becomes apparent.\n\nSearches for the Confederacy topped the list not just in the Deep South, but also in rural parts of states such as Colorado, Michigan and New Hampshire. In urban areas such as Detroit and Denver, however, those searches didn\u2019t crack the top four.\n\nThe map illustrates a trend chronicled by the Post\u2019s Frances Stead Sellers, who wrote in October that the Confederate battle flag had become a nationwide symbol of white grievance.\n\nHere, we show April 2018 \u2014 when searches peaked during the controversy over Confederate monuments. October\u2019s search pattern is similar, but interest has waned.\n\n\n\n(Andrew Van Dam/Washington, D.C.)\n\nOther issues with higher search traction in rural communities since September include: agricultural subsidies, the Dakota Access pipeline, fracking, voting age, electoral fraud and flag desecration. Issues with high search traction in the most-populated fifth of counties included: the Patriot Act, free trade, political corruption, the Paris climate agreement, safe spaces and vaccine controversies.\n\nLike gun control, tariffs captivated the nation early in the year -- especially in areas that depended on agriculture or international trade. But by October, only a handful of rural counties were still paying attention to the issue.\n\n\n\n(Andrew Van Dam/Washington, D.C.)\n\nInterest in the minimum wage peaked in January when minimum-wage hikes took effect in scores of cities and states. It remains high.\n\n\n\n(Andrew Van Dam/Washington, D.C.)\n\nWhen the pattern is different, it\u2019s often for issues that tend to tumble around in the nation\u2019s consciousness whether or not there\u2019s a specific news story to thrust them into the nation\u2019s headlines. One example is abortion, which was a high-ranked issue in the South and Midwest earlier in the year, but has now spread throughout the country.\n\n\n\n(Andrew Van Dam/Washington, D.C.)\n\nWe\u2019re taking the long-term view here. You can find real-time maps, including many that compare politicians head to head, at Google\u2019s midterms site. Click on specific states for details. Here\u2019s Texas.\n\nGoogle search data comes with many limitations. We can overcome some of them and compare numbers nationwide by isolating issues that ranked highest in each county. There\u2019s one significant distortion from population density: Obscure topics don\u2019t get enough search traffic in less-populated counties, so it\u2019s more likely data won\u2019t be available for rural areas. But where ranks are available, a Google representative said, they\u2019ll be consistent.\n\nThis story and its headline have been updated.", "When the United States levies sanctions against most countries, it rarely announces them in advance. Except when it comes to Iran.\n\nThe State Department and the White House have been sending out a series of warnings about the looming sanctions against Iran, none more ominous than President Trump\u2019s cinematic tweet Friday declaring \u201cSANCTIONS ARE COMING.\u201d\n\nFor more than a week, the State Department has been tweeting out red-letter alerts that sanctions on Iran will be back in full force on Monday.\n\nThe presentation is in countdown form, each day featuring one of 12 requirements set by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for Iran to act \u201clike a normal state.\u201d\n\nThe coming sanctions and the social media offensive are the centerpiece of the administration\u2019s maximum-pressure campaign on Iran after the U.S. withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal. Sunday marks the end to a 180-day grace period for countries and companies doing business with Iranian banks, oil and shipping companies. Hundreds of people and groups that got sanctions relief under the deal will be relisted. Anyone who assists their trade can be sanctioned, too.\n\nThe administration aims to squeeze Iran\u2019s already-precarious economy, particularly by denying it the oil revenue that makes up 80 percent of the government\u2019s tax income. U.S. officials are optimistic that the financial starvation diet will eventually force Iran to stop supporting militant groups in Syria, Yemen and Syria, and to renegotiate the nuclear deal. It\u2019s a strategy opposed by all but a handful of countries in the world.\n\nThe reimposed sanctions represent the latest chapter in almost four decades of hostility between the United States and Iran. In a coincidence of timing, Sunday is the anniversary of the storming of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979 when Iranian students took 60 U.S. diplomats and citizens hostage.\n\nBut it\u2019s unclear if what Pompeo calls the \u201claser-focused approach\u201d will succeed in getting Iran to bend to Washington\u2019s will. Many of the negative effects have already happened.\n\nMultinational companies that dipped into the Iranian market after the nuclear deal have departed in recent months. The Iranian rial has collapsed since the U.S. withdrawal, driven to a historic low against the dollar. Iran\u2019s oil exports have slumped from about 2.5 million barrels a day to below 1.5 million. The International Monetary Fund predicts the economy will shrink by 3.6 percent this year.\n\n\u201cIn some ways the worst is already over,\u201d said Barbara Slavin, director of the\n\nFuture of Iran Initiative at the Atlantic Council. \u201cIran is now ready to hunker down and wait out the Trump administration on the assumption it is going to be one-term administration.\u201d\n\n[A foiled assassination attempt in Denmark may have cost Iran a partner against U.S. sanctions]\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to know how much more pain the sanctions can inflict, or whether Iran will succeed in evading them by tricks like blending its oil with foreign oil, and removing electronic identity tags from its tankers.\n\nEuropeans who were partners with the United States in enforcing previous sanctions and negotiating the nuclear accord issued a statement Friday lamenting the U.S. actions and vowing to try to keep the deal alive. To circumvent sanctions, the Europeans have proposed setting up a clearing house for trade with Iran, with payments in goods instead of cash. But the complicated mechanism has not been formed yet, and U.S. officials are skeptical it would ever function.\n\nThe Europeans appear to have at least some leverage, however \u2014 mostly in terms of blocking American efforts to ban Iran from SWIFT, a Belgium-based banking messaging service designed to facilitate financial transactions. Of the company\u2019s 25-seat board, only JPMorgan and Citi are U.S. banks. In theory, European operators could defy Washington on banning Iran from the service. But U.S. authorities announced that they could threaten banks on the company\u2019s board unwilling to review their policy on Iran.\n\nThe differences ensure that the United States will find few allies willing to help them enforce the sanctions.\n\n\u201cWe may be very vigilant in terms of trying plug the holes in sanctions regime, but the fact is we\u2019re not going to be joined by too many others,\u201d said Dennis Ross, a former Middle East envoy who now is with the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. \u201cSo we\u2019re going to have to be doing this largely on our own.\u201d\n\nLittle is expected to happen on Monday, beyond a relisting of about 400 people and companies that were delisted when the nuclear agreement took effect, and the addition of about 300 others. Officials say they will release the names of the eight nations that have been granted temporary waivers from secondary sanctions so they can continue to buy oil.\n\nBut sanctions apply to activities that happen from Monday going forward, so it could be weeks or longer before any new punishments come down.\n\n\u201cPeople have to actually break rules,\u201d said Jarret Blanc, who worked on monitoring Iranian compliance on the nuclear deal in the Obama administration and now is with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \u201cCases have to be built, and the administration has to decide whether to immediately sanction. Under normal sanctions it takes months.\u201d\n\nIran will likely hobble along. Turkey and India are expected to get waivers. China, the biggest customer for Iranian oil, has sent mixed signals.\n\nEven less uncertain are the prospects for Iran to change its behavior and renegotiate the nuclear deal, the ultimate U.S. goals.\n\n\u201cAs they face the economic heat, they will have a strong incentive to negotiate,\u201d said Robert Einhorn, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. \u201cBut they\u2019ll want to make sure that they\u2019re negotiated with a United States willing to be reasonably flexible in arriving at the outcome. So far, all they see is the Trump administration determined to force them to capitulate or collapse.\u201d\n\nJames McAuley in Paris, Quentin Ari\u00e8s in Brussels, Min Joo Kim in Seoul and Akiko Kashiwagi in Tokyo contributed to this report", "KABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 American military officials say a member of the Utah National Guard has been killed in an apparent \u201cinsider attack\u201d in the capital of Afghanistan.\n\nThe officials say another U.S. service member is being treated for wounds sustained in the attack in Kabul on Saturday.\n\nA statement from a spokeswoman for the NATO-led Operation Resolute Support says the attacker was a member of the Afghan security forces and that initial reports indicate the assailant was immediately killed by other Afghan forces.\n\nThe Utah National Guard has identified the service member killed as a member of the Guard.

The question now for New Caledonia is whether to keep these faraway bonds or splinter off as the world\u2019s newest nation.\n\nOn Sunday, an electorate of some 175,000 will participate in a landmark referendum on independence from France \u2014 a decision that touches on major issues including the economy and cultural identity.\n\nAccording to recent polls, New Caledonians are expected to vote overwhelmingly to remain among France\u2019s \u201coutre-mer,\u201d or overseas territories, a modern-day relic of the once-vast French empire.\n\nThe pro-French side is so confident that it is aiming for a wide enough margin of victory to effectively eliminate any possibility of another independence referendum.\n\nBut the vote also highlights an issue that will not be resolved at the ballot box: the long-standing complaint by some of the indigenous Kanak people that the archipelago has ceded too much to the descendants of French colonists and their culture.\n\nGrand Chief Berg\u00e9 Kawa, 71, has a specific reason that he will vote to secede.\n\nAt the back of his hut, hidden between the looming columns of pine trees and coconut palms, Kawa keeps the skull of his great-uncle Chief Ata\u00ef \u2014 leader of an 1878 rebellion against French colonizers for which he was beheaded.\n\n\n\nKanak Chief Berg\u00e9 Kawa speaks during a ceremony on Aug. 28, 2014, in Paris, before the return to New Caledonia of the skull of the Kanak chief Ata\u00ef, his great-uncle, who was killed in 1878 fighting French colonialism. (Bertrand Guay/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nIn 2014, Kawa recovered the skull from Paris after it was found in the city\u2019s botanical gardens. It had been taken to France 136 years earlier, displayed in its museums as a trophy of colonial conquest, and then was lost in the gardens in Paris after World War II.\n\n\u201cIt makes my skin crawl,\u201d Kawa said.\n\nBut, though he has brought Ata\u00ef back to New Caledonia, Kawa cannot bury his remains. The tribal land where he believes his great-uncle should be interred was confiscated from his clan over a century ago. It is now privately owned.\n\n\u201cWe no longer live on our land,\u201d said Kawa, who faces charges for forcing an unwelcome French visitor from his property. \u201cIt\u2019s the white people who live here now. . . . Of course we want independence.\u201d\n\nNew Caledonia, hundreds of miles east of Australia, was annexed by France in 1853. It remains one of 13 French overseas territories around the globe. The last French territory to claim independence was Djibouti, more than 40 years ago.\n\nNew Caledonia\u2019s referendum is the climax of a 30-year process to repair ethnic tensions between French descendants and the indigenous Kanak people. In 1988, a three-way peace treaty \u2014 \u00adinvolving the French state, anti-independence and pro-independence separatists \u2014 was signed to end a bloody civil war, referred to as \u201cthe Events\u201d by locals.\n\nThe accord delineated a transfer of some powers from France to New Caledonia and a steady path toward an independence \u00adreferendum.\n\n\n\nThe burial of 19 Kanak people killed on May 8, 1988, in an assault three days earlier by French security forces in the Gossanah cave, where Kanaks had been holding several police officers hostage.

The flags belong to the Kanak and Socialist National Liberation Front, or FLNKS, a coalition of separatist parties campaigning for a \u201cyes\u201d vote.\n\nThe FLNKS was once considered a militant organization by the French state for its involvement in the civil war, though members now hold influential positions in the territory\u2019s provincial governments.\n\nTribal leaders often accuse the indigenous officials serving in provincial posts of being agents of the French colonial system and abandoning the native chiefs, who claim ultimate authority over the land.\n\nBut Sylvain Pabouty, an elected FLNKS minister of South Province, said indigenous separatists must engage with the territory\u2019s politics to dampen France\u2019s colonial influence.\n\n\u201cWhen the government passes public policy, they do so as an extension of their colonial past,\u201d Pabouty said. \u201cWe have to propose a social project that radically changes this colonial way of doing things.\u201d\n\nThe \u201csocial project\u201d generally involves policies to improve the lives of New Caledonia\u2019s poorest Kanaks: regulating water supply in city slums, building hospitals that are accessible to rural populations, opening mines near isolated communes to spur local economies.\n\nIn Noumea, the Pacific\u2019s cruise-ship capital and the administrative capital of New Caledonia, economic life is irrigated by the French state.\n\nFrance transfers $1.5 billion to the territory each year, which in part sustains the wages of Noumea\u2019s civil servants, who can earn up to 1.8 percent more than they would in mainland France. New Caledonia\u2019s gross domestic product is higher than that of all other provinces in France, except for the Paris region.\n\nThe economic benefits are largely spurring the vote against independence.\n\n\u201cWe have faces of a thousand colors here,\u201d anti-independence politician Thierry Santa said at a recent rally in Noumea for his Republican Party of New Caledonia. \u201cAnd despite these differences between our skins, for a great number of us, our hearts still beat for France.\u201d\n\n\n\nA police post in the settlement of Fayaoue in New Caledonia\u2019s Loyalty Islands province.

(Paul Schemm/Addis Ababa, Ethiopia)\n\nMENEGASHA, Ethiopia \u2014 On a wooded hill near Ethiopia\u2019s capital of Addis Ababa, bits of red clay litter the ground next to glittering flakes of obsidian. Nearby, half-buried stones are arranged in a line. On the other side of the hill, a rectangular stone slab appears to have been broken in half.\n\nFor archaeologists like Samuel Walker and his colleague Ayele Tarekegn, it\u2019s evidence that this was once the site of a medieval city. The bits of clay are shards of pottery, the flakes of obsidian were tools used by artisans to work leather, and the stones probably were once the walls of churches and palaces.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable that it\u2019s here,\u201d Walker said. \u201cWhen I saw this, I thought this is just the tip of the iceberg \u2014 everywhere we dig, we find stuff.\u201d\n\nArchaeological digs are rare in Ethiopia, despite its wealth of potential sites. \u201cIt\u2019s a poor country, and archaeology is a very expensive subject,\u201d said Ayele, who is trying to develop the field in the country. \u201cIt\u2019s all to do with money and developing the expertise, the personnel and the manpower.\u201d\n\nThere are plans to organize a conference of donors in January to develop Ethiopian archaeology, preserve existing sites and maybe explore new ones. More investment in the field could shed light on little-known parts of the country\u2019s history. Perhaps more important, it may bring clarity to some of the modern debates roiling Ethiopia as it transitions from oppressive authoritarianism to a freer society in which its many ethnic groups can make their voices heard.\n\nWhen reformist Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed came to office in April, he sought to open up the country by inviting back exiled rebels, releasing political prisoners and ending long-running government repression.\n\nHis changes have been enormously popular, but they have also been accompanied by unrest. With more than 80 ethnic groups competing for land and influence, animosities suppressed by the old government have risen to the surface, especially between the two main groups: the Oromo \u2014 the largest in the country, but one that has long felt marginalized \u2014 and the Amhara, the historical rulers of much of Ethiopia.\n\n[Abiy Ahmed pulls off an astonishing turnaround for Ethiopia]\n\nBoth groups are sparring over which can lay claim to the capital, Addis Ababa. The Oromo say it was their land before Emperor Menelik II, the ruler of the Amhara-dominated Abyssinian Empire, took it away to found the city in 1887. The Amhara say it was part of their empire long before the Oromo migrated there.\n\nThe remnants of the cities that Walker has found could help answer these questions. Suddenly, history and archaeology have become political.\n\nWhile there are medieval ruins in Ethiopia, not much is known about the period. A map of the region drawn in 1450 by a Venetian monk showed Ethiopia covered in cities like the one Walker found. \u201cThe material culture we have surviving from that time shows significant direct importing of religious and cultural material from as far away as France and Flanders. It is incredibly wealthy and artistically articulate,\u201d said Verena Krebs, an expert on medieval Ethiopia at Germany\u2019s Ruhr-University Bochum.\n\nBut when the Portuguese arrived in the 16th century, they found a place with few permanent settlements. So what happened in the intervening years? War. To be precise, religious wars.\n\nIn the 1520s, Ethiopia\u2019s Muslim vassal states rebelled against the Christian hegemony. Their forces descended on what was then the Abyssinian Empire and sought to destroy it, burning palaces, monasteries and trading posts and carrying off untold riches in gold and silver.\n\nWith Portuguese help, the Ethiopians defeated the Muslims, but the two adversaries were left exhausted. The Ethiopian forces retreated from the area around modern-day Addis Ababa; into the vacuum came the Oromo people from the south. They settled the area and worked the land as farmers and herders until most traces of the ruined cities had vanished.\n\nWalker, using a combination of ancient maps, Google Earth and a knowledge of trade routes, is hunting for those lost cities.\n\nSuch discoveries could remind modern Ethiopians of their country\u2019s past as a wealthy, cosmopolitan trading empire with contacts around the world. Abiy, the new prime minister, has said he wants to restore the country\u2019s links with the outside world, especially its international trade.\n\nAs anger between Ethiopia\u2019s many peoples reaches a fever pitch \u2014 some 1.4 million people have been displaced this year by violence across the country \u2014 archaeology may provide a timely warning about how war, fanaticism and ethnic rivalry destroyed Ethiopia in the past.\n\nRead more:\n\nEthiopia\u2019s ethnic divides rock capital as reports of killings prompt angry protests\n\nEthiopia\u2019s reforming prime minister runs into a roadblock of ethnic unrest\n\nAs a new leader rises in Ethiopia, its diaspora dares to dream", "\n\nJanet Hill, a registered nurse, works with a client at the Human Service Center in Peoria, Ill., on Sept. 5. The Human Service Center specializes in the intake and assessment of individuals with drug and alcohol problems, offering psychiatric assessment and medication treatment services for those battling addiction. (Fred Zwicky/Journal Star/AP)\n\nCongress has passed and President Trump has signed new legislation designed to turn back the opioid epidemic. The motivation for new legislation is clear: The opioid crisis is now one of the worst epidemics in U.S. history, having claimed the lives of more Americans than both world wars combined. But everyone should be mindful that because epidemics are dynamic, the impact of any new policy can change dramatically over time.\n\nMy colleagues, Allison Pitt and Margaret Brandeau, and I present a predictive model of the effects of various opioid-related policies in this month\u2019s issue of the American Journal of Public Health. Because the model projects impacts for the first five years, as well as years 6 to 10, that a given policy is in place, it reveals how the effectiveness of policies is time-dependent.\n\nFor example, more tightly scheduling opioids so that they are harder to prescribe causes an enormous loss in population life years (1.33 million) in its first five years because of how it affects individuals currently addicted to prescription opioids. Some of those individuals will stop using opioids (including, in some cases, with the aid of addiction treatment), but others are projected to switch to heroin (including heroin combined with fentanyl) and to die of overdoses as a result. However, in years 6 to 10, the same policy has a positive impact on population life years as the benefits of not addicting the next generation of patients to opioids starts outweighing the impact of leading some already pill-addicted individuals to switch to heroin.\n\nTwo other policies, expanding access to the overdose rescue drug naloxone and to medication-assisted treatment (e.g., methadone, naltrexone) increase life years in both five-year periods. Unlike changes in prescribing policies, these policies only affect people who are already addicted. They add to population life expectancy immediately and in the long term. Our predictive model found this to be the case for all other prevalent services for opioid-addicted individuals (e.g., psychosocial treatments, needle-exchange programs).\n\nIf services targeted to already opioid-addicted people harm no one and are consistently beneficial to population health over time, why not only employ such policies and never change how opioids are prescribed? Simply put, epidemics don\u2019t go away if the policy response is limited to treating already-ill individuals. To turn around the HIV/AIDS epidemic, preventive measures such as encouraging safer sex were essential, just as campaigns promoting hand-washing and covering one\u2019s mouth while sneezing are essential for arresting flu epidemics. The same lesson applies to the opioid epidemic: Waiting passively for people to become addicted and then trying to help them will ensure the epidemic goes on forever, particularly given that the United States prescribes more opioids per capita than any other nation in the world, by a huge margin.\n\nBecause the number of people who could become addicted is much larger than the number who are addicted at any given moment, the potential gains from preventive steps have a larger impact as the years go by. To appreciate the power of prevention, consider that in the second five years of implementation, the life years gained from tighter scheduling of opioids (410,000) is larger than that of expanded naloxone and medication-assisted treatment combined.\n\nBecause the net effect on life years of the first five and the second five years combined is still negative over a decade, rescheduling opioids more tightly is probably a bad idea. But other opioid prescription-reducing policies addressed in our modeling research (e.g., cutting down on opioids for people with sprained ankles) return net health benefits more quickly and thus deserve consideration even if they have some short-term costs.", "\n\nHillary Clinton celebrates on stage after accepting the presidential nomination at the Democratic National Convention on July 28, 2016. (Michael Robinson Chavez/The Washington Post)\n\nIn the 2018 midterm election campaign, many female gubernatorial candidates have argued that their campaigns would be good for young women and girls in their states. In Idaho, for example, where Paulette Jordan and Kristin Collum are running for governor and lieutenant governor respectively, Collum declared, \u201cWhether or not I win . . . I\u2019ve given [young women] a role model. They can do this, too, and they should not let anything stop them.\u201d\n\nSuch statements echo Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton\u2019s message during the 2016 campaign. Clinton frequently reminded voters that her election would mean that \u201ca father can tell his daughter: Yes, you can be anything you want to be. Even president of the United States.\u201d\n\nAre such claims just campaign rhetoric? Or might they influence the willingness of parents \u2014 and particularly fathers, the group that Clinton targeted in her appeals \u2014 to support female candidates?\n\nOur research, newly published at Political Behavior, suggests that some voters \u2014 in particular, fathers whose first child is a girl \u2014 are indeed influenced by such claims. During the 2016 election, men whose first child was a girl were more likely than men whose first child was a boy to vote for Clinton or to support a fictional female congressional candidate delivering a similar pitch.\n\nHow we did our research\n\nAs we wrote here recently, becoming a father of a first daughter leads men to more strongly support policies that promote gender equality. Simply being the father of a daughter doesn\u2019t do it; any daughter after the first has much less effect on men\u2019s attitudes toward gender equity policies. Mothers aren\u2019t affected in the same way, as they\u2019ve already dealt with gender issues before becoming parents.\n\nWe suspected that these same fathers might be more likely to strongly support female candidates for political office \u2014 especially if these candidates highlight the benefits of their candidacies for young women and girls.\n\nTo test this possibility, we designed an original survey of 382 American fathers and 514 American mothers embedded in the 2016 Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES), which was administered both before and after the 2016 election. In the survey, we asked each respondent about the gender and birth order of each of their children; whether they voted for Clinton in 2016; and for information about parents\u2019 partisanship, ideology, education, age, religiosity, income employment status, marital status, evaluations of the economy, racial attitudes and gender attitudes, to control for other factors that influenced support for Clinton.\n\nControlling for the factors listed above, we find that having a first daughter increases the probability of support for Clinton by 10 percentage points in the 2016 presidential election when compared to fathers of first sons. Mothers\u2019 voting patterns remained the same, no matter the sex of their first child. What\u2019s more, having a first daughter has similar effects among Democratic and Republican fathers, although the message was more appealing among Democrats.\n\nWe followed up with a survey experiment in which we randomly assigned our sample of mothers and fathers to three different groups. Each group was given a description of a fictional congressional candidate named \u201cMolly Smith.\u201d The first group read a description of Smith as running to become the first woman to represent Minnesota\u2019s fictional 10th District. The second group was told that, and also that Smith \u201csupports policies that would help increase the participation of women in careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.\u201d\n\n[Analysis: The Kavanaugh confirmation polarized women, and motivated them to vote \u2014 some for Republicans, some for Democrats]\n\nIn addition to reading the information given to the first two groups, the third group also read a quotation attributed to Smith, designed to mirror Clinton\u2019s appeal to fathers of daughters: \u201cThis campaign is about making sure there are no ceilings, no limits on any of us, and to ensure that our daughters will forever know that there is no barrier to who they are and what they can be in the United States of America.\u201d\n\nFirst daughters influence how fathers respond to such appeals\n\nFathers of first daughters were more likely than fathers of first sons to support a female candidate, particularly when the candidate makes an explicit appeal to fathers of daughters. Fathers of first daughters in the second group, in which our female candidate only emphasized expanding opportunities for women in STEM fields, were nine percentage points more likely to support our fictional female candidate than were fathers of first sons. But fathers of first daughters in the third group, in which the candidate also emphasized the importance of her campaign for daughters, were a whopping 25 percentage points more likely to support the candidate than were fathers of first sons. Again, these appeals only affected fathers, not mothers.\n\n[Analysis: Will there be a \u2018rainbow wave\u2019?

(Eric Gay/AP)\n\nThe total price of President Trump\u2019s military deployment to the border, including the cost of National Guard forces that have been there since April, could climb well above $200 million by the end of 2018 and grow significantly if the deployments continue into next year, according to analyst estimates and Pentagon figures.\n\nThe deployment of as many as 15,000 troops to the U.S.-Mexico border \u2014 potentially equal in size to the U.S. troop presence in Afghanistan \u2014 occurs as the budgetary largesse the military has enjoyed since Trump took office looks set to come to an end.\n\nAlthough the costs of the border deployments will be a tiny slice of a $716 billion annual defense budget, they arrive as the Trump administration is calling on the Pentagon to cut unnecessary expenditures. The White House recently ordered the Pentagon to slash next year\u2019s budget for the military by about $33 billion in response to the largest increase in the federal deficit in six years.\n\nVeterans and Democratic lawmakers have complained that Trump is wasting military dollars in a politically motivated stunt ahead of Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections, at a time when the Pentagon budget is under pressure.\n\n\u201cInstead of working in a bipartisan manner to make comprehensive, common-sense, and humane reforms to our immigration system, the President continues to turn to politically-motivated fear mongering and uses [Department of Defense] resources and personnel as a means to drive his troubling anti-immigration agenda,\u201d more than 100 House Democrats wrote in a letter to Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on Nov. 1.\n\nRetired Gen. Martin Dempsey, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, described the deployment as \u201cwasteful\u201d in a message on Twitter and said Marines and soldiers were already overstretched.\n\nAdministration officials have defended the deployment. Mattis said this week that the military doesn\u2019t do stunts. The commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, Kevin McAleenan, argued that the deployment is necessary to \u201ceffectively and safely\u201d handle the possible arrival of as many as 7,000 migrants walking toward the border in caravans from Central America.\n\nBut military planning documents, dated Oct. 27 and published by Newsweek, predicted that only 20 percent of the migrants, or about 1,400 at the higher end of estimates, were likely to complete the journey to the border, raising questions about the size of the deployment.\n\n\u201cThe military has a lot of things that it needs to be doing these days,\u201d said Susanna Blume, a former Pentagon official and senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security. \u201cLooking at estimates of the size of the caravan, you could ask the question as to whether this is the most appropriate use of U.S. active-duty forces.\u201d\n\nIt isn\u2019t clear how many U.S. troops will end up on the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nAbout 2,000 forces from the National Guard are already there, operating under an order Trump issued in April. Northern Command has said more than 7,000 additional active-duty troops will join them in Arizona, Texas and California. Trump said this week that he will be deploying between 10,000 and 15,000 troops but didn\u2019t make clear whether those figures included the National Guard.\n\nThe cost of the National Guard deployment from April 10 through Sept. 30 amounted to $103 million, according to Pentagon figures. The Defense Department expects the Guard deployment to cost an additional $308 million through the end of next September, including the last quarter of 2018, as long as the operations continue apace.\n\nActive-duty forces, which Trump deployed under his recent order, generally are less expensive because they don\u2019t require additional pay or benefits.\n\nTravis Sharp, a research fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budget Assessments, estimated that the cost of deploying 8,000 active-duty troops through mid-December in addition to the Guard would amount to $40 million to $50 million. Should the administration deploy 15,000 active-duty troops, as Trump suggested, the estimated cost would rise to as much as $110 million, Sharp said.\n\nThe forces could end up staying past mid-December, depending on the status of the caravans, which by most accounts are still weeks away from the border. An extension of the deployment could result in costs in excess of those estimates.\n\nAs of Saturday morning, about 3,500 active-duty service members have been deployed as a part of the mission, dubbed Operation Faithful Patriot, said Maj. Mark Lazane, a Northern Command spokesman. They include about 2,250 in Texas, 1,100 in California and 170 in Arizona, he said.\n\nPhotographs taken Friday at the port of entry in Hidalgo, Tex., show U.S. soldiers stringing concertina wire while working with CBP. The soldiers are wearing standard camouflage uniforms along with body armor and helmets, and appear unarmed.\n\nLazane said soldiers who do not typically use firearms in their day-to-day jobs while stateside will continue to work without them, though Gen. Terrence O\u2019Shaughnessy, the chief of Northern Command, has the authority to change that if desired.\n\nDemocrats have complained that in addition to paying for the border deployments, the Defense Department internally allocated $7.5 million to advanced planning for a 37-mile barrier along the side of a military bombing range in Arizona that abuts the border. Democratic lawmakers said the barrier alone could cost as much as $450 million.\n\nMattis offered a safety justification for the barrier in testimony to Congress earlier this year, suggesting that any migrants crossing the border through the range could end up hurt. Critics have said the project amounts to a move by the president to build part of the border wall he promised on the campaign trail by tapping military resources.\n\nDeputy Defense Secretary Patrick M. Shanahan said last week that the White House had instructed the Pentagon to prepare a $700 billion budget for 2020 \u2014 about 4.5 percent less than the $733 billion the department had planned.\n\nThomas Spoehr, a retired Army lieutenant general and director of the Heritage Foundation\u2019s Center for National Defense, said many of the units deploying to the border are fulfilling duties approximate to their wartime missions and could end up with good training from the field. He said the expenditure would be marginal in terms of the overall American defense budget.\n\n\u201cThe military needs every dollar it can get. Having said that, this is not in the scheme of things a huge thing,\u201d Spoehr said. \u201cIt probably will pass almost unnoticed in terms of the budget.\u201d\n\nDan Lamothe contributed to this report.", "TEHRAN, Iran \u2014 Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader says on the eve of the anniversary of the 1979 takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran that the Islamic Republic is the \u201cvictorious party\u201d after nearly 40 years of confrontation by the U.S.\n\nAyatollah Ali Khamenei said Saturday that despite military, economic and propaganda wars waged by the U.S. against Iran over the last four decades, \u201cthe U.S. is the defeated side and the Islamic Republic is the victorious party.\u201d\n\nMilitant Iranian students stormed the U.S. embassy on Nov. 4, 1979 and took 52 American diplomats hostages for 444 days.\n\nKhamenei said the U.S. has failed to dominate Iran in the way it did before the 1979 Islamic Revolution that ousted a pro-Western monarchy.

John Wall, Bradley Beal and Otto Porter Jr. are in their sixth season together. Markieff Morris is 29. Dwight Howard turns 33 next month. The Wizards may be young in age because they have several players who didn\u2019t stay in college beyond their sophomore years. But they are not a young team, not with all that NBA experience. They are not a raw group with limitless potential that deserves patience.\n\nThey are, even as dark as it looks now, what they have been for most of the past five years: a low-tier Eastern Conference playoff contender with a bad habit of floundering for long stretches of seasons and putting themselves in difficult positions. At 1-7, this season isn\u2019t over. They will get better, probably even make-the-postseason better. But in the big picture, they will never get right. They are terminally addicted to drama, finger-pointing and underachieving. The accumulation of exasperating, uneven performances over the past five years provides compelling evidence to support what should happen next.\n\nBlow it up.\n\nGive the Wizards November to show dramatic, sustainable improvement. If they can\u2019t do it, owner Ted Leonsis should give the order to start over.\n\n[Dwight Howard\u2019s long-awaited debut does little to help Wizards\u2019 sagging defense]\n\nFor the record, I don\u2019t think they will do it. They should, however. I didn\u2019t make this conclusion lightly, either, because I do believe there is value in simply making the playoffs most every year, especially in a league dominated by dynasties. The problem with the Wizards\u2019 situation is how joyless the experience has become. The fans are tired of watching a team that doesn\u2019t play together, that seems to have little respect for each other and that refuses to muster the professionalism and urgency to play consistent basketball.\n\nThe players have given every indication that they just don\u2019t mesh. But Ernie Grunfeld, the team president, has doubled down on this group. The front office has given max extensions to Wall, Beal and Porter. Heck, Wall will be a super-max player next season. And the team keeps adding to the core with veteran free agents who are good players but imperfect fits for the Wizards\u2019 volatile situation.\n\nThat\u2019s how you end up with the NBA\u2019s sixth-highest payroll and a team that must now crawl out of a hole just to be a playoff disappointment again. The Wizards keep repeating this vicious cycle, and the longer they wait to make a major adjustment, the more expensive change will become. Because Wall\u2019s four-year, $170 million deal is about to kick in, this season is really the last chance to ask existential questions about the current era.\n\nWall is scheduled to make $37.8 million next season in the first year of that contract. The Wizards wouldn\u2019t have any flexibility with him then, even though he is a talented and coveted player. In trying to deal a single star who makes that much money, the Wizards would struggle to get appropriate value for him, no matter how many teams it involved in an exotic trade. They would have to take back undesirable salaries, which would complicate the effort to rebuild without Wall.\n\nThat\u2019s why this season is so important. The Wizards will be locked into whatever they choose. The trio of Wall, Beal and Porter is overpriced considering the results. The team looks set to pay the luxury tax for the second straight year. Coach Scott Brooks, who is in the third year of a five-season deal, is one of the NBA\u2019s highest-paid coaches with an average annual salary of $7 million. And several of the role players on this roster are set to be free agents next summer, including Morris and Kelly Oubre Jr. The retention of a flummoxing squad is getting expensive.\n\n[Wizards continue downward spiral with blowout loss to Thunder]\n\nOn Friday night, after the Wizards gave up 79 points to Oklahoma City in the first half and lost, 134-111, at Capital One Arena , Brooks wondered about lineup changes he could make. He said something that the entire organization needs to consider.\n\n\u201cI have to figure it out,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t just keep watching the same thing over and over and over and expect things are going to change.\u201d\n\nOther than that, Brooks mostly protects his fragile team, asking the players to stay together and making references to how much he believes in them. It was a good opportunity for the coach to make some stronger remarks, but these are tense times. Wall and Beal ripped into the team after the fifth game this season, and if the Wizards didn\u2019t seem united before then, now they play like strangers.\n\nThe Wizards\u2019 bench failed them during the second quarter against Oklahoma City, but beyond that, the team quit for a portion of that game. The players didn\u2019t compete. And Brooks declined to get after them publicly, which shows how delicate he thinks the situation has become.\n\nHoward, who finally made his Washington debut, preached \u201cenergy and positivity\u201d afterward.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just got to change our mind-set,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Wizards have been trying to change their mind-set since 2013.\n\nIt starts at the top. Wall needs to be locked in at all times; he is showing disturbing signs of regression. Beal can\u2019t be satisfied with being only an offensive standout. And when their two best players criticize their teammates, they need to make sure they are just as harsh about their performances.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t teach effort,\u201d Wall said. \u201cYou can\u2019t teach heart. You\u2019ve just got to go out there and compete.\u201d\n\nBefore making a final judgment, we must allow the Wizards time to acclimate Howard and see whether they\u2019re better with him. That\u2019s why a month seems like a good timeline. But if they haven\u2019t made significant progress by December, all options need to be on the table. Every aspect of change would need to be considered, from trades to the jobs of Grunfeld and Brooks. And Leonsis would need to make the ground shake with his actions.\n\nCurrently, the Wizards are an embarrassment. They are 0-3 at home, and all the losses have come to bleary-eyed teams visiting on the second night of back-to-back games. They are allowing a league-worst 123.9 points per game. They give more effort whining to the refs than staying in a defensive stance.\n\nIt\u2019s time to change.

U-Md. President Wallace D. Loh fired the football coach Wednesday. (Patrick Semansky/AP)\n\nMichael Sokolove, a contributing writer for the New York Times Magazine, is the author of \u201cThe Last Temptation of Rick Pitino: A Story of Corruption, Scandal and the Big Business of College Basketball.\u201d\n\nBefore the University of Maryland\u2019s Board of Regents essentially pushed him out for daring to challenge the football coach, Wallace D. Loh, the school\u2019s president, liked to refer to the athletic department as the school\u2019s \u201cfront porch.\u201d In recent years, this has become a kind of a trope of American universities, and I heard about the \u201cfront porch\u201d countless times while reporting a new book on the University of Louisville. It is meant to signify that their football and basketball teams will attract interest and engage people from around the nation who might otherwise just pass the place by. They\u2019ll stop, take a closer look and see all the other great things inside: the first-class chemistry labs, the award-winning nursing school, whatever it is that goes on inside the English department. You know, the academics.\n\nAttention-grabbing teams, the theory holds, can attract more freshman applicants, lifting the average test scores; help snare more donations from alumni; and improve campus life by giving everyone something to rally around.\n\nBut cause and effect is not always easy to discern. Duke University was a great school before fabled coach Mike Krzyzewski built its basketball team into a perennial powerhouse. The University of California at Berkeley hired a new athletic director this summer who touted the \u201cfront porch\u201d and said he hoped to use the football team as a \u201cplatform for our university to celebrate what makes it exceptional.\u201d Berkeley has not played in a major bowl game since 1959, but it has long been a great school; failures on the gridiron have hardly held it back.\n\nEventually, the sports sales pitch began to remind me of the Las Vegas casino-hotels. To get to your room, you have to wind your way around the blackjack tables, past the noisy crowds playing roulette and through the rows of slot machines. It lets you know what\u2019s important. Except, while gambling is the point of a casino, sports are not the point of a university \u2014 although inadvertently, perhaps, and often catastrophically, they become the point.\n\nThe University of Maryland has 39,000 students (from all 50 states and 118 countries) and 4,400 faculty members (including four Nobel laureates). Most of what goes on at the university has absolutely nothing to do with sports. And yet the events of the past several months \u2014 starting with the tragic death of a football player \u2014 show the unique ability of sports to throw a campus into chaos.\n\n[College sports exploits unpaid black athletes. But they could force a change.]\n\nOn May 29, Jordan McNair, a 19-year-old offensive lineman on Maryland\u2019s football team, suffered heatstroke during a strenuous practice on a hot late-spring day. He died two weeks later. It was a preventable death: More than an hour elapsed from the time he first showed symptoms to when the team\u2019s medical staff finally called an ambulance. They never gave him the standard treatment of cold-water immersion; that occurred only after he reached the hospital.\n\nTwo months later, an ESPN investigative report described what it called a \u201ctoxic\u201d culture under Maryland\u2019s head coach, DJ Durkin, in which coaches belittled players who couldn\u2019t complete conditioning drills and subjected them to homophobic slurs. \"If a kid would stop or go on the ground,\u201d former player J.T. Ventura said, they were sometimes dragged to their feet and made to continue. A strength and conditioning coach hired by Durkin was alleged to have been particularly brutal \u2014 including incidents in which he was said to have thrown \u201cfood, weights and on one occasion a trash can full of vomit\u201d at players, according to a report released after an external investigation.\n\nDurkin, 40, was in just his second year as a head coach. His record was not good \u2014 his teams at Maryland won just 10 of the 25 games he coached \u2014 but he had worked under two revered coaches, Urban Meyer, at Bowling Green and Florida, and Jim Harbaugh, at Stanford and Michigan, and was valued for his pedigree and potential. After the ESPN report, the school at first put Durkin on leave while it investigated. He continued to be paid his $2.5 million annual salary.\n\nAt 73, Loh, the Maryland president, was a generation older than his football coach. He held a doctorate in psychology from the University of Michigan and a law degree from Yale University. His salary was $675,000, about a quarter of what Durkin was paid. In the years since Loh was hired away from the University of Iowa in 2010, he raised $1.2 billion in private donations, including a record $219 million gift last year. About 41,200 prospective students applied for admission in 2017, up 18 percent in six years.\n\nHow much of this has to do with sports is impossible to say. Maybe not much. It\u2019s true that the big NCAA sports powers generate huge revenue; the University of Texas tops the list at $214 million. But almost all of them spend as much as they take in (or more), mostly on multimillion-dollar coaches' salaries and gilded facilities. A study by the Chronicle of Higher Education found that less than $1 of every $100 in revenue generated by athletic departments at major colleges goes to academic programs. At Maryland, the football team has experienced mostly losing seasons and poor attendance. The basketball team, once a national power, has qualified for the NCAA postseason tournament in only three of the eight seasons Loh has led the school.\n\n[College football is rigged against black head coaches]\n\nLoh has been an enthusiastic advocate for sports at Maryland. He helped navigate the university\u2019s 2014 move from the Atlantic Coast Conference to the more lucrative Big Ten Conference. But he also told the University Senate last year that he presided over a number of \u201cdormant volcanoes\u201d on campus with the potential to wreak havoc and threaten his own tenure. \u201cOne of them is an athletic scandal,\u201d he said. \u201cIt blows up, it blows up the university, its reputation, it blows up the president.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, the University System of Maryland\u2019s Board of Regents announced that its own investigation into Jordan McNair\u2019s death and the culture of the football program had ended. It took issue with ESPN\u2019s description of the program as \u201ctoxic\u201d and, even while citing leadership issues with the team, restored Durkin as head coach. Loh, it appeared, had lost a power struggle. Instead of getting rid of an abusive coach, he announced he would retire in June. A day later, after protests by students, objections by some members of the team and questions by state politicians, the university reversed its decision, and Durkin was fired. But Loh\u2019s prediction that sports could turn a campus upside down had been prophetic.\n\nLoh had said after the tragedy of McNair\u2019s death that the university had to take \u201clegal and moral responsibility.\u201d It\u2019s not clear whether the University of Maryland has done that \u2014 or has just begrudgingly fired its football coach to stave off further embarrassments. And Loh, it appears, is still leaving his job. In the end, he took personal responsibility \u2014 and he took the fall.", "\n\nJockey Frankie Dettori sits on Enable, the even money favorite for the Breeders' Cup Turf.

(Sebastian Nogier/EFE-EXE) (Sebastien Nogier/EPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nAnyone trying to make an international call this weekend would be forgiven for getting a little mixed up.\n\nDaylight Saving Time ends in the United States on Sunday, bumping the clocks back an hour. The change happened in Europe a week earlier, meaning the time difference between the continents was momentarily smaller.\n\nIt\u2019s another confusing wrinkle in a confusing temporal process that confounds the world.\n\nToday, 70 countries change their clocks midyear for Daylight Saving Time, including most of North America, Europe and parts of South America and New Zealand. China, Japan, India and most countries near the equator don\u2019t fall back or jump ahead. In much of Asia and South America, the Daylight Saving Time shift was adopted, but then abandoned. It has never been observed in most of Africa.\n\nWhile the United States extended its Daylight Saving Time in 2005 and Florida wants to make it its standard time, other countries are moving to ditch the practice. The European Union is weighing a plan to abandon shifting from daylight saving time midyear. \u201cMillions . . . believe that summertime should be all the time,\u201d the European Union\u2019s chief executive, Jean-Claude Juncker, told German reporters in August. Juncker was referring, in part, to an online poll conducted by the E.U., which found that changing clocks is tremendously unpopular. (As my colleague Rick Noack pointed out, however, there are methodological problems: \u201cThe largest share of participants came from one country \u2014 Germany \u2014 where the time switch has been a somewhat odd front-page topic for years. But any E.U. decision would also impact the 27 other member states.\u201d)\n\nEven if the E.U. approved the change\u201a it would have to be approved by the European Parliament and each of the 28 member states. But it seems as if that\u2019s possible. Abolishing the Daylight Saving Time move is the rare bipartisan issue in Poland. Russia and Belarus ditched the process years ago. (Russian scientists claim the risk of heart attack jumped 50 percent and the suicide rate climbed when the clocks changed.)\n\nA few days ago, Morocco scrapped the Daylight Saving Time fallback, just before the clocks would have turned. It will save \u201can hour of natural light,\u201d Administrative Reform Minister Mohammed Ben Abdelkader told Maghreb Arabe Press.\n\nThe concept of Daylight Saving Time was proposed by several people around the world largely independently of one another. In 1895, George Hudson, a New Zealand entomologist, proposed shifting the clock two hours so bug hunters would have more sunlight in summer evenings. Seven years later, William Willett, a British builder, suggested shifting the clock to \u201cprevent the nation from wasting daylight.\u201d Willett made the proposal to the British Parliament and continued to advocate for it until he died in 1915.\n\nIn 1916, the German government adapted Willett\u2019s idea as a way to save money during World War I. Other European countries and the United States soon followed. In 1919, Daylight Saving Time was repealed in the United States. It returned, via federal law, in 1966. It was implemented by the European Union in the 1980s.\n\nRead more:\n\nDaylight saving time ends this weekend.

With just over 20 percent of S&P 500 company board seats occupied by women, it\u2019s no surprise that progressive legislators are putting pressure on companies to diversify their boards. This pressure is part of a larger wave of growing public scrutiny over board composition. A reasonable question, however, is whether this kind of public scrutiny is likely to move the needle meaningfully on boardroom diversity. To what extent is board composition shaped by outside pressure and inspection?\n\nWe recently examined this issue in a paper that is forthcoming in the Academy of Management Journal. We analyzed data on all directors seated on S&P 500 boards in 2013 \u2014 the most recently available data at the time of our study. Our question was this: Do boards seem to be \u201cgaming diversity\u201d in an effort to please the critics, or are they doing their best to include as many qualified women as possible? To figure this out, we first tallied the number of women seated on every board of directors in the S&P 500. We then compared these tallies to the counts you would expect to see if existing directors played a game of musical chairs and were reseated entirely at random.\n\nWhy did we do this, and what can it tell us? Well, if companies are working hard to avoid having zero female directors, we would expect to see a lot fewer boards with zero women than we would see in our simulated game of musical chairs. Indeed, we found that 45 percent fewer boards have zero women than you would expect based on our reshuffling exercise. This finding suggests that boards are exerting effort to avoid having zero female directors, even in the absence of legislation requiring this. In other words, if boards weren\u2019t being strategic about diversity, a few would just happen to include no women (because there aren\u2019t many female directors to go around), but 45 percent fewer have zero women than chance would predict (given the number of women already seated on boards).\n\nThis finding may not be surprising given the immense amount of negative press that leadership teams face for lacking diversity, particularly in light of evidence suggesting that gender diversity improves team performance. Consider the way Twitter was skewered in the media, for example, for making its initial public offering with zero women on its board, the way President Trump\u2019s Cabinet was criticized by the media for its lack of gender diversity and the way the #OscarsSoWhite movement emerged from the lack of racial diversity in Academy Award nominations.\n\nIt is certainly a good thing that companies are working hard to avoid having female-free boards of directors. But is this because of a genuine commitment to diversity based on an understanding of its many benefits, or might it be rooted in the fear of public scrutiny? To get at the heart of this question, we explored whether boards appear to recruit as many women as possible or, instead, target some socially acceptable level of gender diversity and then curtail their efforts.\n\nAt the time of our study, the average board included just under two women. If boards diversify because they fear public scrutiny, you might expect them to diversify just enough to beat the average and avoid standing out. If boards diversify as much as possible, there should be no evidence of this kind of gaming. In our board data, we find that there are 45 percent more boards including exactly two women than would be expected by chance, according to our game of musical chairs. We call this phenomenon \u201ctwokenism.\u201d\n\nIn short, boards worked hard to recruit two women, then efforts appear to have declined, presumably because they had hit the level of diversity they deemed satisfactory. Interestingly, this result is far more pronounced at companies that typically receive more media coverage, consistent with the idea that twokenism is a response to anticipated scrutiny.\n\nNo doubt, boards must weigh a wide variety of factors when adding members. One would be naive to ignore the complexity of the process involved. But the complexity of the process does not explain away our finding that a dramatically higher-than-chance number of boards include exactly two women. This is not about complexity.\n\nInterestingly, we can track the historical origins of twokenism. In 2002 and 2003, when the average number of women on boards hovered just below one, we saw an overabundance of boards including exactly one woman. In other words, tokenism was prevalent. Then, in 2004, when a few more women entered the boardroom and the average number of women per board tipped above one, a new norm was born. Starting in 2005, twokenism became dominant and tokenism vanished. We predict that \u201cthreekenism\u201d is around the corner, particularly if legislators and citizens continue pressuring boards to up the ante on diversity.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s new law is a legislative stake in the ground that all-male boards are no longer acceptable in U.S. corporations and suggests that outside scrutiny of boards will continue to intensify. Our research suggests that pressure to diversify is already influencing the composition of corporate boards and has been for many years. We have a long way to go before that pressure will be enough to produce parity, and now is the time to keep the pressure on, because it works.", "It was the second week of Islam class, and the teacher, Mansur Seddiqzai, stood in front of a roomful of Muslim teens and pointed to the sentence on the chalkboard behind him: \u201cIslam does not belong to Germany.\u201d\n\nHe scanned the room and asked, \u201cWho said this?\u201d\n\nHands shot up. \u201cThe AfD?\u201d a student with a navy blue headscarf said, referring to Germany\u2019s far-right anti-refugee party. \u201cNo,\u201d Seddiqzai shook his head. \u201cSeehofer,\u201d tried another. \u201cYes, and who is that?\u201d \u201cA minister,\u201d said a third.\n\nFinally, someone put it all together, identifying Horst Seehofer, the head of Bavaria\u2019s conservative Christian Social Union and Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s interior minister and coalition partner, who has on multiple occasions threatened to torpedo her government over the issue of immigration.\n\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s right,\u201d Seddiqzai said, turning to the others. \u201cAnd what do you think?

In 2016, 4.95 million people, or 6.1 percent of the German population, were Muslim. But less than half of those pray regularly, and even fewer regularly attend a mosque, according to the latest government surveys.\n\nThe country\u2019s leaders have expressed an ambivalent view of Islam, at best. Seehofer\u2019s statement that \u201cIslam does not belong to Germany\u201d came just months after the Islam-bashing AfD, or Alternative for Germany, entered parliament. Merkel denounced his statement and ruled out sharing power with the AfD. Nevertheless, the AfD has steadily gained support over the past two years: On Oct. 14, it scored the biggest electoral gains of any party in Bavaria, Germany\u2019s second-most populous state.\n\nLast year, the AfD hung campaign posters in Dortmund featuring women in burqas and the slogan \u201cStop Islamization.\u201d This year\u2019s poster bore the words \u00ad\u201cIslam-free schools!\u201d under an image of five beaming, light-skinned children.\n\nSeddiqzai, who was born to Afghan parents in the German city of Bochum, has a full beard and wears Nikes to school, said he worries about the effect on his students. \u201cThese posters tell them, \u2018We don\u2019t want you here,\u2019 \u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey are not accepted in Germany, they are not accepted in the countries of their parents, and that produces this craving for a group to belong to,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd then an Islamist comes to you and says, \u2018Yeah, you don\u2019t belong to anyone. Therefore just be Muslim.\u2019 They offer them a third way.\u201d\n\nSeddiqzai sees it as part of his job to make his students more informed in their consumption of such appeals.\n\nWhen local politicians were discussing a ban on headscarves this year, a group calling itself Reality Islam launched a social media campaign to protest the proposal and recruit students. Seddiqzai showed his students how to trace Reality\u2019s Islam\u2019s links to Hizb ut-Tahrir, an extremist group banned in Germany since 2003. He also encouraged them to question the group\u2019s stance on the headscarf, which it claimed the Koran mandates for women.\n\n\u201cI show them the Koranic verses about the headscarf, and we discuss it and we see there is no clear rule that a woman or girl has to wear a headscarf,\u201d he said. \u201cMost of them think the Koran itself has no contradictions, and even that is wrong. There are many contradictions in the Koran.\u201d\n\nSome German politicians are pushing for an expansion of Islam classes in public schools as a way to encourage the cultural integration of Muslim students and to promote an interpretation of Islam that highlights German values.\n\n\u201cWe need more religious education,\u201d Kerstin Griese, a law\u00admaker from the center-left Social Democratic Party, which is part of Merkel\u2019s ruling coalition, wrote in an op-ed, \u201cbecause it\u2019s the only way to start a dialogue about our own traditions and values and to understand those of others.\u201d\n\nSuch advocates generally don\u2019t envision non-Muslim students taking these classes to gain a better appreciation of Islam. While a few German school systems offer religion classes that include multiple faiths or ethics classes that touch on religion, religion as taught in public high schools and supported by Germany\u2019s Basic Law is generally targeted at specific denominations.\n\nA further rationale for Islam classes is to \u201cimmunize\u201d Muslim students from fundamentalism, as Protestant leader Heinrich Bedford-Strohm put it.\n\nOf particular concern is radicalization that might lead to violence. Since 2013, more than 1,000 people, most of them under 30 years old, have left Germany to fight with or support the Islamic State and other terrorist organizations.\n\nBut some educators and politicians resist the notion that Islam has a place in German public schools.\n\n\u201cBesides the fact that we have much more important problems in schools, it can\u2019t be true that a German bishop is promoting Islam,\u201d Alexander Gauland, a leader of the AfD, said after Bedford-Strohm voiced his proposal.\n\nNo studies have examined the effectiveness of Islam classes in preventing radicalization, according to Harry Harun Behr, a professor of Islamic studies and pedagogy at Frankfurt\u2019s Goethe University.\n\nStill, he said, the classes are valuable because they show students their faith is as important as others taught in their schools and because they show Islam as a religion that is open to reflection and self-criticism.\n\nAt Seddiqzai\u2019s school, where almost 95 percent of students are first- or second-generation immigrants, Islam class is highly popular. When he crosses the schoolyard, he can barely walk five steps without being stopped by a student wanting to tell him about grades, romances or plans for the future.\n\n\u201cWhat Mr. Seddiqzai is teaching me is not really something you learn at mosque,\u201d said 17-year-old Yusuf Akar. \u201cHow to interact with non-Muslims who may not be sure how to interact with us. Or who are scared of us.\u201d\n\nBut it is more than that, too. \u201cIt shows me I\u2019m welcome here,\u201d Akar said. \u201cBecause the school no longer demands that we distance ourselves from our religion. They accept it and even create an opportunity to learn about it. And that gives me the feeling that I\u2019m part of this society.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nMuslims and Jews test new bonds at Auschwitz amid season of intolerance in Europe\n\nMerkel and Macron defend a diminished vision of European values\n\nToday's coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "\n\nFall color around the U.S. Capitol.

Conditions head downhill into the workweek, but there should be plenty of drier moments intermixed, and temperatures should remain tolerable to warm overall.\n\nGet our daily forecasts on your Amazon Alexa device. Click here to find out how.\n\nToday (Saturday): The storm that rained on us last night is leaving, but clouds may stick around for a while this morning. They\u2019ll disappear with time as gusts increase into the midday and early afternoon. Those winds out of the northwest peak around 15 to 25 mph in the afternoon, which should mean gusts to 35 mph or so. With highs in the mid-50s to around 60, it\u2019ll be cool, but not to atypical for the date. Confidence: Medium-High\n\nTonight: Winds diminish a good deal with sunset. Add in clear skies and relatively dry air and we\u2019ve got a seasonably chilly night on tap. Lows range from near freezing to the low 40s, coldest in the suburbs to warmest in the city center. Remember to \u201cfall back\u201d with any of those old-school clocks that can\u2019t set themselves. Confidence: Medium-High\n\nFollow us on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram for the latest updates.

Sunshine should be prevalent as highs rise to near 60. Winds swing around to the south or southeast around 10 mph. We\u2019ll probably see some high cloudiness show up before the way-too-early sunset. Confidence: Medium-High\n\nTomorrow night: Clouds increase and thicken heading into the night. Rain becomes increasingly likely after midnight and toward dawn, especially south and southeast of the city. Lows range from the mid-40s to around 50. Confidence: Medium-High\n\nA LOOK AHEAD\n\nOn Monday, a developing coastal storm is passing by the region. There is some question as to exactly where it tracks. We\u2019re toward the edge, so that means a small shift can mean little to no rain or a good bit of rain. For now, the bottom line is we probably see clouds and at least a little rain. Details beyond are still very much to be determined. We should have a much better idea by later today or tomorrow. With rain around in some fashion, highs in the 50s seem a good bet. If it\u2019s dry, we near and even top 60. Confidence: Medium\n\nA strong storm system is wrapping up over the center of the country on Tuesday. Around here, we\u2019re in the warm flow around it for much of the day. This should mean highs in the 60s to perhaps around 70. While there\u2019s a good chance of some showers at some point, especially late, a good chunk of the day should be dry. I might suggest voting early in the day, just in case! We could be dealing with something similar to last night on Tuesday night.

(Hani Mohammed/Associated Press)\n\nCAIRO \u2014 The regional chief of the U.N. children\u2019s agency said Saturday that Yemeni authorities are making it difficult to deliver much-needed humanitarian aid and warned that impeding relief efforts could plunge the country into famine.\n\nGeert Cappelaere told The Associated Press in an interview from Yemen that recent U.S. calls for a cease-fire are imperative to ending the nearly four-year war, which pits a Saudi-led coalition against Iran-aligned rebels known as Houthis.\n\nHe visited the Red Sea port city of Hodeida and the rebel-held capital, Sanaa, over the past two days as clashes and airstrikes intensified. He said both the internationally-recognized Yemeni government and Houthi rebels \u201care not enabling us to do our work as fast as we should.\u201d\n\nCappelaere said he can\u2019t bring the best nutrition experts to the country because of delays in granting visas and that aid agencies face bureaucratic impediments the delay the import of supplies.\n\nHe criticized authorities with \u201cother interests\u201d for creating delays in the arrival and distribution of supplies, without elaborating.\n\nMost aid agencies operate in Houthi-held areas where they face movement restrictions. The rebels manipulate aid distribution by providing lists of beneficiaries and sometimes divert aid to their supporters.\n\nCappelaere\u2019s visit came shortly after the United States called for the cease-fire within 30 days. He said the situation is deteriorating, with millions unable to meet their basic needs.\n\nYemen has been at war since March 2015, when Houthis occupied northern Yemen, forcing the government into exile. Since then, a Saudi-led coalition supporting the government has blockaded the rebel-held north and waged a devastating air campaign. The U.S. has sold billions of dollars\u2019 worth of arms to Saudi Arabia and provides logistical and other support to the coalition.\n\n\u201cAn end to the conflict is ... a much-needed step but it needs to be complemented with investment and governance of this country that puts the interest of the people at the center and the interest of the children at the core of politics,\u201d Cappelaere said.\n\nThree-quarters of Yemen\u2019s 29 million people are food insecure, 1.8 million children suffer from malnutrition and 400,000 children under age 5 are at risk of death from starvation. Every 10 minutes a child dies of preventable diseases, according to UNICEF.\n\nAround 40 percent of the 400,000 are located in and around Hodeida, which has been the target of a stalled coalition offensive in recent months. The port is a key entry point for food and humanitarian aid, but the coalition says the Houthis also use it to import weapons.\n\nDuring a visit to Hodeida\u2019s main hospital, Cappelaere said he saw children suffering from severe malnutrition and others paralyzed by complications from diphtheria, an epidemic fueled by the breakdown of health services. He says many families in Hodeida cannot make it to hospitals because of airstrikes and shelling, or because they cannot afford transportation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s high time for authorities from both sides to take responsibility and enable that assistance without any conditions, without any hurdles,\u201d he said.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Early voting in Georgia ended Friday.\n\n\u201cIf you are aspiring to a higher office in which you pledge to look out for the people of your state, then how can you actively try to prevent the citizens of your state from exercising their most basic right?\u201d Obama said.\n\nAbrams and other activists have also criticized Kemp for continuing in his job as the state\u2019s top elections official while running for governor. Kemp has said that he is trying to protect the election system against fraud.\n\nObama also chided Kemp for withdrawing from a debate because it would have conflicted with Trump\u2019s visit. Kemp and Abrams were scheduled to square off for a second time Sunday at 5 p.m. Earlier this week ,Trump announced he would hold a rally in Macon, about 90 minutes southeast of Atlanta, on Sunday at 4 p.m. Atlanta\u2019s Channel 2, the debate sponsor, offered several options to reschedule the debate, but the campaigns could not agree on a new date and time.\n\n\u201cI saw her opponent backed out of that debate. He\u2019s going to go to a rally instead,\u201d Obama said. \u201cHe can\u2019t do both? What\u2019s he afraid of? He\u2019s afraid of Stacey, I guess.\u201d\n\nObama also continued his criticism of Trump and Republican congressional leaders for using scare tactics and \u201clies\u201d to rile up their base.\n\n\"Leaders at the highest levels of public office ... repeatedly, baldly, shamelessly lie \u2013 just make stuff up, just say things they know are not true.\u201d\n\n\u201cLies!\u201d the crowd chanted each time Obama paused between adverbs.\n\nHe also said voters should be wary of Republicans' newfound support for protecting preexisting conditions, a key component of the Affordable Care Act, which they have repeatedly vowed to and tried to repeal.\n\n\u201cI mean, they\u2019ve voted dozens of times to try to get rid of protections for preexisting conditions. Last year they fell one vote short,\u201d Obama said. \u201cIf they win Tuesday, they will be coming after health care again. \u2026 But a Democratic Congress will not let that happen.\u201d He also noted that Abrams has vowed to work to bring Medicaid expansion to Georgia, something that Kemp said would be too costly. He, too, has said he would protect preexisting conditions but has not specified how.\n\nObama also knocked Trump for a plan to send troops to the border in response to the caravan of migrants traveling up from Central America. \u201cThey\u2019re sending them down there for a political stunt. \u2026 Our military deserves better than that. That\u2019s not patriotism.\u201d\n\nThe former president leveled similar criticisms against his successor at a rally for Florida Democratic gubernatorial nominee Andrew Gillum. He would become the Sunshine State\u2019s first black governor if he beats Republican Ron DeSantis on Tuesday. Trump campaigned earlier this week in Florida for DeSantis, a former congressman, who has trailed Gillum, the mayor of Tallahassee, in the polls.\n\nAbrams, who holds a law degree from Yale and is the former Democratic leader of the Georgia state house, told the crowd that in the final few days of the campaign, she needed them to help her spread her message to people who haven\u2019t yet voted. \u201cWe are ready to cover a half million Georgians who don\u2019t have health insurance. We are ready to protect preexisting conditions,\u201d she said.\n\nAfter introducing Obama, Abrams sat behind him on a stage filled with supporters standing in front of a giant projected sign that read, \u201cOur chance. Our choice.\u201d It was the second time in as many days that she\u2019d shared the spotlight with a national celebrity. On Thursday, media mogul Oprah Winfrey was in suburban Atlanta to host two town halls with Abrams. She then went canvassing for Abrams, shocking and delighting unsuspecting people who answered their doors to find the longtime talk show queen standing on their steps.\n\n\n\nObama and Abrams pose for a photograph with two unidentified family members after the rally.

Martin Luther King Jr. was an alumnus, as are film director Spike Lee and Maynard Jackson, the first black mayor of Atlanta.\n\nThe school\u2019s Forbes Arena, which holds 6,000, was filled to the rafters, and people stood shoulder to shoulder in the floor space in front of the stage. The event at times felt like a pep rally, with people in the stands spontaneous chanting \u201cA-brams! A-brams!\u201d or doing crowd waves and dancing along to R&B and hip-hop music. Speakers included former attorney general Eric Holder as well as Lucy McBath and Carolyn Bordeaux, who are running competitive races against Republican incumbents in adjacent congressional districts in suburban Atlanta. The crowd took turns cheering candidates for Congress and the state legislature and calling out to several celebrities who showed up for the event, including actor Chris Tucker, rapper Two Chainz and Kandi Burruss of \u201cThe Real Housewives of Atlanta.\u201d\n\nChristine Boyd, wearing a knit cap with Obama's name in glittery letters, came to the rally with her son, Keith Russell. Boyd said she'd already voted early for Abrams; Russell said he always looks forward to going to vote on Election Day.\n\nBoth said they had been energized by the rally and would work harder to encourage others to vote.\n\n\u201cI like the energy, I like the enthusiasm, and I like that we will be a part of history,\u201d Boyd said. As for people who didn\u2019t attend the rally and didn\u2019t get that boost, she said: \u201cI think it\u2019s word of mouth. I think if all of us go home, talk to our neighbors, talk to our friends, talk to our family \u2014 it\u2019s going to take that kind of grass-roots effort in order to push her over the top. But we can do it.\u201d\n\nRep. John Lewis, the civil rights icon who represents Atlanta in Congress, brought a sense of history to the occasion, reminding the crowd that before African Americans got the right to vote, black lawyers, doctors and teachers in the South were told they couldn\u2019t read or write well enough to register to vote. \u201cWe are not going back. We have come too far! We are going forward!\u201d\n\n\u201cVote! Vote! Vote!\u201d the crowd chanted.\n\n\u201cIt is in our hands!

Those included giving up countless open looks on the perimeter as Oklahoma City hit nine of its 15 three-pointers in the first half, and Westbrook and his cast ran wild in transition largely because of the Wizards\u2019 18 turnovers.

That spoiled a promising start to the night for center Dwight Howard, who was making his Wizards debut after missing the first seven games of the season with a buttocks injury.\n\nHoward (20 points) won over the crowd early, finishing a three-point play after being fouled on the team\u2019s first possession. He finished another alley-oop from Wall and looked perfectly nimble on the way to 13 first-quarter points. At that point, it seemed as if the Wizards were a different team than the one that had lost six of its first seven games.\n\nBut any defensive adjustments that Brooks had tried to make entering this game against his former team were rendered ineffective. Even as the Wizards shot 59 percent in the first half and made all but one free throw, they still trailed by 29 after surrendering an 18-2 run. Westbrook was the facilitator \u2014 he had seven of his 12 assists during an 11-minute span in the first half.\n\nWestbrook finished with 23 points on 10-for-16 shooting and added four steals. Paul George finished with 17 points as Oklahoma City shot 57 percent from the field.\n\n\u201cThe way to go is defensively. We never have problems offensively scoring. Dwight being there helped us out on the defensive boards and getting rebounds and that aspect of the game, being able to finish in the post and being able to finish around the basket,\u201d Wall said. \u201cBut you still have to defend at a high level. And we\u2019re still not doing that.\u201d\n\n[Box score: Thunder 134, Wizards 111]\n\nWestbrook checked back in midway through the second quarter and immediately imposed his will.

Beal grabbed his coach\u2019s clipboard and tried to diagram defensive adjustments his teammates should make.\n\n\u201cI was just trying to explain where our help was supposed to come from. I was just trying to encourage guys more and more,\u201d Beal said.\n\nIt didn\u2019t help. Beal threw the ball away on the ensuing possession, which led to a Westbrook dunk. Wall followed with a turnover, and Westbrook came away with another steal and hit teammate Jerami Grant (22 points) for a dunk in transition to trigger more boos.\n\n\u201cA lot of teams run out [in transition] on us.

Oumallal is Muslim and Gumerman is Jewish, but both were raised in Morocco.\n\nThen there were her neighbors: a Jewish couple from Amsterdam and a Christian couple \u2014 Anne Curtis and Tim Clark \u2014 who has lived in the neighborhood for more than four decades.\n\nFor Curtis, the dinner was an extension of the Pittsburgh concept of \u201cnebby,\u201d local slang that means \u201cnosy,\u201d but also conveys a sense of concern for neighbors. In the days since the shooting, she has been calling and texting neighbors to ensure they were safe.\n\n\u201cThe core is we take care of each other,\u201d Curtis said.\n\nGumerman began Shabbat by lighting a dozen yahrzeit candles, one for each of the victims and a 12th for those who were still in the hospital. The candles are normally lit on the anniversary of the death of loved ones, but Gumerman wanted a way to commemorate the victims this past week.\n\n\n\nGumerman enjoys the company of her friends as they gather to celebrate the Shabbat at her home on Friday.

The synagogue sits less than a mile up the road from Tree of Life, and it has taken in people from all three congregations that held services there.\n\n[The lives lost in the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting]\n\nThey included congregants who rarely attend services and non-Jews, who answered the call from their own faith communities to attend services in solidarity of Jewish Pittsburghers.\n\n\u201cTonight, I really want to keep my mouth shut,\u201d Rabbi Jonathan Perlman of New Light, one of the congregations that held services at Tree of Life, told the congregants Friday night. \u201cBecause there are no words.\u201d\n\nInstead, the rabbi invited them to come to the front of the sanctuary to share their favorite memories of the victims and offer words of strength. One man said he dressed up in memory of victim Melvin Wax, who was known for dressing formally even for casual services. They recalled his fondness of telling jokes and his acumen with Hebrew.\n\n\n\nPeople line both sides of the street as they gather outside Tree of Life synagogue for a service on Saturday in Pittsburgh.

Shortly before 10 a.m., the tearful crowd \u2014 Red Cross volunteers were on hand distributing tissues \u2014 held a moment of silence to mark the week anniversary of the first call to 911, made by a rabbi hiding in the choir loft.\n\nAt Beth Shalom, the sound of weeping could be heard during services. There were prayers for the dead, the wounded and the physically unscathed \u2014 those who may have escaped the gunfire inside the building or regulars who happened to not be there that morning.\n\nWhile congregants prayed to God, they also appealed to politicians to strengthen gun control laws.\n\n\u201cOur theology is that God created humans with free will. Humans can choose to do good or evil,\u201d said Beth Kissileff, the wife of Rabbi Jonathan Perlman, during an emotional speech.\n\n\u201cOur job is to make sure that those who choose to do evil don\u2019t have access to assault rifles,\u201d Kissileff said, prompting rousing applause from the audience.\n\nCongregants said the Rabbi Jeffrey Myers also addressed his controversial decision to meet with President Trump when he visited the synagogue, saying that he wanted to fight hate with kindness and openness. He said he conveyed his concern about the effect of Trump\u2019s rhetoric directly to him.\n\n[Tree of Life rabbi says he saw a \u2018warm and personal side\u2019 to Trump that surprised him]\n\nFor many who came, the services were a source of comfort and strength, but also deep grief.\n\nJean Rosenthal, 90, was typically the second person to arrive at Tree of Life for Saturday services, but she felt ill last weekend and decided to skip. She said the outpouring of support from all corners of the community \u2014 from refugees and Muslims and strangers \u2014 was uplifting. But her heart ached over the loss of her friends.

The Panthers, meanwhile, moved into first in part by gashing Virginia for 254 rushing yards, 190 coming in the second half, at Scott Stadium.\n\n\u201cThis exposed our weakness, and that\u2019s when we played outside our system,\u201d Cavaliers Coach Bronco Mendenhall said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t play clean enough and didn\u2019t execute well enough to take control of the game.\u201d\n\nIn front of an announced crowd of 36,256, Pitt tailback Darrin Hall rushed for 229 yards and three touchdowns. His final scoring run of 75 yards gave the Panthers a 20-13 lead early in the fourth quarter.\n\nPitt (5-4, 4-1) botched the extra point attempt, but Alex Kessman\u2019s 53-yard field goal produced the final margin with 4:25 to play.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very tough to lose the way we did and to lose at home,\u201d Virginia linebacker Charles Snowden said. \u201cIt hurts a lot.\u201d\n\n[Bryce Perkins of Virginia says he got his moves from Dad \u2013 and from dodging trouble with Mom]\n\nInjuries plagued the Cavaliers (6-3, 4-2) throughout, leaving the defense without four starters for portions of the second half. Penalties added to the Cavaliers\u2019 woes \u2014 they were flagged 10 times for 80 yards.\n\nAlready playing without ailing linebacker Robert Snyder, Virginia lost senior safety Juan Thornhill in the first half and defensive end Mandy Alonso and safety Joey Blount, both sophomores, in the third quarter.\n\nSophomore De\u2019Vante Cross replaced Thornhill, and freshman Aaron Famui took over for Alonso. Blount had to be helped off the field with two minutes left in the third quarter favoring his right leg, replaced by sophomore Nick Grant.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very tough when it comes to depth, playmaking and all those things,\u201d junior linebacker Jordan Mack said. \u201cBut it just has to be the next man up mentality.\u201d\n\nThe shorthanded unit provided little resistance on the Panthers\u2019 go-ahead scoring drive of 84 yards on 15 plays over 8:40 in the third quarter. Hall rumbled into the end zone from two yards with Cross wrapped around his waist to give Pitt a 14-10 advantage just before the period expired.\n\nFor the Panthers, the game was less than one week after 11 people were killed when a gunman opened fire at Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh\u2019s Squirrel Hill neighborhood Saturday morning.\n\nPlayers wore \u201cPittsburgh Strong\u201d helmet stickers during Friday night\u2019s game in honor of the victims of the attack, believed to be the deadliest against the Jewish community in U.S. history, according to the Anti-Defamation League.\n\nThe tragedy struck an all too familiar tone with many Virginia players who were finishing practice when they learned of the violence stemming from a Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville on Aug. 12, 2017. Later that afternoon, a man drove a car into a crowd of counter protesters, killing Heather Heyer and injuring 19 others.\n\nBefore Friday\u2019s game, members of the Virginia alumni association handed out \u201cWe Stand With Pittsburgh\u201d stickers instead of its usual buttons supporting the Cavaliers. Then immediately before the national anthem there was a moment of silence.\n\nPitt played its game last Saturday, beating Duke, 54-45, at Heinz Field only hours following the shooting at Tree of Life, which is roughly two miles from the school\u2019s campus in the city\u2019s Oakland neighborhood.\n\nThe Cavaliers held Pitt mostly in check in the first half and took a 10-7 lead into the locker room courtesy of Brian Delaney\u2019s 29-yard field goal with one second left in the second quarter. The drive included a targeting penalty assessed to Panthers defensive end Patrick Jones II with six seconds to go.\n\nThe only turnover of the half belonged to Pitt, which had given up a pass on fourth and three that would have resulted in a first down. But safety Dennis Briggs ripped the ball loose from Virginia tight end Evan Butts, and the Panthers took over at their 21 with 14:55 left in the second quarter.\n\nThe turnover didn\u2019t yield any points, however, after Virginia forced a punt when Snowden sacked quarterback Kenny Pickett on third and 10.\n\nMonsoon-like conditions in the opening minutes of the first quarter made footing an adventure for both teams, but the Panthers assembled a scoring drive on their opening possession as rain moved out of the area. Hall provided the touchdown on a 41-yard inside run with 6:09 to go.\n\nBut on Virginia\u2019s first snap on the ensuing series, quarterback Bryce Perkins completed a 42-yard pass to Terrell Jana down the right sideline for the tying touchdown. The sophomore wide receiver beat Phil Campbell III on the deep route and went untouched into the end zone.\n\nPerkins, who was sacked five times, was impressed by the Pittsburgh defense.\n\n\u201cThey were physical,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir safeties came down hard. But, I mean, ultimately it\u2019s on us.

(Nick Wass/Associated Press)\n\nDwight Howard looked straight ahead, never letting on whether he could hear the hisses.\n\nJust one half into his regular season debut, Howard was experiencing what it\u2019s like to be a Washington Wizards player in the 2018-19 season.\n\nOn Friday night, Howard started the game with celebration, coaxing cheers out of the Capital One Arena crowd. After throwing down a two-handed dunk while being fouled in the opening moments of the Wizards\u2019 matchup against the Oklahoma City Thunder, Howard pointed both index fingers to the ceiling. The fans roared because they hadn\u2019t seen a Wizards big man make a play like that all season.\n\nBut that moment was fleeting \u2014 and the Wizards still had to go downcourt and play defense. The team\u2019s effort on that end has a way of twisting adoration into emphatic boos. By halftime, Howard kept his eyes fixed on the tunnel \u2014 just as his teammates did \u2014 while walking off the home floor under a hail of taunts.\n\nWhile Howard provided a glimpse of what the team had been missing from its starting center, evident by that first play and his 20 points on 7-for-8 shooting, his first action with the Wizards ended with a 134-111 loss.\n\nEven with the 6-foot-11 Howard patrolling the middle, the \u00adWizards could not stop the Thunder. The spiraling Wizards (1-7), who dropped their fifth straight, still looked irreparable on the defensive end.\n\n[Downward spiral continues for Wizards in blowout loss to Thunder]\n\nSomehow, the Thunder (4-4), playing on the second night of a back-to-back set, had fresh legs to hit 15 three-pointers and connect on 57 percent from the field.\n\nHoward played 23 minutes because the game was out of hand by the fourth quarter, and he pulled down just three rebounds.\n\n\u201cI thought we had a good start. Obviously, Dwight was a bright spot,\u201d Coach Scott Brooks said. \u201cPlayed extremely well for his first game. It\u2019s good to see. We were hoping he\u2019d come in and set the tone, and I thought he did.\u201d\n\nHoward was the team\u2019s most efficient threat on offense, and before the game he couldn\u2019t stay still, like an anxious player trying to squeeze a season\u2019s worth of pregame rituals into a few minutes.\n\nShortly after the national anthem, Howard began tossing layups to himself off the backboard. Then he left the court and walked to the front row of seats behind the bench, remembering that he needed to stretch his calves. All the while a song by Migos repeated the question of the night: \u201cIs you ready?\u201d\n\nHoward might have displayed restless energy, but he looked more than ready for his first game in six months. That first play, when the Wizards\u2019 floor balance and ball movement created an easy dunk, also marked the first time in some time that Howard unleashed his leaping ability in front of a crowd.\n\nHoward very well might have dunked during closed-door practices with team staffers or even with his two personal trainers as he rehabilitated from a piriformis injury. But Howard, a former Slam Dunk champion, said leaping only recently returned to his repertoire.\n\n\u201cLast week I wasn\u2019t really able to jump as much,\u201d he said Thursday. \u201cNow I\u2019m able to get a little bit higher than I did, so it\u2019s going to keep progressing. I think that was the biggest thing I was trying to get back \u2014 just my legs.\u201d\n\nHoward saved his jumps at the end of the team\u2019s morning shoot-around, and instead he worked on his spot-up corner threes. Though Howard joked around and photobombed an actor from the \u201cCreed\u201d sequel \u2014 the movie\u2019s director and lead villain were invited to attend the Wizards\u2019 practice session \u2014 he took his three-pointers seriously.\n\n\u201cAre you shooting?\u201d Howard asked teammate Kelly Oubre Jr., who was standing idly to his left. \u201cSo can you get out the way so I can shoot?\u201d\n\nWith teammates out of his way, Howard hurled more threes. He kept shooting during a private session with trainers Ed Downs and Justin Zormelo. He was still launching an hour before tip-off.\n\nYet when the game started, Howard gave up his dream of playing as a stretch five and committed himself to the interior. During his opening nine minutes, he rolled to the rim for three dunks. His first prompted fans to believe again, that maybe when Howard pointed to the sky, that meant things were looking up.\n\nThey weren\u2019t. By the end of the fourth quarter, Howard, who said he still feels pain from his buttocks muscle strain, was flat on his back near the sideline.", "An Idaho superintendent has issued a public apology and placed 14 employees on paid administrative leave after staff at a public elementary school dressed up as Mexicans and a border wall for Halloween.\n\nThe images began circulating on social media this week, and they depict more than a dozen adults dressed up in two groups at Middleton Heights Elementary School, in a town of about 7,500 located 30 miles west of Boise.

We celebrated our RESPECT character winners, single and double marathon runners.\u201d\n\nThe Halloween incident is another data entry in the long list of controversial, racially insensitive or historically ignorant costumes that inevitably get trotted out every year.

Turns out it was also based on a falsehood.]\n\nTwelve advocacy organizations, including the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s chapter in the state, sent a letter to the district expressing concern about the costumes, the Statesman reported.\n\n\u201cRegardless of the intent of a teacher\u2019s actions in the classroom, we must focus on and give weight to the impact of such actions on the students who rely on teachers and other school officials for guidance and support throughout their educational experience,\u201d the ACLU of Idaho said in a statement. \u201cSchool districts, their staff and other agents have obligations under federal law, state law, and district policies to prevent and protect students, staff, and others from discrimination, bullying, intimidation, and harassment.\u201d\n\nThe Idaho Human Rights Commission, a state governing body, also weighed in on Friday night.\n\n\u201cDiscrimination under these acts can occur when an employer or school allows a hostile environment to exist against persons because of their race, sex and national origin,\u201d the commission said in a statement, according to the Idaho Press. \u201cSimply because conduct takes place as a so-called joke does not excuse otherwise unlawful conduct.\u201d\n\nThe school did not identify the staff members who wore the costumes.\n\nAbout 13 percent of the students at the elementary school are Latino, according to data from Idaho Ed Trends.\n\nRead more:\n\nRep.

On Nov. 2, the U.S. Supreme Court refused a federal government request to disallow the lawsuit. (Andy Nelson/AP)\n\nThe Supreme Court on Friday night refused to halt a novel lawsuit filed by young Americans that attempts to force the federal government to take action on climate change, turning down a request from the Trump administration to stop it before trial.\n\nThe suit, filed in 2015 by 21 young people who argue that the failure of government leaders to combat climate change violates their constitutional right to a clean environment, is before a federal judge in Oregon. It had been delayed while the Supreme Court considered the emergency request from the government.\n\nJustices Clarence Thomas and Neil M. Gorsuch would have stopped the suit. The other justices did not indicate how they voted on the government\u2019s request.\n\nThe court\u2019s three-page order said the government should seek relief from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit. It noted the government\u2019s assertion that the \u201csuit is based on an assortment of unprecedented legal theories, such as a substantive due process right to certain climate conditions, and an equal protection right to live in the same climate as enjoyed by prior generations.\u201d\n\nThe justices acknowledged that the 9th Circuit had previously turned down the government but said those decisions came when there was a \u201clikelihood that plaintiffs\u2019 claims would narrow as the case progressed.\u201d That no longer seems the case, the unsigned opinion said, suggesting the possibility that the 9th Circuit might see things differently now.\n\nAnd it left open the possibility that the government could return to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe goal of the lawsuit is to compel the government to scale back its support for fossil fuel extraction and production and to support policies aimed at reducing the greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global warming.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been confident throughout this case that we would get to trial, and I believe we will get to trial,\u201d Julia Olson, the attorney for the youths and executive director of Our Children\u2019s Trust, said in an interview with The Washington Post on Friday evening. \u201cWe have overcome everything the government has thrown at us.

But he said the unique nature of the lawsuit deserved such an exception.\n\nIf the long trial were allowed to proceed, \u201cit could well be years into the future\u201d before the government could \u201cseek relief from such an egregious abuse of the civil litigation process and violation of the separation of powers.\u201d\n\nThe government has made similar arguments in lower courts, but time and again, judges allowed the case to proceed. The government also went to the Supreme Court this summer seeking a stay, but the court in an unsigned opinion called the request \u201cpremature.\u201d\n\nIn a 103-page filing this week intended to keep the trial on track, the plaintiffs argued that the Trump administration would not suffer \u201cirreparable\u201d harm in having to go through with the case.\n\n\u201cThis case clearly poses profoundly important constitutional questions, including questions about individual liberty and standing, the answers to which depend upon the full evaluation of evidence at trial,\u201d the lawyers wrote, adding: \u201cThese young plaintiffs, mere children and youth, are already suffering irreparable harm which worsens as each day passes with more carbon dioxide accumulating in the atmosphere and oceans.\u201d\n\nThe young activists also used the chance to once again demand that the courts compel the government to \u201ccease their violation of plaintiffs\u2019 rights, prepare an accounting of the nation\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions, and prepare and implement an enforceable national remedial plan to cease the constitutional violations by phasing out fossil fuel emissions and drawing down atmospheric CO2.\u201d\n\nOlson said the youth plaintiffs were filing a request with the district court in Oregon for a hearing soon in hopes of moving toward the long-awaited trial.\n\nOfficials at the Department of Justice could not be reached immediately for comment Friday.", "Georgia must change its procedures to make it easier for some people flagged under the state\u2019s restrictive \u201cexact match\u201d law to vote, a federal judge ruled Friday, dealing a blow to Republican gubernatorial candidate and Secretary of State Brian Kemp.\n\nThe \u201cexact match\u201d law flags voter registrations that are found to have discrepancies, such as a dropped hyphen, with other official identifications.
