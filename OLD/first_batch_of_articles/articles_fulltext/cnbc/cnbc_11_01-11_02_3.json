Because if a stock can rally when everything's falling apart, imagine what it can do when the dust settles.\"\n\nSince CEO Steve Easterbrook took the helm of the fast-food chain, he's revamped the menu, introduced delivery via a partnership with Uber Eats and begun a store remodeling program aimed at attracting customers.\n\nCramer, a big Easterbrook fan, said the moves have paid off in droves and have extended the runway for both the company and its stock.\n\n\"Here's the bottom line on this remarkable story: We know McDonald's is firing on all cylinders, and this company has no need to worry about the trade war or the Federal Reserve, which is why its stock could go higher today when the rest of the market was pulling back,\" he said. \"I think McDonald's has a lot more room to run.\"", "Few companies have the capacity to take on Foursquare, a location discovery platform that leverages its massive database to provide users with personalized recommendations, Foursquare CEO Jeff Glueck said Friday.\n\n\"Other than Google and Facebook, we are the Switzerland,\" Glueck said in an exclusive \"Mad Money\" interview with CNBC's Jim Cramer.\n\n\"We are the sort of platform that everyone who's not Google or Facebook want to use because we understand the whole world's places and we understand different floors of buildings, where you go in malls,\" he continued. \"It's very hard technology, and so really only Google, Facebook and Foursquare have this precision globally.\"\n\nSince Foursquare broke into the big data space, the company has used its deep data to help other companies enhance their location-based technology. Its latest ventures include partnerships with Liberty Media's TripAdvisor and dating app Tinder.\n\n\"The business is 99 percent about helping other brands reach their audiences at scale,\" Glueck told Cramer. \"People think, maybe, 'I don't use Foursquare anymore,' ... but if you tag a tweet on Twitter, if you get a geofilter on Snapchat, if you participate in Tinder Places, these are all services that we are helping create with our technology.\"\n\nWith Tinder Places, which is being piloted in three cities, Foursquare suggests matching with people who frequent similar locales, like dog parks and coffee shops. Glueck said early results are already showing \"better matches,\" because \"people have something in common and so they're more reciprocal.\"\n\nWithout naming names, the CEO also took a stance on data protection and the importance of keeping users in control when it comes to using Foursquare's location services.\n\n\"For different people, opting into location sharing or sharing your payments, like Venmo Friends allows, that's something that's very personal,\" he said. \"For us, it's always been the user has to be in control. The user has to have adequate chance to opt in and know how it's going to benefit them, and that's how we work with companies. And so what we see is about 50 to 70 percent of people opt in to these enhanced location alerts.\"\n\nFoursquare is a privately-traded company with over 100 million logged locations in 200 countries.

How are you going to get social change? The biggest way is there's a $19 trillion private economy.\"\n\nFour times the size of the public sector and 40 times the size of the philanthropic sector, the private sector should bear a greater burden to tackle wealth disparity and other \"social fissures and ruptures,\" the billionaire said.\n\n\"You've got half the country left behind,\" he said. \"The way that you change things is that you've got to first go to the American people, and that's what we did. We said, 'What is it that you want to see that defines corporate justness?'\"\n\nThat question brought on the birth of Just Capital, which ranks companies based on qualities it defines as the priorities of U.S. consumers, including worker pay and treatment. The organization just rolled out an exchange-traded fund with the top 50 percent of companies in its rankings by industry, which, on average, earn 7 percent higher returns on equity than their less \"just\" counterparts in the Russell 1000 index, Jones told Cramer.\n\nEven so, social discrepancies persist, and some of them threaten business as we know it, he said.\n\n\"Five years ago, it was apparent even then, I think, that capitalism needed to be modernized,\" Jones told Cramer. \"I just saw this poll \u2013 51 percent of millennials from 18 to 29 either don't believe or [are] opposed to capitalism.\"\n\n\"Your show's going to have a viewership of about 15 in about 10 or 15 years,\" he joked. \"Now, we've got to change this.\"", "Apple's management may have botched the way it announced a change to its earnings reporting, but investors shouldn't give up on the company's stock, CNBC's Jim Cramer said Friday.\n\nIn the announcement, the iPhone maker said it would stop breaking down the sales results for its individual products.\n\n\"My advice now is to let this stock settle down. Give the sellers who don't believe [CEO] Tim Cook's explanation a couple more days to get out. Then, if you don't own it, I'd start buying it,\" the \"Mad Money\" host and longtime Apple bull advised. \"Remember, Apple has the world's biggest buyback and next week I bet you they will be in there repurchasing this stock right alongside you.\"\n\nShares of Apple slid 6.63 percent on Friday after falling in Thursday's after-hours trading. Wall Street analysts took issue with Apple's decision to stop issuing individual product results and the company's muted forecast, which was tied to timing issues related to its new iPhones.\n\nBut Cramer said he didn't blame Apple for its decision to stop breaking down its product results and reiterated his call to value the Cupertino-based giant as a consumer products company rather than a technology hardware provider.\n\n\"As I told you earlier, I still believe you should own Apple, not trade it,\" he said. \"I regard Apple as the greatest consumer packaged goods play on earth \u2014 like a better version of Procter & Gamble \u2014 and you don't see Procter & Gamble giving you the number of Gillette razors it sells every quarter.\"", "CNBC's Jim Cramer wants investors to be prepared for the week ahead after days of news-driven swings in the stock market.\n\n\"This market punishes you for having too much conviction,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said on Friday. \"When we get too negative, we're blindsided by positive developments. When we get too optimistic, we get hit with days like today. I bet next week gives us more of the same.\"\n\nCramer pointed to some recent intraday swings: on Friday, stocks opened higher after a report saying President Donald Trump had requested his cabinet members to prepare for a trade deal with China.\n\nShortly thereafter, Trump's chief economic advisor, Larry Kudlow, refuted that story on CNBC, sending the market lower. Then, Trump reiterated his optimism and stocks started climbing again, at least until a positive employment report seemingly renewed the need for the Federal Reserve to combat inflation with more interest rate hikes.\n\n\"It was all very confusing,\" Cramer said. \"I'm just surprised we didn't go down even more, especially since Apple's stock got eviscerated ... even though the company reported an upside surprise.\"\n\nBut even though shares of Apple continued their slide on Friday, the \"Mad Money\" host stood by the stock, saying that Apple will be \"buying back boatloads of its stock next week\" and advising investors to \"join in.\"\n\nWith that in mind, here's his game plan for the week ahead:", "12 Hours Ago\n\nThe DOJ has apparently prepared to indict Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, setting up a legal battle that could have broad ramifications for the Russia probe as well as the government's prosecution of journalists and others who reveal secrets.", "Apple avalanche sending a warning to all of tech?\n\n5:45 PM ET Fri, 2 Nov 2018\n\nThe Nasdaq heavyweights get shredded.

At some point, they're going to stop.\"\n\nOn \"Mad Money,\" Jones said he uses the 1999-2000 dotcom bubble and the financial crisis as references when faced with the question of whether stocks could enter a bear market.\n\n\"If we just think about the stock market, when everyone says 'What do you think about the stock market? Are we going to go into a bear market?' ... I go back and I think about the '99-2000 top, the '06-'07 tops,\" he said. \"So, in 2000, when they stopped [raising rates], the market went back and re-tested the old highs.\"\n\nThe stock market has seen increased volatility since the Fed's most recent rate hike in late September. Shortly after the hike, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said interest rates were \"a long way\" from neutral, meaning neither accommodation nor restrictive to U.S. economic growth.\n\n\"I think you'll have a chance to see the old highs revisited if and when and before we go into a bear market,\" Jones said. \"I'm thinking through the end of the tightening cycle, the pause, the excitement around that pause, and then I think, boy, then you've got to pay attention. Then you've got to pay attention. We'll probably rally after whenever they finish [tightening].

Throughout the Trump presidency, Republicans have hemorrhaged support from white college graduates, especially women.\n\nFor those voters, Republican leaders highlight fear for their pocketbooks. That means warnings of Democratic tax increases and, more ominously, seizure of private property from the rich.\n\nLast month, the White House Council of Economic Advisers issued a report highlighting \"The Opportunity Costs of Socialism.\" Invoking Lenin's Russia, Mao's China and Castro's Cuba, it likened Democratic criticism of the gap between rich and poor to Marxism.\n\nThe twin assertion of cultural and economic threats makes an oddly dystopian message for a time of strong economic growth. With America's recovery from recession and financial crisis in its ninth year, Friday's strong employment report showed rising wages and labor force participation in addition to 250,000 new jobs.\n\nIn 1984, President Ronald Reagan fashioned similar data into an upbeat \"Morning in America\" re-election campaign. But 21st century Republicans have not, for reasons that go beyond Trump's truculent personality.\n\nThe continuing march of income inequality undercuts broad appeals to prosperity. Candidate Trump recognized the issue's potency with his vow to eliminate special tax breaks for the rich, such as \"carried interest\" for financial executives that he accused of \"getting away with murder.\"\n\nDuring the Obama presidency, such proposals for higher taxes on the wealthy terrified Wall Street. \"It's like when Hitler invaded Poland in 1939,\" Blackstone's Stephen Schwarzman complained in 2010.\n\nBut with Republicans controlling Congress and the White House, Schwarzman had little to fear. The Trump/GOP tax cut did not eliminate carried interest. It delivered the greatest benefits to the wealthy.", "Starbucks fans may need to scour several locations if they want to find the cafe's new reusable red cup.\n\nCoffee drinkers took to Twitter on Friday to complain that they were having trouble securing the elusive new cup at their local stores and had to resort to going to a number of different locations before finding one.\n\n\"We are seeing an enthusiastic response to the return of Holiday beverages and cups at Starbucks as well as today's limited-edition giveaway of our reusable red holiday cup, which is available while supplies last,\" Starbucks told CNBC. \"Each store has a limited supply, and we're aware that some stores are already running out.\"\n\nOn Friday, the company launched its holiday beverages and cups with a special reusable red cup.

Another said the cups sold out around 3 p.m. and wouldn't be available until more were sent to the store in a few days.\n\nEarlier on Friday, Starbucks' Reward Members were unable to place their orders, as the app was failing to recognize store locations and wouldn't take orders.\n\nWATCH: There are basically no Starbucks on this continent.

The removals took place in late September and early October.\n\nThe number of accounts removed is modest, considering that Twitter has previously deleted millions of accounts it determined were responsible for spreading misinformation in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n\nYet the removals represent an early win for a fledgling effort by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, or DCCC, a party group that supports Democrats running for the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nThe DCCC launched the effort this year in response to the party's inability to respond to millions of accounts on Twitter and other social media platforms that spread negative and false information about Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and other party candidates in 2016, three people familiar with the operation told Reuters.", "President Donald Trump once said, \"Black people are too stupid to vote for me\" and suggested that all countries run by blacks are \"s---holes,\" Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen says in a new bombshell interview.\n\nAlso in the Vanity Fair interview, Cohen said he once was traveling to Chicago with Trump in the late 2000s, \"we drove through what looked like a rougher neighborhood.\"\n\n\"Trump made a comment to me, saying that only the blacks could live like this,\" Cohen recalled in the article, entitled \"Michael Cohen says Trump Repeatedly Used Racist Language Before His Presidency.\"\n\nAnd Cohen said that when he and Trump once talked about the first season of Trump's reality show \"The Apprentice,\" the president was \"explaining his back-and-forth about not picking\" Kwame Jackson, a black investment manager as the winner.\n\n\"There's no way I can let this black f-g win,\" Trump said, according to Cohen's account.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.

Last month, he hosted entrepreneur and music star Kanye West and football hall-of-famer Jim Brown at the White House. During that visit, West rejected the notion that Trump, who has a history of making incendiary comments about race, doesn't deserve the support of minorities.\n\n\"A liberal would try to control a black person through the concept of racism, because we know we're very proud emotional people,\" West said. \"So when I said I like Trump to like someone who is liberal, they'll say, 'Oh, but he's racist.'

According to the most recent Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), American workers are quitting at the highest rate since 2001. It's a trend that can be seen across all age and wage brackets, including those who earn six figures.\n\nConfidence in the labor market is sky-high thanks to a low national unemployment rate of just 3.7 percent. In fact, workers are feeling so sure of themselves that when Ladders surveyed more than 50,000 workers earning over six figures, they found that 67 percent see themselves quitting in the next six months and 35.4 percent would actually quit a job they didn't like without another job lined up.\n\n\"The job market swings every decade between fear and greed. Currently, with more than one job open for each unemployed person, professionals have their pick of jobs to choose among,\" Ladders CEO Marc Cenedella tells CNBC Make It. \"Very favorable employment markets, and a sense that your pot of gold is just over the rainbow, are leading many Americans to have great confidence [in] their ability to make it their own way.\"\n\nIt's a gamble, but it could pay off in the current labor market. Brian Kropp, vice president at research firm Gartner, says that quitting might be workers' best chance to snatch that \"pot of gold\" that Cenedella describes.\n\nAccording to Kropp, the average increase in compensation for a worker who quits their old job for a new one in today's tight labor market is about 15 percent. \"You're never going to get that 15 percent [increase] by staying at your current job,\" he tells CNBC Make It. \"That's just not going to happen.\"", "User traffic growth has been robust, says Alibaba's Joe Tsai 9:31 AM ET Fri, 2 Nov 2018 | 04:44\n\nAn all-out trade war between the world's two largest economies would hurt the U.S. stock market and thousands of American companies that do business in China, Alibaba co-founder Joseph Tsai told CNBC on Friday.\n\n\"Nobody wants to have a trade war and that's because China and the United States are very symbiotic in terms of the economic relationship,\" the Alibaba executive vice chairman said.\n\nChina buys about $200 billion in goods and services from the U.S., Tsai said on \"Squawk on the Street,\" estimating about 68,000 U.S. companies do business in China, generating about $600 billion in revenue and $40 billion in profits.\n\n\"If that all gets shut off, I think you'll see that reflected in the stock market in the Unites States,\" he argued, ahead of White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow shooting down a report that a China deal was in the works.\n\nHowever, Kudlow said President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping do plan to meet at the G-20 summit later this month and discuss trade.\n\nThus far, the impasse between Washington and Beijing has seen both sides enacting import tariffs against each other, with Trump recently threatening levies on the rest China's imports.\n\nDespite the trade overhang, Alibaba's Tsai said Chinese consumers are feeling pretty good. \"We think the consumers are still fundamentally healthy because ... over the last years, they have a lot of savings.\"\n\n\"Where we see a little bit of, maybe, hesitation to move is in the consumer durables; heavy ticket items like cars and heavy consumer electronics,\" he argued after the firm reported mixed quarterly results. \"But we think that's a cyclical thing.\"\n\nBefore the bell on Friday, China-based Alibaba reported lower-than-expected quarterly revenue, another sign of slowing momentum for the e-commerce giant's platforms and the Chinese economy.\n\nAlibaba shares, under some pressure on Wall Street on Friday, has dropped about 12 percent for the year on concerns about the impact of the U.S.-China tariffs. Alibaba has a stock market value of around $380 billion.\n\nGil Luria, director of research at D.A. Davidson, recently told CNBC that Alibaba represents a \"compelling investment in the Chinese consumer as the Chinese economy becomes ever more focused on consumption growth.\"\n\n\"[But] if this conflict persists and exports from China to the U.S. diminish, the Chinese economy could slow, dampening consumption and thus putting Alibaba's core business at risk,\" Luria said.\n\n\u2014 Reuters contributed to this report.", "HBO isn't happy that President Donald Trump used \"Game of Thrones\" imagery and language to promote sanctions against Iran.\n\nAn image of Trump posted Friday featured a text overlay reading \"Sanctions are coming.\" The font of the text is a near-match of the style used in HBO's mega-popular fantasy television series. The text itself appears to imitate \"Winter is coming,\" one of the show's most popular slogans.\n\nIn a statement to CNBC, HBO said, \"We were not aware of this messaging and would prefer our trademark not be misappropriated for political purposes.\"\n\nHBO's official Twitter account followed up soon after, asking, \"How do you say trademark misuse in Dothraki?\" referring to a fictional language used by one of the groups in the show.\n\nAsked if HBO planned to take legal action, network spokesman Jeff Cusson told CNBC there were \"no further steps.\"\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on HBO's statement.\n\nIt was not immediately clear from Trump's tweet which sanctions he was referring to. But the White House's official Twitter account appeared to clarify in a follow-up shortly after Trump's tweet that the image was intended to reference sanctions on Iran.\n\nTrump's tweet also noted that the sanctions were \"coming\" on Monday, Nov. 5, when the administration says it will reimpose all U.S. sanctions on Iran that had been relaxed under the 2015 nuclear deal brokered during the Obama administration.\n\nThis isn't the first time Trump has run afoul of HBO's parent company, Time Warner.

We're actually high-conviction underweight. And quite frankly, this isn't a place you'd want to hide in a trade war, since 90 percent of the sector's revenues come from overseas, which is higher than any other sector,\" Mark Tepper, president and CEO of Strategic Wealth Partners, said Thursday on CNBC's \"Trading Nation.\"\n\nTepper is of the mind that the group as a whole has gotten far ahead of itself, rallying 76 percent in the last three years. But he's bullish on a select few names like Nvidia for its exposure to the gaming industry specifically. That stock is up a whopping 650 percent in three years, but has plunged 25 percent in the past month.\n\nSemiconductor stocks have indeed gotten trapped in the U.S.-China trade war's crosshairs, and other headwinds plague the industry. Shares of Advanced Micro Devices, for example, plunged last month after the company reported revenue guidance that fell below Wall Street's estimates.\n\nOther strategists agree that investors may want to play the semiconductor space highly selectively, rather than buying up a broad vehicle like the semiconductor-tracking SMH ETF.\n\nTwo names investors might consider are Taiwan Semiconductor and Marvell, said Stacey Gilbert, head of derivative strategy at Susquehanna, pointing to the firm's equity analysts' recommendations.\n\n\"This is certainly not a sector-based trade. In fact, our analysts Mehdi Hosseini and Chris Rolland are still certainly cautious on this sector. We certainly wouldn't just be looking to buy the basket, if you will.

The EBA said in findings published on their website that all 48 banks beat the common tier ratio of 5.5 percent under adverse stress.\n\nBritish bank Barclays ranked lowest in the test, scoring a common tier ratio of just 6.37 percent in the adverse scenario. Fellow U.K. bank Lloyds also performed poorly with a score of 6.8 percent. Commenting after the results, the Bank Of England said the results showed that U.K. banks could absorb the effect of the EBA's worst scenario.\n\nEurope's biggest bank, Deutsche Bank, performed better than some forecasters had predicted, registering a core tier of 8.14 percent, again in an adverse scenario.\n\nEBA said under their adverse scenario, the capital depletion across the banks at the end of 2020 was 236 billion euros ($268 billion) and 226 billion euros on a \"transitional and fully loaded basis respectively.\"\n\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) added that the EBA test showed that banks in Europe were now \"more resilient to financial shocks.\"\n\nItalian banks were also under scrutiny but managed to record satisfactory scores according to banking regulators. Unicredit, Italy's largest lender, scored a common tier ratio of 9.34 while UBI Banca scored 7.42 percent. The lowest score among Italian banks was for Banco BPM which registered 6.67 percent.\n\nThe assessment was carried out by placing the bank's end of 2017 balance sheet figures and seeing how they would stand up to the strain of what the EBA describes as \"adverse market developments.\"\n\nTheoretical markets shocks such as a disorderly Brexit or sudden sell-off in property were used as scenarios to examine the bank's balance sheets. Although there was no pass or fail mark given, the key metric being used is a banks' core tier ratio.\n\nTier 1 capital ratio is the ratio of a bank's core equity capital to its total risk-weighted assets. More simply, it's the level of reserve funding that a bank can call on to mitigate against sudden shocks or losses.\n\nIn its tests, the banks are benchmarked against a core tier ratio \u2014 8% in the baseline scenario and 5.5% in the adverse scenario. Any figure near to, or below 5.5% is likely to give investors cause for concern.\n\nLeading up to the results, banks in Italy were in focus, due to their high level of non-performing loans (NPLs). The EBA said in an earlier report that the ratio of NPLs in Italy was 9.7 percent during the second quarter, almost three times higher than the European average.", "The MAGA trade: 4 moves\n\n1:00 PM ET Fri, 2 Nov 2018\n\nThe \"Fast Money\" traders give 4 ways to trade the MAGA stocks.", "In the biggest U.S. cities, the income you need to afford to buy a home varies greatly.

She started her own business three years ago, helping small business owners and elderly clients manage their finances. That's when she turned to the Obamacare exchanges for health coverage.\n\n\"I was fortunate enough, because I was just starting my business, to get a subsidy \u2026 and it was pretty good insurance\" for about $300 a month, said the owner of Professional Paperwork Services in Lawrenceville, New Jersey.\n\nBut as her business improved, her insurance options changed last year.\n\n\"I didn't get the subsidy anymore, because my business went well,\" Sobin explained. So, she switched plans to \"the least expensive one I could get \u2014 and it was $750 a month.\"\n\nWith the Nov. 1 start of 2019 open enrollment on the Affordable Care Act exchanges, the New Jersey native says it looks like she may have to change coverage again.\n\n\"My same plan looks like it's going to be about $150 more per month\" in 2019, or $900, she said.\n\nYet, she may find savings if she switches plans again. President Donald Trump's administration says on average prices for 2019 are 1.5 percent lower than they were last year on the federal health exchange, healthcare.gov.\n\nAfter years of regulatory uncertainty which led to double-digit price hikes on exchange plans, health insurers are starting to turn a profit on the ACA exchanges. For 2019, there are more carriers getting back into the market and offering new plan options.\n\n\"Our view is (that) the marketplace for the individual exchange business is more competitive in 2019 than it has been ... there's more competitors entering the space,\" said Cigna CEO David Cordani on the company's earnings conference call Thursday.\n\nCigna is expanding its exchange footprint to a seventh state for 2019, returning to the Arizona market and saying that it is on track to make a profit on its ACA plans this year.\n\nSix-year-old start-up Oscar Health is also expanding into Arizona, and will be offering plans in Michigan and Florida for the first time, bringing its exchange footprint to nine states.\n\n\"This is a special open enrollment for us. We feel great about going into more markets,\" said Oscar CEO Mario Schlosser. \"We increasingly are in the markets that have found stability.\"\n\nA big reason for more stability in the exchange open enrollment was the pause this year in the GOP's legislative push to repeal Obamacare. Still, one big change could prove disruptive during this fall's open enrollment period, which runs through Dec. 15 on the federal exchange.\n\nThe Trump administration extended the length of cheaper, short-term plans with fewer benefits to provide up to 12 months of coverage. Some analysts predict those cheaper plans could attract healthier members.\n\nOnline insurance brokerage eHealth boosted its staffing this fall to help consumers navigate all of the new alternatives. CEO Scott Flanders says for those who receive subsidies, Obamacare remains the best option. But for those who earn too much to qualify for tax credits, the new plans could be a viable alternative.\n\n\"UnitedHealth is coming with some really innovative products for the individual short-term market ... so there's just a lot more choice,\" Flanders said. \"Now, the negative to that is there's more complexity.\"\n\nHe says that will make it even more important for people to shop and compare their options this year. Short-term plans are cheaper because many come with coverage limits and can deny coverage for pre-existing conditions.\n\nSobin says it's important to do your homework. She's glad she did after considering a short-term plan that claimed her doctors would be covered in-network.\n\n\"I called my doctors, and they said they don't take those plans,\" she said. \"It would have been a good savings, but I don't really trust that it would have covered anything.\"\n\nAnother factor that could be disruptive in 2019 is the repeal of the ACA individual mandate penalty. Americans won't have to pay a fine for being uninsured, as a result of the GOP tax plan.\n\nIt could lead to even lower enrollment for younger people, but insurers say they're confident people will still sign up.\n\n\"Members in this market have started to become educated to the point where they realize it isn't just about premiums, it's about the service you get,\" said Schlosser.\n\nPolls show health-care affordability remains a top campaign issue for most Americans.\n\nFlanders says it may be good for the health insurance market if Democrats take the House and the Republicans keep control of the Senate after the midterm elections Tuesday.\n\n\"I don't think it's realistic to expect major legislative change heading into 2019 \u2026 so we think we'll have a more stable environment over the next two years,\" he explained, \"and predictability is good for the private sector, because then they can make plans.\"\n\n\u2014 Follow Bertha Coombs on Twitter: @coombscnbc\n\n", "Larry Lopez, president of construction staffing service Green JobWorks in Baltimore, Maryland, needs about 20 skilled workers \u2014 a tall order for any small employer in a tight labor market.

That broad price range means individual unit sales no longer give a full picture of the strength of the iPhone business. The fact that Apple reported flat iPhone sales along with a significant jump in profitability is proof of that.\n\nThis doesn't mean everything is rosy for Apple. The company also reported light guidance of $89 billion to $93 billion for the holiday quarter, slightly below Wall Street expectations of $93.02 billion. CEO Tim Cook told CNBC's Josh Lipton on Thursday that the timing of new product launches and foreign exchange rates all factored into guidance.\n\nBeyond hardware, Apple will start telling a deeper story around its services business, which generated $9.98 billion during the quarter, up 27 percent from a year ago.\n\nServices includes items like Apple Music subscriptions, App Store sales and iCloud storage subscriptions. It also includes the fees that Google pays Apple to remain the default search engine on the iPhone, which analysts at Bernstein estimate is around $3 billion per year. Apple said it will start reporting margins for its services business, providing more detail on how well it's performing.\n\n\"With increasing disclosure coming for services (gross margin), we believe Apple is simply trying to change the focus towards the overall installed base and services revenue per user,\" Piper Jaffray said in a research note Friday.\n\nCook said on Thursday's earnings call that Apple's installed base is seeing double-digit growth across all devices. That suggests that a meaningful number of first-time iPhone users, including switchers from Android, are buying used devices. Those users don't show up in new iPhone unit sales, but each new user is an opportunity to capture new services revenue. In other words, services grows with the installed base, not just with sales of brand-new phones.\n\nThat's going to be the big story out of New Apple going into next year. The New Apple is no longer just about growing the iPhone user base, but proving that the company can generate more revenue out of each iPhone, iPad and Mac user through subscriptions, digital services and higher prices on hardware.\n\n\u2014 CNBC's Josh Lipton contributed to this report.", "Shares of Starbucks skyrocketed Friday as investors finally see a turnaround taking hold in the U.S.\n\nFor about two years, the coffee chain had lost momentum.

To accomplish this, the company has been offering more cold beverages and new lunch items as well as leveraging its rewards program to entice customers with \"happy hour\" deals.\n\nStarbucks' loyalty program, which accounts for 14 percent of all its transactions, now has 15.3 million members, a 15 percent jump from last year, the company said.

But Britain's government is supportive of the industry and is keen to reduce the country's reliance on imports of natural gas, which is used to heat around 80 percent of Britain's homes.\n\nThe British Geological Survey estimates shale gas resources in northern England alone could contain 1,300 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of gas, 10 percent of which could meet the country's demand for almost 40 years.\n\nCuadrilla which is 47.4 percent owned by Australia's AJ Lucas and 45.2 percent owned by a fund managed by Riverstone, first extracted shale gas in England near the coastal town of Blackpool in the northwest in 2011, but it was stopped after causing a 2.3 magnitude earth tremor.

But if their investigations into the administration or special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe reveal new information, Democrats could pursue it more aggressively.\n\nEven the higher possibility of a Trump impeachment could spark more market volatility.\n\n\"If impeachment proceedings are considered, as they might be today, this would represent a macro 'shock,'\" Song said. \"The market has generally recovered much of the initial sell-off from historical shocks, in many cases due to central bank policy responses. In today's case, one key risk under potential impeachment would be that of reversing tax reform, which has contributed double digit earnings growth to S&P 500 companies.\"\n\nStill, even if the House impeaches Trump, a GOP-controlled Senate likely will not vote to remove him from office.\n\nThe war over health care: On the policy front, Democrats and Republicans may struggle to find common ground. Both parties, including Trump, have stressed the need for an infrastructure overhaul. But since Trump became president, lawmakers have struggled to reach a consensus on exactly what an infrastructure plan would look like and how it would be funded. The situation may not change with split control.\n\nOn health care, Democrats want to shore up the Affordable Care Act to curb rising premiums \u2014 and some want to take even more action to expand the government's role in health care. They may not find common ground with Senate Republicans. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said the GOP could move again to repeal Obamacare if it gains enough Senate seats.\n\nImpact on Big Pharma: While Trump recently unveiled a proposal intended to cut Medicare drug prices, he has shied away from his campaign promise to allow Medicare to negotiate directly with drug companies. Democrats also support that proposal and expressed dismay when Trump appeared to abandon it.\n\nInvestors have already priced in a lack of meaningful drug-price reduction legislation being passed, according to David Kostin, chief U.S. equity strategist at Goldman Sachs. The S&P 500 health care sector has climbed more than 7 percent this year and is one of the best performers of 2018.\n\n\"The performance of Pharma stocks has tracked the prediction market likelihood of a Democratic victory in the House, suggesting investors believe a divided Congress would reduce the likelihood of major regulatory changes regarding drug pricing,\" Kostin said.\n\nSome stocks that could benefit from this scenario are Celgene, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Amgen. Celgene and Regeneron are down for the year, while Amgen is up more than 10 percent for 2018. Kostin included them in Goldman's Government Exposure basket, which is made up of companies with at least 20 percent revenue exposure to government spending.\n\nGains for defense: With Trump and the GOP fixated on boosting defense spending, funding for the Pentagon would also likely go up again with divided control of government. Democratsjust agreed to a Defense Department budget increase for fiscal year 2019.\n\nThis could give defense stocks a boost after the election. The iShares U.S. Aerospace and Defense ET is up more than 4 percent this year, outperforming the S&P 500.", "For a brief moment Friday, there was optimism in the market that the Trump administration was getting closer to a trade deal with China. But administration officials are telling CNBC that there is no indication of an imminent agreement.\n\nOn Friday, a report that said President Donald Trump had asked U.S. officials to prepare a draft trade agreement with China sent the market higher. Then, after it became clear that the reported progress might not materialize, the Dow went negative.\n\nThree senior administration officials told CNBC on Friday that there is no indication of an imminent trade deal, despite some progress being made behind the scenes. Later Friday, Trump's top economic advisor Larry Kudlow told CNBC's \"Halftime Report\" that Trump had not asked his Cabinet to put together a draft trade deal.\n\nAnother senior official said that the president is preparing to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the upcoming G-20 summit in Argentina \u2013 and that includes discussing the potential terms of a deal. But that official cautioned against reading too much into the preparations, noting that there is a standing weekly interagency meeting on trade at the White House to discuss specific policies.\n\nSome investors have stressed the need for caution, noting that the administration's boasts of trade progress are coming just days before the midterm elections. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n\"I think it's maybe temporary, because Tuesday is Election Day,\" said Richard Bernstein, CEO of Richard Bernstein Advisors, Friday on CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\" \"We will see what happens Wednesday.\"\n\nFor his part, the president has made a rhetorical turnaround regarding the trade talks. A week ago, Trump told a crowd at the White House that he had a message for Xi.\n\n\"They want to make a deal so badly. And I said, 'You're not ready yet. No, you're not ready. No.'\" Trump said he told Xi. \"I told him, 'You're not ready.'\" China has blamed the U.S. for escalating trade tensions,\n\nBut just a few days before Election Day, the president changed his tune \u2014 and it seemed to buoy the stock market right on schedule.\n\nJust a day after Kudlow said that the administration has not engaged the Chinese in \"intense talks lately,\" Trump said Thursday that trade discussions \"are moving along nicely.\"\n\nInvestors hopeful for a trade deal are skeptical about the recent change in rhetoric, suggesting it could be heavy on politics and short on policy.\n\n\"In my opinion, will all due respect to the president, he's talking up the stock market before the midterm elections,\" said Howard Ward, chief investment officer of Gamco Investors.\n\n\"There have been no discussions taking place between China and the U.S.,\" Ward said. \"There will be no deal next month.\"\n\nFor months, administration officials have said that talks with China were stalling. The president has maintained the country is not ready to come to the table. Just over two weeks ago, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told CNBC that talks were on \"hiatus.\"\n\nRoss also cast doubt on the idea that a deal could be advanced during talks at the G-20 summit this month.\n\n\"You can't do a multi-thousand-page trade agreement in an hour,\" he said at the time.\n\nThis week is not the first time that the market has risen on reports that the U.S. and China were nearing a deal. A similar situation played out over the summer. Ultimately, those talks came to nothing \u2014 with an official telling CNBC that there had been \"zero\" engagement between the two countries.\n\nThe off-and-on nature of the negotiating process has left a sour taste in the mouth of some investors.\n\n\"I challenge the White House to bring us a deal which we will then celebrate,\" Ward said. \"It's not going to happen.\"\n\nThe trade gambit comes as Trump has floated a number of other last-minute policy proposals that experts say are unlikely to come to pass, at least on the timeline the president has offered.\n\nTrump said last month that his administration was working on a \"resolution\" that would cut taxes on the middle class by the midterm elections, despite lawmakers having left Washington. That resolution has yet to materialize.\n\nHe has also pledged to sign an executive order doing away with birthright citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants, which experts say would amount to a broad reinterpreting of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution \u2014 something that is outside of the president's executive authority. Trump has said the issue will be resolved by the Supreme Court.\n\nWATCH:This trade deal may be what Trump needs to take on China", "Elon Musk plans a truck he says looks like something out of 'Blade Runner' 3:05 PM ET Fri, 2 Nov 2018 | 01:11\n\nElon Musk is serious about plans for a Tesla pickup truck, and says it's going to look like something out of the sci-fi movie \"Blade Runner.\"\n\nMusk announced plans for a Tesla pickup truck as far back as April 2017, saying in a Twitter post that the vehicle would be unveiled \"in 18 to 24 months\" \u2014 he later followed up to say the truck would be made \"right after\" the firm builds its Model Y SUV.\n\nThe electric vehicle manufacturer unveiled early sketches of what the pickup truck would look like last November, at an event held by the firm where it unveiled its semitruck and Roadster sports car.\n\nNow, Musk has come out with some more details about the vehicle, telling Recode's Kara Swisher during a podcast that it will be \"like a really futurist-like cyberpunk, 'Blade Runner' pickup truck.\"", "The \"Fast Money\" traders shared their first moves for the market open.\n\nTim Seymour was a buyer of Chevron\n\nKaren Finerman was a buyer of CBS\n\nBrian Kelly was a buyer of the 20+ Yr Treasury Bond ETF\n\nDan Nathan was a buyer of the Energy ETF\n\nTrader disclosure: On November 1, 2018 the following stocks and commodities mentioned or intended to be mentioned on CNBC's \"Fast Money\" were owned by the \"Fast Money\" traders: Tim Seymour is long ACBFF, AMZA, ACB, APC, APH, BABA, BAC, BIDU, BX, C, CCJ, CGC, CLF, CMG, CNTTF, CRON, CSCO, CWEB, CX, DAL, DPZ, DVYE, EA, EEM, ERJ, EUFN, EWM, FB, FXI, GE, GILD, GM, GOOGL, GTII, GWPH, HAL, HK.APH, HYYDF, INTC, ITHUF, JD, KHRNF, KSHB, LEAF, MAT, MCD, MJNE, MO, MOS, MPEL, MPX, MRMD, NKE, OGI, ORGMF, OTC, PAK, PHM, PYPL, RH, RL, SBUX, SQ, STZ, T, TIF, TGOD, TRSSF, TRST, TWTR, UA, UAL, VALE, VIAB, VOD, X, XLE, XRT, YNDX, 700.

Between 1960 and 2016, the median income for a renter grew by just 5 percent. During the same period, the median rent ballooned by more than 60 percent, according to The Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University. (Both figures account for inflation.)\n\nTo be sure, buying a house has also become harder for many Americans \u2014 to do so now costs four times the median household income. The homeownership rate fell to 63 percent in 2016 \u2013 the lowest rate in half a century.\n\n\"Still, renters seem to be worse off,\" said Corianne Scally, a senior research associate at the Urban Institute and a co-author of the study.\n\nThe Urban Institute's findings come out of its 2017 well-being and basic needs survey, which received responses from 7,500 people ages 18 to 64.", "Fuller received both his bachelors and masters degrees in mechanical engineering from MIT and later his Ph.D. in bioengineering from Caltech. He now directs the Autonomous Insect Robotics Laboratory at UW, which works to advance insect-scale robotics engineering and better understand the capabilities of insects. \"Robotics on the insect scale have a lot of constraints. That's what interests me,\" he said.\n\nBy constraints he means \"fly-sizing\" things like scanning lasers, cameras and range finders. \"A lot of the sensors that have been used on larger robots successfully just aren't available at fly size. Radar, scanning lasers, range finders \u2014 these things that make the perfect maps of the world, that things like self-driving cars use. So we're going to have to use basically the same sensor suite as a fly uses, a little camera,\" Fuller said.\n\nFuller became inspired by insect robotics 20 years ago when he started observing a group at UC Berkeley who were trying to create a \"micromechanical flying insect\" that weighed less than a paper clip and could lift off the ground and hover.\n\n\"They started having success, but these little flying robots needed a wire going up to them.\" Later he got involved with a series of other advances. \"We got them to fly under control rather than just take off; we put sensors on board and made them land and do other things.\"\n\nNow 41, Fuller and his team is one step closer to creating a fully autonomous robo-insect: For now, RoboFly can only take off and land. Once its photovoltaic cell is out of the direct line of sight of the laser, the robot runs out of power and lands. But the team hopes to soon be able to steer the laser so that RoboFly can hover and fly around. They are currently working on more advanced brains and sensor systems to help the robots navigate and complete tasks on their own, Fuller said.\n\n\"For full autonomous I would say we are about five years off probably,\" he said.\n\nAccording to Goldman Sachs, the three largest industries for drones are construction, agriculture and insurance, with the total current market value for each at $11 million, $5 million and $1.4 million, respectively. Fuller sees many opportunities for robo-insects that the larger drones can't handle. The application he sees as most promising for flying robotic insects is micro-agriculture. \"Robotic flies will have a part to play in terms of their ability to fly around and really monitor the environment \u2014 things like humidity, state of disease \u2014 in a very detailed level, flying down, in and above the plants to look for disease or pests and to monitor air quality.\"\n\nMore from The Edge:\n\nHyperloop One takes first step on a promising test road in America's Heartland\n\nTrump's battle against Silicon Valley may create an opening for China in artificial intelligence", "The U.S. government has agreed to let eight countries, including close allies South Korea and Japan, as well as India, keep buying Iranian oil after it reimposes sanctions on Tehran next week, Bloomberg cited a U.S. official as saying.\n\nIran's biggest oil customers \u2014 all in Asia \u2014 have been seeking sanctions waivers to allow them to continue buying some of its oil and have argued that a total ban would spur a further rally in the price of crude.\n\nBloomberg reported on Friday that South Korea and Japan had received waivers along with India, which relies heavily on Iranian supplies.\n\nA list of all countries getting waivers was expected to be released officially on Monday, Bloomberg said.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from the White House.\n\nThe United States is preparing to impose new sanctions on Iran's oil industry after Washington withdrew from a nuclear deal between Tehran and other global powers earlier this year.\n\nBut the move has backfired on U.S. President Donald Trump as it led to a steep rally in oil prices, including the cost of gasoline, ahead of U.S. mid-term elections.\n\nIt was unclear how much crude those eight countries would be allowed to buy from Iran, whose oil exports have plummeted from an average of more than 2.5 million barrels per day to around 1.5 million bpd in recent weeks.\n\nGoldman Sachs said it expects Iran's crude exports to fall to 1.15 million bpd by the end of the year. During a previous round of sanctions at the start of the decade, Iranian oil exports declined at times to below 1 million bpd.\n\nIran said on Friday the report on waivers showed that the market needed the country's crude.\n\n\"The waivers granted to these eight countries show that the market needs Iran's oil and it cannot be pulled out of the market ... I don't know whether these waivers are permanent or temporary,\" state TV quoted Iran's Deputy Oil Minister Ali Kardor as saying.\n\nOil prices rallied this year to a four-year high above $85 per barrel on fears Washington may want to cut Iranian oil exports to zero.\n\nBut the rally petered out in recent weeks amid market fears about a slowing global economy and as expectations grew that Iran would be allowed still to export significant amounts.\n\nOn Friday, Brent futures traded flat at around $73, having fallen 12 percent since the beginning of October.\n\nWaiting for Notifications\n\nA Chinese official told Reuters that discussions with the U.S. government about waivers were ongoing and that a result was expected over the next couple of days.\n\n\"We think Trump will agree to China importing some volumes, similar to the treatment that India and South Korea receive,\" Clayton Allen of Height Securities said in a note on Friday.\n\nSouth Korea's Foreign Ministry declined to comment, and Japanese officials were not immediately available for comment.\n\nAnother country that has been seeking a sanctions waiver is Turkey. Turkey's Energy Ministry said on Friday it had not received written notification of any exemption.\n\nAnalysts said, however, that waivers would likely be only temporary.\n\n\"The U.S. may use waivers to slow-walk implementation, but these will not apply indefinitely,\" Allen said.\n\nAmong other countries closely connected to Iran's energy system is Iraq, which imports gas via a pipeline. The United Arab Emirates imports large amounts of Iranian fuel oil to power ships and Egypt imports oil from Iran for the Sumed pipeline.\n\nRussia has been planning to import oil from Tehran but no major projects have materialized.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "The head of the U.S. central bank has some concerns about reducing immigration to the U.S.\n\nDoing so could stunt growth the labor force and therefore hurt the U.S. economy long term, Fed Chairman Jay Powell said in a letter to a Democratic senator, seen by Bloomberg News.\n\nSen. Catherine Cortez, D-Nev., asked if Powell agreed with his colleague, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, on the topic. Kashkari wrote in a January Wall Street Journal column that immigration is \"as close to a free lunch as there is\" for the U.S. economy. Kashkari's parents came from India and his wife is from the Philippines.\n\n\"From an economic growth standpoint, reduced immigration would result in lower population growth and thus, all else equal, slower trend economic growth,\" Powell wrote in the letter, according to Bloomberg.\n\nThe comments are a stark contrast from President Donald Trump's take on immigration, a divisive issue ahead of midterm elections next week. Since campaigning in 2016 to build a wall with Mexico, the president has categorized immigration as a threat and a burden to taxpayers.\n\nHis latest hard-line proposal was a plan this week to do away with birthright citizenship for children born to noncitizens and undocumented immigrants. The White House deployed U.S. troops to the border to support Customs and Border Protection agents preparing for the arrival of a caravan of an estimated 4,000 migrants. Trump said the total U.S. troops could reach 15,000 \u2014 roughly double the number the Pentagon said it currently plans for a mission.\n\n\u2014 Read the full Bloomberg report here.\n\nWATCH:Trump vs. Obama: Here's who inherited the better economy", "Apple stock is plunging \u2014 Here's what six experts say investors should know 12:05 PM ET Fri, 2 Nov 2018 | 04:35\n\nApple stock plunged 6.6 percent Friday, a day after the company delivered a strong earnings report but surprised investors with a major shake-up of its quarterly reporting structure and light guidance for the holiday quarter.\n\nShares ended trading at $207.48, just above the threshold for Apple to maintain its historic $1 trillion market cap, based on Apple's most recently reported share count.

Even after the recent stock market slump, shares of his cloud software company have tripled in value this year, bolstering Lawson's net worth by hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nBut while it's been a good year for Twilio, whose technology powers text and video-based communications systems, Lawson is distressed by what he sees among his Silicon Valley peers.\n\nHe can't understand why it's so hard for companies to stand up to hate speech and cut off abusers.\n\n\"It's an easy decision to make,\" Lawson said in a phone interview this week while in Europe meeting with customers. \"There's a responsibility that we all have to help ensure we're not just building a good company but a better society around us.\"\n\nLawson wrote a blog post on Monday titled, \"Words matter, and they're destabilizing the American tribe.\" The post came after a mass shooting in Pittsburgh, where a gunman stormed the Tree of Life synagogue and killed 11 Jewish worshippers, and after another person mailed explosive devices to prominent Democrats (none exploded).\n\nIn both cases, the people accused of these crimes shared their violent hate speech on social media networks.\n\nLawson criticized the current \"power-holders\" in America for allowing white nationalism and other once-extreme views to be discussed and debated openly. But he also slammed \"social media companies who go out of their way to ensure that extreme right wing views are treated fairly.\"\n\nLawson told CNBC he understands there could be murky situations requiring tough judgment calls.\n\nBut he said that far too many business executives use that struggle as an excuse to do nothing.\n\n\"That's a facade that some leaders hide behind to say we're not going to try,\" Lawson said. \"Yes, sometimes it is hard. There is a gray area.\"\n\nHe noted that business leaders have to deal with complicated decisions all the time.\n\n\"All day, every day we make decisions with imperfect information, whether it's hiring people, making investments or entering new regions.\"", "\"Raising the minimum wage isn't enough. If we want to restore an economy that works for everyone, not just the wealthiest few, more needs to be done. One way to put the middle class back at the center of the economy is through overtime pay.\"\n\nTypically, an employee who works more than 40 hours a week is entitled to time-and-a-half pay for any extra hours. The problem is that most managers aren't eligible for overtime pay. So, a lower-wage employee could be given some managerial responsibilities \u2013 for instance, opening the store in the morning \u2013 and be forced to work 60 or 70 hours a week without overtime pay. Even if she spent the rest of her day performing physical duties like stocking shelves or working a cash register, her quasi-managerial status would render her ineligible for overtime pay.\n\nRight now, workers who earn over $23,660 a year could find themselves laboring more than 40 hours a week without earning overtime compensation. That's why the Obama Administration moved in 2016 to double the salary threshold from $23,660 to $47,476 under which all employees must receive overtime pay. Raising this threshold made 4 million more workers eligible for overtime pay. It's no wonder this policy been called \"a minimum wage hike for the middle class.\"\n\nWith the typical salaried employee working 49 hours a week, this policy change would've provided a substantial uptick in paychecks. To be sure, some employers might've chosen to hire additional workers instead of paying overtime to existing staff. That's a good thing, because it creates job opportunities for more people. And for the employee who goes from working 60 hours a week to only 40 hours, she now has more time to attend her child's soccer game, pursue a favorite hobby, or give back to the community.\n\nThis was a sensible and long overdue policy change. But shortly after coming into office, Donald Trump pulled back the Obama overtime rule despite promising in his inauguration address to address the plight of \"struggling families across the land.\" The effect of this reversal has been longer hours for workers and an estimated $1.2 billion in lost wages.\n\nCurrently, only 7 percent of full-time workers in the U.S. are covered by overtime protections, a significant drop from the 62 percent that were covered in the 1970s. While the Trump Administration dawdles on proposing a new federal overtime standard, states and companies have stepped in to fill the void.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, Gov. Tom Wolf is using his rulemaking authority to adopt the Obama overtime salary threshold and increase wages for nearly a half million workers in his state. This follows a similar regulatory process that is occurring in Washington state, as well as overtime pay increases already enacted in California and New York.\n\nOvertime has become a big issue in the Ohio governor's race, with Democrat Rich Cordray attacking his Republican opponent, Attorney General Mike DeWine, for filing suit against the Obama overtime regulation, which would've benefitted over 327,000 Ohioans. And, despite the rollback of the Obama regulation, companies like Walmart and White Castle have gone ahead and implemented the higher overtime threshold.\n\nThere's never been a better time to provide a pay raise to America's middle class. After all, what good is a booming economy if employees are stuck at work late into the evenings or on weekends? And what kind of society requires the majority of people to put in more than 40 hours a week for no additional pay?\n\nFor nearly 100 years, there has been bipartisan agreement on the importance of overtime pay. With the failure of the Trump Administration to take action, it's encouraging that others are moving to revitalize the American middle class.\n\nChris Lu served as Deputy Secretary of Labor during the Obama Administration and is now a senior fellow at the University of Virginia Miller Center.

It ordered 17 containers holding Crux 2.6-quart air fryers. \"These types of items and vendors get good airplay at Macy's,\" said Ferreira. \"Last year was a waffle maker.\"\n\nLooking through the data, Ferreira said, one of the biggest surprises this year was the 30 containers holding sofas for Macy's. \"The fact that there are not a lot of sofas in each container tends to lean toward a higher-end product of quality,\" he said. \"I don't recall from past years' data seeing them.\"\n\nWATCH:Sears was the Amazon of the 1930s.

Cook also said foreign exchange rates would have a $2 billion negative impact on Apple's sales forecast.\n\nApple was unsure whether it can make enough new iPhones, Apple Watches, iPads and Mac models it released in recent weeks, Cook told Reuters. Apple is widely expanding the use of its facial recognition unlocking system in iPhones and iPads, which uses special lasers that are still produced by only a handful of suppliers.\n\nCook said that Apple is \"seeing some macroeconomic weakness in some of the emerging markets,\" without specifying which ones.\n\nBut Cook stressed that Apple was happy with its performance in China, where revenue grew 16 percent to $11.4 billion, the fifth quarter in a row the company has had double-digit growth in the region.\n\nApple's cautious forecast could accelerate investor fears that have in turn erased stock market gains for much of the year. At market close on Thursday, Apple shares were up more than 25 percent for the year - supported by purchases by Warren Buffett and a $100 billion share buy-back program - while the Nasdaq Composite Index is nearly flat for the year.\n\n\"I think they've always been fairly conservative with the guidance they've given out,\" said Trip Miller, managing partner at Apple shareholder Gullane Capital Partners. \"I hope that's the case here.\"\n\nApple sold 46.9 million iPhones in the fiscal fourth quarter, missing analyst expectations of 47.5 million iPhones, according to FactSet. But the average selling price of iPhones was $793, well above analyst estimates of $750.78, according to FactSet.\n\nApple said revenue from services, which includes iCloud, the App Store and Apple Music, reached $10 billion, in line with analyst estimates. Apple investors have been increasingly focused on growth in the company's services business as growth in the global market for smartphones levels off in terms of unit sales.\n\nApple forecast a tax rate of 16.5 percent for the December quarter, above analyst expectations of 15.9 percent, according to data from Refinitiv.\n\n\"There's going to be a minimum tax on foreign earnings coming from the new tax legislation\" passed in the United States, Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told Reuters.\n\nFor its full fiscal 2018 ended in September, Apple reported revenue of $265.6 billion and profits of $11.91 per share, beating analyst estimates of $264 billion and $11.79 per share.\n\n(Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Editing by Peter Henderson and Lisa Shumaker)", "Apple stock is plunging \u2014 Here's what six experts say investors should know 12:05 PM ET Fri, 2 Nov 2018 | 04:35\n\nJust as tech stocks began to turn around from their worst month since the 2008 recession, Apple dragged down the Nasdaq after hour, as it reported light guidance for its next quarter and notified investors it would stop offering unit sales figures for iPhones and other products.\n\nThe Nasdaq closed up 1.75 percent Thursday, starting November on an upswing. But as Apple slid 7 percent after hours, briefly dipping below its $1 trillion market cap, the Nasdaq lost most of its gains from the day, slipping 1.72 percent in postmarket trading.\n\nSeveral other tech giants saw notable after-hours drops after Apple reported earnings, including Amazon (down 1.5 percent), Facebook (down 1 percent) and Netflix (down about 2 percent).\n\nAlthough it beat analyst expectations on revenue and earnings per share, Apple missed estimates for iPhone sales, reporting 46.89 million compared to analyst predictions of 47.5 million according to FactSet and StreetAccount.\n\nApple projected $89 billion to $93 billion revenue for its first quarter, just shy of analyst estimates of $93.02 billion.\n\n-CNBC's Sara Salinas contributed to this report.", "Data on U.S. manufacturing growth and President Donald Trump's tweet about speaking with the Chinese president paved the way for stocks to continue climbingin Thursday's trading session, CNBC's Jim Cramer said.\n\nBetween a report that showed \"a real slowdown\" in manufacturing growth in October \u2014 a sign that could lead the Federal Reserve to pause its interest rate hikes \u2014 and \"a thaw\" in U.S.-China relations, much of the stock market managed to mount a recovery from its October lows, Cramer said.\n\n\"I've been saying that we need to see the Fed or the president blink in their respective battles against inflation and China. Neither one blinked today, but ... we got a glimpse of how things could go right and it sent stocks flying,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said.\n\nCramer found the manufacturing report from The Institute for Supply Management especially interesting. The Manufacturing Index, which tracks national factory activity, was at its lowest level since April. New orders, production and the employment index all fell since last month.\n\n\"Now, I'm not saying they need to stop tightening immediately,\" he said. \"I am absolutely fine with another rate hike next month because I want to ensure that the economy won't overheat, just like the Fed.

Analysts expected Apple's ASP to come in at $750.78, which means this is a huge beat for Apple.\n\nThe increase is largely due in part to Apple's introduction of more expensive iPhones. It launched the $999 iPhone X last year and, in Sept., introduced the new iPhone XS which starts at $999 and the iPhone XS Max, which costs $100 more. Keep in mind that sales of the more affordable iPhone XR, which launched in Oct., were not included in the report and so don't factor into the ASP.\n\nIn short, even though Apple's iPhone unit sales growth is slowing, it almost doesn't matter.

Young merged his fledgling company with Ewing's own open-source Linux software distributor and moved to Durham, North Carolina (Red Hat is currently headquartered in Raleigh).\n\nYoung served as CEO, using his sales background to focus on the company's operations, while Ewing handled the software engineering.\n\nBecause of his lack of money, Young had to get creative when it came to funding this bootstrapped venture. So, he took steps that, in hindsight, might seem ill-advised: he and Ewing racked up credit card debt.\n\n\"The banks used to spam the world with credit card applications, and I would fill them out and send them in and they would send me another $5,000 credit card,\" Young tells CNBC Make It. \"And, I would use the $5,000 to pay off the previous credit card I had signed up for. I got these credit cards up to $50,000, which in 1994 was a lot of money.\"\n\nYoung's credit card debt eventually reached about $50,000, spread across at least eight different cards. \"I thought of it as creative finance,\" Young says. His wife thought he should \"go to jail,\" he jokes. In fact, it was Young's wife, Nancy, who made the credit card ploy work, thanks to the fact that she had a better credit rating than Young.\n\nYoung now calls his wife \"probably the single-most important contributor\" to the initial success of Red Hat. \"Without my wife Nancy's sterling credit rating, I wouldn't been able to raise the money that got us to profitability,\" he says.\n\nYoung and Ewing were able to fund the company with their mounting credit card debt through the fall of 1995, when the company released a new version of its open-source software that first started turning a profit, which allowed them to finally pay off the cards.\n\nBy 1998, Red Hat was generating sales of more than $5 million per year, and that number doubled to more than $10 million by the following year. Young remained CEO through Red Hat's 1999 IPO, which gave the company a multi-billion dollar valuation.\n\nYoung stepped down as CEO after the IPO, handing the reins to Matthew Szulik, who had helped take the company public as Red Hat's president. (Szulik led Red Hat until 2007, when former Delta Airlines COO Jim Whitehurst took over.)\n\nDespite his success, Young has no problem expressing humility and a sense of humor about his career (his LinkedIn profile lists his title at Lulu.com as \"Coffee Mug Washer\"), and he is quick to give the credit for Red Hat's massive exit to his partners and successors, including Ewing, Szulik and current CEO Whitehurst.\n\n\"The $34 billion success has nothing to do with me. I will take some credit for spotting the initial opportunity. The actual execution of that opportunity, the credit goes to much smarter guys than me.\"\n\nYoung also left Red Hat's board of directors for good in 2005, explaining at the time that he was better suited to the life of a serial entrepreneur than a corporate director with a less hands-on role.\n\nFor that reason, Young founded Lulu.com in 2002 and he continues to serve as the company's CEO. The following year, he bought his hometown Canadian Football League team, the Hamilton Tiger-Cats. And, he's also spent his time investing in projects like drone technology company PrecisionHawk (where he served as CEO from 2015 to 2017) and his wife's craft supplies company, Needlepoint.com.\n\nYoung sold all of his shares in Red Hat after leaving the company, he says, so he cashed out at a time when the company was worth a fraction of what IBM is paying. Young, who still walked away from Red Hat with a net worth of several hundred million dollars, tells CNBC Make It that he does not regret selling his Red Hat shares years before the company's big sale to IBM. He used that money to do \"a huge number of fun things,\" he says, from founding Lulu.com to supporting his local CFL team.\n\n\"Had I hung on to my Red Hat stake, I might have done better than I did by selling when I did,\" he says. \"But I do not regret for five minutes my decision, because my last 15 year have [gone] very differently than if I had just been a manager of a big Red Hat investment.\"\n\nDon't Miss:\n\n3 things Oculus co-founder Palmer Luckey splurged on when Facebook bought it for $2 billion\n\nHow these billion-dollar businesses started as happy accidents and side gigs", "In the quarter, Starbucks continued to focus on its cold beverage platform, which includes cold brew, nitro cold brew, refreshers and cold foam, as customers have been craving more iced drinks than hot ones.\n\nIt also moved a number of \"remedial tasks\" that baristas were doing during the day to be done during closing so that they would have more time to work with customers, Brewer told CNBC.\n\nBeverage sales \"contributed 3 of the 4 points of comp growth, the strong efforts performance of fiscal year 2018 and given it's our highest margin category, we're encouraged by this shift in [comparable store sales] growth,\" Roz Brewer, chief operating officer at Starbucks, said during an earnings conference call Thursday.\n\n\"You'll continue to hear us talk about beverage innovation because that's where we see our greatest push from transaction growth,\" she said.\n\nThe company's net income fell 4.1 percent to $755.8 million, or 56 cents a share, during the 13-week fiscal fourth quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with $788.5 million, or 54 cents a share, during the same period last year.\n\nAfter adjusting for some one-time items, the company earned 62 cents a share while analysts expected 60 cents a share, according to average estimates compiled by Refinitiv.\n\nStarbucks said its loyalty program, which accounts for 14 percent of all its transactions, now has 15.3 million members, a 15 percent jump from last year.

But he said the retailer is expecting to benefit from a slew of rival retailers such as Bon-Ton filing for bankruptcy and shutting stores.\n\nAs part of its strategy, Kohl's said it will be giving back more of its \"Kohl's Cash\" than ever before, including a pre-Black Friday event Thursday where shoppers can get $15 to use for every $50 spent. The same deal will run again from Nov. 19 to Nov. 23, according to Kohl's, and again on Cyber Monday.

For comparison, one pint of vanilla Halo Top has 280 calories, 8 grams of fat, 24 grams of sugar, 20 grams of sugar alcohol and 20 grams of protein. One pint of vanilla Haagen-Dazs has 1,000 calories, 68 grams of fat, 80 grams of sugar and 16 grams of protein.\n\nTherein lies the sell. \"Halo Top is the first-ever ice cream, first and foremost, that's actually good for you and actually tastes good, so it's kind of an oxymoron,\" says Bouton.\n\nWhether Halo Top is \"healthier\" than regular ice cream depends on how much you're eating, according to Lisa Moskovitz, a registered dietitian and the CEO of The NY Nutrition Group, a Manhattan-based nutrition counseling practice.\n\n\"If you can stick with the appropriate \u00bc pint (or \u00bd serving) then it can make for a much healthier alternative than regular ice cream,\" she says.\n\nBut the lower calorie count and sugar content (and arguably less satisfying taste) can cause people to eat more Halo Top than they would regular ice cream, she says. In that case, having one serving of regular ice cream might be a better choice.\n\nLauren Ott, a registered dietitian who calls herself \"The Dessert Dietitian\" for her love of sweets, agrees. She doesn't like that Halo Top's marketing encourages consumers to eat the whole pint. (The pint's foil topper says \"stop when you hit the bottom.\")\n\n\"Encouraging anyone to eat an entire pint of ice cream, low calorie or not, is encouraging binge eating,\" says Ott. (Bouton says Halo Top certainly doesn't want to encourage bad eating habits but that many people eat a certain number of calories a day and structure their meals to allow for half or a full pint of Halo Top, which he says is not binge eating.)\n\nPlus, in large amounts the sugar alcohols in Halo Top can \"wreak havoc on the digestive tract,\" Moskovitz says, but they are \"completely fine in moderation.\"\n\nSo what's the bottom line? \"As long as the consumer is eating Halo Top in appropriate servings, I think it's a great way to cut back on calories and sugar to curb your sweet craving,\" says Ott.\n\nAs for the taste, there are dissenting opinions. One Reddit thread from April starts with a bold claim: \"I'm sorry but I think I'd rather have half of a serving of regular ice cream as opposed to an entire pint of halo top. Weirdest taste and texture EVER.\" The redditor was not alone: \"I hate it too! So much. And i wanted to like it badly. I've tried at least 20 flavors, but still nope,\" another person writes.\n\nOthers love it.\n\nBut Bouton is realistic about the experience. \"When it comes to the taste, I would never sit here with a straight face and tell somebody it's going to taste as good as a full-calorie, full-sugar, full-fat version. No chance,\" he says.\n\n\"It's meant to be something you can eat every day if you love ice cream,\" says Bouton. \"But it's not meant to replace your full-calorie, your indulgent ice creams. I still eat full-calorie ice cream. Not every day but every couple weeks for sure.\"\n\nSo what's Bouton's favorite flavor? That changes every week he says, but when he spoke with CNBC Make It, it was peanut butter and jelly, a seasonal flavor. \"[I]n the best way possible it tastes like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich in ice cream form.\"\n\nWhatever its place in customers' diets, Halo Top has already become more than a couple of lawyers could have ever imagined.\n\nThe brand launched internationally, first in Australia in January 2016 and this year in the United Kingdom, Canada, the Netherlands and New Zealand.

(Skinny Cow makes diet frozen desserts.) \"We couldn't have dreamed of what it has become and how big it has become.\"\n\nAnd it could get bigger.\n\n\"At one point in time, Coca-Cola was a start-up company that sold a soda and now it's this iconic centuries-old brand,\" Bouton says. \"Why can't we be the next Coca-Cola?

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo set the tone in a June speech where he accused China of an \"unprecedented level of larceny\" of intellectual property.\n\nTensions over trade in particular have exacerbated relations between the two world powers. President Donald Trump has slapped tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese products in an effort to narrow the U.S. trade deficit with China.

China has retaliated with tariff hikes on $110 billion of American products.\n\nThe tensions have extended into security issues. China has strongly criticized U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, and the U.S. has renewed its criticism of Beijing's island-building in the disputed South China Sea.

Malaysian authorities have issued an arrest warrant for him and have also applied for an Interpol red notice seeking assistance from the United Arab Emirates, Indonesia, India, Myanmar, China and Hong Kong.\n\nLow, whose Malaysian passport has been revoked, has previously denied any wrongdoing.\n\nLawyers for Leissner and Low could not immediately be reached for comment.

Leissner, Ng and others received large bonuses in connection with that revenue.\n\nWhile U.S. prosecutors have previously filed civil asset forfeiture suits for assets allegedly bought with some of the stolen funds, these are the first criminal charges the Justice Department has brought against individuals in the case under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, a federal law targeting official bribery abroad.\n\nAt least six countries, including Malaysia, the United States and Switzerland, have been investigating alleged thefts from 1MDB.\n\nThe 1MDB investigations in the United States and Malaysia have gathered pace since Najib unexpectedly lost a general election in May to Mahathir Mohamad, who returned to power 15 years after he retired as prime minister.\n\nSince the election, Malaysian authorities have brought 38 charges against Najib.

Sherrod Brown of Ohio holds an unusual distinction in the 2018 midterm campaign for Congress. He is a Democrat seeking re-election in a state President Donald Trump carried easily two years ago. But unlike several colleagues in the same situation, the raspy-voiced populist has moved far ahead of Republican challenger Jim Renacci in polls assessing his bid for a third term. If Brown wins and Democrats manage to recapture the Senate, Brown stands to chair the Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee \u2014 a worrisome prospect for Wall Street. Brown's success has placed him squarely in early speculation about Democrats who may seek the presidency in 2020. More than most politicians in his party, he has shown broad appeal among working-class voters \u2013 including the blue-collar whites who represent Trump's political base. That's not merely a matter of personality. Brown sides with Trump's combative posture on trade, backing the president's decision to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, rewrite the North American Free Trade Agreement and confront China with tariffs. An avid baseball fan, Brown sat down with me last week at the stadium in Columbus that is home to the AAA farm team for the Cleveland Indians. In an interview that followed the mailing of pipe bombs to prominent Democrats but preceded the mass shooting in a Pittsburgh synagogue, we discussed the nation's political climate, the Democratic economic agenda, his sometime-partnership with the president, and the possibility that he might soon challenge Trump for the White House. A partial transcript from Speakeasy with John Harwood featuring Senator Sherrod Brown follows.\n\nAll references must be sourced to CNBC.com.\n\nSherrod Brown: Welcome to Columbus, and Huntington Stadium.\n\nJohn Harwood: You're a big baseball guy. Give me your number one moment as a player, and your number one moment as a fan.\n\nBrown: My number one moment as a player was pitching two no-hitters in a row in Little League.\n\nHarwood: You were the Johnny Vander Meer.\n\nBrown: Johnny Vander Meer; two in a row. That's right, yeah. This guy knows baseball. Well done. An Ohio team. As a fan it had to be the 2016 World Series with Connie and my children, my daughters. We'd started going to games when the Indians really weren't very good. And when Rajai Davis hit a two-run homer I was thrilled. Cleveland came back and tied it.\n\nHarwood: That was the rain delay game.\n\nBrown: Then the rain delay came and the world went to hell. The Indians lost in extra innings, and Hillary lost the election the same week. Oh, well.\n\nHarwood: Several of your colleagues in states that President Trump won comfortably are in trouble this election year. You're in one of those states, but you're not in trouble. Explain that.\n\nBrown: I don't look at voters as Trump voters or Clinton voters. I don't look at workers as white workers or black workers. I talk about workers. In the end, it's whose side are you on. I urge my colleagues always, if there are Democratic majorities, whenever there are, that we really do focus on the dignity of work. That is making sure that people who get up every day, work hard, play by the rules, have a decent standard of living. That their wages go up, that their health-care benefits are adequate, that they have some retirement, and that we have to make sure we keep health-care costs down. There's no interest in doing that in Washington. Now, their interest is more tax cuts for the rich, more cuts in Medicare. I mean, McConnell's comments in the last couple of weeks \u2014 where three-quarters of the dollars went to the richest 1 percent and the way we pay for that is to cut Medicare and Social Security or raise the eligibility age \u2014 that's morally reprehensible, and it's bad economics, and they all should be ashamed of themselves for that.\n\nHarwood: Now, one thing that distinguishes you from your Democratic colleagues is that you have affirmatively worked with Trump on a major policy issue. You support his tariffs. Every recent president in both parties, and every economist that I talk to, have said that tariff policies make no sense economically. That they cost more jobs than they save. Why are you with him?\n\nBrown: Well, respectfully, you need to talk to a wider swath of economists. I think you've got to spool back. And economists don't do this because economists often have a pretty cloistered existence in their lives. You've got to think how we got here. And if you drive through the industrial Midwest, and in the central valley of California, too, you will see example after example of how a company shut down production in Mansfield, my hometown, or Toledo or Dayton, moved overseas, built a plant there and collected a tax break to do it. Because our tax and trade policy has played into that for decades. And no president was willing to address it. Tariffs are a temporary enforcement tool. They're not a long-term trade policy. I would've done it differently from the president. I would not have called it a trade war. I would've explained to the American public what in fact he was doing for the end outcome \u2014 to deal with Chinese cheating, basically. I would've aimed our tariffs not at our allies \u2014 Canada and Western Europe \u2014 and would have worked with those allies to figure out how you stop Chinese, longtime serial cheating.\n\nHarwood: But isn't the lesson of the modern world continuously in one direction \u2014 that is, toward the freer movement of people and capital? And aren't you basically trying to make water flow uphill by interfering with the laws of economics on that?\n\nBrown: Well, the laws of economics haven't worked for much of this country in terms of working-class people, regardless of race. It's easy for a professor to preach that. It's maybe even a little fun for the media to echo that. But the fact is that \u2026\n\nHarwood: Bill Clinton and Barack Obama share your values.\n\nBrown: They were wrong. They share my values. I share their values. They were wrong on trade.\n\nHarwood: When you have presidents from both parties \u2014 one fundamentally close to business, the other close to labor \u2014 it tells me they see that for the nation as a whole, expanded trade is good.\n\nBrown: If presidents of each party are in the same place, does that justify the Vietnam War? I don't think because presidents in both parties were in the same place, that makes it good policy. You think trade has nothing to do with the fact that the 1 percent are getting richer and richer and richer? In this country, you're seeing profits go up. You're seeing executive compensation go up sharply. You're seeing productivity go up. And wages are flat. A big part of the reason wages are flat is because we have not done globalization well. We've not taken care of people who have lost their jobs. We have not fought for labor rights and environmental rights. I wear this pin. It's a depiction of a canary in a birdcage. It was given to me at a Workers Memorial Day. It symbolizes the mine worker in the canary. But it symbolizes the role of government to help middle-class people and create and build a middle class.\n\nHarwood: Let me ask you about the word \"socialism\" in our politics. The White House just put out a report the other day attacking socialism, and linking Democrats and Democratic proposals to socialism. Is it a dirty word?\n\nBrown: It's a political calculation that's poll-tested by Karl Rove and whoever is the new Karl Rove in the Republican Party. It's pretty meaningless in terms of the way we do our jobs. I want government on the side of the public. I want government to respect the dignity of work and advocate for workers. I don't really care about labels.\n\nHarwood: You're not scared of that word?\n\nBrown: No, I'm not. I don't think voters think about that stuff.\n\nHarwood: Is Medicare-for-all socialism?\n\nBrown: No. I think the better way to do health care is to allow \u2014 and I've worked on this for years \u2014 Medicare buy-in at 55. That was part of the Affordable Care Act until we fell short of the 60 votes. Look who is most vulnerable in health care. It's a 58- or a 61-year-old man or woman in Dayton who has lost her job because her plant closed. She's 58. She can't find insurance. And it's a point in her life when her health's getting bad, especially if she worked construction or in a factory or worked in a diner or worked in a hair salon and was on her feet all day. That's when they need Medicare.\n\nHarwood: Is that still what you're for? Not Medicare for all?\n\nBrown: I don't oppose Medicare for all. I've not co-sponsored Medicare for all because I don't think we get there now. I think what we do is Medicare at 55. It's voluntary. It's a buy-in. You can do it, fiscally responsibly, and give that 58-year-old, laid-off woman in Zanesville, Ohio, a chance to buy in to Medicare at a reasonable price at that age.\n\nHarwood: The reason I asked the question about socialism is there does seem to have been a shift in the Democratic debate. When Obama was president, one of his aides told me \"we weren't allowed to use the word 'redistribution'\" \u2014 even though things like Obamacare did redistribute money from people who paid taxes for it to people who got benefits. You, Sen. Harris and others have proposed major redistribution of money to people through the earned income tax credit or other vehicles. Is that something that you see as now politically salable?\n\nBrown: I always have. I mean, the real masters at redistribution are Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, who redistribute income up. That's what they do.\n\nHarwood: Understood. But it has proven easier to do that by cutting someone's taxes than by having government write a check to someone. That's just been the political reality.\n\nBrown: That's their political reality. I'm surprised you buy into it, John.\n\nHarwood: No, what I'm saying is that has proven more politically achievable.\n\nBrown: It's politically achievable because Washington is rigged. Washington can always pass a tax cut for rich people because, who are most members of Congress? Many, many, many of them are millionaires. Who are most of the lobbyists? As you may know, John, there aren't a lot of people walking around the halls of Congress that are advocating for workers at the local diner in Garfield Heights. They're advocating for the big power companies and the big drug companies and Wall Street.\n\nHarwood: Do you think the table is set, politically, for Democrats to embrace in a full-throated way that kind of redistribution?\n\nBrown: I hope so. You use the word redistribution. To me, it's fairness. People that work in a diner, people that cut hair, people that work construction, they work every bit as hard as you do and I do. And they get so little to show for it, and they have a government that's not on their side so often. I don't call that redistribution, I call it justice. I call it fairness. It's what our government should be.\n\nHarwood: Sen. Warren has a proposal to do that more indirectly by requiring, as a condition of corporate charter, worker representation on corporate boards, which would not require government outlays. What do you think of that idea?\n\nBrown: That's fine. I support anything that gets us there. I also have a bill called the Freeloader Fee Act that says when a company \u2014 not a diner with 30 or 40 employees, but a big company of over X-number of people \u2014 pays so little that their workers are eligible for Medicaid, food stamps, housing vouchers and earned income tax credit, that they should pay a freeloader fee. They should reimburse taxpayers for their low wages. Their executives are making $6 million, $8 million, $10 million a year, their workers are paid so little that government subsidizes their workers. Those companies should have to pay a penalty for that.\n\nHarwood: Your election is in a little over a week. Immediately, there's going to be a lot of talk and action toward the 2020 race. Sen. Warren says she's going to take a hard look at it after the election. Seems clear she's going to run. What is your thinking on that issue?\n\nBrown: I'm thinking that Sen. Warren's probably going to run. Is that your question?\n\nHarwood: Are you thinking that Sen. Brown's going to run?\n\nBrown: I don't like the idea of running for president. I don't really have any real interest in that.\n\nHarwood: But I saw that you said to one of your home state newspapers you think about it from time to time, and you get people talking to you about it.\n\nBrown: No news on this story, sorry. I don't aspire to be president of the United States. I know my name's mentioned because I win in a Trump state. Here's what I hope comes out of this election. First of all, I hope to win. Second, I hope that Rich Cordray, who would be a really good governor, wins in the Democratic ticket. And third, I hope the message that I win with \u2013 the dignity of work and whose side are you on \u2013 gets into the national debate. Because plenty of my colleagues want to be president a lot more than I do.\n\nDIGITAL EXTRAS:\n\nBROWN ON THE POLITICAL CLIMATE IN THE U.S.\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/31/sherrod-brown-right-wing-media-and-trump-share-blame-for-divisions-in-us.html\n\nJohn Harwood: We've had this spate of now a dozen potentially explosive devices mailed to people in politics. What do you make of that? I was with your longtime colleague in Ohio politics, John Kasich, yesterday. And he was putting some of the blame on President Trump for things he's said. Do you see it that way or how do you feel?\n\nSherrod Brown: I don't want to point fingers. I have a debate tonight with my opponent. And I will ask him to join me in asking the president to try to unify the country. I remember when President Bush, with whom I vehemently disagreed on trade policy, on tax cuts for the rich, on the Iraq War \u2013 I remember President Bush right after Sept. 11 went to a mosque because he wanted to unify the country. And I wish this president would stop the divisive rhetoric. And I wish this president would respect your profession. And I'm not saying that because I'm sitting with someone from your profession.\n\nHarwood: You might be married to someone from that profession.\n\nBrown: I am also married to a journalist. But long before that, I never believed that the media were the enemy of the people, or that they don't play an important role. In fact, if anything, the media's role in keeping politicians and business honest has fallen back because there aren't enough reporters at the statehouse in Columbus or at the Capitol in Washington. There are not enough investigative reporters nosing around on Wall Street or at capitals. That, to me, is the biggest shortcoming of the media. Not that in any way, they're enemies of the people, but there are not enough of them. The big media companies are making money, but they're not hiring reporters and they're not paying them well. And they're not hiring investigators to do what needs to be done to keep our democracy strong and vibrant.\n\nHarwood: You hear a lot of pessimism these days about the state of our democracy and the political debate. Are you pessimistic, or not?\n\nBrown: I'm really never pessimistic. I think this is a troubled time. I think this president has added to the divisions \u2013 I mean, we were a divided country before Donald Trump, but he's made it much, much worse. We have one network that doesn't really believe in truth-telling, frankly. And the narrative that the number of people that still believe Barack Obama wasn't born in this country, or the number of people that think John McCain wasn't a hero as we've heard from some voter who have said because he left Vietnam and used his father's connections, when it was exactly the opposite \u2013 that comes from a news organization that has put out those untruths. My biggest concern for the country is how we govern. My biggest long-term concern is, first, climate change and this government now, the leadership in Washington \u2013 the Republican leadership has simply failed to acknowledge it. That worries me. I'm worried about the long-term impact on the judiciary, of young, very far-right, very much out-of-the-mainstream judges from district court all the way up to the Supreme Court. And I'm worried about the fact that it's hard to govern when a quarter of the country gets its news from a source that's not really news. And so, we've got to figure that out as a nation.\n\nBROWN ON DRUG PRICING\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/31/sen-sherrod-brown-trump-isnt-doing-enough-to-cut-drug-prices.html\n\nJohn Harwood: Did you see what the administration announced yesterday about Medicare changing drug reimbursement rates? Is that a good thing? Will it make a big difference?\n\nSherrod Brown: Small step. No.\n\nHarwood: Not a big step?\n\nBrown: It's a small step. The president called it revolutionary with his hyperbole \u2013 no surprise. It is not that. It's a good step. We need to do a lot, lot more. But fundamentally, the White House looks like a retreat for drug company executives. They made this step. Drug companies don't really like it. But if that's all they have to accept, they will be pretty happy. There are things we should do. Drug companies shouldn't be allowed to deduct the cost of advertising. Drug companies \u2014 we should negotiate the way we do with the VA. It works for veterans. We should serve those who serve us better, and we're doing it at least on drug pricing. We're not doing it on Agent Orange and some other things. But we're doing it on drug prices where the VA negotiates directly with the drug companies to bring prices down. We should do that with Medicare. We should do that with prescription drugs, generally.\n\nBROWN ON REGULATING WALL STREET\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/31/democrats-play-defense-against-wall-street-deregulation-sherrod-brown.html\n\nJohn Harwood: If you guys win the Senate, you'll be the chairman of the Banking Committee. Even if you don't win the Senate, a potential Democratic takeover of the House would give you more leverage as the ranking member of the Banking Committee. You gave a speech earlier this year where you said that you thought there was something fundamentally rotten in American finance. What is it that's rotten?\n\nSherrod Brown: Well, what's rotten on Wall Street is the influence the financial services industry continues to exert on Congress. Whenever they want something, they almost always get it. There's this collective amnesia that's set in on Congress, especially on Republicans, but a few Democrats, from time to time, where they forgot what happened 10 years ago. They forgot that it was Wall Street greed and overreach that cost hundreds of billions of dollars in retirement savings, cost millions of jobs, caused millions of foreclosures. And now, Wall Street comes knocking again. They want to deregulate this administration's appointees to a number of federal regulatory agencies, want to deregulate foreign banks in the United States. They want to weaken capital requirements on Wall Street. They want to weaken the consumer protection bureau.\n\nHarwood: So would your objective be principally to prevent Dodd-Frank from being weakened, or are there affirmative steps beyond Dodd-Frank that you think we should take to address what you think is right?\n\nBrown: Well, of course, it's both. You don't allow weakening of the rules that have made Wall Street behave a little better. But there are always new challenges, and especially on capital requirements. And I would add, especially in the consumer protection agency. Rich Cordray, a close friend of mine who happens to be running for governor of this state to succeed Governor Kasich \u2013 and Rich is a strong supporter of Medicaid expansion, his opponent not so much \u2013 Rich made his name, in a sense, I mean already had, as the head of the consumer bureau. And he stood up to Wall Street. We have a head of the consumer bureau now that's been basically a lapdog for Wall Street. And that's a big difference with what's happened in Washington \u2013 Rich Cordray versus a lapdog.\n\nHarwood: But it sounds like it's more of a defensive agenda that is, to prevent things that have been done from being dismantled, as opposed to trying to break up banks or reimposing Glass-Steagall.\n\nBrown: Yeah, I have little interest in reimposing Glass-Steagall. I don't think that's a \u2013 that's an answer to a question that's not being asked. Breaking up the banks \u2013 they're too big and too powerful \u2013 that's not on my agenda. My agenda is to, as you say, play defense, to make sure we have a vibrant consumer protection agency. It's to do oversight. I mean, the appointees from the administration to be these regulators are people, some of whom had a lot to do with the housing crisis, and a lot to do with the Wall Street greed and overreach. So you're damn right I play defense when they're trying to do things to undermine the economy. The animal spirits of Wall Street and the economy will always mean bankers want to take more risk. I don't blame them. They're acting in maybe their stockholders' best interest \u2013 not their communities', but their stockholders' best interest. You need regulators to say no. You need regulators, 120 miles from here on Lake Erie, to need regulators to make sure people don't dump stuff in Lake Erie. You need regulators to make sure banks don't take too much risk. This park is named after a midsized bank, Huntington Bank. They are a good bank. They do things right the great majority of the time. They're a great small business lender. I'm way less concerned about their overreach than I am the banks that are literally 10 times their size \u2013 in some cases, 15 times their size.\n\nAbout CNBC:\n\nWith CNBC in the U.S., CNBC in Asia Pacific, CNBC in Europe, Middle East and Africa, and CNBC World, CNBC is the recognized world leader in business news and provides real-time financial market coverage and business information 410 million homes worldwide, including more than 90 million households in the United States and Canada.

(However, ARK still holds Apple shares in some of its other actively managed exchange traded funds.)\n\nThe ARK Innovation ETF lost nearly 10 percent in the October tumult compared to declines of around 9 percent and 7 percent, respectively, for the Nasdaq and S&P 500.\n\nBut so far this year, the ARKK was still up 15 percent, dramatically outperforming the Nasdaq and S&P 500, which are up 1.4 percent and nearly 6 percent, respectively, in 2018.\n\n\"We're very focused on 'disruptive innovation' in general,\" explained Wood. She said she still considers Apple an innovator, but sees a bumpy road for the company ahead of an antitrust case in the Supreme Court later this month.\n\nBack in 2011, Apple was accused of acting as a monopoly taking 30 percent commission on iPhone apps, a practice that was blamed for consumers paying higher prices than they should.\n\n\"This will be the first time in a while that Apple is in the regulatory or legal spotlight,\" Wood argued.\n\nWood thinks Apple will be strong in the long run, but said the major October hit to other tech stocks has brought \"some interesting valuation.\"", "California-based start-up Royole has beaten major players Huawei and Samsung in launching what it claims is the world's first foldable smartphone.\n\nUnveiled Wednesday at a conference in Beijing, the FlexPai mobile phone was made available to consumers in a flash sale on Thursday. Priced from 8,999 to 12,999 yuan ($1,295.49 to $1,871.33), the company said it would start delivering the phones in December.\n\nRoyole, a six-year-old components manufacturer, said FlexPai would \"subvert people's perception of traditional smart phones,\" functioning as a portable device and a high-definition large screen tablet, with the capability to support dual-screen use.\n\nDuring the press conference, Bill Liu, founder and CEO of Royole, also announced that the firm would invest 200 million yuan into global firms that would develop apps and software for the device.\n\n\"The Royole FlexPai foldable smartphone provides mobile phone users with a revolutionary experience compared to traditional phones,\" Liu said.\n\n\"It perfectly solves the contradiction between the high-definition large-screen experience and portability, which introduces a whole new dimension to the human-machine interface. The phone's inherent design will forever change the consumer electronics industry, as well as the way people interact with and perceive their world.\"", "Just how much money do you need to be among the global 1 percent?\n\nAccording to the 2018 Global Wealth Report from Credit Suisse Research Institute, you need a net worth of $871,320 U.S. Credit Suisse defines net worth, or \"wealth,\" as \"the value of financial assets plus real assets (principally housing) owned by households, minus their debts.\"\n\nMore than 19 million Americans are in the 1 percent worldwide, Credit Suisse reports, far more than from any other country, while \"China is now clearly established in second place in the world wealth hierarchy,\" with 4.2 million citizens among the world's top 1 percent.\n\nTo be among the top 10 percent worldwide, you don't even need six figures: A net worth of $93,170 will do it.\n\nAnd even if you have just $4,210 to your name, you're still richer than half of the world's residents.\n\nThese numbers reflect the extreme level of persistent wealth inequality. As Credit Suisse reports: \"While the bottom half of adults collectively owns less than 1 percent of total wealth, the richest decile (top 10 percent of adults) owns 85 percent of global wealth, and the top percentile alone accounts for almost half of all household wealth (47 percent).\"\n\nThe good news is, \"there are signs that wealth inequality is no longer rising,\" Credit Suisse says.\n\nThe share of financial assets among many of the richest people and richest countries \"peaked in 2015 and has been declining since then. In previous reports, we predicted that wealth inequality would follow suit \u2014 possibly with a slight lag \u2014 and there is evidence that this is now the case. The share of the top decile and the top 5 percent remains at the same level as in 2016, while the share of the top 1 percent has edged down from 47.5 percent to 47.2 percent according to our best estimate.\"\n\nIt's too early to conclude that wealth inequality is on a downward trend, Credit Suisse reports, but \"the prevailing evidence suggests it may well have leveled out, albeit at a very high level.\"\n\nDon't miss: Here's how much money the top 1 percent have in savings\n\nLike this story?

And, you're taught that the world is yours for the taking and you believe it.\n\n\"Then, about your late 20s, early 30s, s--- gets real.\"\n\nIt's around this time in your life that life tends to become more stressful, with your career and relationships likely taking on added elements of gravity and responsibility, says Galloway, whose own career has involved founding multiple companies of his own as well as serving on the boards of companies such as Eddie Bauer, Urban Outfitters and The New York Times Company.\n\nAs you age into your 30s, you may be reaching the point where the grand dreams of your youth may begin to be dimmed, somewhat, by the harsh realities of the world. \"You may come to the recognition that you're not going to be a US Senator or have a fragrance named after you,\" Galloway says. \"And the stress of life, and also living up to the expectations you've set for yourself, gets, quite frankly, stressful and sometimes disappointing.\"\n\nBut, don't worry. It gets better. \"Then something wonderful happens in your late 40s and early 50s,\" Galloway continues. \"And that is you take stock of your life. And, if you were born in America and are fortunate enough to have an education and a good job, you start to take stock of your blessings.\"\n\nThose blessings might include your family, including children \u2014 \"these smaller things that look, smell and feel like you that are joyous,\" Galloway says.\n\nAs you get older, you begin to fully realize and appreciate how fortunate you are, Galloway says. \"You also recognize that our time here is finite and begin just naturally starting to appreciate each day-by-day, and you get happier,\" he says.\n\nThe most important takeaway from Galloway's algebra of happiness, he says, is the fact that older generations are typically the happiest demographic, even in spite of the fact that their health might be declining. In other words, be patient in the search for happiness and remember to appreciate what you have \u2014 especially when you're stressed out.\n\n\"The message to young people is the following: if you find yourself in your 30s stressed out, maybe disappointed at times, that's natural,\" he says. \"Happiness is there and it's waiting for you.\"\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nSelf-made millionaire: 3 things you need to do to be successful, happy and wealthy by age 30\n\nThis former Google X exec reverse engineered happiness \u2014 here's what he found\n\nLike this story?

The company measures transactions from 80 of the top 100 U.S. retailers and trillions of customer visits to U.S. retail sites. Online sales this year will benefit from an extra day between Cyber Monday to Christmas, which is likely to provide a $284 million sales boost, the report said. Adobe also forecast the best days for shopping online based on prices across product categories during previous years. For example, Thanksgiving is likely to be a good day to buy sporting goods as prices could be 13 percent lower than their average in the first 10 months of the year. Black Friday will still be a good option for television purchases as prices could be about 22 percent lower.\n\nApparel discounts could make items cheaper by 22 percent than average on Nov. 25, and toys are likely to be 19 percent cheaper on Cyber Monday, the report said.\n\nThe November and December holiday shopping season are critical for retailers, when they book an outsized portion of their annual sales and profits.\n\nOverall U.S. holiday sales including stores and online in 2018 will increase by 4.3 percent to 4.8 percent from a year ago, when consumer spending surged to a 12-year high, according to The National Retail Federation.

The 33 percent uptick from the previous three months brings Grayscale's inflows for the year to $330 million, its strongest year-to-date total since the firm started five years ago.

Photovoltaic cells directly convert the light of the sun into electricity.\n\n\n\nConstruction is expected to take 10 months, with the systems set to produce solar electricity by 2019.\n\n\n\nThe work is part of a 6.5 million euro ($7.4 million) initiative funded by the European Union and implemented by the ICAO. The program is targeting 14 countries with the aim of cutting CO2 emissions in the aviation sector.\n\nIn a statement Tuesday, Jonny Andersen, managing director for the Kenya Airports Authority, said that \"the expected savings on electricity as well as reduction in carbon emissions\" would \"contribute towards the efficient operations of Moi International Airport.\"\n\n\n\nMoi International Airport is the latest airport to turn to solar power.

Dave Brat re-elected to a third term. \"The economy is going great, tax cuts are good for everyone, and we want more of that going forward,\" Mourning told CNBC.\n\nBut about 60 miles south, in Goochland County, Virginia, CNBC met another kind of Republican, named Dave. He said he voted for President Donald Trump in 2016 but will vote for Brat's Democratic opponent, retired CIA operative Abigail Spanberger, in Tuesday's election.\n\n\"I voted for Trump 'cause I didn't want another Clinton in the White House,\" said Dave, who declined to give his last name so as not to alienate his neighbors in this conservative farming community.\n\n\"But I don't think people in Washington, D.C., care about anyone outside Washington, D.C.,\" Dave said. \"Nobody gives a darn about anything else. So I'm voting for Abigail Spanberger, 'cause she seems like she's actually gonna do something.

And Republicans have held the seat for almost 50 years. The last Democratic congressman from the district retired in 1971. In the most recent election here in 2016, Brat trounced his Democratic opponent by 15 points, and Trump carried the district by 7 points.\n\nBut this year, a tide of political and demographic forces has put the solidly Republican 7th District in play for the first time in recent memory. And not just in play \u2014 it's a dead heat between Brat and Spanberger, according to the most recent polling averages. Democrats need to flip at least 23 seats to win a majority in the House.\n\nIf Brat, a former economics professor, hangs onto his seat, it will be in part because of people like Steve Mourning, solid conservatives who credit Brat and his fellow Republicans in Congress for the strong economy.\n\nBut if Spanberger defeats Brat in a huge upset, it will be in part because of people like Dave, registered Republicans who feel Brat has chosen Washington, D.C., over Goochland County, and who see in Spanberger a candidate who is singularly focused on their needs.\n\nIt wouldn't be the first time, however, that an outsider has upset politics in the 7th District.", "Balance for oil looks like it could flip back into surplus next year, says pro\n\n7:46 AM ET Thu, 1 Nov 2018\n\nMichael Cohen, Barclays head of energy commodities research, discusses oil price moves and what he sees for energy commodities.", "Stocks could start November in the green 6:34 AM ET Thu, 1 Nov 2018 | 00:58\n\nCheck out the companies making headlines before the bell:\n\nDowDupont \u2013 The chemical maker beat estimates by 3 cents a share, with adjusted quarterly profit of 74 cents per share.

Sherrod Brown of Ohio holds an unusual distinction in the 2018 midterm campaign for Congress. He is a Democrat seeking re-election in a state President Donald Trump carried easily two years ago. But unlike several colleagues in the same situation, the raspy-voiced populist has moved far ahead of Republican challenger Jim Renacci in polls assessing his bid for a third term.\n\nIf Brown wins and Democrats manage to recapture the Senate, Brown stands to chair the Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee \u2014 a worrisome prospect for Wall Street.\n\nBrown's success has placed him squarely in early speculation about Democrats who may seek the presidency in 2020. More than most politicians in his party, he has shown broad appeal among working-class voters \u2013 including the blue-collar whites who represent Trump's political base. That's not merely a matter of personality. Brown sides with Trump's combative posture on trade, backing the president's decision to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, rewrite the North American Free Trade Agreement and confront China with tariffs.\n\nSubscribe to John Harwood's Speakeasy podcast on iTunes\n\nAn avid baseball fan, Brown sat down with me last week at the stadium in Columbus that is home to the AAA farm team for the Cleveland Indians. In an interview that followed the mailing of pipe bombs to prominent Democrats but preceded the mass shooting in a Pittsburgh synagogue, we discussed the nation's political climate, the Democratic economic agenda, his sometime-partnership with the president, and the possibility that he might soon challenge Trump for the White House. What follows is a condensed, edited transcript of our conversation.\n\nSherrod Brown: Welcome to Columbus, and Huntington Stadium.\n\nJohn Harwood: You're a big baseball guy. Give me your No. 1 moment as a player, and your No. 1 moment as a fan.\n\nBrown: My No. 1 moment as a player was pitching two no-hitters in a row in Little League.\n\nHarwood: You were the Johnny Vander Meer \u2026\n\nBrown: Johnny Vander Meer; two in a row. That's right, yeah. This guy knows baseball. Well done. An Ohio team.\n\nAs a fan it had to be the 2016 World Series with Connie and my children, my daughters. We'd started going to games when the Indians really weren't very good. And when Rajai Davis hit a two-run homer I was thrilled. Cleveland came back and tied it.\n\nHarwood: That was the rain delay game.\n\nBrown: Then the rain delay came and the world went to hell. The Indians lost in extra innings, and Hillary lost the election the same week. Oh, well.\n\nHarwood: Several of your colleagues in states that President Trump won comfortably are in trouble this election year. You're in one of those states, but you're not in trouble. Explain that.\n\nBrown: I don't look at voters as Trump voters or Clinton voters. I don't look at workers as white workers or black workers. I talk about workers. In the end, it's whose side are you on. I urge my colleagues always, if there are Democratic majorities, whenever there are, that we really do focus on the dignity of work.\n\nThat is making sure that people who get up every day, work hard, play by the rules, have a decent standard of living. That their wages go up, that their health-care benefits are adequate, that they have some retirement, and that we have to make sure we keep health-care costs down.\n\nThere's no interest in doing that in Washington. Now, their interest is more tax cuts for the rich, more cuts in Medicare. I mean, McConnell's comments in the last couple of weeks \u2014 where three-quarters of the dollars went to the richest 1 percent (and) the way we pay for that is to cut Medicare and Social Security or raise the eligibility age \u2014 that's morally reprehensible, and it's bad economics, and they all should be ashamed of themselves for that.\n\nHarwood: Now, one thing that distinguishes you from your Democratic colleagues is that you have affirmatively worked with Trump on a major policy issue. You support his tariffs. Every recent president in both parties, and every economist that I talk to, have said that tariff policies make no sense economically. That they cost more jobs than they save. Why are you with him?\n\nBrown: Well, respectfully, you need to talk to a wider swath of economists. I think you've got to spool back. And economists don't do this because economists often have a pretty cloistered existence in their lives. You've got to think how we got here. And if you drive through the industrial Midwest, and in the central valley of California, too, you will see example after example of how a company shut down production in Mansfield, my hometown, or Toledo or Dayton, moved overseas, built a plant there and collected a tax break to do it. Because our tax and trade policy has played into that for decades. And no president was willing to address it.\n\nTariffs are a temporary enforcement tool. They're not a long-term trade policy. I would've done it differently from the president. I would not have called it a trade war. I would've explained to the American public what in fact he was doing for the end outcome \u2014 to deal with Chinese cheating, basically.\n\nI would've aimed our tariffs not at our allies \u2014 Canada and Western Europe \u2014 and would have worked with those allies to figure out how you stop Chinese, longtime serial cheating.\n\nHarwood: But isn't the lesson of the modern world continuously in one direction \u2014 that is, toward the freer movement of people and capital? And aren't you basically trying to make water flow uphill by interfering with the laws of economics on that?\n\nBrown: Well, the laws of economics haven't worked for much of this country in terms of working-class people, regardless of race. It's easy for a professor to preach that. It's maybe even a little fun for the media to echo that. But the fact is that \u2026\n\nHarwood: Bill Clinton and Barack Obama share your values.\n\nBrown: They were wrong. They share my values. I share their values. They were wrong on trade.\n\nHarwood: When you have presidents from both parties \u2014 one fundamentally close to business, the other close to labor \u2014 it tells me they see that for the nation as a whole, expanded trade is good.\n\nBrown: If presidents of each party are in the same place, does that justify the Vietnam War? I don't think because presidents in both parties were in the same place, that makes it good policy. You think trade has nothing to do with the fact that the 1 percent are getting richer and richer and richer?\n\nIn this country, you're seeing profits go up. You're seeing executive compensation go up sharply. You're seeing productivity go up. And wages are flat. A big part of the reason wages are flat is because we have not done globalization well. We've not taken care of people who have lost their jobs. We have not fought for labor rights and environmental rights.\n\nI wear this pin. It's a depiction of a canary in a birdcage. It was given to me at a Workers Memorial Day. It symbolizes the mine worker in the canary. But it symbolizes the role of government to help middle-class people and create and build a middle class.\n\nHarwood: Let me ask you about the word \"socialism\" in our politics. The White House just put out a report the other day attacking socialism, and linking Democrats and Democratic proposals to socialism. Is it a dirty word?\n\nBrown: It's a political calculation that's poll-tested by Karl Rove and whoever is the new Karl Rove in the Republican Party. It's pretty meaningless in terms of the way we do our jobs. I want government on the side of the public. I want government to respect the dignity of work and advocate for workers. I don't really care about labels.\n\nHarwood: You're not scared of that word?\n\nBrown: No, I'm not. I don't think voters think about that stuff.\n\nHarwood: Is Medicare-for-all socialism?\n\nBrown: No. I think the better way to do health care is to allow \u2014 and I've worked on this for years \u2014 Medicare buy-in at 55. That was part of the Affordable Care Act until we fell short of the 60 votes.\n\nLook who is most vulnerable in health care. It's a 58- or a 61-year-old man or woman in Dayton who has lost her job because her plant closed. She's 58. She can't find insurance. And it's a point in her life when her health's getting bad, especially if she worked construction or in a factory or worked in a diner or worked in a hair salon and was on her feet all day. That's when they need Medicare.\n\nHarwood: Is that still what you're for? Not Medicare for all?\n\nBrown: I don't oppose Medicare for all. I've not co-sponsored Medicare for all because I don't think we get there now. I think what we do is Medicare at 55. It's voluntary. It's a buy-in. You can do it, fiscally responsibly, and give that 58-year-old, laid-off woman in Zanesville, Ohio, a chance to buy in to Medicare at a reasonable price at that age.\n\nHarwood: The reason I asked the question about socialism is there does seem to have been a shift in the Democratic debate. When Obama was president, one of his aides told me \"we weren't allowed to use the word 'redistribution'\" \u2014 even though things like Obamacare did redistribute money from people who paid taxes for it to people who got benefits. You, Sen. Harris and others have proposed major redistribution of money to people through the earned income tax credit or other vehicles. Is that something that you see as now politically salable?\n\nBrown: I always have. I mean, the real masters at redistribution are Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, who redistribute income up. That's what they do.\n\nHarwood: Understood. But it has proven easier to do that by cutting someone's taxes than by having government write a check to someone. That's just been the political reality.\n\nBrown: That's their political reality. I'm surprised you buy into it, John.\n\nHarwood: No, what I'm saying is that has proven more politically achievable.\n\nBrown: It's politically achievable because Washington is rigged. Washington can always pass a tax cut for rich people because, who are most members of Congress? Many, many, many of them are millionaires. Who are most of the lobbyists?\n\nAs you may know, John, there aren't a lot of people walking around the halls of Congress that are advocating for workers at the local diner in Garfield Heights. They're advocating for the big power companies and the big drug companies and Wall Street.\n\nHarwood: Do you think the table is set, politically, for Democrats to embrace in a full-throated way that kind of redistribution?\n\nBrown: I hope so. You use the word redistribution. To me, it's fairness. People that work in a diner, people that cut hair, people that work construction, they work every bit as hard as you do and I do. And they get so little to show for it, and they have a government that's not on their side so often.\n\nI don't call that redistribution, I call it justice. I call it fairness. It's what our government should be.\n\nHarwood: Sen. Warren has a proposal to do that more indirectly by requiring, as a condition of corporate charter, worker representation on corporate boards, which would not require government outlays. What do you think of that idea?\n\nBrown: That's fine. I support anything that gets us there. I also have a bill called the Freeloader Fee Act that says when a company \u2014 not a diner with 30 or 40 employees, but a big company of over X-number of people \u2014 pays so little that their workers are eligible for Medicaid, food stamps, housing vouchers and earned income tax credit, that they should pay a freeloader fee.\n\nThey should reimburse taxpayers for their low wages. Their executives are making $6 million, $8 million, $10 million a year, their workers are paid so little that government subsidizes their workers. Those companies should have to pay a penalty for that.\n\nHarwood: Your election is in a little over a week. Immediately, there's going to be a lot of talk and action toward the 2020 race. Sen. Warren says she's going to take a hard look at it after the election. Seems clear she's going to run. What is your thinking on that issue?\n\nBrown: I'm thinking that Sen. Warren's probably going to run. Is that your question?\n\nHarwood: Are you thinking that Sen. Brown's going to run?\n\nBrown: I don't like the idea of running for president. I don't really have any real interest in that.\n\nHarwood: But I saw that you said to one of your home state newspapers you think about it from time to time, and you get people talking to you about it.\n\nBrown: No news on this story, sorry. I don't aspire to be president of the United States. I know my name's mentioned because I win in a Trump state.\n\nHere's what I hope comes out of this election. First of all, I hope to win. Second, I hope that Rich Cordray, who would be a really good governor, wins in the Democratic ticket.\n\nAnd third, I hope the message that I win with \u2013 the dignity of work and whose side are you on \u2013 gets into the national debate. Because plenty of my colleagues want to be president a lot more than I do.", "CNBC's John Harwood on Friday talked with Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, who is up for re-election on Nov. 6. Here, they discuss the increasingly heated political climate in the U.S.\n\nJohn Harwood: We've had this spate of now a dozen potentially explosive devices mailed to people in politics. What do you make of that? I was with your longtime colleague in Ohio politics, John Kasich, yesterday. And he was putting some of the blame on President Trump for things he's said. Do you see it that way?\n\nSubscribe to John Harwood's Speakeasy podcast on iTunes\n\nSherrod Brown: I don't want to point fingers. I have a debate tonight with my opponent. And I will ask him to join me in asking the president to try to unify the country. I remember when President Bush, with whom I vehemently disagreed on trade policy, on tax cuts for the rich, on the Iraq War, right after Sept. 11, went to a mosque because he wanted to unify the country. And I wish this president would stop the divisive rhetoric. And I wish this president would respect your profession. And I'm not saying that because I'm sitting with someone from your profession.\n\nHarwood: You might be married to someone from that profession.\n\nBrown: I am also married to a journalist. But long before that, I never believed that the media were the enemy of the people, or that they don't play an important role. In fact, if anything, the media's role in keeping politicians and business honest has fallen back. There aren't enough reporters at the statehouse in Columbus or at the Capitol in Washington.\n\nThere are not enough investigative reporters nosing around on Wall Street or at capitals. That, to me, is the biggest shortcoming of the media. Not that in any way, they're enemies of the people, but there are not enough of them. The big media companies are making money, but they're not hiring reporters and they're not paying them well. And they're not hiring investigators to do what needs to be done to keep our democracy strong and vibrant.\n\nHarwood: You hear a lot of pessimism these days about the state of our democracy and the political debate. Are you pessimistic, or not?\n\nBrown: I'm really never pessimistic. I think this is a troubled time. I think this president has added to the divisions \u2013 I mean, we were a divided country before Donald Trump, but he's made it much, much worse. We have one network that doesn't really believe in truth-telling, frankly. And the number of people that still believe Barack Obama wasn't born in this country, or the number of people that think John McCain wasn't a hero because he left Vietnam and used his father's connections, when it was exactly the opposite \u2013 that comes from a news organization that has put out those untruths.\n\nMy biggest concern for the country is how we govern. My biggest long-term concern is, first, climate change and this government now, the Republican leadership, has simply failed to acknowledge it. That worries me. I'm worried about the long-term impact on the judiciary, of young, very far-right, very much out-of-the-mainstream judges from district court all the way up to the Supreme Court. It's hard to govern when a quarter of the country gets its news from a source that's not really news. And so, we've got to figure that out as a nation.", "CNBC's John Harwood on Friday talked with Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, who is up for re-election on Nov. 6. Here, they discuss drug pricing.\n\nJohn Harwood: Did you see what the administration announced yesterday about Medicare changing drug reimbursement rates? Is that a good thing? Will it make a big difference?\n\nSherrod Brown: Small step. No.\n\nHarwood: Not a big step?\n\nBrown: It's a small step. The president called it revolutionary with his hyperbole \u2013 no surprise. It is not that. It's a good step. We need to do a lot, lot more. But fundamentally, the White House looks like a retreat for drug company executives.\n\nThey made this step. Drug companies don't really like it. But if that's all they have to accept, they will be pretty happy.\n\nThere are things we should do. Drug companies shouldn't be allowed to deduct the cost of advertising. Drug companies \u2014 we should negotiate the way we do with the VA. It works for veterans. We should serve those who serve us better, and we're doing it at least on drug pricing. We're not doing it on Agent Orange and some other things. But we're doing it on drug prices where the VA negotiates directly with the drug companies to bring prices down. We should do that with Medicare. We should do that with prescription drugs, generally.\n\nSubscribe to John Harwood's Speakeasy podcast on iTunes", "CNBC's John Harwood on Friday talked with Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, who is up for re-election on Nov. 6. Here, they discuss regulating Wall Street.\n\nJohn Harwood: If you guys win the Senate, you'll be the chairman of the Banking Committee. Even if you don't, a potential Democratic takeover of the House would give you more leverage as the ranking member of the Banking Committee. You gave a speech earlier this year where you said that you thought there was something fundamentally rotten in American finance. What is it that's rotten?\n\nSherrod Brown: Well, what's rotten on Wall Street is the influence the financial services industry continues to exert on Congress. Whenever they want something, they almost always get it. There's this collective amnesia that's set in on Congress, especially on Republicans, but a few Democrats, from time to time, where they forgot what happened 10 years ago.\n\nSubscribe to John Harwood's Speakeasy podcast on iTunes\n\nThey forgot that it was Wall Street greed and overreach that cost hundreds of billions of dollars in retirement savings, cost millions of jobs, caused millions of foreclosures. And now, Wall Street comes knocking again. They want to deregulate this administration's appointees to a number of federal regulatory agencies, want to deregulate foreign banks in the United States. They want to weaken capital requirements on Wall Street. They want to weaken the consumer protection bureau.\n\nHarwood: So would your objective be principally to prevent Dodd-Frank from being weakened, or are there affirmative steps beyond Dodd-Frank that you think we should take?\n\nBrown: Well, of course, it's both. You don't allow weakening of the rules that have made Wall Street behave a little better. But there are always new challenges, and especially on capital requirements. And I would add, especially in the consumer protection agency. Rich Cordray, a close friend of mine who happens to be running for governor of this state, made his name as the head of the consumer bureau. And he stood up to Wall Street. We have a head of the consumer bureau now that's been basically a lapdog for Wall Street. And that's a big difference with what's happened in Washington \u2013 Rich Cordray versus a lapdog.\n\nHarwood: But it sounds like it's more of a defensive agenda \u2013 that is, to prevent things that have been done from being dismantled, as opposed to trying to break up banks or reimposing Glass-Steagall.\n\nBrown: Yeah, I have little interest in reimposing Glass-Steagall. That's an answer to a question that's not being asked. Breaking up the banks \u2013 they're too big and too powerful \u2013 that's not on my agenda. My agenda is to, as you say, play defense, to make sure we have a vibrant consumer protection agency. It's to do oversight. I mean, the appointees from the administration to be these regulators are people, some of whom had a lot to do with the housing crisis, and a lot to do with the Wall Street greed and overreach. So you're damn right I play defense when they're trying to do things to undermine the economy.\n\nThe animal spirits of Wall Street will always mean bankers want to take more risk. I don't blame them. They're acting in maybe their stockholders' best interest \u2013 not their communities', but their stockholders' best interest. You need regulators to say no. You need regulators, 120 miles from here on Lake Erie, to make sure people don't dump stuff in Lake Erie. You need regulators to make sure banks don't take too much risk.\n\nThis park is named after a midsized bank, Huntington Bank. They are a good bank.

Officials said that number could reach a maximum of about 8,000 under present plans.\n\nThe troop numbers have been changing at a dizzying pace, with Trump drawing a hard line on immigration in the lead-up to the midterm elections.\n\nJust last week officials were indicating that about 800 to 1,000 might be sent. On Monday, officials announced that about 5,200 were being deployed. The next day, the Air Force general running the operation said more than the initially announced total were going, and he pointedly rejected a news report that it could reach 14,000, saying that was \"not consistent with what's actually being planned.\"\n\nGen. Terrence O'Shaughnessy, the commander of U.S. Northern Command, told reporters the number would exceed the initial contingent of 5,200, but he offered no estimate of the eventual total.\n\nJust 24 hours later, Trump thrust new uncertainty into the picture, catching the Pentagon by surprise.\n\nWith his eyes squarely on Tuesday's contests, Trump has rushed a series of immigration declarations, promises and actions as he tries to mobilize supporters to retain Republican control of Congress. His own Republican campaign in 2016 concentrated on border fears, and that's his focus in the final week of the midterm fight.\n\n\"As far as the caravan is concerned, our military is out,\" Trump said. \"We have about 5,800. We'll go up to anywhere between 10,000 and 15,000 military personnel on top of Border Patrol, ICE and everybody else at the border.\"\n\nLater Wednesday, Trump told ABC News, \"We have to have a wall of people.\"\n\nHis comments were the latest twist in a story that has pushed the Pentagon unhappily into the political space, prompting questions about whether Defense Secretary Jim Mattis was allowing the military to be leveraged as a political stunt.\n\n\"We don't do stunts,\" Mattis said Wednesday.\n\nTrump rejected the idea he was \"fearmongering\" or using the issue for political purposes, but his escalating rhetoric in the waning days of the campaign season calls that denial into question. Trump has railed against illegal immigration, including several caravans of migrants from Central America slowly moving on foot toward the U.S. border. The caravan of an estimated 4,000 people is still nearly 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers) from the border. Several smaller groups, estimated at a combined 1,200 people, are farther away.\n\nTrump insisted the media is underestimating the caravans. \"You have caravans coming up that look a lot larger than it's reported actually. I'm pretty good at estimating crowd size. And I'll tell you they look a lot bigger than people would think,\" he told ABC.\n\nHe has also promised to end so-called catch-and-release policies by erecting tent cities to hold those crossing illegally. And this week he is asserting he could act by executive order to unilaterally end birthright citizenship for the children of non-U.S. citizens.\n\nTrump's comments left some in the Pentagon scratching their heads. Officials said they had no plans to deploy as many as 15,000 troops. The number conceivably could reach 10,000, counting the 2,100 National Guard soldiers who have been operating along the border for months as part of a separate but related mission. The number of active-duty troops tapped for deployment stood at 7,000 as of Wednesday but could reach 8,000.\n\nA deployment of 15,000 would bring the military commitment on the border to roughly the same level as in war-torn Afghanistan. And it would more than double the number of people thought to be in the caravans.\n\nTrump did not back down Wednesday from his controversial proposal to upend the very concept of American citizenship. In a morning tweet, he said the right to citizenship for babies born to noncitizens on American soil \"will be ended one way or the other.\"\n\nHe also claimed that what he terms \"so-called Birthright Citizenship\" is \"not covered by the 14th Amendment.\"\n\nHowever, the text of the amendment's opening Citizenship Clause is this: \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\" The citizenship proposal would inevitably spark a long-shot legal battle over whether the president can alter the long-accepted understanding that the 14th Amendment grants citizenship to any child born on U.S. soil, regardless of his parents' immigration status.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan asserted Tuesday that \"obviously\" Trump could not upend that policy by executive order, drawing a tweeted rebuke from Trump. He said Wednesday that Ryan \"should be focusing on holding the Majority rather than giving his opinions on Birthright Citizenship, something he knows nothing about!\"\n\nSpeaking to reporters before leaving the White House for a campaign rally in Florida, Trump compared his plan to act by executive order to President Barack Obama's much-maligned decision to use executive action to provide protections from prosecution and a path to work status for some people brought to the U.S. illegally as children.\n\n\"If he can do DACA, we can do this by executive order,\" Trump said, using the acronym for the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. Trump and his Justice Department have argued that Obama action was unlawful.\n\nTrump and many top aides have long seen the immigration issue as the most effective rallying cry for his base of supporters. The president had been expected to announce new actions at the border on Tuesday, but that was scrapped so he could travel instead to Pittsburgh, where 11 people were massacred in a synagogue during Sabbath services.\n\nWATCH: Here are the businesses profiting from immigrations enforcement", "Many Chinese military scientists working on strategic research at Western universities have deliberately concealed their ties to the army, according to new research.

The big deadline is mid-December, when European leaders are due to gather once again.

Sadly, this is part of a longstanding pattern, one further amplified by systemic racism. We know this culture well. For every story in the New York Times, there are thousands more, at every level of the company. Most have not been told.\n\n\n\nAs the recent article and the executive response make clear, these problems go all the way to the top. While Google has championed the language of diversity and inclusion, substantive actions to address systemic racism, increase equity, and stop sexual harassment have been few and far between. ENOUGH. Reassuring PR won't cut it: we need transparency, accountability, and structural change.\n\n\n\nOn Thursday, November 1st, Google employees and contractors will walk out in protest, standing up for each other, fighting for equity, and demanding real change:\n\n\n\n1 - An end to Forced Arbitration in cases of harassment and discrimination for all current and future employees, along with a right for every Google worker to bring a co-worker, representative, or supporter of their choosing when meeting with HR, especially when filing a harassment claim.\n\n\n\n2 - A commitment to end pay and opportunity inequity, for example making sure there are women of color at all levels of the organization, and accountability for not meeting this commitment. This must be accompanied by transparent data on the gender, race and ethnicity compensation gap, across both level and years of industry experience, accessible to all Google and Alphabet employees and contractors. Such data must include, but not be limited limited to: information on relative promotion rates, under-leveling at hire, the handling of leaves, and inequity in project and job ladder change opportunities. The methods by which such data was collected and the techniques by which it was analyzed and aggregated must also be transparent.\n\n\n\n3 - A publicly disclosed sexual harassment transparency report, including: the number of harassment claims at Google over time and by product area; the types of claims submitted; how many victims and accused have left Google; any exit packages and their worth.\n\n\n\n4 - A clear, uniform, globally inclusive process for reporting sexual misconduct safely and anonymously. The process today (i.e. go/saysomething) is not working, in no small part because HRs' performance is assessed by senior management and directors, forcing them to put management's interests ahead of employees reporting harassment and discrimination. The improved process should also be accessible to all: full-time employees, temporary employees, vendors, and contractors alike. Accountability, safety and an ability to report unsafe working conditions should not be dictated by employment status.\n\n\n\n5 - Elevate the Chief Diversity Officer to answer directly to the CEO and make recommendations directly to the Board of Directors. In addition, appoint an Employee Representative to the Board. Both the CDO and the Employee Representative should help allocate permanent resources for demands 1-4 and other equity efforts, ensure accountability to these demands, and suggest propose changes when equity goals are not met.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nWHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?\n\n\n\nFor every story in the New York Times, there are thousands more, at every level of the company. Many have not been told. We are part of a growing movement, and we are not going to stand for this anymore.\n\n\n\nWHY ARE CONTRACT WORKERS INCLUDED IN THE DEMANDS?\n\n\n\nMany temps, vendors, and contractors (TVCs) are doing business-critical work without the benefits or recognition, and several do so in the hopes of being able to convert to full-time employment. Coming forward with sexual harassment concerns or other HR complaints (salary/recognition) can significantly jeopardize conversion opportunities, let alone continued employment as a TVC. Remember, TVCs are paid hourly, have very limited benefits, and likely make significantly less than their FTE counterparts.\n\n\n\nThe power structure that inherently diminishes TVCs is rooted in the same foundation of inequality. If we want real change, we have to take action together.\n\n\n\nWHY ARE PRIVILEGED GOOGLE WORKERS WALKING OUT?\n\n\n\nThis is part of a growing movement, not just in tech, but across the country, including teachers, fast food workers, and others who are using their strength in numbers to make real change. We know that it can be more difficult for other workers to stand up which is why we stand in solidarity with the temporary and contract workers here at Google, but we encourage everyone who feels this injustice to take collective action.", "Novo Nordisk CEO: Majority of jobs cuts already done 6:59 AM ET Thu, 1 Nov 2018 | 04:57\n\nDenmark's Novo Nordisk reported weaker-than-expected earnings on Thursday, citing currency headwinds and also announced its plans to cut more than a thousand jobs.\n\nThe drugmaker on Thursday said it plans to cut 1300 jobs by the end of the year in what it described as a \"restructuring initiative\", but what many saw as a means to cut costs amid an increasingly competitive market.\n\nNovo Nordisk CEO Lars Fruergaard J\u00f8rgensentold explained the company's vision, speaking to CNBC's Squawk Box Europe on Thursday.\n\n\"It's important to say that the majority of these job cuts have already been done, so we are simply explaining today that when we get to the end of the year we'll have reduced our workforce by 1300 people,\" he said.\n\n\"We do it to really strengthen our strategic execution, so by being sharp on how we allocate resources, we believe we can grow our strategic brands, our innovative products even stronger in the future, and we can set up our R&D function even stronger going forward.\"\n\nThe world's top maker of diabetes drugs posted net profit of 9.037 billion Danish krone ($1.374 billion) for the three-month period ending Sept. 30 on Thursday.
