But high-yielding securities can come with unexpected risks, CNBC's Jim Cramer warned Monday as stocks traded lower.\n\n\"The risks are enormous if you don't know the pitfalls,\" he told investors. \"As much as we love dividends, they're only worth chasing after if your payout is safe. So if you want some income from your stocks, you need to watch out for red flags.\"\n\nThe first red flag is when a company has a very high dividend yield, Cramer said. That tends to mean that investors, worried about potential dividend cuts, have been selling the stock and pushing the dividend yield percentage higher.\n\nBut the more insidious warning sign is when a company offers an attractive dividend, but can't pay it consistently because it has loads of debt and poor fundamentals, the \"Mad Money\" host said.\n\nThat was what \"doomed the payouts\" at beer manufacturer Anheuser-Busch InBev and ailing industrial General Electric, Cramer said, pointing to the stocks' recent weakness to cement his point.\n\nBudweiser parent Anheuser-Busch, for example, has accumulated a $109-billion \"mountain of debt\" from a series of large-scale acquisitions. In the company's latest earnings report, which was weaker than expected, management said it was going to \"rebase\" the dividend, cutting the 5.2 percent yield down to 2.6 percent.\n\n\"The problem? Less than 25 percent of BUD's sales come from the United States, and the dollar ... has been very strong lately, [which] means all of their sales in euros or pesos have to translate ... into fewer greenbacks,\" Cramer explained. \"They need to take severe action in order to keep paying their dollar-denominated debts. It's an ugly situation. No wonder the stock got pulverized.\"\n\nIn the case of GE, former CEO John Flannery halved the dividend a year ago, bringing the 24-cent yield down to 12 cents as the company grappled with multi-billion-dollar charges tied to its struggling business segments. When former Danaher chief Larry Culp replaced Flannery as CEO in October, he cut the dividend down to 1 cent after realizing that GE's problems were worse than expected.\n\n\"This was totally predictable, ... [but] many investors got burned,\" Cramer said. \"The bottom line? There is no such thing as a large dividend you can take for granted. Just like we saw with BUD and GE, a hideous balance sheet and slowing fundamentals are a toxic brew that can put your dividend in danger. So if you want income, watch for that or else you might just get burned.\"", "While Starbucks can't shield itself from the outcomes of the U.S.-China trade war, the company can continue to play \"the long game\" when it comes to China, Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson told CNBC on Monday.\n\n\"We haven't seen any significant impacts from the geopolitical situation between the U.S. and China, but that said, we're not immune,\" he told CNBC's Jim Cramer on \"Mad Money.\" \"But because we really have built Starbucks in China for China, it really is operating as an entity in China that's relevant to the consumer, to the culture, and we're playing the long game.\"\n\nChina has been a focal point for Starbucks as the coffeemaker's second-largest market after the United States. In August, Starbucks announced a partnership with Alibaba Group, China's largest technology company, to boost its digital and physical presence in the People's Republic.\n\nIn early November, just after Starbucks reported better-than-expected earnings and revenues for its fiscal fourth quarter, Johnson told CNBC's Eunice Yoon that management would start applying lessons it learned from the Chinese market to its U.S. business. In that interview, Johnson stated his intention to play \"the long game\" in China.\n\n\"We operate in 78 countries around the world and so we deal with geopolitical situations all the time,\" Johnson told Cramer on Monday. \"I think by engaging with an attitude of optimism and 'How can we collaborate to create a better environment for all,' we can find great paths forward.\"\n\nThe CEO added that there's \"still more to do\" to push Starbucks' business back into growth mode, reiterating a point made on the company's fourth-quarter conference call.\n\nBut with a multi-billion-dollar partnership with Nestle to sell Starbucks' products outside its official locations on the books and several \"business-simplification\" initiatives in progress, Johnson said he sees a bright outlook ahead of his company.\n\n\"The Global Coffee Alliance with Nestle is something that is just now kicking in and I think that's going to pay dividends for years and years to come for Starbucks and for Nestle,\" he said, adding that Starbucks' \"aggressive\" share buyback was a message to Wall Street that its \"growth-at-scale agenda\" is going to work.\n\n\"Much of this buying back our stock is the acknowledgment that we think we've got one of the world's most admired and trusted brands, and we've got the right strategy to really drive the growth agenda here over the next several years,\" the CEO said.\n\nStarbucks' stock slid 1.01 percent amid marketwide weakness on Monday, settling at $67.91 a share.

In order for the stock strategist to ring the alarm about impending recession, he said he'd need to see a sharp rise in inflation and interest rates. But because of lethargic inflation, there has been a trend lower in volatility and longer expansion phases.\n\nThe Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the PCE price index excluding the volatile food and energy components, rose 0.2 percent in September after being flat in August.\n\nThat left the year-on-year increase in the so-called core PCE price index at 2.0 percent for a fifth straight month. The metric rose above the central bank's 2 percent inflation target in March for the first time since April 2012.\n\n\"Our view about the prospects for low returns is based on the idea that, without a recession, a bear market is not very likely,\" Oppenheimer concluded. \"While the likelihood of negative returns rises as growth slows, it doesn't\n\nbecome high until GDP growth is below 1 percent.\"", "Democrat Mike Levin, an environmental attorney, is the apparent winner of California's 49th Congressional District seat being vacated by retiring 10-term GOP Rep.

The company also announced it had agreed to allow French regulators to investigate how the company uses humans and technology to moderate and remove user content.\n\nWATCH: Bots, humans both spreading false narratives online before elections", "On Monday, an ABC News reporter caught Cohen on video walking through the Union Station railroad complex on Capitol Hill in Washington, accompanied by Petrillo.\n\nCohen did not respond to a series of questions fired at him during the video, including ones asking why he was in Washington, whether he was meeting with Mueller, or whether he was going to \"meet with the president.\"\n\nCohen kept a deadpan look on his face during all the questions except for the last, when he was asked how his train ride was.\n\n\"The train was great,\" Cohen cracked, flashing a grin.\n\nPetrillo did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNBC.\n\nRead more: Democrats are waiting for a Mueller report that may never come\n\nMueller is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, possible coordination between the Kremlin and the Trump campaign, and potential obstruction of justice by Trump himself.\n\nThe president has repeatedly called Mueller's investigation a \"witch hunt\" and denied any wrongdoing by him or his campaign.\n\nThe White House also has denied Trump had an affair with porn star Stormy Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, or with former Playboy model Karen McDougal. Cohen paid $130,000 to Daniels on the eve of the 2016 presidential election for her silence about the alleged tryst with Trump. McDougal received $150,000 that same year from the publisher of the Trump-friendly supermarket tabloid The National Enquirer, which did not publish her account of a relationship with the president before Election Day.\n\nLast week, Trump forced out Attorney General Jeff Sessions and installed Matthew Whitaker as acting attorney general in his place. The president had often publicly criticized Sessions for recusing himself from the Russia probe.\n\nWhitaker's appointment put him in charge of Mueller's case. It also led to calls by a number of members of Congress to allow the special counsel to complete his work unimpeded.\n\nWatch: Mueller's investigation could make money for taxpayers", "President Donald Trump plans to meet with his trade team on Tuesday to discuss a draft report on European auto tariffs, according to Bloomberg News, citing three people familiar with the matter.\n\nTrump's focus remains on crushing foreign automakers with heavy tariffs, according to an Axios report earlier on Monday. The president reportedly sees the threat of auto tariffs as a successful negotiating tactic. Trump used the auto tariffs threat when he negotiated with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau earlier this year.\n\n\"Trump says gleefully that the moment he started talking about maybe tariffs on cars, that [European Commission President Jean-Claude] Juncker got on the fastest plane known to mankind, comes straight over to Washington and starts offering deals,\" a senior European official told Axios.\n\nGeneral Motors shares turned negative after the report, falling as far as $35.45 in trading.

That means, if you earn $50,000 per year, by your 35th birthday, you should have around $100,000 socked away.\n\nThese should be funds you've allocated for the future, including anything in a retirement account such as a 401(k) or Roth IRA and any company match. You can also include other amounts you have in long-term investments in index funds or with robo-advisers.\n\nTo get to that number, Fidelity recommends saving 15 percent of your annual income between what you put away and what percentage, if any, your employer matches. And make sure to invest these funds instead of leaving them in a traditional low-interest savings account. \"If you only saved money in an account that got no return, you'd have to save a lot more to reach your goal,\" Meghan Murphy, a VP at Fidelity, tells CNBC Make It.", "Stop me if you've heard this one before: An Apple analyst cuts iPhone shipment estimates based on weak supplier guidance, sendingthe company's stock tumbling.\n\nThat's the situation Apple was in Monday. Shares fell 5 percent, leading the overall market to painful declines, after iPhone supplier Lumentum cut its outlook.\n\nIt's far from the first warning about iPhone shipments from the industry's top analysts. This time it's TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo cutting estimates for the iPhone XR. In October, it was Goldman Sachs and estimates for the company's sales in China. Before that, it was Nikkei, Citi Research or Barclays Capital, lowering their respective estimates for the iPhone X, the iPhone 8 or the iPhone 5 over the years.\n\nThe regular concerns around iPhone demand have become close to routine for Apple as global smartphone sales slow and upgrade cycles grow longer. Apple beats consensus estimates for shipments anyway most quarters.\n\nIn 2013, after Barclays lowered iPhone sales estimates, citing \"our checks in the supply chain,\" Apple reported 2.4 million more units shipped than the research firm predicted. In 2017, Citi called iPhone demand \"modest\" and \"tempered,\" and Apple beat Wall Street projections for iPhone shipments by about 1 million.\n\nAhead of Apple's fiscal second-quarter report in May, the company's market value dropped by more than $60 billion in just three trading sessions, and at least five analyst firms adjusted estimates. Reported shipments fell just shy of consensus estimates, but analysts admitted they were overly panicked.\n\nAs early as 2013, Apple CEO Tim Cook was warning against taking supply chain rumors to heart. He addressed rumors of reduced orders on the company's earnings call for its fiscal first quarter of 2013, saying:\n\nI would suggest it's good to question the accuracy of any kind of rumor about build plans and also stress that even if a particular data point were factual, it would be impossible to accurately interpret the data point as to what it meant for our overall business because the supply chain is very complex. And we obviously have multiple sources for things, yields might vary, supplier performance can vary, the beginning inventory positions can vary. I mean, there's just an inordinate long list of things that would make any single data point not a great proxy for what's going on.\n\nIn short, Cook said Apple's network of suppliers is deep and complicated. One supplier cutting its outlook doesn't necessarily mean iPhone demand is down.\n\nOf course, it'll be harder to see how Apple stacks up against reports of declining sales when it reports earnings for the December quarter. The company said earlier this month it would stop breaking out individual sales figures for the iPhone, iPad and Mac. However, revenue and profit growth could still be a good indicator as to how well the overall iPhone business is doing as Apple tries new strategies to charge more for each device and layer paid digital services on top of each gadget it sells.\n\nIf history is any guide, analysts and investors tend to get unnecessarily spooked over one-off iPhone supplier rumors, just to be proven wrong after Apple discloses sales.", "The market sold off big today\u2014here\u2019s what four experts say investors should be watching 4:11 PM ET Mon, 12 Nov 2018 | 02:10\n\nThe reasons for investors to be pessimistic are beginning to pile up just as quickly as the market has been sliding down.\n\nA once-pristine fundamental backdrop suddenly looks tarnished, as worries accelerate that economic growth may have peaked, political headwinds are forming, and rising interest rates will stand in the way of future fiscal stimulus from the Trump administration.\n\nWhile stocks had been staging a mild relief rebound in November, Monday's sharp decline shows that the market remains temperamental. All it took was a negative headline for Apple about iPhone demand and news about a lingering regulatory issue for Goldman Sachs to send Wall Street into another tailspin.\n\nThe market's vulnerability has become a common theme among market pros warning their clients not to take too much risk in the current climate.\n\n\"Ongoing risks keep us cautious and we continue to recommend that investors pare back risk if their equity holdings are above longer-term strategic allocations,\" senior strategists at Charles Schwab warned clients in a report Monday. \"Economic and earnings growth rates may be peaking, while the labor market continues to tighten. This mix contributes to higher wage growth, possibly higher inflation and related uncertainty with regard to Fed policy.\"\n\nThose are but some of the risks on invevstors' minds these days.", "Stocks are at a turning point, and it could be Apple and other technology names that help decide whether the market revisits October lows.\n\nThe S&P 500 was down about 2 percent Monday, at 2,726, and technical analysts say it needs to hold a level just above 2,700 or it could drop about 100 points to test recent lows. The S&P touched an intraday low of 2,603 on Oct. 29.\n\n\"If the market is going to show commitment to the recent rally, then 2,700 holds, and if 2,700 doesn't hold, everyone and their mother is going to be talking about a retest of 2,603, and one thing to watch is Apple. If Apple goes past $190, and goes into the $180s, you're talking about a retest of the lows,\" said Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com.\n\nThe S&P 500 also fell back below its 200-day moving average of 2762, a signal to some strategists the longer term trend could really be changing.\n\nStrategist said investors have not shown enough fear, and there's been no true capitulation in the sell off. \"Excluding today, the bounce from the 29th to Friday, this 8 percent move was not accompanied by resounding internals. That left us a little uncomfortable,\" said Todd Sohn, technical analyst at Strategas Research. \"I think there's a debate here, a possibility [the lows] are in play.\" But he said the market could also retest the February low of 2,530.\n\n\"The other thing is when you look at risk appetite, it hasn't been there.

Cindy Hyde-Smith in the Nov. 27 Senate special election runoff. Hyde-Smith, who was appointed to replace retired GOP Sen. Thad Cochran earlier this year, hopes to serve the remainder of her predecessor's term through 2020.\n\nThe Mississippi race will not swing control of the Senate on its own. With at least three projected pickups of Democratic seats in last week's election, the GOP will hold its majority in the chamber. However, an Espy shocker would give Republicans one fewer vote in a chamber that has seen its share of razor-thin votes since President Donald Trump took office in January 2017.\n\nThree Senate results are still outstanding: the race for Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson's seat in Florida, as well as the contests for GOP-held seats in Arizona and Mississippi. If the current leaders or favorites, including Hyde-Smith, win in all of those states, Republicans would expand their Senate majority to 53-47.

When the Justice Department revamped the rules relating to special prosecutors in the late 1990s, it was largely in response to criticisms leveled against the highly public reports issued by Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel who investigated President Bill Clinton.\n\nIn a section-by-section discussion of the special counsel regulations, published in the Federal Register in 1999, the Justice Department said that the \"principal source of the problems\" with previous independent counsel reports was that they were typically \"made public, unlike the closing documentation of any other criminal investigation.\"\n\nThe department found that the requirement led prosecutors to \"over-investigate\" in order to avoid public backlash for \"not having turned over every stone.\"\n\nThe special counsel regulations also call for a report to members of Congress from the attorney general. That report, which will be submitted by acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker unless he is replaced before Mueller finishes his work, is expected to be sparse on detail.\n\n\"These reports will be brief notifications, with an outline of the actions and the reasons for them,\" the Justice Department said in its 1999 report.\n\nThe special counsel's office declined to comment for this article.", "Shares of semiconductor manufacturer Nvidia plummeted in after-hours trading on Thursday after its earnings report, but some see the name heading higher even as the group faces tariff-related vulnerabilities.\n\nA string of sell-offs in the past week has taken the S&P 500 down to critical levels.

The scale of his imagination was only exceeded by the size of his heart.\"\n\nLee's work creating characters for Marvel spanned the 1960s and into the early 1970s. But Lee was still involved with the production of the films based on his comics, and regularly made brief, tongue-in-cheek cameos within the movies.\n\nHe became known for imbuing in his heroes the sort of flaws that were rarely visible among other comic-book protagonists, such as jealousy, pride and even financial constraints.\n\nHis voice often extended beyond the comic panel, as well, notably in his monthly \"Stan's Soapbox\" column.\n\nLee was also a World War II veteran, having served in the signal corps. His official Twitter account's last post commemorated Veterans Day.\n\nTesla co-founder and CEO Elon Musk, who has mentioned his interest in visual arts in the past, also paid tribute to Lee.\n\nAsked on CNBC in 2014 if comic-book films were over-saturating Hollywood, Lee said, \"Oh, I don't think it's enough.\"\n\n\"I think that they'll just go on as long as we come up with good stories for them,\" he added.", "Limiting the use of Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat directly leads to reductions in loneliness and depression, according to a recent study published by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nThe study is titled \"No More FOMO: Limiting Social Media Decreases Loneliness and Depression,\" and as part of it, researchers observed 143 undergraduate students over three weeks.\n\nThe students were split into two groups: one that continued to use social media as normal and another that was limited to using each social service to 10 minutes per day. Students sent researchers screenshots of their iPhone battery usage, which shows how many minutes are spent on each app each day, to track their usage of the apps.\n\nThe experiment found that among the group that limited its use of social media, the researchers saw significant declines in depressive symptoms.\n\n\"Not comparing my life to the lives of others had a much stronger impact than I expected, and I felt a lot more positive about myself during those weeks,\" one of the students said, according to the study.\n\nFacebook could not be reached for comment.

The $34,000 base price includes features many other cars would only offer as options, such as forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking and lane-keeping assist, which helps redirect cars that drift out of their lane.\n\nThe car also looks cool, Muzio said. \"We really liked the overall vibe,\" he said. \"It is very much a Volvo. It has a distinct aesthetic.\" He said the car has a unique roof design and little touches, like small strategically placed Swedish flags.\n\n\"It really feels like you are driving something special,\" Muzio said.\n\nOne of the things the team considered was the fact that customers can subscribe to the car for a price starting at $650 via Volvo's Care subscription service.\n\nAll-inclusive subscription services that roll up car payments, maintenance costs and insurance are a new model for the auto industry, and some have had mixed results. Cadillac in November confirmed plans to suspend its subscription program. But Volvo's subscription model is a strong value for customers, Muzio said.\n\nThis is the fifth year of the Kelley Blue Book Best Buy Award, and the survey has already expanded and changed to reflect the shifts in consumer tastes toward SUVs and trucks. For example, this is the first year the group has offered a luxury subcompact SUV category, Muzio said.\n\nThe Best New Car awards rank vehicles in 14 different categories, such as best compact, pickup truck, minivan and luxury car. Other category winners included the Hyundai Veloster N in the performance category, the Ford Expedition in the full-size SUV category, and two Audi SUVs, the Q5 and Q7, in the compact and mid-size luxury SUV categories, respectively.\n\n\"The trick with buying a car is that it really is a bit of a journey, and we want to give people a good place to start,\" he said.", "Eventbrite's first earnings report on Monday could draw the interest of one particular company: Square.\n\nThat's because Square owns a small ownership stake in Eventbrite that more than doubled in value over the past year.\n\nSquare disclosed in a public filing last week that the $25 million investment it made in Eventbrite last year has more than doubled in value to $61.9 million. The huge gain helped Square turn its first quarterly profit of $20 million in the third quarter.\n\nThe ownership stake adds another reason why some investors are so bullish on Square, whose stock has roughly doubled in price this year. While Square has a healthy core payments business, the investment in Eventbrite shows how it's diversifying its business in many different ways, including lending and food delivery.\n\nThe gains also highlight the business-savvy of Sarah Friar, Square's former CFO, who recently stepped down to take on the CEO position at Nextdoor, a social-networking start-up focused on neighborhoods. Friar is credited for bring a critical part of Square's business over the years, helping the company go public.\n\nThe value of Square's ownership stake could change substantially following Eventbrite's earnings on Monday. Square noted this in its filing last week, saying the investment could fluctuate significantly \"due to volatility of the investee stock price.\"\n\nSquare's spokesperson wasn't immediately available for comment.", "Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's most-recent attempt to stop his country's massive inflation problems is failing, at least according to one measure.\n\nThe Bloomberg Caf\u00e9 Con Leche Index, which gauges Venezuela's inflation through the price of a cup of coffee, showed an annual inflation rate of 149,900 percent after its latest reading.\n\nThe staggering inflation print comes after the Venezuelan government issued a new currency, the \"sovereign bolivar.\" One sovereign bolivar was worth 100,000 \"old\" bolivars. The purpose of the new currency was to normalize day-to-day transactions as the country battles through years of hyperinflation.

Another concern may be De Beers' artificial diamonds may add competition in the low-end market, though there is no evidence this happened thus far.\n\nDe Beers, which is the world's largest diamond producer, usually changes diamond prices by restricting supply, not reducing prices. The company does not publicize its prices, but the last major cuts, which were in the single-digit percent range, were in 2016 due to economic challenges.

The president has tweeted at the 15-nation producer group several times this year, blaming it for rising oil prices and ordering its members to take steps to tamp down the cost of crude.\n\nTrump's latest broadside comes on the heels of a sharp pullback in oil prices that has seen U.S. crude plunge into a bear market and post its longest losing streak on record. Prices tumbled over the last five weeks as global equity markets sold off, crude supplies rose and the outlook for growth in oil demand weakened.\n\nThe sudden drop in oil prices from four-year highs just last month has forced OPEC and a group of crude exporters including Russia to rethink how they are managing the market.\n\nOn Sunday, a committee representing the group said oil supply is growing faster than demand, suggesting the alliance may have to launch a fresh round of production cuts. The same day, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al Falih said the kingdom's oil shipments would fall by 500,000 bpd in December.\n\nOn Monday, Falih told an oil conference in Abu Dhabi that technical analysis suggests \"there will need to be a reduction of supply from October levels approaching a million barrels\" from the alliance.", "The midterm elections have nearly drawn to a close \u2014 and, without skipping a beat, the 2020 presidential field is starting to burst open.\n\nThe latest politician to join the list of President Donald Trump's potential challengers is Richard Ojeda, who lost the race to represent West Virginia's 3rd Congressional District on Tuesday night.

In October, billionaire and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg re-registered as a Democrat amid speculation that he will run.\n\nBut Ojeda has actually taken the next step. He filed paperwork with the FEC on Sunday night.\n\nOjeda, who supported Trump in 2016 against Democrat Hillary Clinton but has since said he regrets the choice, ran as a hyper-aggressive populist Democrat in one of the most Trump-friendly districts in the country.\n\nTrump won 68 percent of the vote in West Virginia in the 2016 presidential election. In the state, Trump received the most support from the 3rd District, where he trounced Clinton by a spread of 50 percentage points, 73-23.\n\nOjeda fought tooth and nail against Republican Carol Miller for the seat vacated by incumbent Evan Jenkins, who won a seat on the state's Supreme Court of Appeals. Polls of the race curated by RealClearPolitics showed Miller holding a single-digit lead over Ojeda on the eve of Election Day, although he ended up losing by a margin of approximately 56-44, according to NBC News data.\n\n\"To come as close as he did in that district in the state at this time was really something,\" said John Kilwein, chair of the political science department at West Virginia University.\n\nOjeda has drawn comparisons to other Democrats who ran competitive races in deep-red regions, such as Rep. Conor Lamb of Pennsylvania and Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas, who lost in a close contest to GOP Sen. Ted Cruz. Kilwein said Ojeda is a \"more bare-knuckles, kind of paratrooper version\" of Lamb, who won a special election in his Rust Belt district in part by distancing himself from House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.\n\n\"If I don't feel what they are doing is going to benefit the people, they need not darken my doorstep,\" Ojeda said in an intense early campaign video, which spliced together footage of the tattooed former paratrooper lifting weights with images of his own bloodied face after he was viciously assaulted during his 2016 state Senate campaign.\n\nOjeda's aggressive style and no-punches-pulled approach to Trump may not endear him to the president's staunchest supporters. In his concession speech, Ojeda (pronounced oh-JED-uh) tore into Trump for mispronouncing his surname and promised to continue to fight.\n\n\"You called me a stone-cold crazy wacko and then you mispronounced the way I say my name! But make no mistake about it! You're going to know my name,\" Ojeda yelled during the speech. \"I'm Richard Ojeda! I'm Richard Ojeda! I'm Richard Ojeda, and I'm not done fighting, and neither are we!\"\n\nDespite his feisty style, Ojeda doesn't appear set to make much of an impact on the 2020 race. And his announcement left the political world surprised and confused.\n\nWest Virginia University's Kilwein, for instance, said that he was \"taken aback\" by Ojeda's decision to run for president after losing the House race.", "Shares of Comcast slipped Monday after President Donald Trump alleged in a tweet the company \"routinely violates antitrust laws.\"\n\nThe stock lost just under 1 percent by the end of trading Monday, amid overall market declines.\n\n\"American Cable Association has big problems with Comcast.

Facebook is down more than 35 percent from its 52-week high.\n\n\"This is a very serious correction,\" Cramer said. \"We shouldn't be having a correction right now.

Another thing that could be a risk is, as the global economy has been slowing this year, the rising dollar poses a problem for many countries outside the U.S., and that has contributed to the slowdown in growth. The question is whether the U.S. economy can withstand a slowdown in global growth, and I don't think it can in the long run.\"\n\nMarc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex, said the dollar in recent sessions has been getting a boost from the Fed. After last week's meeting, the Fed's statement indicated a rate hike is coming in December and several more could be in store for next year.\n\n\"Broadly, the dollar is at its best levels of the year,\" said Chandler. \"We just got done with earnings season, and many people are afraid earnings peaked, and the stronger dollar just adds to that.\"\n\nPeter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, said margins appear to have peaked at a record 10 percent level for the S&P 500 in the third quarter. Third quarter profits were 28 percent higher for the S&P 500, according to Thomson Reuters. Fourth quarter profits are expected to grow about 18 percent.\n\nBoockvar said the decline in Apple after a key supplier reported slower orders was one catalyst for Monday's decline in stocks. The market was also still reacting to Friday comments from White House trade advisor Peter Navarro, who said any trade deal will be on President Donald Trump's terms.\n\nBut the dollar was also a factor since it plays into a theme of peaking earnings that the market has been worried about.\n\n\"It's another clip to earnings,\" said Boockvar, adding the market was already anxious about higher interest rates. \"You've had low wages. That's reversing. Now you get clipped via higher costs from tariffs, higher transportation costs, and you throw in the stronger dollar. You can make a strong argument that the third quarter was the peak for profit margins.\"\n\nBoockvar said corporate profit margins peaked at lower levels in the last cycles. They topped out at a high of 9.5 percent in the mid-2000s, and at 7.75 percent in the early 2000s, he said.\n\n\"[The dollar] was certainly a factor all through the third-quarter earnings for multinationals. We hear as an excuse that it was the stronger dollar, and the dollar is still below where it was in 2016, even with all these rate hikes,\" said Boockvar. \"I'm not going to believe the dollar is going to run away, but it is a likely factor here.\" Among the companies complaining about dollar headwinds last quarter were Apple and FANG names like Alphabet, he said.", "General Electric CEO Larry Culp acknowledged Monday that his decision to slash the quarterly dividend to a penny sent regular investors scrambling.\n\n\"When we announced on our earnings conference call that we were taking our dividend down to 4 cents a year, we didn't do anything positive for our retail shareholder base and they have been exiting the stock, I think, as a result,\" Culp told CNBC's David Faber on \"Squawk on the Street.\"\n\nBut even with the stock's slide over the past several weeks, Culp says GE \"would make those same decisions today, because those were the right decision to make sure the company is facing forward.\" GE shares have fallen about 20 percent in November, on pace for its worst month of trading since February 2009.\n\nAbout one-third of GE shares are held by retail investors, a higher than average mix for a public company.", "Amazon shares closed in a bear market Monday as the e-commerce giant added to a 20 percent decline from all-time highs reached back in September.\n\nAt Monday's close of $1,636.85 per share, the stock had fallen 20.1 percent from an intraday high of $2,050 per share hit on Sept. 4, 2018.

Very nice to be here and of course, nice to have Larry Culp, the company's Chairman and CEO, with us. Thank you for being with us.\n\nLARRY CULP: Good morning.\n\nFABER: And for having us here.\n\nCULP: Good morning, David, and welcome to Boston on Veterans Day.\n\nFABER: Yes, that's right. Let's get right to it, Larry, in terms of Friday and the action on the stock price, what may be the reason why \u2013 we're very welcome and happy you are willing to talk to us, but a well regarded analyst Stephen Tusa -- who's followed the company for some time, and been typically right in terms of the direction of the stock -- came out on Friday with the new report in which he basically says, I mean a lot of things, but to cut to some of the key ones: $100 billion in net liabilities he sees at Ge, roughly speaking, currently for a company that's generating negative free cash flow, even after the dividend cut, with deteriorating fundamentals. A) Is he getting any of that wrong? And B) if he isn't, what do you tell investors to keep them in the stock?\n\nCULP: RIGHT. Well, David, I think if we look at the last two weeks, right, clearly the stock has been under pressure. No doubt about that. I think when we announced on our earnings call that we were taking take the dividend down to four cents a year, we didn't do anything positive for our retail shareholder base, and they had been exiting the stock, I think, as a result. And, at the same time, we took another unpopular decision, but one that was straightforward and that is to take guidance off the table, given the fact that we didn't really have I think the confidence and conviction that we would want, particularly around our power business, as we look toward the end of the year. That didn't do much for our institutional holders. But I think if you step back from all of that and given the way the stocks traded, I think we'd make those same decisions today because those were the right decisions to make sure that the company is facing forward and dealing with the fact that we do have a lot of leverage. I think we all agree in that regard. But we have a number of options to bring that leverage down overtime and the company is very committed in doing that.\n\nFABER: Yeah, i mean that was a focus to a certain extent of the conference call that took place 11 days ago or where ever we are roughly. And it is also was the focus of Mr. Tusa, though. It wasn't necessarily about liquidity as much as it's what he thinks is success of leverage at GE. And you seem to agree, although the numbers may differ a bit. But what can you do, particularly when it is not just the amount of debt but it's also the fact that IBITA and free cash flow is not going up?\n\nCULP: Right, right. Well a couple of things here, David. One, I think that's an important distinction that you just made relative to liquidity verses leverage. Two weeks ago, folks were I think understandably asking the liquidity question. I think we've put that to rest given the fact we've got 20 billion of cash. We have a robust here too CP program and $40 billion of bank lines. We've only tapped two. But I think that gives us a foundation.\n\nFABER: You've only tapped two of the 40 billion available to you.\n\nCULP: Yes, so that gives us a foundation to really talk to the leverage. And again, whether it's an equity analyst, whether it's the rating agencies -- witness the downgrades, or what we've said ourselves, we need to bring the leverage down. And I think we've got plenty of opportunities through asset sales to do that. In the last six weeks, marks my sixth week on the job, I've heard from a lot of people across our markets, people who have interest in GE assets. And I think that's confirmation that we have quality franchises and frankly that we have options.\n\nFABER: Are you going to quicken the pace of asset sales at this point? Is there a sense of urgency?\n\nCULP: Very much a sense of urgency, David. But as John Wooden, the famous basketball coach said, \"be quick but don't hurt.\" And I think that's the mindset that we have. When we look at healthcare for example, a tremendous franchise, we talked in June about an IPO there where we'd take 19.9% of the proceeds as cash. We have flexibility, we have options there. We could preserve our tax-free spin status while selling up to 49.9%. So there's a lot of cash there, given some of the estimates of value that are out there. We're tracking very well with the closure of our merger with LabTech, with our transportation business. We'll end up with just under 10% of that business in equity. Another option there. And Baker Hughes. A lot of people have talked about Baker Hughes. A $28 billion market cap company as of Friday's close. We own 62.5% of that company. So lots of options just in those three to generate real cash to bring that leverage down.\n\nFABER: Right. On Baker Hughes, why not just move -- why not accelerate that now? People had been focused on it. I know the price of oil are all over the place. I know it may not be the best time from a valuation perspective. But when you referenced it on the conference call, you still use the word, \"several years,\" I think is what I saw here in terms of exiting that position. Why not get moving on that sooner?\n\nCULP: Well, I think we're going try to look at everything and all of our options again with a sense of urgency. What we are not going to talk with great specificity about certain opportunities, certain paths, because we'd rather talk about what we've accomplished after the fact then negotiate in public.\n\nFABER: What should we think about in terms of leverage then? What should investors be focused on? You mentioned, obviously it's a focus for you. You mentioned a couple of markets that are reacting to it. You see the s-spreads have widened as well. Does that concern you?\n\nCULP: Well, I think there are a number of ways to look at our leverage levels. But let me be absolutely clear: we have no higher priority right now than bringing those leverage levels down. It's important to strengthen the balance sheet, it's important for our investors, the rating agencies, everybody with an interest in the future of this company. Not to mention the fact that it is tough for our businesses to play offense as often as they should organically and inorganically with the balance sheet and the shape that it is in.\n\nFABER: Another of the contentions made by Mr. Tusa, and some other investors to be fair, is that fundamentals continue to deteriorate, not in aviation, not in healthcare but in power. And I mean in the numbers that Tusa had in terms of your potential earnings, I know you're not giving guidance \u2013 35 cents a share in 2019 and 41 cents a share in 2020. When you see or hear those numbers, does it make you shiver?\n\nCULP: No. It is a cold morning here in Boston but I haven't shivered yet. Because we are working hard with the power team to get better grounding in our reality and we aim to run that business differently. I don't have the conviction to offer up numbers for the fourth quarter let alone '19 but we will in time, right. And that's very much what this week's about, it's what this last week -- six weeks have been about, in terms of getting closer to opportunity and challenges in that business. The unfortunate thing there, David, is we probably held on -- with the benefit of hindsight -- held on too long to a too robust revenue outlook for the year. We're going to fall short of that. That hides a lot of the progress the team has made in terms of cost reduction. We've taken out over 700 million of cost in that business this year. We reduced our facility footprint by 20%. Good things to doing a manufacturing business. But it is not enough.\n\nFABER: Has power bottomed?\n\nCULP: Has power bottomed? We're getting close. We're getting close.\n\nFABER: You're getting close. Will you know when you are there?\n\nCULP: We will know when we're there. Right. Because like any business facing both cyclical and secular pressures, it's a little bumpy on the way down, somewhat unpredictable, but I think we have a good line of sight, we can have a good line of sight in this business. We have $94 billion of backlog, for example. That should give us, I think, the potential to run this business not only better but with better visibility.\n\nFABER: And I've mentioned of course, you were the director as of April, you've been in the CEO job, as you pointed out, just about six weeks.\n\nCULP: Six weeks.\n\nFABER: Have you, though, in your mind diagnose of what the issues were at power so you can effectively deal with them and get to the bottom quickly and potentially start to pave the way forward?\n\nCULP: David, I have done this long enough to know that there are always things you may not know. But I feel pretty good today that we've got line of sight on the issues that we can manage to improve the performance of the business and address the risk inherent in it. One of the things we are going to do that we announced on the earnings call is really stop managing the business at a consolidated power level and really run the seven discrete P&L's on their own bottoms. We have a big power organization. Consumes about 300 million dollars of costs per year. And when you are managing at a consolidating levels, it really robs you the visibility relative to revenue, cost and cash opportunities, business by business by business. So as we do that, we're going be able to address the specific issues in each business, and our gas franchise and in other businesses within the power segment.\n\nFABER: Have you been bringing in new people? Do you need to continue to change up personnel?\n\nCULP: The team is going to continue to evolve. I have said on the earnings call and I will say it again today, I have been impressed with the people on the GE team. They're smart, they're talented, they're passionate, and I think they've got an above average level of grit and resilience given what they've been through. But that said, we are bringing in new people, we have in GC, Mike Holston from Merck who joined us earlier this year; Tom Timko, our new controller, from General Motors, is a tremendous addition to the team. We brought in a number of outside advisors who are helping. And there will be other changes as well as we evolve the organization. Some folks perhaps who are here today who will be in different roles. Others who will be promoted as we complement their strengths and their skills with folks from the outside.\n\nFABER: Did the Austin deal break power or was power already on a road that might have ended not well?\n\nCULP: David, it's a hard one to answer. But I think if you step back and look at the hand Russell Stokes and his team were dealt a little over a year ago, I think there are three things in play. First, the secular and the cyclical pressures as we go through the energy transition in that space. And then again, the way we restructured and the way we had been running this business. Those things, relative to market, are our reality, we need to embrace them in order to change them. But in terms of our own operation, we have a lot in our control as a former GE Chairman once said, we can control our destiny in that regard. And that's what we aim to do.\n\nFABER: You know, a little more than a year ago, I sat with your predecessor Mr. Flannery not -- right around the corner here, we didn't do it in this exact spot, he talked about sort of having a handle on power. What gives you the confidence, given you experience that you have the handle on?\n\nCULP: Well, I have run businesses from over 25 years. From the shop floor, from the lab from the customer sights. So I take a bottoms up approach. I could be wrong but I have a lot of confidence of what we can do to stabilize power and then drive a better performance in terms of the top line, the bottom line, and most importantly, David, in terms of the cash generation of that business. We have seven billion dollars of cost in that business today. Our inventory returns are only 4x. Plenty of opportunity to run that business better.\n\nFABER: Now you do you have two other business that we tend not to speak as much because they're doing fine. Aviation of course which everyone calls the jewel to a certain extent and health care. You just had alluded to the plan for health care in terms of potentially taking 19.9% of it public at some point. You've said the plan is intact, the one that the board agreed with and came to back in June of this year. Is there a chance the plan will change?\n\nCULP: Well, what I would say, David, is that I think the strategic intent that we announced in june stands today. And I believe deeply in what we said then and what we reiterated two weeks ago. The plan basically has two strategic pillars. The first, deleveraging. And we've talked about how important it is. The second is we want to run the company differently. We want to be a more detraditionalized business, focused more on the discreet businesses like aviation and healthcare and less on corporate. The details as to how we get there, 19.9% of healthcare or something more, maybe something in one of the other businesses. We have lots of options. So those detailed tactical implementation decisions are under review. And gonna we're be smart about how we faze and sequence those moves. But they all serve the strategic intent that again is a constant.\n\nFABER: And what about aviation? Does it just stay? Can it not be potentially removed? Is there not an opportunity in some way perhaps to break out or monetize a bit of it to show some value and raise some equity?\n\nCULP: Well, there are lots of opportunities here. And I wouldn't dismiss anything once and for all. I think that would be foolish. But there is no question as you said a moment ago, aviation is our crown jewel. David Joyce, our Vice Chair, and his team have done a tremendous job with that business. Have I think tremendous runway going forward, so we wouldn't say no for all time for various options. But options along the line of what you just described, not high on our list.\n\nFABER: So you know, your customers in aviation sign up for long-term agreements, they need to know you're going to be there to service all those jet engines and everything. Are you hampered at all in the marketplace by a deteriorating credit rating and by perhaps the longer term concerns of some of those customers?\n\nCULP: David, the customers I've talked to could not be supportive. They certainly understand we're under a lot of scrutiny, we receive a good bit of criticism. But when I talk to them, what they ask me is \"What can I do to help? At the operating level, you're performing well for us. We need Ge. Ge is important to our business. GE is important for the country. If there is anything that we can do, let us know.\" In terms of our degree freedom from an operating perspective, the businesses are up and operating without any challenge in that regard. And that's been a pleasant finding.\n\nFABER: You know for many years for following and actually being an employee of the company as well. The conglomerate model was lauded -- it was seen as a positive. In other words, the performance of one business actually in some ways helped the others. It would seem to me now to be going the other way. You have two strong businesses you have one weak business, and I wonder can you retain and attract the talent you need and maintain morale when in some ways you seem to not be able to say, \"Well, if you do great in aviation, you are going to do great to GE.\" Because you are attached to the power business and GE Capital and long-term liabilities and things we don't know about that conceivably could impact your future.\n\nCULP: Right. David, there is no question that with the stock where it is and the criticism that we've received that the employees feel that, right. More so in the U.S. than outside of the U.S. But again I think what I have seen is a level of commitment, a level of grit and resilience to fight, to continue to serve customers, to be a part of the mission that we have and to serve the greater GE. Nobody is happy with where we are today. They want their company to be on better footing and that's what we're working to do every single day.\n\nFABER: Can you attract the people you need to and keep the people that you want to keep as well in that environment?\n\nCULP: Well, we have to prove that out. I have been encouraged by the response i have gotten from folks that I have reached out to, the folks that have basically contacted me directly. Not everybody is going to be attracted to a challenge like this, particularly given where we are today. But the people that we want frankly David are \u2013 because they don't scare easy. They're up for the fight and they're ready to fight and win.\n\nFABER: You know, that brings me to you. You are 37-year-old CEO and 14 years later, great track record at Danaher. Compounding of revenues of the stock price, many people would look and say -- what are you doing this for? Why would you take this on given you had a strong reputation, you would made plenty of money it would seem \u2013 not to be presumptuous. What would motivate somebody to do this?\n\nCULP: Well, David, I think it was not an easy decision -- to join the board, frankly, let alone when the board asked me to consider becoming Chair and CEO to take this on. But I think the decision points in both instances were driven by the same logic. I think first and for most, I know having looked at the company for a long time, GE is important. What we do in terms of aviation and healthcare and energy, it is important and frankly this company matters, particularly to the United States. This is a challenge of a lifetime given where we find the company today and that's certainly worth doing as well. But more than anything, I think I go back to the annual meeting in April, my first board meeting, where I began to see GE shareholders and GE employees and pensioners, people who have been working for the company second or third generation, all very unhappy with where we are but again committed to the company, can't wait to see the company be in a better place. And I thought if I can be helpful, if I could serve those people, that'll be a good thing doing at 55.\n\nFABER: But you're going to be at potentially for a long time. There's no magic bullet here. It is not like we're all -- you're going to wake up tomorrow and suddenly have it all figured out and the stocks going to be double. It is going to take, if you are even right, a long period time to turn this giant around, isn't it?\n\nCULP: Exactly. And that's the beauty of having 14 years in the chair in a prior role and being 55. I've got, I think, the energy and the runway to do what it takes here. It's been six weeks, it's been a great six weeks, frankly, it's been energizing. But we did not get where we are in six weeks so it is going to take a while. And I am signed up to do that.\n\nFABER: Finally, Larry, you know, when it comes to the stock itself and I hear from a lot of people as you might expect in the halls of 30 rock as well, fellow colleagues who owned GE and have for many years and they're obviously disappointed, but when you talk to other potential investors, they still feel sort of uncomfortable because of the unknown. And that comes back to GE Capital. Long-term liabilities. Long-term care liability, for example. Can you give people comfort? Do you feel like as having been a director since April and CEO for the last six weeks that you know where all the liabilities are and that the numbers are the numbers with no surprises?\n\nCULP: David, I think that if you look at capital, our intent there is clear. We know have too debt overall. We have too big a Ge Capital business which is why we've been materially shrinking that business down 25 billion this year. That work will continue. We've got a number of great assets there and it is important that people remember. We've got assets that match the liabilities. It is a match book set up. Specific to insurance we took a big charge last year as we trued up our --\n\nFABER: -- Which scared the heck out of people to be fair.\n\nCULP: -- I think there was nobody who heard that news did not have their breath stop for a moment, right, again, a big number. But in terms of what we are doing there, no issues of capital gets more attention: in our management meeting, with our discussions with outside actuaries, frankly at the board meeting. I can't think of a board meeting this year where we haven't spent a good amount of time on managing that insurance obligation. And as we go forward while it is not a liquidity pressure in the short term, we know we need to tend to that and overtime we're fully committed to exploring every option that we can to manage that liability and derisk it for the GE shareholder.\n\nFABER: And finally, Larry, this idea of a large shareholder or somebody coming in to help you in terms of an equity check and giving confidence, is that a possibility or is that not something that's on the table?\n\nCULP: Well, the stock is on sale today. And I am sure people are buying it here at the market is open. But we have no plans for an equity raise, David. I think that as conditions change in the future we might come back and reconsider that. But we are very keen to deleverage. We think we have a path by way of the asset sales to do that. And that's the plan we're going to work.\n\nFABER: Larry, very much appreciate you having us in today.\n\nCULP: Thank you, David.\n\nFABER: Larry Culp, the Chairman and CEO of GE.\n\nFor more information contact:\n\nJennifer Dauble\n\nCNBC\n\nt: 201.735.4721\n\nm: 201.615.2787\n\ne: jennifer.dauble@nbcuni.com\n\nEmma Martin\n\nCNBC\n\nt: 201.735.4713\n\nm: 551.275.6221\n\ne: emma.martin@nbcuni.com", "Why this expert says tobacco companies are still defensive stocks 6:28 PM ET Fri, 9 Nov 2018 | 03:16\n\nBritish American Tobacco, which sells market leading menthol cigarette Newport, is seen as the most vulnerable company. Menthol cigarettes accounting for between 55 percent and 60 percent of its U.S. volumes, driving 25 percent to 27 percent of its global profit, according to estimates from Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Lavery. He estimates menthol cigarettes are about 18 percent to 20 percent of BAT's cigarette volumes and about 15 percent to 17 percent of profits.\n\nBAT's operating profit is about 10 billion pounds (US$12.86 billion) on a run-rate basis, Lavery said. Last year, the company recorded an adjusted operating profit of 7.9 billion pounds (US$9 billion), he said, but that did not include a full year of the U.S. business, which BAT gained through its acquisition of Reynolds American.\n\nShares of BAT tumbled nearly 9 percent Monday.

For fiscal year 2017, Imperial Brands reported about 3.8 billion pounds (US$4.89 billion) in operating profit, Lavery said.\n\nImperial Brands' stock fell about 2 percent Monday.\n\n\"Proposals to ban menthol cigarettes in the U.S. have been for the table for many years and we will continue to engage with the FDA on the topic,\" an Imperial Brands spokesman said in an email to CNBC. \"We are aware of last week's renewed media reports regarding menthol tobacco products and will continue to monitor the situation, but until there's a formal update from the FDA, we'll decline to comment further.\"\n\nWells Fargo's Herzog estimates menthol represents about 21 percent of Altria's combustible cigarette volume, which totaled 116.61 billion sticks last year, according to a regulatory filing. Herzog also estimates menthol represents about 18 percent of Altria's total profit, which totaled $9.56 billion last year, according to the filing.\n\nShares of Altria fell 3.5 percent Monday.

He did not have conviction \"to offer up numbers\" for how power will end the year but Culp said GE \"will in time.\"\n\nQuestions about GE's liquidity are understandable, Culp said, given the company's position. But Culp said GE \"put that to rest given that fact the we got $20 billion of cash\" on hand from asset sales.

But parents can step in less often when their children struggle with chores and tasks.\n\nInstead, parents should reframe these moments in their mind, thinking of them as important chances for their children to hone life skills. \"If you jump in and you do it for them,\" says Willink, \"what you're actually doing is literally taking away the ability for them to develop.\"\n\nWillink says this idea holds true for leaders in any situation.

But what is the root of the anxiety? Behavioral science suggests that humans are \"uncertainty reduction\" machines. That's one of the reasons why we can get a reward for putting money at risk in the markets ... that is, if we stay invested.\n\nWhich brings us to the market volatility in the fourth quarter of the year. Headlines relating to the Dow \"plunging\" more than 800 points back on Oct.10 \u2014 and it being the \"worst drop\" since February \u2014 and subsequent ups and downs ever since have left investors quite nervous about what's coming next.\n\nAs behaviorists would predict, these facts lead to concerning questions: Are we experiencing a \"correction\" in the stock market?

Because we tend to overreact.\n\nWhen markets are doing well, we can become euphoric and may \"buy at all-time highs\" to make more money. And when markets are going down, we can become despondent and may \"sell at all-time lows\" to avoid further losses. Overreaction can cause people to fall into a losing strategy \u2014 buying high and selling low. But how are we supposed to know when markets are at an all-time high or at an all-time low?\n\nThe answer is: It is hard to predict and time the markets.

This had meant the impact of sanctions was not as bad as it could have been and so upping production was not as necessary.\n\n\"They (Saudi Arabia) were worried about (the) under supplying of the market and triple-digit oil prices.

We think Qantas is well-positioned to take advantage of that,\" Joyce said.\n\nWhen asked if he had seen any dent in travel sentiment due to an ongoing trade fight between the United States and China, which experts warncould affect economic outlook for much of the region, Joyce said the outlook for Qantas remained positive.\n\n\"Our forward bookings are up 8 percent in value, we're seeing real strong growth across the Australian economy ... and then the inbound tourism and the outbound tourism are still extremely strong,\" he said, adding that the airline's forward bookings would likely help manage higher fuel costs in the next fiscal year.", "Shares of software company Apptio soared more than 51 percent Monday after the company said it had agreed to be bought by private equity firm Vista Equity Partners for $1.94 billion in cash, two years after going public.\n\nThe stock traded as high as $37.80, just shy of the $38-per-share price that Vista offered to take the company private.\n\nThe deal would help the company bring its products to the market faster, Apptio co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Sunny Gupta told Reuters.\n\n\"In the private construct, we look at leveraging Vista's playbook,\" Gupta said. \"They seem to be very committed to accelerating our product innovation cycle to customers.\"\n\nApptio, whose products include cloud-based and hybrid business management software, was founded in 2007 and went public in September of 2016 at $16 per share.\n\nVista, whose private-equity portfolio comprises of mostly software companies, sold marketing software firm Marketo to Adobe Inc for $4.75 billion in September.\n\nThe Apptio deal includes a 30-day \"go-shop\" period, which allows Apptio board and advisers to consider alternative offers, the company said.\n\nApptio had multiple offers from strategic and private investors before it agreed to go with Vista's, Gupta said.

The polarized result of the midterm election, which saw the House swing to Democratic control but preserved the GOP's hold on the Senate, might help spur market gains, Glazer said.\n\n\"Investors' worst case fears were not materialized during midterms,\" Mayflower Advisors' managing director told CNBC's \"Futures Now\" last week. \"A split government may not be what everybody wants, but it may be what investors want.\"\n\nAccording to Glazer, a split Congress should prevent President Donald Trump from getting additional stimulus passed. As a result, Glazer contends it'll put less pressure on the Federal Reserve to get more aggressive with its interest rate hikes.\n\n\"Had the Republicans really swept, you'd have more likely more stimulus coming into the market. [That] was the fear \u2014 whether it's accurate or not. That fear means the potential for higher rates,\" he said.\n\nBut now, that risk is subsiding.

But for one military veteran, it also meant saving his life.\n\nWhile serving as a recruiting officer in New York City, Marine Corps veteran Michael Abrams had the chance to meet and know many military service members. But he told CNBC that one in particular stuck with him. His name was Allen Strifler, an Iwo Jima survivor and former Marine Corps corporal.\n\nStrifler shared with Abrams that he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and that the only thing that got him out of bed was when he got a job. Strifler said that working meant \"he finally had meaning and purpose in his life,\" Abrams recalled to CNBC's \"On the Money\" in a recent interview.\n\nThat anecdote spurred Abrams to launch his nonprofit, called FourBlock, while pursuing his MBA at New York University.\n\nFourBlock offers veterans a free semester-long, university accredited course in nearly 20 cities across the country, with plans to expand to three more. The curriculum, developed in partnership with Columbia University, helps veterans translate their military skills into career opportunities.\n\nEach week, veterans have online lessons, in-person lectures and visits with different businesses to hear from senior executives. Some of the companies that participate include Amazon, Deloitte, Facebook, and JPMorgan.\n\nAbrams said the career transition program is aimed at vets \"to help get them employed with a purpose sooner, so they don't fall down a downward spiral.\"\n\nEach year, approximately 250,000 service members transition from active duty and enter a job market that's quite different from what they are used to in the military.\n\nOverall veteran unemployment reached 2.9 percent in October 2018, and 3.1 percent for post September 11 veterans, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.\n\nWhile those numbers seems low, FourBlock says that nearly 50 percent of veterans leave their first post-military job within the first year, a symptom of the challenges vets face when returning to the civilan workforce. Abrams said veterans may experience the feeling of \"underemployment,\" which happens when a job occupant feel overqualified or underutilized for a specific job.\n\n\"I always preach to vets that they will have to take a few steps back professionally after leaving the service, and beginning a new career, so that they can learn their new trade and corporate culture,\" Abrams told CNBC.\n\nHe added: \"You're starting all over again, you've got to prove yourself, you've got to earn your stripes, and then you gotta move up.\"\n\nThe FourBlock founder explained that veterans need to figure out that they want to do, and must adapt to the corporate culture of their respective jobs.", "Volatility in the oil market could remain: Russian energy minister 2:43 AM ET Mon, 12 Nov 2018 | 01:51\n\nOPEC and non-OPEC exporters must stick to a consistent message if they are to avoid exacerbating wild swings in the oil market, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said Sunday.\n\n\"There is a lot of volatility in the market.

Many other counties were expected to begin the work Monday after a weekend of recount drama in Broward and Palm Beach counties, home to large concentrations of Democratic voters.\n\nThe developments added up to a tumultuous political day in Florida. More than half of Florida's 67 counties began a recount process that's unprecedented even in a state notorious for settling elections by razor-thin margins. State officials said they weren't aware of any other time a race for governor or U.S. Senate required a recount, let alone both in the same election.\n\nIn Broward County, the recount was delayed for hours Sunday because of a problem with one of the tabulation machines. That prompted the Republican Party to slam Broward's supervisor of elections, Brenda Snipes, for \"incompetence and gross mismanagement.\"\n\nBroward officials faced further headaches after acknowledging the county mistakenly counted 22 absentee ballots that had been rejected. The problem seemed impossible to fix because dismissed ballots were mixed in with 205 legal ballots and Snipes said it would be unfair to throw out all the votes.\n\nGov. Rick Scott, the Republican candidate for Senate, filed suit against Snipes. He was seeking a court order for law enforcement agents to impound all voting machines, tallying devices and ballots \"when not in use until such time as any recounts.\" The suit accused Snipes of repeatedly failing to account for the number of ballots left to be counted and failing to report results regularly as required by law.\n\nThe court didn't immediately respond, though the outcry from Democrats was immediate.\n\nJuan Penalosa, executive director of the Florida Democratic Party, accused Scott of \"using his position to consolidate power by cutting at the very core of our democracy.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in Palm Beach County, the supervisor of elections said she didn't think her department could meet Thursday's deadline to complete that recount, throwing into question what would happen to votes there.\n\nThe recount in other major population centers, including Miami-Dade and Pinellas and Hillsborough counties in the Tampa Bay area, has been continuing without incident. Smaller counties were expected to begin reviews between Monday and Wednesday.\n\nState officials said they weren't aware of any other time a race for governor or U.S. Senate required a recount, let alone both in the same election. The recount process in the two nationally watched midterm races is unprecedented even in a state notorious for settling elections by razor-thin margins.\n\nUnofficial results showed Republican former U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis led Democratic Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum by 0.41 percentage points in the governor's contest. In the Senate race, Scott's lead over Democratic incumbent Bill Nelson was 0.14 percentage points.\n\nState law requires a machine recount in races where the margin is less than 0.5 percentage points. Once completed, if the differences in any of the races are 0.25 percentage points or below, a hand recount will be ordered.\n\nAs the recount unfolded, Republicans urged their Democratic opponents to give up and let the state to move on.\n\nScott said Sunday that Nelson wants fraudulent ballots and those cast by noncitizens to count, pointing to a Nelson lawyer objecting to Palm Beach County's rejection of one provisional ballot because it was cast by a noncitizen.\n\n\"He is trying to commit fraud to win this election,\" Scott told Fox News. \"Bill Nelson's a sore loser. He's been in politics way too long.\"\n\nNelson's campaign issued a statement later saying their lawyer wasn't authorized to object to the ballot's rejection as \"Non-citizens cannot vote in US elections.\"\n\nIn Fort Lauderdale, Gillum appeared at a predominantly African-American church Sunday evening, warning against vote suppression and declaring voter disenfranchisement isn't just about being blocked from the polling booth. He said it also includes absentee ballots not being counted and ballots with mismatched signatures that \"a volunteer may have the option of ... deciding that vote is null and void.\"\n\nGillum and Nelson have argued each vote should be counted and the process should take its course.\n\nBoth the state elections division, which Scott runs, and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement have said they have found no evidence of voter fraud.\n\nThat didn't stop protests outside Snipes' office, where a crowd of mostly Republicans gathered, holding signs, listening to country music and occasionally chanting \"lock her up,\" referring to Snipes. A massive Trump 2020 flag flew over the parking lot and many members of a Bikers For Trump group wore matching shirts, mingling among a crowd that included a protester wearing a Hillary Clinton mask.\n\nRegistered independent Russell Liddick, a 38-year-old Pompano Beach retail worker, carried a sign reading, \"I'm not here for Trump! I'm here for fair elections! Fire Snipes!\" He said the office's problems \"don't make me feel very much like my vote counted.\"\n\nFlorida is also conducting a recount in a third statewide race. Democrat Nikki Fried had a 0.07 percentage point lead over Republican state Rep. Matt Caldwell for agriculture commissioner, one of Florida's three Cabinet seats.\n\nFor some, the recounts bring back memories of the 2000 presidential recount, when it took more than five weeks for Florida to declare George W. Bush the victor over Vice President Al Gore by 537 votes, thus giving Bush the presidency.\n\nMuch has changed since then.\n\nIn 2000, each county had its own voting system. Many used punch cards \u2014 voters poked out chads, leaving tiny holes in their ballots representing their candidates. Some voters, however, didn't fully punch out the presidential chad or gave it just a little push. Those hanging and dimpled chads had to be examined by the canvassing boards, a lengthy, tiresome and often subjective process that became fodder for late-night comedians.\n\nNow the state requires all Florida counties to use ballots where voters use a pen to mark their candidate's name, much like a student taking a multiple-choice test. And how counts proceed is now clearly spelled out.\n\nWATCH: This midterm ballot initiative could swing Florida in 2020", "When Democrats take control of the U.S. House they plan to investigate the Trump administration's decision to try to block AT&T from acquiring Time Warner, and whether officials sought to punish Amazon.com by prodding the U.S. Post Office to hike shipping prices for the world's largest e-commerce company, a senior Democrat said on Sunday.\n\nSpeaking to online publication Axios, Representative Adam Schiff, who is expected to be the incoming chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said Democrats will review if Trump used the powers of the federal government to punish the companies.\n\nRepresentative Elijah Cummings, the likely incoming chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said the committee \"may want to look into\" if the White House retaliated against Amazon and AT&T.\n\nCummings also said on ABCs \"This Week\" that he intends to investigate if Trump killed plans to relocate the new headquarters of the FBI because moving it could harm his business interests in the Trump Hotel across the street.\n\nSince winning control of the House of Representatives in the midterm elections last week, Democrats have vowed to launch investigations on a wide range of topics involving the Trump administration.\n\nAmazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos owns the Washington Post, while Time Warner's holdings include CNN.

Small rockets like Electron can save customers months of time getting to orbit but come at a higher cost compared to flying as a \"rideshare\" on a larger rocket like the SpaceX Falcon 9.\n\n\"It's Business Time\" launched six satellites for Spire, Tyvak, Fleet and the Irvine CubeSat STEM program. The launch also included a spacecraft built by HPS GmbH to demonstrate a new technology to reduce space debris.\n\nThe launch keeps Rocket Lab \u2013 valued at more than $1.2 billion and based in New Zealand and California \u2013 at the front of the pack in the small rocket race. Beck estimates there are over 100 companies trying to catch up. But Rocket Lab has another launch scheduled for December, as well as 16 launches planned for 2019.\n\nRocket Lab has a backlog of launches for the next 18 months, Beck said, which is \"around a $3 billion pipeline.\" The factories in New Zealand and California \"have been specifically designed to produce one rocket a week,\" Beck said. Rocket Lab aims to be launching at a weekly rate in 2020.\n\n\"Next year we're starting off at one a month, trying to move to one every two weeks,\" Beck said.\n\nBeck says the company took the time to look at the motor control issue from spring and fixed it, while continuing to build Rocket Lab's infrastructure. This year the rocket company brought on Adam Spice as chief financial officer from the semiconductor industry, opened a new mass production facility in New Zealand and announced it will build a U.S. launchpad in Virginia.\n\n\"Happy to delay a launch for a few months to solidify and strengthen the company,\" Beck told CNBC.\n\nBeck estimated Rocket Lab will soon be profitable, saying when the company completes \"these couple of launches by the end of this year we'll be cash flow neutral.\"\n\nRocket Lab sees greater-than-expected growth coming to the small satellite industry, as the company's Electron rocket begins to meet demand. Beck believes his side of the industry is set to unlock a flurry of technologies as more and more satellites are launched.\n\n\"The small rocket industry is the enablers to the small spacecraft industry and then in turn the small spacecraft industry are really enablers to a whole lot of new technologies, a whole lot of new services to us down on Earth,\" Beck said.", "Top Democrats stepped up pressure Sunday on Acting U.S. Attorney General Matthew Whitaker to step aside from overseeing a special counsel probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, vowing to order him to testify early next year.\n\nRepresentative Jerrold Nadler, the expected incoming chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said Sunday the committee plans to subpoena Whitaker to testify next year as its first witness. \"He should recuse himself. He has expressed total hostility to the investigation,\" Nadler said on the ABC News show \"This Week.\" \"His appointment is simply part of an attack on the investigation by Robert Mueller.\"\n\nIn a letter to the Justice Department's chief ethics officer, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi and other top Democrats advised Whitaker to recuse himself from overseeing Special Counsel Mueller's probe. \"Allowing a vocal opponent of the investigation to oversee it will severely undermine public confidence in the Justice Departments work on this critically important matter,\" the letter said.\n\nDemocrats have also questioned if Whitaker was properly appointed to the position. \"If he doesn't recuse himself, if he has any involvement whatsoever in this Russia probe, we are going to find out whether he made commitments to the president about the probe, whether he is serving as a back channel to the President or his lawyers about the probe, whether he is doing anything to interfere with the probe,\" said Adam Schiff, presumed chair of the House Intelligence Committee, on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\"", "Sometime in the coming weeks, the Trump Administration will announce final plans for rolling back the Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE, standards considered one of the signature accomplishments of the preceding Obama White House.\n\nThe planned rollback, part of the current administration's overall push for deregulation, has won wide criticism among consumer and environmental groups, as well as Democrats in Washington.\n\nWith the GOP soon to cede control of the House of Representatives, the fuel economy rollback, as well as the Trump administration's trade war, are among the many things likely to come under a Democratic spotlight. But the real question is what, if anything, that party will be able to accomplish when they regain some amount of control in Washington.\n\n\"From a standpoint of the auto industry there are a number of issues that will come under debate,\" said David Cole, director-emeritus of the Center for Automotive Research, in Ann Arbor, Michigan.\n\nFew recent administrations have taken as many steps as Trump's that directly impact automotive manufacturers and suppliers, autoworkers and auto buyers.\n\nOn some matters, such as the tariffs on imported aluminum and steel that will cost Ford alone a billion dollars this year, Cole said, the industry would clearly like to see Democrats find a way to get the Trump administration to back down. The same is true for both the China trade war, as well as the so-called \"232\" tariffs that the Commerce Department is studying and which could impose hefty new duties on virtually all automotive imports \u2014 and likely trigger retaliatory tariffs on American-made vehicles.\n\n\"The 232 tariffs pose a real risk,\" said Michael O'Brien, head of product planning for Hyundai Motor America, and could cause a massive disruption of the global automotive production system, including the assembly plant the Korean automaker operates in Alabama.\n\nOn the other hand, there is strong, though by no means unanimous, support among automakers, for rolling back fuel economy standards. A push to retain the 54.5 mile-per-gallon target for 2025 would likely generate an industry outcry.\n\nOne of those who is considered likely to oppose a rollback is Frank Pallone, a New Jersey Democrat who will, come January, take over as chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Pallone has also been an outspoken critic of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration under Trump.\n\nBut, despite the likelihood that Democrats will speak out, and likely try to counter some of the Trump Administration's moves, there seem to be few expectations that a Democratic House could actually block or even alter the administration's plans and policies.\n\nThere will almost certainly be hearings on the tariffs, as well as on the CAFE rollback, industry observers anticipate. And the close industry ties of senior officials, such as EPA chief Andrew Wheeler, a former coal lobbyist, could come in for sharp criticism.\n\nMost of what the administration has done to the auto industry, however, has involved executive orders and other actions that don't require legislative approval, said Eric Winograd, U.S. economist for AllianceBernstein.\n\n\"Trade policy he can do all on his own, unless there's a treaty reached that Congress has to authorize,\" said Winograd, Things that could require new legislation \"he won't be able to do without congressional approval,\" so, the economist added, \"If the president gets frustrated with congressional obstruction, he may turn even more to trade issues (and) we will see possibly increased trade tension in the months to come.\"\n\nOn the other hand, some are speculating that \"Democrat's taking the House might make trade deals more likely, as prolonged disputes could make an economic downturn more likely and play in the Democrats' favor ahead of 2020,\" said Sameer Samana, global investment and technical strategist for Wells Fargo Investment Institute.\n\nA Democratic House could try to play to popular support for measures that protect consumers on several fronts, including privacy. They are also likely to try to reinstate measures, like one recently rolled back by the White House that aimed at ensuring minority customers have the same access to affordable credit as whites do. But new legislation would face strong opposition, both in the Senate and the White House.\n\nBob Schwartz, an auto analyst who also works with AllianceBernstein echoed the likelihood that the Trump administration may \"pivot more to using executive powers, rather than trying to go through Congress.\"\n\nBut Schwartz quickly added that opponents will likely amp up their attacks, for one thing relying on the courts to block administrative plans. A number of environmental moves have been halted, a judge blocked the Keystone XL pipeline last week. And 19 states, along with the District of Columbia, have already sued the administration to block any change to the CAFE standards.\n\nMeanwhile, Schwartz anticipates that with more Democratic governors and attorneys-general taking power after the election, \"states that are turning more blue\" may push through measures of their own \"where they feel the government is falling down on consumer protection.\" California, for one, has already taken such a step by enacting its own net neutrality bill.\n\nTraditionally, there were clear party lines dividing those seen as pro- and anti-auto industry. But the Trump White House has broken many rules, that one included. Republicans who traditionally served as the bastion of trade have largely fallen in line with a protectionist president, for one thing.\n\nThe auto industry likely won't mind some of the results from Tuesday's election, especially the defeat of Missouri's Senator Claire McCaskill, a Democrat and frequent critic of industry safety practices. It's still unclear what will happen in Florida where a recount appears likely in the race between incumbent Democratic Senator Bill Nelson, another frequent industry critic, and his challenger, Florida Gov. Rick Scott.\n\nMeanwhile, at least four Congressmen with ties to auto dealerships, both Democrat and Republic, won re-election to the House. Also elected for the first time was Haley Stevens, who led the Obama team that bailed out General Motors and Chrysler when they went bankrupt nearly a decade ago.\n\n\"It's simply hard to tell\" what all this will mean for the auto industry said Hyundai's O'Brien. But there's little doubt that the auto industry has a lot at stake over the course of the next two years and will be watching to see how things will shake out in Washington.", "Now might be the best time to get your flu shot.\n\nThere is mounting evidence that vaccine protection diminishes over the course of a single season since getting the flu shot, meaning an individual vaccinated in early September may be more vulnerable than someone vaccinated in late October when flu season hits.\n\nA recent study published in Clinical Infectious Diseases found that an eight-week delay in vaccination might prevent about nine flu cases for every 1000 persons vaccinated during an average season. These findings backup previous research, including a 2017 study by CDC scientists that found vaccine effectiveness for strains of H1N1 declined up to 11 percent each month after administration.\n\n\"We're balancing two things. One is coverage of how many people get the vaccine every year. The CDC recommends everyone over six months of age get the flu vaccine \u2013 it's truly our best weapon to protect against this deadly disease. The other thing we're balancing is when is the best time to get the vaccine,\" said Kunal Rambhia, a University of Michigan graduate student who recently co-authored a paper in Clinical Infectious Diseases titled \"Early Bird Gets the Flu.\" His study summarized 11 studies over the last several years that show evidence for this single-season waning immunity.\n\nOver the past decade, vaccines have become available earlier in the season in efforts to increase coverage, especially as large pharmacy chains started offering them. But because flu season tends to peak in December or later, individuals who got vaccinated during July or August may not be protected the entire season.", "Saudi Arabia plans to reduce oil supply to world markets by 0.5 million barrels per day in December, its energy minister said on Sunday, as the OPEC power faces uncertain prospects in its attempts to persuade other producers to agree a coordinated output cut.\n\nKhalid al-Falih told reporters that Saudi Aramcos customer crude oil nominations would fall by 500,000 bpd in December versus November due to seasonal lower demand. The cut represents a reduction in global oil supply of about 0.5 percent.\n\nSaudi Arabia has increased output by just about 1 million bpd this year under pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump and other consuming countries to help balance the market to compensate for lower supplies from Iran due to U.S. sanctions.\n\nBut since Iran's customers were given generous waivers to continue buying crude, concerns grew about market oversupply and oil prices fell to below $70 per barrel on Friday from $85 a barrel in October.\n\n\"We have been increasing production in response to demand,\" Falih told reporters in Abu Dhabi ahead of a joint OPEC, non-OPEC market monitoring committee meeting.\n\n\"I'll tell you a piece of news which is (that) December nominations are 500,000 barrels less than November. So we are seeing a tapering off part of it is year end, part of it is maintenance.... so we will be shipping less in December than we are in November.\n\nSaudi Arabia is discussing a proposal that could see OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers cut output by up to 1 million bpd, two sources told Reuters earlier on Sunday, as the world's top oil exporter grapples with a drop in crude prices.\n\nThe sources said any such deal would depend on factors including the level of Iranian exports after the United States imposed sanctions on Tehran but granted Iran's top oil buyers waivers to continue buying oil.\n\nRussian participation was key to helping OPEC rebalance the market during 2017-18. But Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Sunday he wasnt certain the market would be oversupplied next year.\n\nHe said the oversupply for the next few months would be seasonally driven while by mid 2019 the market could be balanced again and demand could even exceed supply.\n\nIRAN WAIVERS SURPRISE\n\nRiyadh was surprised by the waivers granted by Washington to Iran's main customers such as China and India, a move which hit oil prices, at least three industry and OPEC sources told Reuters.\n\nNow Saudi Arabia wants to act to prevent a further slide in prices and is leading discussions on cutting oil output next year, the sources said.\n\nUnder a deal set to expire at the end of the year, OPEC and non-OPEC producers agreed to curb output by around 1.8 million bpd.\n\nBut producers ended up cutting more and so agreed in June to limit their reductions by more than their output targets, meaning restoring about 1 million bpd in output.\n\nOPEC and its allies will meet in Vienna on Dec. 6-7 to decide on output policy for 2019.\n\n\"There is a general discussion about this (cut). But the question is how much is needed to be reduced by the market,\" one of the sources said in Abu Dhabi on Sunday.\n\n\"No one expected the waivers. Saudi Arabia wants to at least put a floor under oil prices. No one wants a free fall in prices,\" the source added.\n\nKazakh deputy energy minister Magzum Mirzagaliyev told reporters in Abu Dhabi that he understood Saudi Arabia was suggesting using August-October output levels as a baseline for determining cuts.\n\nFalih did not rule out the possibility of a cut next year, but also said he would like to \"move into 2019 with minimum interventions.\"\n\n\"I think ideally we dont like to cut. Ideally we like to keep the market ... liberally supplied and comfortable. We will only cut if we see a persistent glut emerging and quite frankly we are seeing some signs of this coming out of the US, we have not seen the signs globally,\" he told reporters.\n\nBrent crude on Friday fell 47 cents, or 0.7 percent, to settle at $70.18 a barrel. It lost about 3.6 percent on the week and has shed more than 15 percent this quarter.\n\nWashington gave 180-day waivers to eight Iranian oil buyers - China, India, South Korea, Japan, Italy, Greece, Taiwan and Turkey. This group takes as much as three-quarters of Iran's seaborne oil exports, trade data shows.\n\nThe U.S. administration has vowed to reduce Iranian oil exports to zero and Trump has put pressure on Saudi Arabia to raise output to cool the market.\n\nIran's crude exports could fall to little more than 1 million bpd in November, roughly a third of their mid-2018 peak. But traders and analysts say that figure could rise from December as importers use their waivers.\n\nFalih said last month the kingdom would pump 11 million bpd in November, up from 10.7 million bpd in October.

The jury ruled that Aetna recklessly disregarded its duty to deal fairly and in good faith with Cunningham, who had nasopharyngeal cancer.\n\nAetna is considering whether to appeal the ruling, which was issued this week. Company attorney John Shely said the insurer tries to do the right thing.\n\n\"If it's in our control to change, that's what we're going to do,\" Shely said. \"Aetna has learned something here.\"\n\nAn Aetna doctor denied Cunningham coverage for the therapy in 2014, deeming it experimental. Two other in-house doctors reviewed and upheld the decision.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration had approved proton beam therapy, which is also a treatment covered by Medicare, according to Doug Terry, the family's attorney. He alleged that Aetna denied coverage for financial reasons and that its doctors were unqualified, overworked and biased when making decisions. Court records show that one doctor complained to the insurer about having to review more than 80 cases a day.\n\nAfter she was denied coverage, Cunningham and her husband decided to mortgage their home in Meeker, about 35 miles (56 kilometers) east of Oklahoma City, to pay for the therapy in Texas. She died in May 2015 at age 54.\n\n\"My wife, her goal, was to make this fight,\" Ron Cunningham said. \"Her comment was, 'If we can save one person and stop Aetna from doing what they traditionally do on every claim, it was worth the battle.'\"", "Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong suggested on Sunday a general election may be called next year, more than a year before his government's mandate ends, as the city-state braces for growing economic uncertainty amid global trade tensions.\n\nLee's People's Action Party (PAP) has dominated Singapore's politics over the five decades since the republic's independence, winning all the elections with significant majorities, and faces no real challenge to its power.\n\nBut it has tried to address signs of voter discontent by vowing to ease wealth disparity and improve social mobility, while moving ahead with a leadership transition to pick a successor who will take over from Lee in coming years.\n\n\"This may be the last party conference before the next general election,\" Lee told the PAP convention.\n\n\"The new CEC (Central Executive Committee) will be leading the party into the final stretch, gearing up to put our record before the voters,\" Lee said.\n\nThe annual convention elected a new Central Executive Committee on Sunday bringing into its top ranks young cabinet ministers, dubbed 4G leaders, from whose number Lee's successor will be selected.\n\nSeven senior party members who have led the party and government, including the two current deputy prime ministers, retired from the committee.\n\nSingapore's central bank has warned that an intensifying trade row between China and the United States is likely to hurt its economy, hitting harder as the trade dispute drags on.\n\nLee, the eldest son of Singapore founding leader Lee Kuan Yew, has made clear he was ready to step down in the next couple of years, but no clear successor has been chosen from a group of younger ministers tasked with selecting a leader from their ranks.\n\n\"The PAP must win the next general election convincingly,\" Lee told the convention. \"We take a pragmatic and centrist approach in our politics and in our policies.
