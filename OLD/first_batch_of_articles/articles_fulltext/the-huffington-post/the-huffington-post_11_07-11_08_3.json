Children\u2019s Books About Embracing All Differences", "Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker once argued that an American president had such broad executive power that they could order any federal investigation be stopped without obstructing justice.\n\nIn a 2017 interview on \u201cThe David Webb Show,\u201d first reported by Mother Jones, Whitaker argued that, amid reports Trump had asked former FBI Director James Comey to drop an investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn, there was no case for obstruction of justice regardless of President Donald Trump\u2019s motives because the president is entitled to make such calls with his inherent authority.\n\nThe interview came shortly after Comey was fired by Trump and while Whitaker, then the head of a conservative nonprofit group, was a regular commentator on right-leaning media.\n\n\u201cThere is no case for obstruction of justice because the president has all the power of the executive and delegates that to people like the FBI director and the attorney general,\u201d Whitaker argued. \u201cThe president could, and has in our nation\u2019s history, said stop investigating this person or please investigate this other person.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cThis hyperventilation of what we see here is not sustainable based on these facts.\u201d\n\nWhitaker has already come under fire for deeply critical views of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe that he\u2019d made in the past. In an interview with CNN in 2017, he argued that the inquiry could be kneecapped if the attorney general \u201cjust reduces his budget so low that the investigation grinds almost to a halt.\u201d In a separate editorial for CNN, he wrote that Mueller\u2019s team had already gone too close to a red-line during the scope of the probe.\n\n\u201cIt is time for Rosenstein, who is the acting attorney general for the purposes of this investigation, to order Mueller to limit the scope of his investigation to the four corners of the order appointing him special counsel.\u201d Whitaker wrote. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t, then Mueller\u2019s investigation will eventually start to look like a political fishing expedition.\u201d\n\nSome prominent legal scholars have already lambasted the choice of Whitaker, including George Conway, the husband of White House adviser Kellyanne Conway. In an op-ed for The New York Times on Thursday, George Conway argued that the appointment was unconstitutional and accused the president of seeking to evade requirements that an attorney general be confirmed by the Senate.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s illegal. And it means that anything Mr. Whitaker does, or tries to do, in that position is invalid,\u201d Conway wrote with former acting U.S. Solicitor General Neal K. Katyal.", "Taylor Hill via Getty Images Jeff Sessions was the first senator to endorse Donald Trump's presidential campaign. Once in office, he may have been his most effective Cabinet member.\n\nOn Wednesday, President Donald Trump delivered his first counterpunch to the results of Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections by forcing the resignation of Jeff Sessions, his embattled attorney general. With a new Democrat-controlled House of Representatives that will strengthen the Russia investigations against him, the president\u2019s firing of Sessions \u2015 the departing attorney general\u2019s resignation letter made clear it was the president\u2019s decision \u2015 demonstrates that Trump is preparing for and even stoking, as is his tendency, a vicious battle.\n\nTrump\u2019s relationship with Sessions has often been strained and combative, a surprising development given how much the two men agree on but also revealing of the president\u2019s only real agenda: himself.\n\nSessions was an early endorser of Trump\u2019s presidential ambitions, a key step toward legitimacy for Trump\u2019s candidacy when so many other Republican leaders were hesitant to get behind his campaign. For Trump, the endorsement signaled Sessions\u2019 loyalty \u2015 the characteristic he values in others above all else.\n\nIt didn\u2019t hurt either that Sessions had a long career advancing a far-right political agenda that matches so neatly with Trump\u2019s own policy goals, to the extent that he has any. As senator, Sessions opposed almost all forms of immigration, a hard-line stance that put him out of step with even most Republicans at the time. Earlier in his career, Sessions\u2019 nomination to a federal judgeship had been prevented by the Senate due to allegations of racism during his time as a U.S. attorney in Alabama. That black mark on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 would have kept Sessions out of most Republican presidents\u2019 Cabinets. But it may have actually helped endear Sessions to Trump, who seems to think the real problem of American racism is how the charge of it hurts white Americans.\n\nDespite all this common ground, Sessions lost Trump\u2019s favor shortly after becoming attorney general when he recused himself from overseeing the Russia investigation in early 2017. Sessions\u2019 critics rightly praised his decision as a proper adherence to the law and a hopeful sign he would honor his obligation to the American people. But for Trump, Sessions\u2019 recusal represented a personal betrayal and a violation of what he saw as Sessions\u2019 duty to him.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018What kind of a man is this?\u2019\u201d Trump ranted to Fox News in an interview this year about how Sessions\u2019 recusal had infuriated him. On Twitter, Trump has blasted Sessions as \u201cVERY weak\u201d and \u201cDISGRACEFUL,\u201d while privately mocking him as \u201cMr. Magoo.\u201d All of this pointed toward Sessions\u2019 eventual firing. The only question was when.\n\nThe irony, of course, is that Sessions has pursued and accomplished Trump\u2019s political agenda more effectively than any other Cabinet member. On immigration, Sessions, working with presidential adviser Stephen Miller, set in place the \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy for illegal immigration that led to the forced separation of families at the southern border and has created a tremendous backlog of cases in immigration courts. He has gone after MS-13 with vigor while loosening oversight of law enforcement officials. Sessions has redefined whose civil rights the Justice Department would protect and backed voting rights restrictions.\n\nJIM WATSON via Getty Images Sessions had a long career advancing a far-right political agenda that matches neatly with Trump\u2019s own policy goals, but Sessions lost Trump\u2019s favor shortly after becoming attorney general when he recused himself from overseeing the Russia investigation in early 2017.\n\nFor a presidential administration that can\u2019t point to a lot of political accomplishments, Sessions achieved notable successes for Trumpism. But those don\u2019t matter much to a man whose presidency has always really been less about any coherent policy agenda than it is about the simple pursuit of his own self-interests and, with increasing evidence of a variety of scandals, his self-protection.\n\nAccordingly, that meant Sessions had to go, especially with the incoming Democratic majority able to provide some level of protection for special counsel Robert Mueller and his investigation. In choosing Matthew Whitaker as acting attorney general in Sessions\u2019 place, Trump made clear that the only thing he\u2019s looking for in the position is someone who will work to thwart the Russia investigation.\n\nWhitaker has certainly indicated he is committed to that task. In an op-ed written for CNN in 2017, Whitaker wrote that Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation was \u201cgoing too far.\u201d Whitaker has also voiced his opposition to Mueller\u2019s team possibly investigating the president and his family members\u2019 finances, one of Trump\u2019s biggest concerns. \u201cThe president is absolutely correct,\u201d Whitaker wrote of Trump\u2019s statement that such a move would be a \u201cviolation.\u201d Elsewhere, Whitaker has expressed his support for decreasing Mueller\u2019s budget so much that the investigations can\u2019t continue.\n\nWhitaker\u2019s willingness to be Trump\u2019s defender rather than the law\u2019s is certainly why he has been chosen. It\u2019s also yet another clear sign that Trump knows he\u2019s guilty and needs to assemble the most loyal team around him, especially inside the Justice Department.\n\nAs a man who built his business career and public persona on lies and criminality, Trump\u2019s attention to his ego and his self-protection are one and the same. In so many ways, Sessions showed his loyalty to the president, but in one crucial decision he did not go along with Trump\u2019s plan to place himself above the law. That\u2019s what mattered most to the president.", "Actress Gabrielle Union and NBA star Dwyane Wade have welcomed a baby girl.\n\nThe celebrity couple shared news of the birth of their daughter, who was born via surrogate, on social media Thursday.\n\n\u201cWe are sleepless and delirious but so excited to share that our miracle baby arrived last night via surrogate and 11/7 will forever be etched in our hearts as the most loveliest of all the lovely days,\u201d the couple wrote.\n\n\u201cWelcome to the party sweet girl!\u201d\n\nUnion, 46, and Wade, 36, got married in 2014.

But as with most attempts at computer-generated humanity, the virtual anchor is both impressively realistic and yet unsettlingly soulless. Its limited range of motion and expressions becomes repetitive after a short time, while its gray crisp suit and perfectly coiffed hair are even more rigid than human cable news hosts. The AI anchor\u2019s voice is unmistakably robotic, too, mispronouncing words such as \u201cPanama\u201d and getting the space between words slightly off \u2015 akin to hearing the news from an Alexa virtual assistant or a car\u2019s GPS.\n\nBut Xinhua appears to know that the anchor is a work in progress, as the AI\u2019s sign-off message on its first report emphasized.\n\n\u201cAs an AI news anchor under development, I know there is a lot for me to improve.

Now that she\u2019s 23, that means illustrating the grave array of misogynistic incidents she and other women confront on a daily basis.\n\nThe New York-based illustrator, who earned a BFA in musical theater from Penn State University, was a senior in college when accused sexual harasser Donald Trump was elected president. She posted her first drawing just a few days after the 2016 election: a simple portrait of a young woman with the words \u201cI am a powerful woman\u201d written above her.\n\n\u201cI remember really feeling one with the women of the world the day after Trump won. It felt like we were all in this cloud of intense helplessness; it made me restless and upset,\u201d Provisor told HuffPost.\n\nShe said the response to her post was overwhelmingly positive, which encouraged her to look for more opportunities to channel feminist anger as a means of healing and support. Previously, she has drawn, in her own words, \u201cawesome young girls doing their own things.\u201d\n\nBut most recently, Provisor has invited others to share their stories and process that anger through a project called \u201cCats Calling Back,\u201d hosted on her Instagram account. In these drawings, young women are muscling through a grim obstacle course of catcalls, unwanted touches and inappropriate remarks. The illustrations contrast a whimsical girlishness with the realities of walking through the world as a woman.\n\nThe project is deeply personal for Provisor, who was shocked by the degree of disrespect she felt on the streets of New York when she first arrived in the city. Originally she wrote down all the catcalls she received in just the few blocks she repeatedly traveled near her home, with the intention of creating a larger art project down the line. But the remarks soon became \u201ctoo frequent and soul-crushing\u201d to document daily, and Provisor wanted to do more to reckon with their impact on her emotional wellbeing.\n\n\u201cI realized that I wasn\u2019t having real, honest conversations about how the catcalling affects me and how badly I was internalizing it. I wanted to stop joking about it and actually let the anger affect my work in an honest way,\u201d she said.\n\nShe began sharing comics that illustrate experiences of catcalling and other types of harassment in public places. Her first was a self-portrait with speech bubbles featuring examples from her collected list of catcalls, and the second was a humorous imagining of how she might have reacted to them in real time.\n\nBut it can be dangerous to answer harassment in real time. Her followers were responding to the images as a safe opportunity to process their own experiences. Provisor decided to invite other women to share their stories, which she would illustrate and post to her Instagram page. She called the project \u201cCats Calling Back.\u201d\n\n\u201cShock, society, and obligation often force us to move on so quickly after events like this \u2026 and we deny that trauma its full time to exist,\u201d Provisor said. \u201cWe deny ourselves proper time to heal. We are just forced to accept it, normalize it, and pretend it doesn\u2019t hurt. But many of us don\u2019t want to accept it or normalize it, and we are hurting from it in our emotional, mental, and social lives.\u201d\n\nProvisor mines the submissions she gets for particular sentences or attention-grabbing details that can produce striking images and \u201cget people to think and actually read the story,\u201d she said. She creates an illustration that she hopes will coax followers into reading the darker story behind it.\n\nThe illustrator hopes that \u201cCats Calling Back\u201d will \u201cprovide a space for women to tell their stories and, hopefully, feel validated and held in that process.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to be able to let each person who shares a story with me be relieved of their burden for just a moment. I want them to know that I am handling their story with the compassion and attention it deserves,\u201d she said. \u201cI am thinking about them as I\u2019m illustrating their story. I hear them, I believe them, and I want to be able to share their burden for a moment so they don\u2019t have to do it all on their own.\u201d\n\nProvisor also hopes her work makes more people aware of the \u201ckind of daily horrors\u201d women face.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s not happening to you, it\u2019s hard to understand. And that\u2019s okay,\u201d she added. \u201cI\u2019m hoping these stories can provide education and clarity for the very well-meaning, lovely, smart, open-minded people in this world who just don\u2019t know.\u201d", "The beach isn\u2019t Hogwarts, but it\u2019s still magical for a pair of \u201cHarry Potter\u201d alums.\n\nEmma Watson and Tom Felton frolicked by the shore in images Watson posted Thursday.\n\nImagine: Hermione Granger and her nemesis Draco Malfoy chillin\u2019 like Southern California kids with not a care in the world.\n\n\ud83c\udf34\ud83e\udd21 Tom\u2019s @OriginSeries is out on 14th November.

He used to do tricks on it ... He was so cool.\u201d", "President Donald Trump followed through Friday on his legally questionable plan to deny asylum to undocumented immigrants who cross the border illegally.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not letting them in, but they\u2019re trying to flood our country,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nThe move was quickly met with a legal challenge by the American Civil Liberties Union, Southern Poverty Law Center and other immigrant rights groups aiming to block it from going into effect. The groups contend in a lawsuit filed Friday that the policy would violate U.S. and international law that protects people who fear for their lives and safety in their native countries.\n\nBut Trump, frustrated with a slowly approaching migrant caravan, a record number of families apprehended at the southern border and a yearslong swell of asylum-seekers, went ahead with the policy anyway.\n\nThrough a new interim rule and a presidential proclamation, the administration plans to deny asylum for immigrants who request it after crossing the border illegally rather than at a port of entry \u2015 regardless whether they have an otherwise meritorious claim. The change is set to take effect Saturday and will continue for at least 90 days. It applies to unaccompanied minors, although a Trump administration official initially told reporters on Friday that it would not.\n\nAsylum-seekers may still request protections legally at ports of entry, but many of them already face weeks-long waits that leave them in Mexico because U.S. border and asylum officers say they have no capacity to process them. The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that it \u201cis surging additional resources to support our ports of entry,\u201d but emphasized that border officers have other missions as well, possibly putting asylum processing lower on the priority list.\n\nThe Trump administration has made clear that its preference would be for asylum-seekers not to come to U.S. ports of entry. An official told reporters Friday that Central Americans should seek asylum in Mexico instead.\n\nThe proclamation Trump signed says the suspension of entry would either end in 90 days, or when Mexico signs a \u201csafe third country\u201d agreement that bars Central Americans from asylum in the U.S. if they cross through Mexico. Mexico has resisted such an agreement, and human rights advocates argue the country isn\u2019t secure enough to qualify as a \u201csafe third country\u201d anyway.\n\nU.S. law states that immigrants physically present in the country may apply for asylum \u201cwhether or not at a designated port of arrival,\u201d with limited exceptions. Immigrant rights groups have argued that barring asylum for people who crossed illegally would be a blatant overreach.\n\nThe ACLU and other groups filed a lawsuit Friday afternoon in U.S. District Court in California\u2019s Northern District, arguing the policy should be blocked from going into effect.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s new asylum ban is illegal,\u201d Omar Jadwat, director of the ACLU\u2019s Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project, said in a statement. \u201cNeither the president nor his cabinet secretaries can override the clear commands of U.S. law, but that\u2019s exactly what they\u2019re trying to do.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security and Department of Justice issued a statement later Friday saying they were confident they would prevail in court and accused the human rights groups of being disdainful of the law.\n\n\u201cThe fact that the ACLU and its partners would go to court to specifically sue for the right for aliens to enter the country illegally is demonstrative of the open border community\u2019s disdain for our nation\u2019s laws that almost all rational Americans find appalling,\u201d DHS spokeswoman Katie Waldman said in the statement.\n\nMandel Ngan via Getty Images Post-midterm elections, President Donald Trump is doing the same thing he did before them: cracking down on undocumented immigrants.\n\nHowever, Trump administration officials argued on a call with reporters that the asylum policy change is justified on similar grounds to the president\u2019s travel bans, the final of which was allowed to go into effect by the Supreme Court. By law, the president can suspend the entry of a class of immigrants by proclamation if he finds their entry \u201cwould be detrimental to the interests of the United States.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur asylum system is overwhelmed with too many meritless asylum claims from aliens who place a tremendous burden on our resources, preventing us from being able to expeditiously grant asylum to those who truly deserve it,\u201d DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker said in a statement. \u201cToday, we are using the authority granted to us by Congress to bar aliens who violate a Presidential suspension of entry or other restriction from asylum eligibility.\u201d\n\nEven if the policy change is blocked in lower courts, the Trump administration believes the Supreme Court will eventually rule in its favor thanks to Trump\u2019s successful nomination of Justice Brett Kavanaugh, NBC News reported based on conversations with two officials.\n\nUnder the new policy, migrants denied asylum for crossing the border illegally could potentially avoid deportation by being granted \u201cwithholding of removal,\u201d a status that does not include a path to citizenship and can be revoked, or could be given protections under the United Nations Convention Against Torture. They would be assessed using the \u201creasonable fear\u201d standard, which is a higher bar to clear than the one for asylum. Administration officials said the policy would meet the United States\u2019 international obligations since it would allow migrants to avoid removal through \u201cwithholding of removal\u201d and the Convention Against Torture.\n\nThe Trump administration has already made it harder to seek asylum in the U.S. Then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions \u2015 whom Trump ousted on Wednesday \u2015 instructed immigration judges in June to \u201cgenerally\u201d deny asylum based on an individual experiencing gang or domestic violence. That, in turn, led to an uptick in asylum officers rejecting applications, according to immigration attorneys near the border.\n\nAsylum approval rates in immigration court in the 2018 fiscal year were at their lowest in two decades, BuzzFeed reported last week.\n\nMeanwhile, immigrant rights advocates say the administration is increasingly using what it calls \u201cmetering\u201d to restrict the number of people who can seek asylum at ports of entry each day \u2015 now the only place where migrants can request the reprieve. Already, many people must wait weeks or months to even get an appointment, leaving them in Mexico where shelters are struggling to house them and they can be targeted by gangs. This leads to some asylum-seekers choosing to cross illegally and request help afterward instead.\n\nThe DHS Office of Inspector General acknowledged as much in a report in September, in which it wrote that metering \u201cmay have unintended consequences.\u201d\n\n\u201cOIG saw evidence that limiting the volume of asylum-seekers entering at ports of entry leads some aliens who would otherwise seek legal entry into the United States to cross the border illegally,\u201d the report says.\n\nSeeking asylum is not a crime, and people are entitled to seek asylum regardless of where they cross the border. Eleanor Acer of Human Rights First\n\nEleanor Acer of the nonprofit Human Rights First said the administration \u201chas systematically undermined the asylum and refugee protection systems.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt has illegally turned away refugees at official border points, forcing desperate individuals to make the dangerous crossing between points,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cSeeking asylum is not a crime, and people are entitled to seek asylum regardless of where they cross the border.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration has balked at its inability to quickly deport or indefinitely detain asylum-seekers, families and children, based on space constraints and court-based limitations on how long kids can be locked up.\n\nDHS released a statement on Thursday accusing migrants of being coached by smugglers and advocates to use the \u201cmagic words\u201d to be considered for asylum. Nearly 90 percent of migrants from Central America passed the first step of screening for asylum, but only 9 percent were ultimately granted the protections, according to DHS.\n\nTrump has taken other dramatic steps in recent weeks that he claims are justified by migrant caravans still hundreds of miles from the border. Trump sent more than 5,000 troops to the border to assist Customs and Border Protection, although the military is not authorized to make immigration-related arrests. Before the election, the military decision was called Operation Faithful Patriot; the Pentagon dropped the name without explanation the day after the midterms. (Defense Secretary Jim Mattis insisted the deployment was not a stunt.)\n\nThere could be other actions against undocumented immigrants and their families to come, even though Democratic gains in the House will make passing the president\u2019s agenda through Congress more difficult beginning next year. Trump said before the midterm elections that he would sign an executive order to end birthright citizenship. Under the 14th Amendment, babies born in the U.S. are citizens regardless of the immigration status of their parents, but Trump wants to take that away \u2015 another action ripe for a legal challenge.\n\n\u201cWe do not expect any one action to solve all of the myriad, legion of flaws in our nation\u2019s current immigration system,\u201d a senior administration official said. \u201cWe are looking at a number of possibilities.\u201d", "A prominent Missouri activist who found her son hanging in her backyard is angry that authorities are looking at the possibility he killed himself.

Perpetrators historically rarely faced more than a fine, experts say, but can now be sentenced to up to five years in prison thanks to a law that took effect in September.\n\nThe Sexual Harassment Law was passed earlier this year amid an uproar over the arrest and swift release of a man who ejaculated on a fellow bus passenger.

I was already leaving the subway, on the escalator, and was distracted answering texts when I felt something cold on my back,\u201d she said. \u201cI ran my hand over it and smelled something terrible. When I took the backpack off, I saw the condom.\u201d\n\nBarboza went to a bathroom to wash her clothes and said another woman noticed she was visibly shaken. The woman brought Barboza to transit authority staff, who advised her to file a police report at a station inside the terminal.\n\nAuthorities there refused to label the offense as sexual harassment, Barboza said, and instead classified it as a misdemeanor \u201cinsult to decency.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom the time I arrived, I said it was sexual harassment, and the official said it was not,\u201d she said. \u201cI asked why, and he said there was no physical contact.\u201d\n\nI think putting a used condom in someone\u2019s purse, against her will, without her consent, characterizes sexual harassment. ...

Ana Paula Braga, a lawyer with the Feminist Network of Jurists\n\nAna Paula Braga, a lawyer with the Feminist Network of Jurists, said she thought both cases could meet the requirements of harassment under the new law, since condoms have a clear sexual purpose.\n\n\u201cI think putting a used condom in someone\u2019s purse, against her will, without her consent, characterizes sexual harassment,\u201d Braga said. \u201cWhat jurists have been discussing is how the courts will judge this lewd act in practice.

But he can keep chugging along with one of his legacy-defining efforts: confirming conservative judges in the Senate.\n\nSenate Republicans are in a good position to pick up as many as three seats once all the midterm election votes have been counted. That will make it even easier for Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to put Trump\u2019s nominees into lifetime federal court seats.\n\nMcConnell has already been confirming judges at a breakneck pace, but given the GOP\u2019s slim majority in the Senate, he couldn\u2019t really afford to lose a single Republican on those votes. Now he\u2019ll have more wiggle room if a GOP senator or two wants to vote no.\n\nMcConnell has said all along that judicial confirmations are his No. 1 priority as Senate leader. That won\u2019t change going forward.\n\n\u201cWe intend to keep confirming as many as we possibly can for as long as we\u2019re in a position to do it,\u201d he told reporters on Wednesday. \u201cIt will still be my top priority in setting the agenda here in the Senate. In the next Congress as well.\u201d\n\nTo date, the Republican leader has confirmed two Supreme Court justices, 29 circuit judges and 53 district judges. He\u2019s confirmed so many circuit judges \u2015 many of whom are strongly anti-abortion, anti-LGBTQ rights and anti-voting rights, and nearly all of whom are ideologues handpicked by the conservative Federalist Society \u2015 that 1 in 7 seats on the U.S. circuit courts are now filled by judges nominated by Trump.\n\nThere\u2019s not much Democrats can do over the next two years to prevent Trump from drastically reshaping the courts. Republicans have been blowing up Senate rules and traditions to get as many judges through as possible, weakening the few tools the minority has to put a check on unqualified or egregiously ideological judicial nominees. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) has also made it easier for Republicans: He cut deals two times this year with McConnell to expedite votes on batches of lifetime federal judges in exchange for letting Democrats go home to campaign for re-election.\n\nA Schumer spokesman did not respond to a question on whether the Democratic leader is willing to cut more deals to expedite votes on judges in exchange for something else.\n\nBut a senior Senate Democratic aide, who requested anonymity, defended Schumer\u2019s last such deal. He argued that it minimized the total number of judges who might have been confirmed before the midterm elections because McConnell could have kept senators in town and teed up votes on even more nominees than the agreed-on 15.\n\n\u201cIf we had stayed in session, McConnell could\u2019ve confirmed more than the deal yielded,\u201d said this aide.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS The nation's federal courts are going to look a lot different by the time these two are done with them.\n\nThe reality is that the GOP\u2019s strengthened hand in the Senate won\u2019t change much when it comes to lower court nominees. Republicans already vote in lockstep to confirm all of them \u2015 including the two pro-abortion rights GOP senators, Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) and Susan Collins (Maine), who have voted for piles of anti-abortion judges. To date, only one Republican senator, John Kennedy (La.), has voted against one of Trump\u2019s circuit judges.\n\nBut if another Supreme Court seat opens up in the next two years, McConnell\u2019s increased majority means Trump could nominate someone even further to the right and have a better chance of getting that person through.\n\nCarl Tobias, a University of Richmond law professor and expert on judicial nominations, said his hope is that Republicans will return to \u201creal regular order\u201d in the next Senate session. That would mean restoring bipartisan traditions like considering American Bar Association evaluations of judicial nominees before giving them hearings, allowing for meaningful consultations with Democrats on nominees from their states, and honoring \u201cblue slips,\u201d which give senators veto power over nominees from their states.\n\nHe\u2019s not holding his breath.\n\n\u201cMy hope is some GOP institutionalists will speak out, but it is difficult to see who that might be,\u201d said Tobias. \u201cOne possibility is more nominees who are not qualified and the issues that can create, but shame and embarrassment don\u2019t seem to matter.\u201d", "You likely won\u2019t be hearing comedian Hasan Minhaj say President Donald Trump\u2019s real name on his new Netflix show, \u201cPatriot Act\u201d \u2015 something he said Harry Potter fans would be familiar with.\n\n\u201cYou know how there\u2019s characters in the Harry Potter books, and a lot of them don\u2019t mention Lord Voldemort?\u201d Minhaj said earlier this week during an appearance on \u201cThe Late Show with Stephen Colbert.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor me, he\u2019s the man who shall not be named,\u201d he said of Trump. \u201cI know he exists, but I just don\u2019t want to give him the attention.\u201d\n\nHe joked that he instead refers to the president as \u201cDJ T\u201d or \u201c45.\u201d", "Three years and one giant back tattoo later, Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner are no longer separated, but officially divorced.\n\nThe former couple\u2019s divorce was finalized on Wednesday less than week after they submitted paperwork to the Los Angeles County Superior Court judge overseeing their case, according to TMZ.\n\nGarner and Affleck will share joint custody of their three children, Violet, 12, Seraphina, 9, and Samuel, 6, and will regularly meet with a co-parenting therapist for at least six months. The two, who didn\u2019t have a prenup, have already reached a property settlement.\n\nThe pair reportedly finalized the details of their divorce during a sit-down meeting in October but were awaiting the final sign-off from a judge.\n\nGarner and Affleck, who began dating shortly after starring in 2003\u2032s \u201cDaredevil\u201d together, announced they were separating after 10 years of marriage in 2015 amid rumors of his infidelity.\n\nThe proceedings seemingly stalled for two years, as they didn\u2019t file for divorce until April 2017. After both parties failed to submit any subsequent paperwork, the divorce was on the verge of being dismissed in August when Garner was issued a third notice of a case review requesting she take immediate action.\n\nGarner and Affleck reportedly reached a divorce settlement shortly after the court\u2019s warning but delayed finalizing the paperwork to wait for Affleck to complete his third stint in rehab.\n\nGarner was actually the one to drive Affleck to a treatment center for alcohol addiction in August.\n\nTwo months later, the Academy Award-winning director broke his silence about rehab, announcing he had completed a 40-day program and was \u201cfighting for my family.\u201d\n\nGarner, who\u2019s stood by Affleck throughout his struggles, opened up about the toll the relentless tabloid scrutiny had on their marriage.\n\n\u201cLooking back on that, I really feel the stress of it,\u201d Garner said on \u201cCBS Sunday Morning.\u201d \u201cI really \u2014 I could cry talking about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat I think I\u2019ve learned is that the scrutiny in your private life puts a pressure to make something happen,\u201d she explained. \u201cYou feel a pressure to hurry up and get married, cuz you think that\u2019ll end the \u2014 \u2018Are they engaged?

The two argued and talked over each other until Acosta\u2019s microphone was taken away.", "Florida voters made history on Tuesday, amending their state constitution to automatically restore voting rights to people with felony convictions once they complete their sentences. But there still could be hurdles facing the newly enfranchised Floridians, of whom there may be up to 1.4 million.\n\nThe measure, known as Amendment 4, erases a state policy of permanent disenfranchisement rooted in the Jim Crow South that blocked more than 1 in 5 African-Americans in the state from voting. The amendment, which goes into effect Jan. 8, makes it clear that people with felony convictions \u2015 except those convicted of murder and sexual offenses \u2015 can vote once they complete their sentences, including probation and parole. Estimates show those newly enfranchised voters, 10 percent of the state\u2019s voting population, could make a difference politically \u2015 but it\u2019s unlikely there will be a new wave of voters casting ballots immediately.\n\nSince 2007, of the people in Florida with felony convictions who went to prison and then went through the state\u2019s cumbersome process to get their voting rights restored, only 14 percent have registered to vote, according to an estimate from the Brennan Center for Justice. In Florida\u2019s August primary, turnout among formerly incarcerated people who had their voting rights restored was three-quarters of the statewide average, the Brennan Center found. (The estimate does not include people convicted of a felony who are sentenced to parole or probation.)\n\nKirk Bailey, political director at the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida, which backed Amendment 4, said the measure is \u201cself-executing,\u201d meaning Florida lawmakers will not have a say in how the amendment is implemented.\n\nStill, the state could make it difficult for people to regain their voting rights. Once Amendment 4 goes into effect, it\u2019s unclear whether the state will only allow people to vote once they entirely repay the fines and fees associated with their sentences, which can quickly add up to hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s been sort of the big secret of the criminal justice system \u2015 people are on probation or parole, [and] one of the conditions [of completion] is pay your fines and fees,\u201d said Marc Mauer, executive director of the Sentencing Project, a criminal justice nonprofit organization. \u201cThese are indigent people and the fines and fees are quite excessive, so it doesn\u2019t get paid. Typically, if you abide by the other conditions of probation, then they just ignore the fines and fees.\u201d\n\nIn February, Mauer co-authored a memo noting that 40 percent of the people waiting to have their voting rights restored in Florida had outstanding fines and fees. If that percentage is the same in 2018, Mauer estimated that the number of people eligible to get their voting rights back would drop from 1.4 million to about 840,000.\n\nThirty states require people with felony convictions to repay all their fines and fees before they can regain the right to vote, according to a 2016 report by the Alliance for a Just Society. Nine states explicitly require repayment of these obligations in order to vote, while the remaining 21 say repayment is a condition of completing a sentence, which in turn is a condition of getting to vote again. AJS\u2019 report says that to make voting rights contingent on repaying these fees is a \u201cmodern poll tax.\u201d\n\nThe state will also have to figure out a way for law enforcement and correction officials to share information with election officials to determine which people have fully completed their sentences and are eligible to vote.\n\nEven without formal obstacles from the state, organizers still face the challenge of educating people about their new eligibility.\n\nPeople with a felony conviction who are now eligible to vote might still be hesitant to vote out of fear they could be doing something illegal, said Rob Scott, executive director of the Cornell Prison Education Program in New York.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s all kind of pet theories about what you can and can\u2019t do, in my experience, among people who are incarcerated or formerly incarcerated,\u201d Scott said. \u201cThose are taken very seriously, because a lot of times they have to do with perceived risk of re-arrest, which is like the last thing you want.\u201d\n\nFloridians affected by Amendment 4 also face many of the same barriers faced by voters everywhere. Those can include \u201clack of transportation, hourly wage jobs that make taking time off to vote difficult, candidates that don\u2019t represent their interests, and a lack of familiarity with the process,\u201d as Kevin Morris, a researcher at the Brennan Center, wrote in a blog post this week.\n\nNeil Volz, political director for the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition, the group that backed Amendment 4, said his organization would emphasize personal stories of people with felony convictions who were voting to convince others to do the same.\n\n\u201cIf somebody can say \u2018I\u2019m a returning citizen, I\u2019m registering to vote, I need you guys to go register to vote,\u2019 that\u2019s a powerful tool,\u201d Volz said. \u201cLead by example.\u201d\n\nMauer said he thinks the particular life experiences of the people affected by Amendment 4 could motivate them to turn out to vote.", "Since becoming the chief steward of America\u2019s natural resources in March 2017, Zinke has been the focus of a steady drumbeat of federal investigations \u2015 one of which was recently referred to the Department of Justice. Environmental groups have likened him to former Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt, who resigned from his post in July amid a frenzy of ethical scandals.\n\nAfter their victory Tuesday, House Democrats will gain powerful subpoena authority starting Jan. 3 \u2015 and they plan to use it.\n\nZinke is a \u201ctarget-rich environment\u201d and there is \u201cno question\u201d Democrats will be looking into not only his conduct, but policy changes made at Interior under his watch, Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.), the vice ranking member of the House oversight committee, told HuffPost by phone.\n\n\u201cMr. Zinke is definitely going to be a subject of great interest,\u201d Connolly said. \u201cI think everything is potentially on the table.\u201d\n\nChip Somodevilla via Getty Images Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.) is a member of the House oversight committee.\n\nConnolly\u2019s Democratic colleague Raul Grijalva (Ariz.), one of Zinke\u2019s most vocal critics in Congress and likely the next chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, promised even before the midterms that if he\u2019s given the gavel, he will call the interior secretary in to testify about his many \u201cfailures and scandals.\u201d\n\nIn a series of posts on Medium, Democrats on the Natural Resources Committee accused their Republican colleagues of failing to conduct oversight on \u201cthe most ethically challenged member of the Trump administration.\u201d And days before the election, they launched a new Medium series called \u201cWatchdog,\u201d which documents Zinke\u2019s numerous ethical lapses.\n\nA priority of both Grijalva and Connolly will be getting to the bottom of what Connolly called an \u201cabortive attempt\u201d to replace the head of Interior\u2019s office of inspector general with a Trump political appointee from the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The OIG has several ongoing investigations into Zinke\u2019s conduct.\n\nThe Hill first reported the shake-up in October, citing an internal email in which HUD Secretary Ben Carson announced Suzanne Israel Tufts\u2019 departure. Two days later, Interior Department spokeswoman Heather Swift denied the story, saying the media had jumped to conclusions.\n\nCarson\u2019s announcement came shortly after the Interior Department\u2019s watchdog referred one of its investigations to the DOJ, according to The Hill. That investigation was most likely one looking into Zinke\u2019s ties to a Montana real estate development that\u2019s backed by the chairman of oil giant Halliburton.\n\nTufts subsequently resigned as HUD\u2019s assistant secretary.\n\nAlong with looking into whether Zinke has used his office for personal gain, Grijalva and Connolly plan to investigate policy decisions he and his team have made, including drastically shrinking a pair of protected national monuments in Utah. In December, on Zinke\u2019s recommendation, Trump cut the 1.87 million-acre Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, the largest land national monument in the country, roughly in half. The nearby 1.35 million-acre Bears Ears National Monument was slashed by 85 percent. The moves opened the door for oil, gas and other development.\n\nJoshua Roberts / Reuters Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has faced at least 17 federal investigations, many of which are ongoing.\n\nConnolly is among many lawmakers and legal experts who argue U.S. presidents don\u2019t have the authority to abolish, shrink or otherwise weaken national monuments.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s a live issue,\u201d Connolly said of rolling back monument protections. \u201cNot only looking retrospectively at what they did and questioning its legality, but prospectively. If they can do that unchallenged, that has real implications for every Antiquities Act set-aside since Teddy Roosevelt.\u201d\n\nSeventeen presidents, including Trump, have used the 1906 law to designate more than 150 monuments.\n\nOther potential oversight priorities will be Interior\u2019s sweeping proposal to open up nearly all U.S. waters to oil and gas development, Zinke\u2019s proposed reorganization of the agency, and its decision to block two tribes\u2019 application to open a casino in Connecticut. The casino rejection and Zinke\u2019s influence over the shrinking of Grand Staircase-Escalante are the subject of ongoing probes by Interior\u2019s inspector general.\n\nConnolly said that following a \u201ccomplete desert of oversight under the Republican watch\u201d over the last two years, there\u2019s a big appetite for looking into major rollbacks and policy changes, be they at Interior, the EPA or elsewhere. Since Trump took office, Republicans on the House oversight committee have denied more than 60 subpoena requests from Democratic members. On that list is a request for documents Interior withheld about Zinke\u2019s reassignment of career employees.\n\nRep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), the incoming chair of the House oversight committee, said in a statement Wednesday that he plans to \u201cshine a light on waste, fraud, and abuse in the Trump Administration.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to probe senior Administration officials across the government who have abused their positions of power and wasted taxpayer money,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Democrats owe the considerable investigatory powers they will now look to wield against the Trump administration in part to actions taken by their political opponents. In 2015, Republicans changed rules to give numerous committee chairs the power to unilaterally issue subpoenas to force witness testimony and obtain documents. Until then, the head of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee was the only committee chair with such power.\n\nIn a February 2015 letter, Grijalva and 15 other Democrats warned that the rule changes were \u201can invitation to abuse.\u201d But Grijalva thinks the interior secretary\u2019s actions warrant serious inquiry, telling Outside Magazine and other outlets recently that he will use that subpoena power, if necessary, to obtain needed information.\n\nIt remains to be seen if Zinke keeps his job as interior chief. Politico reported last month that he is among several Cabinet members likely to leave after the midterm elections. On Wednesday, Trump told reporters that Zinke is \u201cdoing an excellent job,\u201d but that he would \u201ctake a look\u201d at the allegations against him and likely make a decision about his future next week.\n\nInterior did not respond to HuffPost\u2019s Wednesday request for comment on Democrats\u2019 plans to put Zinke under a microscope. But agency spokeswoman Heather Swift told Politico in September that the secretary won\u2019t be intimidated.", "Darren Hauck via Getty Images Scott Walker's days as the union-busting governor of Wisconsin may be over, but the effects of his efforts will linger.\n\nLabor unions are celebrating the downfall of two of their worst enemies this week: Govs. Scott Walker of Wisconsin and Bruce Rauner of Illinois.

After all, unions may have won this week\u2019s big game, but only after Walker and Rauner forever changed the rules by which the game is played.\n\nLong after Walker leaves the governor\u2019s mansion, Wisconsin\u2019s politics will be shaped by Act 10. That\u2019s the 2011 law Walker pushed through the GOP-controlled legislature that stripped collective-bargaining rights from most government employees. The law has severely reduced public-sector union membership, weakening the state\u2019s labor movement and, by extension, progressive political causes in the state.\n\nAfter kneecapping public-sector unions, Walker and his Republican allies had an easy time enacting a right-to-work law for the Wisconsin private sector just four years later. Such laws bar contracts between unions and employers that require all the workers in a particular bargaining unit to help cover the costs of representation. The laws can lead to what unions derisively call \u201cfree riding\u201d: workers avoiding such representation costs while enjoying the benefits of a union-negotiated contract.\n\nWalker\u2019s successful battles to degrade organized labor made him a darling of the conservative movement and inspired other Republican governors to take a hard line on unions.\n\nA key piece of Rauner\u2019s legacy will be the Supreme Court case Janus v AFSCME. In that monumental 5-4 decision, issued in June, the justices ruled that public-sector workers cannot be required to pay fees to the unions that represent them, deeming such \u201cfair share\u201d fees to be compelled speech.\n\nThe ruling applied right-to-work to the entire U.S. public sector, giving government workers the chance to opt out of paying fees to unions that nonetheless must bargain on their behalf.\n\nRauner originally brought that case as governor, though a judge later ruled he did not have standing since he was not represented by a union. In stepped Mark Janus, the Illinois health department employee represented by AFSCME who ultimately won the case.\n\nThe Janus decision has already cost public-sector unions thousands of previously dues-paying members. It has also forced them to divert time and money to organize the workers they already represent, rather than putting all their resources into organizing new workplaces. It is arguably the worst Supreme Court ruling for unions in decades.\n\nGetty Editorial Ilinois Gov. Bruce Rauner lent his support to a case that eventually resulted in a U.S. Supreme Court undercutting unions nationwide.\n\nAct 10 and Janus are not temporary setbacks for unions. They structurally weaken them by making it harder to retain members. And by doing so the laws politically benefit Republicans, who loathe the influence of unions and the ground game they lend to Democrats in elections.\n\nWhen Donald Trump won Wisconsin in the 2016 election \u2015 one of the critical states that ultimately delivered him the presidency \u2015 the anti-union and anti-tax activist Grover Norquist drew a direct line back to Act 10. He attributed Trump\u2019s win in Wisconsin to unions\u2019 diminished capacity in the state.\n\nAs for the political effects of right-to-work, a recent study by the National Bureau of Economic Research showed that such laws can drive down the share of Democratic votes in a presidential election by 3.5 percent.\n\nThe good news for Wisconsin unions is that the state will now be under divided government. Republicans are retaining control of both chambers of the statehouse, but the new governor \u2015 union ally Tony Evers \u2015 will wield veto power.\n\nBut there is no undoing Act 10 or the right-to-work law, at least anytime soon, said Paul Secunda, a labor law professor at Marquette University Law School in Milwaukee.\n\n\u201cObviously, if the legislature is Republican and the governor is Democratic, it puts a full stop on any further type of anti-worker legislation,\u201d Secunda said. \u201cBut at the same time, it doesn\u2019t put things back to where they were.\u201d\n\nUnion membership in the U.S. has been trending downward for decades. When the Labor Department first started tracking membership in the early 1980\u2032s, more than 20 percent of U.S. workers belonged to unions. As of last year, that rate was down to 10.7 percent.\n\nThe drop in Wisconsin has been precipitous under Walker, from more than 14 percent in 2010 (the year he was first elected) to around eight percent in 2015, where it has hovered since.", "On Tuesday night, lawyers filed a lawsuit on behalf of seven immigrant youth and their families who claim the Trump administration is detaining children for an egregious amount of time.\n\nMost of the young plaintiffs, who range from ages 11 to 17, have been stuck in children\u2019s shelters or foster care facilities for between four and six months, despite having family members who have applied to be their sponsors.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that thousands of children across the U.S. are languishing in detention for months because of a government crackdown on sponsor vetting. Since June, the Trump administration has required every parent and legal guardian who applies to be a sponsor, as well as members of their household, to be fingerprinted, which has caused processing times to increase from five days to over a month in many cases.\n\nAs a result, kids are spending a record amount of time in detention, which the lawsuit says violates immigrant child welfare policies and has caused the children to become anxious, depressed and suicidal.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way to minimize how destructive it is for a child to stay detained in these indefinite situations,\u201d said Neha Desai, the director of immigration at the National Center for Youth Law and one of the lawyers representing the plaintiffs. \u201cThat level of uncertainty is really too much to bear.\u201d\n\nThe Office of Refugee Resettlement did not respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment.\n\nAdministration for Children and Families, Department of Heath and Human Services via Reuters Nearly 1,500 boys ages 10 to 17 are housed in Casa Padre, an immigrant shelter for minors in Brownsville, Texas.\n\nTwo 11- and 16-year-old brothers identified in the lawsuit by their initials, O.S.O. and E.S.O, have been detained in a New York facility for almost four months. Their mother and sponsor, Blanca Ortiz, had her fingerprints taken on July 24, yet according to the children\u2019s caseworker, they still have not been processed.\n\nThe lawsuit describes how the boys are struggling mentally: In mid-October, Ortiz\u2019s 11-year-old told her through tears that he was touched inappropriately by an older child; her 16-year-old, who has learning disabilities, is not receiving special education. Ortiz is so worried about her sons that she can\u2019t sleep at night, according to the filing.\n\n\u201cShe is petrified for their safety,\u201d said Paige Austin, a staff attorney at the New York Civil Liberties Union who is working on the case. \u201cShe has to visit [her sons] and leave at the end of the visits. They don\u2019t understand why.\u201d\n\nNorma Duchitanga\u2019s 17-year-old daughter, another plaintiff in the lawsuit, has been detained at a children\u2019s shelter in Brownsville, Texas, since Oct. 2. The daughter\u2019s caseworker told Duchitanga, who lives in New York, that getting a fingerprint appointment could take up to two months. The desperate mother drove to Philadelphia where the wait time was shorter, but her fingerprints have still not been processed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m worried because how can I know that my child is okay? It\u2019s been too long,\u201d said the mother in a statement to her lawyers. \u201cI feel powerless that I\u2019m not able to do more for my daughter, but I\u2019ve done everything possible to cooperate with the case worker.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s just so painful to witness such preventable trauma that our government is imposing on these kids. We are unnecessarily creating these traumatic situations that will have a lifetime of implications. Neha Desai, National Center for Youth Law\n\nThe lawsuit also says that as a result of fingerprinting delays, children are being held for lengthy stays in unlicensed facilities that don\u2019t meet basic child welfare standards. Since June, immigration officials have been transferring immigrant children to a temporary tent city in Tornillo, Texas, where more than 600 of the 1500 kids are waiting for their sponsors\u2019 fingerprints to be processed.\n\nThe government said the facility, which is in the middle of the desert and made up of tents that hold 20 children, would house teenagers who were close to being released. But according to the Department of Health and Human Services, the average stay is 59 days. And lawyers who recently visited the site told HuffPost they spoke with children whose detention times ranged from a month to five months \u2015 a worrisome fact, given that kids sleep in cramped quarters and have limited access to education and social services.\n\nTwo weeks ago, Desai spoke with a 17-year-old girl who had been detained at Tornillo for two months after having already spent three months in Homestead, another temporary children\u2019s shelter in Florida. Desai says the teen cried while telling her story: Despite having a sponsor who was fingerprinted back in August, immigration officials put her on a plane in early September without telling her she was going to Tornillo.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just so painful to witness such preventable trauma that our government is imposing on these kids,\u201d said Desai. \u201cWe are unnecessarily creating these traumatic situations that will have a lifetime of implications.\u201d\n\nHHS claims that fingerprinting all sponsors will help keep children safe from traffickers. But immigration experts say there were already adequate measures in place to catch criminal sponsors and that the added vetting causes children psychological distress and keeps them out of safe homes.\n\nAustin says that in addition to becoming depressed and suicidal, children languishing in detention for months have begun to distrust the family members who applied to be their sponsors.", "Gisele B\u00fcndchen is one of the world\u2019s highest-paid supermodels.

It\u2019s illegal. And it means that anything Mr. Whitaker does, or tries to do, in that position is invalid,\u201d said Conway, a lawyer, in a piece co-written by former acting U.S. Solicitor General Neal K. Katyal.\n\nThe New York Times The op-ed written by Neal K. Katyal and George Conway.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump announced Whitaker as his pick to replace Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who resigned earlier that day at the president\u2019s request. Whitaker, a former federal prosecutor who will now oversee special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation, had served as Sessions\u2019 chief of staff since September 2017.\n\nConway and Katyal\u2019s central argument is that a principal officer, such as acting attorney general of the United States, must be confirmed by the Senate. By evading such a procedure, Conway argues, it \u201cdefies one of the one of the explicit checks and balances set out in the Constitution, a provision designed to protect us all against the centralization of government power.\u201d\n\nThe op-ed says the American people \u201ccannot tolerate such an evasion of the Constitution\u2019s very explicit, textually precise design. Senate confirmation exists for a simple, and good, reason.\u201d\n\n\u201cConstitutionally, Matthew Whitaker is a nobody. His job as Mr. Sessions\u2019s chief of staff did not require Senate confirmation,\u201d reads the piece.\n\nChip Somodevilla via Getty Images George Conway, the husband of White House adviser Kellyanne Conway.\n\nConway goes on to say that for Trump to allow Whitaker to take this position is to \u201cbetray the entire structure of our charter document.\u201d\n\nThese sentiments were also recently shared by Andrew Napolitano, senior judicial analyst for Fox News, who said on Wednesday that he believed Trump\u2019s appointment of Whitaker was illegal.\n\n\u201cUnder the law, the person running the Department of Justice must have been approved by the United States Senate for some previous position. Even on an interim post,\u201d Napolitano told Fox News\u2019 Dana Perino.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Matthew Whitaker was named acting U.S. attorney general on Wednesday.\n\nA consistent critic of the president, Conway hasn\u2019t shied away from speaking his mind about Trump and has been extremely vocal in the last few weeks.

His administration announced plans in September 2017 to phase out DACA, arguing that Obama exceeded his constitutional powers when he bypassed Congress and created the program. DACA offers protections to roughly 700,000 young adults, mostly Hispanics, who entered the country as children.\n\nSan Francisco-based U.S. District Judge William Alsup decided in January the government must continue processing renewals of existing DACA applications while litigation over the legality of Trump\u2019s action is resolved.

Ron DeSantis will likely head toward a recount.\n\nAs additional votes were tallied following the general election, DeSantis\u2019 lead narrowed to 0.41 percent, according to the most recent unofficial election results from the Florida Division of Elections as of Thursday afternoon.\n\nThis means the margin is close enough to trigger a machine recount.\n\nDetzner told county election officials on Nov. 8 to prepare for statewide recounts, according to The Tampa Bay Times. \u201cThe recounts will be nationally watched ...

Bill Nelson (D-Fla.). The margin of victory in that race has narrowed to 0.15 percent, which places it in manual recount territory.\n\n(Editor\u2019s Note: The vote margins mentioned in this story change frequently and will be updated often.)\n\nGillum conceded the election on Nov. 6 around 11 p.m., about three hours after the polls closed.\n\n\u201cI sincerely regret that I couldn\u2019t bring it home for you, but I can guarantee you this: I\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d he said during a tearful, 10 minute speech. \u201cWe\u2019re going to fight.\u201d\n\nBut concession speeches are not legally binding. They are a courteous gesture to one\u2019s opponent out of respect for the democratic process. Gillum could formally decline a recount, but his campaign doesn\u2019t appear to be considering that option.\n\n\u201cOn Tuesday night, the Gillum for Governor campaign operated with the best information available about the number of outstanding ballots left to count,\u201d said Johanna Cervone, the campaign\u2019s communications director, in a statement. \u201cSince that time, it has become clear there are many more uncounted ballots than was originally reported.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur campaign, along with our attorney Barry Richard, is monitoring the situation closely and is ready for any outcome, including a state-mandated recount,\u201d she continued. \u201cMayor Gillum started his campaign for the people, and we are committed to ensuring every single vote in Florida is counted.\u201d\n\nRichard represented former President George W. Bush in the 2000 Florida recount.\n\nCounty election officials have until noon on Nov. 10 to report unofficial results to the state.\n\nWhen additional ballots began narrowing DeSantis\u2019 margin of victory on Nov. 7, Gillum tweeted: \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to seeing every vote counted.\u201d The tweet included a link to an article about an unknown number of outstanding votes in Democratic-stronghold Broward County.\n\nI\u2019m looking forward to seeing every vote counted. https://t.co/WT86K6Od7T \u2014 Andrew Gillum (@AndrewGillum) November 8, 2018\n\nGillum became the first black major-party gubernatorial candidate in Florida\u2019s history when he grabbed the Democratic nomination in August. And with that achievement, racism became the fulcrum of the election.\n\nWithin hours after the primary, DeSantis told Florida voters not to \u201cmonkey this up\u201d by electing Gillum. And then voters received two separate robocalls from a neo-Nazi group in Idaho where a man pretending to be Gillum speaks in a stereotypically exaggerated dialect over drums and jungle noises.

She started taking Klonopin after being diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety, but soon developed a dependency, reaching for the medication daily.\n\n\u201cIt stopped being \u2018I take one when I fly,\u2019 to \u2018I take one when I\u2019m awake,\u2019\u201d she told actor Dax Shepard on his podcast, \u201cArmchair Expert.\u201d\n\nDunham is far from alone when it comes to taking the medication. A growing number of Americans are taking benzodiazepines (also known as \u201cbenzos\u201d), which include common medications such as Ativan, Valium, Xanax and Klonopin, among others. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the number of Americans who filled a benzo prescription increased by 67 percent from 1996 to 2013, from 8.1 million to 13.5 million people.\n\nWhile they are effective in the short-term for anxiety, benzos are the anxiety medications most often overused or abused, said David Hu, the medical director at Behavioral Health of the Palm Beaches in Florida. In fact, up to 44 percent of chronic users of benzos may develop a dependency on the medication, according to research.\n\nHow Benzos Affect Your Brain \u2014 And Where It Can Go Wrong\n\nHero Images via Getty Images\n\nTaking benzos is similar to drinking, according to Stephen Taylor, chief medical officer at Pathway Healthcare in Birmingham, Alabama and the medical director of the Player Assistance/Anti-Drug Program of the National Basketball Association. They work in a similar way to alcohol, providing quick and significant \u2014 yet temporary \u2014 relief of anxiety.\n\nBenzos affect the brain\u2019s GABA receptor, a neurotransmitter that works to suppress nerve activity, or \u201cslow things down,\u201d which leads to a calming effect, said Neeraj Gandotra, chief medical officer at Delphi Behavioral Health Group in Florida.\n\nThe main effects of these medications can be a good thing, especially if you\u2019re dealing with anxiety or panic attacks regularly. However, there can be a major downside, according to Hu.\n\n\u201cThese medications have limited duration of effect and people often feel even more anxious after the medication wears off,\u201d Hu said. \u201cThis can lead to people taking the medication continuously to avoid feeling anxious.\u201d\n\nSimilar to Dunham\u2019s story, this may lead people to start turning to their medication to get through every single day.\n\n\u201cWhile a patient may have taken the pill initially to prevent panic symptoms, now they\u2019re taking it for even the mildest symptoms,\u201d Gandotra said. \u201cThey start taking it prophylactically \u2014 when they wake up, before a meeting, when they go to the grocery store.\u201d\n\nSigns You Or Someone Else Is Using Anti-Anxiety Medication Dangerously\n\nIt\u2019s possible to develop a dependency on or an addiction to benzos, according to experts. And while addiction and dependence are not the same thing, the effects of withdrawal are extremely tough to deal with \u2014 and risky \u2014 for either scenario.\n\nThe trademark of developing a dependence on a prescription is an increase in the amount you take, Taylor said. People can experience this with continued, long-term use of benzos, needing higher and higher doses to achieve the same effect, Hu added. Signs of dependency also include slurring words, moving clumsily or sluggishly, mood shifts and vivid dreams.\n\nIf you\u2019re worried that a friend or family member may be dependent on a benzo, watch for signs that they\u2019re isolating themselves from others who may confront them about their medication use. They might also be irritable or tense, Gandotra said. Other signs of dependency to look out for include a sedated or drowsy appearance, sluggish movements, impaired memory and personality changes over time.\n\n\u201cAddiction is a disease of the brain.\u201d - Stephen Taylor, chief medical officer at Pathway Healthcare in Birmingham, Alabama\n\nAddiction goes further than a dependency, and is considered a very valid and real medical condition that deserves its own treatment.\n\n\u201cAddiction is a disease of the brain,\u201d Taylor said. People who develop addiction may exhibit a loss of control around the drug, continued use of the drug despite negative consequences and impulsive use of the substance without being able to limit themselves, Taylor added.\n\nWhile anyone may develop a tolerance, there are certain risk factors that make certain individuals more prone to substance abuse of any kind. \u201cThe No. 1 risk factor for addiction is a family history of addiction,\u201d Taylor said, such as a parent who had alcoholism. Additionally, people who have coexisting chronic illnesses, those who started using substances at an early age, and those who live with other mental health conditions are at an increased risk of developing an addiction disorder.\n\nThat being said, it\u2019s important to note that even if someone doesn\u2019t have these risk factors, there is a potential to become dependent or addicted, Taylor said. \u201cI\u2019ve had patients with zero risk factors that they were able to identify or report to me, but over time of being on benzos, they developed an addiction.\u201d\n\nWhat Is Benzo Withdrawal?\n\nJeffrey Hamilton via Getty Images\n\nWhether you\u2019re dependent or addicted to the medication, stopping benzo use cold turkey will lead to withdrawal symptoms, Gandrota said. The first signs of withdrawal are tremors or palpitations. Other symptoms include decreased concentration and trouble sleeping, rebound anxiety, muscle stiffness and pain and visual hallucinations.\n\nIt can also lead to seizures, rapid heart rate, elevated blood pressure, and even in some cases, death, if someone was taking more than three or four milligrams per day, Gandotra added.\n\nIf someone had a dependency on the medication, they\u2019ll also need to gradually taper off the usage in order to be able to stop taking it, typically under the advisement of a doctor.\n\n\u201cGetting off benzodiazepines can be risky and should always be done with medical supervision by the prescribing doctor or doctor in another setting,\u201d Hu said. \u201cAddiction treatment centers and detox facilities are often staffed with doctors that specialize in detoxification from benzodiazepines and other aspects of addiction medicine.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s especially important to take note if other medications, specifically opioids, are involved, Taylor said. Both opioids and benzos suppress the part of the brain that controls crucial bodily functions, like breathing and heart rate. Research has found that than 30 percent of overdoses involving opioids also involve benzos.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nWhile there are some benefits to using benzos \u2014 and there\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with taking mental health medication in general \u2014 experts overall recommended that doctors need to exercise more caution and consideration when prescribing benzos since the risk is so high when it comes to long-term use.\n\nAccording to Taylor, medical professionals should be prescribing them only for short-term treatment, only on a very temporary basis, and only to patients who do not have a personal or family history of addiction disorders.\n\n\u201cEspecially in the midst of our opioid epidemic, there\u2019s no time like the present to look at dangers of benzos and develop a new respect and new caution to approach these medications,\u201d Taylor said.", "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau officially apologized Wednesday for his country\u2019s 1939 decision to reject a ship full of Jewish refugees fleeing Nazi Germany.\n\nJewish passengers on the MS St. Louis sought safe haven in Canada after being turned away by governments in Cuba and the United States.

One of them, Ana Maria Gordon, survived a Nazi concentration camp after returning to Europe.\n\nGordon told the Canadian Press that the apology was \u201cvery meaningful\u201d to her \u2015 although she said the emotional scars of surviving the Holocaust still run deep.\n\nGordon said she thinks history is repeating itself today, as \u201cmany people are discriminated against, starving or running for their lives.\u201d", "Michelle McLoughlin / Reuters Jahana Hayes (left), who was named National Teacher of the Year in 2016, on Tuesday won her race to represent Connecticut's 5th Congressional District.\n\nWhen Allyssa DiGiovancarlo was in high school, she remembers, she had a teacher who would always preach the importance of civic engagement, and remind students of the power of the ballot box.\n\nOn Tuesday, DiGiovancarlo, now 20, got to put those teacher\u2019s words into action. She showed up to vote in the midterm elections. She cast a vote for a Connecticut candidate named Jahana Hayes, whose ideas she loved.\n\nThe best part? Hayes was that teacher.\n\nThe 2018 midterm elections featured at least 1,500 former or current teachers and education professionals running for office, according to the National Education Association, the country\u2019s largest teachers union. Pundits and policymakers watched those races closely, seeing them as a referendum on the ideas that bolstered the teacher protests that swept states like Arizona and West Virginia this spring.\n\nThe teachers\u2019 students, former and current, were watching too.\n\nFor DiGiovancarlo, watching Jahana Hayes run for \u2015 and win \u2015 a seat in Congress felt like a personal triumph. Hayes\u2019 story of starting off as a single, teenage mother, before going on to have a successful career in education, had always resonated with DiGiovancarlo. The candidacy only cemented her admiration of Hayes.\n\n\u201cIt shows me that just because I\u2019m living in Waterbury, Connecticut, it doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t grow and be great,\u201d said DiGiovancarlo, who is now in college.\n\nThe NEA had no official tally of how many current and former educators had won their races as of Wednesday afternoon. But the early view from union leaders is that the 2018 elections delivered a victory for public education nationwide, despite pockets of disappointments around the country.\n\n\u201cEducation had a good night last night,\u201d NEA President Lily Eskelsen Garcia told HuffPost on Wednesday. \u201cNobody expects to win every race there is. But we saw wins up and down the ballot, and we are on fire.\u201d\n\nHayes, a former National Teacher of the Year, is heading to Congress from Connecticut. Rep. Tim Walz (D), a high school geography teacher by trade, won the race to become Minnesota\u2019s next governor. Former teacher and state school Superintendent Tony Evers will become Wisconsin\u2019s next governor after defeating incumbent Scott Walker, who earned the ire of teachers in 2011 for attacking their right to collectively bargain.\n\nCurrent and former educators won races for state auditor in Minnesota, secretary of state in Michigan and even state land commissioner in New Mexico \u2015 a position that oversees vital school land trusts that in recent years have been sold off to oil companies and other businesses, to the dismay of teachers and public education advocates. In Kentucky, where teachers shut down schools in protest amid budget and pension cuts in April, a record 51 educators ran in state legislative races Tuesday. Fourteen of them won, according to the Louisville Courier-Journal.\n\nDemocrats\u2019 success in flipping governors\u2019 seats \u2015 seven so far \u2015 also led to wins for Govs.-elect Gretchen Whitmer in Michigan and Michelle Lujan Grisham in New Mexico, both of whom campaigned as public education advocates.\n\n\u201cEveryone who flipped a gubernatorial seat ran on a platform of health care, infrastructure and public education,\u201d said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, the union that represents nearly 2 million educators nationwide. \u201cIt is a good day when you have eight more governors who want to actually make public education and student success a priority, and want to work with teachers, not against them.\u201d\n\nThe results weren\u2019t uniformly rosy, however. There were also significant letdowns.\n\nIn Arizona, David Garcia \u2015 an Arizona State University professor and former state Department of Education official \u2015 lost his race to unseat Republican Gov. Doug Ducey. In Florida, Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum (D) appears to have fallen just short in the governor\u2019s race after campaigning on a pro-teacher, pro-public education platform. (The race could still receive a recount.) In Oklahoma, site of a high-profile teachers\u2019 strike earlier this year, Republican Kevin Stitt defeated Democrat Drew Edmondson, who\u2019d supported tax increases to fund raises for teachers.\n\nBut even those setbacks were accompanied by signs of progress for public education advocates. Arizona voters rejected a ballot measure that would have resulted in a massive expansion of the state\u2019s education voucher program. In Florida, voters approved new taxes to fund public education and teacher pay in several major counties.\n\nLooking ahead, the more intangible effects of teachers\u2019 involvement in this election cycle could echo far beyond statehouses, and far beyond 2018.\n\nChristine Marsh, a Democrat in Arizona who has spent decades as a high school English teacher, is still locked in a battle for state Senate, her race too close to call. On Wednesday, while the votes were still being counted, she returned to the classroom.\n\nWe\u2019re still awaiting the results from my race. I\u2019m grateful, blessed, humbled, and inspired by so many people who helped in the past 534 days. This morning I\u2019m back in the classroom doing the important work of preparing our future leaders to lead.\n\nThank YOU. \u2014 Christine Marsh for Senate--LD28 (@ChristinePMarsh) November 7, 2018\n\nBut for her former student Judith Giller-Leinwohl, winning is almost besides the point. Marsh created opportunities for herself. She was ballsy. She got legions of students to pay attention to a state Senate race. And she stuck to her values.\n\nMarsh had always been a force of good in the classroom. To see her take her energy outside of school \u2015 while remaining a fierce advocate for her students \u2015 was heartening, said Giller-Leinwohl, 26.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so powerful for her students to see she isn\u2019t just talk about some of this,\u201d Giller-Leinwohl said. \u201cShe really put it into action.\u201d", "\u201cIt was done in retaliation for his challenging questions at today\u2019s press conference,\u201d CNN said Wednesday in a tweeted statement.\n\nDuring the exchange, Trump called Acosta a \u201crude, terrible person\u201d because the reporter refused to sit down after asking the president about a racist anti-immigration ad he promoted ahead of Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections.", "Warning: Spoiler below.\n\nWay to go all circle of life, \u201cModern Family.\u201d\n\nJust weeks after the sitcom killed off DeDe Pritchett (Shelley Long), it knocked up her granddaughter Haley (Sarah Hyland) on Wednesday\u2019s episode.\n\nYep, Haley is pregnant and the dad could be Dylan (Reid Ewing) or perhaps even ex-boyfriend Arvin (Chris Geere).\n\nThe reveal came after a bumper-car collision with Dylan shoved a lipstick in her nose, \u201cToday\u201d reported. So they went to the hospital and inadvertently got the baby news.\n\nFans of the show might have already expected that she was expecting, especially after Hyland posted this hint.\n\nAfter the episode aired, she showed off her fake baby bump.\n\nReaction to Haley\u2019s baby-on-the-way was mixed:", "A 69-year-old man in the Netherlands wants to prove it\u2019s legally possible to be as old as you feel.\n\nEmile Ratelband has filed a lawsuit against the Dutch government requesting that his date of birth be switched from March 11, 1949, to March 11, 1969.\n\nRatelband, a media personality and motivational guru specializing in self-awareness, compares his attempt to turn back the clock to identifying as transgender.\n\n\u201cWe live in a time when you can change your name and change your gender.

They are regular thots \u2014 to clarify, \u201cthot\u201d is not being used in a derogatory sense here; I love thots \u2014 but with an extra side of racism. And they are everywhere.\n\nTwitter users @WannasWorld and @yeahboutella (who, to clarify, did not coin and disapprove of the term \u201cblackface thot\u201d) began the conversation earlier this week with threads calling out white women online darkening their skin to look black or racially ambiguous.\n\nOn Wednesday, a Twitter user going by the name \u201cniggerfished\u201d (a concept wherein white people pose as black people online) published a well-curated thread featuring all the white influencers and internet celebs who have built up followings by posting pics of themselves rocking cornrows and suspiciously bronzed skin.\n\nSeventeen\n\nSome of the culprits include Swedish influencer Emma Hallberg, YouTuber Mika Francis and Instagram users Hannah Winifred Tittensor, liisaleetma, itsleana___ and jaiahfern. HuffPost reached out for comment to all the women listed. In a response, Tittensor, the only woman to respond thus far, denied the blackface allegations.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t paint myself, I tan,\u201d Tittensor explained via Instagram message, \u201cI use tanning beds to tan my skin I do not intend to try and switch races or pretend that I am white but I tan.\u201d\n\nLike Tittensor, the majority of the young women embodying this aesthetic aren\u2019t pulling a Rachel Dolezal. They do not necessarily claim to be black women \u2015 they just like looking like them, a distinction that makes this phenomenon all the more thorny. How do you even begin to approach someone in blackface who believes what they\u2019re doing is not blackface?\n\nThough the level of skin-darkening varies from user to user, all of them seem to rely heavily on tanning, bronzers and makeup foundations several shades darker then their own complexions to achieve a black or racially ambiguous look.\n\nThey couple their chocolate-adjacent skin with other typically black female markers like plumped lips, cornrows, braids, lacefront closures with babyhairs and doorknocker earrings. Individually, these additions would be one thing. Altogether, they create a bizarre and transparent attempt to synthesize the black aesthetic, perfected by black Insta-baddies and stolen by the patron saint of blackface thots, Kylie Jenner.\n\nFirst off:\n\n\n\nEmma Hallberg\n\n\n\nSwedish Instagram figure.\n\n\n\nClaims she never posed as a \u201ccolored\u201d person, but has clearly used foundation shades darker than her actual skin tone, altered her hair to appear more textured, and edited her photos to appear more darker. pic.twitter.com/hEcVNYjd2o \u2014 yall fake niggers are going to JAIL!!!!!! (@niggerfished) November 7, 2018\n\nWhat makes these girls so fascinating is the bizarre extremes they go to not to look white. (And no, black women straightening their hair or going blonde is not comparable for a myriad of reasons that are too obvious to even go into.) The amount of makeup and bronzer they use, the consistency with which they cling to ambiguity, makes Kylie Jenner and the rest of the Kardashian clan look subtle by comparison.\n\nThe thing that isn\u2019t often said about blackface is just how hilarious it is. Not in the context it was born, mind you, in the days of minstrelsy, but in a modern context. So much time is spent explaining why, yes, it\u2019s still offensive that we forget how ridiculous it is, too.\n\nThe aesthetic of the blackface thot is so garish, so laden with dysmorphia and denial, that it goes past the point of offensiveness. The question isn\u2019t \u201cWhy do y\u2019all keep doing this shit?\u201d It\u2019s \u201cIs this what you actually want to look like? Is this what black women look like to you?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s genuinely funny that these are the lengths that a certain segment of non-black women will go to not to look like themselves. It\u2019s funny that there are black girls out there, right now, who look like that (but better), and do so just by waking up in the morning. It\u2019s funny that despite this fact, influencers like Hallberg and @liisaleetma have thousands upon thousands of followers who like their pictures, fawn over them, and give them the gratification and validation they seek by affecting an aesthetic that does not belong to them.", "\u201cThe Real\u201d host and \u201cSister, Sister\u201d star Tamera Mowry-Housley is grieving over the death of her niece, Alaina Housley, who was killed at a Thousand Oaks, California bar Wednesday night when a mass shooter opened fire.\n\n\u201cWe just learned that our niece Alaina was one of the victims of last night\u2019s shooting at Borderline bar in Thousand Oaks,\u201d the actress and husband Adam Housley said in a joint statement to BuzzFeed News on Thursday. \u201cAlaina was an incredible young woman with so much life ahead of her and we are devastated that her life was cut short in this manner.

Schneiderman speaks during a news conference in New York. (AP Photo/Mary Altaffer, File)\n\nBy MICHAEL BALSAMO and MICHAEL SISAK, Associated Press\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The special prosecutor appointed to investigate allegations that former New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman physically abused women said Thursday that she has closed the case without bringing criminal charges.\n\nNassau County District Attorney Madeline Singas announced her decision in a brief statement. She said investigators did an \u201cexhaustive review\u201d and she personally interviewed each woman who had accused Schneiderman of assault. Investigators also spoke with members of Schneiderman\u2019s security detail.\n\nShe concluded that statutes of limitations and other \u201clegal impediments\u201d made it impossible to charge Schneiderman. The probe found no misconduct by Schneiderman\u2019s staff in the attorney general\u2019s office, she said.\n\nSchneiderman said he didn\u2019t consider the decision an exoneration.\n\n\u201cI recognize that District Attorney Singas\u2019 decision not to prosecute does not mean I have done nothing wrong,\u201d he said through a publicist. \u201cI accept full responsibility for my conduct in my relationships with my accusers, and for the impact it had on them.\n\n\u201cAfter spending time in a rehab facility, I am committed to a lifelong path of recovery and making amends to those I have harmed. I apologize for any and all pain that I have caused, and I apologize to the people of the State of New York for disappointing them after they put their trust in me.\u201d\n\nSchneiderman, a Democrat, resigned from office in May hours after The New Yorker published an expose saying that four women had accused him of slapping or choking them. Some of the women said Schneiderman was a heavy drinker.\n\nSchneiderman at the time didn\u2019t deny the allegations, but implied in a statement that his conduct was either welcomed or was not as the women described.\n\nHis accusers included Manning Barish, a Democratic activist and writer, who was romantically involved with Schneiderman from mid-2013 through the end of 2014.", "Perhaps the most promising development for progressive Democrats in Tuesday\u2019s elections came from ballot initiatives in conservative territory. Over the course of the evening, progressives notched policy victory after policy victory in red state after red state.\n\nVoters raised the minimum wage in Arkansas and Missouri. They expanded Medicaid coverage to more than 300,000 people in Utah, Nebraska and Idaho. In Florida, they restored voting rights to over 1.2 million convicted felons \u2015 a civil rights victory that will transform the state\u2019s electorate of 16 million. Utah \u2015 Utah! \u2015 legalized medical marijuana.\n\nMost of these initiatives weren\u2019t close. The Arkansas minimum wage hike cleared by a margin of more than 2-to-1. The similar Missouri measure passed by nearly 30 percentage points, about even with the vote on an August primary measure to help unions in the state. Florida\u2019s voting rights amendment passed 64 percent to 36 percent.\n\nAnd yet even as they endorsed Democratic Party policy ideas, voters in these same states rejected actual Democratic candidates for statewide office. The Arkansas governor\u2019s race was essentially a formality for Republican incumbent Asa Hutchinson. Mitt Romney coasted into office as the next senator from Utah, while the Senate and gubernatorial contests in Nebraska never approached anything like competitiveness. Missouri Democrat Claire McCaskill lost her Senate re-election bid by more than 140,000 votes, while in Florida, Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum came up about 54,000 votes shy of the governor\u2019s mansion and Sen. Bill Nelson called for a recount after appearing to lose his bid for re-election.\n\nPart of the problem is what political consultants politely refer to as \u201ccandidate quality.\u201d Two years ago, McCaskill tweeted a photo of herself enjoying a watermelon mojito at a vacation home she and her husband share with Rick DeStefane, a nursing home magnate embroiled in controversies including safety lapses tied to gruesome deaths and a federal Medicare fraud settlement (McCaskill\u2019s husband and DeStefane have been business partners). The 76-year-old Nelson, meanwhile, inexplicably sat out much of the 2018 campaign season and struggled to appear relevant once he hit the trail. At a recent rally in Miami, he invoked \u201cHappy Days Are Here Again\u201d \u2015 Franklin Delano Roosevelt\u2019s campaign song from 1932. Gillum was hampered by an FBI investigation into his professional relationships with two lobbyists.\n\nBut those personal faults can explain only so much. In state after state, Democrats just aren\u2019t anywhere near as popular as their ideas. In rural America, the Democratic Party\u2019s brand is toxic.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to talk meaningfully about the dynamics of partisanship and American conservatism without reckoning with race. President Donald Trump spent much of his 2016 campaign embracing traditionally Democratic ideas about trade, campaign finance and financial regulation without suffering any major setbacks with the Republican base. GOP voters were willing to compromise on the party\u2019s trickle-down economic orthodoxy when the heresy was combined with hefty doses of white grievance and authoritarian spectacle. Trump did his best to define the midterms with the latter two, raining down conspiracy theories about his nefarious caravan.\n\nMany Trump voters may well be fine with higher working-class wages, so long as they aren\u2019t directly confronted with who many of those working-class folks are. It certainly seems like voters in Utah, Idaho and Nebraska are more amenable to at least one tenet of Obamacare \u2015 the Medicaid expansion \u2015 when it isn\u2019t being marketed by the first black president.\n\nFlorida\u2019s gubernatorial campaign was the most overtly racist statewide contest in an election year defined by overtly racist messaging from the Republican Party and its allies. Gillum\u2019s opponent, former Rep. Ron DeSantis, warned voters not to \u201cmonkey this up\u201d while neo-Nazis sent out appalling anti-Gillum robo-calls filled with primate screeches, anti-Semitic conspiracy theorizing and warnings about \u201cputting Negroes in charge over the white folk.\u201d\n\nAnd yet Florida\u2019s voting rights restoration is primarily a triumph for working-class black men. Two things were happening in the same electorate: White voters rejected a black candidate in favor of his race-baiting opponent as they approved a pro-black civil rights initiative. For hundreds of thousands of voters, the ballot initiative didn\u2019t set off the same alarm bells that a black candidate did.\n\nIn state after state, Democrats just aren\u2019t anywhere near as popular as their ideas. In rural America, the Democratic Party\u2019s brand is toxic.\n\nThis was partly a result of artful messaging and convenient allies on the voting rights effort. The billionaire Koch brothers supported it, immunizing it from some forms of conservative opposition, while advocates presented it as a multi-racial project that would free white and white-collar convicts from injustice alongside black felons.\n\nBut whatever the magic formula, the success of these efforts demonstrates that Democrats can secure policy outcomes they like even when they can\u2019t overcome partisan dynamics in statewide elections. The very fact that red state voters like Democratic ideas \u2015 even if they don\u2019t really like Democrats themselves \u2015 is itself an opportunity to detoxify the party\u2019s brand with much of the country.\n\nThat is, if the party can find the right messengers. Unlike the 2018 election, 2016 was almost universally disastrous for Democrats. One of the few bright spots was in Oklahoma, where a small team of ambitious organizers decided to fight a statewide \u201cright to farm\u201d ballot initiative. Right-to-farm laws are designed to protect big corporate factory farm operations from environmental, food safety and humanitarian regulations, and they often do well in rural states where Big Ag dominates the economic landscape. But in Oklahoma two years ago, organizers convinced family farmers, environmental conservationists, animal welfare advocates and a healthy crop of urban liberals to reject the measure. Big Ag lost by 20 points.\n\n\u201cDemocrats don\u2019t have to throw out their values,\u201d the campaign\u2019s organizer, Joe Maxwell, told HuffPost last year. \u201cDemocrats don\u2019t even have to abandon their issues. It\u2019s about how you frame it. It\u2019s about connecting with people and showing them how your ideas fit with their values.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the biggest surprise in Tuesday night\u2019s election returns was in Oklahoma, where Kendra Horn became the first Democrat to represent the 5th Congressional District since 1975.

TAMMANY PARISH, La. \u2015 Mystery and suspense make for good TV, and \u201cPeople Magazine Investigates\u201d appeared to deliver both to viewers who tuned in this week to the premiere episode of the new season, which documented the unsolved slaying of a Louisiana fire chief\u2019s wife.\n\n\u201cIs it possible someone figured out how to commit the perfect murder?\u201d narrator and People editor in chief Jess Cagle teased during the show, which aired Monday night on the Investigation Discovery cable network.\n\nThe episode spun an intriguing web of sex, lies and death in the case of 49-year-old Nanette Krentel \u2015 details that likely captivated every armchair detective watching.\n\nHowever, as fascinating as it might have seemed to watch pieces of a real-life puzzle being shuffled from one theory to the next, the program failed to assemble a complete picture of the case. According to an investigator who spoke with HuffPost on the condition of anonymity, this is due to the fact that it\u2019s \u201call for naught.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe know what happened,\u201d said the investigator, who wasn\u2019t authorized to discuss the case and didn\u2019t want to be named.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no mystery\u201d about who is responsible for taking Krentel\u2019s life, the investigator added. If anything, the source said, mystery surrounds a decision made in the days following Krentel\u2019s 2017 death.\n\nSt. Tammany Fire District 12 Nanette and Steve Krentel.\n\nKrentel, a former preschool teacher, was found dead by firefighters picking through the remnants of the burned-out home she had shared with her husband, Steve Krentel. At the time, he was chief of St. Tammany Fire District 12. He\u2019s since resigned.\n\nThe fire was reported shortly after 2:30 p.m. on July 14, 2017. Firefighters from several fire districts were dispatched to the home, which was fully ablaze when the first units arrived, according to the St. Tammany Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office.\n\nInvestigators initially speculated that Nanette Krentel, whose body was found in the master bathroom, died while trying to save her cats, Baby Kitty and Smokey, and her chihuahua, Harley, who was found nearby.\n\nNanette Krentel\u2019s body was burned beyond recognition. DNA was used to confirm her identity, a spokesman for the St. Tammany Parish Coroner\u2019s Office told HuffPost at the time.\n\nBut the case took a sinister turn on July 21, 2017, when authorities announced that the autopsy showed Nanette Krentel died of a gunshot wound. Investigators also determined the fire had been intentionally set after fuel had been poured throughout the living room and master bedroom.\n\n\u201cWe are diligently working on this case, and our detectives will continue to work until we have all of the answers,\u201d Sheriff Randy Smith said at the time.\n\nDr. Charles Preston, the parish coroner, found neither soot nor ash in Krentel\u2019s lungs, which he said clearly indicated she was dead before the fire. He ruled her death a homicide.\n\nNanette\u2019s father, Dan Watson, who was on \u201cPeople Magazine Investigates,\u201d said he\u2019s convinced someone killed his daughter.\n\n\u201cThe minute I heard that she had died, I knew she had been murdered,\u201d Watson told People.\n\nInvestigators initially looked at Steve Krentel. Although he freely admitted he had an affair prior to his wife\u2019s death, he had a solid alibi and passed a polygraph test. Nanette\u2019s family said she was considering ending the marriage due to the affair, but Steve Krentel said the couple had worked through it.\n\nInvestigators next turned their attention to Steve Krentel\u2019s son, Justin. There were reportedly issues between Justin and his stepmother, but he was cleared when it was proved he was out of state when she died.\n\nDavid Lohr Authorities say there's still an active investigation into Nanette Krentel's death.\n\nSteve Krentel\u2019s brother, Brian Krentel, also fell under suspicion. He had a lengthy criminal record and supposedly suspected Nanette of calling the cops on him in 2015, which led to him being jailed for drug paraphernalia.\n\n\u201cBrian was definitely somebody that I was worried about because Brian had strong contempt for Nanette,\u201d Steve Krentel said on the episode of \u201cPeople Magazine Investigates.\u201d\n\nBut Brian Krentel was cleared. He was on electronic monitoring at the time, and law officers viewed surveillance camera footage of him at his parents\u2019 house, about 15 miles away, on the day of his sister-in-law\u2019s death.\n\nA surveillance system had been installed at the Krentel residence prior to the fire. Although it might have captured what happened on the day of the blaze, the recording was so damaged that not even the FBI could salvage it.\n\n\u201cPeople Magazine Investigates\u201d implied that whoever is responsible for Nanette Krentel\u2019s death had taken steps to ensure that the fire destroyed the surveillance footage. It could also be argued that an intruder would have taken the video recorder instead of risking leaving the footage to be found by investigators.\n\nPeople Steve and Nanette Krentel.\n\nSheriff Smith made an appearance in the \u201cPeople Magazine Investigates\u201d episode, but offered no new information in the case. According to the law enforcement source who spoke with HuffPost, this was because investigators disagreed with the coroner\u2019s ruling of homicide in Nanette Krentel\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cA handgun was found next to her body, and it appears the [bullet] entered here,\u201d the source said, placing a finger below and to the left of this reporter\u2019s right temple.\n\n\u201cThe bullet did not exit the skull \u2015 it lodged in the soft tissue \u2015 but the fire was so intense that [ballistic tests] could not be performed on the handgun,\u201d the investigator added.\n\nThe caliber of the bullet, authorities said, matches the gun found next to the body. They didn\u2019t elaborate.\n\nInvestigators firmly believe Nanette Krentel died by suicide, according to the investigator who spoke with HuffPost. They discount the theory that she was dead prior to the fire. As the source said, investigators believe Krentel could have set the fire, then stepped into the master bathroom and fired a fatal shot into her head.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t understand the coroner\u2019s ruling,\u201d the source said. \u201cThis is a suicide.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe said it\u2019s 70% murder, 30% suicide \u2026 you\u2019re either pregnant or you\u2019re not,\u201d Nanette Krentel\u2019s sister, Wendy Watson, said of authorities in an August interview with New Orleans WVUE-DT.\n\nNanette Krentel\u2019s best friend, Lori Rando, told \u201cPeople Magazine Investigates\u201d that her friend had exhibited signs of depression.\n\n\u201cThe last few months of her life, Nanette started pulling away,\u201d Rando said. \u201cThere was less and less contact between her and her friends and family.\u201d\n\nSteve Krentel described his wife as being proficient with firearms. He said she owned four or five guns and never went anywhere without one.\n\nThe day the coroner announced he had classified the case a homicide, the sheriff released a statement saying he did not necessarily support that conclusion. But the sheriff backed off the next day, The Advocate reported in January.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether law enforcement will continue to treat the case as a whodunnit. The sheriff\u2019s office declined to discuss the unnamed investigator\u2019s contention that authorities believe the death was suicide.\n\n\u201cThe Nanette Krentel case is an active and ongoing investigation, and no additional information is available at this time,\u201d said sheriff\u2019s Capt. Scott Lee.\n\nThe coroner, in a Thursday email to HuffPost, declined to comment on specifics of the investigation. Preston said he disagrees with the information the source shared with HuffPost and contended he ruled the case a homicide after \u201ccareful consideration of the totality of the evidence.\u201d\n\nAnyone with information is asked to contact the St. Tammany Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office at 985-898-2338 or Crimestoppers at 504-822-1111.\n\nSend David Lohr an email or follow him on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nIf you or someone you know needs help, call 1-800-273-8255 for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.

To Affordable Groceries.\u201d Corporations such as Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and Keurig Dr Pepper funded a reported $20 million campaign that advertised the tax as being for groceries, which are generally tax-exempt in the state, and not explicitly sweetened drinks.\n\nOpponents of the measure argued that taxes on sugary drinks are beneficial because they significantly reduce sugar consumption. Eating or drinking too much sugar has been tied to health issues like obesity, which itself has been linked to diabetes, heart disease and cancer.\n\nOne study published in 2016 found a 21 percent decrease in soda consumption and an increase in water consumption when a tax was imposed on sugar-sweetened beverages in Berkeley, California.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Measure 1634, dubbed \u201cYes! To Affordable Groceries,\u201d banned imposing any new taxes to groceries, which are generally tax-free. It was largely funded by beverage giants Coca-Cola and PepsiCo after similar taxes were imposed on sugary drinks in places like Seattle.\n\nThe Seattle Times said it opposed the measure, and called it an \u201cindustry-funded campaign.\u201d\n\n\u201cVoters should reject I-1634 so that local governments can continue to decide for themselves how to best address these health issues in their communities,\u201d the publication said in an editorial. It also dismissed claims that essential \u201cgroceries\u201d will face new taxes if a soda tax is imposed since most food items are already tax-exempt in Washington and reversing that is unlikely.\n\nAdvocates of the measure, in contrast, argued that individuals should be allowed to decide for themselves which products they want to buy without the government intervening.\n\n\u201cWe think individuals should make their own choices about such matters without government coercion or monetary punishment,\u201d Washington\u2019s Spokesman-Review said in an editorial. \u201cEducation is a far better method of reducing consumption of unhealthy food.\u201d\n\nTaxes on sugary drinks will remain in Washington\u2019s cities that have already imposed such measures, like Seattle, but the tax will not be allowed to increase.\n\nSimilar taxes are in places in cities such as San Francisco, Philadelphia and Oakland, California, even though California earlier this year banned any new taxes on food and beverages until 2031.", "As many as 30 people at Borderline on Wednesday night also attended last year\u2019s Las Vegas festival, music fan Cory Spellman, 27, told HuffPost.

Nathan Deal on Thursday morning, and it is effective at 11:59 a.m.\n\nThe state said Kemp will not perform any election-related duties Thursday.\n\nThe announcement came ahead of a scheduled hearing Thursday for a lawsuit in which five Georgia voters asked that Kemp be barred from exercising his duties as the state\u2019s chief elections officer in any future management of his own election tally.\n\nDemocratic candidate Stacey Abrams has pointed to ballots that have yet to be counted and says there\u2019s still the possibility of a December runoff in one of the nation\u2019s marquee midterm races.\n\nAssociated Press\n\nIn an interview with WSB Radio on Thursday, Kemp said he and his campaign are declaring victory because it isn\u2019t possible for Abrams to pick up enough votes to force a Dec. 4 runoff.\n\nAbrams\u2019 campaign has said there are still enough uncounted votes to force a runoff and that they need to pick up about 15,000 votes to do so.\n\nKemp said his rival\u2019s campaign is using \u201cold math.\u201d Without providing specifics, he said in the radio interview that the number \u201cis actually more like 30,000 votes.\u201d\n\nThe Abrams campaign continues to accuse Kemp of improperly using his current post as secretary of state.\n\nThe Associated Press has not called the election.\n\n\u201cWe are declaring victory,\u201d Kemp aide Ryan Mahoney told reporters on a conference call late Wednesday, after a day of the campaigns, media and partisan observers scrambling for information about outstanding votes across Georgia\u2019s 159 counties. Another campaign official, Austin Chambers, added: \u201cThe message here is pretty simple: This election is over, and the results are clear.\u201d\n\nAbrams\u2019 campaign manager Lauren Groh-Wargo retorted a few hours later that the Kemp campaign offered \u201cno proof\u201d other than nonspecific provisional ballots counts released by Kemp\u2019s official state office.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s offered ... no indication of why we should take him at his word,\u201d Groh-Wargo said. \u201cThe sitting secretary of state has declared himself\u201d the winner.\n\nThe standoff leaves open the possibility of litigation as Abrams\u2019 campaign has pushed for the continued counting of absentee, mail-in and provisional ballots and renewed its concerns that Kemp remains the chief elections officer supervising his own election, a race already marked by disputes over the voting process.\n\nIf a runoff is necessary, the second round would take place Dec. 4, extending Abrams\u2019 bid to become the first black woman elected governor in American history while Kemp looks to maintain the GOP\u2019s domination in a state where Democrats haven\u2019t won a governor\u2019s race since 1998.\n\nPartisan observers nationally have watched intently for clues about just how much of a battleground Georgia can be in the 2020 presidential campaign.\n\nWith reported votes exceeding 3.9 million \u2014 almost 95 percent of Georgia\u2019s 2016 presidential turnout \u2014 Kemp has just more than 50 percent.\n\nBefore the Kemp campaign declared victory Wednesday, Groh-Wargo estimated that about 15,000 votes separate Kemp from a runoff. She says at least that many outstanding absentee and mail-in ballots remained to be counted.\n\nKemp\u2019s spokeswoman in the secretary of state\u2019s office, Candice Broce, said that by Wednesday afternoon the number of uncounted absentee and mail-in ballots was less than 2,000 \u2014 with her boss still above the 50 percent threshold.\n\nBroce said about 22,000 provisional ballots have yet to be processed, according to a canvass of county officials across the state. Mahoney asserted that those numbers make it impossible for Abrams to pick up enough votes to deny Kemp an outright victory.\n\nIn 2016, with a slightly larger electorate, there were 16,739 provisional ballots. Of those, 7,592 were counted. State and campaign officials said they expected a much higher proportion to be counted this year.\n\nKemp\u2019s office has not released a county-by-county breakdown of provisional ballots, but Abrams\u2019 campaign said they believe they are concentrated in metro Atlanta counties where Abrams won a large share of the vote. Broce said Kemp\u2019s office is working on releasing more detailed information.\n\nThe lawsuit at issue Thursday in an Atlanta federal court comes from voters who sued Kemp on Election Day alleging that Kemp presiding over an election in which he is a candidate \u201cviolates a basic notion of fairness.\u201d The plaintiffs are asking the court to block Kemp from having anything more to do with managing his election.\n\nIt\u2019s not immediately clear what Kemp\u2019s practical role was in the election tally. Local officials are responsible for counting the votes, including provisional ballots. County officials have until next Tuesday to certify their results and send them to Kemp\u2019s office. Statewide certification must come by Nov. 20.", "Survivors of a mass shooting in southern California on Wednesday night that left at least 13 dead, including the gunman, have begun sharing harrowing accounts of their escape from the deadly scene.\n\nMatt Wennerstrom, 20, said he had spent 30 minutes or so inside Borderline Bar & Grill in Thousand Oaks, located roughly 40 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles, before the first round of gunshots rang out.\n\n\u2033I grabbed as many people as I possibly could around me, everyone, and got them below the pool table ... until we heard the shots stop,\u201d Wennerstrom told CBS News. \u201cAt that point, I knew [the gunman] was reloading and there was not much he was going to be able to do.\u201d\n\nWennerstrom said he saw another person throw a barstool through a window to escape so he \u201cfollowed suit,\u201d directing people out before the next round of shots were fired.\n\n\u201cWe just pushed people towards the bar so they weren\u2019t in the direct line of sight of him and then just filed as many people \u2015 everyone that was there in that area \u2015 out through that back window,\u201d he said.\n\nWitness tells @CarterEvans when the gunman was in the bar, he saw someone throw a bar stool through the window, so he did the same and pushed people towards the bar so they weren't in direct line of sight of the gunman https://t.co/lrdq6jGcKE pic.twitter.com/oXFAtgRDXb \u2014 CBS This Morning (@CBSThisMorning) November 8, 2018\n\nWennerstrom, in an earlier interview with KABC, estimated he helped about 30 to 35 people escape the attack.\n\n\u201cAs soon as I heard the shots, I knew exactly what was going on,\u201d he told KABC. \u201cI\u2019m here to protect my friends, my family, my fellow humans, and I know where I\u2019m going if I die so I was not worried to sacrifice.

Taking America\u2019s political climate into account, he said, he ultimately decided that recording a holiday album felt the most appropriate.\n\n\u201cI think [the idea] came to me at a time when I personally needed Christmas,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I hope that this album does that for other people \u2015 that it lightens their load.\u201d\n\nDirty Sugar The \"Jersey Boys\" and \"Hairspray\" star said the holidays have always held a special significance, and for good reason: He met his now-husband at a 2008 Christmas party.\n\nAs it turns out, the holiday season has deep resonance for Longoria, who met his husband, Taylor, at a Christmas party in 2008. The California native references the early days of his relationship on \u201cMerry Me This Christmas,\u201d a new song he co-wrote with musical director Rona Siddiqui for the album.\n\nUltimately, he hopes listeners are encouraged to \u201cgive their own hearts away\u201d over the holiday season after listening to the track.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t stop what the heart wants. The heart, the universe or whatever you want to call it brought us together at that Christmas party,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s all written in that song.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, Longoria \u2015 who will celebrate his one-year wedding anniversary Dec. 10 \u2015 admits he still takes pause when people reference Taylor publicly as his husband.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still weird, odd and amazingly beautiful to say it and hear it,\u201d he said. \u201cTo know that my experience is [connected] to the experience of the entire gay community and everyone who is standing up and fighting for equal rights ... it\u2019s pretty awesome to have somebody to stand up with you for that.\u201d", "Tap here to turn on desktop notifications to get the news sent straight to you.", "During her lifetime, Lee Israel was the living embodiment of the age-old adage \u201ccrime pays.\u201d\n\nIsrael, who died in 2014, spent two years in the early 1990s writing forgeries of letters by the likes of No\u00ebl Coward, Ernest Hemingway and Dorothy Parker, and then auctioning them off to collectors for then-hefty sums. Though the New York-based writer had early success with her biographies of Tallulah Bankhead and game show panelist Dorothy Kilgallen, she had no literary prospects and was on welfare prior to turning to fraud. (Check out a scene from the film above.)\n\nAfter a number of false starts, Israel\u2019s story finally made it to the big screen this fall in \u201cCan You Ever Forgive Me?\u201d The film, which opened in limited release Oct. 19 and expanded to additional theaters nationwide Nov. 2, stars Melissa McCarthy as Israel and Richard E. Grant as her best friend, Jack Hock.\n\nMcCarthy has earned a flush of early awards season buzz for her portrayal of Israel, and for good reason. She brings the fraudster to life with grace and aplomb, finding empathy in a woman whose behavior is criminal and, in some respects, downright despicable.\n\nThe real-life Israel also identified as a lesbian, and McCarthy handles the queer aspect of her character\u2019s identity with appropriate nuance that may surprise fans most familiar with her comedic roles in \u201cBridesmaids\u201d and \u201cGhostbusters,\u201d among other films. Grant, meanwhile, undergoes a radical physical transformation, in his portrayal of the openly gay Hock, who died of an AIDS-related illness.\n\nMcCarthy recently spoke with HuffPost about the film, why her approach to Israel was \u201cvery different\u201d from her portrayal of former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer on \u201cSNL\u201d and what she hopes a modern LGBTQ audience takes away from her performance.\n\nWhat part of this film tested you the most?\n\nThe play of stillness was a fun challenge. I\u2019ve played so many strong women who have been energy-forward, and there\u2019s more physicality and verbal sparring. Lee was more turned inward. She did a type of deflecting that was more like, \u201cI will wait you out, in hopes that you go away.\u201d And it usually worked. There\u2019s a stillness to her character that I found very interesting.\n\nFocus Features \"I wanted to look at the heart of why she did troubling things,\" Melissa McCarthy (right, with co-star Richard E. Grant) said of con artist Lee Israel, whom she portrays in the new film, \"Can You Ever Forgive Me?\"\n\nHow familiar were you with Lee Israel prior to the film?\n\nI wasn\u2019t, and I felt like I should have been. That was my takeaway when I first read the script. Researching her was challenging. Initially, I thought I\u2019d do a ton of research, watch things. But true to her personality, she didn\u2019t want people in her life and didn\u2019t offer that up [during her lifetime]. Also, she lived at a time before people felt the need to document every moment of their lives, so it\u2019s just not out there.\n\nLuckily, [two of] our producers, David Yarnell and Anne Carey, knew her very well. David was the person who poked, prodded and made her write her memoir, which she did not want to do. She was difficult about it and I think he might have called her \u201ca pain in my ass,\u201d but she finally wrote it. And Carey, for 10 years, was taking her book and trying to turn into a film and meet with Lee for dinner. Carey would always show up and Lee would be waiting there, drink in hand, and once dinner was finished, she\u2019d get up and go before the bill would come.\n\nBy embracing falsehoods, Lee makes her best work. Did you feel a connection to that because as an actor, you\u2019re playing pretend?\n\nI feel like we\u2019re on similar paths in terms of what we do. I don\u2019t want to play someone exactly like myself. I\u2019d be very uncomfortable. As a character, strangely, I have no hesitation in how I do something. It gives me a lot more courage than I have in my normal life.\n\nLee lived through other people. She was a great writer when she could write through someone else\u2019s voice. Turns out she was a great writer either way, but [having] the safety net of standing behind someone \u2026 I really relate to that.\n\nDid it help that you were playing Sean Spicer on \u201cSNL\u201d at the same time?\n\nNo, because Lee is someone I found engaging, and I wanted to look at the heart of why she did troubling things. Whereas with the other one, I was just holding the mirror up. I wasn\u2019t examining him. I just wanted to hold up the mirror and have his own words reflect back because they\u2019re crazy enough. It was a very different world.\n\nFocus Features Israel found solace in Julius,' New York's oldest gay bar, during her lifetime. \"It was another way for her to shield herself,\" McCarthy said.\n\nYou play up Lee\u2019s queerness very matter-of-factly. How was it to make that aspect of her identity so casual?\n\nIt made nothing but sense to me. It\u2019s a part of who you are, and it\u2019s integrated into your being from the beginning. It shouldn\u2019t be like this separate entity that\u2019s added on, like you picked it up along the way.\n\nThis film is sort of a love story between two queer people who are living in New York at a specific moment in history. Is there a message for a modern queer audience you\u2019d like relay in your performance?\n\nThe fact that she went to Julius\u2019 [New York\u2019s longest-operating gay bar] in the early 1990s was very telling of how uncomfortable she was. In the early \u201990s, gay men and lesbians didn\u2019t intermingle. I was at Julius\u2019 in those days and it was not a place to be seen. I think Lee went there because there was a bit of safety in the company, but she would not be bothered. It was another way for her to shield herself. Toward the end, when Jack is losing his battle with AIDS \u2026 at that time in New York, \u201cepidemic\u201d is not a big enough word. It\u2019s a good thing to be reminded of the fact that people now don\u2019t have to shield themselves. Not that long ago, you did.\n\nWhat do you hope audiences take away from the film?\n\nFor me, I hope people will think about seeing the invisible people who are around them all the time. Lee and Jack were just people no one looked at. No one passed by Lee and thought, \u201cI wonder if she\u2019s remarkable.\u201d They were just invisible. How many people do we pass each day that we don\u2019t even look at? Especially today. I hope people look up and actually see people.", "Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg fractured three ribs after she fell in her office on Wednesday night.\n\nGinsburg, 85, was admitted to George Washington University Hospital on Thursday morning, according to a Supreme Court press release.

Women\u2019s rights activists vowed to continue to challenge the change.\n\n\u201cIf the Administration thinks it can move these rules forward without a fight, they\u2019re wrong,\u201d Fatima Goss Graves, president of the National Women\u2019s Law Center, told CNN this week. \u201cCountless women depend on this critical birth control coverage for their health and economic stability \u2015 and we will continue to fiercely defend them.\u201d\n\nBREAKING: The Trump administration just followed through on its promise to allow virtually any employer to invoke religion to deny their employees birth control coverage.\n\n\n\nWe will keep fighting to make sure that religious beliefs are not used for discrimination or harm. pic.twitter.com/7DnzyoEVlq \u2014 ACLU (@ACLU) November 7, 2018\n\nThe Affordable Care Act obligates most employers\u2019 health plans to cover birth control at no charge as a preventive service.

Two of those suits, filed separately by the attorneys general of California and Pennsylvania, led to federal judges in those states granting nationwide injunctions against the rules. Both cases are now before appellate courts.\n\nDespite the ongoing legal battle, the Department of Health and Human Services announced Wednesday that the policy change had been finalized and would take effect in about two months.\n\nThe final rules would apply to religious organizations, nonprofits and small businesses, the department noted, and not to publicly traded businesses or government entities.\n\nThe exemptions to the contraceptive mandate \u201cshould affect no more than approximately 200 employers with religious or moral objections,\u201d HHS said.

It\u2019s the low hum of depression somewhere in between the extremes that I find most terrifying, and it\u2019s a raw place for a man to be. Many people don\u2019t have patience for a man in distress. We\u2019re expected to pull ourselves up, lick our wounds and soldier on.\n\nThings looked good on paper. I\u2019d recently taken a new job, moved to Manhattan and weaned myself off antidepressants with the consent of my doctor. I have a large family who loves and supports me. I have a few friends \u2014 not many \u2014 who are incredibly close to me. I have a meaningful relationship with nature, the outdoors, animals. I belong to none of the numerous marginalized groups whose existence is increasingly threatened in America \u2014 socially, politically, economically \u2014 every single day. Why, in spite of such auspicious circumstances, was I still so enveloped in emotional pain? How did it get this bad?\n\nI\u2019ve always been super sensitive \u2014 the highs are high and the lows are low. In this case, my experience of despair felt severe enough to warrant a higher level of care. I\u2019ve since come to understand the way societal and cultural stigmas against sensitivity in men exacerbate my issues by leading me to deal with them in isolation.\n\nAbout 20 percent of humans are considered highly sensitive people, or HSPs, per research done by Dr. Elaine Aron and others (Aron has written several books on the subject). HSPs tend to show \u201cheightened awareness of and attention to subtle stimuli,\u201d per Aron\u2019s research, and they are \u201cmore reactive to both positive and negative stimuli.\u201d\n\nWhile Aron\u2019s research doesn\u2019t indicate that sensitive folks are predisposed to depression, in my experience, sensitivity and depression nourish each other. When you\u2019re sensitive, everything hits you harder \u2014 sounds, smells, tastes and especially feelings.\n\nThe sensitivity trait was clear to me from a very young age but started to feel like a real problem in adolescence. It always seemed like I felt things deeper than the people around me. In a gaggle of teens, my attention competed with roaring laughter to try to understand why that one person in the crowd looked upset. I burst into tears after my first day of middle school because I was so overwhelmed by the act of changing classes. The daunting sound of a large group of people still rattles me the way walking into the boisterous school cafeteria did.\n\nToday, I start to get overwhelmed about 30 minutes into hanging out at a crowded bar. That\u2019s pretty common for HSPs \u2014 when you feel everything more acutely than others, the end result is almost always being overwhelmed. The decibel levels, the sheer number of people per square foot, and all of it compounded by shame that causes me to try to hide how overwhelmed I am. (After all, it\u2019s a bar and everyone else is having fun.) It all contributes to the idea that there\u2019s something fundamentally wrong with me.\n\nMy sensitivity extends to others\u2019 body language, their mood, their tone of voice \u2014 all of it can indirectly inflict pain. Nearly every disappointed glance anyone has ever shot me is stored in my memory \u2014 from friends and bank tellers alike \u2014 and each new one hurts more than the last.\n\nI distinctly remember leaving the house in high school \u2014 dressed up and ready to go hang out with friends \u2014 when my mother would say something like, \u201cIs that new?\u201d or \u201cWhere\u2019d that come from?\u201d I\u2019d study her body language and general reaction to whatever I was wearing and suddenly the scarf or the color of my pants felt like a mistake.\n\nFor men, the ability to manage your emotions in interpersonal relationships so well that it looks like you don\u2019t have any is the gold standard. Being an HSP makes that complicated.\n\nFor me, all it takes is a little shrug from someone else, signaling potential disapproval, to trigger the rumination process. Whereas, someone with a nervous system that\u2019s a bit more robust might think nothing of such an inquiry. \u201cYep, I just got this scarf. I love it!\u201d\n\nThese things are not supposed to faze men. We are taught from a young age that our worth is in our strength \u2014 both physical and emotional. \u201cMovies, advertisements, the design of public spaces, all tell us we should be as tough as the Terminator, as stoic as Clint Eastwood, as outgoing as Goldie Hawn,\u201d Aron wrote in her book The Highly Sensitive Person. \u201cWe should be pleasantly stimulated by bright lights, noise, a gang of cheerful fellows hanging out in a bar.\u201d\n\nFor men, the ability to manage your emotions in interpersonal relationships so well that it looks like you don\u2019t have any is the gold standard. Being an HSP makes that complicated.\n\nSometimes good-natured ribbing between friends can take a turn and end up really hurting me. Male bonding involves a lot of teasing, and if you can\u2019t \u201ctake it,\u201d you\u2019re thought of as less than.\n\nI recently initiated a conversation with a male friend about how I\u2019d been feeling isolated because I didn\u2019t enjoy typical young-people activities. Going to bars and meeting lots of new people at once are really hard for me, I explained. It\u2019s so easy to become over-stimulated as an HSP, and it\u2019s incredibly lonely to feel misunderstood by non-HSP friends and colleagues.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a therapist,\u201d he quickly rebuffed me.\n\nI clumsily tried to explain that I wasn\u2019t trying to solve anything \u2014 I just needed someone to talk to. His eyes darted elsewhere. He was polite but firm, and the message was clear: Talking about feelings so directly wasn\u2019t welcome.\n\nIn typical HSP fashion, I thought about our interaction for a couple of weeks afterward, trying to figure out what I did wrong.\n\nThis conversation reinforced the perception that there\u2019s something \u201cunmanly\u201d about feeling too deeply, or trying to talk about those feelings. It\u2019s the same stigma that keeps many men from admitting they need help and getting treatment for mental health issues. Men die by suicide 3.5 times more often than women, according to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention.\n\nOur society generally does not recognize sensitivity as a strength for men. Don\u2019t let the romantic comedy talk about how desirable \u201csensitive\u201d guys are fool you. More than once, I\u2019ve been ridiculed by women for not taking charge in romantic situations, for being too attentive, even for just voicing an appreciation of beauty in everyday surroundings. I\u2019m painting with a broad brush here, but there\u2019s certainly a threshold for how sensitive men are allowed to be before it stops being desirable and even starts being irritating.\n\nBut I\u2019m also learning that sensitivity is what makes me an excellent listener, a considerate friend and thoughtful about things beyond myself. It allows me to notice subtle changes in people\u2019s behavior or mood, which improves the quality of my relationships, and it allows me to notice the most granular of details in my professional life. It\u2019s what gave me the wherewithal to eventually ask for help, to which I owe my life.\n\nI\u2019m not going to try to assert that I\u2019m completely comfortable with my place in the world as an HSP. I try as best I can to reframe sensitivity as my own little superpower \u2014 like heat or night vision \u2014 that allows me to perceive the world with heightened intensity. That I can see and feel things that other people cannot. It doesn\u2019t make me weak.\n\nI hope that one day I will know this to be true: There is nothing that makes a man more human, empathetic and courageous than embracing his feelings head-on, without shame.", "Gun control advocate Lucia \u201cLucy\u201d McBath won her race for Congress in Georgia\u2019s long-red 6th District on Thursday toppling GOP incumbent Karen Handel in an unexpected victory.\n\nOn Wednesday midday, McBath declared victory in the very tight race, reported the Atlanta Journal Constitution, though Handel didn\u2019t concede until Thursday morning.\n\nAfter carefully reviewing all of the election results, it is clear that I came up a bit short on Tuesday.

McBath\u2019s district, much like the rest of Georgia, has grown increasingly diverse in recent years, with more people of color, and likely Democrats, moving in.\n\nThe closely watched governor\u2019s race in Georgia remained too close to call on Thursday morning, with Democrat Stacey Abrams vying to become the nation\u2019s first black female governor, running against Republican Secretary of State Brian Kemp. Kemp faced accusations of voter suppression, which he denied.\n\nMcBath\u2019s race also may have reflected Americans\u2019 evolving views on gun control. She campaigned on a bold gun control platform in a state with gun-friendly laws in the heart of the Deep South, which has some of the nation\u2019s highest rates of gun ownership.\n\nMcBath, 58, was thrust into the national spotlight in 2012, when her black 17-year-old son, Jordan Davis, was shot dead at a Florida gas station by a white man complaining about loud music. The killer claimed he was justified under Florida\u2019s Stand Your Ground law, but a jury convicted him of first-degree murder.\n\nMcBath later became a spokesperson for gun safety group Moms Demand Action.

None of those things are true,\u201d Nse Ufot, executive director of the New Georgia Project, said of McBath\u2019s race last month.", "Warning: Spoilers for \u2018Suspiria\u2019 below!\n\nAbout halfway through the bewitching new horror redo \u201cSuspiria,\u201d a shocking image will char its way into your memory. It\u2019s not the dance academy matrons\u2019 spells illuminating walls, nor is it the hooks that pierce a transgressive student\u2019s possessed limbs. The image in question is even more electrifying than the finale\u2019s operatic bloodshed, in which women\u2019s entrails explode and a feeble old man writhes naked on the floor.\n\nI\u2019m talking, of course, about Tilda Swinton eating a chicken wing.\n\nSmack-dab in the center of Luca Guadagnino\u2019s 2.5-hour mood piece, amid the gray skies and grim Cold War politics, there she sits: the regal headmistress herself, Swinton\u2019s Madame Blanc, gnawing on a nub of poultry as if she hasn\u2019t been torpedoing underlings\u2019 lives left and right. It\u2019s the best kind of movie minutiae, a trivial detail so out of place it deserves a life of its own.\n\nThe chicken noshing occurs during a conversation with Blanc\u2019s star pupil, Susie Bannon (Dakota Johnson), who aced her audition at the prestigious Berlin school and is scaling the ranks to become the lead in a demanding production that evokes Holocaust brutalities. What Susie doesn\u2019t know \u2015 or does she? \u2015 is that the coven is priming her as a sacrificial lamb. Her true function is to imbue fresh life into Madame Markos, the academy\u2019s decrepit namesake.\n\nBefore that can happen, Blanc needs to lull Susie into submission; they must become entwined, psychically and physically. And so they break bread together, sitting opposite each other in a dim room deep inside the institution\u2019s bowels, where the ruling witches convene. It\u2019s Blanc\u2019s private residence, and she\u2019s wearing some sort of nightgown with tulips printed on it. (The original \u201cSuspiria\u201d lacked chicken wings, but it did feature Susie \u2015 or Suzy, as the character\u2019s name was spelled when portrayed by Jessica Harper \u2015 in a crucial t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate in Blanc\u2019s office.)\n\nAfter needling Susie over her pallor, Blanc asks about her cloistered Mennonite upbringing. Guadagnino first frames the pair via wide shot, a coffee table separating them. Susie delivers a brief history lesson, explaining that the Mennonites split from the Amish in the 17th century. When the scene cuts closer to them, we see napkins draped across their laps \u2015 a dinner date. Susie appears to be nibbling on shredded white meat, perhaps, but Blanc dares to eat a food item famous for its messiness: Yep, there\u2019s that chicken wing.\n\nAmazon Studios Dakota Johnson in \"Suspiria.\"\n\nThe way Swinton wields and bites the wing is fascinating. At first, she holds it in her outstretched arm, propped on the side of the couch where she is seated. Continuing Blanc\u2019s investigation into Susie\u2019s biography, Swinton waves the drumette as she speaks, the rest of her body remaining still.\n\n\u201cHow did your journey toward us begin?\u201d Blanc asks.\n\nAnd then, in closeup, Swinton munches on a chunk of chicken, yanking the bone from her mouth like any wing pro would. Were she a hair less dignified, you\u2019d expect her to set it down and lick her fingers clean.\n\nOf all the foods in the world, and of all the pivotal mentor-mentee meetings that include cuisine, I had to wonder: Why a chicken wing? Something about it seems so ... breezy tailgating fiesta? So ... ranch dressing? So ... Buffalo Wild Wings with a pint stationed nearby? So ... Joey Chestnut?\n\nYet it also feels subversive, like Blanc, despite all her imperiousness, is devouring something that announces itself more loudly than the words drifting from her mouth. She has the chutzpah to brandish a victual that threatens to drench her mouth in sauce, to make her unclean and less formidable. Thank goodness there\u2019s a napkin at arm\u2019s length, not that she puts it to much use.\n\nLonging to get to the bottom of this singular \u201cSuspiria\u201d moment, I emailed the movie\u2019s screenwriter, David Kajganich, who previously penned \u201cThe Invasion\u201d and Guadagnino\u2019s \u201cA Bigger Splash\u201d (the latter starring Swinton as a Bowie-inspired rock diva). Kajganich said he consulted Guadagnino and Swinton before answering my questions, though Swinton apparently hadn\u2019t replied to him as of this story\u2019s publication.\n\n\u201cIn the script, they were eating some kind of messy Japanese dish, as we\u2019d given Blanc a few fetishes \u2015 being a Japanophile was one of them, girls with brown eyes was another,\u201d Kajganich said. Wanting something less cumbersome but no less distinctive, Guadagnino opted to sub the Japanese entr\u00e9e with \u2015 you guessed it \u2015 chicken wings.\n\n\u201cLuca chose them,\u201d Kajganich said. \u201cI just emailed him to confirm that, and he said chicken wings were \u2018the perfect German food of 1977.\u2019\u201d\n\nAmazon Studios Luca Guadagnino directs a scene from \"Suspiria.\"\n\nWhoa. Who knew? Guadagnino and Kajganich didn\u2019t elaborate, but of course, I then realized, Blanc\u2019s wing may be messy, but it\u2019s not Buffalo messy. That would be far too American for a British sorceress running a Berlin Wall-adjacent company barely a decade after the pub-friendly dish was reportedly invented in upstate New York. (Speaking of 1977, though, the food\u2019s stateside popularity crystallized that year when the town of Buffalo declared July 29 to be Chicken Wing Day. \u201cSuspiria\u201d takes place that autumn.)\n\nAs for the wing\u2019s actual flavor, or any potential on-set discussions about how Swinton would consume it, we may never know, unless the actress responds to Kajganich\u2019s queries. (I\u2019ll update this story if I hear anything further.)\n\nOne thing \u201cSuspiria\u201d gets especially right: Blanc\u2019s wing is a social lubricant, almost as if it\u2019s a wand ready for incantations. Susie loosens up as their conversation continues, and when Blanc replaces her finished wing with a cigarette, the two really get down to business. That\u2019s when Blanc asks what dancing in the ensemble\u2019s \u201cprotagonist\u201d role was like for Susie.\n\n\u201cIt felt like what I think it must feel like to fuck,\u201d the repressed Ohio-born student says.\n\n\u201cDo you mean fuck a man?\u201d Blanc asks, seeming to anticipate her answer.\n\n\u201cNo, I was thinking of an animal,\u201d Susie counters.\n\nNow, could she utter something so bold had she not watched her teacher ingest a handheld chicken wing with abandon? Could Susie, in the end, have risen to her proper position as Mother Suspiriorum, giver of death and eraser of memories? I think not.", "\u201cOutlaw King\u201d is, in many ways, my absolute nightmare of a film. A medieval war epic about the rise of Scottish king Robert the Bruce? No, thank you. Fight scene after fight scene of costumed men flailing about battlefields stretching into eternity? Would rather not. A cross between \u201cBraveheart\u201d and \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d? Noooooooooooo.\n\nLife is too short to watch films you\u2019re bound to hate. So I didn\u2019t, for the most part. There is one aspect of the movie, which premieres Friday on Netflix, that managed to catch my attention. And that scene involved Chris Pine\u2019s dick.\n\nThat\u2019s right, Pine\u2019s bare naked schlong is on view for about one full second of the otherwise unrelieved film. I know this because I hit play only after fast-forwarding to the 1:27:52 mark, saw the Pine-is itself, and pressed stop promptly at 1:27:56.\n\nUpon realizing I\u2019d missed context necessary to fully understand the cock scene at hand, I rewound a bit. Dutiful critic that I am, I\u2019m proud to say I watched approximately 30 seconds of \u201cOutlaw King\u201d in total, enough to catch the moments that sandwiched Pine\u2019s wiener like a freshly baked bun. This is my very serious cinematic review of those seconds.\n\nLet\u2019s start at the beginning, around 1:27:31. Elizabeth de Burgh, played by Florence Pugh, is locked in an iron cage dangling above the ocean. I do not know how she got in this cage or why, but she seems very upset about the circumstances and wails miserably into the distance as sad, Scottish music plays on.\n\nAs a viewer, I had no idea what was happening. But as a critic, I couldn\u2019t help but notice that de Burgh\u2019s cage looked a lot like an erect dick. Truly, there\u2019s a head and then a shaft and she is trapped inside, a literal slave to the D. I don\u2019t know if this is exactly what director David Mackenzie was going for, but honestly, the symbolism is a little heavy-handed.\n\nNext scene: We\u2019re in a Scottish marsh. Bubbles are bubbling up to the water\u2019s edge, as bubbles do. All of a sudden, a man emerges from the sea\u2019s depths. (It\u2019s happening!) It\u2019s Hollywood leading man Chris Pine and his handy dong! Pine shoots out of the sea like a dolphin at Sea World, spewing water from his mouth like a walrus (also at Sea World).\n\nSadly, some of these droplets obscure the view of his physical form, which is already being shot from very far away. But onward I pressed.\n\nPine pants heavily, as if he\u2019s just challenged himself to an underwater endurance contest and needs a moment to recover. In the meantime, the camera pans out to reveal some of his Scottish buddies hanging out by the fire.\n\n\u201cI decided to come out in the open,\u201d Pine says, all too perfectly. And scene.\n\nIn reality, the words are probably the introduction to some grand battle scheme he\u2019s about to outline. But I prefer to imagine the line is Pine\u2019s way of breaking the fourth wall, introducing Richard and the twins to the world.\n\nSince \u201cOutlaw King\u201d premiered at TIFF in September, the internet has been abuzz about cinema\u2019s emerging member. \u201cChris Pine\u2019s Penis Dazzles Audience at Opening Night of the Toronto Film Festival,\u201d Vulture praised. Not long after, however, the Guardian\u2019s Jamie Dunne hit back: \u201cWhy the fuss over Chris Pine\u2019s \u2018dazzling\u2019 penis?\u201d condemning Vulture and other publications for their squeamish immaturity.\n\n\u201cIs this overreaction to a glimpse of Pine\u2019s penis the reason so many young actors are squeamish about getting naked for their art?\u201d Dunne asked. Umm, no. Critics are thrilled by Pine\u2019s peen because Hollywood wood is a relatively rare thing to observe, akin to a fleshy unicorn (minus the horse) in the wild.\n\nCase in point, while Pugh also appears nude in the film, her state of undress is basically expected.\n\nIf anything, all the hullabaloo over Pine\u2019s nudity makes more clear a double standard that women can only satirize at this point, because what else can we do??? Even a flash of dick, glimpsed from a distance, is enough to trigger the headline \u201cSome More Chris Pine Dick News.\u201d And I welcome that.\n\nBecause until men and women in Hollywood operate under the same set of standards governing nudity, I refuse to stand idly by and not say something about Chris Pine\u2019s dick. Just as Robert the Bruce didn\u2019t give up in doing whatever he did in the other parts of this movie I didn\u2019t watch, neither shall I, in my quest to bring more dicks to more screens. This is my oath.\n\nIn an interview with BBC Radio 1, Pine explained the motivation behind his nudity. \u201cUnderneath the emperor\u2019s clothes, he\u2019s a naked person,\u201d he said of the Bruce. \u201cI want to see the animal and I want to see the king.\u201d", "Sarah Silverman delivered a stern message to Democrats who may be failing to appreciate the success their party enjoyed in Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections.\n\n\u201cLook at the big picture here,\u201d Silverman said in a \u201cQuickie\u201d clip for her Hulu show \u201cI Love You, America\u201d shared online Wednesday. \u201cDemocrats are so defeatist, they can\u2019t even act like they won when they won.

We\u2019re talking breakouts, irritation and even allergic reactions.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean you need to abandon them altogether, but there are some things you should know when it comes to makeup wipes and their effectiveness.\n\nFor starters, they don\u2019t do the best job of cleaning the skin\n\nAs Archana Sangha, board-certified physician assistant at Anne Arundel Dermatology in Virginia, explained to HuffPost, makeup wipes can remove some of the grit and grime on your face, but they\u2019re not getting rid of all of it, since you\u2019re typically not rinsing your face after using them.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s that residue that\u2019s left on the skin still,\u201d she said. \u201cWipes have come a long way from even two years ago.\u201d However, she said, they shouldn\u2019t replace cleanser because they don\u2019t thoroughly clean your skin.\n\nSince wipes aren\u2019t totally effective at getting rid of excess oil, using them regularly could lead to clogged pores, which could lead to breakouts. In her experience, Sangha has noticed more acne breakouts in her patients that use face wipes exclusively to clean their skin.\n\nFace wipes can be helpful for some, she said, especially if your alternative is not cleaning your face at all. However, they don\u2019t compare to using a cleanser, massaging the skin, getting your circulation going and then rinsing the debris off your face. With a wipe, she said, you could just end up leaving half of the film on your face.\n\nBoard-certified dermatologist Dr. Craig Kraffert echoed Sangha\u2019s point. He explained that both facial wipes and rinse-off cleansers use solubilizers and emulsifiers to help \u201clift makeup, oil and scale from the skin.\u201d The main difference, he said, is that wipes are formulated to cleanse \u201cwithout the benefits that are inherent in being able to apply a product with water during the cleansing process.\u201d\n\n\u201cA wipe\u2019s limitation is that it requires the skin to be exposed to higher concentrations of cleansing ingredients, without the benefit of being able to rinse them away with water,\u201d he said. Rinsing is the part that actually removes dirt, oil and makeup from the face; if a wipe leaves residue on your skin, you can experience issues like dryness, sensitivity, irritation or allergic reactions.\n\nKraffert also noted that fibrous makeup wipes can be quite rough for some skin types and the act of rubbing them over the face could potentially damage the skin.\n\nmonzenmachi via Getty Images\n\nThen there\u2019s the film wipes leave behind\n\nWhile facial cleansing wipes claim to leave your skin, well, clean, they almost always leave some sort of film or residue behind.\n\nAs Sangha pointed out, many wipes advertise their moisturizing benefits. But if they\u2019re leaving a sticky or tacky film on your face, \u201cwhat that\u2019s doing is really just attracting germs to your face and acting like a slime, essentially, to attract pollutants to the face.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s leaving a residue, it\u2019s not great,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cMakeup wipes have certain inherent issues,\u201d Kraffert agreed. \u201cDue to the need to apply concentrated surfactants and emulsifiers for best results, they can be drying and irritating.\u201d\n\nWipes also contain a fairly high level of preservatives to help them maintain a long shelf life, Kraffert said, noting that those preservatives could potentially irritate the skin or even trigger an allergic reaction.\n\nKraffert cautioned against chemicals like 2-bromo-2-nitropropane-1,3-diol, which releases formaldehyde, a carcinogen and common allergen. Another preservative to look out for, he said, is iodopropynyl butylcarbamate, which \u201cshould not be inhaled.\u201d On the flip side, he said, phenoxyethanol is a \u201csafe and effective preservative.\u201d\n\nDr. Angela Lamb, director of the Westside Mount Sinai Dermatology Faculty Practice in New York, suggested staying away from wipes with extremely long ingredient lists. She specifically urged against using products containing cocamidopropyl betaine, a surfactant she said is \u201cknown to be irritating,\u201d or fragrances.\n\n\n\nCertain ingredients, namely things like aloe, panthenol and glycerin, can provide some benefit to those with sensitive or dry skin, as they\u2019re known to be soothing and moisturizing, Sangha added.\n\nNot all wipes are created equal\n\nAs is the case with many skin care products, different formulas work better on different skin types.\n\nAccording to Kraffert, those with oily and acne-prone skin \u201cgenerally do best with makeup wipes\u201d while \u201cdry skin types don\u2019t fare as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose with particularly sensitive skin should proceed with caution,\u201d he said. \u201cReactions to makeup wipes are sporadic but sensitive skin types are at greater risk of irritant reactions.\u201d\n\nIn Sangha\u2019s experience, some wipes might not be best for acne-prone individuals, as the film left behind could potentially clog pores and result in more breakouts. She and Lamb both recommended La Roche-Posay\u2019s Effaclar facial wipes, which contain micro-exfoliating beads to help unclog pores.\n\nFor folks who don\u2019t quite know what skin type they have or consider themselves part of the combination skin club, Sangha suggested Cetaphil Gentle Skin cleansing cloths, which are mild and hypoallergenic. Her go-to for those nights when you just can\u2019t be bothered to go to the sink to wash your face is the classic Neutrogena Makeup Remover cleansing towelettes.\n\nAt the end of the day, face wipes just don\u2019t compare to actually washing your face\n\nAll three dermatologists agreed that makeup remover wipes shouldn\u2019t be a replacement for washing your face, though they can be beneficial in certain situations.\n\n\u201cThe wipes are fine,\u201d Lamb said, \u201cbut they often leave a film on your face and are best when you are in a rush or to remove makeup before an actual wash. A gentle cleanser with a water rinse is best.\u201d\n\nKraffert agreed, saying that while makeup wipes are both quick and convenient, they\u2019re \u201cnot optimal for overall skin health.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are great for a quick cleanse when one is too tired to cleanse with water as well as in situations where rinse-off cleansing is difficult, such as when camping, exercising, traveling or in other transient environments,\u201d he said.\n\n", "The midterm elections are over. Women won historic gains in the House, which Democrats now appear to be on track to control.

Republican leaders have hinted they may look to cut Medicare and Social Security to make up the shortfall.\n\nWhat happens if fresh water becomes scarce, if there is widespread failure of agriculture and mass migration of climate refugees?\n\nMeanwhile, the poor and middle class are increasingly insecure: A minimum-wage job doesn\u2019t pay enough to rent a modest two-bedroom apartment in any U.S. state. Nearly half of Americans say they would struggle to cover an unexpected emergency expense of a few hundred dollars, and the insecurity and anger feed political extremism.\n\nAnd, most daunting of all, environmental collapse is proceeding much more quickly than scientists expected. As scary as the IPCC climate change report was (and it was a stark warning), the models used by this international commission don\u2019t account for the runaway effects of an ice-free ocean, of methane releases from melting permafrost and warmer oceans, and other ways in which global warming effects are beginning to build their own momentum. These runaway effects could make global heating irreversible.\n\nMany are now quietly talking about what happens if fresh water becomes scarce, if there is widespread failure of agriculture and mass migration of climate refugees \u2014 many are quietly talking about a collapse of human civilization. Some are even talking about human extinction.\n\nThe changes needed to tackle these crises are monumental. To even start to address them requires huge political will. In the U.S., neither party is remotely up to it. Both are too wedded to the status quo and to the flow of money from large corporate donors and the super wealthy.\n\nAt a recent talk I gave, a member of the audience admitted to despair and asked me where I found hope.\n\nI think we\u2019re screwed, I told him. I\u2019m done with hope.\n\nIf we hang on to the structures and mindsets of global corporate rule; the dominance of straight white men; and environmental destruction, and hope a few tweaks will right things, then hope is not helping.\n\nWe need much more foundational change, starting with placing a higher value on people\u2019s well-being and the well-being of all children for seven generations than on the accumulation of wealth for the few. Inclusion, instead of fear-mongering and divisiveness, must guide us. Stewarding, rather than exploiting, the natural world must define our ways of life.\n\nAnd to go deep enough with that shift, we need to begin where we live.\n\nOn my 12,000-mile road trip around the U.S. collecting stories for The Revolution Where You Live, I saw example after example of people making profound change.

Or, they\u2019re told to change themselves or what they buy, as though isolated individuals can change entrenched systems.\n\nThese approaches do little to build power or real change, and they make us feel powerless, and rightly so.\n\nBut when we act together, where we live, we can support each other and build power. We can start by electing truly forward-thinking representatives, but we can do much more to effect deep change. We can resist, reimagine the world we want, restore it, and build resilience.\n\nBegin small or large, but begin where you live, and you\u2019ll find you have far more power than you might have imagined.\n\nSince the election of 2016, resistance has been front and center. But many are also doing the deeply healing work of restoration \u2014 making right the wrongs that have been done to people and the planet. Likewise, many are building their own personal resilience so they can weather the shocks that come with rapidly changing times, while also weaving together stronger communities. And many are reimagining and building the world they want, beginning where they live.\n\nThis election was an important check on the power of the extremists who control the Republican Party, and we now have a group of promising new public leaders serving in Washington, D.C. and in state and local government around the country.\n\nSarah van Gelder Native American tribes from the west coast leave Bismarck, North Dakota, in September 2016, on their way to Standing Rock to oppose the Dakota Access Pipeline.

A limited number of voting machines created huge wait times at several Georgia polling sites.\n\nThe result has been predictable \u2015 systematic disenfranchisement of voters across the South and beyond, undoubtedly contributing to the defeat of Democratic gubernatorial candidates in Florida and Georgia (the latter is still being contested), and perhaps even enabling Ted Cruz in Texas to keep his Senate seat.\n\nNow that Democrats have reclaimed the House and key governor\u2019s mansions, and flipped hundreds of state legislative seats, we have a chance to do something about it.

He blithely assures America that the days of Jim Crow are over and that the \u201ccurrent conditions\u201d in no way resemble those of 1965. He writes that \u201cwhile any racial discrimination in voting is too much, Congress must ensure that the legislation it passes to remedy that problem speaks to current conditions.\u201d Because of that perceived mismatch, he claimed, he and his four colleagues took the \u201cgravest and most delicate duty\u201d of the Supreme Court and struck down a law as unconstitutional. He said that racism was still bad, of course, but that Congress would have to come up with some new rubric to protect the franchise of voters of color.\n\nCongress, or rather the Republicans who have maintained control of at least one chamber of Congress since 2013, has not developed a new rubric. Instead, Republican lawmakers and officials, especially those in the very states governed by the VRA, have touted the nonexistent threat of voter fraud in order to systematically re-disenfranchise voters of color through a variety of means.\n\nSome of their techniques are almost laughable, such as the preposterous claim to have \u201cforgotten\u201d power cords for the few voting machines sent to a precinct in Gwinnett County, Georgia. Others are dangerous, such as when Georgia police allegedly started harassing Democrats working to get out the vote. Mostly, though, the tactics are simple. Pass voter ID laws. Question every black registration. Close polling locations. Make the remaining locations remote, inaccessible, understaffed and under-equipped. Pour resources into voting sites in conservative districts. Reap the electoral rewards. These tactics have, regrettably, worked to ensure Republicans can continue their white minority rule.\n\nTHE ASSOCIATED PRESS In this Oct. 30 photo, rejected mail-in ballots sit in a box as members of the canvassing board verify signatures on ballots at the Miami-Dade County Elections Department in Florida.\n\nI wish we had transformed our voting system in 2009 after President Barack Obama took office, but there are many would-be priorities that slipped away during that brief window of total Democratic control.

Instead of seeking nefarious benefits, though, Democrats are in luck that the party does best when they do what\u2019s right. The more people receive their justly due franchise, in general, the more Democrats are elected. But Democrats should push for voting rights everywhere, rather than targeting potential strongholds, because the very nature of our democratic system of government depends on it.\n\nThe new House majority should draft clearly written (i.e., short) legislation that mandates automatic registration for all eligible voters and simple but radical measures like universal vote-by-mail. Then, Democrats should attach it to everything that comes out of the House, no matter how mundane.

You buy it when it\u2019s rock hard, thinking it\u2019ll certainly be ready to eat within a day or two. Six days later, your avocado stubbornly remains solid. Two days later, you check again, fingers fumbling over its rough green coat, prodding in anticipation. But still nothing. You sit back stumped. The avocado, at first laden with promise, has become a taunt. It gazes at you mockingly from its perch in the fruit bowl. Defeated, you toss it in the bin, the guilt of spending $3 on a single avocado coupled with the dark, deep shame of wasting food.\n\nBut fear not! There is a way to make Martha Stewart proud and tuck into your avocado toast like there\u2019s no tomorrow (after all, it is breakfast month).\n\nThe Science: How Avocados Ripen\n\nKantha Shelke, a food and nutrition scientist and member of the Institute of Food Technologists, explained the science behind the mysterious ripening process of avocados.\n\n\u201cThe fruit does not ripen while attached to the tree, even when physiologically mature, because of an inhibitor in the fruit stem,\u201d she told HuffPost. \u201cIt appears to be nature\u2019s way of protecting the fruit from damage from high temperatures. Even exposing the fruits on the tree to ethylene gas will not ripen it.\u201d (Ethylene is the hormone released by avocados \u2015 and other fruit and vegetables \u2015 as they ripen.)\n\nDigitaler Lumpensammler via Getty Images Avocados actually don't ripen while on the tree, even when it's physiologically mature. They only ripen once picked.\n\nHowever, once picked, it\u2019s a different story. Avocados must only be picked when mature so they have adequate oil content and dry matter. As they mature, their dry matter \u2015 which is made up mostly of carbohydrates \u2015 and oil content increase. This contributes to the creamy, soft texture we associate with avocados. Normal softening occurs only with a certain level of maturity in the fruit, which only develops after they have been picked from the tree. Fun fact: Softening begins at the round end of the fruit and then continues up to the stem end.\n\nAvocados picked before they are ready will never produce the oil content needed to make the fruits taste smooth when they\u2019re soft. Instead, they\u2019ll remain rubbery and will taste bland and watery.\n\nThere\u2019s even a law to prevent your avocado from being too hard.\n\n\u201cAccording to California law,\u201d Shelke said, \u201cavocados with less than 8 percent fat should never be picked for sale, because they will never soften.\u201d\n\nYou can shake an avocado to check if its seed rattles. If it does, that\u2019s a sign that the avocado is will ripen quickly (which is a good thing).\n\nAs for some of the old housewives\u2019 tips for ripening avocados, there is a method behind the madness.\n\n\u201cPlacing the avocado in a paper bag will trap the ethylene gas given off by the avocado, which in turn ripens it,\u201d explained Shelke. \u201cPlacing the avocado in a rice or flour bin will also do the trick, and adding a banana, apple or tomato in will increase the level of ethylene.\u201d\n\nProducers Are Using Technology And Planning To Help Us Out\n\nThe art of ripening avocados is such a delicate issue that companies are turning to technology to master the process. It\u2019s Fresh! is a U.K.-based company that has developed a filter to absorb ethylene and prevent avocados from getting too ripe too quickly.\n\n\u201cThere are many dark arts associated with ripening avocados,\u201d said Simon Lee, founder of It\u2019s Fresh! \u201cThere\u2019s no real secret formula.\u201d\n\nLee\u2019s technology comes in the form of a sheet that can be slotted into packaging and attracts and absorbs ethylene. However, the technology is not currently available for consumer purchase.\n\nA spokesperson from the California Avocado Commission said growers determine how ripe the fruit needs to be based on the order from the retailer. In turn, retailers decide at what stage they sell avocados based on demand from customers.\n\nWhat To Look For At The Store\n\nThe CAC suggested that shoppers should look for a classic pear shape and avoid avocados with loose skin or where the stem end is showing decay. If there are pockets or portions of the fruit that seem softer than the rest of the avocado, choose a different one. The pockets are likely bruises related to transportation or other avocado shoppers who have squeezed the fruit with their fingers (this avocado attack actually has a name: \u201cdigitizing.\u201d)\n\nBlemishes on the skin should generally be ignored, as they\u2019re grown in bundles surrounded by leaves, branches and tree limbs, and so can naturally have scuffs here and there.\n\nYou can also check the label to see where your avocado was grown, because that can indicate how quickly your fruit will ripen.\n\nAvocados grown in different areas of the world will ripen at varying paces. They are native to Guatemala, and varieties grown there and Mexico \u2015 tropical highland environments \u2015 tend to grow and mature slowly, but in the process, develop more dry matter and oil content. This means that they will ripen more quickly when they are detached from the tree.\n\nFruit exposed to high temperatures on the tree, in climates such as Israel and Arizona, produce significantly more dry matter and oil content, and therefore, ripen even more quickly.\n\nCalifornia Avocado Commission\n\nPerfectly ripening your avocado starts before you\u2019ve even taken it home. The secret is in the selection. The CAC defines avocado ripeness in five stages, as outlined in the graphic above.\n\nIf you want an avocado to eat two to three days from now, then select one in the third \u201cbreaking\u201d stage so it\u2019s ready to eat in time. If you are looking for one to eat that day, select a stage five.\n\nTricks That Actually Work\n\nAs mentioned above, putting an avocado in a paper bag, rice bin or other sealed container can help speed up the ripening process at home. Add fruit, but for best results use either Red Delicious or Golden Delicious apples, as the older varieties (as opposed to Gala or Fuji) produce more ethylene, according to the CAC.\n\nDespite rumors that heating an avocado will help ripen it, you shouldn\u2019t actually put the avocado in a microwave or other warm area. \u201cIt won\u2019t work,\u201d confirmed Francesco Brachetti, co-founder at Avocaderia, a New York-based avocado restaurant that claims to be the world\u2019s first avocado bar. \u201cYou could put it in an oven, turned off though, as the contained space would help contain the ethylene. But adding heat doesn\u2019t help.\u201d", "Sen.

Reilly (@ryanjreilly) November 7, 2018\n\nDemocrats were certainly not fans of Sessions, a hard-line opponent of illegal immigration who rolled back enforcement of civil rights laws and tossed out Obama-era sentencing reforms. But they see Sessions\u2019 ouster as yet another instance of Trump seeking to interfere with the Mueller probe, which has already resulted in the convictions of several Trump aides and the indictments of scores of Russian actors for their efforts to boost Trump\u2019s candidacy. And now, in the 116th U.S. Congress, they\u2019ll control the House gavels.\n\n\u201cThe firing of Jeff Sessions will be investigated and people will be held accountable,\u201d Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, said in a statement. \u201cThis must begin immediately, and if not, then a Democratic Congress will make this a priority in January.\u201d\n\n\u201cPresident Trump waited until just hours after the midterm elections to make this move, which had been rumored for months,\u201d said Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), the ranking member of the House Oversight Committee. \u201cCongress must now investigate the real reason for this termination, confirm that Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker is recused from all aspects of the Special Counsel\u2019s probe, and ensure that the Department of Justice safeguards the integrity of the Mueller investigation.\u201d\n\nDemocrats Question Whitaker\u2019s Role\n\nWhitaker, who was able to assume the acting attorney general position because Sessions resigned instead of being fired, has enjoyed a meteoric rise since he was hired as Sessions\u2019 chief of staff last year. After serving as a U.S. attorney in Iowa, Whitaker unsuccessfully ran for Senate and then became a commentator on CNN and ran a conservative ethics watchdog group called the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust. He\u2019s said that Rosenstein, who oversees the Russia probe and is now Whitaker\u2019s deputy, should\u2019ve ordered Mueller to \u201climit the scope of his investigation,\u201d and he warned that the special counsel was \u201cgoing too far\u201d and could be turning his investigation into \u201ca witch hunt.\u201d\n\nCummings and other Democrats have called on Whitaker to recuse himself from the Mueller probe, given his prior commentary on the investigation as well as his ties to Sam Clovis, a witness in the Mueller investigation. Whitaker, in a statement Wednesday night, said he was \u201ccommitted to leading a fair Department with the highest ethical standards.\u201d The Justice Department has not said whether he\u2019ll comply with the decision of career ethics officials who will examine whether there\u2019s a need for him to recuse himself.\n\nChip Somodevilla/Getty Images Matt Whitaker, now the acting attorney general, participates in an August roundtable event at the Department of Justice.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if Trump wants Whitaker to take on the position permanently or if he\u2019ll nominate a replacement. But, given what happened with Sessions, it seems unlikely Whitaker would agree to recuse himself from the Mueller probe.\n\nOversight Will Have To Wait A Few Months\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s unlikely that Republicans will agree to any form of oversight of the special counsel until Democrats take control of the House in January. When they do, it will mark a new era for the Trump administration, which hasn\u2019t faced any real congressional scrutiny since Trump took office in 2017. Republicans such as Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) have instead sought to protect the White House\u2019s interests and to undermine the special counsel investigation.\n\nWhen Democrats do take over Congress, one key document they\u2019ll be interested in is the final report on Mueller\u2019s investigation. Mueller is a by-the-books guy, and few expect him to break with Justice Department precedent and attempt to indict Trump. What\u2019s more likely is that Mueller\u2019s team will prepare a report outlining the evidence gathered about Trump, including the question of whether Trump\u2019s firing of former FBI Director James Comey or other attempts to intervene in the Mueller probe amounted to obstruction of justice.\n\nBut where that report ultimately ends up is unclear. There\u2019s no guarantee that Mueller and Rosenstein will send the report to Capitol Hill. Rudy Giuliani \u2015 Trump\u2019s attorney/television surrogate \u2015 has said they\u2019d attempt to block the release of any Mueller report, though experts have said it\u2019s unclear that the executive branch could actually claim privilege over the document. Whitaker, who has written about the ways a new attorney general could rein in the Mueller probe, could try to keep the document out of Congress\u2019 hands.\n\nSubpoena Enforcement Could Lead To Court Battles\n\n\n\nOverall, it\u2019s safe to expect more pressure on the Trump administration. It largely ignored requests from Democrats when they were in the House minority, but now the Democrats will have subpoena power. (One complicating factor: They have to rely upon the administration-controlled Justice Department to enforce such a subpoena.) There could be lengthy legal battles over which documents Congress is entitled to and which ones the Trump administration can keep secret. And the increased pressure from Capitol Hill will come at a time when a number of prominent legal roles in the administration are empty.", "The Trump administration had been accused of using the deployment of more than 7,000 troops at the U.S.-Mexico border as a political ploy.

Jamie Davis confirmed the name change with several news outlets, including CNN, Reuters and The Hill, though Davis told The Hill that the name, which evokes a full-scale military mission, had been in place for \u201ca couple of days.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are not calling it \u2018Operation Faithful Patriot,\u2019 we are calling it \u2018border support,\u2019\u201d Davis told CNN.\n\nDavis did not provide a reason for the name change, but Chris Sherwood, also a Pentagon spokesman, told The Washington Post that \u201cborder support\u201d more accurately described the deployment.\n\nThe Trump administration announced in late October that it was sending 5,200 more troops to the U.S.-Mexican border, doubling the number that were already there, in response to the migrant caravan approaching the U.S. in search of asylum.\n\nTrump highlighted the caravan in campaign rallies leading up to Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections, repeatedly mentioning his anti-immigration agenda and the massive military deployment.\n\nMeanwhile, groups accused the administration of using the troops as a political ploy to bolster Republicans ahead of the midterms.\n\nMattis rejected the accusation last week, noting that troops were being deployed to support the Department of Homeland Security and Customs and Border Protection.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t do stunts in this department,\u201d Mattis told reporters.", "Democrat Stacey Abrams is not conceding the race for Georgia governor until \u201cevery vote\u201d is counted, her campaign said late Wednesday after Republican Secretary of State Brian Kemp declared himself the victor in the tight race.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, Kemp\u2019s campaign released a statement declaring Kemp the victor, saying he \u201cwill now begin his transition as governor-elect of Georgia\u201d and claiming that it was \u201cmathematically impossible\u201d for Abrams to win or force a runoff.\n\nAbrams\u2019 campaign told reporters on a conference call later Wednesday that \u201cwe do not accept\u201d Kemp\u2019s declaration of victory, and the campaign demanded transparency from his office (as secretary of state, he oversees elections) on the thousands of votes not yet counted.\n\nAbrams was trailing Kemp by less than 63,000 votes as of Wednesday night, according to The New York Times.\n\nKemp\u2019s office had told Abrams\u2019 team there were 25,000 outstanding votes \u2015 22,000 provisional ballots and 3,000 mail-in or absentee ballots. If 23,800 of those votes were to be in Abrams\u2019 favor, it would force a recount, and 25,700 votes would force a runoff, her campaign said.\n\n\u201cThis declaration was not a credible declaration \u2015 full stop.

The secretary of state had refused to step down from his oversight role.\n\nAbrams has accused Kemp of voter suppression. Kemp has called such accusations a \u201cfarce.\u201d\n\nGeorgia \u201cpurged twice as many voters \u2014 1.5 million \u2014 between the 2012 and 2016 elections as it did between 2008 and 2012,\u201d according to the Brennan Center for Justice. Kemp took office in 2010.\n\nIn August, one majority-black Georgia county had to reject a plan to close nearly all of its polling places. And last month, a federal judge said she would block election officials from throwing out absentee ballots based on signature discrepancies after one county faced scrutiny for rejecting an unusually high number of mail-in ballots.\n\nOn Election Day, the state had to keep polling locations open late after multiple majority-black districts had technical difficulties with voting machines. Voters reported hours-long lines and other obstacles that some attributed to voter suppression efforts.\n\n\u201cOur mission is clear: to ensure that every vote is counted and that Georgians have the ability to have confidence in the election and its outcome,\u201d Groh-Wargo said.", "EL PASO, Texas \u2015 The question for many political observers as polls closed Tuesday in perhaps the nation\u2019s most closely watched Senate race was not whether rising Democratic star Beto O\u2019Rourke would lose, but by how much.\n\nThe answer, according to the unofficial final tally: not quite 2.7 percentage points.\n\nWhile throngs of his disappointed supporters mourn his loss to incumbent Republican Ted Cruz, the larger theme for the state\u2019s Democratic Party is not that Texas remains under conservative control, but that the margin by which Republicans won the Senate race and some other key contests was far narrower than anyone would have expected not so long ago.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Democrat Beto O'Rourke lost his quixotic bid to unseat GOP Sen. Ted Cruz in Texas. But O'Rourke's run left his party in a far better position to compete in the state down the road.\n\nAttorney General Ken Paxton won by 3.6 points; Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick triumphed by less than 5. These two incumbents won their races four years ago by margins of more than 20 points, and their opponents this time were hardly political juggernauts.\n\nAnd even as popular Gov. Greg Abbott cruised to re-election, his underfunded and uninspiring opponent, former Dallas County Sheriff Lupe Valdez, still winnowed the gap from Wendy Davis\u2019s 20-point obliteration in 2014 to a less atrocious 13.4-point spread.\n\nDemocrats also actually won two key races, ousting previously entrenched GOP incumbents in two U.S. House districts \u2015 one in the Houston area, the other part of the Dallas metroplex.\n\nNone of this is good news for Texas Republicans. Heading into 2020, the state is now far more competitive than it has been in at least a generation. And O\u2019Rourke, at the start of the year an obscure House member from El Paso, gets the credit.\n\n\u201cThe long-lasting impact that he will have is that more very high-quality (Democratic) candidates will choose to run and I think more Texans will believe that their votes will really count,\u201d Austin City Councilman Greg Casar told HuffPost. \u201cAnd now nationally, people really have to talk about Texas as a purple state.\u201d\n\nUnderlying reasons at work before O\u2019Rourke\u2019s emergence help explain the trend. State Democratic officials are quick to point out that their efforts to mobilize low-propensity voters began years ago. Nonprofit groups \u2015 including several nonpartisan ones \u2015 have also amped up that work in a state where turnout rates lag, especially among Hispanics.\n\nDemocrats made a point of contesting more congressional races this year, upping the stakes for voters. The Texas electorate is also becoming younger, more urban and more diverse. All of that favors Democrats.\n\nBut the catalyst was undoubtedly O\u2019Rourke.\n\n\u201cEssentially, there was a ... blue wave\u201d inspired by support for O\u2019Rourke and antipathy toward President Donald Trump, Rice University political scientist Mark Jones told HuffPost.\n\n\u201cBeto O\u2019Rourke, barring a miracle, was always going to lose,\u201d Jones added. \u201cThe question was, could he narrow the margin of defeat to a low enough number that he could create enthusiasm for Democrats looking to the future?\u201d\n\nAssociated Press Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton won by a landslide in 2014. On Tuesday, he held onto his seat by 3.6 percentage points.\n\nThat effect played out across the ballot. Along with the two House seats they flipped, Democrats nearly picked up a third \u2015 Rep. Will Hurd, a moderate Republican (and a good friend of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s), appears to have eked out a win by fewer than 1,200 votes. His challenger, Gina Ortiz Jones, has refused to concede until the absentee ballots are all counted.\n\nIn the state legislature, Republicans held onto strong majorities but lost two Senate seats and a dozen in the House. State Rep. Matt Rinaldi, who famously called Immigration and Customs Enforcement to report undocumented activists at the Capitol last year, was among the losers. It wasn\u2019t an isolated result. Some of the most polarizing movement conservatives either lost or saw their margins of victory decrease.\n\n\u201cThe biggest lesson is that Republican candidates who have a profile of being more reasonable and less polarizing did significantly better than candidates seen as less flexible and more polarizing,\u201d Jones said.\n\nWith the state\u2019s biennial legislative session set to start in January, that development will make it harder for hardline conservatives like Patrick to marshal an ideologically driven agenda \u2015 as he did last year when the lieutenant governor relentlessly pushing for transgender bathroom restrictions. (The measure ultimately failed.)\n\nBut the bigger takeaway is that the Texas Democratic Party officials already are much more confident as they look toward 2020. They\u2019ve already seen a flurry of interest in candidate recruitment for next cycle, according to party communications director Manny Garcia. They\u2019ll clearly target GOP Sen. John Cornyn\u2019s seat.\n\nThe impact of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s underdog campaign stretches beyond losing by fewer points. His aggressive ground game, anchored by his visits to each of the state\u2019s 254 counties, offered a new model for spurring enthusiasm. He leaves the state party with a healthier infrastructure and a battalion of volunteers who saw their work make an unlikely impact.\n\nAnd by coming within striking distance of defeating Cruz, lifting a lackluster statewide ticket in the process, O\u2019Rourke demonstrated to donors within the state and beyond that Texas Democrats are worth investing in.\n\nSome Democrats in tight races across the country grumbled ahead of Election Day that O\u2019Rourke didn\u2019t spread the more than $70 million in small donations that he amassed for what was all but sure to be a losing run. But prominent Texas Democrats have complained for years that the national party treats the state like an ATM, descending upon it to gather funds for candidates in swing states.\n\n\u201cOn Election Night in 2016, Democrats in San Antonio, Houston and Dallas were making phone calls to Iowa and Ohio\u201d to try t help the party in those states, Garcia said. \u201cI think what that (O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign) shows is that if we keep our volunteer capacity here, if Texans talk to Texans and Texas donors fund Texas candidates, we will win this state.\u201d\n\nOf course, what remains to be seen as Texas Democrats move forward is whether others can replicate O\u2019Rourke\u2019s success.\n\nAs a bilingual and bicultural border resident, he connected with Hispanic voters on health care, immigration and his support of veterans. Unencumbered by an internal pollster to moderate his commentary, O\u2019Rourke freely ad-libbed at his numerous town halls and campaign rallies \u2015 often going viral when taking on contentious cultural issues, most famously when defending National Football League players who take a knee during the national anthem to protest racial injustices.\n\nUnrelentingly optimistic in the face of polarization, O\u2019Rourke\u2019s greatest struggle was answering and leveling attacks against Cruz, a skilled debater and former solicitor general.\n\nThat combination of qualities is unusual. Dallas-based Democratic state Rep. Rafael Anchia compared O\u2019Rourke on the stump favorably to the likes of Bill Clinton and Barack Obama.", "Lauren Underwood\u2019s victory in Illinois\u2019 14th Congressional District is historic in many respects.\n\nThe 32-year-old registered nurse won the seat from a four-term Republican incumbent, Rep.

Even his own super PAC didn\u2019t fully take his advice. The Congressional Leadership Fund was one of the first branches of the GOP campaign arm to largely abandon the tax cuts and instead run on fear, racial anxiety and culture war issues, doing so in a \ufeffMarch special election in Pennsylvania\u2019s 18th Congressional District.\n\nThe failure to take that advice \u2015 to make the tax cuts popular and try to run on that popularity \u2015 may have sealed the GOP\u2019s fate. Although Republicans staved off Democrats in many districts that Donald Trump won in 2016, the GOP couldn\u2019t stop Democrats from flipping many of the districts Hillary Clinton took two years ago. A booming economy and bigger paychecks were supposed to help Republicans in these districts, often in upper-crust suburbs. Instead, that wasn\u2019t enough.\n\nNearly every Republican interviewed for this story agreed the party could have done a better job selling the tax cut law. But Democrats argue that the problem was the policy: Voters just didn\u2019t buy anymore that tax cuts for the wealthy trickle down to the middle class.\n\n\u201cYou might be able to sell New Coke,\u201d said Jesse Ferguson, a Democratic strategist who has helped marshal the anti-tax cut messaging. \u201cYou can\u2019t sell New Arsenic. The problem here wasn\u2019t the promotion. It was the policy.\u201d\n\nWhen the GOP rolled out the tax law, Democrats were worried. While projecting confidence, they started polling elements of the tax bill in October 2017. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and other groups found that if they didn\u2019t counter the GOP messaging, Republicans would win the fight. So Democrats tried to define the tax bill by emphasizing who was prioritized in the bill \u2014 mainly large corporations and the rich.\n\nVoters seemed to think the tax code changes were meant not for them but for businesses.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to remember: Tax cuts are supposed to be popular,\u201d DCCC communications director Meredith Kelly told HuffPost this week.\n\nThe most worrying period for Democrats came in January and February, when large corporations and businesses were seemingly announcing new bonuses for workers every day and crediting them to the tax bill. At one point, the legislation\u2019s approval rating hit 50 percent in a New York Times poll. And then the momentum stalled, in part because the bonuses dried up and the bill proved largely unhelpful to many people.\n\nThe legislation did put a little more money in most voters\u2019 hands. The average household in the middle 20 percent of incomes should be getting 1.3 percent more take-home pay because of lower rates this year, according to a March analysis by the independent Tax Policy Center. But the law cut taxes more substantially for wealthier individuals. Taxpayers in the 95th to 99th income percentiles will have 3.4 percent more income after taxes.\n\nThe law also slathered money on corporations. Contrast the temporary tax cut of a few percentage points for individuals with the permanent 40 percent tax cut for corporations. Voters seemed to think the tax code changes were meant not for them but for businesses.\n\nRepublicans claimed a drastically lower corporate tax rate would boost hiring and wages, and they pointed to a series of corporate bonus announcements as proof. When House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) described the bonuses as \u201ccrumbs\u201d relative to what corporations got, Republicans spent weeks highlighting her comment as wacky and out of touch.\n\nBut the bonuses really were crumbs compared with the wave of shareholder-enriching stock buybacks that the law inspired this year. Workers might not have even noticed the tiny tax cut in their paychecks next to other changes, such as different retirement withholdings and health insurance premium increases.\n\n\u201cThere was a nexus of Republicans, the Trump White House and big, wealthy corporations trying to sell this plan,\u201d Ferguson said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t delusional about what we were up against. But every time a CEO spoke about how great the plan was, it confirmed to voters that this was a plan for CEOs.\u201d\n\nThe DCCC also emphasized how important it was for Democrats to focus on how much more the rich were benefiting, rather than getting into an argument about how much money was going to individuals\u2019 pockets.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to make loud and clear to regular people that they were not put first,\u201d Kelly said.\n\nDespite strong economic growth \u2015 gross domestic product rose 3.5 percent in the third quarter relative to the previous year \u2015 wage growth has been weak. Adjusted for inflation, real earnings for most workers have risen by less than 1 percent annually in any given month this year. In the fourth quarter of 2006, which also saw 3.5 percent GDP growth, wages outpaced inflation by more than 2 percent each month, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.\n\nThe first real political test for the tax bill came during that special election in Pennsylvania early in 2018. Republicans had just passed their tax bill, and they were pushing their candidate there, Rick Saccone, to use the legislation against Democratic candidate Conor Lamb. But Lamb argued \u2015 in a heavily Republican district \u2015 that while he supported tax cuts generally, he didn\u2019t support a giveaway to corporations and the rich and he certainly didn\u2019t support increasing the deficit and potentially trimming Medicare and Social Security.\n\nLamb was able to tie the deficit-busting tax cuts to possible reductions for Medicare and Social Security, capitalizing on comments that House Speaker Paul Ryan (Wis.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) made about the need for entitlement reform.\n\nThe strategy worked. Saccone lost the race. And suddenly Republicans were a little more gun shy about running on tax cuts.\n\nAs lawmakers began campaigning in earnest this year, Republicans barely mentioned the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in their ads. Democrats, meanwhile, hired comedy writers to skewer the law.\n\nThe DCCC also said its messaging worked partly because Republicans had soured voters by trying to gut health care protections for people with pre-existing conditions.\n\n\u201cThat poisoned the well,\u201d DCCC national press secretary Tyler Law told HuffPost.\n\nKelly and Law said it would have been much harder for Democrats to neutralize the tax cut issue if Republicans had passed that law before trying to repeal Obamacare.\n\nJust under 12 percent of GOP TV ads mentioned the tax bill, out of 396,607 TV spots analyzed.\n\nOver the summer, the tax law faded from the national political consciousness. North Korea, Trump\u2019s press conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki and Trump\u2019s threats to fire Attorney General Jeff Sessions dominated the news. Democrats relentlessly focused on health care. The Republican position in crucial House districts deteriorated.\n\nAround Labor Day, the Club for Growth \u2015 a conservative group that pushed for the tax cuts \u2015 ran a poll of swing districts. It found a massive enthusiasm gap in Democrats\u2019 favor and tested ways to solve it.\n\n\u201cThe strongest of these was defending the tax cuts and making them permanent,\u201d pollsters Chris Wilson and Byron Allen of WPA Intelligence wrote in a memo summarizing their findings. \u201cDefending the tax cuts and making them permanent was both the strongest persuasive message in moving swing voters to vote for Republicans and the strongest message in creating additional interest in the election among Republican voters.\u201d\n\nThe group shared the data with Ryan and Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (Calif.), but nothing changed.\n\n\u201cThey completely ignored the data,\u201d said David McIntosh, the Club for Growth\u2019s president and an Indiana former congressman. \u201cIt was a classic failure of the establishment Republican Party to run on issues that were helpful to them.\u201d\n\nHe argued that Democrats were backing away from their opposition to the law, with fewer and fewer calling for outright repeal and some musing about making the tax cuts permanent for individuals. He said Republicans could have saved its members like Rep. Dave Brat, who lost a seat in suburban Richmond, Virginia, if they had focused more on the tax cuts.\n\nThe National Republican Campaign Committee and the Congressional Leadership Fund contest claims that they didn\u2019t run on the tax bill. NRCC communications director Matt Gorman told HuffPost that Republicans did campaign on an economic message, releasing a handful of ads a week before Election Day that mostly mentioned tax cuts and the economy. \u201cI also think it shouldn\u2019t preclude us from going into the candidates\u2019 background and digging into opposition research,\u201d he said.\n\nWhat he likely meant by that are nuggets like New York Democrat Antonio Delgado once being a rapper, Minnesota Democrat Dan Feehan being employed by a \u201c[George] Soros\u2013funded liberal outfit in D.C.\u201d and connecting Michigan Democrat Elissa Slotkin to Pelosi and rioting mobs because \u201cSlotkin is one of them,\u201d according to ads paid for by the NRCC.\n\nRepublicans may have talked about the tax bill and the strong economy, but it was far from the overwhelming message. According to data compiled by Kantar Media/CMAG for HuffPost in September, just under 12 percent of GOP TV ads mentioned the tax bill, out of 396,607 TV spots analyzed. And despite what Republicans claim, those numbers likely got worse during the final two months of the campaign, as Trump and the GOP focused on a ginned-up crisis centered on Central American asylum seekers walking toward the southwestern U.S. border, the so-called caravan.", "\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what, CNN should be ashamed of itself having you working for them ...

The phrase has also become part of the black American vernacular because of Islam\u2019s influence on hip-hop \u2015 working its way into rapper A$AP Ferg\u2019s \u201cPlain Jane,\u201d for example.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t bat an [eye] when Christians reference their faith in victory speeches, in moments of silence, or opening prayers,\u201d Hill said. \u201cIf we as Muslims are questioned for using phrases which are part of our daily life, then that speaks a lot to the climate anti-Muslim bigotry.\u201d\n\nHearing Omar open her acceptance speech by wishing blessings to her supporters and thanking God is \u201cno different than hearing other members of Congress or public figures thank God for their successes,\u201d Hoda Hawa, director of policy and advocacy at the Muslim Public Affairs Council, told HuffPost.\n\nKEREM YUCEL via Getty Images Supporters wait eagerly for the arrival of Ilhan Omar, newly elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, during her election night victory party.\n\nHawa said Omar\u2019s election ensures that diverse American communities are represented in Congress.\n\n\u201cHer presence is an inspiration for young American Muslims who seek to become more politically engaged,\u201d she told HuffPost.\n\nSlate reporter Aymann Ismail wrote in a post that he felt \u201ctransported\u201d after hearing Omar use the Islamic phrases.\n\n\u201cAs the child of Muslim immigrants myself, for years, every vote I cast for a national candidate felt mostly like a vote against whoever I thought was more likely to stoke hatred against Americans like me,\u201d Ismail wrote.", "5:58 p.m.: I tune in a few minutes before Fox News\u2019 election special starts, just as de facto White House spokeswoman Laura Ingraham is launching into her final pre-results prediction for the night. \u201cWhatever happens tonight, the mainstream, lamestream media will conclude that it is a total repudiation of Trump\u2019s policies,\u201d she says.\n\nGreg Gutfeld, who does a slightly older version of Jesse Watters\u2019 every-white-guy schtick, is leaning so far back in his seat that I worry for a second that he might tip over. This man just does not care! When asked for his own final pre-results thoughts, Gutfeld announces that he is about to go get a drink. Watters forces out a laugh. Oh, Greg!\n\nFox News Greg Gutfeld leans back on the far right.\n\n6:05 p.m.: Honestly, nice set. Good-looking chairs, lots of red, white and blue. Wolf Blitzer, eat your heart out. The core group isn\u2019t the worst Fox News has on offer. The relatively straightforward duo of Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum appears to be at the helm tonight with Chris Wallace and Brit Hume offering insight on either side. Kind of a Republican Party circa 2004 feel going on? Should I be cautiously optimistic this won\u2019t devolve into a night of coded talk of \u201cAmerica\u2019s changing demographics\u201d? Because I am not cautiously optimistic.\n\n6:15 p.m.: Chris Wallace points out that if Republican Andy Barr wins his race in Kentucky\u2019s 6th Congressional District, the \u201cred wall gets a little redder,\u201d while if Democrat Amy McGrath wins, \u201cthe wave gets a little bluer.\u201d Primary colors. Rudimentary metaphors. This is the kind of cable news analysis I crave.\n\n6:22 p.m. Bill Hemmer is at one of those interactive screens, and he is noting that tonight they will be closely watching the race between Republican Denver Riggleman and Democrat Leslie Cockburn in Virginia\u2019s 5th Congressional District. Donald Trump endorsed Riggleman and won the district by 11 points in 2016, which naturally leads to two questions and two questions only: \u201cIs he still that popular again this year? Or has he increased his popularity?\u201d\n\nFox News Bill Hemmer explains the stakes in Virginia\u2019s 5th Congressional District.\n\n6:26 p.m.: Harris Faulkner is introducing something called the \u201cKey House Race Tracker.\u201d As far as I understand it, the Key House Race Tracker helps you track key House races, but in a way that makes it feel like sports! Who doesn\u2019t like sports. Not Faulkner, and I know that because she just said, \u201cWe love the NFL on Fox, you know that\u201d while describing a yellow line in the middle as a \u201cyard line.\u201d\n\nShe adds that you can look at what\u2019s near that middle line and understand which races are closest.\n\n\u201cMy husband loves that. I don\u2019t even have to speak and he knows the score of the game,\u201d she cracks.\n\n.@HARRISFAULKNER has a look at the key House races as the polls begin to close on #ElectionDay. https://t.co/tH1ocNmSM1 pic.twitter.com/3ZsFx3a9Rb \u2014 Fox News (@FoxNews) November 7, 2018\n\n6:34 p.m.: OK, we\u2019re suddenly cutting to \u201cFox & Friends\u201d host Steve Doocy, who is at a bar in Missouri where he is ready to talk to some regular beer-loving Americans. \u201cAmerica needs a drink,\u201d Doocy laughs. Haha, definitely! The only problem is the bar is not very full at all. Of the three women Doocy interviews, two are voting for incumbent Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill. This woman, however, did not vote for McCaskill:\n\nFox News Steve Doocy interviews a MAGA fan at a bar.\n\n6:42 p.m.: Laura Ingraham, Juan Williams, Dana Perino and Marie Harf are on stage now. Honestly, not minding the conversation among the latter three. But I\u2019m having trouble following Ingraham, who is explaining that there are two camps in this country: \u201cone that feels really battered and abused by the mainstream media\u201d and another made up of people who want \u201cpayback\u201d and to \u201csend a message: that even though the economy might be doing well, we don\u2019t like the way we feel.\u201d\n\n6:54 p.m.: Oh, hell yeah. Let\u2019s hear from some men on the street. Chad from South Carolina is worried about \u201copen borders,\u201d and Tom\u2019s main issue is \u201cthe polls have been wrong all along and people are not getting the facts out.\u201d Then the camera turns down and we meet Phoenix from Texas, a young and intrepid \u201ckid reporter\u201d with a great hat who believes Beto O\u2019Rourke is too left for his state. The Fox News interviewer responds: \u201cI\u2019ve got two words for you: You\u2019re hired.\u201d Everyone laughs.\n\n7:12 p.m.: Brit Hume is trying to help viewers understand how it could possibly be that Trump\u2019s tax bill is unpopular with Americans when the economy is great. The answer, he says, is not that the tax bill didn\u2019t work as promised but that Republicans didn\u2019t sell the it well. \u201cIt is a trap that Republicans fall into every time,\u201d he says, before adding: \u201cThe rich didn\u2019t do well in this tax cut. It was very much a middle-class tax cut.\u201d Is that true? Who knows.\n\n7:15 p.m.: OK, wow. It\u2019s starting to get much more Fox Newsy up in here. There is suddenly a sense of nervousness in the studio, and Ingraham just took control of the conversation to say that \u201cthe Democrats are better at the emotional anecdote, tugging at your heartstrings \u2015 the kid who can\u2019t get his procedure covered by insurance.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is very emotional, and people like emotion, it is good,\u201d Ingraham explains.\n\nEmotion, it is good.\n\n7:24 p.m.: Bret Baier is now interviewing former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell. The conversation seems fairly civil until Rendell suddenly says Trump \u201cshouldn\u2019t be talking about a made-up caravan,\u201d adding, \u201cNobody with half a brain \u2015\u201d before Baier cuts him off so quickly that for a second I thought Rendell had dropped an f-bomb. \u201cThere is actually a caravan,\u201d Baier exclaims.\n\n\u201cBut [it\u2019s] only an issue in President Trump\u2019s mind,\u201d Rendell replies. \u201cThese people are not trying to get into the country illegally. They\u2019re seeking asylum.\u201d\n\nThe guest appears to be making dangerous amounts of sense, and Baier changes the topic, asking Rendell if he thinks Democrats should investigate the president if they take over the House of Representatives or focus on legislation.\n\n7:33 p.m.: Interesting poll out of Georgia. Appears voter suppression was not an issue! Everybody move on.\n\nFox News Just a poll. No context needed.\n\n7:39 p.m.: Steve Hilton, who was once an adviser to former British Prime Minister David Cameron, is saying that this election is going to turn into \u201cstyle versus substance.\u201d Unsurprisingly, it appears the Democrats are the \u201cstyle\u201d in this metaphor. Hilton is arguing that, unlike regular Americans, wealthy Democrats don\u2019t have to worry about money, so they can focus on the president\u2019s personality \u2015 \u201cwhat he says, how he behaves,\u201d etc.\n\n\u201cI have a feeling what we are going to see is the Revenge of the Elites,\u201d he predicts.\n\n8:02 p.m.: Within seconds of calling the Illinois gubernatorial race for Democrat J.B. Pritzker, Martha MacCallum notes that he will become \u201cthe richest governor, actually, in U.S. history.\u201d Question: Why is it that when a Democrat is rich, he\u2019s an \u201celite,\u201d but when a Republican is rich, he\u2019s \u201csuccessful\u201d? The correct answer is: Who cares. It\u2019s time for class war.\n\n8:07 p.m: Things are looking good for the Dems, and Fox News is bringing in the big boy, Tucker Carlson, for some expert analysis. It seems as if Andrew Gillum might eke out a victory in Florida, and Tucker, like you, wants to know how exactly this atrocity could have come to pass. Sure, he\u2019ll now admit, Ron DeSantis kind of sucks. But what else? \u201cImmigration has changed Florida in a very recognizable way,\u201d he says. \u201cThe California of 30 years ago was solidly Republican. So was Florida. They now have different people in them.\u201d What kind of people could he be talking about? I have no idea.\n\n\n\nHe also notes that \u2015 wait, could this be? He\u2019s pointing out that the \u201chard left\u201d politics of Gillum might be more popular than previously assumed, since a lot of young people are living with their parents, etc. Of course, as we all know, universal health care is a \u201cludicrous\u201d idea, he says, adding: \u201cThere\u2019s no way to pay for that.\u201d\n\nBut, he continues:\n\nMaybe the hard-left economic issues are a little bit more popular than we want to think they are. I think that\u2019s ominous. But that doesn\u2019t make it any less true. Beto O\u2019Rourke, for example, I think will probably lose tonight, but he\u2019s coming a lot closer than he should in the state of Texas. Again two causes: Immigration has changed the demographics in Texas, and two, some of this populist economic stuff is more popular, again, than we want to think it is.\n\nThis has to be the closest we\u2019ll get to a Fox News panic button.\n\n8:14 p.m.: \u201cI disagree with much of what he says, but I think he\u2019s a very attractive guy,\u201d Brit Hume says of Andrew Gillum.\n\n8:39 p.m.: Just as I find myself getting bored, Laura Ingraham wakes me back up. This time she\u2019s mad about the rich Democratic elites \u2015 ActBlue and Tom Steyer (not George Soros this time; who knows why). These elites threw \u201cmillions\u201d into the Florida gubernatorial race, and we can all agree, again, that DeSantis kind of sucks. So should that loser win, Ingraham argues, \u201cI gotta say it\u2019s all Donald Trump who won this for him.\u201d\n\n9:00 p.m.: POLLS CLOSED IN 14 MORE STATES! BASED ON THE GRAPHICS THIS IS VERY EXCITING NEWS! I AM GETTING TIRED!!!\n\n9:09 p.m.: \u201cDon\u2019t discount the power of Rick Scott\u201d is a sentence I never thought I\u2019d hear, but hear it I did, just now, courtesy of Laura Ingraham. She is talking about Florida, and now that Gillum appears to be fading, he is suddenly too \u201cfar left\u201d for Florida, even though he almost won. Seems a little confusing, but she\u2019s the expert, not me.\n\n9:17 p.m.: Well, helloooo, former White House Deputy Chief of Staff Karl Rove, who is very excited to talk about Republican Mike Braun winning a Senate seat in Indiana. It appears this is the main victory we are excited about tonight.\n\nCheck out the excitement:\n\nFox News Oh, look, it's Karl Rove!\n\nBetween Hume and Rove, you could make an entire \u201cMcLaughlin Group\u201d panel out of all the jowl on set tonight.\n\n9:25 p.m.: Whoa, celeb sighting. White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders is joining us from just outside the White House, and she wants to let everyone watching Fox News to know that the president\u2019s actually had \u201can incredible night.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re seeing Americans come out and unanimously say that they are proud of this president and proud of what he\u2019s done in these two years,\u201d she says.\n\nThis is welcome insight, since the needle at the bottom right of the screen currently gives the Democrats an 84 percent chance of taking back the House of Representatives.\n\n9:33 p.m.: Whoops, sorry, Sarah: Fox News has just called the House for the Democrats, and Chris Wallace is guessing that a lot of people\u2019s heads are \u201cexploding\u201d at this exact moment, which is maybe the fairest and most balanced analysis I\u2019ve heard tonight.\n\nFox News That feeling when you've just called the House of Representatives for the Democrats.\n\n9:44 p.m.: We\u2019re back with Steve Doocy at the bar, which is now incredibly full with what I can only assume is a representative sample of the Missouri electorate, considering this tweet is the reason most of them are there:\n\nHey Springfield, Missouri! We are going LIVE from Patton Alley Pub in Springfield, stop by and talk to us starting at 5pm Central! \ud83c\udf7a #mosen #midterms2018 \u2014 Steve Doocy (@SteveDoocy) November 6, 2018\n\nDoocy starts to poll the entire audience. Who here voted for Claire McCaskill? A few people clap in the back. How about Josh Hawley? Raucous applause. Who here cares about health care? Near silence. The economy? Raucous applause. Kavanaugh? Raucous applause. How about the CARAVAN!? A few uncomfortable claps.\n\n9:53 p.m.: My girlfriend looks tired and a little depressed, so I switch the TV to CNN for a few minutes.\n\n9:56 p.m.: OK, she\u2019s asleep now, so I switch back, and Mike Braun is giving his victory speech. Yes, he is the star of the night, or at least the hour.\n\n10:04 p.m.: Laura Ingraham, the woman gets your attention. I was kind of losing interest and then she threw out the words \u201cthe constant demonization of the president as racist, as Hitler, as anti-Semitic and everything you can think of.\u201d I\u2019m not sure why exactly she said that, but I know I\u2019m now listening, and we\u2019re talking about Florida and Georgia. Ingraham proclaims that if both states go Republican, \u201cOprah, Obama, the entire mainstream media have a huge amount of egg on their face.\u201d\n\n10:11 p.m.: Hold on, we have ourselves an old-school cable news showdown! Laura Ingraham says that Trump has been unfairly portrayed as a \u201ccombination of Stalin, Hitler and every tyrant that ever lived.\u201d Juan Williams is saying that \u201cif the media was fair, they would call Trump out on his lies.\u201d Ingraham appears mildly annoyed!!!\n\nFox News Just two friends having a civil discussion about the country they love.\n\n10:15 p.m. Mike Braun, crown jewel, is now being interviewed. What are the things that really rile him up? \u201cBalancing our budget\u201d and \u201cfiscal integrity.\u201d Hell yeah.\n\n10:22 p.m.: After a few minutes of everyone pumping Donald Trump up, Chris Wallace works the brakes. \u201cWe are overstating a little bit the importance, not the importance, but giving too much credit to Donald Trump for holding on to the Senate. The fact is, this is a historically difficult year for the Democrats.\u201d Are we sure Wallace gets invited to his co-workers\u2019 birthday parties?\n\n10:25 p.m.: It appears hard-left-communist-agitator-slash-Democrat Beto O\u2019Rourke has lost, and Karl Rove is suddenly explaining why with jowly condescension. \u201cIf he had understood he is running in a red state he might\u2019ve had a better shot,\u201d Rove says, adding that O\u2019Rourke must have been an idiot to take radical positions like supporting the right of NFL players to peacefully protest.\n\n\u201cHe systematically alienated any shot he had at getting any moderate, independent vote,\u201d Rove says, \u201cunless they just really didn\u2019t like Ted Cruz at all.\u201d\n\n10:28 p.m.: Just realized it\u2019s the 10 o\u2019clock hour, which makes this Ingraham prime time, and I realize that because Ingraham is currently in possession of her second showdown of the last 30 minutes, this time with Chris Wallace. Ingraham is saying Cruz probably won because Trump went down there and that Donald Trump Jr. had a big effect on the midterms. That kind of stuff. \u201cThe party is coming home to Trump. The party is unified,\u201d says the news anchor. Meanwhile, she argues, the Democrats are having an Ocasio-Cortez party. Get it? They are socialists now.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s fair to say about the Democrats. That\u2019s a complete mischaracterization,\u201d argues Chris Wallace.\n\nShe seems to start to interrupt him. He says, \u201cLaura\u2026\u201d She says, \u201cChris\u2026\u201d They keep it cool enough, but you can tell. You can always tell.\n\n10:35 p.m.: The situation had looked a little dire for Republicans an hour or so ago, but things are picking up for them now. Coincidentally, the mood of the room at Fox News has improved. Republican Lindsey Graham is videoing in to explain why Republicans \u201cwon.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe reasons we won is I think Kavanaugh united our party, the caravan was an affront to our sovereignty, the economy was good and President Trump worked his butt off to get out the Republican base vote,\u201d he says.\n\nThen, like Lynyrd Skynyrd finishing off a set with \u201cFree Bird,\u201d Graham returns to Kavanaugh. Thanks to an assist from Bret Baier, he calls the Kavanaugh confirmation hearing \u201cdespicable\u201d and \u201ca Democratic debacle.\u201d \u201cThis was a good man that had his life ruined,\u201d says Graham of a man who was confirmed to a lifetime appointment on the U.S. Supreme Court literally last month.\n\n11:07 p.m.: Brit Hume is discussing the handsome 38-year-old Republican Josh Hawley\u2019s defeat of Claire McCaskill in Missouri. \u201cJosh Hawley emerges as a star on the national scene,\u201d he says. \u201cI wonder if he will get more publicity than Beto O\u2019Rourke now that he won and O\u2019Rourke lost. I kind of doubt it,\u201d he says before launching into something that I suppose technically could be described as a laugh.\n\n11:11 p.m.: For at least the second time tonight, someone on Fox News has implied the caravan is a manufactured controversy meant to drum up Republican anger. Last time it was Ed Rendell; this time it was Juan Williams. And just like last time, Bret Baier has jumped in like an umpire to let the world know that the caravan is real. \u201cThe caravan is real,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is there.\u201d\n\nWilliams begins to explain that Trump has depicted the caravan of migrants as \u201cgang members about to force their way through our borders\u201d before the conversation turns to whether the House Democrats will \u201cinvestigate or legislate.\u201d\n\n11:16 p.m.: Juan Williams and Brit Hume seem to be fighting, but honestly I\u2019m too tired to even try and deduce what it is they are fighting about. Something about Trump. You can assume.\n\n11:41 p.m.: I just realized I fell asleep for 25 minutes. Right after I wake up, Bret Baier pulls out a line about \u201cinvestigation after investigation,\u201d and I wish I hadn\u2019t.\n\n11:44 p.m.: We cut to a Josh Hawley victory speech, then a Rick Scott victory speech, then a Ron DeSantis victory speech. It appears that the Republicans have saved the country, buoyed by Donald Trump against the various attempts by the Democratic Party to sink our once-great nation.", "Tap here to turn on desktop notifications to get the news sent straight to you.", "The New York State Senate finally has some Asian-American representation.\n\nDemocrat John Liu, who was born in Taiwan, won the District 11 state Senate seat on Tuesday, defeating three other challengers.

Liu (@LiuNewYork) November 7, 2018\n\nLiu, who immigrated to the U.S. when he was 5 years old and grew up in Flushing, Queens, is no stranger to making history. Back in 2010, the Taiwanese-American was sworn in as New York City\u2019s comptroller, making him the first Asian-American to occupy that role. Previously, he served as a city councilman, making him the first Asian-American to be elected to a citywide office.\n\n\u201cJohn Liu is a model for new immigrants,\u201d John Park, president of the Korean American Community Empowerment Council said of Liu\u2019s victory as comptroller at the time. \u201cThis is a new era.\u201d\n\nWhile Liu had made a bid for the mayoral seat, his campaign became the subject of scandal in 2013 when a federal investigation was launched into his fundraising. Liu was never charged, but his campaign treasurer Jenny Hou and a fundraiser Oliver Pan were convicted on formal wire fraud charges related to illegal donations.\n\nThough Liu had lost the state senate seat to incumbent Tony Avella (D) back in 2014, he prevailed against the same challenger this time around.\n\nThomas is best known for his work as an attorney. He was appointed to the New York State Advisory Committee to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights back in 2016. Previously, Thomas had run for a congressional seat in New York\u2019s 2nd District, but withdrew prior to the June primary.\n\n\u201cI left the Congressional race because I can protect more New Yorkers in the state Senate and the Democratic Party has endorsed me as their nominee,\u201d he told U.S.-based Indian newspaper India-West.\n\nThe state senator-elect told HuffPost explained that he felt compelled to run for state senate because of his experience defending student loan borrowers.\n\n\u201cWhen I saw what the Trump administration did to consumer protection, I knew I had to do something,\u201d he said. \u201cI ran for office as my form of resistance. To do what I have always done, stand up for the little guy, to do what is right. As an Asian-American, that is just who we are and those are the values my parents raised me with.\u201d\n\nAnd because his district on Long Island has the fastest growing South Asian community in the state, he said he\u2019s aiming to highlight the struggles that disproportionately impact Asian-Americans.\n\n\u201cI ran to represent everyone in my district and that is what I intend to do. But ... I will certainly be bringing the issues of the Asian-American community to the state legislature,\u201d Thomas said.\n\nAsian-Americans have been stereotyped as apolitical; however the group has been up against several challenges that impede their civic engagement. Language barriers constitute a large part of the problem. Roughly one-third have limited English proficiency, and many Asian immigrants lean on their children to translate the voting process for them.\n\nMoreover, both Democrats and Republicans have failed to truly reach out to Asian-Americans.

In 3 days we get to watch Kate McKinnon play Jeff Sessions. \u2014 Kurt Andersen (@KBAndersen) November 7, 2018", "Candidates emerged victorious in dozens of pivotal races this week after running on platforms that included support for gun safety measures, and gun violence prevention groups are hailing those successes as a validation of their unprecedented election efforts, which included hundreds of endorsements and tens of millions of dollars in total campaign spending.\n\nThe issue of firearms was expected to play a role in the 2018 midterms, but it was unclear how important it would be. Although the gun safety movement has been growing steadily since the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, the massacre this February at a high school in Parkland, Florida, gave a surge of momentum to the cause. A new generation of young leaders emerged out of that tragedy, and current and former students crisscrossed the nation ahead of the election to register and mobilize voters around gun violence prevention.\n\nWith polls showing that gun policy was an important issue for many Democratic voters on Election Day \u2015 and with gun safety groups actually outspending the National Rifle Association\u2019s lagging political expenditures \u2015 advocates got an early start on their big night.\n\nIn the NRA\u2019s home state of Virginia, Sen. Tim Kaine (D) handily defeated GOP nominee Corey Stewart, an NRA-backed county board supervisor and staunch defender of Confederate symbols and monuments. A short time later, Rep. Barbara Comstock (R) \u2015 widely regarded as an NRA darling \u2015 fell to Democratic challenger Jennifer Wexton in a battle for Virginia\u2019s 10th congressional district, which houses NRA\u2019s headquarters. Also in Virginia, Democrats Elaine Luria and Abigail Spanberger would go on to defeat GOP incumbents in their U.S. House races.\n\nBloomberg via Getty Images Democrat Jennifer Wexton on Tuesday defeated incumbent Rep. Barbara Comstock (R) in Virginia's 10th congressional district. Wexton had the support of national gun violence prevention groups eager to take down Comstock, who was regarded as a darling of the NRA.\n\nKaine, Wexton, Luria and Spanberger all carried endorsements from leading gun safety groups, including the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, Everytown for Gun Safety and the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.\n\nThose organizations also backed Democrat Jason Crow, a U.S. Army Ranger veteran who toppled Rep. Mike Coffman (R) in Colorado. Crow supports a ban on assault-style rifles, and in January, he\u2019ll be sworn in to represent a district that includes Aurora, the site of the deadly 2012 mass shooting at a movie theater. The gunman there was equipped with a semiautomatic AR-15 rifle and high-capacity ammunition magazines, among other weapons.\n\nIn Texas, Democrats Colin Allred, Lizzie Pannill Fletcher and Veronica Escobar all won their U.S. House races with the help of gun safety groups. Allred defeated incumbent Rep. Pete Sessions (R), who had been a top recipient of NRA money over the course of his career. Gun safety advocates also claimed key House victories in other states, including California, Kansas, Minnesota, New Jersey and New York.\n\nOn Thursday, Democrat Lucy McBath won her House contest in Georgia, defeating a Republican incumbent in a traditional GOP stronghold. Gun reform was a major campaign issue for McBath, who became a prominent figure in the movement after her son, Jordan Davis, was fatally shot in 2012 by a white man complaining about him playing loud music in his car. With some races still too close to call at the time of publish, other advocates could still pick up more seats.\n\nBrady, Everytown and Giffords also backed winners in U.S. Senate competitions. Democrat Jacky Rosen knocked out incumbent Sen. Dean Heller (R) in Nevada, and Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) fended off a challenge from Republican Leah Vukmir, who carried an A-plus rating from the NRA.\n\nGun safety advocates triumphed in gubernatorial races as well, with Democrat Adam Sisolak winning in Nevada, Democrat Tim Walz securing victory in Minnesota and Democrat Gretchen Whitmer defeating Bill Schuette in Michigan. The NRA had endorsed all three Republicans in those races.\n\nThe cause of gun violence prevention also proved to be popular on the ballot, as voters in Washington state passed a measure to raise the legal age to buy semiautomatic rifles to 21, while also implementing enhanced background check, training and waiting period requirements for those firearms.\n\n\u201cLawmakers will have to start proving that they\u2019re acting to stop gun violence in order to keep their jobs.\u201d Shannon Watts, Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America\n\nBut Election Day didn\u2019t pass without disappointment for the gun reform movement. In Florida, young activists watched as Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum fell to NRA-backed Republican Ron DeSantis. Advocates could suffer another setback in the state\u2019s U.S. Senate race, though the tight contest between Sen. Bill Nelson (D) and Republican Rick Scott appears headed for a recount. And with the NRA endorsing candidates in hundreds of safer competitions across the nation, plenty of reliable pro-gun allies will be headed to Congress or governorships next year.\n\nStill, to gun violence prevention advocates, Tuesday\u2019s results served as a clear sign that the intensity gap on gun policy has closed, and that the longstanding NRA stranglehold on the issue has been broken.\n\n\u201cAmericans voting with gun violence in mind are voting for gun safety and against the NRA,\u201d said Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, an arm of Everytown, in a call with reporters on Tuesday.\n\nVoters have grown tired of politicians offering the empty rhetoric of \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d after national shooting tragedies, Watts added.\n\n\u201cLawmakers will have to start proving that they\u2019re acting to stop gun violence in order to keep their jobs,\u201d she said.\n\nWith a Democratic-controlled House and new proponents of gun safety in Congress, Brady Campaign co-president Avery Gardiner expressed optimism that lawmakers would finally take action on key gun safety priorities.\n\n\u201cExpanded background checks, banning weapons of war, passing nationwide extreme risk protection orders \u2015 at long last, all of these important measures will see a vote from a Congress committed to keeping Americans safe,\u201d Gardiner said in a statement.\n\nAlthough the midterm elections mark a significant achievement for these advocacy groups, the work of stopping gun violence has only just begun, said former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.), who founded the Giffords Law Center after surviving a near-fatal shooting in 2011.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re fighting to save lives, the stakes are simply too high to walk away,\u201d Giffords said in a statement. \u201cTonight\u2019s election shows, as Martin Luther King once said, that the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice. We\u2019re committed to keep fighting for justice, no matter how long it takes.\u201d", "President Donald Trump just ousted the Cabinet member who did the most to help him fulfill a campaign promise to harshly police undocumented immigrants.\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions submitted his letter of resignation on Wednesday, the day after the election, at Trump\u2019s request. His departure was months in the making: The president has repeatedly voiced dissatisfaction with Sessions over his handling of the investigation into the Trump campaign\u2019s ties to Russia.\n\nBut Sessions\u2019 legacy will live on in his actions on immigration, a signature issue for both the former senator and the president. Sessions used his time as attorney general to rail against undocumented immigrants and MS-13 gang members, implement punitive measures that led to the separation of families at the border, narrow guidelines for asylum, and elevate the prosecution of petty immigration violations to one of the Justice Department\u2019s top priorities.\n\nThe full extent of Trump\u2019s crackdown on immigrants might not have happened without him.\n\n\u201cWe did our part to restore immigration enforcement,\u201d Sessions wrote in his resignation letter.\n\nWithin months of taking office in February 2017, Sessions instructed the U.S. attorneys in all 94 jurisdictions to prosecute immigration violations more aggressively. Though most unauthorized immigrants are detained and deported under civil law, jumping the border the first time is a misdemeanor punishable by up to six months in prison. Subsequent offenses can carry prison sentences of up to 20 years, depending upon the individual\u2019s criminal record, though in practice most serve far shorter sentences.\n\nThis year, Sessions went further, implementing a \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy that required the U.S. Border Patrol to refer every person they arrested for crossing illegally to the Department of Homeland Security for prosecution. The Trump administration\u2019s five-week-long experiment with systematic family separation was announced and made possible by Sessions, who took the unprecedented move of extending the zero tolerance prosecutions to mothers and fathers traveling with their children.\n\nAs of late October, 47 children that the Trump administration had separated from their parents remained apart from them and in government custody.\n\nThe Washington Post via Getty Images Jeff Sessions helped announce a \"zero tolerance\" policy that led to mass family separations at the border.\n\nSessions was also the face of Trump\u2019s controversial decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, even though DACA is run by the Department of Homeland Security. In September 2017, Trump sent out Sessions to announce the decision to put nearly 700,000 undocumented young people at risk of deportation.\n\nThe DACA decision was blocked in court, but Sessions has still done his best to move it forward. On Monday, the Justice Department asked the Supreme Court to take up a lawsuit on DACA in hopes it would allow the administration to terminate the program.\n\nSessions repeatedly tried to block federal funding for so-called sanctuary cities that limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement \u2015 an effort that could have deprived jurisdictions of money to fight crime based on their policies toward undocumented people. He was repeatedly foiled by the courts.\n\nA plan currently in the works to limit migrants\u2019 ability to request asylum at the border will likely be Sessions\u2019 final contribution to the Trump administration\u2019s immigration policy.\n\nSome of the attorney general\u2019s longest-lasting contributions may have been in the immigration courts, where as head of the Justice Department he could single-handedly reshape policy. In June, Sessions instructed those judges that \u201cgenerally\u201d immigrants seeking asylum based on gang or domestic violence do not qualify for it, potentially barring thousands of people fleeing danger from finding safety in the U.S.\n\nSessions\u2019 immigration moves weren\u2019t entirely opposed by critics. He pushed for hiring more immigration judges to address the courts\u2019 record backlogs, something that immigrant rights advocates and restrictionists alike largely support. But his department also put pressure on immigration judges to quickly complete cases through a quota system. The judges have accused Sessions of inappropriately influencing decisions, including in a complaint filed by the judges\u2019 union that alleges a case was transferred away from one judge because he didn\u2019t immediately order a man to be deported.\n\nAnd even as Sessions hired more judges, he pumped some 330,000 administratively closed deportation cases back into the system. The total immigration court backlog now exceeds 1 million cases \u2015 more than double the number when he started.", "FRESNO, Calif. \u2014 Andrew Janz lost the race to represent California\u2019s 22nd Congressional District by more than 11 percentage points to one of President Donald Trump\u2019s most loyal allies on Tuesday, but that didn\u2019t stop his fans from drinking wine, eating churros and rocking out to the corny songs that are staples at these kinds of events.\n\nDemocrats knew Janz didn\u2019t have much of a chance of winning in the bright red central California district, but at least he \u201chad the balls to compete,\u201d said Stacey Woo, a 48-year-old supporter.\n\nHuffPost California GOP Rep. Devin Nunes, a close Trump ally, survived a re-election challenge from Democrat Andrew Janz (right).\n\nDevin Nunes, the incumbent Janz lost to, was exactly the type of Republican that Democrats hoped to oust as part of the highly anticipated 2018 blue wave.\n\nHe shamelessly abused his power as head of the House Intelligence Committee to protect the president from a serious investigation by the panel into Russia\u2019s effort to help Trump win the 2016 election. He peddled conspiracy theories that seemed spoon-fed by the White House about Obama administration loyalists waging a \u201cdeep state\u201d campaign to undermine Trump. He voted to gut health care and he refused to show up for town halls with constituents.\n\nBut Janz\u2019 massive fundraising and voter outreach efforts weren\u2019t enough to put him over the top. And that same scenario repeated itself in some other red districts where Trump is popular.\n\nGOP Rep. Steve King, a white nationalist, held onto his seat in Iowa. Rep. Duncan Hunter, the California Republican under indictment for campaign fraud, won re-election. So will Rep. Chris Collins, the New York Republican indicted for insider trading.\n\nThese seemingly unflippable seats show just how deeply entrenched party loyalty is in vast swaths of the country and how hard it will be for Democrats to win in 2020.\n\nIn the case of Janz, he got more support in his district than any of his Democratic predecessors \u2014 Nunes won his last race by more than 30 points \u2014 but he still couldn\u2019t close the gap.\n\nJanz tried to keep spirits high at his Tuesday night gathering. He cheered the fact that Nunes will no longer head the House intelligence committee, with Democrats set to take over the chamber in January. He encouraged his supporters to work to defeat Trump two years from now.\n\nBut privately, Janz and his team were disappointed by the results. They didn\u2019t necessarily expect to win, but they had hoped it would be a little closer.\n\nHis campaign knocked on 25,000 doors and made 10,000 calls in the 24 hours before polls closed, Mari Harren, Janz\u2019s communications coordinator, told HuffPost late Tuesday night. \u201cI\u2019ve noticed that a lot of people in this district are party over policy,\u201d she said \u201cThey see red, that\u2019s all that matters to them. It\u2019s really disheartening.\u201d\n\nTo the south in San Diego, progressive Democrat Ammar Campa-Najjar also aggressively recruited Republican voters, but lost to Hunter by more than 8 points.\n\nCampa-Najjar wasn\u2019t expecting the race to be called so quickly in favor of Hunter, who faces a possible prison sentence for using $250,000 of campaign funds for personal expenses. At a campaign event in October, he had told supporters he expected the results from the San Diego district to be among the last to trickle in. News outlets called the race just a few hours after polls closed.\n\nIn Sioux City, Iowa, fans of J.D. Scholten, the Democrat who challenged King, were stunned that the incumbent had won a ninth term. \u201cYou know, I think in the past, we didn\u2019t really have a candidate,\u201d said Jonny Wilder, a 24-year-old fast food worker who drove three hours to Scholten\u2019s election night party. \u201cIt was always about voting against Steve King. J.D. this time gave us someone to vote for. I don\u2019t know, I thought we were gonna win. I\u2019m kinda shocked, to be honest.\u201d\n\nBack in Fresno, Josephine Perez, a 58-year-old social worker who lives in Nunes\u2019 district, said she doesn\u2019t usually make it to the polls for midterms. But this year felt different. As a woman of color, she said worried about her sons being racially profiled and is horrified by how open Trump is about his prejudice toward anyone who isn\u2019t white.\n\nSick of watching Nunes fall in line behind the president, especially on hardline immigration issues, she made it a point to participate in this year\u2019s midterm and vote for Janz.\n\nHarren, Janz\u2019s communications coordinator, hopes that people like Perez don\u2019t give up after seeing another Democrat fail to oust Nunes. \u201cWe\u2019re all just hopeful that maybe the little wave we started here will turn into something bigger in 2020,\u201d she said.\n\nChristopher Mathias contributed reporting.", "WASHINGTON \u2013 President Donald Trump will see renewed congressional probes of his campaign\u2019s contacts with Russia, have his Cabinet members spending more of their days getting grilled on Capitol Hill, and could see his long-secret tax returns become public, all thanks to Democratic wins in Tuesday\u2019s congressional elections.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump took a victory lap anyway.\n\n\u201cI was very well received by the people our country,\u201d he said during a White House news conference, referring to his frenetic series of rallies around the country in the closing weeks of the campaign. \u201cI think people like me. I think people like the job I\u2019m doing.\u201d\n\nIn that 86-minute session with reporters and in a series of statements on Twitter, Trump claimed that Republicans had done extraordinarily well in the elections and had done so almost entirely thanks to him.\n\n\u201cThe candidates that I supported achieved tremendous success last night. As an example, of the 11 candidates we campaigned with during the last week, nine won last night,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThis vigorous campaigning stopped the blue wave that they talked about.\u201d\n\nEven Republicans were left scratching their heads about Trump\u2019s interpretation of the elections, which will give Democrats \u2015 likely, California Democrat and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi \u2015 the speaker\u2019s gavel come January.\n\n\u201cCome on, you don\u2019t lose control of the House and call it a great night,\u201d said GOP consultant John Weaver, who ran Ohio Gov. John Kasich\u2019s presidential campaign in 2016. \u201cYou don\u2019t lose seven governorships and call it a great night. You don\u2019t lose 300 [state] legislative seats and call it a great night.\u201d\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS \u201cI think people like me. I think people like the job I\u2019m doing,\" Trump said Wednesday.\n\nRick Tyler, who worked on Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, said Trump was correct that Democrats did not win as many seats as out-of-power parties have won in some previous midterms. It was also true, he added, that the party in power does not typically gain Senate seats in a midterm.\n\nHowever, he pointed out that the only reason Republicans were able to do well in the Senate was that Democrats had done extraordinarily well during Senate elections in 2006 and 2012, leaving them with a large number of vulnerable senators in heavily Republican states.\n\n\u201cThe reality is, the Republicans hit the Senate map lottery. It was just a bad year for Democrats,\u201d Tyler said, adding that with the economy as strong as it is and unemployment as low as it is, the real question is why Republicans did not do better.\n\n\u201cYou would have expected the Republicans to have gotten re-elected to the majority,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cThey lost the House because of him.\u201d\n\nTrump, predictably, tried to sell the exact opposite story. After boasting that candidates who had appeared with him at rallies had won \u2015 but failing to mention the dozens of candidates he had endorsed who nevertheless lost \u2015 Trump read through a list of Republican House members who lost Tuesday and blamed them for not embracing Trump.\n\n\u201cThey did very poorly. I\u2019m not sure that I should be happy or sad, but I feel just fine about it. Carlos Curbelo, Mike Coffman \u2015 too bad, Mike \u2015 Mia Love,\u201d he said of Republicans from South Florida, Colorado and Utah who distanced themselves from Trump because he is so disliked in their districts. \u201cBut Mia Love gave me no love. And she lost. Too bad. Sorry about that, Mia.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s claims of \u201cgreat success,\u201d of course, are nothing new for him. He has claimed great success in virtually everything he has done during his adult life, from his failed casinos to his money-losing airline. In a deposition for a lawsuit he filed against an author for writing that he was not really a billionaire, Trump would repeatedly claim ownership of an asset as proof of his wealth \u2015 but then, after it was pointed out to him that he didn\u2019t actually have ownership of that asset, he would argue that not owning it was, in fact, preferable to owning it.\n\nTrump used a similar strategy on Wednesday, arguing that losing the House to Democrats was preferable to holding it by a small margin because there would always be some difficult-to-please Republican members who could sink legislation. \u201cAnd now, we have a much easier path, because the Democrats will come to us with a plan for infrastructure, a plan for health care, a plan for whatever they are looking at, and we\u2019ll negotiate,\u201d he said.\n\nThat, for Weaver, was a favorite part of Trump\u2019s explanations on Wednesday. \u201cYou can actually pass more legislation if you don\u2019t have control of the Congress,\u201d he laughed. \u201cDid you know that?\u201d", "A British woman\u2019s engagement to a ghost she met in Australia is getting others into the wedding spirit.\n\nLast week, Amethyst Realm of Bristol announced that the unnamed ghost proposed to her during a road trip to England\u2019s Wookey Hole caves in Somerset.\n\n\u201cThere was no going down on one knee \u2014 he doesn\u2019t have knees,\u201d she said about the proposal. \u201cI could actually hear his voice, and it was beautiful.

The name Ho-Chunk comes from the Hochungra, which means \u201cPeople of the Big Voice\u201d \u2015 and hers was certainly on display Tuesday night.\n\nHaaland, an enrolled member of the Laguna Pueblo Nation (located west of Albuquerque, New Mexico), won in her state\u2019s 1st Congressional District, a historically Democratic stronghold, besting Republican Janice Arnold-Jones with relative ease.\n\nMy grandmother was born and raised at Laguna Pueblo, and as I watched Tuesday night\u2019s returns come in, I imagined how she would have reacted to the sight of Haaland and Davids marching on Washington, D.C. These women refused to be silenced despite coming from humble origins, and their fortitude and resilience make them so recognizable to me.\n\nBrian Snyder/Reuters Deb Haaland takes the stage Tuesday after becoming one of two Native American women to be elected to the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nOf course, Native Americans practiced self-government long before the arrival of European settlers and subsequent colonization \u2015 and we enjoy recognition as sovereign nations to this day. But the fact that multiple Native American women succeeded at the polls is especially monumental considering our people weren\u2019t even given full legal protection of our voting rights until less than 60 years ago.\n\nThe 1924 Snyder Act entitled U.S.-born Native Americans to full citizenship and the right to vote, but the Constitution left it up to each individual state to decide just who was allowed to enter the voting booth. As a result, most Native Americans were disenfranchised until 1948, when the Arizona Supreme Court struck down a provision that stopped its Native American citizens from exercising their right. Other states eventually followed Arizona\u2019s lead, and in 1962, New Mexico was the last state to strike down unfair laws that prevented us from voting. On Tuesday, that state elected Haaland to Congress.\n\nFor some Native Americans, our voting rights remain challenged to this day. In North Dakota, ID requirements that demand voters provide identification with a \u201cprovable street address\u201d in order to cast a ballot meant many from the Lakota Nation and other tribes had to scramble in the eleventh hour to come up with proper ID before heading to the polls. This nation\u2019s sordid history and current controversies when it comes to Native American rights makes the election victories of Davids and Haaland all the sweeter. Add to their wins those of down-ballot candidates such as Peggy Flanagan (White Earth Nation Band of Ojibwe, elected lieutenant governor of Minnesota) and Debra Lekanoff (Alaska Native, elected to Washington state\u2019s House of Representatives), and we have even more cause for celebration.\n\nTHE ASSOCIATED PRESS Peggy Flanagan reacts after being elected lieutenant governor of Minnesota on Tuesday.\n\nWith these women in office, Americans can expect an indigenous version of leadership: reciprocity that begins with the art of listening. Haaland campaigned on a strong environmental message and has promised stronger regulations against corporations that pollute. It\u2019s easy to see why this is important to her, as New Mexico is a region at risk in terms of environmental contamination. Davids ran on school improvements and affordable health care, and as Kansas\u2019 first openly gay congresswoman, we can also expect her to fight for LGBTQ rights.\n\nIn our traditional belief systems, Native American leaders truly serve their community, pride themselves on sacrifice and aim to spend time with their constituents. In an era when many criticize politicians for \u201closing touch\u201d with the people they serve, voters can feel confident these women will remain connected to their hometown roots.\n\nTuesday night\u2019s wins have been years in the making, and they mark a significant turning point for Native Americans in this country. The victories of Haaland, Davids and others inspire hope that indigenous nations still have allies, the spirit to fight and an opportunity to create change.", "President Donald Trump\u2019s pick to replace Attorney General Jeff Sessions and oversee special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation has sharply criticized the probe in the past.\n\nMatt Whitaker, a former federal prosecutor, was appointed as acting attorney general after Sessions handed in his resignation, the president announced Wednesday. Whitaker has served as Sessions\u2019 chief of staff since September 2017.\n\nTo Trump\u2019s unrelenting ire, Sessions was unable to rein in Mueller\u2019s expansive probe into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and whether the president obstructed justice, given Sessions\u2019 decision to recuse himself from the probe in March 2017.\n\nWith Sessions out of the picture, Trump has selected someone who has expressed significant skepticism about Mueller\u2019s investigation, signaling the president could be pushing for an imminent end to it.\n\nWhitaker, during an interview with CNN in July 2017, suggested that a potential future replacement for Sessions wouldn\u2019t need to fire Mueller to kneecap the investigation.\n\n\u201cI could see a scenario where Jeff Sessions is replaced with a recess appointment and that attorney general does not fire Bob Mueller, but he just reduces his budget to so low that his investigation grinds to almost a halt,\u201d Whitaker said at the time.\n\nIn August 2017, roughly a month before his appointment as Sessions\u2019 chief of staff, Whitaker penned an op-ed for CNN in which he suggested the Russia investigation was \u201cgoing too far\u201d and could be \u201ca witch hunt.\u201d\n\n\u201cMueller has come up to a red line in the Russia 2016 election-meddling investigation that he is dangerously close to crossing,\u201d Whitaker wrote. \u201cIt is time for Rosenstein, who is the acting attorney general for the purposes of this investigation, to order Mueller to limit the scope of his investigation to the four corners of the order appointing him special counsel.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t, then Mueller\u2019s investigation will eventually start to look like a political fishing expedition. This would not only be out of character for a respected figure like Mueller, but also could be damaging to the President of the United States and his family \u2015 and by extension, to the country.\u201d\n\nWhitaker also has ties to a witness on Mueller\u2019s grand jury, Sam Clovis. Clovis, whose 2014 Iowa state treasurer campaign Whitaker chaired, dismissed concerns that their connection could affect the investigation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not relevant and Matt has high integrity,\u201d Clovis told The Washington Post. \u201cI\u2019m very happy for him and he\u2019ll do a fantastic job.\u201d\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) on Wednesday called on Whitaker to recuse himself from the Mueller probe, citing his previous remarks on the matter.\n\n\u201cGiven his previous comments advocating defunding and imposing limitations on the Mueller investigation, Mr. Whitaker should recuse himself from its oversight for the duration of his time as acting attorney general,\u201d Schumer said in a statement.\n\nSen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, echoed Schumer\u2019s call.\n\n\u201cGiven Mr. Whitaker\u2019s public comments on the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation and the President\u2019s obvious self-interest in appointing him to the Acting AG role, Mr. Whitaker should recuse himself,\u201d Warner tweeted.\n\nGiven Mr. Whitaker\u2019s public comments on the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation and the President\u2019s obvious self-interest in appointing him to the Acting AG role, Mr. Whitaker should recuse himself. https://t.co/XuRpcT3Gxd \u2014 Mark Warner (@MarkWarner) November 7, 2018", "As smartphones become more a part of our daily lives, many parents question how old their kids should be to have a device of their own.\n\nAt HuffPost Parents\u2019 How To Raise A Kid conference in Brooklyn on Friday, technology and children\u2019s media experts discussed what parents should consider before handing over a cellphone to their children.\n\nWhile many apps have age requirements (for example, Facebook and Instagram are supposed to be for people 13 and up), there\u2019s no definitive answer for parents wondering when kids can handle the responsibility and the content that comes with having a personal smartphone.\n\nOur panelists, however, did offer tips on how parents can make this decision at home a bit easier. Check out their advice below.\n\nJill Murphy, vice president and editor-in-chief at Common Sense Media, which provides reviews and information about family-friendly shows, movies and apps:\n\nAt the conference, Murphy noted that the team at Common Sense Media hears three popular concerns from caretakers: how much screen time should kids have, how to deal with YouTube and its content, and when kids should get a smartphone. She explained that different families will have different reasons for giving their kids phones.\n\n\u201cIt really does depend on what\u2019s going on with your family,\u201d she said. \u201cYou may be a single parent and you work in the afternoon when your kid is getting out of school, or they\u2019re not in after-care and you like them to have a smartphone because that\u2019s how you guys connect in the afternoon so they can go home and you feel better about it. There are plenty of positive things that we have with this new technology.\u201d\n\nCaretakers should keep in mind, though, that giving a phone to kids who are not emotionally or developmentally ready can create many challenges. Murphy suggested coming up with a family media plan or agreement (Common Sense offers them). Although a contract can seem \u201ccheesy,\u201d she said, it\u2019s a helpful way for parents to establish any ground rules and how they expect their kids to behave with their phone online and off.\n\nAstrakan Images via Getty Images Panelists at our How To Raise A Kid conference on Friday made it clear there's no definitive answer for caretakers wondering how old their kid should be before they get a phone.\n\nNicole Dreiske, executive director of the International Children\u2019s Media Center and author of The Upside of Digital Devices: How to Make Your Child More Screen Smart, Literate, and Emotionally Intelligent:\n\nDreiske, who moderated the panel, also encouraged families to consider having a media agreement. Whether you create a plan yourself or turn to one available online, Dreiske stressed the importance of parents using \u201cwelcoming\u201d language when discussing these agreements or talking to kids about their phones.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re already so emotionally worried about screens that often, the tone we use when we\u2019re talking to our kids about how they\u2019re using them is less than welcoming, and it does not invite them to confide in us,\u201d she said.\n\nDreiske told HuffPost she especially likes the tech contract from Janell Burley Hofmann, author of iRules: What Every Tech-Healthy Family Needs to Know about Selfies, Sexting, Gaming, and Growing Up. It includes her favorite guideline for kids with phones: \u201cYou are not a rude person; do not allow the iPhone to change that.\u201d\n\nSada Malladi, founder and CEO of Vimana, a system that helps parents manage what kids do online:\n\nWhile discussing what smartphones and similar devices generally accomplish for people, Malladi offered three categories: education, entertainment and communication. For parents struggling to figure out when it\u2019s appropriate to get their child a phone, Malladi suggested that they use these categories and ask themselves, \u201cWhat role do you want this device to play in the child\u2019s life?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you ask that question, the answer will be right there for you,\u201d he said.\n\nTitania Jordan, chief parenting officer of Bark.us, a parental control phone tracker:\n\nJordan made it clear that it\u2019s less about age and more about what works for your family, because \u201cnot every family dynamic is the same and not every child is the same.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have to really evaluate what is best for your family, for your family values and for your child\u2019s developmental health and needs,\u201d she said. \u201cIf your child is susceptible to anxiety and depression, really know how that\u2019s going to affect them to be looking at everybody\u2019s best lives, their filtered lives, and not necessarily seeing real life.\u201d\n\nJordan also stressed the importance of parents modeling the behavior they want their kids to mirror when it comes to their phones.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m talking to my child from behind a smartphone, that\u2019s a lot different than face-to-face and turning it off and putting it on silent at the dinner table and drawing a really firm line in the sand,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile all the information surrounding screen time and smartphones can be overwhelming, Jordan reminded the conference audience that parents today must be open to talking about this relatively new topic without the fear of being judged.", "Letitia James made history on election night by becoming the first African-American woman to be elected attorney general of New York.\n\nJames, the public advocate for New York City, also broke barriers as first black woman elected to statewide office in New York, the first woman of any race to be elected as the state\u2019s attorney general, and the first black person to serve in that position.\n\nThank you New York.

According to a recent CDC report, the birth rate for twins has increased a whopping 76 per cent since 1980. In fact, one in every 30 babies born in 2009 was a twin (compared to 1980, when the rate was one baby in every 53). What\u2019s with the binary-baby boom? One factor contributing to the upsurge: The age of mothers has trended up over the years, and a woman in her thirties is more likely to have twins than someone in her twenties, according to the study\u2019s lead author, epidemiologist Joyce Martin, MPH. However, while age is an independent risk factor for twins, it also tends to correlate with increased use of fertility treatments, which was likely the biggest contributor to the spike in twin births.\n\nShutterstock", "Before visiting Lyon, France, for the first time earlier this year, photographer and editor Liam Campbell says he\u2019d long bought into the stereotype of the French as \u201cwild\u201d and \u201csexually charged\u201d people.\n\nInstead, Campbell found Lyon to be a beautiful city with a \u201cproud, positive and open\u201d queer community. He\u2019s photographed and profiled 15 gay men from the city for the latest issue of Elska, which hit newsstands this week.\n\nThe 172-page issue, he said, is the \u201cmost seductive\u201d edition of the bimonthly queer culture and lifestyle magazine in the three years since its founding.\n\nLiam Campbell In Liam Campbell's words, Elska focuses on \u201cregular\u201d men as opposed to celebrities and models in an effort to show that \u201ceveryone is beautiful, sexy and lovable.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a good contingent of French readers since the beginning, and after 20 issues, it felt well overdue to visit the country,\u201d Campbell told HuffPost. \u201cI personally have a sort of second city bias. I knew that Paris would offer amazing settings and interesting and diverse participants, but I wanted our first venture into France to be less expected.\u201d\n\nElska \u2015 which translates to \u201clove\u201d in Icelandic \u2015 has established a unique reputation in LGBTQ media. As Campbell puts it, the magazine focuses on \u201cregular\u201d men, as opposed to celebrities and models, in an effort to show that \u201ceveryone is beautiful, sexy and lovable.\u201d The magazine has featured pictorials shot in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia; Mumbai, India; and Haifa, Israel, among other world cities.\n\nLiam Campbell Campbell says a few of the men featured in the magazine told him they wished for \u201cmore dedicated queer spaces and activism\u201d in Lyon.\n\nIn essays accompanying the photo series, the men get frank about their family lives, their adventures in love and their struggles. One of the magazine\u2019s subjects, identified as Julien R., takes an \u201chonest, poetic\u201d look back at his romantic conquests, while another, Milan E., discusses the difficulty he had moving on from a relationship.\n\nMarriage equality became the law of the land in France in 2013, and the country is overall regarded as an LGBTQ-inclusive destination. Still, Campbell says he found many of the queer-owned businesses and associations in Lyon to be under-patronized, and a few of the men featured in the magazine told him they wished for \u201cmore dedicated queer spaces and activism.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a sense that there\u2019s nothing to fight for, but there\u2019s still so much,\u201d Campbell said, citing as an example the ongoing lack of knowledge around HIV prevention medications like pre-exposure prophylaxis.\n\nView more photos from Elska\u2019s latest issue below:", "President Donald Trump is under fire for his reaction to a Japanese reporter\u2019s question.\n\nThe reporter, who had an accent, began asking Trump a question regarding the economy at a press conference at the White House on Wednesday following the midterm elections.\n\nThe president interjected, asking, \u201cWhere are you from, please?\u201d\n\nWhen the reporter responded with \u201cJapan,\u201d Trump told him to \u201csay hello to Shinzo,\u201d referencing the country\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe.\n\nTrump tells a Japanese reporter \"say hello to Shinzo,\" then continues the snarks with: \"I'm sure he's happy about tariffs on his cars.\" He then tells the reporter, who has an accent, \"I can't understand you.\"\n\n\n\nI had to close my eyes for 10 seconds with a deep sigh on this one. pic.twitter.com/6rYdcPy0Gh \u2014 Amee Vanderpool (@girlsreallyrule) November 7, 2018\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s happy about tariffs on his cars,\u201d Trump said.\n\nWhen the reporter attempted to finish his question about trade, the president responded, saying, \u201cI really don\u2019t understand you.\u201d\n\nTrump eventually answered, claiming Japan has treated the U.S. \u201cvery unfairly\u201d when it comes to the auto trade.\n\nThe president\u2019s handling of the question prompted criticism from many who viewed Trump\u2019s reactions to the reporter as racist or condescending.\n\nHe really is tactless.

But in the nation\u2019s gubernatorial offices, the picture is more complicated and less encouraging.\n\nOn election night, women picked up three more governorships than they had going in. But the number of female governors is still tiny: There are now nine women set to run states, tying the previous record set in 2004. (There were 16 women in the running this year.) Though it\u2019s possible that Democrat Stacey Abrams will ultimately prevail in her bid for the governor\u2019s seat in Georgia, the number of women running states will still be small.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been painstakingly slow to get women elected as governor,\u201d said Deborah Walsh, the director of the Center for Women and Politics at Rutgers University.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Stacey Abrams still has a chance to become the governor of Georgia.\n\nElection night 2018 proved that voters are getting increasingly comfortable with the idea of sending a woman to Congress, where she\u2019ll be a part of a decision-making body. This is partly because the notion of a female legislator lines up fairly well with stereotypes about women, who are often perceived as more collaborative and good at working in groups.\n\nBut when it comes to the governor\u2019s office, those stereotypes fall apart. There is still a big obstacle in getting voters to see a woman as the ultimate decision-maker.\n\n\u201cThe big story is the wave of women [in the 2018 election] and it is exciting, but we have known there are additional barriers for women when it comes to executive office,\u201d said Amanda Hunter, a communications director at the Barbara Lee Foundation, which has studied every female gubernatorial candidate\u2019s race over the past 20 years.\n\nWhen the foundation first started studying the topic, only 16 women had ever been elected governor. Now, the number is 48 (49 if Abrams wins). Meanwhile, over 2,300 men have done the job.\n\nWomen must work twice as hard to prove they\u2019re qualified for office, Hunter said. Men can simply list off their work history to show they\u2019re up for the job, but women have to offer concrete examples of their effectiveness, she said.\n\nAnd women are more likely to be criticized on their perceived lack of qualifications \u2015 a standard that\u2019s even higher for women of color. Abrams, for example, has been called out by conservatives as \u201cunqualified\u201d because she carries debt \u2015 meanwhile, those same conservatives support President Donald Trump, who\u2019s owed legendary sums over his career.\n\nWomen seeking executive office walk the same kind of tightrope that women gunning for the CEO job face. They must be likable, but also be perceived as tough. Often those traits conflict (see: Clinton, Hillary.) And if a woman isn\u2019t likable, she\u2019s perceived as less womanly \u2015 a big gender violation that\u2019s tough to recover from.\n\nMen can just focus on being tough and strong, said Stefanie Johnson, a professor at the University of Colorado Boulder\u2019s Leeds School of Business who\u2019s researched the double-bind women leaders face.\n\n\u201cPeople see men as jerks but they just don\u2019t care, they still like them,\u201d she said.\n\nLanding CEO jobs has always been harder for women. Fewer than 5 percent of the chief executives in the S&P 500 are women and, of course, there\u2019s never been a female president.\n\nRutgers\u2019 Walsh also pointed out that governors are less visible on a national stage, so voters rarely get to see a woman in that role represented in the media \u2015 unless there\u2019s some breakout national story (like when then-South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley took the national stage after removing the Confederate flag from her statehouse).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s only going to be as more women are in those jobs and people see them doing that successfully and visibly that we\u2019ll see change,\u201d Walsh said.\n\nIndeed, once a state elects a woman governor, it seems to break down the barrier. Tuesday night, Michigan elected its second female governor, as did Kansas. New Hampshire has had more than one female governor.\n\nTo be sure, there were a lot of firsts for female governors Tuesday \u2015 as there were for women up and down the ballot. South Dakota elected its first female governor, Republican Kristi Noem. Iowa did the same with Republican Kim Reynolds.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Krisi Noem, South Dakota's first female governor, campaigning with Trump\n\nAs the old adage goes: You can\u2019t be it, if you don\u2019t see it.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that this most recent wave of women legislators will set a new example of what a leader looks like. And if 2018 is the new guidebook, there are lots of options. Plenty of women in this cycle ran as their authentic selves \u2015 talking about being parents or soldiers, and opening up about their racial backgrounds and personal experiences.\n\nThere seem to be more possibilities for women when it comes to being considered executive material or likable.\n\nFor example, Gretchen Whitmer, the Democrat who just won the race for governor in Michigan, used the tagline \u201cFix the Damn Roads,\u201d in her campaign.", "MOSCOW, Nov 6 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - \u201cGood Night Stories for Rebel Girls,\u201d a bestselling children\u2019s book featuring 100 stories of prominent women, was published in Russia this year - but with one story missing.\n\nLiza Lazerson, a feminist blogger who owns a copy, said she was surprised to see that while the cover promised 100 stories the book contained only 99 and one blank page - supposedly for the reader to add their own.\n\n\u201cBut then a follower sent me a photo of Coy Mathis\u2019s story from the French edition,\u201d Lazerson, who is based in Moscow, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in written comments.\n\nMathis, an 11-year-old transgender girl from the United States, won a landmark victory in a 2013 case against her school allowing her to use the girl\u2019s bathroom.\n\nBombora, which printed the book in Russia, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe Russian news site Takie Dela has quoted the publisher as saying that it excised the story due to Russia\u2019s 2013 ban on the spreading \u201cpropaganda for non-traditional sexual relations\u201d to minors.\n\nThe law is seen by campaigners as an attempt by President Vladimir Putin to draw closer to his electorate, most of whom are Orthodox Christians.\n\nRussia is one of Europe\u2019s least gay-friendly countries, ranked 45th out of 49 nations by ILGA-Europe, a network of LGBT+ rights groups.\n\nFrancesca Cavallo, one of the authors of \u201cGood Night Stories for Rebel Girls,\u201d said she was \u201cdeeply saddened that Coy\u2019s story has been left out.\u201d\n\nHomosexuality was deemed a criminal offence in Russia until 1993 and classed as a mental illness until 1999.\n\nHate crimes against LGBT+ people have surged in the wake of the gay propaganda law and courts have ordered that several LGBT+ websites be blocked, activists say.\n\nThe impact of the propaganda law on Russia\u2019s 56 billion ruble ($848 million) publishing industry is unclear.\n\nU.S. fantasy author Victoria Schwab said the publishing house Rosman last year edited an LGBT+ storyline out of the Russian edition of one of her Shades of Magic novels.\n\n\u201cThey redacted the entire queer plot without permission,\u201d she said on Twitter last year.\n\nA spokeswoman for Rosman declined to comment on its editing of LGBT+ content.\n\nThe publisher previously told Echo of Moscow radio station that just one scene, rather the entire plot, was cut and that Russian publishers \u201care often forced to resort to this kind of editing.\u201d\n\nUnder the current laws, publishers can either remove LGBT+ content from books aimed at children and teenagers, or mark them as appropriate for audiences over 18. They are also obliged to seal all \u201c18+ books\u201d in plastic wrap.\n\n\u201c(This means), as a reader, I will not be able to flip through it and decide whether I need the book,\u201d said Lena Klimova, founder of Deti-404, an online support group for LGBT+ teenagers, which has been accused of spreading gay propaganda.\n\nKlimova has published two books - one about the struggles of LGBT+ teenagers in Russia, another a collection giving advice to young girls that also mentions issues of sexuality.\n\nShe used a self-publishing service, but marked both as 18+ as it was \u201cthe only possible option.\u201d\n\nShe also uploaded the books online, which makes them available to audiences of all ages.\n\n\u201cIt is very important for teenagers to see characters that are like them,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThis way they don\u2019t feel alone (and realize that) \u2018people like me exist. It\u2019s all right to be me.\u2019\u201d ($1 = 66.0081 roubles)", "There\u2019s a new Grinch in town, and he wouldn\u2019t touch your fan theories with a 39-and-a-half-foot pole. Especially not that one theory.\n\nMaybe the most famous of Dr. Seuss creations, the Grinch is an ever-recurring presence in TV and film. His overweening torso has appeared in the classic 1966 holiday cartoon and Jim Carrey\u2019s 2000 live-action film \u201cHow the Grinch Stole Christmas,\u201d and it will appear once again in Illumination\u2019s upcoming animated remake, \u201cThe Grinch,\u201d starring Benedict Cumberbatch as the titular humanoid.\n\nIn most renditions, the Grinch has a reputation for being a curmudgeon with a disturbing heart condition. He always realizes the true meaning of Christmas eventually, particularly after the Whos sing like angels even though the Grinch pilfered their presents.\n\nBut are these stories actually darker than you suspected?\n\nWe took our questions to Cumberbatch, the latest resident green Santa impersonator, who weighed in on the grimmest fan theories we could throw at him. Was he contractually obligated to answer every prying, inconsequential question we had about the animated holiday movie? Who\u2019s to say? But here\u2019s what we got:\n\nIs the Grinch secretly trying to wipe out all the Whos?\n\nFirst, let\u2019s establish that How the Grinch Stole Christmas! might not be a standalone story. It could be connected to the Dr. Seuss tale Horton Hears a Who!, since both sagas involve a place called Whoville inhabited by Whos.\n\nIn Horton Hears a Who, which was published three years before How the Grinch Stole Christmas!, we learn that Whoville is so tiny that it exists on a speck of dust. It\u2019s such a big deal that Horton hears one of its inhabitants because the place is basically microscopic. In fact, we\u2019re led to believe that the only way Whos prevent giant creatures (who are actually normal-sized) from destroying their world is by making a lot of noise (singing and playing instruments).\n\nIn his article, Oliver explains that if the Grinch\u2019s plan to steal Christmas actually worked, causing the Whos to lose their Christmas spirit and cease their loud singing, they would be in danger of extinction because \u201cgiant\u201d creatures would no longer be made aware of the Whos\u2019 existence. It\u2019s not such a far-fetched thought. In Horton, Who lives are threatened every second. Oliver points out that Horton\u2019s decriers wanted to put the Whos\u2019 dust speck in boiling oil. For defending the existence of Whos, Horton is tied up, beaten and \u201cmauled.\u201d\n\nKnowing how dark that story gets, does a possible Grinch plot to destroy the Whos seem that implausible?\n\n\u201cNope, I don\u2019t believe that theory, not even once,\u201d Cumberbatch told HuffPost. \u201cAnnihilation? I think he just really wants to stop Christmas from happening because that\u2019s one of the things that is loudest and most joyous. They\u2019re not singing out of self-defense to be identified, they\u2019re singing out of pure unbridled joy, and I think that\u2019s the thing he doesn\u2019t feel he can take part in.\u201d\n\nThe actor continued, \u201cThere\u2019s a deep sadness in him ... and he\u2019s got the wrong idea about Christmas as well. He thinks it\u2019s the material trappings of Christmas that are the heart and soul of it. [The singing is] still the thing that transforms him when he sees how happy they are without the things he thought were making them happy.\u201d\n\nOf all the theories, Cumberbatch seemed to think this one stinks, stanks, stunk more than the rest. But we kept going.\n\nIs the Grinch\u2019s first name \u201cThe\u201d?\n\nIn the Grinch stories, including the new movie, he\u2019s usually called Mr. Grinch, the Grinch, or simply Grinch, leading some fans to assume that \u201cGrinch\u201d is the character\u2019s last name. His first name, accordingly, might be \u201cThe.\u201d\n\nCumberbatch, who\u2019s no stranger to people bungling his name, disagreed wholeheartedly.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he has a first name,\u201d said the actor, claiming that, like Madonna, Grinch is a one name kind of being.\n\n\u201cSomething like that, yeah. Eminem. Exactly.\u201d\n\nCould the Grinch\u2019s dog Max have been found in the trash?\n\nIllumination and Universal Max's origin story revealed?\n\nIf you can be sure of anything, it\u2019s that the Grinch harbors so much hatred he\u2019ll invade homes and steal children\u2019s gifts. So, how are we supposed to believe he has it in him to acquire a little dog named Max and subsequently care for him?\n\nIn the Jim Carrey movie, we\u2019re told that the Grinch\u2019s home of Mount Crumpit is the landing spot for Whoville\u2019s trash. So, did Max somehow wind up in the garbage as a puppy? Is that how the Grinch eventually found him?\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good question,\u201d Cumberbatch said, considering the theory. \u201cI don\u2019t really know the answer. Maybe Max met the Grinch, not the other way around. Maybe Max just got lost one day and they ended up being friends?\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone says this Grinch is nice, possibly too nice \u2015 well, no one says too nice, but he does treat animals well,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s a sweet theory. Maybe Max was forgotten about.\u201d\n\nDoes the Grinch just need a cardiologist?\n\nThe Grinch\u2019s alarmingly small heart size seems to be the crux of all his anger issues. At the end of the Seuss story, when his heart grows to the tune of the Whos\u2019 singing, he surrenders to the glee of holiday season and basically becomes Mr. Christmas.\n\nWould everything have been solved if he\u2019d just seen a cardiologist?\n\n\u201cI think hearts are made the size they are in Whoville out of love, not out of physiology and biology,\u201d Cumberbatch explained. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a medical matter, and who\u2019s to say he hasn\u2019t [gone to one]. He gets cold pretty easy for a guy who lives in the mountain, so something\u2019s not right with his heart. Circulation\u2019s not good.\u201d\n\nIs the mysterious \u201croast beast\u201d actually a Who?\n\nPerhaps the weirdest of the fan theories suggests those lovable Whos are actually the who\u2019s who of who Whos should worry about.\n\nHave you ever thought it was weird that the Grinch eats something called Who Hash? One Twitter user did, and in a long thread offered a hypothesis as to the true identity of the mysterious \u201croast beast\u201d that the Grinch ends up carving at Christmas dinner.\n\nAre the Whos eating another Who?\n\nI would like to take a moment to discuss something that has always bothered me every holiday season.\n\n\n\nI think it's weird that the Whos down in Whoville and The Grinch are carnivores. pic.twitter.com/8zew11v3Bw \u2014 Geraldine (@everywhereist) November 28, 2017\n\n\u201cThe Whos are not cannibals,\u201d Cumberbatch said. \u201cThey are not vegan either. Certainly not vegan. It\u2019s not a massive plant-based beast, that\u2019s for sure. I think it\u2019s sort of a nondenominational piece of meat. It could be kosher, it could be pork, it could be any under the spectrum.\u201d", "On a crowded California ballot with a gas tax, caged chickens, rent control and more fighting for voters\u2019 attention, one quiet proposition that sought to pave the way for permanent daylight saving time easily sailed to victory Tuesday.\n\nWith nearly all precincts counted, about 60 percent of Californians came out in favor of Prop 7, an effort by state Rep. Kansen Chu of San Jose to make daylight saving time a year-round fixture in the Golden State.\n\nBut if those voters thought they were once and for all ridding themselves of the semiannual nuisance of changing their clocks, they\u2019re in for a rude awakening. Here\u2019s why.\n\nIts passage just allows the state Legislature to vote on it.\n\nProp 7 merely allows California\u2019s state Legislature to take a vote on the issue. If it does so, the shift to daylight saving time will only be approved with two-thirds voting in favor.\n\nState lawmakers who support it, such as Chu and Rep. Lorena Gonzalez, point to studies that have found that time changes increase energy consumption and disrupt sleep patterns, thus leading to higher rates of heart attacks and strokes in vulnerable populations.\n\nThose who are against it \u2015 such as Sen. Hannah-Beth Jackson, who wrote the opposition argument for the ballot \u2015 say changing California\u2019s time system would be a massive disruption, put the state out of sync with its neighbors and make for an overall unpleasant experience.\n\nThe Washington Post via Getty Images Permanent daylight saving time would mean much later sunrises throughout the year, but Californians probably won't need to worry about that.\n\n\u201cWe now have Daylight Saving Time in the summer so we can have extra light in the evening, when we can enjoy it, rather than having that daylight between 5 and 6 in the morning when we\u2019d prefer it were dark,\u201d Jackson explained. \u201cAnd then in the winter we switch back to Standard Time so it\u2019s not so dark in the morning.\u201d\n\nDespite the arguments on both sides, no one raised any money for or against Prop 7, so it\u2019s unclear how likely the Legislature is to ever take up the issue.\n\nEven then, permanent daylight saving time is unlikely to happen any time soon.\n\nThanks to the Uniform Time Act passed by U.S. Congress in 1966, states that observe daylight saving time must have it \u201cbegin and end on federally mandated dates.\u201d Therefore, California can\u2019t set an end date that doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nSo even with Prop 7 passing, and even if two-thirds of California state lawmakers support permanent daylight saving time, nothing will change unless there\u2019s a federal move to end the Uniform Time Act or exempt California.\n\nThere\u2019s no indication that\u2019s going to happen. Just take a look at how it shook out in Florida, where the passage of the \u201cSunshine Protection Act\u201d this past summer meant nothing. Sen. Marco Rubio filed two bills that would allow the change to happen, but Congress took no action on them.\n\nThe time changed in Florida this past Sunday just like it did in most of the country.\n\nBut why don\u2019t Hawaii and Arizona have to observe the time change?\n\nDaylight saving time is not observed in Hawaii, most of Arizona, American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands. They can get away with that because they went the opposite route of Chu\u2019s proposal.\n\nWhile the Uniform Time Act stipulates how states may use daylight saving time, it does allow them to opt out of it. In other words, Hawaii and Arizona chose not to have daylight saving time at all.", "Princess Diana had a naughty sense of humor and a recently resurfaced card proves it.\n\nThe Princess of Wales sent the item, now up for sale at Julien\u2019s Auctions, to her accountant Anthony Burrows sometime in the 1990s.

They may also end up unseating Bill Nelson of Florida, a centrist Democrat whose extremely tight race is headed for a recount.

Sessions wrote that he had been \u201chonored to serve as Attorney General and have worked to implement the law enforcement agenda based on the rule of law that formed a central part of your campaign for the Presidency.\u201d\n\nIn what read like a defense of his handling of the Russia probe, Sessions wrote that he had worked to \u201csupport the fundamental legal processes that are the foundation of justice.\u201d\n\nTrump tweeted the news Wednesday afternoon, announcing he was naming Matthew Whitaker, Sessions\u2019 chief of staff, as acting attorney general.\n\nWhitaker now has oversight of the Mueller investigation. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein is no longer overseeing it, according to a Justice Department spokeswoman.\n\nBefore he was Sessions\u2019 chief of staff, Whitaker had written about limiting the Mueller probe, which he said could be a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d A Justice Department official said ethics officials have not yet reviewed whether Whitaker would have to recuse himself from any aspect of the Mueller probe given his prior commentary.\n\n\u201cIt is a true honor that the President has confidence in my ability to lead the Department of Justice as Acting Attorney General. I am committed to leading a fair Department with the highest ethical standards, that upholds the rule of law, and seeks justice for all Americans,\u201d Whitaker said in a statement on Wednesday evening.\n\n\u201cAttorney General Sessions has been a dedicated public servant for over 40 years. It has been a privilege to work under his leadership. He is a man of integrity who has served this nation well,\u201d Whitaker added.\n\nTrump And Sessions Spar\n\nSessions was an early supporter of Trump\u2019s campaign and one of the first people nominated to his Cabinet. But the president grew publicly frustrated with Sessions\u2019 leadership of the Justice Department, specifically his March 2017 decision to recuse himself from the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and alleged coordination with the Trump campaign. Shortly afterward, in May 2017, Rosenstein decided to appoint Mueller as special counsel to lead the FBI\u2019s Russia investigation \u2015 a decision that also angered Trump.\n\nWhen the president first heard Sessions would not be overseeing the FBI\u2019s Russia investigation, he went \u201cballistic,\u201d according to ABC News. In June 2017, CNN reported that the attorney general had at one point offered his resignation following multiple tense conversations with the president. In a July 2017 interview with The New York Times, Trump labeled Sessions\u2019 decision \u201cvery unfair to the president.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s frustration with Sessions became undeniable in late May of this year, when the president tweeted that he wished he hadn\u2019t named Sessions as head of the Justice Department.\n\nThe president\u2019s remarks came a day after The New York Times reported that he\u2019d asked Sessions to reverse his recusal from the Russia probe shortly after the attorney general announced it. Trump later pushed back, claiming that Sessions never told him he planned to recuse himself.\n\nThe president aired his frustration with Sessions again a month later, when he criticized the attorney general\u2019s handling of a House investigation into possible bias against Trump within the Justice Department.\n\nTrump took his critique of Sessions a step further in August, when he told a \u201cFox & Friends\u201d host that his attorney general \u201cnever took control\u201d of the Justice Department. Sessions fired back at Trump within hours, saying in a statement that he took control of the DOJ the day he was sworn in. He added that he has had \u201cunprecedented success at effectuating the President\u2019s agenda\u201d and said the DOJ wouldn\u2019t bow under political pressure.\n\n\u201cWhile I am Attorney General, the actions of the Department of Justice will not be improperly influenced by political considerations,\u201d Sessions said. The next day, Trump continued to attack Sessions, saying in a tweet that the attorney general should be going after Hillary Clinton.\n\nTrump\u2019s numerous tweets about the probe have themselves become a part of the investigation, The New York Times reported. Mueller is determining whether social media posts might constitute obstruction of justice.\n\nImplications For The Mueller Probe\n\nSpeculation that Sessions might be on his way out had ramped up ahead of Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections, with Trump hinting that sweeping changes were coming to the DOJ.\n\nElection Day saw the Democrats taking control of the House for the new Congress and promising a new level of oversight unlike what Trump has faced in his presidency so far. Republicans in the House have been reluctant to investigate Trump\u2019s more controversial policies or to critically oversee the Russia probe. Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), the chairman of the House intelligence committee, has fiercely defended the president in the wake of the investigation. With Tuesday\u2019s wins, the Democrats will gain subpoena power and are expected to double down on the probe.\n\nShortly after the news of Sessions\u2019 departure broke, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said the timing of Trump\u2019s announcement was \u201cvery suspect.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur paramount view is that any attorney general, whether this one or another one, should not be able to interfere with the Mueller investigation in any way,\u201d he told reporters on Capitol Hill.\n\nThe last tweet Trump sent before announcing the news Wednesday was about polling regarding the Mueller investigation:\n\nAccording to NBC News, Voters Nationwide Disapprove of the so-called Mueller Investigation (46%) more than they Approve (41%). You mean they are finally beginning to understand what a disgusting Witch Hunt, led by 17 Angry Democrats, is all about! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 7, 2018\n\nTrouble At DOJ\n\nSessions\u2019 departure comes at one of the most turbulent times in the modern history of the Justice Department. Trump fired both acting Attorney General Sally Yates and FBI Director James Comey last year, with the latter move sparking Rosenstein\u2019s decision to name a special counsel. Many key roles in the Justice Department remain unfilled. Trump has also repeatedly and publicly attacked Sessions, Rosenstein and the entire DOJ \u2015 attacks Sessions did little to thwart and which have taken a considerable toll on morale at the department.\n\nIn spite of attacks from the president, Sessions remained faithful in implementing many key aspects of Trump\u2019s agenda. During his stint as the nation\u2019s top law enforcement official, Sessions rolled back drug sentencing reforms, backed off federal investigations of local police departments, reversed an Obama-era policy that curtailed the Justice Department\u2019s use of private prisons and relaxed restrictions on the use of civil asset forfeiture. He prioritized combating illegal immigration and getting tougher on crime, two issues Trump frequently highlighted as a candidate.\n\nShawn Thew/Pool/Getty Images Attorney General Jeff Sessions (right) resigned from his position Wednesday at the request of President Donald Trump. Here, the two attend a panel discussion on opioid and drug abuse at the White House on March 29, 2017.\n\nSessions is not alone in departing the Trump administration over the Russia scandal. In February 2017, national security adviser Michael Flynn resigned following reports about his conversations with the Russian ambassador. (He later pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI.) Trump has also said that his decision to fire Comey was at least partly due to the probe.\n\nPrior to his brief tenure in the Trump administration, Sessions represented Alabama in the U.S. Senate for two decades. While he was serving as a U.S. attorney in Alabama from 1981 to 1993, the Senate rejected Sessions\u2019 nomination to a federal judgeship over concerns about his comments on race.\n\nThis story has been updated with more details on the resignation and circumstances surrounding it.", "At a heated press conference on Wednesday, President Donald Trump criticized felllow Republicans who failed to \u201cembrace\u201d his support and lost their House seats on Tuesday.

So here goes:\n\nOn bullying\n\nBullying is top of mind for many parents, and for good reason. So what can parents do on a daily basis in their homes to help combat it and raise compassionate kids?\n\nThe key takeaways:\n\n\u2022 Ask meaningful questions. As Stand for the Silent co-founder Kirk Smalley said, \u201cWe as parents need to start asking the hard questions. If you don\u2019t start asking them, you\u2019re going to get the soft answers.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Eat dinner as a family. Even if the family dinner isn\u2019t always calm, just show up and talk about who you admire or things you\u2019ve heard or read that inspire you as a person.\n\n\u2022 Emphasize being a good person and how that\u2019s an important value in your family, said Elizabeth Englander, the director and founder of the Massachusetts Aggression Reduction Center.\n\n\u2022 Read diverse books so kids can see themselves and others in their home library, and encourage your school\u2019s librarian to have diverse books available, said Deborah Pope, the executive director of the Ezra Jack Keats Foundation.\n\n\u2022 Ryan Beale, the founder of Prepare U Mental Health Curriculum, advised, \u201cAsk yourself what you and your partner are doing in your home that you could do better at. Ask how you\u2019re going to lead by example.\u201d\n\nWatch the panel on bullying below.\n\nOn Screen Time\n\nThere was a lot of talk about when to get children a phone (more on that in the coming days), and the one nugget of advice that I found the most applicable came from Jill Murphy, the editor-in-chief of Common Sense Media.\n\n\u201cNarrate what you\u2019re doing when you\u2019re on your phone,\u201d she said. Tell your kids that you\u2019re looking at your phone to view a birthday party invite or to talk to a fellow parent about a playdate or looking at the news. \u201cGive your child insight that it\u2019s not just a phone \u2014 it\u2019s a computer, and this is what it has access to.\u201d\n\nWatch the panel on raising screen savvy kids below.\n\nOn Sex, Consent And Gender\n\nI\u2019m very conscientious about raising my sons to deeply understand bodily autonomy and consent. This panel had some standout conversations not only on consent but also on the challenges of raising gender-questioning and transgender kids. Kim Cavill, a sex educator from Chicago, said something really interesting about consent that struck me as particularly poignant.\n\nShe said, \u201cConsent is really a low bar when we\u2019re talking about sexual relationships and what we as parents inevitably want for our children. Consent is what makes sex legal. It\u2019s not what makes it good. So we can\u2019t just talk about consent and then close the door and feel like we\u2019ve done our job. We\u2019ve just started our job at that point.\u201d\n\nAs writer Carvell Wallace said, \u201cThey\u2019re conversations that can\u2019t be had in a moment. They\u2019re conversations where the door to that conversation has to be open and has to remain open, and your kids have to walk through it when they feel like walking through it, but they\u2019ll only do that if it\u2019s open all the time.\u201d\n\nIn short: Talk, talk and then talk some more.\n\nWatch the sex, consent and gender panel in full below.\n\nOn raising a kid who\u2019s at home in the world\n\nThe final panel of the day centered on raising grounded, compassionate, self-sufficient and resilient kids. It\u2019s a tall order, for sure, but I walked away from it with a real sense of purpose: to really see my two kids.\n\nHere are some of my favorite tidbits of wisdom from the esteemed panel:\n\n\u2022 As Board Certified Licensed Professional Counselor Dr. Tammy Lewis Wilborn eloquently advised, \u201cMake sure your children understand that no matter who they are, no matter who they are not, no matter what the world tells them, that they are enough.\u201d\n\n\u2022 New York state teacher of the year Christopher Albrecht said, \u201cWe need to help children believe in themselves. When people don\u2019t believe in themselves and face adversity, they have fear, and we all know that fear leads to anger. Let\u2019s produce a generation where we help them believe in themselves.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Andrea Beaty \u2014 the author of the beloved children\u2019s books Iggy Peck Architect, Ada Twist Scientist and Rosie Revere Engineer, among others \u2014 said that books are like \u201clittle empathy machines.\u201d She added, \u201cWe tend to think of kids not as real people, but they are real, and they feel everything with all the passion and power and intensity that we feel. Our job is to show them the way forward with that.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Melissa Bernstein, a co-founder of Melissa & Doug toys, advocated for the power of play, arguing that \u201cplay builds more skills than any scheduled activity you could ever imagine.\u201d\n\nWatch the full panel below.\n\nThere is still a lot to digest from this wonderful day, and I\u2019ll be sharing what I\u2019ve learned for years to come.

But he was voting Democratic this time because he didn\u2019t think Donald Trump \u201cshould be the face of our country.\u201d\n\nOver the course of two hours outside a polling place in Brighton, a small Michigan city roughly equidistant between Detroit and Lansing, I heard many more statements similar to that \u2015 like when Mike Blood, managing director at a software company, said he wanted \u201ca bulwark against the current administration,\u201d and when Crystal Straughan, a hairdresser, said, \u201cI don\u2019t think the president is a good example for my child.\u201d\n\nAll of these people said they\u2019d voted for Republicans at points in the past, as did Mary Ann Budd, a horticulturalist. But on Tuesday, she said, \u201cI voted Democratic all the way through and I haven\u2019t done that in years. I\u2019m independent, leaning conservative. There needs to be more balance.\u201d\n\nIt was a lot different from what I\u2019d heard two years ago outside another Michigan polling place \u2015 in Macomb County, the heavily white, middle-class Detroit suburb where the most energized voters were the ones who hated Hillary Clinton. The angry mood was a hint of things to come that night.\n\nI\u2019d picked Brighton for this year\u2019s stakeout in the hopes it would be similarly revealing. The city sits in Michigan\u2019s 8th Congressional District, which Trump carried by 7 percentage points and Mike Bishop, the Republican incumbent, won by even more in 2016. But this time Bishop was running against Democrat Elissa Slotkin, a former CIA officer who had served in Iraq. Her big issue was Bishop\u2019s vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act and its highly popular protections for people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nThe argument over health care \u2015 along with a devastating television ad \u2015 may have made the difference. Slotkin won, with the Wednesday morning tally showing her vote share at 50.8 percent to Bishop\u2019s 46.8 percent, for a margin of roughly 13,000 votes.\n\nSlotkin\u2019s victory was part of a bigger trend, one that was arguably Tuesday\u2019s most important result: Democrats winning back the House of Representatives. As of Wednesday morning, Democrats seemed poised to claim about 230 seats overall, giving them a 25-seat majority, give or take \u2015 more than enough to stop Republican legislation and, no less important, to start Democratic investigations.\n\nThe push to repeal Obamacare by legislation will stop, at least for now. The Trump administration\u2019s management of government, not to mention Trump\u2019s personal and financial conduct, will finally get some congressional scrutiny.\n\nDemocrats made other major gains \u2015 like the election of America\u2019s first openly gay governor in Colorado and the passage of ballot initiatives in three deeply conservative states that will allow 300,000 low-income working adults to get Medicaid. Two years ago, in the wake of Trump\u2019s election, shell-shocked Democrats probably would have cherished such victories.\n\nBut the mood among Democrats and their supporters was pretty mixed as Tuesday slipped into Wednesday.\n\nHow The System Is Still Rigged Against Democrats\n\nPartly the disappointment was a function of losses by a handful of candidates, like Beto O\u2019Rourke, the Texas congressman running for the Senate, in whom Democrats across the country had invested so much emotionally.\n\nPartly it was how the night played out: The first big news came from Florida, where progressives watched one of their heroes, Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, lose his bid to become governor \u2015 even as they saw one of their villains, outgoing governor Rick Scott, move ahead in the vote for U.S. senator. (A recount is now likely in the Senate race.)\n\nBut the setbacks went beyond that.\n\nControl of the U.S. Senate had also been in play this election and, although the polls had suggested for a while that Republicans were likely to retain their majority, many Democrats grasped at encouraging signs \u2015 like shocking early turnout numbers in Texas or a late-breaking media investigation of the Republican Senate candidate in Missouri. In the end, the polls were right and the upset didn\u2019t happen.\n\nRepublicans will actually emerge from the election with a larger majority in the Senate than they had before, ensuring no media narrative about a \u201cblue wave.\u201d But it would have been that kind of wave if votes actually translated more directly to results. Democrats won the national popular vote by more than 7 percentage points, according to the latest data.\n\nThis is the new normal in America, the political minority wielding power that looks more like a majority\u2019s.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret why Democrats nevertheless emerged with fewer Senate seats. The Constitution gives disproportionate power to small states in the upper chamber, which in the current political alignment means conservative-leaning states have extra representation. This is an ongoing problem that will undermine Democrats in the next election just as surely as it did this one.\n\nA similar problem plagues the House, where the incoming Democratic majority is probably smaller than it might have been because of partisan gerrymandering. And the newly elected Democrats who won in Republican-leaning districts like Michigan\u2019s 8th are sure to face difficult challenges winning re-election in two years. As gerrymandering expert Dave Daley told HuffPost recently, \u201cIf it requires a generational wave to give Democrats [the House], that\u2019s a sign of just how powerful gerrymandering is, not a sign that it can be conquered.\u201d\n\nIn 2020, Democrats will have to confront another familiar obstacle: the Electoral College, which also gives smaller states extra power. It\u2019s why Democrats have won the popular vote in five of the last six presidential elections, with the lone loss a relatively small one, but in three of the six elections a Republican went to the White House anyway.\n\nThis is the new normal in America, the political minority wielding power that looks more like a majority\u2019s, and the problem seems likely to get worse as Republicans find more and more ways to protect themselves politically.\n\nSome of the most arresting images from Tuesday showed the long lines in Georgia, where Brian Kemp, the Republican secretary of state who was also the party\u2019s nominee for governor, told a private gathering that Democratic candidate Stacey Abrams\u2019 voter mobilization \u201ccontinues to concern us, especially if everybody uses and exercises their right to vote.\u201d (Kemp was ahead on Wednesday morning, though Georgia was still counting ballots.)\n\nThe Washington Post via Getty Images Long lines at the polls in Georgia on Tuesday were a reminder that voting in many minority communities is difficult, which may have something to do with the Republican state officials in charge.\n\nThat kind of thing was happening all over in the country. In North Dakota, the location of another key contested Senate race, Republicans had implemented a voter identification law that made it more difficult for Native Americans, also thought to lean Democratic, to cast ballots.\n\nThose barriers to voting, like some of the more egregious attempts at partisan gerrymandering, are constitutionally suspect. But Democrats cannot count on federal courts to save them because Republicans are successfully packing the courts with sympathetic judges \u2015 including the U.S. Supreme Court, in no small part because they refused to fill a vacant seat while Barack Obama was still president.\n\nRepublicans have at least one other big advantage going for them and that is the media: They can depend on a slavishly partisan set of publications and networks upon which their followers will rely exclusively \u2015 an ecosystem that has no real analogue on the political left.\n\nIn 2018, that meant Republicans could make up stories about invasions from an immigrant caravan or claim falsely to support protections for people with pre-existing conditions. The strategy didn\u2019t work everywhere, as Mike Bishop can attest, but it probably helped secure at least some of those Senate races.\n\nWhat Democrats Can Do And What They Can\u2019t Do\n\nThe midterms were a stress test for the U.S. system of government \u2015 an experiment in whether a party could pursue a highly unpopular agenda and get away with it. The results were mixed at best. Republicans lost their House majority, yes, but they could have lost bigger, and somehow their Senate majority did grow.\n\nUltimately, some less-heralded victories at the state level may prove more consequential in terms of future elections. In Florida, voters approved a constitutional amendment to automatically re-enfranchise felons who had served their time, with exceptions for convicted murderers and sex offenders. That should give the vote to more than a million Floridians, many of whom committed only minor crimes many years before.\n\nAnd in Michigan, two key political reforms passed at the ballot box. One sets up a bipartisan commission to draw lines for state legislative and congressional districts, in the hopes of ending gerrymandering once and for all. The other enacts a series of reforms, including same-day registration, that will make it easier to vote.\n\nBoth reforms had strong support from the people I met in Brighton, even those who were voting for Republicans. Fairness seems to have at least some bipartisan appeal.\n\nBut the Michigan and Florida measures remain more the exception than the rule. Gerrymandering will persist in other parts of the country, as will voter suppression, and even moderate changes to the Senate (like adding the District of Columbia as a full-voting state) are not possible right now.\n\nAll of that means Democrats have to keep doing what they did over the past two years \u2015 nominating strong candidates, organizing supporters and turning out the vote. A lot of those Senate races were close and demographic trends at least should favor the party over time.", "Voters in California on Tuesday passed a ballot measure mandating more space for certain farm animals and banning the confinement of egg-laying hens in cages.\n\nProposition 12, also known as the Farm Animal Confinement Initiative, also will eventually ban the sale of agricultural products in California that don\u2019t meet the state\u2019s new requirements.

Hens must be kept in cage-free housing providing at least 1 square foot of space per hen.\n\nThe 2022 requirements also mandate that agricultural products sold in California must meet the state\u2019s livestock space requirements, even if they come from out of state.\n\nEnforcement will be up to the California Department of Food and Agriculture and the Department of Public Health, and will be complaint-based, a spokeswoman for the American Society of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals told HuffPost.\n\nFABRIZIO VILLA via Getty Images Hens in battery cages in Italy in 2005.\n\nWhy these specific types of animals?\n\nBattery cages for egg-laying chickens, veal crates for calves, and gestation crates for breeding pigs are some of the most severe forms of animal confinement on modern farms.\n\nBattery cages are rows of small, packed cages that give birds little room. Veal crates are small enclosures that prevent calves from moving around. And gestation crates are used to confine mother pigs for months in cages that, as they grow larger during pregnancy, can leave them virtually immobilized, unable to even lie on their sides.\n\nSome states already have legislation that bans or restricts one or more of these forms of confinement. Many farms elect not to use them.\n\nThe life of a breeding pig is one of extreme confinement, stress and suffering. They spend nearly their entire lives pregnant, confined to a gestation crate where they can\u2019t lie down or turn around. NO animal deserves to suffer this way. \ud83d\udc94 pic.twitter.com/G5EbSAYwYu \u2014 The Humane League (@TheHumaneLeague) March 26, 2018\n\nWho supported Prop 12, and who opposed it?\n\nProposition 12 had strong support from animal protection groups, including prominent organizations like The Humane Society of the United States and the ASPCA. It also gained the support of some consumer advocacy groups.\n\nOpponents included several agricultural industry groups, but also People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. PETA argued that the law did not improve the lives of animals enough, and would lock in inadequate standards that would mislead consumers.\n\nThis sounds really familiar. Did California do something like this before?\n\nYes. In 2008, California voters passed Proposition 2, which also set space requirements for egg-laying hens, veal calves and breeding pigs. However, this law did not establish specific square footage, but instead included language saying that animals must have room to freely move around.\n\nThough supporters intended this law to banish cages for chickens, state officials ultimately ruled that farmers could keep cages as long as they were large enough to comply with the space requirements, according to NPR.\n\nThen, in 2010, state legislators passed a additional bill that prohibited the sale of eggs from other states that didn\u2019t meet those space requirements.\n\nHow could this affect farms in other states?\n\nProp. 12 establishes that out-of-state farms that don\u2019t meet California\u2019s requirements for eggs, veal or pork cannot sell their products there. Though this was already the case for out-of-state egg producers, Prop. 12 makes the space requirements for hens more specific and expressly states that egg-laying hens must be kept in cage-free housing.\n\nMassachusetts passed a similar measure in 2016, set to go into effect in 2022.\n\nCalifornia legislation is the main reason that Rep. Steve King, an Iowa Republican and noted white supremacist, added an amendment to this year\u2019s draft federal farm bill called the Protect Interstate Commerce Act. The addition, also known as the King Amendment, would prohibit states from passing laws affecting the sale of out-of-state agricultural products, as long as out-of-state products comply with federal law or the laws of their own state.", "As someone who\u2019s been in the public eye for decades, Thompson has crossed paths with the royals before and is apparently an old friend of Prince Charles.

Republicans simply did not want to do so. Democrats said in October that they would ask the IRS for Trump\u2019s returns if they regained control of the House, which they did on Tuesday night.\n\nTrump said Wednesday that he would hand over his tax returns if he weren\u2019t being audited \u2015 an excuse he has made since his 2016 campaign, even though nothing about an IRS audit prevents a candidate or a president from disclosing his returns.\n\n\u201cIf I were finished with the audit, I would have an open mind to it,\u201d he said Wednesday in a rambling answer to a reporter\u2019s question.\n\nFederal law gives congressional tax committees the power to obtain anyone\u2019s tax returns.

Jon Tester defeated Republican Matt Rosendale in Tuesday\u2019s Montana U.S. Senate race despite a blizzard of attacks from Donald Trump and his allies \u2015 an impressive feat in a state the president carried by 20 percentage points in the 2016 election.\n\nTester was one of the Democratic Party\u2019s most vulnerable incumbents this year, but he surprised progressives with his frequent opposition to Trump\u2019s executive and judicial branch nominees. He voted against the appointments of Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, for example. He opposed Gina Haspel, Trump\u2019s controversial choice to lead the CIA. He also voted against both of Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominees, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nWhat Trump resented most, however, was the senator\u2019s role in derailing the nomination of former White House physician Ronny Jackson to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs. Jackson withdrew his bid earlier this year over allegations that he oversaw a toxic work environment, overprescribed medication and drank while on the job. Tester, the senior Democrat on the Senate Veterans\u2019 Affairs Committee, made enough noise about the allegations that even some top Republicans on the panel sided with him against the president.\n\nWilliam Campbell via Getty Images Jon Tester won re-election to his U.S. Senate seat in Montana.\n\n\u201cHe behaved worse than the Democrat Mob did with Justice K!\u201d Trump complained last month on Twitter, comparing Tester\u2019s opposition to Jackson to the protests against Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination.\n\nRepublicans hoped that Tester\u2019s opposition to Jackson would hurt the senator\u2019s standing in Montana, a state that has one of the highest rates per capita of military veterans in the United States. The strategy never quite took off, however. Tester\u2019s success at building his own brand, and his efforts to portray himself as a bipartisan voice who isn\u2019t afraid to work with the GOP, translated into a comfortable polling lead throughout much of the race.\n\nTester, a farmer who as a child lost three fingers on his left hand in a meat grinder accident, started in politics as a local school board member. After two terms as a state senator, in 2006 he won his U.S. Senate seat by knocking off a longtime GOP incumbent. Six years later, he won re-election by 4 percentage points as Republican Mitt Romney carried Montana in the 2012 presidential race by more than 13 points.\n\nRosendale, the Montana state auditor, sold himself as a political outsider in the mold of Trump. He attacked Tester over his votes against the president\u2019s policies and nominees, but he suffered from attacks labeling him as a carpetbagger.

It was a very strong night for Democrats in Minnesota.\u201d\n\nHutchinson\u2019s campaign had adopted a progressive approach to race, focusing on increasing transparency within Minnesota\u2019s law enforcement and embracing immigrant communities throughout the state.

It won 69 percent approval.\n\nFlorida is home to 11 of the nation\u2019s 17 remaining greyhound racing tracks, according to the Humane Society of the United States, which supported the measure.\n\n\u201cFlorida voters have delivered a knock-out blow to a cruel industry that has been hurting and killing dogs for nearly a century,\u201d the Committee to Protect Dogs, which also supported the ban, said in a statement.\n\nActivists say greyhounds are bred for suffering, living in small cages and trained for racing that frequently leads to broken legs and backs. Some racers have even fed their dogs cocaine in an attempt to make the already lithe animals win more races.\n\nNearly 500 greyhounds have died as a result of racing in Florida since the state began tracking such numbers in 2013.\n\nCommercial dog racing is illegal in 40 states. Only one other \u2015 aside from Florida \u2015 has passed a voter referendum explicitly outlawing the practice, according to the pro-racing National Greyhound Association.\n\nAmong the measure\u2019s other opponents were several conservative groups, the Florida Farm Bureau and the American Kennel Club, which \u201cencourages and strongly supports the interaction and mutual enjoyment of owners and dogs in sporting activities\u201d including hunting, herding and \u201cagility trials.\u201d The AKC claimed that animal abuse regulations were enough to combat abuses in the sport.\n\nThe National Rifle Association also opposed the ban. The gun group\u2019s top lobbyist in Florida accused animal rights activists of using the measure as \u201ca front\u201d to go after hunting and fishing practices.\n\nLara Trump, President Donald Trump\u2019s daughter-in-law who heads his 2020 campaign, came out in favor of the ban, telling The Palm Beach Post this week that it would save dogs from \u201cdeplorable conditions.\u201d", "Would you still buy sausages if they cost more than twice as much? What about ham or bacon? As evidence mounts up about the serious health implications of eating red and processed meats, including increased risk of cancer, researchers are calling for a meat tax.\n\nThe idea, set out in research from the University of Oxford published on Tuesday, is that a meat tax could both reduce deaths and raise the money needed to cover the health costs of our consumption.\n\n\u201cIf something is classified as carcinogenic, there is rationale for governments to regulate that, minimizing risk exposure to citizens, that\u2019s one of the responsibilities of governments,\u201d Marco Springmann of the University of Oxford told HuffPost.\n\nGovernments around the world already use taxes to discourage what are considered harmful behaviors, such as smoking, using single-use plastic bags or drinking sweetened drinks. Could meat be added to the list?\n\nHere we take a look at the reasons for a meat tax, how it would work and whether it could be implemented.\n\nWhat\u2019s wrong with eating meat?\n\nIt depends what type of meat you\u2019re eating. Eating meat does have health benefits, but we\u2019re eating too much of it. And the wrong kind.\n\nWhen it comes to red meat and processed meat, there is increasing evidence that eating too much of it can have pretty heavy health consequences.\n\nRed meat \u2014 which includes beef, lamb and pork \u2014 has been labeled by the World Health Organzation as \u201cprobably carcinogenic\u201d for humans. Processed meat \u2014 for example, hot dogs, ham and sausages \u2014 is deemed carcinogenic. In other words, there is \u201cconvincing evidence\u201d it causes cancer, according to the WHO.\n\nizikMd via Getty Images Processed meats such as sausages have been linked to cancer.\n\nWhile statistics are hard to come by for red meats, about 34,000 cancer deaths a year are attributable to diets heavy in processed meats, according to the Global Burden of Disease project. The most common type of cancer associated with these types of meat is colorectal cancer, but it\u2019s also been linked to heart disease, diabetes and strokes.\n\nAccording to the new study, by 2020 there will be 2.4 million deaths attributable to eating red and processed meats.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s not just about health. Meat has a huge environmental footprint too. Livestock accounts for 14.5 percent of human-related greenhouse gas emissions and recent research from the journal Science suggested that the best thing you can do for the planet is to stop eating meat and dairy.\n\nHow much would it be?\n\nThe researchers analyzed 149 countries to calculate how much extra we should be paying for meat, if we want to pay the true cost. And it\u2019s quite staggering.\n\nTo cover the health costs, processed meats should cost 25 percent more on average. In lower income countries, prices would only need to rise by 1 percent, the study says, but in richer countries, it recommends price increases of more than 100 percent. Average prices for red meat would increase by 4 percent.\n\nIn the U.S. the taxes would be high, with 163 percent on processed meat and just under 34 percent on red meat.\n\nWhat could be the outcome?\n\nThe research suggests that it could prevent more than 220,000 deaths and save $40 billion in health care costs every year. They estimate tax revenues could cover 70 percent of the costs spent by countries on dealing with the health implications of these types of meat.\n\nIn terms of environmental impact, Springmann said their analysis found that global taxation of red and processed meats at the level they suggest could reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by more than 100 megatons, \u201cso that\u2019s comparable to technological mitigation measures that have been looked at.\u201d\n\nWon\u2019t this hit low-income people hardest?\n\nThat\u2019s the criticism. Making food more expensive for everyone will obviously have the most negative impact on those with the least to spend. Often processed meats can be the lowest-price option for low-income families looking for cheap sources of protein. And some studies have suggested there is a cost to eating more healthily.\n\nBut Springmann counters this by drawing a comparison to soda taxes, \u201cWhat people have found with the sugar drinks tax, it would actually help low income-households more because they would have a higher incentive of switching to other, more healthy alternatives.\u201d\n\nBaloncici via Getty Images\n\nHe says the tax needs to be complemented by information campaigns and other initiatives such as cooking classes that show it\u2019s easy and affordable to switch diets. \u201cMost of the time people don\u2019t know what they should consume instead. So it\u2019s very important to show them what are the alternatives.\u201d\n\nHas anyone done it?\n\nYes. Denmark implemented a tax on saturated fats in 2011, which can be seen as a meat tax in effect, as meat is high in saturated fats. But, after a backlash, it was abolished after a year.\n\nResearch published in Nature found that, during its short life, it did encourage healthier eating. The tax resulted in a 4 percent reduction in saturated fat intake and an increase in vegetable consumption. It has a fairly lukewarm conclusion that the tax \u201cmade a positive, but minor, contribution to public health in Denmark.\u201d\n\nSpringmann said the lesson to be learned from this case study is \u201cthat it\u2019s really important to communicate it well.\u201d If people understand what revenues are used for, he says, the tax is viewed more positively. In Springmann\u2019s study, meat tax revenues would be used to cover health costs, but they could equally be used to support farmers and butchers in making a shift away from meat, or to subsidize fruit and vegetables.\n\nWhat\u2019s the likelihood of it being implemented in the U.S.?\n\nAt the moment, low. The closest thing to a meat tax in existence in parts of the U.S. may well be soda taxes. Philadelphia, Seattle and Boulder are among the cities to introduce taxes on sugary drinks. But it\u2019s not a federal policy and has seen very strong pushback from soda companies. During the midterms, $20 million was raised in Washington state alone to support a ballot proposition that would bar cities from passing any new taxes on \u201cgrocery items.\u201d Soda companies such as Coca-Cola and Pepsico contributed 98 percent.\n\nAny meat tax would face extremely strong opposition from farming lobbies. And the current administration is not exactly keen on taxes.", "Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), an ultraconservative whose re-election campaign was dogged by accusations that he ignored sexual abuse while he was an assistant coach at Ohio State University, on Wednesday announced his bid for House minority leader.\n\nHours after his midterm election victory for a seventh term representing Ohio\u2019s 4th Congressional District \u2015 and after Democrats won control of the House \u2015 Jordan told The Hill that he\u2019ll challenge Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) for the leadership spot.\n\n\u201cI plan to run for minority leader,\u201d said Jordan. \u201cIn 2016, the American people elected Republicans to come here and change this town.

Have we secured the border yet? Have we reformed welfare yet? No.\u201d\n\nJordan was publicly accused in July of inaction at Ohio State while the team doctor sexually abused dozens of athletes in the late 1980s and early \u201990s. At least 145 people have accused Dr. Richard Strauss, who died by suicide in 2005, of sexual assault.\n\nJordan has repeatedly denied he knew about Strauss\u2019s actions, but a former OSU athlete, Dunyasha Yetts, told NBC News in July that he personally told Jordan that Strauss attempted to pull down his shorts during what was supposed to be an examination of his thumb.\n\nJordan was on the defensive right up until Election Day. In August, it was reported that an ex-coach asked Jordan\u2019s accusers to walk back their accusations just a day after they went public. Russ Hellickson reportedly sent messages to at least two former wrestlers, including Yetts, offering to rewrite their stories.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry you got caught up in the media train,\u201d Hellickson wrote to Yetts in a text obtained by NBC News. \u201cIf you think the story got told wrong about Jim, you could probably write a statement for release that tells your story and corrects what you feel bad about.

Other than a plot that is said to \u201cfollow the escape of a kidnapped man and his quest for freedom,\u201d THR noted that it was unclear whether the two-hour work was intended for TV or the cinema, whether it was a sequel or prequel (such as AMC\u2019s \u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d), or whether the original stars, Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul, would be involved.\n\nCranston\u2019s meth-making Walter White appear to have died in the Emmy-winning show\u2019s 2013 finale, but the actor joked recently that things may not be as they seemed.\n\nThe New Mexico Film Office confirmed that a movie called \u201cGreenbrier,\u201d said to be the title, will begin production in Albuquerque mid-November through early February, the Albuquerque Journal reported.

Oregon voters rejected a ballot measure that would have ended the state\u2019s \u201csanctuary\u201d policies. Kansas gubernatorial candidate Kris Kobach, a Republican who has spent years pushing hard-line immigration policies around the country, lost. So did Pennsylvania U.S. Senate candidate Lou Barletta, who enacted an anti-immigrant policy years before as a mayor and recently defended separating families at the border. Several other Republicans who campaigned on immigration crackdowns lost too, which immigrant rights advocates held up as proof that Trump\u2019s fear-based campaigning wasn\u2019t the guaranteed winner he seemed to think it was.\n\nAnd now that Democrats have taken control of the House, they can serve as a check on Trump\u2019s immigration efforts.\n\nDemocrats are expected to launch investigations and conduct oversight on a number of Trump actions and policies \u2015 something Republicans have so far declined to do. And immigrant rights groups will be pressing them to do so.\n\nTyler Moran, managing director of progressive group The Immigration Hub and a former Senate and White House staffer, pointed out several areas ripe for oversight. Those include the Trump administration\u2019s family separations at the border, its deportation tactics, and its decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program for young undocumented immigrants and temporary protected status for certain nationalities of immigrants whose home countries suffered natural disasters or violence.\n\nDems taking the House = DHS oversight on family separation, ending DACA, ending TPS for 300,000 people, border patrol checkpoints stopping ambulances w/sick children, arresting DV victims at courthouses, excessive use of force, shacking pregnant women, targeting families.... \u2014 Tyler Moran (@tyler_t_moran) November 7, 2018\n\nMany of Trump\u2019s immigration policies also require significant funding increases \u2015 something a Democratic House is likely to fight. The Democrats have already vowed not to fund Trump\u2019s wall along the southern border. Trump is expected to push for wall funding during the lame duck session while Republicans maintain control of both chambers, and has suggested a government shutdown in December if he doesn\u2019t get what he wants.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) told The Wall Street Journal ahead of the election that if Democrats should win a majority on Tuesday, they\u2019d have more leverage to block wall spending even before they officially take over.\n\n\u201cWhy would we compromise on the wall now?\u201d she said.\n\nBloomberg Current House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has pushed for more protections for undocumented immigrants.\n\nMass detention of families and asylum-seekers, which Trump is pushing for through a proposed rule change and a potential executive order, would also have a hefty price tag. Most Democrats oppose such policies.\n\nDemocrats are also likely to push legislation that protects undocumented immigrants, particularly young immigrants, which could increase public pressure for Senate Republicans and Trump to back it.\n\nTrump ended the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, last year, but so far has been forced to keep it running by court orders that he is continuing to fight. Although Republicans opposed DACA, some have voiced support for some type of legislative measure that would keep its recipients \u2015 so-called Dreamers who have lived in the U.S. since childhood \u2015 from being deported.\n\nBut so far, Republicans haven\u2019t actually supported measures that would do so, at least without simultaneously aiming to restrict legal immigration and ramp up deportation efforts.\n\nImmigrant rights groups want a \u201cclean\u201d bill for Dreamers, called the Dream Act, that doesn\u2019t include other measures. Democrats are expected to push for it, but past stalemates are likely to continue. More likely, Democrats could make a deal to protect Dreamers while also giving Trump something he wants, but not the whole spate of anti-immigrant measures Republicans tried, and failed, to pass earlier this year.\n\nWhile Democrats gaining the majority was a good thing for supporters of immigrant rights, it required knocking out some moderate Republicans who could previously be claimed as allies on bipartisan legislation. Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.), who unsuccessfully pushed for protections for undocumented young people, lost to a Democrat. So did Rep. Mike Coffman (R-Colo.), another Republican who called for legal status for Dreamers, although he spoke in more hawkish terms at an August fundraiser.\n\nThe defeat of bipartisan backers may be more of a symbolic loss than a substantive one. The Democrats who will take their place are likely to be even more reliable supporters of immigration reform.\n\nLeading immigrant rights advocates, including Frank Sharry of America\u2019s Voice, cheered Coffman\u2019s defeat.", "Ariana Grande performs \"thank u, next\" on \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show.\"\n\nAriana Grande\u2019s debut performance of \u201cthank u, next,\u201d her breakup anthem that succeeds at being both petty and empowering, was a pretty fine reflection of her life of late.\n\nThere were some bumps and maybe even a few tears, but she persisted (and managed to find the fun), serving some on-point vocals as always.\n\nThe \u201cSweetner\u201d singer took the stage on \u201cThe Ellen DeGeneres Show\u201d this week in her first appearance since breaking off her engagement with \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d star Pete Davidson and the sudden death of her ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, from a drug overdose.\n\nGrande chose to channel the classic musical number from \u201cThe First Wives Club,\u201d wearing bridal white alongside her two backup singers to resemble the film\u2019s stars Bette Midler, Goldie Hawn and Dianne Keaton.\n\nBut she ran into some trouble dancing around the set, which was made to look like a wedding reception, stumbling when she stepped down from a chair.\n\n\u201cOh, my god!\u201d Grande shouted as she recovered from the fall, then almost seamlessly continued performing.\n\n\u201cThis one gon\u2019 last / \u2019Cause her name is Ari / And I\u2019m so good with that,\u201d she sang without missing a note, adding a self-deprecating chuckle.\n\nShe moved into more emotional territory as the song progressed, holding back tears while singing about her future wedding day.\n\n\u201cOne day I\u2019ll walk down the aisle / Holding hands with my mama / I\u2019ll be thanking my dad / \u2018Cause she grew from the drama,\u201d she sang. \u201cOnly wanna do it once, real bad / Gon\u2019 make that shit last / God forbid something happens / Least this song is a smash.\u201d\n\nBut, just as the song says, Grande knows how to handle the pain.

President Donald Trump won Montana by 21 points in 2016; a Republican has occupied Montana\u2019s at-large seat since 1994.\n\nIn the end, the congressman\u2019s biggest hurdle to re-election was likely his own reputation. Just one day before he narrowly won the 2017 special election to replace former Rep. Ryan Zinke, whom Trump had tapped as interior secretary, Gianforte physically attacked The Guardian\u2019s Ben Jacobs in response to a routine question about health policy.\n\nThe congressman pleaded guilty to the charge, receiving a six-month deferred sentence including community service and mandatory anger management counseling. Gianforte and his legal team attempted to excuse him from having to appear for fingerprints and a mug shot \u2015 an attempt that ultimately failed:\n\nTrump praised Gianforte for the violence while stumping for the congressman.\n\nWith Williams reminding voters of the criminal act in her campaign ads, Gianforte began sharing a different version of the assault at rallies \u2015 one in which Jacobs initiated a physical exchange, not Gianforte.

In the most recent report available, about 437,000 children were in foster care in 2017, while about 117,000 children were waiting to be adopted. Meanwhile, about 57,000 children were adopted from foster care that year.\n\nWe interviewed Emily McCombs, deputy editor of HuffPost Personal, about what it was like to welcome her son into her home after adopting him through New York\u2019s foster care system.\n\nWe also have data from a survey by Adoptive Families magazine about the average cost of a private adoption in the U.S., and we spoke to Katie Stickles-Wynen, a transracial adoption specialist at the private adoption agency Pact, an adoption alliance, as well as her colleague Malaika Parker, director of the adoptive parents of color collaborative at the agency.\n\nStickles-Wynen was born in Colombia and adopted by parents in the U.S., while Parker experienced infertility before adopting her two children and then going on to give birth to two more children.\n\nWhen it comes to the question, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just adopt,\u201d Parker pointed out that people who are blind advocates for adoption are only able to do so because they have a limited perspective that focuses solely on the adoptive parents\u2019 experience, while leaving out the fact that most times, relinquishment is a major trauma for both birth parents and their children.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t take into consideration the children\u2019s experience, they don\u2019t take into consideration the loss from the communities when the children leave, [or] the impact on their parents by birth,\u201d Parker said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s very much focused on families who are infertile.\u201d\n\nAnd if infertile couples approach the adoption process with this same limited mindset, they may inadvertently inflict harm on the very people they\u2019re trying to love and care for, said Parker.\n\n\u201cThese are human people. They do not exist to provide us with whatever we want,\u201d Parker said about adopted children. \u201cWe don\u2019t get to alleviate our pain by inflicting or perpetuating pain on entire communities.\u201d\n\nParker\u2019s advice for infertile couples is to give themselves time and space to grieve what they\u2019ve lost before pursuing adoption. While adoption is a social good, and something positive for children who need families and homes, infertile people may short-change their own experiences by fast-tracking their adoption process.\n\n\u201cA lot of folks that come to adoption, come to adoption after a huge loss themselves,\u201d Parker said, whether it be infertility, lack of a partner or a late decision to parent. \u201cThings look different from the picture they assumed for themselves. And they need time to grieve that, too.\u201d", "Supreeya Chantalao / EyeEm via Getty Images\n\nYou\u2019re hitting the gym on a regular basis and doing your best to eat green salads in lieu of cheeseburgers, yet your pant size is relatively remaining the same. What gives?\n\nIf you\u2019ve been finding it difficult to lose weight lately, there\u2019s probably an explanation \u2015 and, most importantly, a solution. There are a few key steps that you can take that can get you on the path to achieving your health goals.\n\nBelow is a breakdown of why you might be hitting a plateau as well as expert advice on how to troubleshoot any issues.\n\n1. You are losing weight \u2014 it\u2019s just happening slowly.\n\nAccording to Lisa D. Ellis, a nutrition therapist in White Plains, New York, there is a false notion that a successful diet will have someone dropping something like 10 pounds a month. For most people, that is an unrealistic standard.\n\n\u201cI point out to my clients that shedding just a half pound a week ends up as a total loss of 26 pounds a year,\u201d she said.\n\nEllis added that losing at a slower pace is also a safe way to ensure that your weight loss sticks. \u201cA half-pound a week is a rate that won\u2019t cause a person\u2019s body to sense the weight loss as famine,\u201d she said, noting that when a body senses a famine, it tries to regain the weight when the perceived famine is over, which is one reason why people regain weight at the end of a crash diet.\n\n2. You aren\u2019t drinking enough water.\n\nEugenio Marongiu via Getty Images\n\nMichael Jay Nusbaum, surgical director of the metabolic medicine and weight control center for Atlantic Health and chief of bariatric surgery at Morristown Medical Center, said that you cannot burn fat if your body is dehydrated.\n\n\u201cThe process of burning fat is very expensive water-wise. You need to be drinking more than 48 ounces of fluid per day,\u201d he said, adding that if you notice that your stool is hard or that you\u2019re constipated and unable to move your bowels easily, \u201cthen your body is telling you loud and clear that you are dehydrated.\u201d\n\n3. You are not sleeping enough.\n\nGet those Zzzs. Your brain and body will thank you for it.\n\n\u201cAny time we sleep for less than seven hours, our metabolism slows down,\u201d said Craig Primack, an obesity medicine physician in Scottsdale, Arizona. \u201cOne study showed that the same person burned 400 fewer calories when they slept for five and a half hours vs. eight and a half hours.\u201d\n\n4. Your medication may be to blame.\n\nTowfiqu Photography via Getty Images\n\nPrimack said that certain medications \u2015 such as those for blood pressure, diabetes and depression \u2015 can not only slow down weight loss, but may also foster weight gain. But that doesn\u2019t mean that you should ditch them: Talk to your doctor first.\n\n\u201cFor our patients looking to lose weight, we try to talk to their primary care physicians to see if there may be a good alternative to these medications. If there is not, we work to implement low-carbohydrate and low-calorie diets to override the weight implications of those medicines,\u201d he said.\n\n5. You eat healthy sometimes.\n\n\u201cA lot of the reason people have a hard time losing weight initially is they aren\u2019t completely committed to the process. They are always quasi-dieting,\u201d said Erin Wathen, a certified life and weight loss coach and author of the upcoming book Why Can\u2019t I Stick to My Diet? \u201cFor example, during the weekdays, they are good. On the weekends, not so much.\u201d\n\nIn order to make a serious dent in your weight loss plan, Wathen recommended trading in the concept of a short-lived diet for a healthy lifestyle change.\n\n\u201cFully commit to making lasting change \u2015 not until the reunion, the wedding or until you reach the magic number and then you can eat how you have always wanted,\u201d she said.\n\n6. Your workout may no longer be challenging your body.\n\nWestend61 via Getty Images\n\n\u201cWeight loss plateaus are also quite common and happen when someone has lost a certain amount of weight but the body levels out,\u201d said Justin Blum, CEO and owner of the Raw Fitness Franchise. \u201cIf this happens, switch up your routine to incorporate other types of activities you are not currently doing.\u201d\n\nIf all you\u2019ve been doing is hitting the elliptical, for instance, try adding strength training, sprints, high-intensity interval training or trying new fitness classes throughout the week to \u201cjumpstart your body again,\u201d Blum said.\n\n7. You\u2019re stressed.\n\nBlum said stress can play a major role in weight loss, especially chronic stress because it \u201cmakes your body believe it\u2019s using calories to deal with stress and makes you \u2018hungry\u2019 because your body thinks you need to replenish them when you don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nBlum added that cortisol and comfort food the biggest culprits when it comes to stress causing weight gain and preventing weight loss.\n\n\u201cStress management is just as important as following a diet plan, but the good news is exercise is one of the greatest ways to combat chronic stress,\u201d he said.\n\n8. You\u2019re prioritizing exercise over nutrition.\n\nd3sign via Getty Images\n\nYou can put in hours at the gym, but if you aren\u2019t eating well enough, then you may not be experiencing the weight loss that you desire.\n\n\u201cPeople often believe that if they just exercise more, they will lose weight. However, weight loss and healthy weight maintenance boils down to 75 to 80 percent nutrition and only 20 to 25 percent physical activity and exercise,\u201d said Molly Devine, a licensed dietitian/nutritionist and founder of Eat Your Keto. \u201cSo if your nutrition isn\u2019t on point, it doesn\u2019t matter how often or how hard you work out, the weight loss may not come.\u201d\n\n9. You\u2019re not keeping track of how much you are eating.\n\nA few chips, a fistful of nuts and several crackers can really make a difference if you\u2019re consuming them daily.\n\n\u201cOften, people grossly underestimate how much they really eat in a day. They may not count liquid calories or tasting food, or the mid-afternoon snack. Little things that really do add up,\u201d said Pam Sherman, a certified trainer and founder of The Perfect Balance. She suggested logging your meals into a tool like MyFitnessPal or Lose it! to keep track.\n\n10. You\u2019re not accounting for alcohol.\n\nThomas Barwick via Getty Images\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to have a drinking problem for alcohol to be holding you back from your ultimate weight loss goals. It\u2019s pretty sneaky how it affects our metabolism and most diets don\u2019t usually instruct to cut out alcohol,\u201d said Karolina Rzadkowolska, founder of Euphoric Alcohol-Free, a space that empowers people to find freedom from alcohol for happier and healthier lives.\n\nAccording to Rzadkowolska, alcoholic drinks can pack on empty calories. \u201cOne glass of wine has between 150-200 calories. A beer clocks in between 100-200. And some heavy IPAs can be 300 calories,\u201d she said.\n\nRzadkowolska added that alcohol can also increase your appetite and lead to unplanned snacking. (Hello, drunk munchies!)\n\n11. It may be an underlying medical issue.\n\nIf you\u2019re making the right lifestyle choices and you\u2019re still having trouble, you might be experiencing an underlying issue, said Jill Brown, a health and nutrition coach and fitness trainer in Los Angeles. In her experience, this could mean that something is slowing down your metabolism or you could be experiencing a hormonal imbalance.\n\n\u201cA sluggish thyroid or low estrogen levels can cause this, for example. Quite simply, you need to be burning more calories than you\u2019re consuming and if your metabolism has slowed down, you may want to find out why,\u201d she said.\n\n12. You could have a nutritional deficiency.\n\nJaromir Chalabala / EyeEm via Getty Images\n\n\u201cI would say that one often overlooked cause of trouble losing weight is vitamin deficiencies,\u201d said Arielle Levitan, an internal medicine physician and co-founder Vous Vitamin LLC.\n\nStudies suggest, for instance, that vitamin D deficiency may be linked to obesity and that people with vitamin D deficiency have a harder time losing weight.\n\n\u201cIn addition, we find that repleting certain other key vitamin deficiencies such as iron, B12 and magnesium can allow people to feel better, more energetic and as a result, have an easier time living a healthy lifestyle which includes exercise, adequate sleep and thoughtful meal planning,\u201d Levitan said.\n\n13. You\u2019re not eating enough protein.\n\nStudies have shown people feel fuller longer and consume less calories over time when they eat more protein.\n\n\u201cYour body digests protein slower than any other macronutrient, which means your blood sugar and hunger don\u2019t spike, so you\u2019re less likely to overeat,\u201d said Greg Pignataro, a certified strength and conditioning specialist.", "Twelve years after first appearing on the political stage as an upstart liberal insurgent, Democrat Ned Lamont won the election on Tuesday to be Connecticut\u2019s next governor. He defeated Republican candidate Bob Stefanowski.\n\nLamont, a wealthy businessman who spent $12 million of his own fortune on the election, won a closely fought race that revolved around taxes, health care and the state\u2019s falling population and lack of job creation.\n\nLamon prevailed despite the unpopularity of outgoing Democratic Gov. Dan Malloy, which was an anchor dragging him down. Malloy\u2019s unpopularity stems from his passage of the state\u2019s largest tax increase in 2011 and, despite that tax increase, continued government budget cuts. Meanwhile, the state has seen an incredibly unequal recovery from the Great Recession, with its many wealthy residents recouping their losses while the middle class and poor have suffered amid a climate of stagnant job growth.\n\nLamont first shot into political stardom in 2006 when he challenged then-Sen. Joe Lieberman in a Democratic Party primary election from the left. Lamont ran specifically against Lieberman\u2019s vote to give President George W. Bush the authority to invade Iraq. His campaign was backed by bloggers known as the Netroots, who advocated for pushing the Democratic Party further to the left. He defeated Lieberman in the primary, but the former vice presidential nominee quit the Democratic Party and won re-election as an independent on the Connecticut for Lieberman Party line.", "Swiftly, our most potentially consequential midterm election became a dramatic reaffirmation Tuesday of our widening political divide.\n\nIn the House, among 75 competitive races identified by the Cook Report, Democrats needed to gain only 23 seats to seize control. But the early defeat of military veteran Amy McGrath in the tossup Kentucky 6th signaled the absence of a blue tsunami.\n\nIn a Senate that gives modestly populated red states disproportionate representation, Democrats were defending too many vulnerable seats in states carried by Donald Trump. GOP challengers turfed Democratic incumbents in North Dakota, Indiana, Missouri and Florida, meaning Trump is assured of a compliant Senate stripped of Republican moderates \u2015 though, in defeat, the uniquely talented Beto O\u2019Rourke became a national figure by waging a campaign that may mark a turning point in Texas politics.\n\nAmong the gubernatorial races, there were toss-ups in 10 states held by Republicans. But the defeats of Andrew Gillum and, likely, Stacey Abrams thwarted Democratic hopes for transcendently transformative wins.\n\nStill, by the end of the night, a scattering of Democrats in swing districts from coast to coast had given the party a redemptive victory \u2015 enough seats to gain a clear majority that secures the House as a bulwark against Trump\u2019s excesses.\n\nWhat does all this augur for our electorate \u2015 and our politics between now and 2020?\n\nFirst, the House. The Democrats\u2019 narrow takeover captures the party\u2019s demographic gains \u2015 and their limits. In most of America, Trump\u2019s polarizing presidency cemented the bases of both parties, widening the now familiar geographic and social divides between people of color, the young and the better educated, particularly women; and the older, frequently less prosperous and modestly educated whites who often include conservative evangelicals.\n\nThe one-sided composition of most House districts underscores the Democrats\u2019 structural challenges. It appears that Democrats won the national popular vote in House races by more than 9 percent. But gerrymandering and demographic sorting mean that most voters of color, and many of the young, are packed into heavily Democratic urban districts. Instead of a blue wave, there was only a partial realignment among the party\u2019s immediate target of opportunity: well-educated and prosperous whites in suburban swing districts.\n\nHere Donald Trump was a gift, putting paid to his reputation for uncanny political reflexes. Any politician who could survive psychological testing would have run on rising prosperity and employment, throwing in the containment of ISIS. But Trump\u2019s strategy was rooted in personal pathology: Instead of taking credit for the economy, he doubled down on racial animus \u2015 because it arouses the cacophony of rapture he craves at the rallies that fill the yawning void within.\n\nBloomberg via Getty Images Beto O'Rourke's loss to Sen. Ted Cruz in Texas was one of the high-profile races that eluded Democrats. But the close margin offers a blueprint to make the state more competitive in future cycles.\n\nTrump\u2019s \u201cstrategy\u201d merged with his personal and psychological preferences: To drive his followers to the polls, thereby building a wall around red America, he invoked white identity politics in ways formerly beneath any American president. He characterized a desperate stream of Latino refugees fleeing terrible hardship as an \u201cinvasion\u201d filled with gang members and Arab terrorists bent on overrunning our country. He abused his authority as commander in chief to deploy American soldiers along the border, suggesting they might be called on to shoot rock-throwing migrants.\n\nIn defiance of the Constitution, he proposed to terminate birthright citizenship. Among his more spectacular lies was the assertion that an illegal immigrant who murdered a policeman had been let in by Democrats. In the spirit of pan-racial disparagement, he characterized Gillum and Abrams as, respectively, \u201cnot equipped\u201d and \u201cnot qualified.\u201d\n\nAs their leader\u2019s racism grew ever more overt, Republican candidates remained supportive or stifled. Along the way, Trump and his party told lies too blatant for vigilant voters. He touted a phantom bill providing a middle-class tax cut \u2015 whereupon congressional Republicans pretended it was real. In this political fantasyland, Republicans even claimed to champion people with pre-existing conditions. If their real positions were unpopular, they apparently reasoned, why not emulate Trump by lying?\n\nKansas City Star via Getty Images Sharice Davids of Kansas was one of more than 30 Democrats on Tuesday to win a House seat formerly held by a Republican. She will be one of the first Native American women to serve in Congress.\n\nIn short, Trump persuaded a pivotal slice of the electorate that he is irredeemably repulsive \u2015 and that his party is morally anemic. But within his base, white identity politics seemed to stimulate turnout against Gillum, Abrams and Democrats in general, suggesting that Trump and the GOP will continue to use race as a wedge issue among the electorate at large.\n\nStill, other factors that helped flip the House will likely serve Democrats going forward. Whatever else, the GOP\u2019s feral defense of the belligerent and entitled Brett Kavanaugh, and Trump\u2019s mockery of Christine Blasey Ford, seemed to further repel many suburban women drawn to a record number of capable female candidates. Military veterans with progressive values \u2015 a diverse group that includes women and people of color \u2015 provided an example of patriotism more inclusive than Trump\u2019s sulfurous attacks on black athletes who kneel during the national anthem. Millennials, buffeted by student loans, a tough job market and the spectacle of young people slaughtered with guns, began turning out to vote against a party where racial and social intolerance meets environmental destruction.\n\nWhat to expect from a Democratic House? To start, Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) will likely become speaker again, albeit as a transitional leader who offers the skill and experience needed to steer a narrow majority of Democrats through two years of conflict with Trump and the Senate while passing an agenda that lays down a marker for 2020.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) celebrated the retaking of the House majority Tuesday night. She appears poised to retake the role of speaker of the House.\n\nThat includes a package of reforms designed to fortify voting rights and curb corruption: restoring provisions of the Voting Rights Act gutted by the Supreme Court; providing for automatic voter registration; instituting nonpartisan commissions to redraw congressional districts; requiring political action committees to disclose their donors; and stiffening ethics requirements for elected officials. Other measures will address issues as to which Trump has spoken favorably, if vaguely: investing in infrastructure, controlling the cost of prescription drugs, enforcing background checks on gun sales, and securing legal status for Dreamers \u2015 as well as protecting LGBTQ Americans against discrimination.\n\nNone of this will become law in the form proposed by Democrats. All will help define the party\u2019s agenda for 2020. More urgently, the House can now be expected to block the worst legislative initiatives of the Republican Senate: cutting Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security to pay for budget-busting tax cuts that benefit Republican donors, and repealing Obamacare in full.\n\nThere is nothing House Democrats can do to stop the Republican Senate, which has exclusive control over judicial nominations, from accelerating Trump and his party\u2019s campaign to transform the federal judiciary by confirming conservative ideologues who represent the GOP\u2019s political interests. But the House, at whatever risk, can explore whether now-Justice Kavanaugh lied during his confirmation hearings about his involvement in a teenage drinking culture attested to by Dr. Ford, or about his involvement in controversial decisions during the George W. Bush administration \u2015 and whether Trump and his appointees sought to limit the FBI\u2019s supplemental investigation of Kavanaugh in order to suppress the truth.\n\nMore profitably, House Democrats can probe the actions of Trump\u2019s administration in suppressing the science regarding climate change; potentially unethical behavior involving Trump and his family; and corruption and conflicts of interest involving his appointees. Most threatening to Trump, they can demand his tax returns and investigate the prospective connection between Trump\u2019s financial interests and his decisions as president \u2015 including with respect to Russia.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nHere lurks an imminent constitutional crisis. After observing the 60-day hiatus before an election recommended by the Justice Department, special counsel Robert Mueller will likely indict more Trump associates for obstructing him and/or colluding with Russia. Thereafter, he should render a report to his superiors detailing his findings with respect to Trump.\n\nGiven Trump\u2019s pathology \u2015 and likely criminal misconduct \u2015 odds are good he will try to pre-empt the Russian investigation and suppress Mueller\u2019s report by firing Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, precipitating a war between the House and Senate that could escalate to impeachment.\n\nThe House, one expects, would respond by demanding Mueller\u2019s report, attempting to protect the Russia investigation and reviving its own. The Senate would likely confirm whatever puppet attorney general Trump appoints, unless he tries to skirt confirmation by making an interim appointment. In either case, the partisan battle over Trump would pit truth against autocracy in an unprecedented test of our constitutional democracy \u2015 which could be resolved by a conservative Supreme Court that includes Kavanaugh, an advocate for broad presidential authority.\n\nSurprisingly, then, it\u2019s the gubernatorial races that may ultimately redirect our political future. The near misses by Gillum and Abrams, while disappointing, illustrate changing demographics that upend the belief that Democrats can win these critical Southern states only by running white moderates. The election of Democratic governors in Colorado, Kansas and certain key Midwestern states, including Michigan and Wisconsin \u2015 both of which Trump won in 2016 \u2015 demonstrates the appeal of candidates who address real-life problems like health care, infrastructure and environmental protection. Beyond 2020, Democratic governors can help redraw legislative districts warped by Republican gerrymandering, and by working with Democratic state legislatures, they can begin to eradicate some of the voter suppression tactics that have so greatly benefited Republicans.\n\nUltimately, these winnable states are critical units of the Electoral College that Democrats cannot escape. They encapsulate the party\u2019s opportunity, and its challenge, in 2020 and beyond: to meld racial and social justice with a unifying economic agenda that promotes opportunity and dignity for Americans of every stripe across the electoral map.", "CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story incorrectly reported that Katie Porter had lost her race.\n\nKatie Porter, a consumer law expert and former student of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), trailed Rep. Mimi Walters (R) as of Wednesday afternoon in California\u2019s traditionally Republican Orange County. Walters is up by over 3 percentage points.\n\nThe race was competitive because of backlash to President Donald Trump among moderate suburban voters in California\u2019s 45th Congressional District \u2015 one of seven Republican-controlled seats in a state that Hillary Clinton won in 2016.\n\nPorter ran as unabashed proponent of Medicare for all, expanded Social Security and tough banking rules, even as she emphasized issues with broad appeal: the damaging effect of Republicans\u2019 tax cuts and effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act, tougher gun laws and women\u2019s reproductive rights.\n\nBecause so many California voters cast their ballots by mail or through absentee voting, it could take days to know the final outcome in the 45th District. But if the results hold, the district\u2019s highly educated and affluent residents will have stuck with their fiscally conservative instincts.\n\nWalters, 56, a former investment banker who serves in House Republican leadership, is likely headed to a third term in Congress, while Porter, 44, is likely to return to her post as a law professor at the University of California, Irvine.\n\nPorter, who collaborated with Warren in studying the impact of health care costs on household bankruptcies, was one of just two candidates who Warren endorsed in the Democratic primaries. Warren was also an early backer of former Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Director Richard Cordray\u2019s gubernatorial bid in Ohio. (Cordray lost to Republican Mike DeWine, making Tuesday a bittersweet day for the Massachusetts senator as she cruised to re-election in her own state.)\n\nWalters, who was registered to vote in another district as recently as June 2017, is on track to prevail despite weaknesses that made her vulnerable to attacks by Porter. Unlike some other Republicans in vulnerable seats, Walters stuck with Trump on his two major legislative initiatives \u2015 the failed bid to repeal the ACA, as well as the tax cut bill, which became law.\n\nAlthough California\u2019s 45th is an affluent district, the tax law\u2019s near-elimination of the state and local tax, or SALT, deduction made it a net tax hike for many of the district\u2019s upper-middle-class residents. Porter\u2019s support for reinstating the deduction earned her the support of the influential California and National Realtors Associations, which spent heavily on her behalf.\n\nPorter also bucked the California Democratic Party by declaring her intention to vote for a ballot initiative repealing a modest gas tax levied by the Democratic-run state government to fund infrastructure improvements. She argued that Orange County residents had already been hit hard by the federal tax law and that infrastructure funds could be secured through other means.", "You\u2019ve never seen Russell Crowe like this before.\n\nThe Oscar-winning actor has been transformed into the late Fox News chief Roger Ailes for an upcoming Showtime series.

But the Oregon measure\u2019s defeat showed that voters in one state, at least, weren\u2019t convinced by rhetoric that demonized undocumented people and policies meant to protect them.\n\n\u201cWe are very proud that Oregon will continue to be a beacon of hope during these troubling times,\u201d the ACLU of Oregon said in a statement that applauded voters\u2019 rejection of the anti-sanctuary measure and an anti-abortion constitutional amendment.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump and some Oregon politicians have targeted our communities and played the politics of fear and division, but the overwhelming majority of Oregon voters did not fall for it,\u201d the ACLU added.\n\nOregon\u2019s sanctuary state policy is especially notable because of its 31-year duration, which meant it served as a model for other jurisdictions. There\u2019s no set definition for sanctuary jurisdictions, even though they\u2019re often referenced in campaign ads and political speeches. The term often describes policies that restrict local law enforcement\u2019s cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nIn Oregon, thanks to a 1987 law, local law enforcement is barred from using resources to police immigration by finding or detaining undocumented people who are not suspected of a non-immigration-related offense. ICE can still make arrests in the state.\n\nThe law originated a decade earlier, when officers approached Latino men at a restaurant and pressed them on their immigration status. One of them, a U.S. citizen, filed a class-action lawsuit accusing the officers of acting on behalf of immigration authorities. The lawsuit was later dismissed, but the man\u2019s lawyer successfully pushed for a law limiting the ability of police to be immigration enforcers.\n\nOregon is home to an estimated 130,000 undocumented immigrants.", "Discussing the impact of Democrats taking back the House of Representatives in Tuesday\u2019s election, \u201cThe Late Show\u201d host Stephen Colbert noted that the probable next chair of the House intelligence committee, Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), \u201cgets a rusty hacksaw to just start sawing open the White House and asking them questions.\u201d\n\nThat prompted Alex Wagner, of Showtime\u2019s \u201cThe Circus\u201d and CBS News, formerly a HuffPost reporter, to recommend an immediate course of action for everyone in President Donald Trump\u2019s White House.\n\nIt\u2019s just two words.\n\nSchiff has criticized previous GOP-led investigations of Russian interference in the 2016 election and the Trump campaign\u2019s possible collusion with the Kremlin.

Maybe that\u2019s because I don\u2019t remember a time when I didn\u2019t feel like something was wrong. As a kid, I did not like skirts and dresses, pink or Barbie dolls. I wanted to wear blue basketball shorts and T-shirts. I wanted to participate in sports, build with Legos and play dinosaurs.\n\nIt\u2019s not that I was a little girl who just wanted to be a boy. Every single cell in my body was telling me that I was a boy. I would have vivid dreams that this were true, only to wake up and stare in the mirror in disbelief. It made me want to crawl out of my skin and cry. But I felt like I had no options, that no one would ever take me seriously. So, I repressed these feelings for a long time.\n\nA year before high school, I came out to my family and friends as a lesbian. I got my first buzz cut and dressed very masculine. I was sometimes mistaken for a boy, which made me light up every time I heard it. But the truth is: I was still in denial. I did not know anything about the transition process, and the thought of it scared me. I wish I had resources back then, or someone to look up to; then maybe I would have started the process sooner.\n\nAfter graduating high school, I was dead-set on attending the University of Massachusetts Amherst to pursue an undergraduate degree in pre-veterinary studies. There was an LGBTQIA/Ally inclusive floor that I wanted to live on to make myself more comfortable. On the first day of attendance, I met so many different members of the LGBTQIA+ community, and among the crowd were a couple of transgender men who were in different stages of transitioning. One of them was very open about his transition, and I admired him immediately, bombarding him with questions about the process.\n\nIn 2011, by the fall of my sophomore year, I knew what I had to do: I had to come out, again.\n\nAt first, I just told my friends at school. Most of them didn\u2019t even bat an eye. I changed my name and pronouns on Facebook, which my mom then saw and called me right away. I told her about my intentions to transition to male, and although she used words like \u201cout of the blue\u201d and \u201cnever saw this coming,\u201d she came around pretty quickly. My dad, on the other hand, took a couple of years to come to terms with my transition. Eventually, though, he proudly accepted me as his son.\n\nThere was an awkward period at the beginning of my transition when I would get misgendered a lot; people would use my old name or \u201cshe/her\u201d pronouns. Every time that happened it was like a stab in the chest. I just wanted to leave my old life behind and live as \u201cDamien.\u201d But I started hormone replacement therapy in early 2012. As the hormones set in, my voice deepened, I put on more muscle mass, and I started to grow facial hair. Within a year or two, I was no longer misgendered and I began to truly feel like who I was supposed to be: a man.\n\nI got my top surgery done a year after I came out, during my junior year at UMass. Thankfully, the university\u2019s insurance covered it and I did not have to pay out of pocket. Soon, I lived my life passing as a cisgender male. It felt great, and I lived what the community calls \u201cstealth\u201d where I didn\u2019t tell anyone about my past. I just wanted to live a \u201cnormal\u201d male life, without the constant questions and judgment.\n\nI graduated college in 2014 and landed a job in my field the following year. All was going well, but after a while, I started to feel inauthentic. In 2017, at the age of 25 \u2015 six years after starting my transition \u2015 I decided to come out again, this time publicly as an openly transgender male.\n\nFirst, I took to Instagram. I didn\u2019t have many followers at first, but that would soon change after making my initial National Coming Out Day post. I had people from all over the world messaging me for advice, or just to tell me how inspiring my story was. All the positive feedback made me realize my story is an important one to share, and it gave me the strength to jump my last hurdle: telling my workplace the truth about my past.\n\nI had been working as an animal care technician for a university for two years. I shared a locker room with other men daily. No one had a clue that I was transgender, and I took a lot of pride in that. It reassured me that transitioning was the right thing to do. I was also afraid that if my co-workers knew, they would treat me differently and it would hurt my chances of a promotion. Eventually, a few people started to find out because my social media platforms were public. I was afraid of rumors spreading, and if anyone were going to find out, I wanted it to come from me directly.\n\nA few months after coming out on social media, I received a promotion to supervisor at my job, and I was ecstatic. I stayed quiet during my probationary period, but as soon as that ended, I was at the Diversity and Inclusion Office, discussing strategies on how to come out to my department of 70 people. We decided to put together a presentation about \u201cBeing Authentic at Work\u201d for one of our quarterly department meetings. I was nervous, voice shaky and palms sweating. I was expecting the room to break out in hushed whispers when I was done, eyes darting around the room. But I got through my presentation, and at the end, the department stood for a standing ovation.\n\nI expected to get bombarded with questions, but to my pleasant surprise, it was like nothing had changed. I still have the respect of my direct reports and no one gives me a second look in the locker rooms.\n\nSeven years passed between coming out as transgender in college and coming out publicly at my job. Since coming out here, I have been asked by the Diversity and Inclusion Office to speak at other events and join the university\u2019s LGBTQIA+ committee. It feels amazing to be able to bring awareness and give back to the community that has allowed me to live my life as my authentic self.\n\nAuthenticity and visibility are so important. I want to be the role model that I didn\u2019t have growing up. I want to be a resource to help other people who may be struggling with their identities, to show them there is hope.", "Tap here to turn on desktop notifications to get the news sent straight to you.", "Sacha Baron Cohen spilled the beans on what went on behind the scenes during the filming of satirical series \u201cWho Is America?\u201d on Tuesday\u2019s broadcast of \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live!\u201d\n\nThe British comedian revealed the hilarious last-minute precaution he was so glad he took before interviewing Dick Cheney for an episode that aired this year, in which he got the former vice president to sign a waterboard kit.\n\nCohen also explained why he armed himself with a bulletproof clipboard for another prank, and trained with the FBI ahead of his sit-down with former footballer and ex-con O.J.

But the last thing you want as you grow older is for your children to bear the burden of your poor financial planning.\n\nThe longer we live, the more expenses we rack up, and the further our retirement dollars need to stretch. Married couples have the longest life expectancy, with a 72 percent chance that one person will live to age 85 and a 45 percent chance that one will live to age 90.\n\nSo to ensure you have enough money in your golden years to cover those costs and not pass on the responsibility to your children, take these five steps now.\n\n1. Don\u2019t sacrifice your retirement funds to help your kids (or grandkids).\n\nkali9 via Getty Images Parents spend twice as much supporting their adult children as they do saving for their own retirement.\n\nThe student loan debt crisis isn\u2019t just affecting young adults fresh out of college. According to Marketwatch, families who took out parent PLUS loans and had with a student who earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2016 owed about $32,596 in parent PLUS debt. That\u2019s close to a 20 percent increase over the class of 2012. And people can be carrying the burden of student loans even as they hope to head into retirement: A whopping 2.8 million borrowers over the age of 60 owed student debt in 2015.\n\nThe problem with parent PLUS loans, in particular, is that they don\u2019t offer borrowers the same protections as federal student loans, such as income-driven repayment plans and loan forgiveness tied to public service. The same goes for private loans, which are notoriously inflexible when it comes to assistance for borrowers who struggle to make their payments. And parents don\u2019t enjoy the return on investment of their child\u2019s degree \u2015 they\u2019re simply saddled with debt that bites into their retirement income.\n\nTaking out educational loans is just one way parents overextend themselves to help out their children. A study by Merrill Lynch found that parents in the U.S. spend $500 billion every year on their adult children, twice what they put away for their own retirement.\n\n\u201cSome parents just want to be super generous to their children or grandchildren and they start wanting to make gifts, whether it\u2019s funding a grandchild\u2019s 529 plan or helping a child become a doctor or a lawyer,\u201d said Quentara Costa, a certified financial planner and founder of Powwow LLC.\n\nThough such generosity is understandable, \u201cthere\u2019s not a lot of time to recoup that money if they\u2019re thinking they\u2019re retiring soon or they\u2019ve already retired,\u201d Costa said.\n\n2. Prepare for the major cost of medical care.\n\n\u201cHealth care is a bigger expense than just about anybody plans for,\u201d said Sean Gillespie, a fee-only financial advisor with Redeployment Wealth Strategies. In fact, Fidelity estimates that the average couple who retires today at age 65 will need $280,000 to cover health care and medical costs in retirement.\n\nMany people count on shifting over to Medicare at age 65. But what they don\u2019t understand is \u201cyou\u2019re going to pay for your Medicare \u2015 it\u2019s not something that you just pay for out of your paycheck all your life along with Social Security and then stop paying for,\u201d said Gillespie. \u201cYou actually have Medicare premiums when you hit 65.\u201d And there\u2019s no real benefit to not signing up for Medicare until you really need it because there are penalties for that.\n\nThe $280,000 figure also includes out-of-pocket costs such as deductibles, cost-sharing requirements for drugs and certain services, and devices that Medicare doesn\u2019t cover, such as hearing aids.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not uncommon to spend more on medical care in the last year of your life than you did in every year of your life combined [before that].\u201d - Sean Gillespie, a financial planner\n\nWorst of all, that estimate doesn\u2019t include long-term care, which is another major expense that older people should be ready to shoulder.\n\n\u201cWe tend to do a great deal of our spending on medical care in the last year of our lives. And for a lot of people, it\u2019s not uncommon to spend more on medical care in the last year of your life than you did in every year of your life combined [before that],\u201d Gillespie said.\n\n3. Consider a long-term care insurance policy.\n\nFS Productions via Getty Images Long-term care costs a total of $140,000 on average.\n\nYou don\u2019t buy home insurance expecting your house to burn down. But you know that\u2019s a possibility \u2015 and if something like that did happen, you\u2019d be in a pretty bad place financially without the policy.\n\nThe same goes for long-term care insurance. Research shows that after age 65, there\u2019s a 50-50 chance you\u2019ll require long-term care at some point. And in most cases, Medicare won\u2019t cover it. Considering that average long-term care costs amount to about $140,000, failing to insure yourself is like heading to Vegas and plunking down your life savings on black. It\u2019s a gamble you really shouldn\u2019t take if you can help it.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have some sort of insurance policy to help cover those costs, it\u2019s coming out of your pocket,\u201d Gillespie said.\n\nThere are many options in long-term care policies and the devil is in the details. For instance, most plans have a 90-day elimination period, which means you pay out-of-pocket for the first 90 days before the benefits kick in. You can find others with no elimination period, but prepare to pay a higher premium. And if you encounter a policy that doesn\u2019t offer any inflation protection, \u201cwalk away,\u201d Gillespie said.\n\n4. Have a Social Security strategy in place.\n\nIt can be tempting to grab your Social Security benefits as soon as you become eligible. After all, you paid into the system for decades and who knows if you\u2019ll be around tomorrow. Why wait any longer to get your money?\n\nThe fact is that waiting as long as possible to claim Social Security benefits can pay off in the long run. First, the system credits you for delaying retirement (up to a point). Second, Social Security payments are based on mortality tables that haven\u2019t been updated since 1983, according to CNBC, but Americans have longer life expectancies today. So the system actually credits you for delaying retirement more than it probably should. \u201cThe difference between age 62 and age 70 is remarkable,\u201d Gillespie said.\n\nFor example, if you wait until your full retirement age of 66 (or 67, depending on when you were born), your benefit will be 25 percent higher than if you claimed it as early as possible. And if you wait even longer, that benefit increases by an additional 8 percent each year until you reach 70. On the other hand, if you claim Social Security benefits at age 62, \u201cyou are accepting a permanent reduction to those benefits,\u201d Gillespie said.\n\nBut what if you\u2019re not around much longer than that?\n\nYou can play all kinds of math games with this: If somebody who was born the same day as you were and had earned identical Social Security benefits began claiming them at age 62, and you waited until you were 70, that person would pull more dollars out of the system until you both reached age 82. After that point, you would come out ahead.\n\nThe bigger issue is what happens to you if you reach 82, need Social Security to meet your bills and didn\u2019t hold off to get the larger benefit.\n\n\u201cAt that age, our biggest financial risk is not if we do die, but if we don\u2019t,\u201d Gillespie said.\n\n5. Plan for the possibility of divorce.\n\nPeopleImages via Getty Images Divorce rates among older Americans are on the rise.\n\nThanks to longer lifespans, shifting attitudes and diminishing stigma around the idea of divorce, older adults are splitting up more than ever. In fact, over the last 25 years, the divorce rate among those age 50 and older has about doubled. And those 50 and older who are married for the second time are twice as likely to divorce as those who\u2019ve only been married once.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m seeing that more often, people at an older age are getting a divorce because they stay together for the kids. And now that the kids are off to college or through college, they\u2019re saying, \u2018Hey, this is my time,\u2019\u201d said Costa.\n\nThe problem? Their combined income remains the same and their assets remain the same, but now they have to fund two separate sets of living costs. \u201cSo now it\u2019s cable times two and electric times two. What was affordable when they were together as a couple may now not be affordable,\u201d she said.\n\nSo if divorce could be a possibility in the future, you may want to set aside savings for the added expenses.\n\nWhen\u2019s the right time to start planning?\n\nAccording to Costa, the best time to plan for your elder years is around age 50.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re through a lot of the initial milestones that may be coming your way,\u201d she explained. \u201cThere\u2019s not as much short-term goal planning where you\u2019re just trying to get through the next month. You\u2019re at a point where you\u2019ve reached a kind of stasis for your mortgage payment, your career, etc.\u201d\n\nPlus, Costa warned, your 50s are often the last call to purchase things like long-term care or life insurance. If you wait too long, those options come off the table.", "What a difference two years can make.\n\n\u201cLate Night\u201d host Seth Meyers was famously moved to tears as he reported on Donald Trump\u2019s presidential election victory in 2016.\n\nOn Tuesday, however, Meyers had a markedly contrasting reaction to the news that Democrats had seized control of the House of Representatives:\n\nMeyers suggested the main takeaway from a \u201ccrazy, frenetic night\u201d on Tuesday was that Trump\u2019s agenda was now \u201cin serious danger.\u201d", "Yes, it IS a tremendous success tonight.

The Montana initiative failed, with 53 percent voting against.\n\nThese four campaigns started out with grassroots organizing by local residents, who gathered support from allies including organizations representing physicians, hospitals, chambers of commerce, patient advocates and progressive groups.\n\nThe approval of these ballot initiatives in deeply Republican states could be seen as a repudiation of President Donald Trump and his party\u2019s attempts to scale back government health care programs, especially during a national campaign that focused heavily on health care. That\u2019s despite Republican candidates winning key elections in those same states, including for governor in Idaho and Nebraska.\n\nEach had the support of The Fairness Project, a labor-backed operation that provides funding and assistance to direct-democracy campaigns for Medicaid expansion and minimum-wage increases. In Idaho, outgoing Gov. Butch Otter (R) even endorsed the ballot initiative last week and appeared in a television ad promoting it.\n\n\u201cThis election proves that politicians who voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act got it wrong,\u201d Jonathan Schleifer, executive director of the Fairness Project, said in a press release. \u201cAmericans want to live in a country where everyone can go to the doctor without going bankrupt. Expanding access to health care isn\u2019t a blue state value or a red state value; it\u2019s an American value.\u201d\n\nMoreover, voters sent a clear message to the elected officials in their states \u2015 most of whom are Republican \u2015 that they haven\u2019t been listening to what their constituents want. Medicaid expansion languished in Idaho, Nebraska and Utah for years. Montana Gov. Steve Bullock (D) and the majority-Republican state legislature expanded Medicaid in 2015, but it was slated to expire on July 1, 2019, and activists were worried GOP lawmakers would refuse to extend it.\n\nA year ago, Maine voters approved a ballot initiative to expand Medicaid, which inspired activists in Idaho, Montana, Nebraska and Utah to try the same approach.\n\nThe fight isn\u2019t over in those states, however. The state legislatures, all of which are controlled by Republicans, and the GOP governors of Idaho, Nebraska and Utah, could opt to obstruct the implementation of the Medicaid expansion, as LePage did.\n\nState lawmakers also must pass legislation allocating the states\u2019 share of the cost of expanded Medicaid.\n\nWhether they decide to defy the will of their voters is unknown, although Idaho gubernatorial winner Brad Little (R) promised during the campaign that he wouldn\u2019t obstruct expansion if voters approve it.\n\nWith voters in these states opting to expand Medicaid to as many as 300,000 people, there remain just 14 states that haven\u2019t adopted the policy, which is part of the Affordable Care Act. An estimated 90,000 Montanans already enrolled in expanded Medicaid are at risk of losing it next year because the ballot initiative there didn\u2019t pass.\n\nKelly\u2019s victory in Kansas improves the odds that there will at least be a full debate on the question. When Democrat Ralph Northam won the Virginia gubernatorial election last year, he moved quickly to press the GOP-led legislature on Medicaid expansion and was able to enact the policy his Republican predecessors rejected.\n\nThe ACA called for Medicaid to be available to anyone earning up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level, which is about $16,000 for a single person and $33,000 for a family of four. Under the law, the federal government pays at least 90 percent of the cost of covering newly eligible people. But a 2012 Supreme Court ruling allowed states to refuse to participate in the expansion, leaving an estimated 2.5 million people uninsured in states that haven\u2019t expanded the program.\n\nThe ballot initiative campaigns heavily focused on the people in the \u201ccoverage gap\u201d created when their home states didn\u2019t adopt Medicaid expansion. Because Congress wrote the law in 2010 expecting Medicaid expansion to be nationwide, lawmakers didn\u2019t make subsidies for private insurance available to people with incomes below the poverty line, meaning they are ineligible for any assistance in non-expansion states.\n\nThe activists who led the campaigns in Idaho, Montana, Nebraska and Utah fought against long odds.\n\nAll four states are strongly Republican. Idaho, Nebraska and Utah haven\u2019t backed a Democratic presidential candidate since 1964, and Montana hasn\u2019t since 1992. Trump won each state by wide margins over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in 2016. There hasn\u2019t been a Democratic governor in Idaho since 1995, in Nebraska since 1999 or in Utah since 1985. Montana\u2019s governors have been Democrats since 2005, after 16 straight years of GOP governors. Republicans have also dominated the congressional delegations and state legislatures in those states for years.\n\nThese successful ballot initiatives, however, don\u2019t inherently signify partisan shifts among voters in these states, which still elected mostly Republicans to state and federal offices. The organizers who ran these Medicaid campaigns knew that victory was based on attracting voters who would support Medicaid expansion even though they planned to also back GOP candidates.\n\nIn addition to overcoming those partisan and ideological obstacles, all four states have strict laws governing ballot initiatives. Organizers are required to collect signatures for a significant number of residents \u2015 which varies by state \u2015 and also to get signatures from voters all across the states, including from conservative and rural areas.\n\nIn Montana, Medicaid expansion advocates faced a fight with tobacco companies because the ballot initiative calls for an increase in the taxes on cigarettes and other products to finance the expansion. In the other states, Republican officials and organizations like Americans for Prosperity urged voters to reject the ballot initiative, but there was little in the way of organized opposition compared to what proponents did.", "Borat Sagdiyev is back!\n\nBritish comedian Sacha Baron Cohen jumped back into character as the bumbling Kazakh journalist on Tuesday night\u2019s midterm election special broadcast of \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live!\u201d\n\nBorat went door to door in an unidentified Los Angeles neighborhood in a bid to drum up support for President Donald Trump and the GOP.\n\n\u201cRussia interfere with the presidential election,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now, all eyes are on them.

Although Democratic senators easily dispatched GOP opponents in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, they didn\u2019t match those results at the gubernatorial level, failing to capture governor\u2019s races in Ohio and Iowa, two states Trump had won easily in 2016.\n\nBut here, there were also reasons for optimism: In Wisconsin, Democrat Tony Evers narrowly won early Wednesday, apparently finally ousting GOP Gov. Scott Walker.\n\nBut Walker\u2019s running mate, Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch, said early Wednesday morning that the campaign wasn\u2019t conceding.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here tonight to tell you that fight is not over,\u201d she told supporters, before requesting donations to fund a possible recount.\n\nThere were also other triumphs: Democrat Laura Kelly romped over a favorite of Trump\u2019s, Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, by a 5 percentage point margin. Initiatives to raise the minimum wage passed in Arkansas and Missouri, as did Medicaid expansion in a slew of red states. And the Democratic Party made massive gains at the state level, bringing unified Democratic government to Colorado, Illinois, Maine, New Mexico and New York. It also ended one-party GOP rule in Kansas, Michigan and New Hampshire.\n\nBut the biggest victory was always going to be control of the House, which will give the party the power to investigate every aspect of Trump\u2019s administration and stop all but the most bipartisan legislation. In the past, presidents who have lost the House have appeared apologetic. When George W. Bush lost 31 House seats in 2006, he called it a \u201cthumping.\u201d When Barack Obama\u2019s Democrats lost control of the House in 2010, he labeled it a \u201cshellacking.\u201d\n\nThe GOP\u2019s gains in the Senate allowed Trump to make a different claim.", "Ethan Miller via Getty Images Health care and protections for people with pre-existing conditions figured heavily in the Nevada Senate race.\n\nRep. Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.) defeated incumbent Republican Dean Heller in the race for Nevada\u2019s U.S. Senate seat on Tuesday. Nevada is now the fifth state to have two female senators.\n\n\u201cWomen are winning up and down the ballot. This is a historic night for us,\u201d Rosen said in her victory speech.\n\nHeller was one of the Senate\u2019s most vulnerable Republicans this cycle, running for re-election in a state Democrat Hillary Clinton carried in the in 2016 presidential election.\n\nAfter once saying he \u201cvehemently\u201d opposed Donald Trump, a figure reviled by many communities in Nevada, Heller aligned himself with the president and his policies. His 2017 vote to repeal Obamacare, in particular, opened him up to blistering attacks over the health care law and its protections for people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nJacky Rosen: \u201cThis is a historic night for us, because now Nevada joins to be the fifth state with two women senators.\u201d https://t.co/QF15MHrJt2 #ElectionNight pic.twitter.com/kOaccjwGbK \u2014 ABC News (@ABC) November 7, 2018\n\nAt a debate earlier this month, Heller claimed he personally authored health care legislation that would have maintained protections for pre-existing conditions. He said the issue was personal for him because his daughter had recently adopted a two-year-old girl from China.\n\n\u201cShe does have pre-existing conditions, and I will protect those pre-existing conditions for that little Chinese girl,\u201d Heller said.\n\nBut the bill he referenced \u2015 which was narrowly defeated with the help of three Senate Republicans last year \u2015 would have allowed states to end those protections.\n\nRosen, a freshman congresswoman who once worked as a computer engineer, made Heller\u2019s Obamacare repeal vote a huge part of the campaign by accusing him of breaking his promise to Nevada voters about protecting people with pre-existing conditions. She also called the GOP senator a \u201crubber stamp\u201d for Trump and his immigration policies, pledging to Latino voters in the state in Spanish-language ads that she would stand up to the president.\n\nHeller and GOP outside groups countered by painting Rosen as an extreme liberal who supports sanctuary cities and hasn\u2019t done enough to stop unauthorized immigration or gangs like MS-13. Trump even gave her a derisive nickname: \u201cWacky Jacky.\u201d\n\nBoth campaigns focused on early voting and turning out their base to the polls ahead of the election. Ballots cast before Election Day usually account for approximately 60 percent of the vote in Nevada. That why Heller\u2019s campaign held several rallies with Trump in rural parts of the state to help offset more urban areas like Las Vegas and Reno. Rosen, meanwhile, rallied with former President Barack Obama and former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nThe decisive advantage for Rosen may have been the fabled \u201cReid machine,\u201d a network of well-organized volunteers, activists, union members and party officials dedicated to getting Democrats to vote. It\u2019s named after former Nevada Sen. Harry Reid, the de-facto party boss in the state, who hand-picked Rosen to run against Heller this year.", "Three more states legalized marijuana for recreational or medical use on Tuesday.\n\nVoters in Michigan legalized recreational marijuana, making it the 10th state in the nation and the first state in the Midwest to do so. In both Utah and Missouri, voters legalized marijuana for medical purposes \u2015 the 31st and 32nd states to approve medical cannabis. In North Dakota, voters rejected a measure that would have legalized recreational marijuana.\n\n\u201cThis is yet another historic election for the movement to end marijuana prohibition,\u201c said Steve Hawkins, executive director of the Marijuana Policy Project, which played a leading role in organizing the Michigan initiative. \u201cVoters have once again sent a message loud and clear that it is time to legalize and regulate marijuana. The victory in Michigan highlights just how widespread support is for marijuana policy reform. This issue does not only enjoy strong support on the coasts but also in the Midwest and all throughout the country.\u201d\n\nMichigan voters approved Proposal 1, allowing adults 21 and older to buy, grow, use and possess marijuana for recreational purposes. Under the measure, adults can be in possession of 2.5 ounces of marijuana, a provision similar to the state\u2019s medical marijuana law that was approved in 2008. Adults can also grow up to 12 marijuana plants in their homes for personal use. Additionally, the initiative legalizes the cultivation of industrial hemp, which can be used to make textiles, biofuels and foods.\n\nVoters in Missouri were considering three separate proposals to legalize medical marijuana on their ballot, and all three aimed to legalize the use, purchase and possession of marijuana for medical purposes and would allow the state to set up a regulatory framework for licensed dispensaries. On Tuesday night, just one passed. Amendment 2 legalized medical marijuana and imposes a 4 percent tax on all marijuana sales. That revenue will be used for health care services for veterans.\n\nIn Utah, the Salt Lake Tribune projected that voters would approve Proposition 2, which allows patients to legally use, possess and purchase marijuana for medical purposes for conditions such as HIV, multiple sclerosis, post-traumatic stress disorder, epilepsy, autism, cancer and Alzheimer\u2019s. During any 14-day period, a state-licensed cardholder could purchase as much as 2 ounces of marijuana. The measure would ban the smoking of marijuana but does allow vaping, marijuana-infused edibles and other means of consumption. Beginning in 2021, medical marijuana cardholders who live more than 100 miles from a state-licensed dispensary would be allowed to grow as many as six marijuana plants for personal medicinal use.\n\nHowever, access to legal medical marijuana was likely in the state, regardless if the measure passed. In October, Utah medical marijuana advocates and state lawmakers agreed to a compromise bill that would legalize medical marijuana in the state but with some differences from the ballot initiative. The most significant changes in the compromise bill include: Some qualifying conditions would be removed while others would be added, local jurisdictions would have more power to ban dispensaries in their regions, dispensaries would be forced to have a licensed pharmacist on staff and the shops would be renamed to pharmacies, and edibles would be banned along with smoking, but other ways to consume cannabis would still be allowed.\n\nThe bill requires a full vote in the state Legislature and a signature from the governor to become law. Utah Gov. Gary Herbert (R) has called for a special session of the Utah Legislature in an effort to pass the compromise bill. The bill appears to have support from a number of key stakeholders in the state, from advocates, policymakers and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n\nTuesday\u2019s victories expand the gains that the movement to legalize marijuana have already made this year. In January, California, the largest legal marijuana market in the U.S., opened its first recreational marijuana shops. That same month, Vermont became the ninth state in the nation \u2015 and the first to do so through its state legislature rather than a referendum \u2015 to legalize recreational marijuana (sales remain banned, unlike the other legal recreational states). Oklahoma became the 30th state to legalize marijuana for medical use in June.\n\nAnd while New Jersey lawmakers missed a deadline to legalize recreational marijuana earlier last month, they have vowed to vote on the legislation before the end of the year. Also last month, Canada opened its first recreational marijuana dispensaries, becoming the largest marijuana marketplace in the world.\n\nMarijuana is the most commonly used illicit substance in the United States. And the trend of states bucking prohibition in favor of legal regulation of the plant reflects a broad cultural shift toward greater acceptance of legal marijuana that has continued to grow in recent years. Now, two in three Americans support legalization. More than half of the states in the nation have legalized marijuana in some form. And states like Colorado, the first to establish a regulated adult-use marijuana marketplace, have seen successes that have debunked some lawmakers\u2019 and law enforcers\u2019 predictions that such policies would result in disaster.", "Candidates in Georgia must get at least 50 percent of the vote to win outright.

Jerry Brown that increased the state\u2019s gasoline taxes for the first time in decades, adding 12 cents to the 28-cents-per-gallon excise tax on gasoline and 20 cents to the diesel tax over the course of 10 years. That\u2019s on top of the 18 cents per gallon paid in federal taxes, making California the state with the second highest gas tax.\n\nThe majority of the tens of billions in funds generated by the tax hike are slated for road rehabilitation projects with the goal of bringing at least 98 percent of state highway pavement into good or fair condition. 68 percent of major roads and highways in California are in poor or mediocre condition \u2015 more than twice the national average, according to a recent report by TRIP, a nonpartisan, nonprofit transportation research group based in Washington, D.C.\n\nAbout a quarter of the money is slated for other projects, including improvements to public transportation systems and traffic reduction.\n\nWith Prop. 6 a failure, such transit improvement projects already in the works will be able to continue with the same funding.\n\nProp. 6\u2019s largely Republican advocates argued that money for those projects should have come from elsewhere in California\u2019s massive budget and that hiking up the tax was an unfair burden on drivers.

Kemp, who oversaw the election because he refused to resign as secretary of state, reportedly engaged in multiple attempts to suppress the black vote in Georgia and purge the voter rolls.\n\nUnder Kemp\u2019s leadership, the state\u2019s process for verifying voters\u2019 information left the registration applications of over 53,000 people in jeopardy \u2015 70 percent of which were from black voters. Officials also tried to close polling places in majority black counties.\n\nKemp\u2019s office publicly announced two days before the election, without evidence, that it would open an investigation into the Georgia Democratic Party for allegedly hacking into voting machines. Democrats called the move a \u201creckless and unethical ploy,\u201d noting that Kemp should have resigned his office before running for governor to avoid a conflict of interest.\n\n\u201cIf you are aspiring to the highest office in the state in which you pledge to look out for the people of your state, then how can you actively try to prevent the citizens of your state from exercising their most basic right?\u201d former President Barack Obama asked while campaigning for Abrams.\n\nKemp and Abrams have both been stockpiling money for a possible runoff. Kemp has raised nearly a quarter-million dollars for the effort since July, while Abrams has raised about $100,000.\n\nAt the election night party for Abrams in Atlanta on Tuesday night, the crowd \u2015 mostly made up of women of color \u2015 was clearly excited about the historic nature of Abrams\u2019 campaign and the potential to break a glass ceiling in Georgia. But in contrast to Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign in 2016, it seemed like people came in realistic and clear-eyed about a potential loss.\n\n\u201cNo matter what happens, this is history,\u201d said Deedee, 52. \u201cI even told my Uber driver that the ride was a part of history.\u201d\n\nAbrams campaigned on expanding Medicaid and voting rights across the state. She grew up poor in Mississippi, one of six children with a mother who worked as a librarian and a father who worked in a shipyard. She went on to graduate from Yale Law School and has been open about the fact that she is still $200,000 in debt from student and credit card loans. She\u2019s a single woman, and she has written romance novels on the side while rising through local politics.\n\nKemp embraced President Donald Trump and his politics throughout the race, emphasizing gun rights and threatening in one ad to \u201cround up\u201d undocumented immigrants himself in his giant pick-up truck.\n\nThe razor-thin race between two such different candidates has captivated the nation. Obama flew to Georgia to stump for Abrams, as did celebrities like Oprah Winfrey, Will Ferrell and Michael B. Jordan. Winfrey urged women and people of color to stand up to voter suppression efforts.\n\n\u201cWhen you can feel what is the right thing to do,\u201d she said, \u201cyou can\u2019t be influenced by propaganda and fear.\u201d\n\nTrump and Vice President Mike Pence held rallies for Kemp, with the former charging that Abrams is \u201cnot qualified\u201d to be governor \u2015 despite her Yale Law degree and six years leading the state House.", "Zach Wahls, who seven years ago stood before the Iowa House of Representatives and delivered a stirring speech defending his two lesbian mothers, has just become a state lawmaker himself.\n\nIn a landslide victory over his libertarian opponent, Carl Krambeck, Wahls, a Democrat, clinched 78 percent of the vote in Iowa Senate District 37.

Half the money that the newly passed Proposition C generates will go toward building permanent housing for homeless residents.\n\nSan Francisco voters have passed Proposition C after a heated campaign to tax the city\u2019s wealthiest businesses in order to double funding for its overstretched homelessness services.\n\nThe measure, which divided both tech CEOs and local leaders, approves a new tax of 0.175 to 0.69 percent on any businesses\u2019 gross annual receipts that total over $50 million.\n\nThough it\u2019s expected to affect 300 to 400 businesses, many regard it as an effort to get the city\u2019s newcomer tech companies to help solve a homelessness crisis that\u2019s come to define the city as much as the tech industry has. Just weeks before the election, the United Nations singled out the issue of homelessness in San Francisco as being \u201ccruel and inhumane\u201d and \u201cin violation of human rights.\u201d\n\nProp. C expects to raise as much as $300 million for homelessness services, nearly doubling what San Francisco currently spends to help the estimated 7,500 individuals and 1,200 families living on its streets. It mandates that half of the money it generates go toward permanent housing; one-quarter toward mental health and addiction services; 15 percent toward homeless prevention programs, such as rent assistance and eviction defense; and 10 percent toward emergency shelters and hygiene programs.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff led the push for passing Proposition C in the tech community.\n\nIn an assessment of the ballot measure\u2019s claims, the city\u2019s Office of Economic Analysis concluded that Prop. C would likely succeed in reducing homelessness in San Francisco and \u201cimproving health outcomes and reducing the use of acute and emergency services in the city.\u201d\n\nBut the assessment also found that the new tax may cost the city 725 to 875 jobs a year over the next two decades \u2015 a net estimate found by factoring in both the jobs lost because of higher business taxes and the jobs gained by increased spending on construction and homeless services.\n\nDespite the possibility of jobs leaving the city, it was championed by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), Rep Jackie Speier (D-Calif.), the San Francisco police commissioner, the San Francisco Board of Education leaders and some of the city\u2019s progressive supervisors.\n\nThe most vocal advocate among those who will be taxed has been Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, who pledged at least $2 million to help it pass. He squabbled with Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, whom Benioff accused of acting in his own financial interest without providing another solution.\n\nDorsey, whose Twitter headquarters sits squarely in the middle of a neighborhood prominently struggling with homelessness, sided with San Francisco Mayor London Breed against Prop. C on the basis that San Franciscans should listen to the mayor.\n\nBreed, who was sworn into office in July, has raised concerns about the economic effect of Proposition C, the fact that it lacks a precise spending plan and that it does not plan for oversight or audits on how the money is spent.", "Voting rights were on the ballot in the midterm elections on Tuesday, and voters sent a resoundingly clear message in favor of making elections more accessible and fairer.\n\nIn Kansas, Kris Kobach, who championed perhaps the most restrictive voting law in the country and led President Donald Trump\u2019s voter fraud commission, lost the race for Kansas governor to Democrat Laura Kelly.\n\n\u201cVoters took charge of their own elections in many places. The victories for democracy reform in Florida, Michigan, Utah, Maryland, and other places show that voters understand the importance positive voting rights reforms for the future of their elections,\u201d Josh Douglas, a law professor at the University of Kentucky, wrote in an email.\n\nThe success of the ballot measures could offer a model for how to expand voting rights for years to come. By putting voting access questions directly to voters, activists can go around state lawmakers hesitant to change election rules and a conservative U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cIt was a huge night for democracy beyond Ds and Rs,\u201d said Michael Li,senior counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice. \u201cThese measures passed in states that many doubted they ever could \u2015 and did so on a bipartisan basis. Most importantly, they were genuinely grassroots driven.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThey show that there\u2019s not one right solution for every state, but that there\u2019s a deep well of democratic\u201d support for voting rights.\n\n\u201cThese reforms enacted by these ballot referenda will have impacts for elections to come,\u201d Anthony Romero, executive director of the ACLU, which backed several of the ballot measures, said in a statement.\n\nHowever, it wasn\u2019t all good news for voting rights on Tuesday.\n\nDemocrat Katie Hobbs lost a closely watched secretary of state race in Arizona to Steve Gaynor, a GOP newcomer who said ballots should only be printed in English.\n\nThe biggest defeat came in North Carolina, where voters approved a constitutional amendment to require photo ID at the polls. North Carolina Republicans will now get to decide what forms of ID will be accepted before they lose their supermajority in the state legislature. Those details are crucial to determining how easy it will be for North Carolinians to vote.\n\nWhile they approved the photo ID requirement, however, North Carolinians rejected proposals that would have given lawmakers more power in filling judicial vacancies and appointing officials to the state elections board. Democrats strongly criticized those measures as an attempt to strip power from Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat. Democrats also expanded their majority on the state Supreme Court, electing Anita Earls (D), a well-known voting rights lawyer, to replace Republican Barbara Jackson.\n\nBut Republican control of the U.S. Senate means that Trump will have at least two more years to appoint conservative judges to the federal bench who are unlikely to support voting rights, said Rick Hasen, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine, who specializes in election law.\n\n\u201cThere were some big victories for voting rights, such as Florida\u2019s felon measure and two Michigan voting measures,\u201d Hasen said. \u201cBut voter ID won in North Carolina and I expect Republicans\u2019 continued control of the Senate will mean the appointment of more judges likely to uphold restrictive voting laws.\u201d\n\nDouglas also said there was more work to be done to pass voting reforms.\n\n\u201cGerrymandering still minimized Democratic gains in the House. Some measures \u2015 like Golden, Colorado lowering the voting age \u2015 didn\u2019t pass,\u201d he said. \u201cThis shows that voting rights champions need to continue telling the story of the importance of positive changes to our election system.\u201d", "Beto O\u2019Rourke ended his Texas campaign for Senate as a true maverick on Tuesday night, dropping an uncensored f-bomb live on national television in an address to his supporters.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so fucking proud of you guys,\u201d O\u2019Rourke, addressing those who worked on his campaign, said to thunderous applause. \u201cEverybody who worked on this campaign, every volunteer and ambassador, everyone who knocked on doors, everyone who made phone calls, everyone who allowed themselves to hope and believe, to be inspired by one another and to turn it into action and into votes.\u201d\n\nThe popular Democrat, hailed as a new face of the progressive movement in America, wasn\u2019t able to surmount Republican Sen. Ted Cruz on Tuesday, but he delivered an impassioned concession speech that focused heavily on the groundbreaking network of support that helped fuel his bid for Congress.\n\nCruz had attempted to shame O\u2019Rourke\u2019s language throughout the campaign, even releasing a 30-second mashup of the Democrat swearing at events while warning Texans that the lawmaker\u2019s rallies were not a \u201cgreat place to bring the kids.\u201d\n\nA lighthearted reminder: A #LaborDay picnic is a great place to bring the kids. A Beto O\u2019Rourke rally? Not so much... #TXSen \u2014 Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) September 3, 2018\n\nThe language was met with some awkwardness during the night\u2019s live broadcasts. MSNBC anchor Brian Williams issued a terse apology after the network aired the speech, saying \u201csorry for the f-bomb\u201d and noting that they didn\u2019t have any \u201ccontrol of what\u2019s in the concession speeches.\u201d C-SPAN also aired the clip live and uncensored, according to reports.\n\nO\u2019Rourke didn\u2019t seem to care as he spoke Tuesday, visibly exhausted and emotional.", "Democrats swept key state legislative and gubernatorial races across the country Tuesday, ensuring that at least 45 million more Americans will live under unified Democratic governance of their states next year and opening the door for sweeping policy changes on issues such as health care and education.\n\nThe results mark a dramatic turnabout for Democrats, who had full control of just eight states prior to Tuesday\u2019s elections. Republicans controlled 26 state governments, and 16 were split.\n\nBut Democrats rode a wave of voter enthusiasm into key governorships and invested huge sums to flip control of state legislatures. As of Wednesday morning, Democrats were projected to win full control in six new states \u2014 Colorado, Illinois, Maine, New Mexico, Nevada and New York \u2014 and had broken Republicans\u2019 grip on Kansas, Michigan, New Hampshire and Wisconsin.\n\nFull control of a state government \u2014 the trifecta of the state House, state Senate and governorship \u2014 brings huge benefits. Parties with full control have far more freedom to enact their policy agendas. In many states, full control also gives the party absolute power over congressional and state legislative redistricting, which means it can draw districts that will be hard for its foes to win. A wave of state-level Republican wins in 2010, ahead of the decennial congressional redistricting, helped produce the GOP\u2019s current dominance of state governments and its eight-year control of the U.S. House of Representatives. Democrats were eager to start reversing that trend this year: This cycle, the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee committed to spend $35 million, twice what it spent in 2016.\n\nThere\u2019s one more set of elections ahead of the redistricting cycle that begins in 2021. But some of this year\u2019s results are baked into that process. Barring impeachment or other unforeseen circumstances, 34 of the 36 governors elected Tuesday will still be in charge when their states get redistricted in 2021. (The governors of Vermont and New Hampshire serve unusual two-year terms and will be up for re-election again in 2020.) Democrats\u2019 wins in key gubernatorial races in states such as Colorado, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin ensure they\u2019ll have a seat at the table when those states get redistricted.\n\nDemocratic gubernatorial victories in Michigan, Kansas and Wisconsin \u2015 three states where Republicans appeared to hold onto the legislature \u2015 were particularly key because they\u2019ve prevented the GOP from holding a trifecta in those states.\n\n\u201cBreaking up trifectas is a huge part of our strategy because it doesn\u2019t allow one party to ram through whatever they want,\u201d said Patrick Rodenbush, a spokesman for the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, a group that former Attorney General Eric Holder created in 2016 to combat Democrats\u2019 disadvantage in redistricting fights. Democratic governors in Pennsylvania and Virginia recently blocked Republican gerrymanders in those states, Rodenbush noted.\n\nWinning governors\u2019 races was also the only realistic way to influence redistricting in states where past gerrymandering all but ensures that Republicans will control the legislature for several more election cycles.\n\n\u201cA lot of those chambers are not coming back to Democrats anytime soon. They\u2019re heavy lifts, long-term, multicycle projects,\u201d said David Daley, the author of Ratf**ked: The True Story Behind the Secret Plan to Steal America\u2019s Democracy, which chronicles Republicans\u2019 aggressive gerrymandering efforts. \u201cBut at least Democrats will now have veto power over bad maps.\u201d\n\nMuch as Republicans under President Barack Obama sought to fashion their states into islands of conservatism, Democrats expect to use their newfound power to hold many of the Trump administration\u2019s policies at bay.\n\nWith Congress gridlocked, \u201cwe\u2019ve seen states taking a leadership role in driving policies,\u201d said Jared Leopold, spokesman for the Democratic Governors Association. \u201cDemocratic leaders offer an alternative set of priorities to what\u2019s coming out of Washington. \u2026You will see the future of the Democratic Party emerge from the new leaders elected in 2018.\u201d\n\nWith Democrats\u2019 new wins, a total of around 112 million Americans will live in Democratic-controlled states come January. Barring shocking shifts, that would still be fewer Americans than the 130 million or so who will live in Republican-controlled states. Even so, Democrats suddenly find themselves in a position to enact significant changes on a state level in health care, voting rights, education and crime. In Maine, which is preparing to expand Medicaid to roughly 70,000 low-income residents, Democrat Janet Mills, a supporter of the expansion, beat a Republican whom many expected to restrict benefits. In Colorado, Democrats flipped the state Senate for trifecta control and chose as governor Jared Polis, who ran one of this cycle\u2019s most progressive campaigns. Incoming Kansas Governor Laura Kelly, who beat Republican Kris Kobach, is expected to work with the Republican legislature to expand Medicaid.\n\nIn states such as Illinois, New Mexico and New York, where the party needed to turn only a handful of races to take full control of the state, there are already progressive proposals waiting in the wings. In New York, where Democrats flipped the state Senate for total control of the government, progressives hope to pass long-standing proposals to expand reproductive and voting rights, and overhaul campaign finance laws. In Illinois, a Democrat beat Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner, who had spent years feuding with the Democratic legislature over his cuts to Medicaid. In New Mexico, outgoing Republican Gov. Susana Martinez had vetoed dozens of proposals that passed the Democratic legislature \u2014 bills raising taxes, reducing criminal penalties for minor crimes and shoring up education funds. Voters chose a Democrat, Michelle Lujan Grisham, as her successor.\n\nThe Trump administration is offering states multiple routes to restrict Medicaid benefits and undermine the Affordable Care Act. A string of Democratic gubernatorial victories may prevent many states from taking that path \u2014 such as in Kansas and Michigan where Republican governors requested waivers from the administration to impose work requirements and drug testing on Medicaid recipients. Newly elected Democratic governors now have the power to reject these measures.\n\nDemocrats also expect to push for broad changes to education. Colorado Democrats have pledged to increase funding to public schools. J.B. Pritzker, the governor-elect of Illinois, has promised to lower the compulsory school age from 6 years old to 5 years old. In Michigan, Gretchen Whitmer won the governor\u2019s seat with a promise to fund universal all-day preschool.", "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. \u2015 The same Florida voters who put Republican Ron DeSantis into the governor\u2019s mansion on Tuesday also passed a constitutional amendment that automatically restores ex-felons\u2019 right to vote \u2015 something DeSantis had opposed.\n\nWhile the former congressman from the Jacksonville suburbs eked out a 1-point win over Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, receiving just a hair under 50 percent of the vote, \u201cAmendment 4\u201d received 64 percent approval \u2015 comfortably over the 60-percent threshold required for constitutional amendments.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand how you vote for Amendment 4 but then don\u2019t vote for a governor to ensure the implementation of Amendment 4,\u201d said Michelle Sherfield, a Gillum supporter attending his election night party at the candidate\u2019s alma mater, Florida A&M University. \u201cI can\u2019t rationalize how you do one but don\u2019t do the other.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a grand irony,\u201d said Marcia Owens, an environmental sciences professor who released her class early Tuesday to attend the Gillum party. \u201cWhen they announced that Amendment 4 had passed, we said: \u2018If only we\u2019d had those votes for this election.\u2019\u201d\n\nNeil Volz, the political director for the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition, the primary group backing the amendment, said he was not surprised that people would back Amendment 4 as well as the state\u2019s GOP nominee for governor.\n\n\u201cThis is a movement from people from all walks of life. Republicans, Democrats, independents and people who have no party. It\u2019s been that way since the beginning,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s no surprise at all to us. We knew that people who supported both governor candidates were going to be supporting Amendment 4.\u201d\n\nCurrently, ex-felons wishing to have voting rights reinstated must undergo a lengthy process that includes petitioning the governor and independently elected Cabinet. The new amendment automatically gives voting rights back to felons who have completed their sentence, including probation and parole, with the exception of those convicted of sexual offenses and murder.\n\nGillum, who would have been the first African-American governor of Florida had he won, was a strong proponent of the amendment, which will affect 1.5 million Floridians, a disproportionate percentage of whom are black and Latino.\n\nDeSantis had opposed the proposal. \u201cAn appallingly high percentage of people who get out of prison as convicted felons re-offend,\u201d DeSantis said.\n\nBut it was not a major element of his campaign, and voters likely did not see a strong link between the two.\n\nIn Pasco County north of Tampa Bay, for example, DeSantis won 57 percent of the vote, while Amendment 4 won 61 percent approval. In all, in only six of the state\u2019s 67 counties did the proposal receive less than 50 percent of the vote.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear voters would have paid DeSantis much mind even if he had made opposition to the amendment a major issue. In 2002, Florida voters approved a constitutional amendment requiring the reduction of classroom sizes in public schools, even though then-Gov. Jeb Bush was energetically campaigning against it. (It was because of that amendment, in fact, that Bush later successfully pushed through an amendment requiring subsequent ballot initiatives to pass by 60 percent to take effect.)\n\nLongtime Republican consultant Adam Goodman said that Tuesday night again proved the independence of the state\u2019s voters when it came to their constitution. \u201cDespite normal law-and-order reservations about ex-felons, Floridians revealed tonight that they prize fairness as a pillar of freedom,\u201d he said.", "Democratic Senate candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke may have lost his bid to unseat Republican Sen.

Duncan Hunter, who stands accused of using campaign funds for personal expenses, survived a re-election challenge on Tuesday from Ammar Campa-Najjar, a progressive Democrat of Mexican-Palestinian descent.\n\nCampa-Najjar, an Obama administration alumnus, seemed like a long-shot candidate after he won his party\u2019s primary in June. The 50th Congressional District, whose residents include a large number of retired military veterans, is one of the few in California that President Donald Trump carried in 2016. And Hunter, first elected in 2008, was carrying on a family tradition \u2015 he succeeded his father, also named Duncan Hunter, who had represented the area in the House for nearly 30 years.\n\nBut in August, Hunter and his wife were indicted for allegedly funneling more than $250,000 in campaign money toward personal expenses, including vacations, bar tabs and private school tuition. An indictment detail that gained particular attention charged that Hunter, a Marine Corps veteran who served in Iraq, told his wife to buy shorts for him from a golf pro shop so he could later claim the purchase was for golf balls for a wounded warrior event.\n\nHunter, 41, denied any wrongdoing and in a TV interview seemed to place the blame on his wife, saying she managed the campaign\u2019s finances. They have both pleaded not guilty and claimed the charges against them are politically motivated.\n\nThe corruption allegations put the seat in play and the 29-year-old Campa-Najjar aggressively sought support from Republicans disillusioned with the indicted incumbent. While running on his progressive platform, he tried to present his policies in ways that wouldn\u2019t alienate voters on the right.\n\nThe polls showing a tightening race, Hunter\u2019s campaign responded with a series of racist, misleading attack ads depicting Campa-Najjar as a \u201cradical Muslim\u201d trying to \u201cinfiltrate the U.S. government.\u201d\n\nAs part of the fear-mongering, the ads mentioned the Democrat\u2019s biological grandfather, a member of a Palestinian terrorist group who died 16 years before Campa-Najjar was born.\n\nA church-going Christian who quoted from the Bible during campaign events, Campa-Najjar also took to reminding voters that in order to work in the White House under Obama, he received a security clearance from the FBI.", "A visibly exhausted Beto O\u2019Rourke conceded the Texas Senate race Tuesday night, saying he was \u201cgrateful\u201d for his millions of supporters in the race against Republican incumbent Sen.

In Washington, Initiative 1631 \u2015 a ballot measure to enact a $15 per metric ton carbon fee, the revenues of which would have gone to public transit, solar- and wind-power plants and energy-efficiency retrofits \u2015 failed by double digits. It would have been the nation\u2019s first carbon tax. Coloradans, meanwhile, overwhelmingly voted down Proposition 112, a measure that would have put about 85 percent of non-federal land in the Centennial State off limits to oil and gas drilling. The industry spent upward of $73 million funding campaigns to reject the initiatives.\n\nSupporters of a Green New Deal are gaining power in the very election that\u2019s bleeding the bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus.

The chances of achieving those cuts seem slim.", "The Evergreen State\u2019s third and latest attempt to put a price on climate pollution failed Tuesday as voters rejected the historic ballot measure, notching yet another win for the oil and gas industry.\n\nThe measure, known as Initiative 1631, aimed to put a levy of $15 per metric ton of carbon dioxide emissions starting in January 2020. The fee would have increased $2 annually until the state met its goals for cutting heat-trapping gas pollution.\n\nThe revenue was designed to be directed toward projects accelerating the state\u2019s shift away from fossil fuels, including expanding public transit, energy-efficiency retrofits for big buildings and new wind- and solar-powered plants.\n\nWashington already tried to pass more traditional carbon taxes. In November 2016, voters rejected a proposal for a tax of $25 per metric ton of carbon dioxide, which aimed to cut the state sales tax 1 percent, fund a tax credit of up to $1,500 for low-income households and cut the tax rate for manufacturers. In March, a bill to enact a carbon tax escalating $1.80 per ton each year until hitting $30 in 2031 failed in the state Senate when it fell \u201cone or two votes short,\u201d prompting the sponsor to pull the legislation.\n\nBut Initiative 1631 took a different approach, imposing the carbon price in the form of a \u201cfee.\u201d Under Washington State law, a \u201cfee\u201d \u2015 as opposed to a tax \u2015 cannot be spent on government expenses such as public education or welfare, meaning all the revenue the fee raises must fund climate-related projects.\n\nThat put it more in line with the Green New Deal, a term progressive activists coined to describe a set of proposals for major government spending plans to mitigate the impacts of climate change. Scientists say such policies are necessary to make the kinds of emissions cuts required to avert the worst impacts of climate change. Just last month, a sobering United Nations report found that world government must halve global emissions over the next 12 years to avoid cataclysmic warming and that technologies to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere are still likely necessary.\n\nYet fears over rising gas prices proved more convincing to Evergreen State voters. The Western States Petroleum Association raised over $31 million \u2015 a record for Washington ballot initiatives \u2015 for its \u201cNo\u201d campaign, spending nearly $30 million of it by the start of this month. The campaign dispensed $10.8 million in the last two weeks of October alone.", "Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) won a contentious race for attorney general of Minnesota, making him one of the highest-ranking Muslim elected officials in the country.\n\nEllison, the deputy chairman of the Democratic National Committee, was accused of domestic violence in August. His former girlfriend Karen Monahan said Ellison had subjected her to \u201cnarcissist abuse\u201d and on one occasion had tried pulling her off a bed while cursing at her.\n\nEllison denied the allegation. And an investigation commissioned by the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, as Minnesota\u2019s Democratic Party is known, found the claim to be \u201cunsubstantiated.\u201d\n\nEllison\u2019s victory not only keeps Minnesota\u2019s top law enforcement post in Democratic hands at a time when blue states are erecting barriers to President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration and health care policies, but it also gives control of that post to one of the country\u2019s most influential progressive figures.\n\n\u201cKeith Ellison\u2019s career in Washington, D.C., as a member of Congress has been stellar,\u201d said Jeff Hauser, executive director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research\u2019s Revolving Door Project, who previously worked as a strategist at the AFL-CIO. \u201cHe has not just been a reliable vote for progressive ideas; he\u2019s been a source for progressive ideas.\u201d\n\nBrian Snyder / Reuters Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) addressing campaign volunteers on Oct. 27 in Minneapolis.\n\nEllison, 55, became the first Muslim member of Congress when he won his first race to represent Minneapolis and some surrounding towns in 2006. A former chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, he distinguished himself as an outspoken voice on economic justice and a progressive foreign policy. In March, he took over as the chief sponsor of the Medicare for all bill in the House.\n\nAt times, Ellison bucked Democratic Party leadership, like when he spearheaded a June 2015 revolt against then-President Barack Obama\u2019s effort to acquire the authority needed to fast-track free trade agreements.\n\nEllison announced he would run for attorney general in June, after Lori Swanson said she would enter the governor\u2019s race rather than seek re-election.\n\nIn keeping with his career as a populist champion, Ellison promised he would be \u201cthe People\u2019s Lawyer\u201d as state attorney general and defend civil rights, consumers, workers and the environment.\n\nMinnesota poll watchers predicted early on that Ellison would cruise to victory. Then, in August, days before the DFL primary, Monahan\u2019s son wrote a Facebook post detailing a video of an alleged altercation between Ellison and his mother.\n\nEllison went on to win the primary handily. The video mentioned by Monahan\u2019s son never materialized. Monahan maintained that the video existed, but offered shifting justifications for why she did not want to publicize it. A DFL-commissioned investigator cited Monahan\u2019s changing reasoning in its conclusion that the allegation could not be verified.\n\nBut Ellison\u2019s Republican opponent, Doug Wardlow, 40, lumped the allegation into a series of other attacks depicting Ellison as an \u201cextreme\u201d left-wing figure sympathetic to cop killers. On social media, some conservative Minnesotans began threatening to disrupt Ellison\u2019s campaign events. They also circulated photos of battered women they falsely linked to Ellison, as well as Islamophobic commentary claiming Muslims approve of spousal abuse.\n\nThe allegation, buttressed by Wardlow\u2019s attacks, had an impact. Despite other statewide Democratic candidates\u2019 strong leads in their races, polling showed Wardlow and Ellison were locked in a neck-and-neck contest as of late October.\n\nWardlow, who also served in the state legislature, said he would take \u201cpolitics\u201d out of the attorney general\u2019s office and merely enforce the state\u2019s laws.\n\nEllison ultimately benefited from Wardlow\u2019s record as a hard-line conservative ideologue. As a state lawmaker, Wardlow unsuccessfully proposed legislation that would have blocked the creation of a state insurance exchange under the Affordable Care Act, as well as a bill making Minnesota a right-to-work state.\n\nEllison trained his greatest fire on Wardlow\u2019s tenure at the Alliance Defending Freedom. The Democrat\u2019s campaign aired a television advertisement featuring the parents of a transgender child whose efforts to seek accommodation from their public school Wardlow fought vehemently.", "SIOUX CITY, Iowa \u2014 Rep. Steve King, a white supremacist, won a ninth term in Congress Tuesday night despite months of growing outrage over his bigoted statements and ties to extremist figures in the U.S. and overseas.\n\nKing beat Democrat J.D. Scholten, a former minor league baseball player and paralegal.\n\nThe longterm lawmaker had barely campaigned in the months leading up to Election Day, expecting another blowout victory in Iowa\u2019s 4th Congressional District. In that deeply conservative region in the northwest part of the state, King has routinely been re-elected by over 20 points.\n\nBut a poll last week showed King with just a one-point lead over Scholten, raising the real possibility of a big Democratic upset in a district that President Donald Trump carried by 27 points in 2016.\n\nThe poll came amidst increased media scrutiny of King\u2019s white nationalist views. In October, he endorsed a mayoral candidate in Toronto who has recited the \u201c14 words,\u201d a slogan used by neo-Nazis.\n\nAlso in October, HuffPost uncovered an interview that King had given to an Austrian publication with ties to neo-Nazis. In that interview, he discussed the \u201cGreat Replacement\u201d conspiracy theory \u2015 the belief that immigration, particularly from Muslim-majority countries, will mean the extinction of white European culture and identity. King also pushed the anti-Semitic idea that the liberal, Jewish billionaire George Soros \u2014 a frequent bogeyman of the far right \u2014 might be funding the \u201cGreat Replacement.\u201d\n\nKing\u2019s long history of bigotry came into sharp focus early last week after 11 worshippers inside a Pittsburgh synagogue were killed by an alleged white supremacist, who believed Jews were funding immigration by people of color into the U.S.\n\nRep. Steve Stivers of Ohio, who heads the National Republican Congressional Committee, issued a rare rebuke of King after the shooting. \u201cWe must stand up against white supremacy and hate in all forms, and I strongly condemn this behavior,\u201d Stivers said in a statement.\n\nMajor companies that had contributed to King\u2019s campaigns \u2014 including Purina, Land O\u2019 Lakes, Intel, AT&T and Smithfield Foods \u2014 announced they would no longer financially support the congressman.\n\nAt a candidate forum hosted by the Greater Des Moines Partnership, King lashed out at an Iowa resident who pressed him on on the similarity between King\u2019s anti-immigration beliefs and those of the Pittsburgh shooter.\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League wrote a letter to House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), urging Ryan to formally censure King and strip him of a House subcommittee chairmanship. \u201cBy doing so, you will make clear that his actions were deeply offensive, wrong, and that the U.S. House of Representatives will not tolerate anti-Semitism or bigotry in any form,\u201d wrote Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the ADL.\n\nThe editorial board at the Sioux City Journal in Iowa, which has repeatedly endorsed King in prior elections, endorsed Scholten on Friday. \u201cThose were not easy words for us to write,\u201d the board said of its decision.\n\nSteve King blows up at questioner who pressed him on the Pittsburgh massacre #IA04 pic.twitter.com/7sFQyY9fOW \u2014 Iowa Starting Line (@IAStartingLine) November 1, 2018\n\nMeanwhile, Scholten \u2014 who had campaigned for months driving around the district in an RV \u2014 enjoyed a surge in donations, raking in $641,000 during one 48-hour period last week.\n\nIn a fundraising email, King blamed his campaign troubles on a \u201cradical leftist mob\u201d that \u201cis completely out of control.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy opponent is the antithesis (the opposite) of Iowa values,\u201d he added in a tweet. \u201cMy record proves I embody them. Don\u2019t let the million$ from Left Coast billionaires pay in advance and buy your Congressman.\u201d\n\nKing released his first television spot of the campaign on Friday, only a few days before the election. It was a recycled ad that he had used in 2014.\n\nThis week, King returned to his habit of making bigoted remarks, criticizing the National Republican Congressional Committee for supporting a candidate for Congress who is gay.\n\n\u201cThey sent money over to support a candidate in a primary in California who had a same-sex partner that they put all over glossy mailers,\u201d King said at a campaign event. \u201cThat\u2019s hard to write a check to those guys when they do that, so I\u2019m hoping we get conservative leadership in the House.\u201d\n\nYet Iowa Republicans came to King\u2019s defense on Monday. Sen. Chuck Grassley gave a statement in support of the congressman. King was also welcomed at a Sioux Center campaign rally Monday night for Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds, where he spoke to a crowd of a few hundred people in support of Reynolds and other GOP candidates in Iowa.", "Republicans fought the health care law and the health care law won.\n\nIt was a close call, closer perhaps than many people realized. Had Republicans kept control of Congress in this year\u2019s midterm elections, they would almost certainly have made another attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act. If anything, the result might have emboldened them, by convincing them that they could survive the kind of political backlash that their failed 2017 effort produced.\n\nBut as of Tuesday evening, Republicans were set to lose their majority in the House of Representatives, with only the size of a new Democratic majority in question. And health care was a big reason why Republicans performed as badly as they did.\n\nThis was an election about immigration and the environment, Brett Kavanaugh and Donald Trump, but voters consistently told pollsters that health care was foremost on their minds.\n\nAnd it was the GOP\u2019s repeal effort specifically that ended up causing the party so many problems, in no small part because Democrats did everything they could to make it an issue. In district after district, state after state, Republicans came under withering attack for trying to take away Medicaid and, especially, for trying to take away protections for people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nRepublicans tried to change the subject and, when that wouldn\u2019t work, they decided their best strategy was to lie \u2015 to pretend they hadn\u2019t spent eight years trying to strip away those pre-existing condition protections and the rest of the Affordable Care Act with it.\n\nThose arguments may have helped some Republican Senate candidates win close races. But they didn\u2019t save the GOP\u2019s House majority, which means the health care law has all but surely survived yet another near-death experience \u2015 the latest in a string of trials that includes the Democrats losing their filibuster-proof Senate majority in 2010, a pair of Supreme Court cases in 2012 and 2015, the failed launch of the online insurance markets in 2013, and most recently the GOP repeal effort of 2017.\n\nIn fact, the most immediate, practical consequence of the election could be something quite the opposite of repeal. A few hundred thousand more people could get health insurance through Medicaid, because states that had resisted the Affordable Care Act\u2019s expansion of the program could finally be joining.\n\nBallot initiatives to expand the program, as 33 states plus the District of Columbia have already done, won in Idaho, Nebraska and Utah Tuesday. A measure to renew an existing expansion program in another conservative state, Montana, failed.\n\nMedicaid expansion could also come to one other traditionally conservative state, Kansas. The state legislature approved legislation to expand the program last year, only to have then-Gov. Sam Brownback (R) veto it.\n\nOn Tuesday, Republican Kris Kobach lost his gubernatorial bid to Democrat Laura Kelly. She has pledged to approve an expansion bill within her first year of office.\n\nRepublicans Haven\u2019t Given Up \u2015 And May Never Give Up\n\nDespite these results, nobody familiar with the history of the 2010 law, or health care policy more generally, would assume that fights over the program are over \u2015 or that it is sure to be standing a few years from now.\n\nA lawsuit from 20 Republican state officials claiming that the law is unconstitutional now sits before a federal judge in Texas. The merits of the case are weak, as even longtime Affordable Care Act critics concede. But it\u2019s entirely possible it will prevail, setting up future appeals and perhaps injecting yet more chaos into insurance markets, because the judge is a conservative Republican appointee and the lawsuit has the backing of Trump\u2019s Justice Department.\n\nIt\u2019s an unusual move. Typically the Justice Department would defend a federal law, even if the administration in power doesn\u2019t like it.\n\nBut the decision to join was just one example of the ways the Trump administration has found to use executive authority to undermine the law, something it will continue to do as long as it controls the executive branch. While the state officials are seeking to get the entire law thrown out, Attorney General Jeff Sessions asked the judge to only invalidate the provisions of the law protecting people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nJust last month, the Trump administration announced it would be proposing new regulations that would give states leeway to rewrite the rules of their own insurance markets, by scaling back the regulations on pre-existing conditions and even allocating financial assistance differently. This was the administration\u2019s latest move to weaken the Affordable Care Act\u2019s consumer protections. Trump\u2019s government also severely cut back on health insurance exchange outreach and enrollment programs.\n\nThe Trump administration and Republican-led states will be able to continue such efforts and to impose restrictions on Medicaid eligibility. The administration already has approved plans in Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, New Hampshire and Wisconsin that impose work requirements on some adult Medicaid beneficiaries (although a court struck down Kentucky\u2019s plan). Nine other states have applied for work requirements the administration is almost certain to okay.\n\nThe reality is that Republicans will never stop trying to weaken, undermine and ultimately eliminate the Affordable Care Act, just as they have never given up on trying to privatize Medicare and dramatically cut Medicaid.\n\nBut the Medicare example is instructive, because it shows what happens when a program has become too popular to dislodge. Republicans portray themselves as defenders of Medicare, even as they are trying to scale back and transform it into a private program, because they know that a frontal, unambiguous political assault would invite such a strong popular backlash.\n\nThis election may signal that the Affordable Care Act has reached the same threshold or is at least getting a lot closer. The program still isn\u2019t as popular, with polls showing that only small majorities have favorable views of it, but that\u2019s an improvement over what the same polls showed just two years ago.\n\nIt may be that by trying to repeal the health care law, the law\u2019s critics have done what it never could do on its own: shore up support not just for the law\u2019s specific provisions, but for the very idea that people should get health care even if they are sick and even if they can\u2019t pay for that care on their own.\n\nNot that the Affordable Care Act has actually realized that goal. The number of people without health insurance is at historic lows, but many millions still have no coverage and even among those with insurance, many millions are struggling to pay their bills.\n\nSome are in trouble because they make too much money to qualify for financial assistance and the comprehensive insurance sold under Affordable Care Act regulations, with its guarantees of benefits for all, is too expensive for them to afford on their own.\n\nOthers are in trouble because they have employer-sponsored coverage and the out-of-pocket costs keep getting higher. This isn\u2019t a problem that Obamacare created so much as one it didn\u2019t solve: Health care still costs more in America than it does in any other country.\n\nWhere Democrats Might Go From Here\n\nNow that Democrats control congressional committees, one of their main focuses will be using subpoena power to oversee, and investigate, how the Trump administration is managing federal health programs.\n\nLikely topics for investigation include the Trump administration\u2019s decisions to cut that outreach spending; to allow states so much leeway in rewriting their insurance market rules; and to grant requests for work requirements and other limitations on Medicaid coverage. Some of these choices involved questionable uses of executive authority and that is precisely the sort of thing Democratic congressional committees would want to scrutinize.\n\nBut there\u2019s a presidential election coming in two years and, at least within the Democratic Party, this campaign is likely to feature a conversation that started in the last one \u2015 when Bernie Sanders, the independent senator from Vermont, made his proposal for a single-payer, \u201cMedicare for All\u201d system a centerpiece of his 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nSince that time, more than a dozen Democratic senators, including many presidential hopefuls, have endorsed the idea. Some of them have joined colleagues in promoting alternative plans that also envision large expansions of government-run insurance, along with government control over health care prices, but would not change the system as radically as would the Sanders plan.\n\nThe common element in these ideas is an effort to complete the party\u2019s work, from enactment of Medicare up through the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, to make sure everybody can get health care.\n\nWhether they settle eventually on something that could be called Medicare for All or opt for a more modest approach that includes some mix of more subsidies, government control over prices and new government-run insurance programs, a Democratic House could be the proving ground for these ideas and the place where the party will have to coalesce about what to do next.\n\nRepublicans will be part of this debate, too. During the final weeks of the 2018 campaign, Republicans tried to make Medicare for All a big issue \u2015 insisting that all Democrats supported it and then insisting it would destroy American health care, and Medicare itself in particular. Those attacks might resonate more in the coming months or coming years. They might not.\n\nEither way, they don\u2019t give Republicans what they have always lacked and apparently still lack: a conservative health care plan that would result in health care for more people, not fewer. And the American public seems to grasp that, even though health care is such an infamously confusing subject.\n\nIt goes a long way to explaining why Trump and his Republicans aren\u2019t claiming victory after Tuesday night, and why millions of people who have gotten health care through the Affordable Care Act will get to keep it \u2015 at least for now.\n\nThis article has been updated to reflect the final result of a ballot initiative in Montana to retain the state\u2019s Medicaid expansion.", "UPDATE: The Florida Senate race between incumbent Democrat Bill Nelson and Gov. Rick Scott (R) is heading for a recount that could begin as soon as Wednesday.\n\nScott claimed victory Tuesday night, but Nelson said Wednesday that he would not concede.\n\nFlorida state law triggers a recount ordered by the secretary of state when the margin of victory is 0.5 percent or less. According to unofficial results, Scott leads Nelson by 0.42 percent.\n\nPREVIOUSLY:\n\nFlorida Gov. Rick Scott has ousted Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson, a big step toward Republicans\u2019 hopes of hanging onto and even building on their majority in the U.S. Senate.\n\nScott, 65, will join Marco Rubio in Washington in January, giving the state two Republican senators for the first time since Reconstruction. Nelson, 76, had been seeking his fourth six-year term following his stint as the state\u2019s insurance commissioner and, before that, 12 years in the House as a congressman from the Space Coast.\n\nScott is finishing out two terms as the state\u2019s chief executive and could not seek a third because of term limits. He was seen as among the GOP\u2019s strongest recruits to take away Democratic-held Senate seats, and his victory likely makes it impossible for Democrats to win back the chamber this election.\n\nScott\u2019s two previous election victories had been squeakers \u2015 1.1 percentage points each time \u2015 and his Senate victory will likely be even narrower, less than 1 percentage point, by the time all the votes are counted.\n\nFlorida now has three times elected to statewide office the man who in the 1990s ran the for-profit hospital chain that agreed to pay $1.7 billion in fines for systematically defrauding Medicare, Medicaid and veterans health programs. Scott invoked his Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate oneself 75 times during a deposition in a related civil trial about his role in the fraud committed by Columbia/HCA.\n\nTHE ASSOCIATED PRESS Gov. Rick Scott has beat Sen. Bill Nelson to give Florida two GOP senators.\n\nDuring Scott\u2019s first run for governor in 2010, both his Republican opponent in the primary and Democratic nominee Alex Sink used that history in negative ads against him. But Scott was willing to spend freely from his personal fortune of hundreds of millions of dollars and managed to eke out narrow wins against both.\n\nIn 2014, Scott barely won re-election against Charlie Crist, who had been the Republican governor before Scott but had since become a Democrat.\n\nIn fact, Scott\u2019s popularity only broke 50 percent on a consistent basis in 2017, after his generally well-regarded handling of Hurricane Irma. That improvement in his polling numbers, in addition to his continued willingness to spend heavily on his own campaigns, made national Republicans believe that Scott had a good chance of defeating Nelson, whose two previous re-elections had been against weak opponents.\n\nAll that, though, was before this summer, when red tide worsened along the southwest coast of Florida and blooms of thick, blue-green algae from Lake Okeechobee began choking Fort Myers on the Gulf of Mexico and Stuart on the Atlantic Ocean. When the freshwater algae hits salt water at the coast, it dies, releasing toxins into the water and air \u2015 and, scientists believe, providing additional food for the naturally occurring red tide bacteria. The result has been the deaths of millions of fish, sea turtles, dolphins and manatees, with their carcasses washing up on beaches and adding the stench of decay to air already acrid from the red tide toxins.\n\nMany environmentalists blamed Scott for the calamity. He had slashed budgets for the agencies responsible for safeguarding the water quality in Lake Okeechobee and eased enforcement efforts against polluters.\n\nScott faced protests late this summer at campaign stops in Fort Myers and Venice \u2015 both Republican strongholds. He largely refrained from coastal campaign visits as the red tide spread up Florida\u2019s eastern coast, and then he stopped campaigning altogether after Hurricane Michael struck the Panhandle last month.\n\nScott, though, had the advantage of running for the Senate as a sitting governor. Governors of a state are well known to voters and are able to take credit for day-to-day accomplishments, while senators have nowhere near that level of visibility. The last incumbent senator to lose election in Florida, in fact, was defeated by a sitting governor: Democrat Bob Graham ousted Republican Sen. Paula Hawkins in 1986.", "WASHINGTON \u2015 After eight unforgiving years in the minority, Democrats will once again control the House of Representatives, with a deeply divided nation handing their party a narrow advantage of around 10 seats in the House.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t quite the wave that Democrats were hoping for. Even with a 9-point advantage in the popular vote, Republicans fended off the worst-case scenarios in the House and actually improved their majority in the Senate, as Indiana, Missouri and Florida \u2015 states that voted for President Donald Trump in 2016 \u2015 sent their Democratic senators packing.\n\nBut both parties will still be able to claim victories Tuesday. Democrats picking up the House effectively slows Trump\u2019s presidency to a legislative crawl, while Republicans will point to their gains in the Senate to say voters still prefer their stark vision of governance.\n\nIn fact, one of the major lessons for Republicans may be that they need to embrace Trump\u2019s style even more. A blue wave for Democrats never really materialized because Republicans were able to energize their own voters through a campaign full of racial anxiety and culture war items.\n\nEven with Democrats looking likely to pick up around 30 seats in the House, it\u2019s perhaps most notable how many GOP members were able to survive. It took Republicans trying to undermine popular protections for people with pre-existing medical conditions, the passage of an unpopular tax cut bill, and the reality of Trump for Democrats to recapture the House \u2015 and Democrats were only able to barely achieve that goal.\n\nWhere Democrats did pick up seats, their gains were mostly in areas where Hillary Clinton had already beaten Donald Trump in 2016, though Democrats did flip districts all across the nation. They took three seats in Virginia, three seats in Pennsylvania, two seats in Texas, and a smattering of seats from New York, Iowa, Illinois and New Jersey \u2015 with dozens of races to still be called.\n\nDemocrats also had a few upsets on the night, flipping the Trump-friendly area of Staten Island and even a district in long-red Oklahoma. But their gains were mostly in the suburban, affluent, educated areas that Democrats have already increasingly turned blue.\n\nThe primary message from Democrats during the 2018 campaign \u2015 that they would protect health care for the sick while Republicans would undermine it \u2015 did seem to resonate across the country. Democrats used almost every opportunity they could to redirect conversations back to health care. They also channeled frustration with a historically unpopular president into grassroots energy that propelled them back to power in a number of districts that Democrats haven\u2019t represented in years, in some cases decades, like the Virginia district where Democrat Abigail Spanberger defeated Republican Dave Brat in a district that a Democrat hasn\u2019t represented since 1970.\n\nBut again, Republicans kept the majority of their tossup seats by appealing to their GOP base voters. In states like Florida where Republicans could have lost a number of seats, the GOP ended up only losing in areas where Democrats were already popular. A governor\u2019s race that pitted the Democratic base\u2019s energy \u2015 channeled into candidate Andrew Gillum \u2015 against Trump\u2019s base, with Republican candidate Ron DeSantis, showed that Republicans had the advantage.\n\nRepublicans had initially tried a different messaging strategy. They tried to sell their tax cut package as a major victory for voters, arguing that the strong economy was a byproduct of their policies.\n\nBut with polls consistently showing the legislation\u2019s popularity in the low 40s, Republicans eventually began campaigning on the more culture war-ish, racially tinged messages that kept a wave at bay.\n\nThe GOP bet it could withstand the worst effects of a Democratic wave by embracing Trump\u2019s playbook and exciting their own voters \u2015 and Republicans were mostly right.\n\nUltimately, whether Pelosi can become speaker again will depend on the exact composition of the House and whether she can get some Democrats to go back on the soft promises they made to their constituents that they would not support her for speaker.\n\nStill, recapturing the House is a huge achievement for Democrats as they look to curb the worst effects of Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\nDemocrats almost certainly won\u2019t go along with GOP attempts to gut the Affordable Care Act. They likely won\u2019t make the tax cuts permanent as Republicans want. And \u2015 as was already the case \u2015 they won\u2019t give Trump his signature border wall without major concessions on the Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals program.\n\nInstead, Democrats have said, they\u2019ll put forward an infrastructure package meant to tempt some moderate Republicans and the president. They\u2019ll offer their own legislation on DACA and dare Trump to oppose it. And they\u2019ll conduct more rigorous oversight of the president, though there are already questions about how far Democrats would push possible impeachment proceedings.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has made it clear that, under her leadership, impeaching Trump is \u201cnot a priority.\u201d But that could change with new revelations from the Robert Mueller investigation or from congressional oversight \u2015 and Pelosi\u2019s position as the top Democrat in the House isn\u2019t certain either.\n\nA number of the Democrats who won Tuesday \u2015 including Spanberger in Virginia, Jason Crow in Colorado, Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey and Anthony Brindisi in New York \u2015 have said they won\u2019t support Pelosi to be the next speaker. And with what could still be a narrow majority for Democrats, Pelosi\u2019s grip on the speaker\u2019s gavel is very loose. She\u2019s long faced pressure from existing Democrats in her caucus \u2015 such as Tim Ryan of Ohio, Seth Moulton of Massachusetts and Jim Cooper of Tennessee \u2015 to relinquish her position as the No. 1 Democrat in the House.\n\nUltimately, whether Pelosi can become speaker again will depend on the exact composition of the House and whether she can get some Democrats to go back on the soft promises they made to their constituents that they would not support her for speaker.", "Tap here to turn on desktop notifications to get the news sent straight to you.", "Democrats may be ecstatic that they retook the House of Representatives, but their decisive victory conceals a harsher reality: It took a landslide in the popular vote to get them here, and they are projected to lose seats in the Senate.\n\nThose facts speak to just how far the U.S. election system is tilted in the Republicans\u2019 favor. Through a combination of fundamental factors and partisan gerrymandering, Republicans on Tuesday retained their grip on the Senate and many state houses without a national majority.\n\nBecause the process of redrawing political maps will not begin until after 2020, House Democrats will have to defend their gains on the same, skewed playing field. Ahead of Tuesday\u2019s election, various forecasts posited Democrats would have to beat Republicans by roughly 5.5, 7, or even 11 points in the general vote just to win a slim majority of seats in the House.\n\nIf it requires a generational wave to give Democrats [the House], that\u2019s a sign of just how powerful gerrymandering is, not a sign that it can be conquered. David Daley, author of \"Ratf**cked\"\n\n\u201cIf it requires a generational wave to give Democrats [the House], that\u2019s a sign of just how powerful gerrymandering is, not a sign that it can be conquered,\u201d said David Daley, the author of Ratf**cked, a chronicle of the GOP\u2019s aggressive gerrymandering efforts. \u201cWinning back the House does nothing to change that structural unfairness in the future.\u201d\n\nCertain factors give Republicans a natural advantage. In the Senate, the disproportionate representation of small states is part of the body\u2019s original design. But that advantage, which benefits white voters, has become more lopsided than the framers of the Constitution likely ever imagined as the country\u2019s population and demographics evolve. Today, 20 senators from urban states represent roughly half the country\u2019s population, while the other, rural half elects the remaining 80.\n\nThe House presents similar challenges. Many other democracies ensure that a party\u2019s control of the legislature corresponds to its share of the vote. But the United States has a winner-take-all system. Netting 40 percent of the vote in every district would result in a total loss; winning 80 percent of the vote in every district would be no different than winning 51 percent in every district.\n\nAgain, the benefit redounds mostly to white, rural voters likely to vote Republican. Because Democratic voters are concentrated in cities, it is inevitable that more of them will find their votes \u201cwasted\u201d \u2014 that is, packed into bright-blue districts. And over the past several decades, voters have sorted themselves so that the urban-rural partisan divide is even starker.\n\nXinhua News Agency via Getty Images Voters register at a polling station in New York on Nov. 6.\n\nRepublicans have inflated their House advantage through the use of gerrymandering. A wave of Republican victories in 2010 allowed the party to dominate the most recent redistricting process, which Republicans used to protect their advantage from the political equivalent of a 100-year flood.\n\nIn Michigan, for example \u2014 ostensibly a swing state \u2014 Democrats could have matched their exceptional performances in 2006 and 2008 and still failed to flip a single congressional seat, Brennan Center researchers argued before Election Day. Republicans controlled nine out of Michigan\u2019s 14 congressional seats heading into Tuesday. As of early Wednesday morning, Democrats had flipped one seat.\n\n\u201cIn the long run, we\u2019re moving toward a world where Democrats can routinely get a majority of the vote and still not be able to gain meaningful electoral power,\u201d argued David Shor, the head of political data science at Civis Analytics, a Democratic consulting firm.\n\nThe third branch of the federal government exaggerates all of these Republican advantages like a funhouse mirror. Conservatives enjoy a five-justice majority on the Supreme Court, with the help of four justices appointed by presidents who initially entered office after losing the popular vote. The senators who approved Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination represented 38 million fewer constituents than those who opposed, according to Congress-tracking site GovTrack.us.\n\nFor anyone worried about the impact of gerrymandering, Tuesday offered a few reasons for hope. Several states considered ballot initiatives that will give nonpartisan groups some power over redistricting in 2021. (Two of those states \u2014 Michigan and Ohio \u2014 were states where the GOP wave of 2010 led to highly partisan maps.)\n\nIn Colorado, voters approved a proposal to turn the process over to bipartisan or independent citizens commissions; Michigan voters did the same. Utah voters on Tuesday night seemed on the verge of creating an independent advisory commission to work with the legislature. Missouri voters approved a statistical test to measure partisan fairness. Ohio\u2019s ballot measure requires new maps to involve bipartisan cooperation, but it still gives the majority party the ability to draw lines in its favor.\n\nAnd voters in Florida restored voting rights to 1.4 million people with prior felony convictions, a huge expansion of the franchise that could radically redistribute voting power in that state.\n\nThe new rules should produce a more equitable remap in 2021 \u2014 so long as neither party finds a way to undermine them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always possible for people with bad intentions to find a workaround,\u201d Daley said. He noted how, after Florida voters approved a 2010 ban on partisan gerrymandering, the Republican-controlled legislature drew partisan boundaries anyway. Two election cycles passed before the courts struck down the most gerrymandered districts.\n\nThe new rules should produce a more equitable remap in 2021 \u2014 so long as neither party finds a way to undermine them.\n\nBut fair election advocates worry that Tuesday\u2019s outcome won\u2019t change much of anything in the long run.\n\n\u201cWhat you\u2019re describing could sooner or later lead to a quite massive withdrawal of support if [voters] in the majority come to the conclusion that in some deep sense, elections don\u2019t really matter,\u201d said Sanford Levinson, a politics professor and constitutional critic at the University of Texas.\n\nAlthough their victory in the House may have staved off disenchantment among Democrats, Levinson said, it will have the opposite effect for Republicans if Trump reacts with his usual air of conspiracy.\n\n\u201cNo democracy can operate if the losers aren\u2019t good sports,\u201d Levinson said. \u201cAnd what Donald Trump has done is create a situation where many of his supporters, the Trump base, are being trained to be bad sports. \u2018You can\u2019t trust the press, the system is rigged, George Soros is the secret mastermind, so if the Republicans lose the House, don\u2019t believe it was the result of a fair process.\u2019\u201d", "Tap here to turn on desktop notifications to get the news sent straight to you.", "Michigan voters on Tuesday approved a constitutional amendment intended to make it drastically easier to cast a ballot in the state.\n\nVoters in the state will now be automatically registered to vote when they interact with the state\u2019s motor vehicle agency unless they opt out. They\u2019ll also be able to register to vote on Election Day, as opposed to the state\u2019s current registration cut-off of 30 days before an election. The amendment also allows people to vote for an entire party\u2019s slate of candidate with a single notation \u2015 a practice called straight-ticket voting, which the state banned two years ago.\n\nMichiganders also now have an explicit constitutional right to cast a secret ballot and to have statewide elections audited. Voters under 60 no longer need an excuse to vote absentee.\n\nThe new amendment also requires overseas and military voters to get their ballots 45 days before an election. That element is in response to concerns that the state hasn\u2019t been sending those ballots to voters early enough (federal law requires overseas voters get their ballots for federal elections in the same time period).\n\nThe victory comes amid a handful of attempts to expand voting rights through ballot initiatives. There was a separate Michigan ballot measure on Tuesday to create an independent commission to handle electoral districts. In Florida, there was a ballot measure to expand voting rights to around 1.4 million people with a felony conviction.\n\nA coalition of voting groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union, League of Women Voters and the NAACP, backed the measure.", "The lowest-paid workers across Missouri will see their hourly wages increase soon, thanks to a ballot measure passed Tuesday.\n\nA majority of voters approved an initiative that will gradually raise the wage floor throughout the state to $12 per hour. The Missouri minimum wage, currently set at $7.85, will bump to $8.60 next year, then increase 85 cents each year thereafter until it reaches $12 in 2023. After that, it would rise or fall each year according to an inflation index.\n\nVoters in Arkansas also approved a minimum wage ballot measure Tuesday, raising it to $11 by 2021.\n\nThe passage of the raise in Missouri comes a little over a year after Republicans in the statehouse passed a law blocking all minimum wage increases attempted by localities. That law was meant to pre-empt higher minimum wages in cities like St. Louis and Kansas City. But now, barring any maneuvers by Republicans at the Capitol, the wage floor will be higher everywhere in Missouri.\n\nThe passage of Proposition B, as the measure was known, marks the second major ballot-box victory for unions and worker groups in Missouri this year, after they succeeded in blocking the state\u2019s recently passed right-to-work law in August. The minimum wage increase will be the first significant one in Missouri since a referendum passed in 2006.\n\nThe federal minimum wage is $7.25 per hour and hasn\u2019t risen since 2009, but more and more states have chosen to hike their own wage floors, either through legislation or the ballot box. Such proposals tend to be very popular with the general public, with support for raising the minimum wage typically crossing party lines.\n\nThe Missouri Chamber of Commerce and Industry said earlier this year that it would be difficult to beat back Proposition B. The business lobby\u2019s president acknowledged it was \u201ca more modest increase than you\u2019ve seen in other states and regions,\u201d given the success of the Fight for $15, the union-backed campaign to create a $15 minimum wage.\n\nThe proposition passed Tuesday was put on the ballot by a group called Raise Up Missouri, which received around $5 million in contributions, much of which came from labor unions and nonprofits. The measure picked up the support of prominent Democrats in the state, including Sen. Claire McCaskill and the mayors of St. Louis and Kansas City.\n\nA full-time worker earning the minimum wage in Missouri makes around $16,300 per year right now. After the raises go into effect, a worker with the same amount of hours would be earning roughly $25,000 in 2023.\n\nSome cities in Missouri have tried to raise the minimum wage on their own, only to be stymied by Republicans in the state Capitol. In May 2017, they passed what\u2019s known as a \u201cpreemption\u201d law that forbids cities and counties from deviating from the state minimum wage.\n\nBut afterward, workers who had supported the local minimum wage campaigns vowed to get their revenge on lawmakers through a statewide referendum that would have far more impact.

Cox, a businessman who had the support of President Donald Trump, trailed Newsom in the polls by double digits for most of the race.\n\nThe lieutenant governor, who previously served as mayor of San Francisco, was viewed as the inevitable front-runner as soon as he announced his candidacy in February 2015. Several challengers entered the race over the next couple of years, including Cox, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa (D), state treasurer John Chiang (D) and state Assemblyman Travis Allen (R).\n\nReuters California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) has won the state's gubernatorial race.\n\nOf those challengers, Villaraigosa was initially seen as the most viable. The former mayor had a strong support base in Southern California, where Bay Area native Newsom\u2019s ties were weaker, as well as the backing of many Latino voters. But Cox\u2019s candidacy surged in the waning days of the primary, thanks in part to Trump\u2019s endorsement lifting him out of political obscurity. Newsom also boosted Cox\u2019s candidacy by promoting his Trump endorsement in ads and text messages to voters, a strategy seen by some Democrats as a cynical calculation to avoid a costly intraparty general election.\n\nRegardless of whether that tactic made a difference with Republican voters, Cox did advance along with Newsom to the general election. The ensuing race drew little attention outside of the state, as most political observers anticipated Newsom\u2019s dominance in solidly blue California.\n\nThe race, like many across the country, was largely a referendum on Trump. Newsom frequently mentioned the president on the campaign trail and pitched himself as the best person to lead the state in challenging his policies. Cox, meanwhile, touted himself as the choice for the \u201cforgotten Californian,\u201d echoing the message the president gave white, working-class voters in 2016. But while the Republican did embrace the president\u2019s messaging during the primary, he kept him at arms-length during the general election. Trump didn\u2019t campaign in California for Cox, despite holding large rallies for many other GOP candidates across the country over the last few weeks, and Cox publicly kept his distance from Trump on some issues, such as when he declined to say whether he supported Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation.", "Republicans ran racist attack ad after racist attack ad against Antonio Delgado, a Rhodes Scholar and first-time Democratic candidate vying to upset GOP Rep.

Other candidates in both parties took the traditional path of making visits to county fairs, local party dinners and civic groups to build up support across the state. DeSantis, though, essentially ran his campaign from the Fox News studio near the Capitol, appearing several times a week to defend Trump on issues ranging from the Russia investigation to the promised border wall.\n\nThose performances endeared DeSantis with Republican primary voters in Florida who watch Fox regularly, but they did little to improve the congressman\u2019s name recognition among independent voters and did nothing to hone his positions on Florida-specific issues.\n\nIt turns out that did not matter.

A larger majority in the Senate means Republicans will have an easier time confirming the president\u2019s choices.\n\nRepublicans argued the rancorous, monthlong debate over the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the high court helped drive up enthusiasm among their base ahead of Election Day. Indeed, several Democrats up for re-election red states saw their poll numbers dip in October following the confirmation hearings.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats energized the Republican Party in a way we\u2019ve never been able to do,\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said of the Kavanaugh hearings during an interview with radio host Hugh Hewitt earlier this week.\n\nBoth Republicans and Democrats have talked up the prospect of bipartisan compromise on infrastructure next year. But while they agree on the need to overhaul the nation\u2019s crumbling roads, bridges and waterways, they don\u2019t see eye to eye on how to pay for it.\n\nLawmakers spent little time jousting over spending in Trump\u2019s first two years in office because most Republicans dropped their doomsaying about the nation\u2019s deficit and embraced big budget bills. That will probably change in the next Congress.", "Massachusetts residents have voted to keep in place legislation that prohibits discrimination on the basis of gender identity, a major victory for the state\u2019s transgender community and their allies.\n\nBay Staters voted \u201cyes\u201d on Question 3, saving a 2-year-old state law that shields transgender people from discrimination in public places, including restaurants, hospitals and gyms.\n\nThe ballot question marked the country\u2019s first statewide referendum on transgender rights. Opponents of the anti-discrimination law have argued that it puts women at risk in public bathrooms. But a study released in September by the Williams Institute at UCLA School of Law contradicts that claim. It compared the number of crimes reported in public restrooms, locker rooms and dressing rooms the year the law was enacted and the year prior, and found no difference.\n\nTransgender activists, including actress Laverne Cox, tirelessly rallied in support of the legislation in the weeks leading up to the midterms.\n\n\u201cMassachusetts has an opportunity to send a message to this administration, has an opportunity to send a message to the rest of the country that this is not who we are as Americans, that this is not who we are as human beings, that we respect the humanity of everyone,\u201d Cox said last month at a rally for the \u201cYes on 3\u2033 campaign in Boston.\n\nThe vote comes on the heels of several anti-trans policies floated by President Donald Trump\u2019s administration, including barring trans soldiers from the military and narrowly defining sex so it would be determined by a person\u2019s genitalia at birth.\n\nTransgender activists feared repealing the law could have triggered similar referendums in other states.\n\nChase Strangio, a transgender staff attorney at the ACLU\u2019s LGBT & HIV Project, reinforced how crucial the law\u2019s passage was to trans people in Massachusetts.", "EL PASO \u2015 Democrat Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s bid for Senate seat in a reliably red state ended in defeat on Tuesday, dashing the hopes of progressives in Texas and beyond who had yearned for a Congress free of Republican Ted Cruz.\n\n\u201cI am as inspired, as hopeful, as I have ever been in my life, and tonight\u2019s loss does nothing to diminish the way that I feel about Texas or this country,\u201d O\u2019Rourke told disappointed supporters at a packed Southwest University Park stadium in El Paso after conceding. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to define ourselves by who or what we\u2019re against or afraid of, or scared of.\u201d\n\nBrianna Nevarez, 21, cast the first ballot of her life in this election after her mother inspired her to take an interest in the O\u2019Rourke campaign. Her father, a veteran and lifelong Republican, also voted for the Democratic underdog.\n\n\u201cI want to cry,\u201d Nevarez said. \u201cI had so much hope.\u201d\n\nDespite a parade of celebratory national media coverage and a whopping $70 million in donations \u2015 including a record haul from small donors and no money from corporate political action committees \u2015 polls had consistently shown the odds were against O\u2019Rourke\u2019s chances of derailing Cruz\u2019s re-election. O\u2019Rourke, 46, narrowed the gap in several surveys in the campaign\u2019s waning days, but never closed it.\n\nInstead, Republicans continue to dominate the major political offices in a state whose changing demographics have made it majority-minority but whose electorate retains a conservative tilt. The GOP hasn\u2019t lost a statewide election since 1994.\n\nChip Somodevilla via Getty Images A quixotic Senate campaign by Rep. Beto O'Rourke surprised many observers by attracting national attention and massive financial support. Still, he failed to unseat conservative stalwart Ted Cruz.\n\n\u201cThe expectations of dramatic, huge partisan shifts are just unrealistic,\u201d University of Texas at Austin political scientist James Henson said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign was significant not just for the amount of attention it grabbed, but because it attracted any national interest at all.\n\nDemocrats seeking statewide office in Texas are used to losing by margins of 20 percentage points or more \u2015 a trend that has made prominent party members unlikely to jump into races they have little confidence in winning. This year, several of the best-known liberal names in the state \u2015 including Julian Castro, who is scouting a run for the presidency \u2015 passed on runs for the Senate seat or the governor\u2019s office.\n\nBut the enthusiasm aroused by O\u2019Rourke\u2019s quixotic campaign, which was on track to narrow the margin of defeat to under 4 percentage points with 87 percent of precincts tallied, promises to shake up Texas politics in the years to come.\n\nOn Tuesday, thousands of O\u2019Rourke supporters \u2015 some of whom had traveled from cities hundreds of miles away \u2015 chanted \u201cBe-to! Be-to!\u201d as they packed into Southwest University Park to witness what they hoped would be a historic event.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to be the one to pull it off,\u201d Houston retiree Dorothea Stern said as the night began.\n\nTrue to form for a bilingual politician who represents an overwhelmingly Latino district, the night began with live cumbia music, with the band dedicating a song to the migrant children locked up in the nearby tent camp in Tornillo.\n\nThe mood quickly faded. After running neck-and-neck with Cruz as the early voting ballot counts trickled out from the secretary of state, O\u2019Rourke\u2019s chances of victory evaporated as the night progressed. Some supporters refused to believe it, insisting that Cruz\u2019s lead would narrow as the night wore on. Others despaired.\n\nBut O\u2019Rourke\u2019s high-profile battle with Cruz will likely improve Democratic prospects for recruiting better candidates and cause party leaders to view the state as more competitive.\n\n\u201cIt will embolden people,\u201d said Jose Parra, a Democratic strategist who worked as an adviser to former U.S. Sen. Harry Reid. \u201cThere is a future as a Democrat in Texas.\u201d\n\nPerhaps more importantly, O\u2019Rourke gave beleaguered Texas Democrats a new template by casting aside the traditional strategy of focusing turnout efforts on voters in the state\u2019s four largest urban areas, which skew blue. Instead, O\u2019Rourke anchored his aggressive ground game on his commitment to visit each of the state\u2019s 254 counties. As he traveled he focused on mobilizing Hispanic voters across the neglected border region while simultaneously pleading his case to independents and conservatives in red counties that in the past voted overwhelmingly for Republicans, including Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential race.\n\n\u201cFor the longest time, Texas has been written off as a lost cause,\u201d Veronica Escobar, a Democrat who was elected to take over O\u2019Rourke\u2019s House seat on Tuesday, told HuffPost. \u201cThere are huge groups of people who have felt left out of the process. Unless you talk to them, they\u2019re never coming back. And I mean literally talk to them. That\u2019s what Beto has done.\u201d\n\nThe 47-year-old Cruz, meanwhile, avoided what would have been a crushing blow for a politician who had rocketed to the national stage and now remains primed to be a leading figure in the GOP.\n\nAfter winning his Senate seat in 2012, Cruz quickly emerged as a strong \u2015 often strident \u2015 voice of the Tea Party conservatism that was remaking the GOP and pushing it further to the right. In 2013 alone, he helped scuttle a bipartisan push for the comprehensive reform of immigration policy reform and played a key role in a 16-day government shutdown.\n\nNever shy about his ambition, he quickly became a major contender in the crowded race for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination. He won several caucuses and primaries and emerged as the last candidate standing against Trump.\n\nThere appeared to be no love lost between the two men as they battled in the GOP race \u2015 the Texan called Trump a \u201cpathological liar,\u201d while the New York businessman took to calling his foe \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted Cruz.\u201d But after Trump won the White House, Cruz emerged as a reliable administration supporter and a defender of the president\u2019s combative style.\n\nTrump returned the favor by heartily endorsing Cruz and traveling to Texas late last month to headline a huge rally for the senator and, in typical fashion, bash O\u2019Rourke.\n\nThe Democrat, for his part, eschewed a political climate marked by negativity and ran a relentlessly upbeat campaign. O\u2019Rourke declined to attack Cruz until their second debate in October. Instead, he trumpeted bipartisanship while staking out positions on several issues that placed him within the Democratic Party\u2019s progressive wing.\n\nHe backed an incremental approach toward universal health care, tougher antitrust laws and a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. As part of a comprehensive critique urging reform of the criminal justice system, he called for the legalization of marijuana and the erasure of weed possession convictions.\n\nDemocrats have to get up the morning after this election, no matter how depressed they are, and really understand that one of the things that really helped them this cycle is that they attracted a really strong candidate at the top of the ticket and some really strong candidates at the congressional level, and think about immediately building on that. James Henson, political scientist at the University of Texas at Austin.\n\nThe highly publicized and covered contest between Cruz and O\u2019Rourke had at least one dramatic effect \u2015 spurring a significant expansion in the number of Texans on the voting rolls. In recent years, the state had added an average of 100,000 new voters to the rolls. But between the \u201916 presidential election and the close of registration this year, about 700,000 Texans registered to cast ballots.\n\nAlong with motivating new voters, the O\u2019Rourke campaign amassed an army of volunteers to carry out pop up block walks and staff a turnout operation that included more than 700 field offices. In a state where Democrats have struggled to build infrastructure to boost lagging turnout, particularly among Hispanics, that trend leaves some operatives feeling optimistic about the future.\n\n\u201cThis is a long-term game,\u201d said Oscar Silva, director of the political action committee Battleground Texas, which aims to flip the state to blue by raising turnout. \u201cIt\u2019s so exciting that it\u2019s happening faster than any of us imagined.\u201d\n\nAnd even in defeat, O\u2019Rourke walks away a rising star in his party who already has been mentioned as a potential presidential contender.\n\nBut none of the strides for Texas Democrats made possible by O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign changes the reality that the state remains under firm conservative control.\n\n\u201cDemocrats have to get up the morning after this election, no matter how depressed they are, and really understand that one of the things that really helped them this cycle is that they attracted a really strong candidate at the top of the ticket and some really strong candidates at the congressional level, and think about immediately building on that,\u201d said Henson, the University of Texas political scientist. \u201c2020 is going to be here before you know it.\u201d\n\nEven in defeat, O\u2019Rourke walks away a rising star in his party who already has been mentioned as a potential presidential contender. He ended the race sounding the themes that catapulted him to national prominence. Ignoring the crowd\u2019s booing, he said he\u2019d called Cruz to congratulate him and to offer his support, pledging to work with \u201canyone, any time, anywhere.\u201d\n\nHis supporters cheered him when he recalled that his unlikely run was made possible \u201cwithout a dime\u201d of corporate PAC money.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so fucking proud of you guys,\u201d he said to uproarious applause, dropping an f-bomb that escaped cable TV censors. \u201cThis campaign holds a very special place in history every day going forward. And you have made that possible.\u201d", "Republican Rep. Kevin Cramer defeated incumbent Democrat Heidi Heitkamp in the race for North Dakota\u2019s Senate seat on Tuesday.\n\nOver the last several months of this year\u2019s campaign, Heitkamp came to be viewed as her party\u2019s most endangered Senate member. Following her upset win in 2012, she was seeking a second term in a state Donald Trump won overwhelmingly in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nDespite selling herself as an agriculture-friendly, gun-supporting moderate who was willing to work with Trump, Heitkamp struggled to win over his supporters, especially in the wake of her surprise vote against Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination to the Supreme Court\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not 100 percent with anyone other than North Dakota,\u201d Heitkamp said in a debate with Cramer last month, portraying herself as an independent-minded Democrat.\n\nPolls consistently showed Cramer leading the race.\n\nThe 57-year-old Republican initially won his House seat \u2015 the state\u2019s only one \u2015 since 2012. He surprised many political observers early this year by announcing that rather than run for the Senate, he would seek another House term. But Trump ultimately persuaded him to take on Heitkamp, an intervention by the president that Cramer stressed on the campaign trail.\n\nHe lambasted Heitkamp, 63, for opposing key parts of Trump\u2019s agenda, including last year\u2019s massive tax cut bill.\n\nHeitkamp sided with the president, however, on some of his more controversial nominations, including his picks of Gina Haspel to head the CIA and Mike Pompeo to serve as secretary of state.\n\nIn her campaign, Heitkamp spotlighted Cramer\u2019s votes for repealing the Affordable Care Act and its insurance protections for people with preexisting medical conditions. She also criticized him for supporting Trump\u2019s trade policy and his tariffs on countries like China. The consequences of that trade dispute are particularly acute in North Dakota, where soybean farmers are struggling to store mountains of the unsold crop that in the past would be bound for hungry markets in China.\n\n\u201cThis president plays hardball, no doubt about it,\u201d Cramer said of Trump\u2019s trade policy during the debate with Heitkamp. He insisted that Trump was pursuing a long-term strategy that would pay off, and that the administration would take care of struggling farmers.\n\nThe fall\u2019s controversy over Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation and Heitkamp\u2019s decision to oppose him may have ultimately signed her political death warrant \u2015 something she seemed to recognize. During an interview after her vote, Heitkamp talked about needing to follow her conscience, regardless of the political repercussions, in the wake of the sexual abuse allegations that surfaced against Kavanaugh. Last year, she had revealed her own experience with sexual harassment.\n\n\u201cIf this were a political decision for me I certainly would be deciding this the other way. There\u2019s an old saying, \u2018History will judge you, but most importantly you\u2019ll judge yourself,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t get up in the morning and look at the life experience that I\u2019ve had and say yes\u201d to Kavanaugh.", "Texas is 40 percent Hispanic but has never sent a Latina to Congress \u2015 until now.\n\nDemocrats Veronica Escobar and Sylvia Garcia won their House seats Tuesday night, becoming the first Hispanic women the state has ever elected to federal office.\n\nRefinery29 Veronica Escobar will be one of the first Latina congresswomen from Texas.\n\nEscobar, a former El Paso County judge, won the seat vacated by Democratic Senate candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke in the 16th District. She gives the border district a Latina voice in Congress at a time of ferocious anti-immigration hysteria.\n\nPresident Donald Trump \u201creally frightens me and in a way that I haven\u2019t been frightened before,\u201d Escobar, a Bernie Sanders-style progressive, told HuffPost a year ago. \u201cI worry about the planet. I worry about immigrants. I worry about women. I worry about the LGBT community. I worry about El Paso and the border. And I feel this very intense sense of dread.\u201d\n\nOmar Vega via Getty Images Sylvia Garcia won Texas' 29th District.\n\nGarcia, previously a Texas state senator, won in Texas\u2019 29th District, a majority-Hispanic district in Eastern Houston. She previously ran for Congress in 1992 but lost to Rep. Gene Green (D), who has held the seat ever since but did not run for re-election this year.\n\n\u201cI wanted Latino girls and boys to know this is a state of opportunity and it\u2019s a welcoming state,\u201d Garcia said in March. \u201cYou have to work hard and believe in yourself and you can do it.\u201d\n\nBoth candidates support abortion rights, were endorsed by the powerhouse Democratic women\u2019s PAC EMILY\u2019s List, and have cited Trump\u2019s policies as motivation for running. But they differ on immigration rights. Garcia favors abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement, while Escobar wants to hold the agency more accountable for its actions.\n\nFor both women, the potential to make history was not their motivation for running, but they recognize the importance of the milestone.", "Democratic state Sen. Laura Kelly has won the Kansas governor\u2019s race, defeating Kansas secretary of state and Donald Trump ally Kris Kobach.\n\nKansans chose to elect a Democratic governor just two years after supporting Trump by over 20 percentage points. Polls showed a tied race heading into Election Day, but Kelly ended up with a fundraising edge over Kobach, a controversial figure with a national profile.\n\nWhile Kansas is frequently thought of as a deep-red state, former Gov. Sam Brownback (R) left office this year as one of the least popular governors in the country. He resigned to take a job in the Trump administration. Polls also showed that a large number of voters in the state had a negative view of Kobach, who had risen to prominence as a conservative hard-liner on voting restrictions and immigration.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nDespite Kobach\u2019s rising star in the GOP, two Republican former governors and a former U.S. senator for Kansas endorsed Kelly. Among his more controversial proposals, Kobach had vowed to reimplement Brownback\u2019s steep tax cuts, which were so disastrous for the state\u2019s economy that Republicans repealed them. Kelly\u2019s campaign consistently sought to tie Kobach to Brownback.\n\nKelly\u2019s win is also a defeat for Trump, who is close with Kobach and who traveled to the state to campaign for him. Vice President Mike Pence also stumped for Kobach.\n\nKelly, a state senator since 2005, faced criticism during the Democratic primary for being too cozy with the National Rifle Association and supporting a bill that allowed people to carry a concealed weapon without a permit. Kelly said she realized the bill went too far and supports restrictions on carrying weapons on college campuses.\n\nShe has also said she wouldn\u2019t back new abortion restrictions and was endorsed by Planned Parenthood and EMILY\u2019s List. Kelly has supported increased funding for education after the Kansas Supreme Court ruled the state had to increase school funding.\n\nShe also proved to be a strong fundraiser in the campaign, while Kobach relied on funds from his running mate, Republican lieutenant governor nominee Wink Hartman. Raising so much money allowed her to present herself as a credible alternative to Kobach, Bob Beatty, a political science professor at Washburn University in Topeka, told HuffPost last week.", "Mitt Romney completed one of the most circuitous comebacks in political history on Tuesday, with voters in Utah electing the one-time Massachusetts governor and 2012 Republican presidential nominee to be the state\u2019s next senator.\n\nThe Michigan-born-and-raised Romney handily defeated Democratic nominee Jenny Wilson, an at-large member of the Salt Lake City City Council.\n\nRomney\u2019s election in heavily Republican Utah was never really in question. In addition to Utah\u2019s heavy GOP registration bent, Romney, a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, has long been a popular figure in the state, which sports the country\u2019s largest Mormon population.\n\nHe replaces fellow Republican Orrin Hatch, the longest-serving GOP senator in history who is retiring after 42 years in office.\n\nAmong the crop of freshman lawmakers when Congress convenes in early 2019, the 71-year-old Romney can expect particular attention \u2015 and not just because of his already-established national profile. Romney\u2019s past criticism of President Donald Trump means one of the more fraught relationships in Republican politics will once again be in the spotlight.\n\nAs the 2016 battle for the GOP presidential nomination was in full swing, Romney delivered a stinging rebuke of Trump, calling him \u201ca phony\u201d and \u201ca fraud\u201d for whom dishonesty was \u201ca hallmark.\u201d He urged Republicans to choose another candidate; Trump responded by belittling Romney\u2019s 2012 presidential bid. In one speech he said Romney \u201cchoke like a dog.\u201d\n\nThe two later backed off their insult-trading, and Romney was on the president-elect\u2019s shortlist for secretary of state. But Romney also has maintained his distance from the divisive commander-in-chief.\n\nReports indicate that while Romney will likely not resort to harsh language if he feels compelled to upbraid Trump upon taking office, he may be inclined to speak out against the president on trade and national security issues.\n\nTwo of Trump\u2019s most vocal Senate Republican critics are retiring after this congressional session ends \u2015 Bob Corker of Tennessee and Jeff Flake of Arizona \u2015 and Romney could partially fill the void they leave.", "Carol Miller, a country-club Republican, beat a pro-coal populist Democrat who demanded tax hikes on the gas industry, in an election victory Tuesday that cements the GOP\u2019s grip on West Virginia\u2019s 3rd Congressional District and dashes Democrats\u2019 hope of regaining ground in a former stronghold.\n\nThe Republican, who recent polls favored to win, successfully painted Richard Ojeda, an Army veteran and state senator, as an out-of-touch stooge bent on undermining President Donald Trump.\n\nMiller\u2019s victory comes as a stinging loss for progressives who hoped the lavish national media coverage of Ojeda\u2019s campaign and working-class bona fides might upset a Republican who refused to even debate her opponent. Incumbent Sen. Joe Manchin, a conservative Democrat, cruised to an early victory on Tuesday night.\n\nMiller may have received a boost in recent weeks from White House efforts to drum up paranoia over immigration as a caravan of a few thousand migrants trudged northward through Mexico to request asylum in the United States. But Ojeda\u2019s fierce criticism of fossil fuel titans made him enemies that, in a state he defiantly called a resource \u201ccolony\u201d for wealthy interests, proved too powerful to overcome.\n\nMiller\u2019s victory solidifies Republican gains in a state once considered the bluest in the nation. Miller\u2019s district, which wraps like a U along the state\u2019s western and southern edges, went to Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, by 32 points. In 2014, Republican Evan Jenkins routed Democrat Nick Rahall, a 38-year incumbent, from the U.S. congressional seat by nearly 11 points, a victory he solidified two years later, winning re-election by 44 points. Trump\u2019s almost 50-point win painted the district ruby-red.\n\nA Census Bureau report last year estimated that 19.1 percent of West Virginia lived below the poverty line, making the state one of just four in the nation where that figure exceeds 18 percent. In the 3rd Congressional District, the poverty figure jumped to 23.3 percent, with another 12.5 percent of residents living between 100 percent and 150 percent of the poverty line.\n\nMICHAEL MATHES via Getty Images Richard Ojeda waged a fierce campaign as a populist, pro-coal Democrat fighting for the working class.\n\nYet, even as Republicans in Washington slash taxes on the ultra-wealthy, gut union protections and bolster corporate power, Trump\u2019s popularity and Miller\u2019s focus on national issues like abortion prohibitions proved enough to beat back Ojeda, who rejected corporate political action committee donations and championed wage hikes for teachers and prison guards.\n\nOjeda proposed paying for new infrastructure and higher pay for workers with a 2.5 percent increase in the natural gas drillers\u2019 severance tax and a 15 percent hike on gas shipped out of the state. The industry responded by pouring money into Miller\u2019s campaign. Steptoe & Johnston, a top corporate law firm in Washington for pipeline companies, became Miller\u2019s top donor, giving at least $23,500 this year, according to data from the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. Jenkins & Fenstermaker, a West Virginia-based law firm with a large gas practice, ranked fifth behind a series of car dealerships.\n\nDubbed \u201cthe New Power Brokers\u201d by ProPublica as it supplants the once-hegemonic coal business, the gas industry has steadily notched legal and political victories in the state over the past few years.

The confusion was a result of an October court ruling that allowed Missourians to cast ballots with multiple forms of identification.\n\nTaylor Fritz, 25, brought the voter registration card mailed to him by the state to cast a ballot at his polling station, the Legacy Park Community Center in Lees Summit. But poll workers there told him the card was not an acceptable form of ID, even though a state website specifically says it is. There was even a poster in the gymnasium where he cast a ballot that stated registration cards were acceptable, Fritz said.\n\n\u201cLucky for me I was able to show my valid state-issued ID,\u201d Fritz, an insurance broker, said in an interview. \u201cThe problem is not everyone has a state ID like me.\u201d\n\nKristen Mitchell, a retired 51-year-old, had a similar experience when she went to vote in Dallas County, in southwest Missouri. She said she saw signs at the polls telling people that photo ID was required to vote. Poll workers told voters they had to have photo ID to cast ballots, she said, and refused to take down the erroneous signs.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nMissouri\u2019s voter ID law, which went into effect in 2017, required voters to show a photo ID at the polls. But if a voter didn\u2019t have an acceptable form of photo ID, they could verify their identity using other documents, such as a bank statement or utility bill. Under the 2017 law, if voters used one of those other forms of verification, they had to sign an affidavit swearing they \u201cdidn\u2019t have a form of identification approved for voting.\u201d In October, Cole County Judge Richard Callahan struck down the affidavit requirement, saying it was confusing. Missouri Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft appealed the ruling, but the Missouri Supreme Court declined to overturn it.\n\nCallahan\u2019s ruling meant that Missourians did not legally have to show photo ID at the polls on Tuesday and did not have to sign any additional documents swearing they were unable to obtain an acceptable form of ID.\n\nMany poll workers were not clear about the new rules.\n\nDallas County Clerk Stephanie Hendricks said she was unaware of problems at her polling place.\n\nHendricks said the small county had to \u201cscrape the bottom of the barrel\u201d for poll workers, who received only 90 minutes of training. This, combined with the very short notice for the legal change, made it difficult to ensure that poll workers understood the law.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s only so much you can get people to absorb in an hour or an hour and a half. We do the best we can, but I can\u2019t say it always soaks in,\u201d Hendricks said. \u201cThe last few elections it\u2019s been photo ID, photo ID, photo ID, and now all of a sudden the brakes have been thrown on. It\u2019s confusing for people.\u201d\n\nBritt Eubanks, 53, decided to use his U.S. passport to vote in St. Charles because he has had issues voting with his driver\u2019s license in the past. When he presented his passport, Eubanks said a poll worker told him he needed his driver\u2019s license. When Eubanks replied that a passport was acceptable, he said the poll workers told him it would take longer to vote because they would have to enter that ID manually. It ultimately took them a few minutes to enter his information, he said.\n\n\u201cI would like to think it was just lack of training,\u201d Eubanks said in an interview.\n\nSt. Charles County appears to be instructing its poll workers to disregard Judge Callahan\u2019s ruling and has so far ignored demand letters from lawyers at Advancement Project, a civil rights group. Advancement Project attorney Denise Lieberman said the group is considering legal remedies due to the county\u2019s \u201cflagrant disregard\u201d for the judge\u2019s ruling.\n\nLieberman said dozens of voters have called Advancement Project with complaints about poll workers, who are reportedly telling voters who present non-photo forms of ID that they \u201cdon\u2019t agree\u201d with the ruling and don\u2019t believe they are required to follow it. Lieberman said the group first sent a demand letter to Rich Chrismer, the local director of elections in St. Charles County, on Tuesday afternoon. He did not respond, and follow-up calls to his office were not returned. A letter to the county\u2019s attorney did not receive a response.\n\nCalls to St. Charles County were not returned. Each time reporters called the county, hold time estimates were greater than one hour.\n\nAdvancement Project also sent Franklin County a demand letter after voters at two polling locations there reported poll workers were refusing to accept non-photo ID. Debbe Door, the Franklin County clerk, said she was surprised to get the letter but immediately called both locations to review the new rules. She said that the late notice made it difficult to impress the rules upon poll workers and that the county was doing \u201cthe best we can\u201d to make sure everyone could vote.\n\n\u201cWe did everything we could given that we were on such short notice,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got election judges that are 70 or 80 years old and we threw something new at them without an opportunity to train.\u201d\n\nVoters who called the national Election Protection hotline also reported that poll workers demanded driver\u2019s licenses and rejected other forms of ID allowed under the ruling, and that they pushed back when voters explained that was no longer allowed. Lieberman said her group is seeing the same across St. Charles County.\n\nMaura Browning, a spokeswoman for the Missouri secretary of state, said the state\u2019s top election official has not received many complaints over the issue.\n\n\u201cWe have had very few reports of problems,\u201d she said in an email. \u201cThere may have been some confusion in a few of the 3,000 polling places in Missouri, but Judge Callahan\u2019s ruling just 13 days before the election opened up the opportunity for that. Aside from those minor hiccups, the day has gone very smoothly.\u201d\n\nMarc Elias, an attorney with Priorities USA, the group that brought the suit challenging the Missouri law, said that if workers were indeed requiring people to show photo ID or sign an affidavit, they would be violating a court order.\n\nTrey Grayson, who served as Kentucky\u2019s secretary of state from 2004 to 2011, said it wasn\u2019t uncommon to see poll workers confused about voter ID requirements, particularly when there had been a court-ordered change so close to an election.\n\n\u201cI think one of the challenges is that voter ID laws vary state by state,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re always in the news. It\u2019s easy for even well-meaning poll workers to kind of get confused.\u201d", "Debbie Mucarsel-Powell ousted Rep.

Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.) lost his bid for a third term.\n\nIn July, Curbelo proposed a $24 per metric ton carbon tax, legislation that made waves not for its ambition but for its break with party that, as a platform issue, rejects the mainstream scientific consensus that humans are causing climate change and there\u2019s still time to halt emissions.\n\nThe bill faced meager prospects of becoming law. Days after Curbelo unveiled the bill, 97 percent of House Republicans voted to approve a resolution stating that a carbon tax would be harmful to the U.S. economy. The National Review called it \u201cwealth redistribution.\u201d The Natural Resources Defense Council, the powerful environmental group, called the legislation a \u201cnotable breakthrough\u201d but refused to endorse it.\n\nYet the legislation bolstered a push among some Republicans to abandon the widely debunked climate change denialism that has pervaded the party for decades but came a mainstream stance after the 2008 election.\n\nFor Curbelo and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Republican congresswoman from a neighboring South Florida district, climate change was too obvious to doubt. Their districts suffer routine flooding from sea level rise, both as storm surge and through the porous limestone bedrock beneath much of the Sunshine State\u2019s southern tip. With Ros-Lehtinen retiring, Democrat Donna Shalala, the former health and human services secretary under President Bill Clinton, defeated Republican Maria Elvira Salazar to take her seat Tuesday night.\n\nIt\u2019ll likely spell the end of the climate peacocks.

Toss in reputed Mexican drug kingpin Joaquin \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzman Loera, accused of being the head of the world\u2019s most powerful drug trafficking organization, and the dreary affair is laden with a host of concerns.\n\nThat\u2019s what federal prosecutors in New York have discovered this week as U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan, who is overseeing Guzman\u2019s trial inside a highly secure federal courthouse in Brooklyn, dismissed more than two dozen potential jurors in the first two days of jury selection.\n\nTen potential jurors were excused from the case on Tuesday and 17 were dismissed Monday, with several reportedly indicating they feared the consequences of any verdict.\n\nEduardo Munoz/Reuters Attorneys for Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman arrive Monday at the federal courthouse in Brooklyn, New York.\n\nOne of the people dismissed Tuesday said she had read a news report that said Guzman had promised not to kill jurors, which she said made her \u201cpretty anxious,\u201d according to Reuters. A man was let go after he expressed having \u201csome emotions mixed with fear.\u201d\n\nAnother woman told the judge she would have to \u201cmove and get a new house.\u201d Her remarks caused Guzman to laugh. A man was also reportedly dismissed after saying he was \u201ca bit of a fan\u201d and asked for Guzman\u2019s autograph.\n\nSimilar dismissals occurred on the first day of jury selection when 45 of about 100 potential jurors were interviewed by Cogan.\n\n\u201cWhat scares me is that his family could come after jurors and their family,\u201d one woman said in court Monday before she was dismissed by the judge, CBS News reported.\n\nAnother potential juror was sent home after telling the judge she was \u201cnervous\u201d about being on the jury.\n\nAssociated Press Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman is escorted from a plane to a waiting caravan of SUVs in New York's Long Island on Jan. 19, 2017.\n\nFederal prosecutors have alleged that Guzman, 61, led the Sinaloa cartel and trafficked an estimated $14 billion in drugs into the U.S. He was arrested and extradited in January 2017, following two elaborate escapes from Mexican prisons.\n\nHe\u2019s facing a 17-count indictment accusing him of multiple crimes, including drug trafficking, money laundering and murder. The accused cartel chief has pleaded not guilty to the charges. If convicted, he faces a mandatory minimum sentence of life in prison.\n\nThe judge has ordered the panel, once assembled, to be partially sequestered and escorted to and from the courthouse by U.S. marshals during the trial, which is expected to last four months.\n\nThe potential jurors\u2019 names are also being kept secret, according to CBS News legal analyst Rikki Klieman, in an effort to shield them from potential bribes and hit men.\n\n\u201cThese jurors are going to be protected in a way that is highly unusual,\u201d Klieman said. \u201cNo one will know their names. They won\u2019t know their addresses, their occupations. This will not become information for the public or certainly not for the Sinaloa drug cartel.\u201d\n\nAgence France-Presse A member of the U.S. Marshals Service patrols outside the courthouse where jury selection for Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman's trial is taking place.\n\nHowever, given that Guzman still allegedly maintains ties to the cartel from behind bars and has an estimated net worth of $1 billion, he\u2019s not an average defendant. And if history should serve as an example, prospective jurors might very well have cause for concern.\n\nPrior to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the biggest terrorism-related court case of 2001 was the prosecution of four men accused of being al Qaeda terrorists who worked with Osama bin Laden to bomb two U.S. embassies, killing 224 people.\n\nIn an effort to protect jurors from the potential of reprisals, the Manhattan federal court ordered that their identities be withheld from everyone, including the presiding judge and attorneys. Despite this proactive approach to protect the panelists, a New York Times reporter still managed to identify 11 of the jurors and conducted post-verdict interviews with nine of them. Those interviews were featured in the Jan. 5, 2003, story \u201cA Jury Torn and Fearful in 2001 Terrorism Trial.\u201d\n\nAn anonymous jury was also impaneled in New York nearly a decade earlier, during mobster John Gotti\u2019s 1992 criminal trial. In that case, a juror allegedly accepted a bribe from Gotti\u2019s associates to arrange for his acquittal.\n\nInternational Business Times Then Gambino crime family boss John Gotti in New York City on Jan, 20, 1987.\n\nAlthough courts can take steps to protect a juror\u2019s identity, it is not an infallible system, especially today with the advancements in technology and social media.\n\nAside from whether jurors can truly remain anonymous, withholding their names raises questions about a defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial. In February, Guzman\u2019s attorney Eduardo Balarezo failed to convince a judge that withholding jurors\u2019 names would send the message that his client is dangerous and therefore deny him an impartial trial jury, as guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment.\n\n\u201cAll he is asking for is a fair trial in front of an impartial jury,\u201d Balarezo said in a statement emailed to NPR after the proceeding.\n\nBalarezo did not respond to a request for comment from HuffPost.\n\nYahoo Magazines PYC The trial of Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman is under tight security, authorities said.\n\nIf Guzman is convicted, perceived violations of his rights will likely take center stage on appeal, along with his mental state, given that he\u2019s been kept in solitary confinement since his arrest. The attorneys will also likely cite the fact that the majority of the witnesses expected to testify might not be the most credible, considering many have been jailed or are connected to various crimes, which likely prompted them to make deals with prosecutors.\n\nJury selection continues Wednesday and will last until 12 principal jurors and six alternates are seated. A timeline for that is not yet known, but officials have said opening statements are expected to begin on Nov. 13.\n\nWhile a conviction of Guzman might result in a few pats on the back among federal authorities and various politicians, what\u2019s not being widely reported is that a successful prosecution of Guzman is not going to break the backs of Mexican cartels. Practically all of them, including the Sinaloa cartel, have leaders behind bars and yet remain in business.\n\nThe toppling of one king simply results in the crowning of another.", "THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Sen.

The 1.4 million people in the state who have been disenfranchised by that policy represent an estimated 10 percent of Florida\u2019s voting population and a quarter of the total disenfranchised population in the United States. More than 1 in 5 African-Americans in the state are disenfranchised because of the policy, according to an estimate from The Sentencing Project.

Blocking felons from voting while also passing criminal codes that targeted black people was a strategy to keep African-Americans from the ballot box.\n\nThe state\u2019s constitution allowed the governor to restore voting rights for any reason he or she saw fit and didn\u2019t require an explanation. When Republican Gov. Rick Scott took office in 2011, he changed the rules of the process and required people to wait five to seven years before they could begin to apply. Scott and other top officials met only four times a year to consider applications to restore voting rights, causing a backlog of more than 10,000 requests. Several people who appeared before the board this year said they had begun the process to get their voting rights restored over a decade ago.\n\nNeil Volz, political director of the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition, the group behind the measure, said he and Desmond Meade, the group\u2019s chair, were watching the returns in a hotel room in Orlando together and broke into tears when it was announced the amendment passed.\n\n\u201cThis is just a vote of love, man. To see so many people in a room crying, hugging each other and really just celebrating years worth of hard work. I\u2019m feeling a new chapter is beginning,\u201d he said in an interview.\n\nVirginia, Iowa and Kentucky remain the only states with permanent disenfranchisement policies on the books. In Virginia, however, Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam has continued a policy begun under his predecessor of personally aggressively restoring voting rights to people with felony convictions.", "Republican Rep. Marsha Blackburn won Tennessee\u2019s open U.S. Senate seat Tuesday after a campaign yoked to President Donald Trump.\n\nBlackburn, a Trump loyalist and eight-term congresswoman who espoused deeply conservative values, beat former Gov. Phil Bredesen (D), who campaigned as a moderate who would work with Trump on some issues.\n\nShe portrayed herself as a Republican firebrand, saying she carried a gun in her purse and unwaveringly supported Trump\u2019s plan to build a wall along the southern border.\n\n\u201cI get up every day and I go fight for five things: Faith, family, freedom, hope and opportunity,\u201d Blackburn said at a debate with Bredesen. \u201cTonight, what you saw was one who\u2019s going to be a fighter for those things and individual freedoms, and one that is going to support bigger government and big-government solutions.\u201d\n\nTrump, who carried the state by 26 percentage points in his 2016 election, ventured to Tennessee last month to campaign for Blackburn, telling supporters that \u201ca vote for Marsha is really a vote for me and everything that we stand for.\u201d\n\nBlackburn will fill the seat vacated by Republican Bob Corker, who said earlier this year he would retire after two terms.", "Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) won re-election on Tuesday, a victory for Democrats in a state that President Donald Trump won in 2016.\n\nBaldwin defeated Republican state Sen. Leah Vukmir in the midterm elections for a second term in the Senate.\n\nFrom early on, the Wisconsin Senate race was a top prize for the GOP. Conservative groups poured more money into that race to boost Republicans than into any other this cycle.\n\nWisconsin went for Trump in 2016, after voting for Barack Obama in the previous two cycles. Also that cycle, Sen. Ron Johnson (R) defeated Russ Feingold, a surprise victory in a race where the Democratic former senator was widely expected to win back his seat.\n\nBut Baldwin benefited from the massive Democratic momentum nationwide, and she appealed to rural areas that she won in 2012 \u2015 even though they had gone for Trump in the presidential election.\n\nBaldwin, unlike other Democratic senators running in redder states, ran as an unabashed progressive. But in Wisconsin, supporters more often stressed her responsiveness to their concerns and her willingness to work across the aisle \u2015 often on issues that weren\u2019t obviously partisan, such as \u201cBuy America\u201d legislation and dairy farming.\n\nVukmir, a conservative state senator, won a tough primary against a well-funded opponent, veteran Kevin Nicholson. She is known in southeastern Wisconsin, which she represented in the legislature, but less so in the rest of the state, and she consistently trailed Baldwin in the polls during the campaign.\n\nRepublicans tried to go after Baldwin on the issue of veterans and the opioid crisis, saying she didn\u2019t act aggressively enough to address the overprescription of opioids at a Veterans Affairs facility in the state. But Baldwin emphasized legislation she passed on the issue, and she received the support of the family members of a Marine who died at the medical center.\n\nBaldwin also opened up about her own mother\u2019s addiction to prescription drugs and released a personal ad talking about it.\n\nVukmir also ran on immigration, characterizing Baldwin as being \u201cpart of an angry liberal mob\u201d that was stopping Trump from building his wall on the border with Mexico, and she supported repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act.", "But as in other states, much of the Indiana Senate debate focused on health care. Donnelly has opposed Republican efforts to repeal or undermine parts of the Affordable Care Act. Even though he supported those efforts, Braun claimed that he, rather than Donnelly, would better protect people with pre-existing conditions from discrimination by insurance companies. He based his claim in the fact that his firm provides health insurance for its employees, even though they have to pay an unusually high deductible before their coverage kicks in.", "1 / 7 Pennsylvania\n\nYou're an average voter in Pennsylvania. The night before Election Day, your wallet goes missing, leaving you without immediate access to any of the identification you'll need to vote at your local precinct the following morning. While many people in this situation may have backup forms of identification, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/05/pennsylvania-voter-id-law_n_1652469.html\" target=\"_hplink\">studies have shown</a> that a significant percentage of would-be voters don't. The state's safeguard against the immediate disenfranchisement of people in this situation is a provisional ballot cast on the day of the election. But this doesn't mean your vote counts, yet. According to <a href=\"http://www.ncsl.org/legislatures-elections/elections/voter-id.aspx#PA\" target=\"_hplink\">Pennsylvania's new photo ID law</a>, anyone who casts a provisional ballot is required to \"appear in person at the county board of elections\" within six days of the vote to provide proof that their ballot was valid. If you're able to take time away from your job to do this, the process still requires a would-be voter to either show up with valid ID -- a replacement driver's license <a href=\"http://www.dmv.state.pa.us/fees/index.shtml\" target=\"_hplink\">would cost $36</a> and considerable time -- or to sign an affirmation that you are indigent and not able to afford the fees associated with acquiring a photo ID. Even if you make a rapid and somewhat expensive turnaround to get a replacement ID -- or alternatively swear under oath that you are too poor to pay for such a document -- there is no guarantee that your vote will end up counting. Many elections are largely decided before provisional voters have a chance to verify their validity, which could serve to discouraging them from following up with election officials or leave them effectively disenfranchised. In 2008, <a href=\"http://www.eac.gov/assets/1/Documents/2008 Election Administration and Voting Survey EAVS Report.pdf\" target=\"_hplink\">only 61.8 percent</a> of all provisional ballots cast were fully counted. With the recent implementation of these strict photo ID measures, however, the number of provisional ballots submitted will likely increase, as will the requirements for voters hoping to make them count. <em>(Photo: AP)</em>", "Reuters President Donald Trump campaigned with Rep.

Amy McGrath on Tuesday, giving the GOP an early election night victory over a prominent Democratic upstart in Kentucky\u2019s 6th Congressional district.\n\n\n\nBarr won roughly 51 percent of votes as a surge of support from the district\u2019s rural counties carried him to re-election, according to The Associated Press.\n\nMcGrath, part of a long list of women and veterans running as Democrats, rose to national prominence early in the 2018 campaign cycle after an ad touting her background as the first female Marine to fly an F/A-18 in combat missions went viral.\n\nBarr\u2019s victory denied Democrats an early opportunity to flip a Republican-controlled seat, in a swing district that wasn\u2019t supposed to be one, in their bid to regain majority control of the House of Representatives.\n\nKentucky\u2019s 6th District was a safe GOP seat at the outset of the 2018 cycle, with forecasters projecting a smooth re-election campaign for Barr and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee leaving it off an initial list of targets.\n\nBut sinking approval for congressional Republicans and McGrath\u2019s surge in popularity during a Democratic primary, in which she upset Lexington Mayor Jim Gray, threw the race into question.\n\nReuters McGrath became one of Democrats' most prominent challengers in early 2018, and turned her race against Barr into a national bellwether after her upset win in the Democratic primary in May.\n\nMcGrath, who ran as an outsider inspired to enter politics after Donald Trump was elected in 2016, hammered Barr for voting to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which provided health care to thousands of district residents, and in favor of this year\u2019s GOP tax cut plan. She pushed herself as a representative who owed nothing to either party and would work to bring jobs and investment to the district in a way that would benefit ordinary Kentuckians instead of the \u201c1 percent.\u201d\n\nBarr, meanwhile, targeted McGrath\u2019s socially liberal stances in an effort to paint her as \u201ctoo liberal for Kentucky.\u201d He ran ads blasting McGrath for acknowledging that she was a feminist, and for supporting abortion rights and contraception access.\n\nThe race had become a priority on both sides by October, with Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden visiting the district on consecutive days to campaign for their parties\u2019 respective candidates.

In the primary, she secured an upset win against 10-term Democratic incumbent Rep. Michael Capuano.

He was indicted in 2015 on charges including bribery and fraud stemming from allegations that he engaged in a quid pro quo relationship with a friend \u2015 advancing the man\u2019s business interests and in return accepting an array of gifts, including luxury trips abroad.\n\nA judge declared a mistrial in the case last year because of a hung jury, and the Justice Department decided against retrying Menendez. In April, however, he was \u201cseverely admonished\u201d over the matter by the Senate ethics committee.\n\nThe allegations \u2015 which Menendez, 64, consistently denied \u2015 resulted in a surprisingly close Democratic primary race earlier this year, as well as a backhanded endorsement by The Star-Ledger editorial board just days before the election that urged voters to \u201cchoke it down\u201d and vote for the incumbent.\n\nThe editorial in the state\u2019s most prominent newspaper opined that the Senate race offered \u201cthe most depressing choice for New Jersey voters in a generation, with two awful candidates whose most convincing argument is that the other guy is unfit to serve.\u201d\n\nThe paper concluded that Menendez, first appointed to his seat in early 2006, was the better choice because he could be counted upon to stand up to President Donald Trump.\n\nHugin, 64, a wealthy former CEO of a biopharmaceutical company who poured millions of dollars into his own campaign, made the corruption charges that Menendez had fended off a huge part of his message. Late in the race, he also released a scathing ad that brought up old prostitution allegations against Menendez that were never substantiated.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lie, Bob. You know it\u2019s a lie,\u201d Menendez said to Hugin during a debate last month.\n\nHugin\u2019s record also gave Democrats ample opportunity to go on the attack. During his time as CEO of Celgene, for example, the company raised U.S. prices by 20 percent for its Revlimid cancer drug while cutting them by 45 percent in Russia.\n\nHis ties to Trump also became campaign fodder: he was a New Jersey delegate to the 2016 Republican National Convention, served as finance chair for Trump\u2019s campaign in the state and donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to pro-Trump groups.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a Trump Republican, I\u2019m an independent Republican,\u201d Hugin insisted at their October debate, calling for more moderate immigration policies than the president has advocated and backing efforts to combat climate change. The businessman also criticized Trump\u2019s tax cut for putting a cap on the state and local tax deduction, which has hurt many Garden State residents.\n\nGiven the money Hugin poured into his candidacy, Democratic outside groups were forced to spend millions in support of Menendez in the race\u2019s final weeks \u2015 precious resources that could have gone to battleground races elsewhere. Republicans gleefully mocked the Democratic groups for having to help bail out Menendez in what should have been an easy race.\n\nRepublican National Committee spokesman Michael Ahrens said that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) was \u201crobbing from battleground races to save his corrupt pal, decreasing the already minuscule chance they had to regain the Senate majority.\u201d", "Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican who has made a point of distancing himself from President Donald Trump, won a second term on Tuesday.\n\nHe beat Democrat Ben Jealous, the former president of the NAACP who is biracial.\n\nHogan has maintained strong approval ratings since he was first elected in 2014 in a state Democrat Hillary Clinton carried in the 2016 presidential race with 60 percent of the vote. Hogan, 62, did not endorse Trump and has said he did not vote for him.\n\nThe governor is widely seen as a pragmatic politician, one who at times has sided with Democrats on issues and has stressed the importance of working across party lines.\n\nThe 45-year-old Jealous, who backed Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in the battle for the \u201916 Democratic presidential nomination, ran on a progressive platform that included calls for free in-state college tuition and Medicare-for-all.\n\nHogan in October came under attack after his campaign posted a video on Twitter that mocked Jealous for misspeaking, including saying at times that he was running for president, not governor. Jealous has a speech impediment that sometimes causes him to stutter.\n\n\u201cI need to draw a line. He\u2019s gone beyond the pale and he needs to stop,\u201d Jealous said of the video. \u201cThese ads are bullying. While I can take it, it encourages the bullying of young people, and that\u2019s not OK.\u201d\n\nJust a few months into his first term, Hogan announced that he was suffering from cancer. He underwent chemotherapy, and in late 2016 said he was cancer free.\n\nHogan critics have voiced concern that he could become more conservative in his second term, The Washington Post reported. In 2015, he proposed cutting Medicaid costs by getting rid of free prenatal care for more than a thousand low-income pregnant women. He did not, however, follow through on that proposal.", "Chicago Tribune via Getty Images J.B. Pritzker campaigned with former president Barack Obama in the closing days of his successful gubernatorial campaign.\n\nDemocrat J.B. Pritzker has been elected the next governor of Illinois, defeating Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner in the most expensive gubernatorial race in United States history.\n\nThe outcome of this race had been all but assured for months. Rauner was the most unpopular governor running for re-election, having blocked state budgets, attacked labor unions and hired anti-labor economic advisers in a state largely dominated by a Democratic Party with strong union ties. He won his race in 2014 \u2015 a year with historically low voter turnout \u2015 over the equally unpopular Democrat Pat Quinn. It\u2019s no surprise he lost re-election amid a nation- and statewide surge in voter turnout.\n\nWhat did stand out about the race between Pritzker and Rauner was the cost.\n\nThe so-called \u201cBattle of the Billionaires\u201d was the most expensive gubernatorial race in the history of the United States. The cost of the entire election is set to top $284 million, which is $4 million more than the 2010 California governor\u2019s race. The general election alone will exceed $200 million, also higher than the cost of the 2010 California general election.\n\nBoth candidates are incredibly rich and were able to donate vast sums of their own money to their respective campaigns.\n\nPritzker, an heir to the Hyatt Hotel fortune, donated more than $145 million to his own campaign \u2015 a self-funding record total surpassing the $144 million Meg Whitman spent in the 2010 California race. Rauner contributed $50 million to his own campaign and also received $22.5 million from conservative billionaire Ken Griffin. Griffin, a Chicago-based hedge fund manager, is infamous for his 2012 assertion that the rich have an \u201cinsufficient influence\u201d over the nation\u2019s politics.\n\nIllinois has teetered between corrupt and unpopular governors for nearly 15 years. Former Gov. George Ryan (R) left office in 2003 under a cloud of scandal that ultimately led to his conviction for corruption in 2006. His successor, Rod Blagojevich (D), is still in prison for a pay-to-play scheme to sell the open Senate seat vacated by President Barack Obama in 2009. Quinn and Rauner wound up being two of the most unpopular governors in the nation during their terms in office.", "Georgia Republican gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp, the state elections chief who has faced accusations of voter suppression, ran into a voting snafu on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nWhile voting at his polling location, Kemp was initially turned away because his voter card was deemed \u201cinvalid.\u201d He voted after getting another card, according to Atlanta\u2019s WSB-TV, which followed the candidate throughout the day Tuesday.\n\nA spokeswoman for Kemp\u2019s office confirmed the issue, saying a poll worker may have incorrectly programmed the electronic card used to access the voting machine.

Barbara Comstock (R-Va.) in one of the easiest pick-up opportunities for Democrats in the 2018 midterm elections.\n\nComstock, who was seeking her third term in office, was essentially living on borrowed time after the 2016 election. Hillary Clinton won this suburban Northern Virginia district by 10 points in 2016, while Comstock won it by six points. Virginia\u2019s 10th Congressional District was one of five districts that voted for Clinton by 10 or more points and elected a Republican to Congress in 2016.\n\nDistrict voters may have split their tickets in 2016, but not this time around. The district voted heavily for Wexton and Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Clinton\u2019s vice presidential nominee in 2016 who this year ran against the wildly unpopular neo-Confederate Republican Corey Stewart.\n\nTrump and congressional Republicans did little to help Comstock with an aggressive campaign against federal government workers and constant threats to shut down the government. The district she represents is filled with government workers who commute to work in Washington, D.C., and other northern Virginia counties. She opposed the president\u2019s policies to freeze federal worker pay and cut retirement benefits, but her affiliation with the Republican Party makes her another vote to keep his party in control of the House.\n\nThe 10th District is also full of the college-educated white voters \u2015 specifically, college-educated white women \u2015 who have turned hard against Trump and the Republicans over a range of issues, including the president\u2019s outspoken racism and misogyny, as well as tax cuts that mostly benefited corporations and the extremely rich while doing little for even the relatively wealthy residents of suburban Virginia.\n\nComstock\u2019s reputation as a strong gun rights advocate had also made her a key target of the gun reform movement, with advocacy groups pouring nearly $1 million into the race, according to tracking by The Trace, an outlet funded by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg\u2019s Everytown for Gun Safety organization. The National Rifle Association meanwhile endorsed Comstock once again, having supported her in previous cycles. Although the NRA touted her \u201cA\u201d rating, it spent just over $12,000 in the election.", "Laura Ingraham, host of \u201cThe Ingraham Angle,\u201d followed in her Fox News colleagues\u2019 ill-fated footsteps on Tuesday afternoon when she openly endorsed two Republican candidates in close races.\n\nJust a couple of hours before, Fox News had issued a statement criticizing hosts Sean Hannity and Jeanine Pirro for hopping onstage with President Donald Trump at a Monday evening campaign rally. The network called the hosts' move an \u201cunfortunate distraction\u201d that \u201chas been addressed,\u201d but did not specify what action it had taken.\n\n\u201cFox News does not condone any talent participating in campaign events,\u201d the network said. \u201cWe have an extraordinary team of journalists helming our coverage tonight and we are extremely proud of their work.\u201d\n\nA handful of Fox News employees told CNN\u2019s Oliver Darcy that people throughout the network were upset, believing that \u201ca new line was crossed.\u201d\n\nObservers accused Hannity, Fox News\u2019 biggest star, of campaigning for the president as he ostensibly represented a network of journalists. Onstage, Trump praised the Fox host as one of the \u201cincredible people\u201d who had \u201cdone an incredible job for us\u201d while Hannity decried other journalists\u2019 work as \u201cfake news.\u201d\n\nThe president also called up Pirro, whose program Trump is also known to watch.\n\nAs criticism of Hannity and Pirro continued to build, Ingraham tweeted out a pair of endorsements: one for Connecticut gubernatorial hopeful Bob Stefanowski (R) and another for incumbent Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Texas).\n\nConnecticut, it's time to break free from high taxes, corrupt governance. Vote Bob Stefanowski for governor. @bobforgovernor https://t.co/iNjJFg1KKA \u2014 Laura Ingraham (@IngrahamAngle) November 6, 2018\n\n\u201cConnecticut, it\u2019s time to break free from high taxes, corrupt governance,\u201d Ingraham wrote. \u201cVote Bob Stefanowski for governor.\u201d\n\nTwo hours later, she wrote, \u201cEveryone in TX get out and vote for [Pete Sessions] who is one of the finest congressmen you could hope for! Do NOT stay home.\u201d\n\nStefanowski is up against Democratic candidate Ned Lamont, while Sessions is battling Democrat Colin Allred. Polls show both races to be a toss-up, although Allred showed a small lead on Monday.", "A poll worker in Houston was fired from her position and given a citation by police Tuesday after allegedly berating a black voter with a racist tirade.\n\n\u201cMaybe if I\u2019d worn my blackface makeup today you could comprehend what I\u2019m saying to you,\u201d Juanita Barnes, who is white, allegedly told Rolanda Anthony, who is black, the Houston Chronicle reported.\n\nAfter Anthony arrived to vote, a different poll worker told her that there was a problem regarding her address and that she needed to fill out a residency verification form, according to the paper. She asked why the form was necessary, since she said her address in the voter rolls should match the one on her ID and she has been voting in the same precinct for years.\n\nBarnes, an alternate election judge overseeing the polls, went up to Anthony and started shouting, telling her, \u201cIt\u2019s illegal for you not to change your address on your driver\u2019s license if you move,\u201d the Chronicle said.\n\nEdith Randle, the presiding election judge, said she confronted Barnes, the publication reported. \u201cYou can\u2019t say that,\u201d Randle said and repeatedly told Barnes to get out of Anthony\u2019s way.\n\n\u201cI stepped back, all the way against the wall,\u201d Anthony told the publication. \u201cJuanita comes all the way over there, putting her hands in my face, yelling and screaming at me, telling me she\u2019s the (alternate) election judge and I\u2019m going to do what she says.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was just floored,\u201d Anthony added. \u201cI was, like, what exactly is going on here?\u201d\n\nAfter Anthony said she would report the incident to the police, Barnes allegedly shoulder-bumped Anthony and told her, \u201cI\u2019m white. Have you seen the news?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you call the police, they\u2019re going to take you to jail and do something to you, because I\u2019m white,\u201d Barnes allegedly added.", "Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) cruised to re-election on Tuesday against Confederate flag-defending, far-right Republican Corey Stewart.\n\nKaine, his party\u2019s 2016 vice presidential candidate, ran on a progressive platform that embraced health care for all, tougher gun control laws and increasing access to education. In Stewart, he faced a challenger known for his anti-immigrant rhetoric and associations with white supremacist groups. But the incumbent mostly focused on his own record and positions.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m running a positive campaign \u2015 a Virginia that works for all,\u201d Kaine told Roanoke-based WDBJ-TV last week. \u201cWhen I talk to Virginians, they want people who will pull us together. I stay away from the name-calling stuff. That\u2019s just not what I do. I\u2019ve never done that in my time in elected office.\u201d\n\nThe former Virginia governor\u2019s reluctance to engage in hostile messaging was in stark contrast to Stewart, the controversial chairman of the Prince William Board of County Supervisors for more than a decade. In that post, he attracted national attention for pushing crackdowns on undocumented immigrants.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Stewart regularly echoed President Donald Trump\u2019s aggressive rhetoric toward the media and Democrats, accusing the political party of being an \u201cangry mob.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be the president\u2019s number-one partner in the Senate,\u201d Stewart told The Virginian-Pilot in October. \u201cI\u2019m willing to be the bruiser \u2015 twisting arms, knocking heads and ridiculing other senators in order to pressure them to getting the president\u2019s agenda through ... To do whatever it takes.\u201d\n\nStewart has been a vocal defender of Confederate monuments in Virginia and a strong supporter of a U.S.-Mexico border wall. He denies that global warming over the last century has rapidly increased due to human activity, despite findings to the contrary from the majority of climate scientists worldwide.\n\nKaine first won his Senate seat in 2012."]
