Though there are a few gender-neutral toys at places like Walmart and Target, a lot of toys in their selections are still pretty gendered, which means it can be nearly impossible to find home-related toys that aren\u2019t pink or action figures that are female.\n\nLittle kids can and should play with whatever toys they like, which is why giving them gender-neutral gifts gives the freedom to explore their interests without the pressures and stereotypes created by society\u2019s gender norms. That\u2019s something we can get behind.\n\nWith that in mind, we\u2019ve gather nine gender-neutral toys for kids that aren\u2019t pink or blue and cover a wide variety of interests.

He also explains his journey through the foster system and his eventual homelessness after he was kicked out by his foster family weeks after his 18th birthday.\n\nScheer eventually worked his way up in the business world and later met his now husband, Reece. They are dads to four children: 14-year-old Amaya, 11-year-old Makai, 11-year-old Greyson and 9-year-old Tristan, two sets of siblings they fostered and later adopted to build their \u201cforever family.\u201d\n\nMike Caravella/HuffPost Rob Scheer and his husband, Reece, left, fostered two sets of siblings and later adopted all four children.\n\nWhen the family\u2019s foster journey began, Scheer immediately noticed the kids brought their belongings in trash bags \u2015 just as he had as a child. This motivated Scheer to create Comfort Cases, a nonprofit that puts together bags filled with items like pajamas, hygienic products, stuffed animals and books for kids in the foster system across the country.\n\nScheer has also spoken openly about his traumatic childhood and his bouts of depression and addiction later in life. He told HuffPost he\u2019s been criticized for this decision, specifically when it comes to sharing his story with his children, but that he continues to do it so other kids will know their past is what gave them the strength to conquer the future.\n\n\u201cNo. 1, [those critics] don\u2019t walk in my shoes,\u201d Scheer said. \u201cAnd No. 2, we should all be proud of our past, no matter how hard it is.

It is bound to trigger another yet showdown between members who cling to conservative views about marriage and the church\u2019s progressive Christian majority.\n\nBishop Michael Curry, the Episcopal Church\u2019s top leader, said in a statement on Monday that the denomination is committed to the full inclusion of LGBTQ Christians while \u201crespecting the conscience\u201d of those who are opposed to marriage equality.\n\n\u201cAlong with other leaders in The Episcopal Church, I am assessing the implications of the statement and will make determinations about appropriate actions soon,\u201d Curry said.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS The Rev. Cynthia Black (left), and her spouse, Becky Walker, speak with a reporter after Episcopalians voted to allow religious weddings for same-sex couples, July 1, 2015, in Salt Lake City.\n\nThe Rev. Jennifer Adams is a co-convener of the Chicago Consultation, a group that works toward the full inclusion of LGBTQ people in the Episcopal Church and the global network it belongs to, the Anglican Communion. She told HuffPost that LGBTQ Christians often turn to Episcopal churches to \u201cseek shelter\u201d from anti-LGBTQ rhetoric they may encounter in other places. The \u201cdangerous\u201d language Love uses in his directive stokes the fear and hatred many LGBTQ Christians try to escape, she said.\n\n\u201cIt grieves me, and I know it grieves many other Episcopalians that one of our bishops has chosen to speak in these terms,\u201d she wrote in an email.\n\nAlthough the Episcopal Church has made significant strides toward welcoming LGBTQ Christians in recent years, Love\u2019s directive illustrates that deep divisions still exist in the denomination. In 2015 the Episcopal Church authorized its priests to perform same-sex weddings. That resolution gave individual clergy the ability to refuse to conduct such services and gave bishops the right to prohibit same-sex marriages from taking place in their dioceses.\n\nEight of the United States\u2019 101 Episcopal dioceses still don\u2019t allow same-sex weddings, according to the Religion News Service. Love\u2019s Albany diocese already has canonical laws in place that prohibit priests from officiating at or allowing same-sex marriages to take place on church property.\n\nBut at the Episcopal Church\u2019s General Convention this year, leaders passed a resolution meant to give Episcopalians in these remaining eight dioceses the ability to be married in their home churches. Resolution B012, which was passed on July 13, states that bishops who are opposed to marriage equality should invite a bishop from another diocese to provide \u201cpastoral support\u201d \u2015 so that weddings can still take place at a same-sex couple\u2019s home church.\n\nThe resolution is expected to go into effect on Dec. 2.\n\nLove, who has been Albany\u2019s bishop for 12 years, said the resolution is an attempt to silence traditionalists in the Episcopal Church. He said he doesn\u2019t see any issue with same-sex partners living together \u2015 but believes they should remain celibate and unmarried.\n\n\u201cI believe B012 is misguided, heavily flawed and will ultimately do far more damage than good,\u201d Love said. \u201cAs a result, I cannot in good conscience as a bishop in God\u2019s holy Church agree to what is being asked for in B012.\u201d\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS The Most Rev. Bishop Michael Curry is the presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church.\n\nAdams said she believes this summer\u2019s resolution created an opportunity for Love to maintain his personal beliefs while allowing LGBTQ people and inclusive parishes in his diocese to be served by another bishop.\n\n\u201cA gracious, and I believe faithful response would have been for Bishop Love to simply allow for that to happen,\u201d Adams said.\n\nAs a whole, most Episcopalians are supportive of LGBTQ rights. According to the Pew Research Center\u2019s 2014 Religious Landscape Study, 83 percent of those surveyed said homosexuality should be accepted by society, and 74 percent said they were supportive of same-sex marriage.\n\nThe Rev. Jon White, the managing editor of the independent blog Episcopal Cafe, told HuffPost in an email that he believes Love could face disciplinary action for failing to follow a churchwide resolution.\n\nHe said most of the reactions to the letter he has seen from Episcopalians are not supportive of the bishop.\n\n\u201cThe church\u2019s membership is overwhelmingly progressive,\u201d he said, pointing to the wide margins by which the church has passed resolutions in favor of marriage equality.\n\nIn the long run, White said, he suspects Love\u2019s directive will have little impact outside Albany.\n\n\u201cEventually even there, marriage equality will be offered in Episcopal churches,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe full inclusion of our LGBT+ sisters and brothers within the life of the church and marriage equality are invitations of the Holy Spirit into deeper understanding of God\u2019s love and as such, will not easily be brushed aside.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdams said she and other members of the Chicago Consultation remain \u201chopeful and determined\u201d that gay and lesbian Episcopalians in Albany will be fully embraced by the church. She called on Curry, who shot to worldwide fame after delivering an impassioned sermon about love at Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u2019s wedding, to stand with LGBTQ Episcopalians.", "Comics writer Stan Lee died on Monday at the age of 95 after a lifetime creating some of the most iconic and beloved Marvel characters.\n\nIn the decades since he was named editor-in-chief of Timely Publications \u2015 which later became Marvel Comics \u2015 at the age of just 19, Lee helped create timeless superheroes like Spider-Man, Hulk, Thor, the X-Men, the Fantastic Four, Black Panther and Daredevil.\n\nFans and colleagues mourned Lee\u2019s death and remembered him as an legend who helped inspire so many other young writers, artists and actors.

Colorado had one of the nation\u2019s highest rates of staffing vacancies for VHA facilities.\n\nBy Tim Henderson\n\nAs the nation marks Veterans Day, many veterans in rural areas and some cities still face long wait times for health care because there aren\u2019t enough doctors, nurses and support staff to provide it.\n\nAlmost 40,000 of the 335,000 positions in the Veterans Health Administration are vacant, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs, which oversees the VHA. The VHA serves about 9 million veterans.\n\nThe VHA\u2019s turnover rate is less than half the rate for the health care industry overall.\n\nHowever, a Stateline analysis of recently released federal figures shows the VHA has a severe vacancy problem in high-cost urban areas such as Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., and in largely rural states, such as Montana and Colorado.\n\nMontana and Colorado have the highest state job vacancy rates at more than 20 percent, followed by Utah, Oklahoma and Maryland. At the other end, vacancies in Connecticut, Hawaii, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico and Rhode Island are less than 8 percent.\n\nIn some ways, the challenges facing the VHA are the same ones facing the health care workforce as a whole, especially in rural areas like Montana, said Kristin Mattocks, a Montana native and associate professor at the University of Massachusetts Medical School who has studied VHA efforts to improve care for veterans.\n\nNationally, job openings in the health care sector have nearly tripled to 1.1 million since 2010, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Most of the communities with shortages of health care workers are in rural areas, according to the Health Resources and Services Administration. There are also shortages in Honolulu, Hawaii, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.\n\nAs more doctors and other providers in the VHA and elsewhere have been retiring, there\u2019s more pressure on the remaining doctors to absorb more patients and speed up appointments.\n\n\u201cNow the pressure is put on physicians, which is probably driving some folks\u201d away, Mattocks said.\n\nThe vacancy rates, detailed in a new report required by legislation Congress approved this year, can cause long wait times for appointments, create waitlists for artificial limbs and lead to unsanitary conditions.\n\nMost of the nearly 40,000 vacancies are for medical and dental staff such as doctors and nurses. Those professionals are hard to find and keep because VHA\u2019s hiring process is time-consuming and the pay is lower than in the private sector.\n\nAnd because there isn\u2019t sufficient support staff, many VHA doctors say they are frustrated by having to do more paperwork and even clean offices, federal audits have shown.\n\nIn Colorado last year, the Denver Post found that the VHA postponed surgeries because it didn\u2019t have enough anesthesiologists. Understaffing led to dirty storage rooms and canceled surgeries for anesthetized patients at the VHA\u2019s flagship hospital in Washington, D.C.\n\nAnd veterans in Connecticut had a hard time getting appointments for counseling because four key jobs were vacant earlier this year. U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, in a September hearing called the vacancy figures \u201creally staggering.\u201d\n\nBlumenthal added that leaders of the local Veterans of Foreign Wars chapter had complained that care was held up at a Norwich, Connecticut, clinic because the local office lacked a director, a case manager, an outreach coordinator and a counselor.\n\nAt the same hearing, Secretary of Veterans Affairs Robert Wilkie also expressed alarm about the number of vacancies. And he said hiring for mental health centers such as the one in Connecticut is a priority.\n\n\u201cOn its face it is staggering,\u201d Wilkie said. \u201cIf we tried to fill all 40,000 we\u2019d never get where we need. \u2026 We have to concentrate on, I think, four areas: primary care, internists, mental health workers and women\u2019s health.\u201d\n\nHe added that this year\u2019s Mission Act legislation, which President Donald Trump signed in June, will give him more power to raise pay and forgive student loans to attract more medical professionals.\n\nThe agency has stepped up hiring in the past two years, Wilkie said, in response to a 2016 Government Accountability Office report that found that VHA lost an increasing number of employees each year between 2011 and 2015.\n\nIn the five clinical occupations with the worst shortages, including physicians, registered nurses and psychologists, VHA\u2019s employee losses grew from about 5,900 in 2011 to about 7,700 in 2015. Voluntary resignations and retirements were the primary drivers.\n\n\u201cVHA remains fully engaged in a fiercely competitive clinical recruitment market,\u201d the agency said in a statement about the vacancy data. The VA did not respond to requests from Stateline for further comment.\n\nStaffing vacancies have contributed to recent scandals involving long wait times for care \u2014 some veterans died while waiting for appointments \u2014 and the falsifying of wait-time data to deflect scrutiny.\n\nHiring woes continued into 2017, a GAO report said, in part because a federal hiring freeze ordered by Trump limited the agency\u2019s ability to hire doctors. Doctors were exempt from the freeze, but there weren\u2019t enough personnel workers to recruit and hire them, the report concluded, and some were not well-trained to do the job.\n\nThe shortage of trained recruiters undermines the VHA\u2019s effectiveness, the report stated, and \u201cimpedes its ability to improve delivery of health care access to veterans.\u201d\n\nA 2016 report from the congressionally appointed Commission on Care found that VHA doctors and nurses were cleaning offices and doing paperwork because of inadequate numbers of support staff. The commission also detailed a scandal over employees falsifying wait times for service, and some deaths of veterans on waitlists. An understaffed Phoenix administration system struggled to meet a target of 14-day maximum wait times for appointments.\n\nThe report pointed to \u201cstaffing shortages and vacancies\u201d at every level. It also said VHA salaries aren\u2019t competitive, and that the agency \u201ccontinues to use a talent management approach from the last century.\u201d\n\nOther reports have described the effects of those shortcomings. In Washington, D.C., the VA inspector general found conditions so chaotic that sometimes doctors had to borrow equipment from other hospitals during treatment, and surgery was postponed because equipment was discovered missing or broken after the patient was anesthetized. Employees told inspectors the problems were caused by a support staff shortage.\n\nU.S. Sen. Jon Tester, a Montana Democrat, this fall called VHA staffing shortages the most critical issue facing the agency, saying the high rate of vacancies in Montana and elsewhere is hurting care for veterans.\n\n\u201cI continue to hear from veterans across Montana and elsewhere that vacancies and constant turnover in VA facilities impacts how quickly they can get appointments and prevents them from building quality doctor-patient relationships,\u201d Tester, who is running for re-election, wrote in a September letter to Wilkie.\n\nU.S. Sen. Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington state, told Wilkie at the hearing that the fast-growing Seattle area has been particularly hard hit by service shortages. A clinic on the Kitsap Peninsula, west of Seattle, took years to approve and build and will likely be at capacity when it opens next year, Murray said.\n\nNearly a quarter of the staff positions were vacant at VHA facilities in Washington, D.C., and Augusta, Georgia, as of July. But U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson, the Georgia Republican who sponsored the Mission Act, said this fall that things seem to be improving.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve gotten letters from my district, unsolicited, veterans who used to write me about how we weren\u2019t worth anything because we couldn\u2019t get anything done, [now] thanking me for the efficient way the operation works now,\u201d Isakson said at the September hearing.\n\nWilkie, who was confirmed this year, called the job vacancy data \u201can important step in transparency\u201d but stressed that some vacancies are normal and that some represent new positions created to anticipate future growth. Also, Wilkie said, time to complete a specialist referral has fallen from 19 days in 2014 to about one day this year.\n\nThe agency publishes current wait times for appointments, and some facilities with high vacancy-rates have long waits for appointments: The Augusta, Georgia, veterans hospital had a 34-day wait for primary care. Chillicothe, Ohio\u2019s hospital, with one of the country\u2019s lowest vacancy rates, had only a six-day wait.\n\nBut average wait times are high even in some hospitals with low vacancies \u2014 the Honolulu hospital has only about a 2 percent vacancy rate, the lowest in the country, but its average wait time \u2014 39 days \u2014 is one of the highest.", "It\u2019s no secret that scrolling through endless images and announcements of engagements, vacations, new babies and job promotions can make you feel like you\u2019re not accomplishing anything. But it\u2019s pretty much impossible to log off forever and never look back.\n\nHere\u2019s the good news: There might be a sweet spot when it comes to the amount of time you spend on social media. Keeping your use down to just 30 minutes a day can lead to better mental health outcomes, according to research being published in December in the Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology.\n\nResearchers from the University of Pennsylvania looked at social media use among 143 undergraduate students in two separate trials. One trial occurred in the spring and the other a few months later in the fall.\n\nThe study authors monitored the participants\u2019 social media use for a week across three platforms \u2015 Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat \u2015 to get a baseline. Then researchers gauged the students\u2019 mental health based on seven different factors: social support, fear of missing out, loneliness, self-acceptance, self-esteem, anxiety, and depression.\n\nNext, the authors separated the students into groups and conducted the experiment for three weeks. One group was told to keep using social media as usual; another group was tasked with limiting social media use to 10 minutes per platform a day. Researchers then looked at how the students fared in the seven categories after the experiment.\n\nOscar Wong via Getty Images When college students cut down their social media use to 30 minutes per day total, they experienced a \u201csignificant improvement in well-being,\u201d according to researchers.\n\nWhen study volunteers cut down their social media use to 30 minutes per day total, they experienced a \u201csignificant improvement in well-being,\u201d exhibiting reduced loneliness and depression, the authors wrote. Anxiety and FOMO decreased in both groups, which researchers said could be due to increased self-monitoring during the experiment portion of the study.\n\n\u201cIt is a little ironic that reducing your use of social media actually makes you feel less lonely,\u201d lead study author Melissa Hunt told ScienceDaily. \u201cSome of the existing literature on social media suggests there\u2019s an enormous amount of social comparison that happens. When you look at other people\u2019s lives, particularly on Instagram, it\u2019s easy to conclude that everyone else\u2019s life is cooler or better than yours.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you look at other people\u2019s lives, particularly on Instagram, it\u2019s easy to conclude that everyone else\u2019s life is cooler or better than yours.\u201d - Melissa Hunt, lead study author\n\nThere are a few caveats with this study: The participants only used iPhones in the experiment because the devices can track and provide objective social media app usage data. The study also only monitored students who used Instagram, Facebook and Snapchat, so it doesn\u2019t reflect experiences with other social media platforms (shoutout to anyone who goes down the negative rabbit hole known as Twitter). The study authors also don\u2019t know if these findings could be replicated for another age group.\n\nAll that aside, there is something to be said for limiting social media while still being realistic about the fact that you\u2019re never going to ditch it entirely. Research has shown that excessive Facebook use can contribute to increased depression and loneliness, and a 2014 study found that social media use can create social comparison, which can lead to lower self-esteem.\n\nBottom line: We can all benefit from a little break.

Reagan, bowing to the zealots from whom he helped amass enormous power (power they still wield with President Donald Trump), was among the most anti-gay presidents in history, ignoring the AIDS epidemic until far too late.\n\nRohrabacher was first elected to Congress in 1988, at the end of the Reagan administration, representing a district in Orange County, a bastion of conservatism in the \u201980s and beyond. He was among a trio of California right-wing Republican congressmen \u2015 including Bob Dornan and William Dannemeyer \u2015 who demonized people with AIDS in that era, voted against efforts to stem the epidemic and battle discrimination and pushed legislation that was discriminatory against LGBTQ people.\n\nRohrabacher also teamed up with the virulently anti-gay Sen.

There are lots of ways you can make progress on climate change, whether through courts or cities, or working to replace coal plants at the local level.\u201d\n\nAnd other efforts without an obvious environmental focus matter too.\n\nThe Sierra Club threw its support behind several of what it calls \u201cpro-democracy\u201d measures, such as independent redistricting commissions and measures to enhance ballot access, that Brune said could result in new leadership and change not just the electorate but how they respond to climate change issues. Most are measures pushed by Democrats, who also are more likely than Republicans to favor environmental regulations.\n\nThe losses on green measures stuck out as voters nationwide backed numerous policies generally supported by progressives. Florida, for example, approved a measure that returns voting rights to 1.5 million people with a felony record. Michigan approved recreational marijuana. Missouri passed a minimum wage hike.\n\nThere were some environmental victories too.\n\nFlorida voters approved a measure that bars offshore oil and gas drilling in state waters. (Florida law already bars such drilling, but the measure adds the drilling ban to the state constitution.) And Nevada voters said \u201cyes\u201d to a renewable energy measure like the one rejected by Arizonans.\n\nBut even as natural disasters of increasing strength hit communities and consensus grows in the United States among voters that climate change is real and caused by humans, only 7 percent of voters in a national Associated Press poll, taken in the days leading up to the election, said they considered the environment to be their top issue.\n\n\u201cWe need to translate climate change to people\u2019s daily lives\u201d to make a difference at the ballot box, said Kevin Curtis, head of the NRDC Action Fund, the political wing of the Natural Resources Defense Council, a national advocacy group. \u201cThat means making it more real and more immediate. The bad news is the impacts really are starting to show up daily, and people are starting to become aware of that. Our job is to accelerate that understanding.\u201d\n\nCurtis said he was encouraged by the number of Democratic governors elected who he said, along with legislators and cabinet secretaries, may be in a better position than voters to enact detailed climate policy.\n\nDemocrats have flipped seven governors\u2019 offices and will control the executive and legislative branches in 14 states. Curtis pointed to Gov.-elect J.B. Pritzker in Illinois, who pledged to bring the state to 100 percent renewable energy by 2050. Gov.-elect Jared Polis in Colorado campaigned on getting 100 percent clean energy there by 2040, which would be the most aggressive pace in the nation.\n\nCarbon Tax a \u2018Non-Starter\u2019\n\nWashington\u2019s ballot measure would have established the nation\u2019s first price on carbon. The campaign for and against the measure was the most expensive in Washington history.\n\nThe \u201cNo\u201d campaign, spearheaded by the Western States Petroleum Association, raised more than $30 million from oil giants such as BP and Phillips 66. The \u201cYes\u201d campaign counted former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Microsoft\u2019s Bill Gates among its top five donors, along with environmental groups, for the roughly $15 million raised.\n\nWashington\u2019s 1631 initiative would have charged utilities $15 per ton of carbon produced starting in 2020, raising it gradually to $55 a ton in 2035. In a 2016 report to the Washington Legislature, the state Department of Ecology found that the state produced about 94 million tons of carbon in 2013.\n\nVoters rejected a similar measure in 2016. But while the previous proposal was a tax, allowing legislators to spend the money freely once it reached state coffers, this year\u2019s measure was a fee, requiring the revenue be spent on environmental programs. The state estimated the fee would bring in $2.2 billion in the first five years.\n\nOpponents quickly labeled this year\u2019s proposal a tax anyway, saying it would add about $300 a year to families\u2019 energy bills. Proponents said that figure would be closer to about $120 a year.\n\nSupporters say they are not giving up. But with both approaches failing to resonate with voters, it\u2019s unclear what sort of proposal the legislature might pursue.\n\n\u201cWe will definitely be pushing in the upcoming legislative session for something like this, because the problem is not going away. It\u2019s not an option,\u201d said Nick Abraham, spokesman for Yes on 1631, Washington\u2019s carbon fee campaign.\n\nYoram Bauman, an economist who crafted and spearheaded Washington\u2019s 2016 measure, said the green movement too often blames campaign spending by the fossil fuel industry for an inability to get votes, rather than trying to build a coalition that includes those industries in negotiating a compromise policy.\n\n\u201cMy fear is they are going to double down on campaign finance reform and say oil is buying the election,\u201d Bauman said of environmental activists. \u201cBut if you\u2019re going to have to wait to have climate action until after we have campaign finance reform, well, call me when I\u2019m dead.\u201d\n\nCurtis with NRDC Action Fund said that for a carbon tax to have its intended effect of reducing people\u2019s fossil fuel use, \u201cit has to be so darn high it\u2019s politically a non-starter.\u201d\n\nGiven that uphill battle, he thinks it may make more sense to pursue policies that require states to get a certain percentage of their energy from renewable sources.\n\nHowever, as Arizona and Nevada showed this year, the results can be mixed.\n\nBig Money\n\nThe campaign against Arizona\u2019s Proposition 127 was the most expensive in state history. It drew more than $50 million in political spending, of which more than $30 million was spent in opposition. The parent company of the state\u2019s largest utility, Arizona Public Services, was the largest funder against the measure.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re going against entrenched interests willing to spend millions of dollars to muddy the waters, it becomes a \u2018no\u2019 vote when there\u2019s any confusion at all,\u201d said D.J. Quinlan, a spokesman for the Yes on 127 campaign. \u201cYou can see people at polling places saying, \u2018I really love solar power and would love to invest, but I\u2019m not sure this ballot measure is the right way to do that.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve said throughout this campaign there is a better way to create a clean-energy future for Arizona that is also affordable and reliable,\u201d said Don Brandt, Arizona Public Services chairman, president and CEO, in a statement election night. The company said it would organize \u201can effort to gather ideas and seek input from customers and stakeholders.\u201d\n\nDavid Zalubowski/The Associated Press A Colorado ballot measure would have required oil development be at least 2,500 feet away from homes. Current law requires oil fracking take place 500 feet away from homes and 1,000 feet away from schools.\n\nColorado's measure would have required oil drilling to be about a half-mile away from parks, homes and businesses.\n\n\"Our state has spoken loud and clear that we recognize the importance of the industry to the state's economic well-being,\" Tracee Bentley, executive director of Colorado Petroleum Council, which represents the oil and natural gas industry, said in a statement about the measure's defeat.\n\nKelly Nordini, executive director of Conservation Colorado, which supported the measure, did not see it that way.\n\n\"No one in this state would be foolish enough to say that tonight's result means that voters want an oil and gas rig closer to their homes, schools or hospitals,\" she said in a statement issued Tuesday. \"We need our leaders to take action in 2019 to ensure that Colorado has the strongest protections in the West.\"\n\nIn Arizona, supporters of the failed initiative criticized the Republican-led attorney general's office for adding language to the summary that appeared on ballots saying utilities would have to meet the energy standards \"irrespective of cost.\" The measure did not address cost; it only specified that utilities must get 50 percent of their electricity from renewable sources.\n\nAn August email obtained by the Arizona Republic showed the state\u2019s election director questioned the additional wording from the attorney general\u2019s office.\n\n\"The Prop. 127 language is certainly eyebrow-raising because it cites information exogenous to the ballot measure itself,\" wrote State Election Director Eric Spencer, the Republic reported. \"But I'm sure you've calculated the legal and political risks of adding that.\"\n\nQuinlan said the manipulated ballot language didn't reflect the wording of the actual measure.", "Tap here to turn on desktop notifications to get the news sent straight to you.", "A wildfire in northern California\u2019s Butte County has destroyed over 6,700 structures and killed at least 29 people, with fires reaching temperatures hot enough to melt metal.

The first trailer arrived Monday and the film, helmed by \u201cGoosebumps\u201d director Rob Letterman, is set to hit theaters May 10, 2019.\n\n\u201cDetective Pikachu,\u201d inspired by the video game of the same name, is the first entry in a forthcoming live-action Pok\u00e9mon film universe.\n\nBased in Ryme City, where humans and Pok\u00e9mon live side by side in harmony, the film kicks into gear when Tim Goodman (\u201cJurassic World: Fallen Kingdom\u201d star Justice Smith) partners with the particularly smart Detective Pikachu.\n\nThe two join forces to solve the mystery of the young man\u2019s missing father, and they butt heads with plenty of familiar faces along the way.

When she was born, her uncle, who was also an astrologer, calculated her birth chart by hand.\n\nSo when she began pursuing a career in astrology in 2013, none of her friends or family members were all that surprised. \u201cThey were like, \u2018You\u2019ve been asking all of our signs for as long as anyone can remember,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cNeedless to say, when I decided to start a dating app based on astrology in 2013, it didn\u2019t feel shocking or weird. It felt like the natural order of my career.\u201d\n\nIn 2013 she co-founded an astrology-based dating app but wasn\u2019t yet a full-on astrologer. She and another founder connected with Broadly astrologer Annabel Gat, who advised on their app. A friendship and a mentorship quickly blossomed. Kelly was soon taking Gat\u2019s classes, reading up on as much information about astrology as she could get her hands on and training intensely to become an astrologer. She dove in trying to figure out how to combine something she loves with something lucrative, and the work paid off.\n\nToday, in addition to a biweekly column for Allure, Kelly hosts seminars and videos and has published three books, including one connecting astrology and mixology. Who better, then, to tell us what it looks like to make a living by reading charts and studying the stars?\n\nHuffPost spoke to her about why we\u2019re so interested in astrology right now, how a good horoscope is constructed, what to look out for when seeking the work of an astrologer and more.\n\nDamon Dahlen/HuffPost\n\nOn manifestation \u201cThe week I decided to call myself an astrologer is the same week [Allure] contacted me to do their horoscopes. I tell a lot of my clients that in order for them to manifest something, they need to be specific and they need to say it out loud. A big part of manifestation is to be very clear about your intentions. You can\u2019t be wishy-washy. I had done hundreds of charts, but when I started exploring putting a price on that reading and experience was the same week I got a random e-mail [from the magazine].\n\n\u201cThe fact that I have been able to support myself exclusively doing astrology the past few years is remarkable to me, I feel so grateful. But I think it\u2019s also a reflection of when you feel like you know what you love to do and nothing is going to stop you, you have to commit to it.\u201d\n\nOn how the 2016 election has affected astrology\u2019s popularity\n\n\u201cIn 2013, it was like pulling teeth to try to get astrology content somewhere. The stigma surrounding it was that it was for your freaky aunt who had a beaded entry into her bedazzled hallway. It was so retro and kitschy. Fast-forward to 2016, when we have an election that really throws people off balance. I think, as a society, we start to realize that there really isn\u2019t grounding on earth and that there actually could be some more answers if we look up and stop trying to rationalize everything going on in our own world, start exploring alternative ways of thinking about things.\u201d\n\nOn being wary of social media\n\n\u201cGiven how popular social media has made astrology right now, some people are making amazing astrology memes. That does not mean they are astrologers. I have spent countless hours investing in becoming an astrologer. At a certain point, I was taking classes four nights a week. It\u2019s a little dangerous, especially if you\u2019re paying someone who doesn\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about.\u201d\n\nOn how a good horoscope is formed\n\n\u201cHow an astrologer writes a horoscope is that they look at this thing called an ephemeris, a table that shows the position of every single planet in the sky each day. A daily horoscope looks at where the moon is in relation to Saturn on this given day. A monthly horoscope, you\u2019re going to see the most important milestones of what happens over the course of the month. From there we know the planets as well as the signs have certain expressions and energies, so we create these algorithms between putting the planet with the sign and seeing what relationship and connection they are making to other planets and those signs. What differentiates a good astrologer from a great one is someone who can figure out how to make that information relatable and relevant, not just these \u2018So what?\u2019 ideas.\u201d\n\nOn ways the connection between planets and signs has played out in pop culture\n\n\u201cIn October 2017, Jupiter, which is the planet of expansion and abundance, which sort of enlarges whatever it touches, moved into the sign of Scorpio, which is associated with the underworld and secrets and sex. That occurred the same week the Harvey Weinstein scandal broke. Over the course of that year, we saw all these secrets being enlarged and exposed. When Jupiter went into retrograde was around the time all the celebrities wore black to the Golden Globes, and we were like, \u2018Wait, is this what this is about? It has to be about making change.\u2019 ... When we attribute cosmic movement to things that happen in our society, we can really watch them unfold before our eyes.\u201d\n\nOn skeptics\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t spend much time talking to people who are skeptical of astrology. I\u2019m not their target audience. [Laughs.] In society we have been told that if something can\u2019t be proven, if something isn\u2019t physically real or a statement hasn\u2019t been made, then it doesn\u2019t exist. I find that to be complete BS and ultimately prohibitive of people\u2019s emotions, how different people are and how we move through the world. In the question of if astrology is real, it doesn\u2019t really matter. If it\u2019s a vocabulary that makes sense and can be used to create empathy for oneself and others, then it works.\n\n\u201cWhen we talk about astrology, we\u2019re talking about thousands of years of exploration and study, history and academics. We can say all of it is rubbish, and some people do. But others, like myself, take a lot of credence in the fact that this is something that would literally connect us to the Babylonians if we traveled back in time 5,000 years. There are not a lot of things we could talk to our ancient ancestors about, but if we talked to them about what it\u2019s like to be an Aries, they would understand \u2015 and they would agree.\u201d\n\nOn why we care about astrology as it pertains to dating\n\n\u201cWhen you start dating someone, the first thing you wonder is if your sign matches. I think we want to understand things that feel abstract and vague. And I think, especially for very curious people, they want to know if there is some greater force and purpose behind both good and shitty relationships.\u201d\n\nOn making astrology more accessible\n\n\u201cMy book was the first big project I had where I felt super-excited to find a great gateway between astrology and something fun and relatable. I\u2019m not an asshole \u2014 I know people need to be able to enter astrology without it being super-pretentious and academic. For me, I started reading astrology back when I wanted to know if my Libra boyfriend at the time and I were compatible. For other people, cocktails are just as good an entry point \u2014 whatever someone can connect to that is real and based in truth but that doesn\u2019t make them feel shut out.\u201d\n\nOn advice for burgeoning astrologers\n\n\u201cWork with an astrologer. Apprentice for someone who is the real deal that you can either take private classes with or who can recommend certain books and workshops. There are a ton of webinars available you can join for, like, 10 bucks. Just make sure you\u2019re working with people, and don\u2019t believe everything you read on the internet.\u201d\n\nOn astrology red flags", "When I went to bed on the night of the 2018 midterm elections, I was heartbroken. Yes, the Democrats had taken back the House of Representatives, but the candidates I had been most invested in \u2015 Stacey Abrams, Andrew Gillum and Beto O\u2019Rourke \u2015 had lost.\n\nI knew O\u2019Rourke, despite his magnetism, probably wouldn\u2019t get it done.\n\nMy hopes were much higher for Abrams and Gillum. The polls conducted on their races showed these exceptional Black candidates tied or ahead leading into Election Day, a seeming miracle to me as a daughter of the South. I knew, though, that Abrams and Gillum were up against tremendous structural obstacles. Obstacles that political wit and charisma might not help them get over.\n\nAbrams\u2019 contest against Brian Kemp, who as Georgia\u2019s then-secretary of state would oversee his own election, was especially troublesome. In August, Abrams called Kemp \u201ca remarkable architect of voter suppression\u201d because of his department\u2019s history of removing Georgians from voter rolls, rejecting high numbers of registrations and closing or moving voting sites.\n\nBy Tuesday night\u2019s end, neither Abrams or Gillum had the votes to claim victory. Gillum conceded by urging his supporters to continue fighting for their seat at the table. Abrams, however, refused to give in.\n\n\u201cDemocracy only works when we work for it, when we fight for it, when we demand it,\u201d she told supporters. Abrams vowed to remain in the race until every ballot was counted. The Abrams campaign believes Kemp claimed victory prematurely because there are thousands of absentee ballots, provisional ballots and military votes that have not been tallied.\n\nShe made the right call.\n\nNow is not the time to bow out gracefully. Now is the time to combat the deep-seated culture of corruption Republicans have cultivated in our elections.\n\nKemp, his camp and his supporters are counting on Abrams to accept the loss and the questionable circumstances that surround it without hesitation. She risks looking like a sore loser and emboldening those who believe in racist, sexist stereotypes.\n\nWomen are supposed to be grateful, simply, for the opportunity to compete. Black people are not supposed to fight for the things powerful white men think themselves entitled to. They\u2019re told to accept their place as second-class citizens and make way for the status quo.\n\nAs a Black woman, Abrams has additional baggage to slough off in the form of scripts about her anger and aggression. Certainly, she knows this. But she couldn\u2019t have gotten to her position by letting bigoted perceptions dictate her actions.\n\nNow is not the time to bow out gracefully. Now is the time to combat the deep-seated culture of corruption Republicans have cultivated in our elections. Not just for the people of Georgia, but for every American whose vote needs protection.\n\nIf there\u2019s an outside chance that the gap can be closed, this Democratic nominee should pursue it. Moreover, with litigation, the Abrams campaign has an opportunity to expose a myriad of alleged offenses that were the result of Kemp\u2019s lack of oversight. They owe it to every person who cast a ballot, who stood out in the rain, who mailed in an absentee ballot to make sure their vote is counted.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Abrams campaign manager Lauren Groh-Wargo posed critical questions that the secretary of state's office has yet to answer.\n\nIn a press conference on Thursday morning, Abrams campaign manager Lauren Groh-Wargo posed critical questions that the secretary of state\u2019s office has yet to answer. Why were polling places in Democratic strongholds equipped with too few machines and ballots, which resulted in three-hour wait times? Why haven\u2019t all absentee ballots been accepted? When will we know the vote tallies for provisional and military voters?\n\nGroh-Wargo noted that this information is public, and Kemp\u2019s former office should be prepared to provide a full accounting.\n\nWhen reporters pressed Abrams campaign chairwoman Allegra Lawrence Hardy to provide an end date to the campaign\u2019s quest, she echoed Abrams by making it clear they would fight until they were satisfied with the tallies they\u2019re presented.\n\nAbrams is brave to continue her push. This isn\u2019t sour grapes.\n\nEvery political candidate wants to win. But every candidate is not as committed as Abrams to speaking up and taking any flack that comes. They should not concede to an unearned victory.\n\nThe more than 1.5 million Georgians who cast ballots for Abrams should be assured of the integrity of the elections in their state. If they are being cheated, let it come to light. Their candidate is now their advocate.\n\nEvery day that she refuses to relent, Abrams makes the statement that Democratic constituents are worth fighting for.\n\nCritics can say what they want about Abrams. They can call her \u201cnot very classy\u201d and \u201cembarrassing,\u201d but niceties are of no value in the trenches. Abrams is precisely the kind of politician the left needs right now.\n\nThis is a critical time of transition for the Democratic Party. Nancy Pelosi, the presumptive speaker of the House, said recently that we have a \u201cresponsibility to seek common ground\u201d with members of a political party that uses its power to openly discriminate against the country\u2019s most vulnerable people. Abrams embodies the ethic of those voices in the Democratic Party who say civility is not more important than justice.\n\nDonald Trump and his GOP base are always raring for a fight. It\u2019s time progressives meet them, not for the sake of ego, but for the preservation of democracy.\n\nAny realist can see that the likelihood Abrams will win is fairly slim, but even if she doesn\u2019t become the governor, these efforts are not in vain. Every day that she refuses to relent, Abrams makes the statement that Democratic constituents are worth fighting for.", "Comic book legend Stan Lee died on Monday and celebrities who have portrayed his Marvel Universe characters in movies and on TV are posting emotional tributes to his life.\n\nLee, who died at the age of 95, helped create some of the best-known comic book characters of all time, including Spider-Man, Hulk, Thor, the X-Men, the Fantastic Four and Daredevil.\n\n\u201cStan Lee\u2019s passion, charisma, and his love for the characters and stories he created shaped Marvel into what it is today,\u201d Dan Buckley, president of Marvel Entertainment, said in a statement. \u201cHis spirit lives on in the people he\u2019s inspired.

At first, it seemed the Blue Wave wasn\u2019t quite what was predicted. But with each passing day came more and more good news for Democrats and progressives. The Washington Post quoted a terrific quip making the rounds in the House Democratic Caucus \u2015 that this year\u2019s midterms were more like Hanukkah than Christmas \u2015 several days of gifts.\n\nStill, to hear conservatives and corporate Democrats tell it, Election Day was not a good day for progressives. Every day, The Wall Street Journal publishes another opinion piece contending that the Democratic victory was less than it seemed. Kimberley Strassel, cherry-picking a few high-profile losses in Friday\u2019s WSJ, declared: \u201cBiggest Loser: Elizabeth Warren.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, in the same space, political scientist Allen Guelzo invidiously compared Tuesday\u2019s Democratic House pickup of \u201conly\u201d between 35 and 40 House seats to the election of 1932, when the Democrats did a bit better and flipped 46. FDR in 1932! I\u2019d say that\u2019s pretty good company. In fact, this year saw the biggest Democratic midterm gains since the post-Watergate blowout of 1974, when Dems took 49 Republican seats.\n\nYou kind of expect this lame spinning from the Journal. Far more insidious is the corporate Democrat spin machine called Third Way.\n\nTo hear this band of Wall Street Democrats tell it, centrist Democrats had a great night, while progressives were losers. This selective use of statistics has all the intellectual honesty of an offering prospectus for subprime derivatives. Third Way bragged that 23 of its endorsed candidates were among those who flipped Republican seats. Yes, but in fact many of those were substantive progressives, including Sharice Davids (Kansas), Jason Crow (Colorado), Anne Kirkpatrick (Arizona) and Abigail Spanberger (Virginia). As a House member, even Beto O\u2019Rourke (!) was part of the supposedly centrist New Democrat Coalition.\n\nTo believe that \u201cmoderates\u201d were Tuesday\u2019s big winners, you\u2019d have to redefine what it means to be a moderate. Most Democratic winners, even those backed by Third Way, were advocates of expanded Medicare and Social Security, better minimum wage protection and more control of prescription drug pricing.\n\nThird Way is quick to point out that if you look at standard polls, you find that more Americans characterize themselves as moderates or conservatives than as liberals. But if you dig deeper, you find that the majority of voters are substantive progressives. In fact, the percentage of Democrats who identify as liberal rather than moderate has risen steadily in the past decade. By 2018, more than half of all Democrats considered themselves liberal.\n\nMore to the point, a large majority of Americans are substantively progressive once we go beyond superficial labels. Fully 70 percent support Medicare for All, a figure that includes 82 percent of self-identified Democrats and even 52 percent of Republicans as well as a majority of independents. Large majorities also support making higher education debt-free. Pew found that 58 percent of Americans support a $15 minimum wage. According to Gallup, 62 percent of Americans approve of unions, a 15-year high. Gallup also found broad majority support for a large infrastructure program.\n\nProgressive is the new moderate. And by clearly addressing pocketbook frustrations, progressive Democrats show the power of that message to bridge over race.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Supporters of Sharice Davids celebrate her victory over the Republican incumbent, Kevin Yoder, in their Kansas House race.\n\nIn Florida, a flat-out economic progressive, Andrew Gillum, came within an ace of winning the governorship (and may yet win), as a black man in a state that is only about 19 percent African-American. Same story with Stacey Abrams in Georgia, where the population is around 31 percent black.\n\nThese candidates were far from Third Way-type centrists. Despite the legacy of racism in those two states, Gillum and Abrams turned in amazing performances as pocketbook progressives, and won the support of a lot of white voters. For years, centrist Democrats have tried to win these governorships, and have failed by wider margins.\n\nIn Newt Gingrich\u2019s old district, GA-6, which is just 15 percent black, Jon Ossoff narrowly lost a long-shot bid in the special election of June 2017. But this time, a black woman, Lucy McBath, whose 17-year-old son was murdered at a gas station in 2012 by a racist white man, narrowly won the seat, which Republicans had held since 1978. McBath won in the Atlanta suburbs, incredibly enough, calling for gun control, Medicare for everyone over age 55 and a higher minimum wage.\n\nDavids is Native American and openly lesbian. Her district, KS-3, is suburban and 83 percent white. Colin Allred, a black civil rights lawyer and former NFL player, won his Dallas seat in a huge upset, ousting Republican Pete Sessions. The district is just 11 percent African-American. Former Rhodes scholar Antonio Delgado, who is African-American, ousted John Faso in upstate New York, in a district that is just 4 percent black and that backed Donald Trump two years earlier.\n\nThe fact that white Southerners and other non-urban voters in 2018 are willing to vote for black economic progressives tells us that America is ready to move beyond Trump\u2019s message of tribal hate, and that pocketbook issues are a key part of the winning strategy. In all, eight African-American candidates picked up seats formerly held by Republicans, all of them in majority-white districts, all running as economic progressives.\n\nLoren Elliott via Getty Images Beto O\u2019Rourke performed better than any statewide Texas Democrat in decades by running as an unapologetic progressive.\n\nDemocrats made major gains not just in the suburbs, but in Trump country. Despite the conventional wisdom that America is more severely divided than ever between metro centers that back Democrats and rural areas that vote Republican, in 2018 not only were cities and their suburbs more intensively blue, but there was a 5 percent swing back to Democrats in rural counties. That\u2019s not huge, but a lot of elections are decided by much smaller margins.\n\nIn Virginia\u2019s 7th District, which combines Richmond suburbs and hardcore Trump country to the rural north and south, Spanberger, a married mother of three and former CIA analyst, won a marquee race to oust one of the House Freedom Caucus leaders, Dave Brat. Brat was a hero to the far right for defeating the former Republican Majority Leader, Eric Cantor, in a bitter 2014 primary fight.\n\nSpanberger emphasized health care and prescription drug costs, calling for a Medicare public option and patent reforms to reduce drug company monopoly pricing power, as well as a change in the law to allow Medicare to negotiate bulk pricing discounts the way the VA is able to. In 2016, Brat beat his Democratic opponent, Eileen Bedell, by 15 points. In 2018, Spanberger beat him by 2 points, gaining ground in the district\u2019s rural areas as well as the suburbs.\n\nThird Way claimed Spanberger as one of its own. If this is the new centrism, let\u2019s have more of it.\n\nAnd of course, Beto O\u2019Rourke performed better than any statewide Texas Democrat in decades, running as an unapologetic progressive. Sherrod Brown in Ohio and Jon Tester in Montana kept their Senate seats as economic populists. Joe Donnelly in Indiana and Claire McCaskill in Missouri lost theirs by pulling their punches.\n\nIf the Democrats can win in Trump country by running progressives, why on earth should they run Wall Street-friendly centrists, even if centrists can also sometimes win?\n\nDonnelly ran attack ads distancing himself from the \u201cradical left.\u201d McCaskill ran a radio ad attacking \u201ccrazy Democrats\u201d; she went on Fox News to criticize Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.\n\nBoth cast votes to weaken bank regulation. In Tennessee, former Gov. Phil Bredesen (D), the great moderate hope, declared that he would have voted to confirm Brett Kavanaugh had he been in the Senate. He went on to lose his election by nearly 11 points.\n\nIn fairness, it\u2019s possible to cherry-pick examples either way. There were some Democrats who took Republican seats running as Third Way-type centrists, such as Max Rose in New York\u2019s Staten Island. There were others \u2015 more of them \u2015 who flipped Republican seats as economic progressives. There were also some Democrats who lost long-shot battles running as populists, such as Richard Ojeda in West Virginia and Randy Bryce in Paul Ryan\u2019s former Wisconsin seat. Bernie Sanders\u2019 spinoff group Our Revolution had a bad night statistically, having put its energy mostly in long-shot candidates.\n\nHere\u2019s the point. The grassroots energy is clearly with progressives. And if the Democrats can win in Trump country by running progressives, why on earth should they run Wall Street-friendly centrists, even if centrists can also sometimes win? Progressives are more likely to win back Trump voters and more likely to address the deep-seated economic frustrations that incubate Trumpism, and more likely to bridge over schisms of race that otherwise fragment the Democratic coalition.\n\nThe 2018 midterms bode well for 2020, not just for a big Democratic victory but \u2015 just as importantly \u2015 for a progressive victory.", "Stan Lee, the co-creator of countless Marvel comic book characters that have become staples in pop culture, died on Monday at the age of 95.\n\nLee had previously suffered a health scare in January, when he was rushed to a Los Angeles hospital after experiencing shortness of breath and an irregular heartbeat, according to a TMZ report. A representative for Lee told the outlet the next day that he was stable and would be \u201cstaying there for a few days for some check ups as a safety precaution.\u201d\n\nIn March, The Daily Beast reported that Lee was being financially \u201cpicked apart\u201d as his health declined. Among those defrauding Lee were his daughter\u2019s former business associate and his long-time bodyguard.\n\nLee\u2019s daughter Joan Celia is his sole heir.\n\nLee was born Stanley Martin Lieber in New York City on Dec. 28, 1922, to Romanian-born Jewish immigrants. He got his start at Timely Publications as an assistant in 1939, where he would do menial jobs like refill ink wells and fetch lunch for the staff. Eventually, he moved up to become a text filler for the actual comics, co-creating his first ever hero, The Destroyer.\n\nWhen then-editor Joe Simon and legendary artist Jack Kirby left Timely in 1941, the publisher Martin Goodman made Stan Lee \u2015 just 19 years old at the time \u2015 editor-in-chief.\n\nTimely would later become Atlas Comics and finally Marvel Comics, which Lee continued running and writing for until 1972, when he took the role of publisher. Gradually, Lee factored into the day-to-day business less and less, becoming more of the figurehead and ambassador we knew him as.\n\nBarbara Davidson via Getty Images \u201cFor years, kids have been asking me what\u2019s the greatest superpower,\u201d Lee said in 2016. \u201cI always say luck. If you\u2019re lucky, everything works. I\u2019ve been lucky.\u201d\n\nAlong with the talents of Jack Kirby (who had rejoined the company), Steve Ditko and Bill Everett, Lee helped create superheroes like Spider-Man, Hulk, Thor, the X-Men, the Fantastic Four, Black Panther and Daredevil \u2015 all of whom existed within the same universe. It\u2019s a fairly obvious concept for audiences in the era of \u201cThe Avengers\u201d and \u201cJustice League\u201d films, but back then, it was a different and exciting idea.\n\nWith Kirby\u2019s signature visuals and Lee\u2019s down-to-earth prose, Marvel created a new superhero narrative that had not been seen in mainstream comics: Superheroes were no longer perfect. They had problems like ordinary people, problems they couldn\u2019t solve with superpowers. They couldn\u2019t pay bills on time, got dumped and felt depressed. His characters were relatable.\n\nThere has always been debate regarding how responsible both Lee and Kirby were in the creation of these iconic, and very lucrative, characters. But it is difficult to deny that Stan Lee played a large part in bringing this modern era of realism and grit to the comic book world.\n\n\u201cFor years, kids have been asking me what\u2019s the greatest superpower,\u201d Lee told The Hollywood Reporter in 2016. \u201cI always say luck.

I\u2019ve been watching it three to five times in a sitting, ever since it came out. Every time I tear up.\n\nBut the reason I get emotional doesn\u2019t have so much to do with the fact that it\u2019s a book series that I very much relate to and love. What really gets me is that I have Stargardt disease \u2014 a condition similar to macular degeneration, which renders me legally blind, or having low vision \u2014 and probably won\u2019t be able to watch the series.\n\nFerrante\u2019s Neapolitan novels were written in Italian before being translated for a global audience and HBO has decided that the dialogue in its hotly anticipated new series will stay true to the source material (not just Italian but a Neapolitan dialect), which means it\u2019ll be entirely in subtitles.\n\nIt\u2019s a cool move, and HBO has patted itself on the back for its devotion to authenticity, especially since other Italy-set series, such as \u201cRome\u201d and \u201cThe Young Pope,\u201d had English dialogue.\n\nBut I can\u2019t read subtitles. I can\u2019t even read the notes my loved ones write on my birthday cards without someone\u2019s help or a magnifier. I also can\u2019t read street signs, which caused me to lose my driver\u2019s license, uproot my entire life and move to New York City, which has better public transportation than my hometown, at age 29. It\u2019s a similar story for countless other people with visual disabilities.\n\nMany people with visual disabilities often rely on a feature called video description or audio description when they watch TV. It is a feature in which a narrator tells someone who can\u2019t see well what is happening on the screen.\n\nPeople with low vision don\u2019t use it all the time. For example, I can usually watch TV with relative ease, just as long as I\u2019m sitting a few inches from the screen. But those who are blind and have more severe cases of low vision depend on it. HBO won\u2019t be including audio description for \u201cMy Brilliant Friend,\u201d though.\n\nWith HBO\u2019s decision to not feature audio description, the premium cable network has decided to embrace one culture while completely alienating another that already has to navigate life with endless obstacles.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t anything new. The network has been ignoring the basic needs of the blind and low-vision community for as long as it\u2019s been in existence.\n\nHBO confirmed to HuffPost that it does not offer video description services for any of its programming. In this case, audio description could also have easily been used to translate the Italian dialogue into English, according to Joel Snyder, president of Audio Description Associates, a company that makes video descriptions.\n\nSnyder said it could be done much like an audiobook. For example, one audio describer or voice actor could read the script\u2019s action lines in one voice or tone and then use a distinctively different voice or tone for the dialogue. It could also be done with multiple voice actors, one of which reads the action lines and another (or others) who read or act out the dialogue.\n\n\u201cA skilled audio describer who has researched pronunciations could even make the subtitles more meaningful,\u201d he told me.\n\nThough it may seem like the final product could be confusing to listen to, Diane Johnson, president and CEO of an audio description company called Descriptive Video that does audio descriptions for Netflix original series such as \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d \u201cBoJack Horseman,\u201d \u201cDear White People\u201d and \u201cAmerican Vandal,\u201d told me that isn\u2019t the case. For instance, when she was first asked by the streaming service to do audio description for their original series \u201cNarcos,\u201d a show that uses numerous languages, she was concerned there would be \u201ca lot going on.\u201d\n\nBut after conducting focus groups for people in Spanish and English who listened to the video description for the show, she realized it could be done in a clear manner.\n\nSo, if an audio description company can figure out how to tackle a complicated script and deliver a clear product that aids millions of potential viewers, why wouldn\u2019t HBO want to take advantage of that? Especially since Johnson told me it could be done quickly and it is affordable\n\nFrankly, it\u2019s insulting, ablelist and reinforces the notion in society that people with disabilities are less than those without.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019m new to being ostracized by HBO because \u201cMy Brilliant Friend\u201d is the first of its original series in the U.S. to be aired in another language, according to The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nYet, people who are completely blind or have more severe cases of low vision have never been able to watch any HBO series, regardless of its huge presence in American culture, because the network has never really offered audio description. Snyder told me he is aware of just one project that HBO made an audio description for \u2014 2009\u2019s \u201cMonica & David,\u201d a documentary about two people with Down syndrome getting married \u2014 because his company did it. He also noted that it was done only because the producer wanted it.\n\nCould you imagine how isolating it must feel to be hanging out with your friends, family or colleagues and not be able to chime in with your \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d theories? Or never being able to fully grasp the cultural significance of \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d or \u201cSex and the City\u201d? Or being blind and not being able to engage with an HBO documentary about being blind?\n\nThe decision to simply not include video description has real-life consequences for those who are blind and have low vision.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people that are unemployed that are blind and vision impaired,\u201d Johnson told me. \u201cAnd they\u2019ll tell you part of the reason is that they feel like they\u2019re socially inept. \u2026 They feel alienated. Why would we do that to anyone?\u201d\n\nFrankly, it\u2019s insulting, ablelist and reinforces the notion in society that people with disabilities are less than those without.\n\nThe network has received pushback from the community for not including video descriptions. There have been petitions and published mentions of this injustice. Yet HBO won\u2019t budge, nor did it offer me any explanation as to why it does not offer audio description when I reached out to the company.\n\nHBO is not legally required to provide audio description, unfortunately. In 2010, Congress passed and President Barack Obama signed, with help from Stevie Wonder, the 21st Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act, a law that requires advanced technology to be accessible to people with disabilities \u2014 and this includes audio descriptions for television and movies. Yet, the CVAA, which is regulated by the Federal Communications Commission, currently requires only nine television channels \u2014 the top four broadcast networks and top five cable channels \u2014 to provide audio description. The current list includes ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC, Discovery, HGTV, History, TBS and USA.\n\nA representative from the FCC told me that HBO\u2019s Nielsen ratings are not high enough for it to be required by law to provide video description.\n\nInterestingly enough, HBO does offer closed captioning, which provides subtitles for those who are deaf or hard of hearing.\n\nThat, to me, is completely confusing. Why would HBO allow some who are disabled to enjoy its shows rather than all disabled people?", "Tap here to turn on desktop notifications to get the news sent straight to you.", "\ufeffMiley Cyrus, who sang lovingly about Malibu, California, on her most recent album, has lost her home in the beachside town to wildfires burning across the state.\n\nThe singer wrote that she is \u201ccompletely devastated\u201d by fires that have killed at least least 31 people and forced thousands to evacuate.

Gillum trailed DeSantis by less than 0.5 of a percentage point, which will require a machine recount of ballots.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) on Sunday urged Scott to recuse himself from the state\u2019s recounts.\n\n\u201cScott should recuse himself immediately,\u201d Schumer said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cHe has a self-interest in jaundicing this election.

Florida accepts ballots from overseas and military voters through Nov. 16 as long as they are postmarked by Election Day.\n\nDespite the Florida governor\u2019s baseless claim that Nelson is \u201ctrying to commit fraud to win this election,\u201d Florida\u2019s Department of State and Department of Law Enforcement have both said they have not received any allegations of fraud.\n\nNelson\u2019s campaign also has a lawsuit. It seeks to force the state to count ballots thrown out because the signature on them didn\u2019t match the one on file with the state\u2019s voter registration.\n\nSen.

Donald Trump, like his friends in Russia, Saudi Arabia and North Korea, is an authoritarian leader who does not believe in democracy.

On Sunday, he listened as he was lectured on the dangers of nationalist isolation, and then he headed home just as the inaugural Paris Peace Summit was getting underway.\n\nBack at the White House on Monday, Trump tweeted that \u201cmuch was accomplished\u201d in his meetings, but voiced a familiar complaint about America\u2019s allies. He said the U.S. pays billions \u201cprotecting other countries, and we get nothing but Trade Deficits and Losses.\u201d He added: \u201cIt is time that these very rich countries either pay the United States for its great military protection, or protect themselves.\u201d\n\nHis France trip made clear that, nearly two years after taking office, Trump has dramatically upended decades of American foreign policy posture, shaking allies. That includes French President Emmanuel Macron, who on Sunday warned that the \u201cancient demons\u201d that caused World War I and millions of deaths were once again making headway.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS French President Emmanuel Macron delivers his speech during ceremonies at the Arc de Triomphe Sunday, Nov. 11, 2018 in Paris. (AP Photo/Francois Mori, Pool)\n\nMacron, who has been urging a re-embrace of multinational organizations and cooperation that have been shunned by Trump, delivered a barely veiled rebuke of Trumpism at the weekend\u2019s centerpiece event: A gathering of dozens of leaders at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at the base of the Arc de Triomphe to mark the passage of a century since the guns fell silent in a global war that killed millions. Bells tolled across Europe\u2019s Western Front and fighter jets passed overhead to mark the exact moment the devastating war came to a close.\n\nWith Trump and other leaders looking on, Macron took on the rising tide of populism in the United States and Europe and urged leaders not to turn their backs by turning inward.\n\n\u201cPatriotism is the exact opposite of nationalism: Nationalism is a betrayal of patriotism,\u201d Macron said, adding that, when nations put their interests first and decide \u201cwho cares about the others\u201d they \u201cerase the most precious thing a nation can have ... its moral values.\u201d\n\nAfter Trump was gone, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who recently announced that she will not be seeking re-election, made an impassioned plea for global cooperation at the peace forum, saying World War I had \u201cmade clear what disastrous consequences a lack of compromise in politics and diplomacy can have.\u201d\n\nTrump, who has made clear that he has limited patience for broad, multilateral agreements, sat mostly stone-faced as he listened to Macron, who sees himself as Europe\u2019s foil to the rising nationalist sentiment, which has taken hold in Hungary and Poland among other countries.\n\nTrump did engage with his fellow leaders, attending a group welcome dinner hosted by Macron at the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay on Saturday night and a lunch on Sunday. He also spent time with Macron on Saturday, when the two stressed their shared desire for more burden-sharing during a quick availability with reporters.\n\nBut Trump was terse during some of his private conversations with world leaders, according to people with direct knowledge of his visit. One of the people described the president as \u201cgrumpy.\u201d They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss private conversations.\n\nBENOIT TESSIER via Getty Images Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau (L), Moroccan King Mohammed VI (3rd L) and his son Crown Prince Hassan Moulay (2nd L), U.S. First Lady Melania Trump (C), U.S. President Donald Trump (3rd R), German Chancellor Angela Merkel (2nd R) and French President Emmanuel Macron attend a ceremony at the Arc de Triomphe in Paris on November 11, 2018 as part of commemorations marking the 100th anniversary of the 11 November 1918 armistice, ending World War I. (BENOIT TESSIER/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe symbolism during Trump\u2019s visit couldn\u2019t have been more stark.\n\nTrump was missing from one of the weekend\u2019s most powerful images: A line of world leaders, walking shoulder to-shoulder in a somber, rain-soaked procession as the bells marking the exact moment that fighting ended \u2014 11 a.m. on Nov. 11, 1918 \u2014 finished tolling.\n\nThe president and first lady Melania Trump had traveled to the commemoration separately \u2014 White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders cited security protocols \u2014 from the other dignitaries, who had traveled together by bus from the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace.\n\nAs Trump\u2019s motorcade was making its solo trip down the grand Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, which was closed to traffic, at least one topless woman breached tight security, running into the street and shouting \u201cfake peace maker\u201d as the cars passed. She had slogans, including the words \u201cFake\u201d and \u201cPeace,\u201d written on her chest.\n\nPolice tackled the woman and the motorcade continued uninterrupted. The feminist activist group Femen later claimed responsibility.\n\nAlso traveling on his own was Russian President Vladimir Putin, who shook Trump\u2019s hand, flashed him a thumbs-up sign and patted Trump\u2019s arm as he arrived. Trump responded with a wide smile.\n\nNational security adviser John Bolton had said at one point that Putin and Trump would meet in Paris, but they will instead hold a formal sit-down later this month at a world leaders\u2019 summit in Buenos Aires. A Kremlin official said later that U.S. and Russian officials decided to drop plans for the Paris meeting after French officials objected.\n\nTrump, who ran on an \u201cAmerica First\u201d platform, has jarred European allies with his actions. He has slapped tariffs on the European Union, pulled the U.S. out of the landmark Paris Climate Accord and the Iran nuclear deal and suggested he might be willing to pull the U.S. out of NATO if member counties don\u2019t significantly boost their defense spending. Trump\u2019s eagerness to get along with the Russian leader \u2014 in spite of Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 election and numerous other aggressive moves in recent years \u2014 has alarmed those who view Russia as a growing threat.\n\nTrump has also repeatedly branded himself a \u201cnationalist,\u201d despite criticism from some that the term has negative connotations. At a news conference last week, Trump defended his use of the phrase. \u201cYou know what the word is? I love our country,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cYou have nationalists. You have globalists. I also love the world and I don\u2019t mind helping the world, but we have to straighten out our country first. We have a lot of problems.\u201d\n\nBut Trump did not broach the divide as he paid tribute Sunday to U.S. and allied soldiers killed in World War I during \u201ca horrible, horrible war\u201d that marked America\u2019s emergence as a world power.\n\n\u201cWe are gathered together at this hallowed resting place to pay tribute to the brave Americans who gave their last breath in that mighty struggle,\u201d Trump said at the Suresnes American Cemetery and Memorial in the suburbs of Paris, where more than 1,500 Americans who died in the war are buried.\n\n\u201cIt is our duty to preserve the civilization they defended and to protect the peace they so nobly gave their lives to secure one century ago,\u201d he said after spending a moment, standing alone amid the cemetery\u2019s white crosses, holding a black umbrella.\n\nThe Veterans Day speech came a day after Trump was criticized for failing to visit a different American cemetery about 60 miles (100 kilometers) outside of Paris on Saturday because rain grounded the helicopter he had planned to take. A handful of senior administration officials, including White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, went in the president\u2019s place, while Trump remained behind at the ambassador\u2019s residence with no alternate schedule for hours.\n\nTrump delivered the speech as other leaders were gathered for the Paris Peace Forum, which aims to revive collective governance and international cooperation to tackle global challenges. Afterward he flew back to Washington.\n\nFrance was the epicenter of World War I, the first global conflict. Its role as host of the main international commemoration highlighted the point that the world mustn\u2019t stumble into war again, as it did so quickly and catastrophically with World War II.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Robert Burns and Julie Pace in Washington and Lori Hinnant and Angela Charlton in Paris contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFor more information on World War I, go to The Associated Press\u2019 WWI hub: https://www.apnews.com/WorldWarI\n\n___", "MONTCLAIR, Calif. (AP) \u2014 A second high school coach of the gunman who killed 12 people at a Southern California bar recalled him on Sunday as volatile and intimidating, and said that repeated complaints to school administrators about his behavior failed to prompt any discipline.\n\nEvie Cluke coached Ian David Long on Newbury Park High School\u2019s track team in 2007 and 2008. In an interview with The Associated Press, she said Long was a \u201cticking time bomb\u201d who constantly lost his temper, threw tantrums and would scream at coaches when he didn\u2019t like their decisions. She said she once witnessed him assault a fellow coach.\n\nThat coach, Dominique Colell, said Long grabbed her rear and midsection after she refused to return a cellphone. Another time, he used his hand to mimic shooting her, Colell said, adding that she feared for herself whenever she was around him.\n\nCluke said she also witnessed Long pretending to shoot Colell.\n\n\u201cWhen Dominique turned around and saw that, she turned pale as a ghost and it was very, very scary.\u201d Cluke said. \u201cJust sadistic. ... He was out of control. He would scream and cuss and his face would turn bright red and people would actually back away from him.\u201d\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Former high school track coach Evie Cluke said Ian David Long was volatile and sadistic and once told her he wanted to join the military so he could kill people for his country.\n\nLong, a 28-year-old former Marine machine-gunner who served in Afghanistan, opened fire during college night at the Borderline Bar and Grill in Thousand Oaks on Wednesday night. He killed 11 people and a police officer who responded, and then fatally shot himself, police said.\n\nAuthorities have not determined a motive.\n\nColell kicked Long off the track team immediately after he assaulted her, but she and Cluke said the boy\u2019s track coach urged her to reconsider because that could compromise Long\u2019s goal of joining the Marines. The head track coach, Cluke said, reversed Colell\u2019s decision to throw Long off the team and told her she didn\u2019t have that authority, while the now-retired principal brushed it aside as a one-time incident.\n\nLong rejoined the team after apologizing in front of several coaches and administrators.\n\nCluke said she, Colell, and her father, also a track coach at the school at the time, repeatedly reported Long\u2019s behavioral problems, to no avail.\n\n\u201cYou need to do something about this kid. He needs some help.\u201d Cluke said she told administrators. \u201cAnd they\u2019re like, \u2018Well, he\u2019s got a good heart he\u2019ll be fine. Just talk to him.\u2019\u201d\n\nEmails to various administrators at the high school were not immediately answered Sunday. Attempts to get comment by phone and in person from officials at the school and its district were unsuccessful Friday, when both were closed because of a massive and deadly wildfire in the area.\n\nCluke recalled a time when she and her father sat down with Long for a talk and asked him why he wanted to join the military. His answer, she said, \u201cis burned in my soul.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe said he wanted to be in the Marines because he wanted to go fight in the war for our country and he wanted to kill for our country,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you hear somebody say they want to be in the military because they want to kill people in the name of our country, that\u2019s chilling. It chilled me right down to my bones.\u201d\n\nShe said it\u2019s time for school administrators across the country to take behavioral problems seriously.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the military or video games or music that causes this,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s the inaction of people in authority.\u201d\n\nShe said that if other coaches and school administrators had acted following complaints about Long, \u201che could\u2019ve gotten help and 12 innocent people wouldn\u2019t be dead now.\u201d", "Two years ago, I was in charge of organizing the front of house at New York\u2019s Javits Center for Hillary Clinton\u2019s election night. By 10 p.m., the 52 young people working for me all gathered in the basement to shed tears and exchange fearful predictions of what the future would hold.\n\nThat night set into motion a chain of events that awakened an entire generation of activists to our obligations as stewards of this world. Women and young people started the Women\u2019s March and led organizations like Swing Left, Indivisible and Flippable to fill in where the Democratic National Committee was conspicuously absent.\n\nThe most remarkable changes in human history have come when a generation of young people decides that the circumstances they inherited are no longer acceptable to them and therefore it\u2019s upon them to change those circumstances. Many of our Founding Fathers were under 30 in 1776, and the civil rights movement that rose in the 1950s was fueled by students and led by a reverend in his mid-20s.\n\nThis moment seems to be the beginning of one of those periods.\n\nThis generation is not entitled, selfish or lazy. We are disappointed.\n\nThroughout the year we\u2019ve seen the foreshadowing of Tuesday\u2019s result. Run for Something reported a record 600 to 700 millennials were running in state legislative races and more than 200 ran for Congress this cycle.\n\nEven before the midterm elections, Democratic primaries saw a surge in young voters and young candidates. Huge wins by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ayanna Pressley were propelled by young people, and my primary loss in New York\u2019s 12th Congressional District saw a remarkable 797 percent increase in 18-to-35-year-old turnout compared with 2016.\n\nYoung people are coming out in such strong support of other young people running for office because young candidates tend to talk about the future. And there\u2019s a trust that they will be seen by their representatives in a way they haven\u2019t before. We live a shared experience, and there\u2019s a deep connection felt between people with such diverse backgrounds. It\u2019s why this group of Democratic candidates was far and away one of the most diverse in the history of the country.\n\nWe are disappointed in the future we\u2019ve been given, but we\u2019re activated with the knowledge that we have the power to change it.\n\nThe last two years of activism and wins have proved that this generation is not entitled, nor is it selfish or lazy. Instead, we are disappointed. We are disappointed with inheriting $20 trillion in debt and an additional $1.5 trillion in student debt, stagnant wages, a warming planet and a heartless waste of so much human potential when our prisons are overfilled (primarily with people of color) and immigrants live in the shadows.\n\nThese problems were not created overnight, and most of their root causes have been ignored through both Republican and Democratic periods of governance. Elections and politics should be about the future \u2015 the laws we make today affect the next generation, but our politics have been more concerned with recriminations about the past or divisions in the present.\n\nOn climate change and gun control, mass incarceration and immigration, we have been let down by both Republican and Democratic congresses over the past two decades. It\u2019s not about ideology, it\u2019s about problem-solving, and we know our politics has failed to deliver.\n\nThis is a generational problem, but Tuesday night\u2019s results empower us with hope because we have agency to change our future.\n\nAnd the changes we seek are not so different from any other generation of reformers. This generation owes it to our parents, our children and ourselves to continue advancing\u2014not just to protect our democracy and institutions from current threats but also to ensure that we are equipped as a society for the future.\n\nTo make sure that everyone has access to a quality education. To end systemic oppression against entire communities. To stand with science and fact, regardless of where that might lead or how uncomfortable the truth may make us. This obligation is as old as history, but today\u2019s circumstances are unique.\n\nLast Tuesday, we helped power Democrats into the majority for the 116th Congress. The die is now cast. If the Democratic Party wants to hold its gains, it needs to believe in young people, give them the opportunity to lead, engage them where they are and focus on the significant intergenerational justice issues that matter most: climate change, mass incarceration, immigration, gun control, economic growth and inequality.\n\nWe are disappointed in the future we\u2019ve been given, but we\u2019re activated with the knowledge that we have the power to change it.", "\u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d cast members, and the rappers Lil Wayne and Future, hunt booty \u2014 but with \u201crespect\u201d \u2014 in a quirky spoof music video.\n\nThe vid \u2014 called \u201cPermission\u201d \u2014 combines a wacky full-on babe stalk with a sensitivity about women.\n\n\u201cSNL\u2019s\u201d Kenan Thompson and Chris Redd play the Booty Kings, a fictional rap duo performing a standard kind of hip-hop booty anthem at a club \u2014 but with a new riff.\n\n\u201cTimes have changed\u201d (yo), they rap. \u201cWe on some new respectful shit.\u201d\n\nThe song includes lyrics like, \u201cShake that booty \u2026 If you wanna,\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m on a mission for that ass but first I need permission.\u201c Thompson poses reading a book called Being a Booty Ally.\n\nWayne raps: \u201cRespect the ladies so I treat ya like an equal/Got me starin\u2019 at that booty like an eagle.\u201d\n\nAlso on \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d Wayne performed \u201cCan\u2019t Be Broken\u201d with Halsey, and \u201cUproar\u201d with Swizz Beatz.", "The three wildfires raging on both ends of California have exacted a staggering toll.

Contrary to popular belief, marine plastic debris does not simply cluster in large floating patches. In fact, only a tiny amount of the plastic in the seas drifts on the surface. So, where\u2019s the rest of it?\n\n\u201cWe really don\u2019t know where most of the plastic is ending up in the ocean,\u201d said Kara Lavender Law, an ocean plastic scientist at Sea Education Association in Woods Hole, Massachusetts.\n\nDecades of surveying the oceans have found only a quarter of a million metric tons of floating plastic debris worldwide, whereas in 2015, Law and collaborators estimated that between 4 and 12 million metric tons of plastics were moving from land to the coasts and oceans each year.\n\n\u201cWe can account for somewhere between 1 and 3 percent of the plastics coming in from land in a single year,\u201d Law says.\n\nThe missing plastic could have met any one of four possible fates, and most scientists agree that the lion\u2019s share is likely dispersed throughout the deep ocean and sitting on the seafloor.\n\n\u201cThe mythology of islands of plastic, these garbage patches, has led the public to really misunderstand where plastic is in the world,\u201d said Marcus Eriksen, co-founder of the nonprofit Five Gyres Institute. While ocean currents do indeed cause refuse to amass in certain areas \u2015 like the Great Pacific Garbage Patch \u2015 Eriksen described the majority of ocean plastic as a kind of smog: billions of tiny particles called microplastics, some too small to see with the naked eye.\n\nCORRECTION: A previous version of this story stated that Kara Lavender Law is affiliated with the Wood Hole Oceanographic Institution. In fact, she works with the Sea Education Association in Woods Hole, Massachusetts.\n\nPlastics are not as hardy as commonly believed \u2015 they degrade even when lovingly cared for in a museum. Out in the oceans and on the beaches, waves physically break plastics into pieces, which can linger in the environment for years.\n\nMicroorganisms can cling to the small plastic pieces and drag them down from the surface. The tiniest fragments can be ingested by filter feeders and then excreted as poop, sinking to the bottom of the ocean. \u201cThe first hundred meters of the ocean surface gets cycled through marine life, and it\u2019s washed by the intestines of organisms,\u201d Eriksen said.\n\nA 2014 study found tiny bits of plastic in sediment and coral samples collected from 16 locations in the Mediterranean Sea, Indian Ocean and the North Atlantic Ocean.\n\nAnother possibility is that some of the missing plastics are simply washing up on beaches and coasts. Around the world, island nations in the Pacific and remote beaches along the coast of Alaska are the depositories for plastic debris that has traveled thousands of miles.\n\nA smaller fraction of the missing plastic could be trapped inside of animals. There\u2019s the all-too-familiar story of plastic pieces clogging up animal guts. Scientists have also captured zooplankton \u2015 microscopic critters at the bottom of the food chain \u2015 eating microplastics. That means plastics could be traveling from animal to animal throughout the marine food web.\n\nSarah Jeanne-Royer Sarah-Jeanne Royer stands atop a mound of plastic debris. Earlier this year, she found that ocean plastics can decay into greenhouse gases.\n\nAnd to a lesser extent, the plastics\u2019 polymer strands could be breaking down into small molecules through chemical reactions triggered by sunlight. This summer, Sarah-Jeanne Royer from the University of Hawaii found plastic debris submerged in seawater and exposed to sunlight decaying into greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, methane and ethylene. Once activated, the degradation continues even in the dark.\n\n\u201cGreenhouse gas production from plastic is another sink that previously wasn\u2019t taken into account,\u201d Royer said.\n\nWhile it is unclear how much of the plastics have turned into gases and how much of those gases escape to the atmosphere or stay sequestered in the oceans, this could constitute a significant but unmeasured source of greenhouse gas emissions, she said.\n\nFor the most part, the mystery of the missing ocean plastic can be blamed on a lack of data. Most surveys for plastic are conducted at the ocean surface using nets designed to study plankton, Law said. Seafloors and each ocean\u2019s water column, on the other hand, are much less studied.\n\n\u201cIt gets deep very quickly and it\u2019s very hard to go into that environment and to make comprehensive measurements,\u201d she said.\n\nThough more attention is being paid to the seafloor and the sediments these days, there are thousands of meters of water in-between that are difficult to survey.\n\n\u201cYou look at the surface and you look at the bottom, but you\u2019re still missing most of it because the ocean is deep,\u201d Royer said. \u201cAt the moment with plastic pollution, what we are missing is a better technology.\u201d\n\nA 7th grader has taken a stab at creating such technology. Anna Du at the Andover School of Montessori in Massachusetts built an underwater remote-operated-vehicle (ROV) to look for microplastics dispersed throughout oceans.\n\nAnna Du Anna Du and her plastic-hunting ROV.\n\nDu built her ROV from PVC pipes that she saved from her home\u2019s renovation. The ROV can move up and down, left and right, and forward and backward in the water column. A camera helps Du guide it. A detection system attached to the bottom of the ROV takes photographs of the materials that it encounters. Du is currently training a computer program to recognize what is plastic and what is not.\n\nOn the coasts, even though beach cleanups have occurred for decades, it is very difficult to scientifically quantify the amount of plastics collected.\n\n\u201cThe challenge is that, especially with beach cleanups, you really need everybody to be following the same protocol in order to be able to compare data,\u201d Law said.\n\nTo help, Eriksen is working on a global set of methods for volunteers to follow. That includes how to measure a starting and ending point on a beach, and how to count and classify debris.\n\n\u201cThis is where citizen science comes into play,\u201d he said.\n\nLubo Ivanko via Getty Images\n\nDuring the search for missing plastic, the bigger picture should be kept in mind \u2015 which is to prevent plastic from escaping into the environment, said George Leonard, an Ocean Conservancy scientist.\n\n\u201cWhile I think there\u2019s an academic interest in where this stuff resides, the fact that we\u2019re now finding it everywhere suggests that first and foremost we\u2019ve got to keep it out of the oceans in the first place,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cCleaning up the oceans really isn\u2019t the solution to this problem.\u201d", "Former first lady Michelle Obama has revealed that she \u201cstopped even trying to smile\u201d during the 2017 inauguration of President Donald Trump in an interview with ABC that aired Sunday night.\n\nReading from her forthcoming memoir, Becoming, Obama said that the \u201cvibrant diversity\u201d of her husband\u2019s two previous inaugurations \u201cwas gone\u201d on the day Trump took office.\n\n\u201cSomeone from Barack\u2019s administration might have said that the optics were bad \u2015 that what the public saw didn\u2019t reflect the president\u2019s reality or ideals,\u201d she said. \u201cBut in this case, maybe it did.

He was 90.\n\nHis death was announced in a news release from the Stratford Festival, a repertory theater festival in Canada. Rain was one of the founders of the festival.\n\nAlthough Rain was active in theater and television throughout his career, he is best known for providing the voice of the sentient computer HAL 9000 in the movies \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey\u201d and \u201c2010: The Year We Made Contact.\u201d Although HAL becomes an antagonist for the astronauts on the Discovery One spacecraft, the voice maintains an eerily calm tone \u2013 especially when it delivers the iconic line \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Dave, I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t do that.\u201d\n\nRain had not been Kubrick\u2019s first choice for HAL, The New York Times said in March. Oscar-winning actor Martin Balsam had recorded the part with the full range of human emotions, even crying at one point.\n\nThen Kubrick had a change of heart and turned to Rain, whose voice he had heard as the narrator of a 1960 documentary titled \u201cUniverse.\u201d Rain told The Times that Kubrick had said to him: \u201cI\u2019m having trouble with what I\u2019ve got in the can. Would you play the computer?\u201d\n\nRain met none of the other actors on the film, recording his part in a studio at the MGM lot in Borehamwood, outside London. All the other members of the cast had already completed filming.\n\n\u201cIf you could have been a ghost at the recording you would have thought it was a load of rubbish,\u201d Rain said.\n\nNow, half a decade later, the tone and cadence of Rain\u2019s voice seems to have served as the model for automated voices, like Apple\u2019s Siri and Amazon Echo\u2019s Alexa.\n\nTerry Manzo Douglas Rain\n\nBorn in Winnipeg in 1928, to James and Mary Rain, he was a child actor on CBC radio. He attended the University of Manitoba then studied at the Old Vic theater school in London. Rain returned to Canada for the Stratford Festival\u2019s inaugural season in 1953, playing the Marquis of Dorset and Tyrrell in Shakespeare\u2019s Richard III.\n\nRain spent 32 seasons at the Stratford Festival playing roles in many Shakespearean productions, including Tyrone Guthrie\u2019s renowned production of Oedipus Rex, which was filmed and released worldwide.\n\n\u201cDouglas Rain was that rare artist: an actor deeply admired by other actors,\u201d said the festival\u2019s artistic director Antoni Cimolino. \u201cThe voice of HAL in \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey,\u201d Douglas shared many of the same qualities as Kubrick\u2019s iconic creation: precision, strength of steel, enigma and infinite intelligence, as well as a wicked sense of humor. But those of us lucky enough to have worked with Douglas soon solved his riddle and discovered that at the centre of his mystery lay warmth and humanity, evidenced in his care for the young members of our profession.\u201d\n\nJeff Goode via Getty Images Douglas Rain in a 1998 photo.\n\nRain also appeared on Broadway several times and received a Tony Award nomination as best featured actor in a play for the 1972 production of Vivat!

HuffPost reached out to Hamill and AMC and we\u2019ve yet to receive a reply. But with so many unrequited tweeters wondering did he or didn\u2019t he, we decided to voluntarily fall, not unlike Rey in \u201cThe Last Jedi,\u201d down a dark rabbit hole of truth. And what we found has to be shared with the world \u2015 nay, the galaxy here and far, far away.\n\nBreak out your lightsabers and put on your tinfoil hats.\n\nWas Mark Hamill secretly in \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d?\n\nIt went down like this: On the Nov. 4 episode of \u201cWalking Dead,\u201d Jadis (Pollyanna McIntosh) arranged for an injured Rick Grimes to be transported away by helicopter, a move that is likely meant to set up AMC\u2019s Rick Grimes movie universe. Jadis communicates with someone on the helicopter via walkie talkie. Following the episode, a bunch of fans pointed out online that the person she\u2019s talking to sounds an awful lot like Mark Hamill.\n\nAnd it does sound like him.\n\nJust listen:\n\nWhy dive any deeper? It\u2019s obviously Mark Hamill, right?\n\nThe \u201cStar Wars\u201d actor does a lot of voice over work, regularly taking his talents to movies and TV, notably giving us the iconic voice of the animated Joker. Beyond his cartoonish voices, though, his day-to-day speaking voice is very distinctive, which is why so many fans are convinced the person speaking in the clip above is Hamill himself.\n\nCall me crazy, but I could swear @HamillHimself (Mark Hamill) did the voice on the other end of the Jadis junkyard walkie scene. @WalkingDead_AMC #AorB #WalkingDead That would be so awesome!! \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffc \u2014 Joser (@jsv311) October 23, 2018\n\nThe helicopter voice sounds so similar to Hamill\u2019s that people guessed the actor made an appearance weeks ago, back when the show first featured the voice on the walkie-talkie (in the third episode of Season 9), after Jadis called the chopper up from the junkyard to make sure its occupants weren\u2019t killing Saviors.\n\nBut why would Hamill guest star on the show?\n\nThe \u201cWalking Dead\u201d producers loooove \u201cStar Wars.\u201d\n\nI mean this with the utmost of respect: The people behind \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d are a bunch of \u201cStar Wars\u201d nerds.\n\nIn an interview last week, showrunner Angela Kang told HuffPost about the casting of \u201cStar Wars\u201d actress Fleming, explaining \u2014 like we said \u2014 that the producers sincerely worship George Lucas\u2019 space opera.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a huge \u2018Star Wars\u2019 universe fan, as is [creative content officer Scott Gimple], as are a lot of people on our show. So that was very exciting for us to have little Rey on our show,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd hey, it makes sense to involve Hamill in the show now, potentially establishing him as part of the upcoming expanded universe of movies, since the helicopter group will obviously be involved.\n\nMay the Like be with you.\n\nTwitter Screenshot/HuffPost created GIF A Rey of hope?\n\nMaybe Hamill just innocently liked this random tweet from a fan about Fleming\u2019s role in \u201cWalking Dead.\u201d Maybe. He is tagged in the tweet, so he could just be showing support for his franchise colleague.\n\nBut let\u2019s take a second. Fleming\u2019s role in \u201cForce Awakens\u201d happened in a flashback; it was even briefer than Hamill\u2019s own famously wordless appearance. If I were to guess whether they were BFFs or they hardly know each other, I\u2019d bet the latter. Would it make more sense that he liked this tweet because he knew Fleming would be taking on this role in advance... because he\u2019s in the episode too?\n\nCameo conspiracies aside, \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d came out swinging in the first episode of the post-Rick era, introducing us to the talking zombies, aka the Whisperers, a group of living people who wear the skin of the undead.\n\nPlus, we learned Carol (Melissa McBride), who\u2019s gone all Katniss Everdeen, covered a bunch of rogue Saviors in fuel and lit them on fire. Oh, and it turns out the theories were right about Michonne (Danai Gurira) being pregnant with little Richonne: she now has a little boy named RJ. (Uh, Rick Jr.? Wait. Richonne Jr.?)\n\nThere was also a lot of Fleming, who is growing closer to Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), filling in a storyline from the comics that the show seemed to abandon after the death of Carl (Chandler Riggs).", "First Amendment expert Floyd Abrams said Sunday that CNN \u201cshould sue\u201d the White House for revoking the press credentials of correspondent Jim Acosta.\n\nIt would be a \u201creally strong lawsuit,\u201d the attorney told Brian Stelter on CNN\u2019s \u201cReliable Sources.\u201d Abrams referred to a case in which the White House revoked credentials in the 1970s. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled then that the White House must provide notice in such a case, as well as an opportunity for a journalist to respond and a written opinion from the White House explaining its reasoning that a court can examine.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had none of those things here,\u201d Abrams explained.\n\n\u201cI can understand CNN being reluctant to sue because the president keeps saying CNN is the enemy of me, and CNN might have some reluctance to have a lawsuit titled CNN v. Donald Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cThat said, yes, I think they should sue.\u201d\n\nAbrams is one of the foremost experts on the First Amendment and has argued several cases on free speech rights before the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cThis is going to happen again,\u201d Abrams warned about the White House revoking press credentials. \u201cSo whether it\u2019s CNN suing or the next company suing, someone is going to have to bring a lawsuit.

He said the president\u2019s decision to yank Acosta\u2019s credentials is \u201cnot only wrong and unfair; it\u2019s dangerous for the press as a whole.\u201d\n\nA CNN spokesperson told HuffPost that \u201cno decisions have been made\u201d on whether to file a lawsuit. \u201cWe have reached out to the White House and have gotten no response,\u201d the spokesperson added.\n\nEarlier, a CNN statement said that the Trump administration\u2019s treatment of Acosta was \u201cretaliation\u201d for coverage of Donald Trump that the president does not like.\n\nAcosta\u2019s White House credentials were revoked last week after a furious Trump refused to answer a follow-up question from Acosta at a press conference, told the journalist \u201cthat\u2019s enough\u201d and called him a \u201cterrible person.\u201d\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders justified the decision by saying Acosta had \u201cput his hands on\u201d an intern as she tried to grab for the microphone the journalist was holding, which Acosta denied. Video of the event appears to show Acosta accidentally grazing the intern\u2019s arm as he gesticulates toward Trump. Acosta immediately apologized, saying, \u201cPardon me, ma\u2019am.\u201d\n\nA video apparently doctored by a contributor to the right-wing conspiracy website Infowars was posted by Sanders on Twitter as \u201cevidence\u201d of her claim. The clip speeds up Acosta\u2019s hand gesture, making it appear forceful. Top White House adviser Kellyanne Conway confirmed Sunday that the video was \u201csped up,\u201d saying that such altering is \u201cdone all the time\u201d on sports programs.\n\nAcosta\u2019s \u201cpardon me\u201d was not included in the White House version of the video.\n\nAt the press conference, Acosta first asked the president why he thought the caravan of migrants heading north through Mexico to the U.S. border was an \u201cinvasion.\u201d Trump responded that it\u2019s an invasion \u201cbecause I consider it an invasion.\u201d", "I began my service to country in a war, a bitter war that frayed and nearly shredded the fabric of America.

If that doesn\u2019t make you an optimist, nothing will.", "The race to count Florida\u2019s votes got even messier on Sunday as Gov. Rick Scott\u2019s campaign filed a handful of lawsuits seeking to give law enforcement custody of election equipment and prevent certain ballots from being included in official results.\n\nA recount began Saturday in the U.S. Senate race between Scott, a Republican, and Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson. Scott narrowly leads Nelson by about 0.15 percentage points, well within the state\u2019s 0.25 percent threshold for a manual recount.\n\nScott accused Brenda Snipes, the supervisor of elections in Broward County, of violating state law by refusing to provide information to his campaign about the number of outstanding ballots. He also alleged Susan Bucher, the supervisor of elections in Palm Beach County, had run afoul of state law by duplicating and damaging certain ballots. He asked a state judge to authorize law enforcement officials to \u201cimpound and secure\u201d all voting equipment when it wasn\u2019t in use for the recounts or other election-related activity. He also asked the judge to require both officials to preserve all ballots related to the 2018 elections.\n\nIn a separate suit against Snipes, Scott\u2019s campaign asked a judge to block Broward County from counting any of the ballots it didn\u2019t include in the unofficial results it submitted to the Florida Department of State by noon Saturday, a deadline set by state law. That request, if granted, could mean some valid ballots would not be counted. Florida accepts vote-by-mail ballots until 7 p.m. on Election Day and the county may not have them all counted by Saturday\u2019s deadline.\n\nReuters Florida Gov. Rick Scott, who is running for U.S. Senate, filed multiple lawsuits Sunday regarding the election.\n\nThe populous and heavily Democratic Broward County is a key area for Nelson if he is to overcome Scott\u2019s lead. In a Sunday statement, Nelson\u2019s campaign accused Scott of trying to stop valid votes from being counted.\n\n\u201cIf Rick Scott wanted to make sure every legal ballot is counted, he would not be suing to try and stop voters from having their legal ballot counted as intended,\u201d the campaign said in a statement. \u201cHe\u2019s doing this for the same reason he\u2019s been making false and panicked claims about voter fraud \u2015 he\u2019s worried that when all the votes are counted he\u2019ll lose this election. We will not allow him to undermine the democratic process and will use every legal tool available to protect the rights of Florida voters.\u201d\n\nFlorida Democratic Party Executive Director Juan Pe\u00f1alosa said in a statement that Scott was \u201cusing his position to consolidate power by cutting at the very core of our Democracy.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn suing to seize ballots and impound voting machines, Rick Scott is doing his best to impersonate Latin American dictators who have overthrown Democracies in Venezuela and Cuba,\u201d Pe\u00f1alosa said.\n\nThere are also recounts underway in statewide contests for governor and state agriculture commissioner. Bucher, the Palm Beach County election official, told CNN it would be \u201cimpossible\u201d for her staff to meet the state\u2019s deadline for recounting the votes.\n\nSarah Revell, a spokeswoman for the Florida Secretary of State\u2019s Office, told the network that if a county can\u2019t meet the deadline \u201cthen the results on file at that time take their place.\u201d The chair of the Palm Beach Republican Party told CNN that would be good news for Republicans because GOP candidates are currently leading.\n\nNelson\u2019s campaign also has a lawsuit seeking to force the state to count ballots thrown out because the signature on them didn\u2019t match the one on file with the state\u2019s voter registration. Federal judges in Georgia and New Hampshire have blocked similar laws in those states this year.", "The country is said to be as divided as ever along political party lines. But there are things that can bring us together: stuff we all hate.\n\nOn this weekend\u2019s \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d the cast got together for a singalong where, in the face of political division, they run through a list of things that we as human beings can all agree are terrible. From the words \u201cmoist\u201d and \u201ccrotch\u201d to bees that follow you around and people who say \u201cthe book was better.\u201d", "Perhaps the most alarming \u2015 if not exactly surprising \u2015 fallout from last Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections was President Donald Trump\u2019s immediate dismissal of his long-beleaguered attorney general, Jeff Sessions, and the subsequent appointment of Matthew Whitaker, a Trump toady and Sessions\u2019 chief of staff, as his acting replacement. If the firing was, in part, an attempt to commandeer the nation\u2019s post-election attention, it worked.\n\nMuch has been said and written already about the one-two punch of Sessions\u2019 firing and his immediate replacement by a plainly unqualified staffer who had been secretly (or, as it turns out, not so secretly) spying on the attorney general on behalf of the White House. But some of what\u2019s been said is wrong, and the parts that are right will no doubt need bolstering against inevitable withering attack, so a bit more still needs to be said.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: Trump fired Sessions for doing the one unquestionably ethical and decent thing in his tenure as attorney general \u2015 recusing himself from the investigation of Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign, including contacts with Russia, of which he was an integral part. Although the nation is still waiting for many of the shoes from that investigation to drop, we have already seen, in 18 months, a remarkable 35 indictments, six guilty pleas, and eight jury convictions. Whitaker, who has been critical of the probe led by special counsel Robert Mueller, now oversees that investigation, as well as the FBI and all 93 U.S. attorneys. And he may do so until next June.\n\nTrump has been told repeatedly, by members of his own party, that sacking Sessions and otherwise threatening Mueller could cost him his presidency. Yet he has done just that.\n\nOver months of using cable television appearances to audition for the role, Whitaker has nurtured the president\u2019s expectation that he can and will refuse to recuse himself from oversight of Mueller\u2019s investigation, and will indeed shield Trump and his family from any consequences of that investigation, including being held accountable for legal violations that carry the risk of serious jail time and removal from office. One can imagine no reason for Trump\u2019s appointment of Whitaker other than the hope of such illegitimate protection.\n\nSo the key question is whether, as most legal scholars appear to agree, Whitaker\u2019s installation is indeed unlawful \u2015 and, if it is, whether the illegality is so clear and significant that no court could credibly hold otherwise.\n\nJIM WATSON via Getty Images\n\nWhether Whitaker\u2019s appointment is legal isn\u2019t just an academic question \u2015 there are real-world scenarios that will force a court to find that it is not. As things stand, individuals charged with federal crimes by Whitaker\u2019s Justice Department could move to dismiss charges against them. If the attorney general \u2015 whose signature appears on the charging documents \u2015 is effectively an impostor, then the office has no legal authority. And the Supreme Court has a history of setting aside official actions that flow from invalid appointments.\n\nSo, if a defendant can show that Whitaker\u2019s authorization is behind a case, and that there\u2019s a serious question about whether Whitaker was legally appointed, courts will have a hard time allowing that case to go forward. Criminal defendants in federal prosecutions could resist whatever the Justice Department demands of them (for instance, by subpoena) by arguing that Whitaker is a legal nobody. Ironically, the only defendant who would find it impossible to use that argument is the man who appointed Whitaker, Donald J. Trump \u2015 in the event he were to be subpoenaed or indicted pursuant to Whitaker\u2019s approval.\n\nIn addition, individual senators could argue that Whitaker\u2019s appointment robs the institutional power conferred on them by the Constitution. The Appointments Clause of Article II charges the Senate with providing \u201cadvice and consent\u201d on the appointment of certain officers, including the attorney general. But Whitaker\u2019s appointment bypassed Senate confirmation, effectively nullifying the power of the Senate and its members to offer advice and consent. Senators could therefore affirmatively sue over the loss of this essential power.\n\nWhen courts do consider the merits of Whitaker\u2019s appointment, they\u2019ll find that it stands on shaky legal ground.\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and others did exactly that when they sued Trump, so far successfully, for accepting foreign government money without congressional permission, which is required by the Constitution\u2019s Foreign Emoluments Clause. It helps that, in that case, the court pointedly noted that the advice and consent provision of Article II is the only constitutional provision similar to the Emoluments Clause\u2019s congressional-consent requirement.\n\nOpponents might point out that if legislators are unhappy, they have a more appropriate available remedy than a court challenge \u2015 they can pass a law. This objection, which the court in the emoluments case called \u201cirrelevant,\u201d is especially inapposite here, because the Senate already did pass a law, the Attorney General Succession Act.\n\nThat statute created a line of succession for the position of attorney general, which would require the position to be filled in this case by the sitting deputy, Rod Rosenstein. It\u2019s hard to imagine what legislative action could be clearer, unless the Senate is expected to pass the law again, now with the added words \u201cand this time we really mean it.\u201d\n\nAlternatively, Mueller or Rosenstein could invoke the illegality of Whitaker\u2019s appointment to justify refusing to follow an order from him. Any of these paths will prompt the judicial branch to exercise the reviewing role it\u2019s held since Marbury v. Madison \u2013 even if, as we have learned, Whitaker may not recognize the legitimacy of that role.\n\nWhen courts do consider the merits of Whitaker\u2019s appointment, they\u2019ll find that it stands on shaky legal ground.\n\nFirst, although Trump may not have uttered to Sessions the words that made him famous on TV (\u201cYou\u2019re fired!\u201d), it\u2019s clear that he did, in fact, fire Sessions. While the attorney general may not have departed under literal threat, he was left with no real choice if he wanted to preserve any dignity. Sessions\u2019 undated resignation letter indicated that he was leaving at the president\u2019s \u201crequest.\u201d When, on Wednesday, Sessions asked if he could stay through the end of the week, he was told to clear out that very day. That sure looks like a firing.\n\nThis matters because of the Vacancies Reform Act, designed to improve the operations of the federal bureaucracy. For the purposes of the VRA, \u201cvacancies\u201d aren\u2019t created by firing. So if a court were to conclude that Sessions actually \u201cresigned,\u201d then Trump and Whitaker could argue that, because of the VRA, anyone working for the Department of Justice could fill the vacancy for up to seven months (210 days). This argument relies on a 2007 opinion of the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel that concluded \u2015 wrongly, in my opinion \u2015 that the Attorney General Succession Act is trumped (if you will) by the VRA, a more recent and far more general statute.\n\nYet even if a court were to agree both that Sessions resigned and that the VRA applies (hardly implausible, in our increasingly pro-presidential judiciary), any federal court will recognize that the Constitution trumps all. And that\u2019s where the big guns get introduced.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nThe Constitution in Article II permits Congress to empower \u201cthe President alone\u201d to appoint \u201cinferior Officers.\u201d All other \u201cOfficers of the United States\u201d \u2015 known as \u201cprincipal officers\u201d \u2015 must be appointed \u201cby and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a good bit of formalism in the business of deciding who\u2019s a principal officer in need of Senate confirmation and who isn\u2019t. Our history establishes that the importance of the office, taken alone, doesn\u2019t determine whether its occupant is a \u201cprincipal officer.\u201d\n\nThe office of chief of staff to the president, for example, has greater influence than, say, the secretary of agriculture (whose office is, in fact way more significant than most people realize), but the office of chief of staff has always been understood as not requiring Senate confirmation. Indeed, the role that Whitaker himself seemed to be playing as the chief of staff to Sessions may have been a bigger deal, influence-wise, than, say, Ben Carson\u2019s position as head of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. But nothing in the Constitution required that Whitaker receive Senate confirmation for that role \u2015 and so he didn\u2019t.\n\nThe attorney general, however, is a principal officer entitled to Senate confirmation \u2015 as even those defending the legality of Whitaker\u2019s appointment agree. But Whitaker was never confirmed by the Senate to his new post, nor to any position in the line of succession to that role, or even to any position with similar responsibilities (the idea that his 2004 confirmation as a U.S. attorney in Iowa would apply at this date and for this position is laughable).\n\nSo how is this not an open-and-shut case? Whitaker\u2019s defenders argue that the president may appoint someone to carry out the attorney general\u2019s duties, without Senate confirmation, so long as the appointment is temporary.\n\nBut, of course, all presidentially appointed officers have time-limited terms: their commissions expire when the term of the president who appointed them ends (after 1,461 days). So being time-limited \u2013 Whitaker serves, as we\u2019ve noted, for at most 210 days \u2013 can\u2019t in itself erase the need for Senate confirmation. And the irreversible damage an acting AG Whitaker could do in 210 days \u2015 to the Mueller probe and to the nation \u2015 is enormous, making entirely implausible any argument that his appointment lacks the gravity that ultimately marks whether Senate confirmation is required.\n\nThose who think Whitaker\u2019s temporary appointment is constitutional \u2015 a group that will undoubtedly include the president\u2019s lawyers and those representing Whitaker \u2015 rely on U.S. v. Eaton, an 1898 Supreme Court case involving a consular position in Bangkok.\n\nConsul Sempronius Boyd, believing himself to be fatally ill, deputized a local missionary as vice-consul to Siam while he awaited the arrival of a Senate-appointed successor by boat. In the exigent circumstances, the Supreme Court found that an \u201cemergency appointment\u201d was justified. It stretches the imagination to suggest that even the most pro-presidential (or pro-Trump) court \u2015 including, as some have suggested, the current Supreme Court \u2015 would buy the analogy.", "Jaime Sloan can seemingly do anything.

Trans women are a fantasy and you don't deserve them. \u2014 Mike Ferlita (@MkFerlita) November 11, 2018", "I visit my pain doctor on a monthly basis. Sometimes I get trigger point injections \u2015 shots of lidocaine into my muscles to stop them from spasming, a frequent occurrence due to my degenerative collagen disorder. Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome also causes my joints to frequently dislocate, randomly and without warning, causing severe and constant pain.\n\nBut the main reason I make this 40-minute drive every month is to pick up a paper prescription for my pain meds; they\u2019re considered a controlled substance, so the law forbids me from refilling them digitally. And every time I make the trip, I\u2019m reminded that even the medical world isn\u2019t designed for sick people like me.\n\nIt starts when I pull into the parking lot and decide to leave my wheelchair in the car, even though I\u2019d obviously rather use it. It doesn\u2019t matter whether my hips are dislocated that day or not; I never use my wheelchair here.\n\nThe building has an elevator I can take to the second-floor office, but it shudders and judders the whole way up, so I use the stairs. I\u2019m then met with two heavy glass doors, and if I were sitting in my chair, the handles would be too high to reach, the doors too heavy to hold. The fact there isn\u2019t an automatic door opener here has always struck me as strange.\n\nIn the waiting room, there\u2019s no space to park myself when seated in my wheelchair; I\u2019d end up inevitably being tripped on. Plus, the doorway between the waiting room and exam rooms is so narrow that wheeling through would be an impossibility (and no automatic door openers here, either). The exam tables aren\u2019t equipped to motor down to my level, which means I\u2019d have to stand up out of my chair to clamber onto the table. The entire experience would be an effort in exhaustion and inaccessibility, so I tough it out on foot instead.\n\nIn many ways, I\u2019m fortunate I can decide to leave my wheelchair in the car, because a depressingly high level of inaccessibility has become the norm when it comes to 21st century medicine. As a partially ambulatory disabled patient with a host of chronic health conditions, I regularly run into what feels like a never-ending gamut of issues every time I visit one of my practitioners. And I\u2019m far from the exception to the rule.\n\nI\u2019m fortunate I can decide to leave my wheelchair in the car, because a depressingly high level of inaccessibility has become the norm when it comes to 21st century medicine.\n\nInaccessibility issues often start long before disabled patients make it to their appointments. I can drive myself most days or schedule my appointments when my fianc\u00e9 can drive me \u2015 and good thing, because I am never asked or given recommendations about transportation (except to be told I can\u2019t drive myself home post-anesthesia). Patients with disabilities who aren\u2019t partially ambulatory like I am often have to figure out the logistics on their own, which means complicated mass transit systems or paying out of pocket for paratransit rides. Paratransit riders often have to book 24 hours in advance, usually by telephone, and most agencies make riders pay with cash or a paper voucher. If a patient is d/Deaf, they might need a teleprinter/teletypewriter \u2015 a specialized text telephone that doesn\u2019t come cheap \u2015 to schedule the ride. Requiring cash payment means disabled people now have to take the additional step of making a separate trip to the bank in order to be able to pay.\n\nAnd before you suggest them, ridesharing options like Lyft or Uber are a far cry from a solution. They\u2019re often either inaccessible or rife with discrimination. Uber was sued in 2018 for its fleet\u2019s lack of wheelchair-accessible vehicles. Another 2018 study found that Lyft provided a wheelchair-accessible vehicle in only three of 65 attempts to request one \u2015 a disturbing 95 percent failure rate. Uber managed only 27 out of 49 attempts for a WAV. In all, researchers located a WAV in just 26 percent of attempts (compared with a 100 percent success rate for non-accessible vehicles).\n\nMedical offices themselves are an issue, too, as is the equipment inside them. Disabled patients often have difficulty using X-ray machines, rehab equipment, scales, scanning devices like MRIs and even just getting up on exam tables. Federal civil rights laws require medical offices to be accessible, but few are \u2014 and the ones that exist are hard to find. A 2012 study of 2,389 primary care facilities in California found that a mere 8 percent were equipped with a height-adjustable exam table, and less than 4 percent had an accessible weight scale. A 2013 telephone survey of 256 specialty offices across four U.S. cities for a fictional wheelchair-using patient found that 22 percent of practices reported they couldn\u2019t accommodate the patient. Amazingly, the clinicians who refused to accommodate the fictional patient also failed to recognize that their refusal was illegal under the Americans With Disabilities Act.\n\nIf you aren\u2019t disabled and haven\u2019t thought about these issues before, it\u2019s time to take a look around. After all, disability is eventually guaranteed to all of us.\n\nThose very same ADA laws also mandate that hospitals receiving federal funding provide deaf patients with help to ensure effective communication. However, while I frequently see hospital signs declaring patients have easy access to other language interpreters, I\u2019ve never seen one mentioning the availability of an American Sign Language interpreter. And, as a patient, I\u2019m never asked about any hearing issues, even though I\u2019m hard of hearing as a result of jaw surgery in 2013 (and far too many rock concerts without earplugs). I\u2019m rarely offered alternatives to spoken communication, like written pamphlets, and I am never asked about learning disabilities like dyscalculia, dyslexia or auditory processing disorders.\n\nDoctors carry their own deeply ingrained assumptions about disability, and non-disabled doctors simply lack the understanding of what living with a disability actually entails. Research has shown that, as a result, disabled patients receive inferior health care, including less information about prevention and fewer screening tests, such as Pap tests and mammograms. A 2006 study showed disabled women with early-stage breast cancer were less likely than non-disabled women to undergo breast-conserving surgery. Those who did were still less likely to receive standard radiation therapy. Unsurprisingly, disabled people diagnosed with such cancers were significantly more likely to die as a result.\n\nPatients with intellectual disabilities (whether the diagnosis is accurate or not) are significantly more vulnerable in medical settings than the general population, and their decreased life expectancy reflects that reality. Studies show that less than 20 percent of medical schools teach their students how to talk with intellectually disabled patients about their needs. Delays or problems with diagnosis or treatment are the No. 1 reason why individuals with intellectual disabilities die at least a decade earlier than non-disabled patients on average.\n\nInaccessibility and ableism are the name of the game when you\u2019re a chronically ill patient with a disability. And as with so many issues involving disabled people, we have to start at the beginning to enact fixes. Disabled people need to be involved from the ground up. This means medical schools need to offer clear instruction that teaches future doctors how to interact with and examine disabled patients, but it also means that medical schools need to be more accessible when including and training disabled students to become future doctors. More disabled doctors mean a more widespread need and appreciation for accessibility \u2015 for patients and for those giving care, too.\n\nInaccessibility and ableism are the name of the game when you\u2019re a chronically ill patient with a disability.\n\nAs usual, this means our world as a whole needs to place a much higher focus on making the world more accessible. I\u2019ve written before about how music venues and airline travel are widely inaccessible to wheelchair users, and medicine is no different. Our society hasn\u2019t yet insisted upon accessibility as a bare minimum, and disabled humans suffer as a result. It\u2019s an ouroboros of epic proportions: Disabled people are forcibly excluded, which is why non-disabled people don\u2019t think to include us. It often starts in preschool or elementary school, when the buildings are inaccessible, and continues through high school and extends into higher ed. When we can\u2019t pursue higher levels of education, we are excluded from job opportunities. Exclusion from job opportunities means we aren\u2019t the ones in medical school, insisting upon education about how to properly treat us \u2014 and we aren\u2019t the architects helping design accessible hospitals or doctors\u2019 offices, either.\n\nDisabled people make up 20 percent of the U.S. population, but 20 percent isn\u2019t enough to enact change, no matter how loud we\u2019re yelling. We need non-disabled people to join the rallying cry. If you aren\u2019t disabled and haven\u2019t thought about these issues before, it\u2019s time to take a look around. After all, disability is eventually guaranteed to all of us. Old age will alter your mobility, your functionality, your ability to move and your autonomy. At some point, the heavy glass doors at your doctor\u2019s office will stymy you, too. Wouldn\u2019t you rather the world be an accessible place before that happens?", "For the past four years my husband, Drew, and I have been traveling the world by van. It all started in 2011, after we both graduated from the University of Florida, where we met, and drove straight across the country to the Land of Dreams \u2015 Los Angeles \u2015 only to find ourselves, three years later, yearning for something that extended well beyond the reach of our desks.\n\nDrew had been working to start an online business selling refurbished luxury watches when he realized that the future he was creating did not align with his truest values. Similarly, I was fed up with feeling overworked, undervalued and lost in the stressful mix of night shifts and desk-sitting monotony that clouded my daily existence as the head of intake, aftercare and admissions at an eating disorder recovery center.\n\nWe both knew there had to be more to this life than what society had taught us to pursue. We felt stuck in an endless cycle of living for our weekends and it just didn\u2019t feel like enough \u2015 not enough freedom, not enough purpose, not enough creativity or joy. We wondered why we couldn\u2019t just be grateful for the lives we were living, but we felt numbed out \u2015 dead to the aliveness that we knew existed somewhere deep within us \u2015 and so we set out to find it.\n\nCourtesy of Mr. and Mrs. Adventure Drew and Brittany keeping each other warm and cozy in the middle of their first English winter, February 2016.\n\nAfter escaping the city for a weekend camping trip in Utah\u2019s Zion National Park in 2013, we wrote out our \u201cfreedom contract,\u201d something inspired by Tony Robbins or one of the inspirational books we were reading at the time. This contract was exactly what we needed to help us stay focused and committed to the unpredictable shift in reality that we were inviting into our lives.\n\nWe had originally decided that by April 2016 we would quit our jobs to travel and teach English in Southeast Asia. Until then, we would downsize, hustle and save every penny we could. As we signed our names next to the hand-drawn \u201cX\u201d on our contract, we couldn\u2019t help but feel that something big was stirring deep within our souls.\n\nThere were two parts of our contract that didn\u2019t roll out as we originally planned. The first was that when we told our families about our plans to go to Asia, a relative suggested we borrow a Sprinter Van that wasn\u2019t being used, so we could see all that our own country had to offer first. After half a moment\u2019s thought, we decided this was an offer we couldn\u2019t refuse.\n\nThe second part that we didn\u2019t anticipate was that we found we just couldn\u2019t wait to embark on our adventure. The business Drew had started was beginning to fall apart due to partner issues, and after leaving my position at the recovery center, I was struggling to make any sort of job stick. So, in December of 2014, we put what few possessions we had left in a 5\u2032 x 5\u2032 foot storage unit in San Diego and set off for Florida to pick up the campervan to roam the U.S. and Canada for a year.\n\nCourtesy of Mr. and Mrs. Adventure\n\nBecause it was winter, we decided our first stop would be the Florida Keys. It was there, parked next to the beach, that we mapped out the rest of our route based on the seasons and the dates of various events around the country that we wanted to attend \u2015 SXSW, Burning Man and the Albuquerque Hot Air Balloon Festival to name a few. We also planned a mini-trip to Iceland amid our North American cross-country trip, where we intended to spend two weeks seeing that country in a much smaller \u201cKuku camper\u201d van we had rented.\n\nOur route took us 21,000 miles up, around, down and across the continent in a roughly counterclockwise loop. We visited as many national parks as we could, including Acadia, Glacier, Great Smoky, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Sequoia, Joshua\n\nTree and Banff in Canada. We hiked to the top of the highest peak along the Appalachian Trail, summited California\u2019s 14,505-foot Mount Whitney (the highest peak in the continental U.S.), completed a three-day biking trip in Canada, went river rafting in Quebec, climbed Half Dome while in Yosemite and agreed to an impromptu 10-day boating trip with complete strangers down Alaska\u2019s Inside Passage from Sitka to Seattle.\n\nBack then we didn\u2019t think \u201cVanlife\u201d would become a way of life for us. At the time, our van was simply a vessel to help us squeeze as much adventure as possible into what we thought would be our only year of living life on the road.\n\nThe first three months in the van were hard for me. I was used to my \u201ccreature comforts,\u201d as well as the routine of my old life and the stability that had come with it.\n\nI was also used to having my own space, and suddenly sharing just 21-feet 24/7 with my soon-to-be husband took quite a bit of adjusting. I missed my yoga studio back in L.A. and the simple joy of taking a shower whenever I wanted to.\n\nBut as I began to move further and further into our journey, I was able to shed the needs I once had, and soon the rules I set for my former self faded away. I began to experience an incredible shift in perspective and realized that happiness didn\u2019t require any of that \u201cstuff;\u201d in fact, it really just got in the way of me being able to find it within myself. I could feel that living in a van was giving me everything that I needed to grow into the person I never knew I was always destined to be \u2015 and to finally find the happiness and freedom I\u2019d been desperately searching for.\n\nCourtesy of Mr. and Mrs. Adventure Drew and Brittany hugging The Howeller, their European honeymoon mobile, in Germany in June 2017.\n\nHalfway through that road trip, Drew was offered the opportunity of a lifetime. A company previously owned by his family was restructured, sold and in need of a new office manager, a position that could be fulfilled anywhere with an internet connection. Drew was the perfect fit for the role and, along with the small sum we make from some fun social media collaborations and our Amazon shop, we were \u2015 and still are \u2015 able to pursue roads that stretch far beyond our home country.\n\nAs our first year on the road came to an end, we figured if we could live together in a van for 12 months, there was nothing we couldn\u2019t do. So, in January 2016, our U.S. road trip ended with an unforgettable gathering of friends and family on the beach in Islamorada, Florida, for a celebration of our marriage. Then, instead of opting for a traditional honeymoon, we flew to England and used the money we were gifted to purchase our very first home together: A pre-owned, much-loved, 18-foot converted Ford Transit Van we dubbed The Howeller that ended up navigating us on a life-altering two-and-a-half-year honeymoon-on-wheels across Europe and Africa.\n\nWith no walls or routine to hide behind, we disconnected from society as we once knew it. Living on the road in foreign countries across foreign continents meant that everything, from languages to customs to food to values to the scenery we were taking in, was constantly changing \u2015 and ultimately, we changed too. Our van made all of it possible and quickly became our own little sanctuary, providing us with the stability we needed to grow and the comfort we needed to trust where our adventure was guiding us.\n\nWe spent nearly every day immersed in nature. We bathed in whatever body of water we came across \u2015 or, sometimes, in a bucket \u2015 and often days would go by without us even looking in a mirror. We hiked and biked. We explored and made friends with strangers of all shapes and sizes and backgrounds. We had less than we had ever had before, yet life felt so full.\n\nCourtesy of Mr. and Mrs. Adventure\n\nAfter over 40,000 miles filled with unparalleled experiences, we gave The Howeller away to a sweet newlywed couple before we left England. They had never lived or even traveled in a van before, and The Howeller was the perfect starter mobile. We also knew our beloved van had already had a good life \u2015 and was seriously rusty, so we didn\u2019t feel right charging them anything for it. The couple just needed a taste of freedom and The Howeller needed one last loving owner, so we felt it was the perfect way to say goodbye.\n\nWe returned to the U.S. this August, and since then we have wondered how and where to move forward with our lives. While it\u2019s easy to romanticize life on the road, it can still be deeply exhausting. Without a stable, non-moving home, the basic essentials of life require a lot more work, entrepreneurial endeavors and thoughts about raising a family become more complicated, hygiene and hot showers are limited, loved ones are usually far away and a lack of routine can make it hard to focus time and energy on executing life\u2019s greater goals. Yet, as the wise saying goes, sometimes the hardest things in life are the things most worth doing, and still, I believe \u201cVanlife\u201d is totally worth it.\n\nCourtesy of Mr. and Mrs. Adventure Drew assisting Brittany with her solar shower next to the sea in Quiberon, France, this past June.\n\nWe want to continue living our best lives and we\u2019ve learned, for us at least, that there is no roadmap for that. So, we\u2019re headed back out to roam and discover what the open road has in store for us this time. We recently purchased a new campervan and will be building out the interior ourselves using wood that\u2019s \u201creTREEved\u201d from the creation of urban sprawl in San Diego.\n\nHaving gone without any substantial source of stability \u2015 beyond each other \u2015for so long, we are building out this van to be more of an apartment/office on wheels. We don\u2019t necessarily want to live in a van forever, but we do know that we will always want to have a van. And with hopes of growing our family in the future, we\u2019re building out this rolling home with enough room to accommodate a few extra guests.\n\nAs soon as it\u2019s done, we plan to stay in the West and take things slow. After being in Europe for so long, we look forward to spending time in some of our favorite places along the coast, like Big Sur, and reconnecting every chance we get with our family and friends, many who also live in homes on wheels.\n\nWe also have plans to make our way up to Canada and Alaska for the summer and maybe even down Baja for the winter. After that, who knows? For now, the road is our destination, at least until we find that place we call \u201cDreamland,\u201d and we\u2019re willing to drive as far and wide as we need to find it.\n\nBrittany Rouille is an inspirational speaker, writer, videographer and social media influencer.

Rice, president of the California Professional Firefighters organization, which represents more than 30,000 first responders, rejected Trump\u2019s accusations and criticized the president for using the fires for political gain.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s message attacking California and threatening to withhold aid to the victims of the cataclysmic fires is ill-informed, ill-timed and demeaning to those who are suffering as well as the men and women on the front lines,\u201d Rice said in a statement issued Saturday.\n\nJustin Sullivan via Getty Images Firefighters work in dangerous conditions to fight the fast-moving fires in northern and southern California.\n\nRice called Trump\u2019s assertion \u201can uninformed political threat aimed squarely at the innocent victims of these cataclysmic fires.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s assertion that California\u2019s forest management policies are to blame for catastrophic wildfire is dangerously wrong,\u201d Rice said, noting that wildfires can be fueled by dry conditions, high winds and geography.\n\nRice also said that \u201cnearly 60 percent of California forests are under federal management, and another two-thirds under private control.\u201d\n\nAccording to the University of California\u2019s records, federal agencies manage 57 percent of the state\u2019s forests while local and state agencies, including CalFire, manage only 3 percent of forest areas. About 40 percent of forests are privately owned by families, Native American tribes or companies.\n\n\u201cIt is the federal government that has chosen to divert resources away from forest management, not California,\u201d Rice said.\n\nRice reminded Trump that, \u201cat this moment,\u201d firefighters are risking their lives by responding to the fire, \u201ceven as their own homes lay in ruins.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn my view, this shameful attack on California is an attack on all our courageous men and women on the front lines,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a similar renunciation, the International Association of Fire Fighters chided the president for threatening to take away money as firefighters risk their lives to save others.\n\n\u201cTo minimize the crucial, life-saving work being done and to make crass suggestions such as cutting off funding during a time of crisis shows a troubling lack of real comprehension about the disaster at hand and the dangerous job our firefighters do,\u201d said Harold Schaitberger, general president of the union.\n\n\u201cHis comments are reckless and insulting to the firefighters and people being affected.\u201d\n\nWithout addressing the threats he made to strip money from California, Trump shifted his tone on Saturday afternoon and tweeted praise for the firefighters responding to the disaster.\n\n\u201cOur hearts are with those fighting the fires, the 52,000 who have evacuated, and the families of the 11 who have died,\u201d Trump wrote.\n\nMore than 4,000 are fighting the Camp and Woolsey Fires in California that have burned over 170,000 acres. Our hearts are with those fighting the fires, the 52,000 who have evacuated, and the families of the 11 who have died. The destruction is catastrophic. God Bless them all. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 10, 2018", "HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. (AP) \u2014 Republican Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, a former speechwriter for President Ronald Reagan who later became Russia\u2019s leading defender on Capitol Hill and an outspoken advocate for legalized marijuana, was defeated Saturday, a victim of California\u2019s Democratic tilt and voters\u2019 distaste for President Donald Trump.\n\nRohrabacher, 71, was defeated by real estate executive Harley Rouda, 56, a Republican-turned-Democrat who pilloried the congressman for his skepticism over climate change and depicted him as an out-of-touch abettor in Washington gridlock.\n\nWith votes continuing to be counted, Rouda\u2019s edge grew steadily. The vote count updated Saturday showed Rouda with 52 percent of the vote and about 8,500 more votes than Rohrabacher.\n\nRohrabacher\u2019s ouster from his seat in Orange County has historical and symbolic significance. The county southeast of Los Angeles was home to President Richard Nixon and long considered a foundational block in the modern conservative movement. Reagan himself likened it to a Republican heaven.\n\nBut Democrats have picked off two GOP seats either all or partly in the county since Tuesday\u2019s election, and are threatening in two others. Democrat Mike Levin this week captured the seat long held by retiring Rep. Darrell Issa, which cuts through the southern end of the county.\n\nOrange County was once a Republican lock on Election Day, said Fred Smoller, associate professor of political science at Chapman University.\n\n\u201cTheir lock is over,\u201d he said.\n\nDemocrats had targeted seven GOP-held House districts in California this year that were carried by Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election, including Rohrabacher\u2019s 48th. They\u2019ve now won three of those seats, with the potential to pick up three more and pad their new majority in the House.\n\nDemocrat Katie Porter is inching closer to Republican U.S. Rep. Mimi Walters in Orange County\u2019s 45th District. In the nearby 39th District held by retiring GOP Rep. Ed Royce his protege, Republican Young Kim, sees her lead over Democrat Gil Cisneros tightening.\n\nIn central California\u2019s farm belt, Democrat Josh Harder grabbed a nearly 2-point lead after a vote count update Friday after trailing Rep. Jeff Denham in the 10th District.\n\nFor state Republicans, Rohrabacher\u2019s defeat represents another stinging blow for a party that has seen its fortunes wither for years. Democrats hold every statewide office, both chambers of the Legislature and a 3.7 million advantage in voter registrations. With Rouda\u2019s win, Democrats will hold at least a 42-11 edge in California U.S. House seats.\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans have tumbled to third-party status in the state: they are even outnumbered by registered independents.\n\nBehind the shift: A surge in immigrants in recent decades transformed the state and its voting patterns. In Orange County, largely white, conservative homeowners once delivered winning margins for GOP candidates year after year. But most of the state\u2019s new voters, Hispanics and Asians, are Democrats or independents.\n\nIt\u2019s also hard to discount the influence of Trump, who lost California by over 4 million votes in 2016. California is home to the so-called Trump \u201cresistance,\u201d which has stood in opposition to his policies on the environment and immigration.\n\nRohrabacher reflects the dramatic shift of fortunes in Orange County: He was re-elected by nearly 17 points just two years but met his end when Democrats backed a wealthy, pro-business moderate in Rouda.\n\nRohrabacher has long been an unusual figure on Capitol Hill.\n\nThe one-time Cold Warrior transformed into an outspoken supporter of improved ties with Russia, and his name has come up in the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election; he has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy was heard on tape in 2016 saying Rohrabacher was being paid by Russian President Vladimir Putin. McCarthy\u2019s office said the comments at a private meeting, disclosed by the Washington Post, were misconstrued and McCarthy was joking with colleagues.\n\nIn the campaign, Rohrabacher was faced with the prospect of making his Reagan-era conservative views appealing to newer voters, while holding college-educated Republican women who polls suggest are turned off by Trump.", "Critics were stunned that President Donald Trump skipped a visit Saturday to the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery in France \u2013 where U.S. war dead were being honored \u2013 because of rain. They zapped him with a a series of tweets showing Barack Obama in downpours honoring those who fought in wars in what was bound to be particularly galling to the president.\n\nAs many as 1,800 American soldiers killed in the World War I battle of Belleau Wood are buried in the French cemetery. But Trump ditched his planned visit and stayed in his hotel room because of unspecified \u201cscheduling and logistical difficulties caused by the weather,\u201d according to a White House statement. Instead, a delegation led by Chief of Staff John Kelly traveled to the cemetery 50 miles outside of Paris by car. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron were among the world leaders who made the trip.\n\nJim Young / Reuters Barack Obama wipes the rain off his face as he meets Pentagon staff and family members of the victims of the September 11 attacks in a ceremony marking the eighth anniversary of the tragedy at the Pentagon in 2009.\n\nWinston Churchill\u2019s grandson Nicholas Soames, a member of the British Parliament, blasted Trump as \u201cpathetic\u201d and \u201cinadequate\u201d for failing to show up.\n\nTwitter responded with scads of photos of Obama campaigning or speaking at various events in the rain. A number of them featured the former president in pelting rain honoring veterans or those killed in battle.\n\nThis is a real leader @realDonaldTrump. The rain...seriously? You have no idea what we go through in war and that's why us Vets should hold a special place in society.
