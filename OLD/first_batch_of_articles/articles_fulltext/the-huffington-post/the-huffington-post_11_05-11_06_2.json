["ASSOCIATED PRESS President Donald Trump shakes hands with Family Research Council president Tony Perkins at the 2017 Value Voters Summit, Friday, Oct. 13, 2017, in Washington.\n\nAn evangelical pastor\u2019s passionate defense of President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration policies is getting pushback from other Christians.\n\nTony Perkins, president of the conservative nonprofit Family Research Council and a longtime Trump ally, said Monday on CNN that although the Bible calls Christians to care for the poor and immigrant, this divine directive has limits.\n\n\u201cScripture does speak to the poor, it does speak to the immigrant, but it also speaks to the rule of law,\u201d Perkins told CNN\u2019s Christiane Amanpour. \u201cIn fact, in almost every instance you read in the Old Testament about taking in the poor, immigrant and stranger, it is then that they have an obligation to operate by your customs and laws. It\u2019s the assimilation, it\u2019s the rule of law.\u201d\n\nWhat does the bible teach about immigration?\n\n\n\n.@RevDrBarber told me that without scripture on how you treat the poor and the immigrant, \u201cthe bible would fall apart.\u201d\n\n\n\nEvangelical leader @tperkins says that while those sections are there, \"it also speaks to the rule of law.\u201d pic.twitter.com/MU5UnSVmj6 \u2014 Christiane Amanpour (@camanpour) November 5, 2018\n\nAmanpour had asked Perkins to respond to an interview she had on Friday with the Rev. William J. Barber II, a progressive Christian pastor and civil rights advocate who has been highly critical of Trump\u2019s hard stance on immigration. In that interview, Barber said that he believed caring for the impoverished and immigrants is a key biblical command.\n\n\u201cIf you cut out all the scriptures in the Bible that talk about how you should treat the poor and the immigrant, the Bible would fall apart,\u201d Barber said.\n\nPerkins, on the other hand, said he thinks Christians like Barber \u201cfail to see the rule of law and how the two go together.\u201d\n\nHe defended the Trump administration\u2019s track record on immigration, saying that he thinks the president is \u201cdoing the right thing by securing our borders.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have very generous laws here, you just have to do it by the rules, by law,\u201d Perkins said. \u201cAnd I think this president is enforcing the law as the American people elected him to do.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the Trump administration has made it even harder for people to gain asylum in the U.S. \u2015 announcing, for example, that fleeing domestic or gang violence is not grounds for asylum, even though these are some of the most common reasons migrants have for fleeing Central America.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union has claimed that border control agents are turning away or delaying asylum seekers who are trying to enter the country legally \u2015 denying them a right to apply for asylum that is guaranteed by both U.S. and international law.\n\nTrump\u2019s team has also been using inflammatory and racist rhetoric to describe asylum-seekers, including a so-called \u201ccaravan\u201d of thousands currently traveling to the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nMatthew Soerens, the U.S. director of church mobilization for the evangelical humanitarian organization World Relief, told HuffPost that he believes that the Trump administration\u2019s tactics at the border are arguably not respecting the rule of law.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really important to note that it is legal to request asylum at the U.S. border,\u201d Soerens wrote in an email. \u201cIn fact, given the tightly restricted nature of our immigration system today, for many of these individuals it is probably the only possibility for them to come lawfully to the U.S.\u201d\n\nNot everyone traveling with the caravan will qualify for asylum, Soerens said, but they all \u201chave the right to present their case and be considered.\u201d\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Central American migrants settle in a shelter at the Jesus Martinez stadium in Mexico City, Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2018.\n\nAsked about Trump\u2019s divisive statements, Perkins appeared to echo the president\u2019s rhetoric claiming that the caravan amounts to an \u201cinvasion\u201d of the country.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know who is in this caravan,\u201d Perkins said. \u201cThere are people that infiltrate that caravan that can come in and do not want to become part of the American family.\u201d\n\nResearch indicates that rank and file white evangelical Christians generally agree with Trump\u2019s hardline stances on immigration. However, evangelical institutions have also spoken out in defense of immigrants and refugees.\n\nSoerens told HuffPost he believes Perkins is right in one sense \u2015 it\u2019s true that the Bible teaches that immigrants and native-born Israelites should abide by the same laws. But this instruction also gave foreigners rights, such as protection from unjust labor practices and the right to a day of rest.\n\nThe Bible makes it clear that the rule of law is important, Soerens said. He doesn\u2019t think most evangelical leaders would urge choosing compassion over the rule of law. Instead, he said, they\u2019d like to see immigration reform that secures America\u2019s borders but also offers undocumented immigrants a path to citizenship and makes it easier for people to immigrate legally.\n\n\u201cRespect for the rule of law and promoting integration for immigrants are not mutually exclusive but rather mutually reinforcing,\u201d Soerens wrote in an email.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Family Research Council president Tony Perkins speaks to the 2018 Values Voters Summit in Washington, Friday, Sept. 21, 2018.\n\nOn Monday evening, Barber suggested Perkins was committing \u201ctheological malpractice.\u201d\n\n\u2033He never mentions Jesus, admits he\u2019s not trying to hold on to the essence of Scripture & refuses to admit that how we treat the poor & stranger is a central theme of the Bible,\u201d Barber tweeted.\n\nOther evangelicals have also spoken up to elevate the Bible\u2019s call to care for immigrants.\n\nEd Stetzer, executive director of the Billy Graham Center at Wheaton College, wrote in a Vox op-ed that the Bible repeatedly instructs Christians to welcome and protect foreigners. He believes Trump is trying to take advantage of evangelicals by stoking fears about immigration.", "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 A Bangladeshi immigrant convicted Tuesday of terrorism charges after setting off a pipe bomb in New York City\u2019s busiest subway station at rush hour told the trial judge he was angry at President Donald Trump and didn\u2019t carry out the attack for the Islamic State group.\n\nThe verdict against Akayed Ullah was returned in Manhattan federal court after a trial in which the defense maintained he intended to kill only himself last Dec. 11. Nobody died, and most of the injuries were not serious.\n\nAfter the verdict was announced and the jury left the room, Ullah spoke out, telling the judge: \u201cI was angry with Donald Trump because he says he will bomb the Middle East and then he will protect his nation. So I said: \u2018Donald Trump, you cannot do like this.\u2019 Nobody likes bombing, your honor.\u201d\n\nJudge Richard Sullivan told him: \u201cRight now is not the time for a statement.\u201d\n\nUllah repeatedly told Sullivan he did not carry out the attack for the Islamic State group.\n\nProsecutors said Ullah sought to maim or kill commuters in response to calls for \u201clone wolf\u201d terrorist attacks by the terror organization.\n\n\u201cYour honor, you heard what the government is trying to do. They are trying to put me in the group, which I don\u2019t support, your honor,\u201d Ullah told Sullivan.\n\n\u201cMr. Ullah, now is not the time for this,\u201d the judge told him.\n\nSentencing was scheduled for April 5, when Ullah faces a mandatory 30-year prison sentence and could be sent to prison for life.\n\nIn a statement, U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman said the Election Day verdict after an attack in which Ullah sought to make a political statement through deadly violence \u201cfittingly underscores the core principles of American democracy and spirit: Americans engage in the political process through votes, not violence.\u201d\n\nAt trial, prosecutors said Ullah would not have worn a bomb had he wanted to kill only himself. They also cited social media postings by Ullah, as well as comments he made after his arrest to investigators.\n\nThe verdict capped a weeklong trial that featured surveillance video of Ullah the morning when his pipe bomb sputtered, seriously burning him in a corridor beneath Times Square and the Port Authority bus terminal, where most subway lines converge.\n\nAt trial, Ullah was confronted with his post-arrest statements and his social media comments, such as when he taunted Trump on Facebook before the attack. The president later demanded tightened immigration rules.\n\nAuthorities said Ullah\u2019s radicalization began in 2014 when he started viewing materials online, including a video instructing Islamic State supporters to carry out attacks in their homelands.\n\nIn closing arguments Monday, Assistant U.S. Attorney George Turner said Ullah told investigators after his arrest that he wanted to avenge U.S. aggression toward the Islamic State group and had chosen a busy weekday morning to attack so he could terrorize as many people as possible.\n\nThe prosecutor said Ullah, 28, of Brooklyn, followed the propaganda of the Islamic State group online and obeyed its instructions to attack Americans.\n\n\u201cHis goal was to injure and kill innocent civilians, to terrorize,\u201d Turner said.\n\nThe prosecutor said Ullah told an investigator after his arrest: \u201cI did it for the Islamic State.\u201d\n\nGallicchio, though, said Ullah purposefully chose an isolated corridor to set off his bomb because he only wanted to commit suicide.\n\n\u201cThis is not a terrorist attack,\u201d she argued.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Shawn Crowley disputed the claim.", "Tap here to turn on desktop notifications to get the news sent straight to you.", "Beyonc\u00e9 on Tuesday shared her Election Day enthusiasm with fans, including support for Democratic Senate candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m feeling grateful for everyone before me who fought so hard to give us all the right to have a voice,\u201d the star wrote on Instagram. \u201cWe can\u2019t voice our frustrations and complain about what\u2019s wrong without voting and exercising our power to make it right.\u201d\n\nIn a series of three posts, the Texas native struck playful poses while sporting a \u201cBeto for Senate\u201d hat.\n\nO\u2019Rourke is running to unseat Sen.

She said that she thought it was weird to ask a bunch of adults to play hide-and-seek and declined to play but that Pinkett Smith and her husband, Will Smith, participated.\n\nPinkett Smith was later questioned about this passage on \u201cWatch What Happens Live,\u201d and she shrugged off the passage and the assumption that it was a creepy Scientology thing. She described the incident as completely innocent and said that some young kids were also involved in the game, including hers.\n\nRemini took this as a sign that Pinkett Smith was trying to discredit her account and had joined the Church of Scientology.\n\nDuring \u201cRed Table Talk,\u201d the 47-year-old \u201cGirl\u2019s Trip\u201d star said she responded the way she did on \u201cWatch What Happens Live\u201d to protect her and her husband and offer her recollection of the experience. She added that she was upset at Remini for even mentioning her and Smith in the book because, regardless of rumors and her curiosity about all religions, she and her family are not members of the church.\n\n\u201cI was hurt, but I never said anything,\u201d Pinkett Smith admitted.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t even considering that you would be hurt,\u201d Remini confessed, saying that when she wrote the book, she was \u201cgoing hard on my rightness\u201d and was \u201ccaught up in that pain\u201d caused by the church.\n\nRemini, 48, said she assumed Pinkett Smith was a Scientologist after her appearance on \u201cWatch What Happens Live\u201d because it seemed she was using a tactic Scientologists call fair game, in which a Scientologist discredits and attacks \u201canyone speaking out against the abuses of Scientology.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou get trained how to do this,\u201d Remini explained, saying that the Scientologist will first laugh at an accusation as if it\u2019s boring, then attempt to discredit it.\n\nShe said Pinkett Smith\u2019s appearance on the show was \u201ctextbook\u201d fair gaming.\n\nDespite their conflict, by the end of their conversation, both women said they understood where the other was coming from. They concluded, as Remini put it, that \u201cit\u2019s never too late to heal\u201d and ended their chat with a hug.", "Tap here to turn on desktop notifications to get the news sent straight to you.", "Pool via Getty Images Christopher Watts has admitted guilt in the murder of his pregnant wife and two children.\n\nA Colorado man accused of killing his pregnant wife and two daughters pleaded guilty to all charges on Tuesday in a deal that will allow him to avoid the death penalty.\n\nChristopher Watts, 33, pleaded guilty to five counts of first-degree murder, one count of first-degree unlawful termination of a pregnancy, and three counts of tampering with a deceased human body.\n\nWith the agreement of the victims\u2019 family, the district attorney eliminated the death penalty from consideration in exchange for Watts\u2019 guilty plea to all nine counts.\n\nHis wife, Shanann Watts, 34, was reported missing back in August, along with the couple\u2019s two daughters, Bella, 4, and Celeste, 3. Shanann Watts was 15 weeks pregnant at the time.\n\nIn the days after their disappearance, Christopher Watts spoke to local news stations and pleaded for his family to come home.\n\nOn Aug. 15, he was arrested. Soon after, his wife\u2019s body was discovered in a shallow grave on property owned by Watts\u2019 former employer, Anadarko Petroleum. Remains believed to be those of their two daughters were found in oil tanks nearby.\n\nProsecutors think that Watts killed his wife and daughters inside their home in Frederick, Colorado, before dumping their bodies.\n\nThe case has received widespread media attention, in part because the brutal murders appeared to come out of the blue. Shanann Watts was a prolific poster on Facebook and she projected the image of a happy, perfect family.\n\nYet while some aspects of the case are unusual, one aspect of the crime is unfortunately common: Most murders of American women are committed by current or former husbands and boyfriends.", "When Robert Palmer, 64, voted early Tuesday morning at his polling station in O\u2019Fallon, Missouri, he presented his passport as a form of identification to receive his ballot. He says the poll worker looked at him and asked, \u201cAre you a member of the caravan?\u201d\n\nPalmer, who is a bank administrator, said he was so shocked by the question that he didn\u2019t respond. Palmer said the worker looked away, then said, \u201cMorning humor.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was bizarre. I am not Hispanic,\u201d Palmer told HuffPost. \u201cI have an American passport. What does that have to do with the caravan?\u201d\n\nIn the lead-up to the midterm election, Republicans and right-wing media outlets have honed in on the so-called caravan, a large group of Central American migrants walking through Mexico toward the U.S., wrongly vilifying them as \u201cinvaders.\u201d President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign even ran an ad indicating men in the group were potential cop killers.\n\nPalmer went to the polls with his roommate, Shelley Powers, a 63-year-old computer engineer. She said she was also surprised and confused by the comment. Powers said the area is fairly diverse, and that people in line to vote were from diverse backgrounds.\n\n\u201cIt made no sense,\u201d Powers said. \u201cIt was very awkward and very uncomfortable.\u201d\n\nPoll workers have a duty to make voters feel comfortable and welcome, said David Becker, the executive director at the Center for Election Innovation and Research. He said it was not illegal for a poll worker to make an insensitive joke, and that this alleged comment would not qualify as voter intimidation because Palmer did not appear to be Latino.\n\n\u201cHopefully that exchange sent a message to the poll worker that he was being too flippant,\u201d Becker said.\n\nPalmer and Powers also described a broken scanning machine at their polling site. They said a worker who could not get the ballots to scan told several voters to place their paper ballots in a slot at the back of the machine.\n\nPalmer said he was hesitant to do that. He worried that his ballot would end up forgotten at the bottom of the pile and that his vote wouldn\u2019t be counted.\n\nHuffPost could not immediately reach the St. Charles County registrar\u2019s office on Tuesday due to call volume. The registrar\u2019s office also did not immediately respond to a email about Palmer\u2019s accusations about his polling place, Holy Cross Lutheran Church.\n\nExchanges between poll workers and voters are some of the most important on Election Day, said Trey Grayson, former secretary of state of Kentucky.\n\n\u201cAs much as poll workers train and plan, those interactions with voters are usually positive,\u201d he said. \u201cBut sometimes they\u2019re not.\u201d", "Billboard has named Ariana Grande its 2018 Woman of the Year.\n\nIn an article published Tuesday, Billboard noted that the 25-year-old has had \u201can incredibly successful year.\u201d The singer\u2019s recent album \u201cSweetener\u201d became her third album to top the Billboard 200 chart.\n\nGrande \u201cis a star on her own terms, never bending to any particular musical trend or path in the industry,\u201d Ross Scarano, Billboard\u2019s vice president of content, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cCertain in her convictions, she consistently stands up for herself and her decisions in a world that often isn\u2019t hospitable to that sort of strength in young women,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s got guts, she\u2019s making some of the best music of her career, and she\u2019s absolutely deserving of Woman of the Year.\u201d\n\nthank u for this honor @billboard \ud83d\udda4 \u2014 Ariana Grande (@ArianaGrande) November 6, 2018\n\nBillboard also recognized Grande\u2019s activism, saying she \u201cuses her platform and strength to support causes she believes in.\u201d\n\nGrande, who released a new song called \u201cthank u, next\u201d over the weekend, responded to the news on Twitter, calling it an \u201chonor.\u201d", "Poll workers in Georgia appear to have been unprepared for the waves of voters who turned out on Tuesday. Officials were scrambling to bring additional equipment to the polls and to field calls from frustrated voters forced to wait in line for hours across the state. Meanwhile, some who called county officials got busy signals or reached voicemail boxes for election offices that were full.\n\n\u201cWe are very fortunate that Georgia has robust early voting, because without that we can only imagine how hard the problems would be today,\u201d said David Becker, the executive director of the Center for Election Innovation & Research.\n\nVoter Linda Marshall said she spent two hours trying to vote at the Cathedral of St. Philip in Atlanta. Marshall said she registered to vote after moving to Atlanta, but the manager at the polling place said she wasn\u2019t in the system. He refused to give her a provisional ballot, and the phone numbers he told her to call were disconnected. Fulton County did not respond to a request for comment about Marshall\u2019s experience.\n\nIf I have to be here til tomorrow, I\u2019m gonna vote. Sandra Thomas, 70\n\nAfter leaving, Marshall called a legal aid, and lawyers referred her to a Georgia law saying she\u2019s entitled to a provisional ballot. She said she hasn\u2019t decided if she\u2019ll try going back. \u201cWhat they\u2019re doing at my polling station is outside of the statutes \u2014 it\u2019s illegal,\u201d said Marshall, 65. \u201cI haven\u2019t had to work so hard to vote ever. It was just a runaround, and I\u2019ve never experienced anything like this.\u201d\n\nTen miles south, hundreds of voters at Pittman Park Recreation Center faced wait times nearly three hours long. At noon, the line snaked out of the multipurpose room and doubled back on itself in a narrow hallway. Despite the line, voters seemed determined to stay put and the atmosphere seemed jovial. Organizers with the National Domestic Workers Alliance handed out Cheez-its, fruit snacks and Little Caesars Pizza to waiting voters, and voters chatted with each other as they waited.\n\nThe center serves mostly black neighborhoods in Southwest Atlanta, and multiple people told ProPublica they felt a sense of obligation to stay in line \u2014 their parents and grandparents had been unable to vote, and they were excited to cast a ballot for the first black woman to be a major party nominee for governor in the United States.\n\nJessica McGowan via Getty Images Voters line-up to cast their ballots at a polling station set up at Noonday Baptist Church for the mid-term elections on November 6, 2018 in Marietta, Georgia.\n\n\u201cI wanted this experience.\u201d said Tyrone Hodges, who said he\u2019d been in line for more than two hours. He said the wait was inconvenient but gave him hope that the Democratic nominee, Stacey Abrams, could win. \u201cWhen I see it packed like this, you know she\u2019s got a shot.\u201d\n\nSandra Thomas, 70, was similarly enthusiastic. \u201cIf I have to be here til tomorrow, I\u2019m gonna vote,\u201d she said.\n\nThe center generally serves fewer voters than were seen this morning, but the county merged a nearby polling location with Pittman and didn\u2019t allocate any additional polling machines. Voters were casting ballots on only three machines until the county dispatched five more late in the morning, and those in line said it started to move more quickly after that.\n\nTrey Greyson, the former Republican secretary of state for Kentucky, said that election administrators have to balance \u201cspending extra money on equipment when experience tells they won\u2019t be needed,\u201d and that turnout across the country has taken administrators by surprise. Additionally, the use of electronic voting machines makes states less nimble, he said. \u201cYou can print more paper ballots, but you can\u2019t produce more machines immediately,\u201d he said, explaining the long delays voters are facing as the county works to produce more equipment.\n\nTim Harper is a policy analyst with the Bipartisan Policy Center\u2019s Democracy Project, who conducted research into lines using data from the 2016 elections. Harper said polling locations unable to clear long lines within two hours of the polls opening are likely to face long lines for the rest of the day unless the counties allocate additional resources.\n\n\u201cWithout adding additional resources to the polls \u2014 like pollbooks, or check-in clerks, or voting stations \u2014 that line is not going to go anywhere,\u201d he said.\n\nOther counties are similarly having to scramble as high turnout and faulty equipment has forced voters to wait in line for hours.\n\nDekalb County had to replace a surge protector that was affecting the voting machines at Jolly Elementary in Clarkston, Georgia, a city northeast of Atlanta. County officials also sent two replacement machines to the site. Prior to the repairs, multiple voters reported wait times up to two hours.\n\nIn Gwinnett County, voters waited nearly five hours to vote after electronic poll books, which verify voter registration at the polls, were down at Annistown Elementary School. Voters cast provisional ballots, though the county eventually fixed the problem.\n\nKelvin Carroll arrived at 7 a.m., and the line didn\u2019t move until after 11. \u201cA lot of people left. I posted on Facebook almost every hour telling people not to give up,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were going to vote regardless. A lot of people fought and died for your right to vote, so don\u2019t give it up.\u201d The Abrams campaign held a news conference midday after the technical difficulties. Local candidates told voters that issues with voting machines had been solved, and they should stay in line. The secretary of state\u2019s office told ProPublica the location would extend voting for 25 minutes at the location.\n\nAnd in Henry County, the address of a polling place sent voters to a middle school. By the time Faith Foufa arrived at 6:20 a.m., she was the seventh person in line. After waiting for 40 minutes for the doors to open \u2014 with the line growing to around 50 people \u2014 nothing happened. Eventually, a woman came out of the school and told the line that their polling place was elsewhere, according to Foufa. \u201cPeople stormed off,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was absolutely ridiculous.\u201d The woman from the school gave imprecise directions to the polling location, so Foufa drove around for 20 minutes trying to find it. The voting was actually taking place at a gym behind the school, accessible from a different road. Tina Lunsford, the county election director, said there are now signs directing people to the right location and her office will try to amend the state\u2019s website.", "Drew Angerer via Getty Images U.S. Customs and Border Protection said they postponed the event \"due to inaccurate reporting that caused unneeded confusion.\"\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection postponed a \u201ccrowd control exercise\u201d on Tuesday in a heavily Latino neighborhood of El Paso, Texas, after criticism from civil rights groups that the Border Patrol training was scheduled for Election Day.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. Border Patrol\u2019s El Paso Sector postponed joint caravan-related exercises on the El Paso border scheduled for today out of an abundance of caution and due to inaccurate reporting that caused unneeded confusion in border communities,\u201d CBP said in a statement.\n\nCristina Calvillo-Rivera, a volunteer with an election protection coalition in Texas, went to the area where the exercise was scheduled to start a little before 9 on Tuesday morning and saw a parked Border Patrol truck and three agents.

Federal law doesn\u2019t require employers to give their employees time off to vote, but most states do provide certain Election Day accommodations for workers \u2015 usually a few hours of unpaid time off, with some states offering paid leave.\n\nPolicies vary when it comes to how much notice workers must give their bosses about plans to vote, and are typically contingent upon an employee not otherwise having sufficient time to cast a ballot before or after scheduled work hours. But even in these more generous states, employees may be reluctant to press their employers on exercising the leave requirements. And many employers may not even be aware of them.\n\nIn a number of states, including Connecticut, Louisiana, Michigan, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, employers are under no obligation to give their employees any time to get to the polls, according to the AFL-CIO.\n\nThe lack of protections for workers has led many voters to come up with their own Election Day routines. Earlier this week, we asked HuffPost readers to share theirs with us. We got a variety of responses, including from lots of people who said they\u2019d voted early or cast absentee ballots. A number of voters in Oregon and Washington, two states that rely heavily on mail-in balloting, said those systems offered a level of convenience they hadn\u2019t experienced elsewhere.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Voters wait in line to cast ballots on November 6, 2018. Federal law doesn\u2019t require employers to give their employees time off to vote, which leaves many Americans juggling voting with their jobs.\n\nJo Falkner, a 30-year-old marketing specialist who works at a brokerage firm in Sarasota, Florida, said she didn\u2019t even bother asking her employer about getting time off to vote on Tuesday. She recently started a new job, and said she felt like asking for leave might rub her boss the wrong way.\n\n\u201cI guess I\u2019m just used to employers thinking my generation is lazy and looking for any way to get a day off, and I\u2019m trying my damnedest to break that stereotype,\u201d Falkner told HuffPost.\n\nTo make things easy, Falkner decided to mail in her ballot in advance. But she said she didn\u2019t think the voting process needed to be such a headache. Falkner noted that other nations make voting mandatory or give people the day off to get to the polls, and suggested the U.S. could do something similar.\n\nMegan Williams of Troy, New York, wasn\u2019t sure if she\u2019d be able to find time to vote between shifts at her two part-time jobs. Williams, 38, said she didn\u2019t have access to a car, and felt it would be a struggle to make it to her polling place without missing work. Then she spoke with her brother, who was happy to help.\n\n\u201cI do plan on voting tomorrow thanks to my brother picking me up early before I have to head into Job #1,\u201d said Williams.\n\nEmployees at the Bradshaw & Bryant law firm in St. Cloud, Minnesota, get as much time as they need to get to the polls, said partner Michael Bryant. \u201cVoting is one of our important rights,\u201d he said.\n\nI make sure I\u2019m the first one at the polls to ensure I get it done.

Her shift at an office job ends at 5 p.m., and with polls in Wisconsin open until 8 p.m., Laabs said she should have enough time.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m confident about my plans because of how elections have gone since we moved to our current home in 2012,\u201d said Laabs. \u201cWell-run and efficient.\u201d\n\nRachel Engel, 31, had a brief moment of panic recently when her and her husband\u2019s absentee ballot requests were returned as undeliverable. She wasn\u2019t sure what had happened, but Engel said they were so eager to vote that they drove five hours on Monday with their two children, ages seven and four, to cast ballots at their old precinct in Wichita Falls, Texas, where her husband had previously been stationed in the military. They stayed at a hotel on Monday night, voted first thing on Tuesday, and then drove back for a half-day of work and school.\n\nBoth Engel and her husband\u2019s employers were willing to work with them to facilitate the emergency \u201ccivics road trip,\u201d said Engel.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very grateful they are helping us prioritize voting,\u201d she said. \u201cThis election is too important.\u201d", "Lourdes Leon ensured all eyes were on her at the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund gala on Monday night.\n\nThe 22-year-old daughter of Madonna wore a white tulle-draped dress with with sheer cutouts by Laur, a finalist at the event.

That includes work, relationships and even those precious zzz\u2019s.\n\nClare Kayden Hines, a 32-year-old artist from Berkeley, California, perfectly captures some of those frustrating plights in her illustrations, which she shares regularly on her Instagram. Hines, who lived with untreated anxiety for years until she was recently diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder, said turning her experiences into humorous art helps her cope.\n\n\u201cMy anxiety makes me feel like I\u2019m never doing enough, accomplishing enough, and that I\u2019m constantly falling behind or disappointing someone,\u201d she told HuffPost.\n\n\u201cI think all of us \u2014 women, in particular \u2014 are under a huge amount of pressure to do and be everything to everyone,\u201d she continued. \u201cMy art is my reaction to these pressures and expectations. It allows me to express my frustrations and anxieties out loud, and also laugh at them.\u201d\n\nOne of the most rewarding parts of channeling her anxiety into her work has been the reaction from other people who also live with anxiety. Hines said it helps to know there are many others dealing with the same thing.\n\n\u201cA lot of the time I don\u2019t know if anyone will relate to the weird stuff I put out there, but I do it anyway \u2014 and am pleasantly surprised and happy when I find out I\u2019m not the only one,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a reminder that I\u2019m not alone or crazy for feeling the way I do.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s true that Hines certainly isn\u2019t isolated in her experience: An estimated 40 million American adults live with an anxiety disorder, according to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America. The condition can be physically taxing, causing problems like headaches, a racing heartbeat and stomach issues.\n\nBut the emotional symptoms can be even more difficult for some people to deal with, and can include rumination, excessive worry, self-doubt and more. Those negative thoughts are the crux of Hines\u2019 anxiety.\n\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s anxiety is different, but if I were to give my younger self some advice, I\u2019d say no accomplishment is worth driving yourself into the ground for or sacrificing your health,\u201d Hines said. \u201cWe can only withstand so much pressure and negative talk before it backfires on us and impacts our bodies and minds.\u201d\n\nUltimately, Hines hopes that her illustrations don\u2019t just help her work through her anxiety, but that they also inspire others to talk about their own experiences and embrace their mental health.\n\n\u201cMy goal, beyond my art and my account being a creative outlet for me, is to make people feel less \u2018alone\u2019 by seeing themselves in my posts. The more we talk about the things we feel ashamed of, or think are abnormal, the more we\u2019ll realize we\u2019re not alone,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIf all of us shared how we felt with each other, we\u2019d realize all these stigmas weren\u2019t actually stigmas, they\u2019re normal and common,\u201d Hines added. \u201cAnd they\u2019re only as scary and powerful as we let them be.\u201d", "Duncan Hines has issued a voluntary recall for four types of its cake mix as the investigation into a salmonella outbreak continues.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration announced on Monday that it was working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to investigate a positive finding of salmonella discovered in a sample of the brand\u2019s Classic White cake mix.\n\nThe parent company for Duncan Hines, Conagra Brands, also voluntarily recalled the \u201cClassic Yellow,\u201d \u201cClassic Butter Golden\u201d and \u201cSignature Confetti\u201d cake mix varieties.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f RECALL ALERT \u26a0\ufe0f @US_FDA and @CDCgov are investigating 5 Salmonella cases that may be linked to Duncan Hines cake mix.

But it\u2019s also a love story, I think, between the protagonist Leola \u2015 based on Finck herself \u2015 and her shadow.\n\n\u201cEveryone has a shadow,\u201d Finck writes. \u201cBut not everyone\u2019s shadow can move, and talk, and think on its own.\u201d\n\nThe shadows belonging to the women in Leola\u2019s family \u2015 all the way back to her great-grandmother \u2015 can. Sometimes these shadows operate like guardian angels, pulling Leola and her matriarchs toward the right people and tasks. Alternately, they feel more like burdens, unwieldy reminders of what makes the women different, anxious and lonely. Shadows shape-shift into gut instincts, creative bursts, imaginary friends. They are our truest, weirdest, most unruly selves, the versions we can only see when standing in our own shoes.\n\nIn Finck\u2019s story, Leola eventually loses her shadow, just like the women before her did. People, creative women in particular, are socialized and normalized, the book insists. And the shadows drop away. But through drawing, Leola attempts to lure hers back.\n\n\u201cA draw-er doesn\u2019t draw because she loves to draw,\u201d she writes. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t draw because she draws well.

And by drawing, she will find it again.\u201d\n\nCourtesy Penguin Random House\n\nYou probably know Finck\u2019s cartoons from The New Yorker or her immensely popular Instagram. Her minimalist line drawings capture the emotional toll of both social interactions and loneliness. Her wiry, jittery style has become the contemporary aesthetic of anxiety, the visual manifestation of wanting, wavering and pressing onward, however imperfectly.\n\nYet Finck\u2019s cartoons are perfect in that they feel true, a simple but remarkable feat. As an artist, she\u2019s genuinely found her voice and embraced it, even when it\u2019s cranky, judgmental, awkward, political, goofy, whimsical or terribly sad. She is generous and ruthless on the page, drawing fears and insecurities that at times reach out a hand to hold you and pet your head, or simply howl alongside you in rage.\n\nPassing for Human is semi-autobiographical, focused on Finck\u2019s own journey moving from a person who fears their differences and shortcomings, to a person who embraces them and helps others do the same. The book is gorgeously rendered in black and white, light and shadow, the heavy black cross-hatching symbolizing the \u201cwomen\u2019s work\u201d so many women denied a traditional artist\u2019s path use to express themselves.\n\nI wanted to know more about Finck\u2019s life and work.

A recent campaign ad that compared the caravan\u2019s members to a Mexican citizen who killed two police officers in 2014 was denounced as \u201cracist,\u201d with CNN and Fox News refusing to air it.", "Seth Meyers on Monday night took a moment to shame NBC, his late-night home, for airing President Donald Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant ad during \u201cSunday Night Football\u201d this weekend.\n\nThe ad compares an undocumented immigrant on death row to the 4,000 or so Central American migrants walking to the U.S. border, suggesting the group is chock-full of similar criminals whom the Democrats will happily allow into the country.\n\n\u201cAny network should\u2019ve seen it for what it was and turned it down right away,\u201d Meyers said of the ad. \u201cBut unfortunately, not everyone did.\u201d\n\nCut to a local NBC affiliate reporting on the national network\u2019s decision to air a shortened version of the spot during a Green Bay vs. New England football game.\n\nCNN had already refused to air the ad, telling the president\u2019s eldest son via Twitter on Saturday that the network \u201chas made it abundantly clear in its editorial coverage that this ad is racist.\u201d\n\nAfter backlash over its decision, NBC announced Monday that it would no longer air the ad, which carries Donald Trump Sr.\u2019s approval.\n\n\u201cAfter further review, we recognize the insensitive nature of the ad and have decided to cease airing it across our properties as soon as possible,\u201d the network said in a statement.\n\nFox News soon followed suit. The president\u2019s channel of choice simply stated Monday that the ad would no longer appear on Fox News or the Fox Business Network.\n\nThe ad features footage of Luis Bracamontes, a Mexican citizen who received the death penalty for killing two police officers in California in 2014. Trump has been pushing out the ad over social media for nearly a week to rally his base through fearmongering before Tuesday\u2019s elections.\n\nPressed to respond to criticism of his midterm battle cry, he said, \u201cWell, a lot of things are offensive.\u201d", "NEW YORK \u2015 A star-studded slate of comedians and musicians filled the Hulu Theater at New York\u2019s Madison Square Garden on Monday night for the 12th annual Stand Up for Heroes event. Although the goal was to raise money for the Bob Woodruff Foundation, which supports injured veterans and their families, some celebrity guests couldn\u2019t help getting a little political onstage on the eve of the midterm elections.\n\nJon Stewart began his set joking about a caravan of Central Americans traveling north through Mexico and President Donald Trump\u2019s deployment of thousands of troops to the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\n\u201cAll the servicepeople, I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here.

Some people think he\u2019s a breath of fresh air. And some people think he\u2019s a fucking idiot. But one thing\u2019s for sure: He\u2019s a fucking idiot.\u201d\n\nStewart and Carr were joined by fellow comedians Seth Meyers and Jim Gaffigan, and Eric Church and Bruce Springsteen performed.

Throughout the evening, Woodruff and his wife, Lee Woodruff, stressed the importance of voting in Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections, particularly in light of the servicemen and -women in attendance.", "The \u201ccaravan ad\u201d from the Trump re-election campaign, which aired on NBC during \u201cSunday Night Football\u201d after being rejected by CNN, is racist. It is blaringly, blatantly racist. It is designed to make white Americans scared of Latin American immigrants, to stoke fears of crimes committed by brown-skinned people and evoke existential demographic panic among a slice of the electorate that has been primed by years of similarly racist propaganda to fear a changing country.\n\nBrian Kemp\u2019s campaign for governor of Georgia is racist. He has abused his office as secretary of state to purge and otherwise block black Georgians from voting, and his campaign has been aided in the home stretch by a robocall in which someone posing as \u201dmagical Negro Oprah Winfrey\u201d delivers a bizarre racist monologue.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS President Donald Trump and Georgia gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp.\n\nThe Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC tied to outgoing House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), has spent months airing dishonest ads slinging mud at various Democratic candidates. It has played a major role in the racist campaign against Antonio Delgado, the Democratic challenger to Rep. John Faso of New York\u2019s 19th District. CLF\u2019s ads refer in extremely unsubtly racist ways to the fact that Delgado once released a rap album.\n\nThe good news, such as it is, is that the mainstream, nonpartisan political press has been willing to call out these specific campaigns as racist, with no weasel words or qualifiers. CBS News called the pro-Kemp robocall racist. CNN called the caravan ad racist. Even The New York Times was willing to go as far as to say there were well-founded \u201csuspicions\u201d that the anti-Delgado campaign was \u201dmotivated by racial bias,\u201d which is about as plain-spoken as its news desk gets.\n\nBut these are still the exceptions. As the midterms hurtle to an astonishingly racist close, the nonpartisan political press has continued to rely on the old \u201cracially tinged\u201d euphemisms, taking care not to draw any conclusions about the party doing all the race-baiting. Call it denial-tinged journalism.\n\nLast Friday\u2019s print edition of The New York Times told us, \u201cTrump Favorite Struggles to Rise in Florida After Racial Stumbles.\u201d What a \u201cracial stumble\u201d might actually consist of is left to the reader to decode \u2014 I imagine the opening of \u201cThe Dick Van Dyke Show,\u201d except Rob Petrie trips over a stack of Home Owners\u2019 Loan Corporation redlining maps of Westchester County \u2014 though the web version helpfully updated the phrase to read \u201dracial flare-ups,\u201d as if racism were conjunctivitis. In the story itself, we\u2019re told Republican gubernatorial nominee Ron DeSantis has spoken at events organized and attended by \u201cfar-right extremists,\u201d with a link to a September Washington Post story that tells us DeSantis \u201cspoke at racially charged events.\u201d\n\nI do not believe, like Republicans who accused Barack Obama of being too soft on terror to say \u201cradical Islam\u201d or whatever, that speaking the correct words will magically make the enemy easier to defeat. But to beat back the rising tide of far-right ethnonationalism will require some sort of collective action on the part of people who are professionally unwilling to \u201ctake sides.\u201d Fox News addicts are unreachable, but NPR listeners and local newspaper subscribers should be told an accurate version of the story of the moment.\n\nThis is that story: The only appeal the conservative movement has left is white panic. And they \u2015 not just the demagogues like Donald Trump, but also the supposedly responsible wonks like Paul Ryan, and every shade of Republican in between \u2015 are shameless and irresponsible enough to go to that well again and again, if it helps them maintain power. The caravan ad is the entire Republican midterm message, and they are actively restricting the electorate to exclude the people who wouldn\u2019t fall for it. An entire political party stands united in its defense of the prevailing racial order, and its politicians are more than happy to say so in their campaigns. The racism isn\u2019t some oafish slip-up; it\u2019s the point.\n\nWhat makes that story so difficult for the mainstream press to tell?\n\nPart of it is a straightforward fear of being attacked by conservatives for perceived bias. As Tom Scocca wrote the other day: \u201cThe legacy media have been browbeaten into a perpetual terror of being seen as serving as partisans for the Democratic Party, until those are the only terms on which they understand the world and the work they\u2019re doing.\u201d To use plain language to accurately describe the actions of the entire Republican Party would make that party look so bad that it would be considered unfair and biased to have done so. And portions of the traditional press maintain the delusion that they can fight decades of conservative anti-press rhetoric by striving to be so \u201cfair\u201d to that side that they end up distorting what it believes and does.\n\nAnother reason is the special place accusations of \u201cracism\u201d hold in our elite discourse. In an industry still dominated by white men over 50, to be accused of racism is an injury on par with \u2015 or perhaps worse than \u2015 being actually targeted by racism. The stunted, elementary school-level way our old white editors and pundits think of race means that nothing can be described as \u201cracist\u201d without special knowledge of the inner mind of the person whose actions are clearly racist. It is a variation on the \u201cwe can\u2019t call it a lie if we don\u2019t know whether the liar knows he\u2019s lying\u201d rule, but even stupider. While the objective journalist can always reasonably fall back on calling things untrue without attributing motive, it requires a frontal lobotomy to render in the passive voice a mercenary campaign to make white Americans scared of a group of Central American refugees for political gain.\n\nBut another, possibly overlooked explanation for the utter inability of the press to describe the current moment is simply denial.\n\nThere are certain myths that are central to the ideology \u2015 one that defines itself as a total lack of ideology \u2015 of the nonpartisan journalist class. Some of those myths fall under a category that we could broadly call \u201cAmerican Exceptionalism.\u201d It is, basically, a child\u2019s faith that we live in the best of all possible countries.\n\nOne of those myths, universally believed by the Sunday-show types, is that America and its people are essentially Good. A corollary to this belief is that white rural Americans are the Realest Americans, and hence, the Goodest. This is not an original observation, but the Trump era, with the mask fully ripped off, has introduced a new wrinkle. This impoverished, limited worldview is now forced to grapple with these inescapable facts: One political party is running nakedly racist appeals to a solely white base \u2015 with essentially no exculpatory side issues or cover story anymore \u2015 and they are doing so because it works. At least, it works well enough to motivate a sufficient segment of the white population to show up for the Republicans to win power, so long as they currently have the power to suppress the votes of the demographic groups less amenable to far-right ethnonationalism.\n\nSo now the class that couldn\u2019t fathom how anyone\u2019s pastor could ever say the words \u201cGod damn America\u201d attempts to explain a world whose rules violate that class\u2019 core beliefs about the character of the American people, in the extremely limited way it has traditionally defined them. Pundit Americana requires the Realest Americans to be a people of rough-hewn racial innocence, perhaps reflecting the pundits\u2019 own blamelessness.", "A longtime confidant of John McCain, the late Republican senator from Arizona, has a message for American voters on Tuesday: \u201cRebuke\u201d President Donald Trump and support Democrats in the midterm elections.\n\nMark Salter, a former chief of staff and speechwriter for McCain, tweeted that voters should elect Democrats \u201cin most cases\u201d for the good of the country.\n\n\u201cVote For the Democrat (in most cases),\u201d Salter tweeted. \u201cThat feels weird to write.

But they\u2019re also complex projects with the potential to be misleading early on election night.\n\nWhat exit polls are:\n\nFor decades, news organizations\u2019 exit polls have been conducted by Edison Research for the National Election Pool, a partnership of ABC, CBS, CNN, Fox, NBC and The Associated Press. Those interviews \u2015 a massive, nationwide undertaking \u2015 are largely conducted outside polling places. But for the past dozen or so years, in an attempt to account for early voters, exit pollsters have also used telephone polls conducted over the final weekend of the campaign.\n\nThis year, there will be more than the usual set of numbers. AP and Fox News split from the consortium to launch an alternative called VoteCast, relying on interviews conducted just before the election \u2015 an approach AP says \u201creflects how Americans vote today: not only in person, but also increasingly early, absentee and by mail.\u201d The remaining members of the National Election Pool and their pollster, Edison Research, have announced major changes of their own, including stationing pollsters at early voting centers.\n\nWhat exit polls should, and shouldn\u2019t, be used for:\n\nExit poll numbers serve a couple of different purposes. News organizations use them to help call the results of races. And in the days to come, they\u2019ll help give everyone a better sense of how and when midterm voters made up their minds.\n\nExit polls are not, however, designed to help give the American public a sneak peak of who\u2019s likely to win, especially before the election is actually over. Fundamentally, exit polls are just surveys, and are subject to many of the same sources of error as any other poll. And, like any poll, they need to be properly weighted to represent the population they\u2019re supposed to be measuring. In this case, that means recalibrating the numbers to match the actual results of the election, which we won\u2019t fully know until the end of the night. Before that happens, exit polls can present a misleading picture of the race.\n\nWhy even final exit polling data isn\u2019t perfect:\n\nExit polls are a lot more useful \u2015 to those of us not calling races, anyway \u2015 once the results are in. But even then, they\u2019re not foolproof, especially at describing who voted.\n\n\u201cThe problem with them is that most analysts and readers treat them as if they\u2019re infallible,\u201d The New York Times\u2019 Nate Cohn wrote in 2014. \u201d[J]ournalists might write entire posts that assume that the black share of the electorate was 15 percent in Ohio. In reality, the exit polls just aren\u2019t precise enough to justify making distinctions between an electorate that\u2019s 15 percent black and, say, 13 percent black.\u201d\n\nThe National Election Pool is taking steps to address one of the biggest issues from 2016, which is that exit polls overestimated the share of voters with higher education levels, a group that, in the presidential election, was significantly more Democratic than those without college degrees. Exit pollsters this year are changing how they ask about education, and adjusting their samples to account for it.", "Playing Queen Elizabeth on \u201cThe Crown\u201d Netflix series has apparently given Claire Foy some insight into the tattoos her real-life counterpart may or may not have.\n\nIn a flight of fancy with host Seth Meyers on \u201cLate Night\u201d Monday, the actress said: \u201cYou never know what goes on from the neck down with the queen.

Three friends and I sat in the water, shoulders-deep, fingers upturned into the frigid air to proudly clasp our virgin ciders. When I caught Erica eyeing the strip of stomach my bathing suit left vulnerable, the words that came tumbling from her mouth made me flinch before they even landed.\n\n\u201cYou know, you\u2019re pretty hairy there.\u201d\n\nThere are no words to explain the emotional recoil when, as a preteen girl, someone points out hair on you anywhere else but on your head.\n\nIt was an innocuous statement, fuelled by nothing more than a knee-jerk, childlike curiosity, but Dana and Kate tittered on either side of her. Since we\u2019d been friends since kindergarten, the two of them had had ample opportunity to point out and attempt to \u201cremedy\u201d my cystic acne, which, since the third grade, had erupted across my face, chest, neck, and back. I\u2019d be lying if I said I remembered what my response was, but that revulsion\u2014rising like bile in my throat, pressing like a tongue against the backs of my teeth\u2014lingers.\n\nWhen I was growing up, no one spoke to me about polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). I didn\u2019t hear about it until, after being voted the \u201cugliest girl in the school\u201d for the second consecutive year by Dana\u2019s current boyfriend, I frantically Googled my symptoms, searching for a scapegoat to pin my appearance on. When I found it, the relief I felt at finally having an explanation for why I looked the way I did, was equivalent to a tsunami.\n\nBelieved to be one of the most common heterogeneous disorders found in women, PCOS is said to affect between 5 and 10 percent of women of reproductive age. Due primarily to an insulin resistance, the body compensates by ramping up insulin production, which in turn leads to excess androgens in the body. What does that mean? It means that myself and 1 in 10 other women suffer from symptoms that can include hirsutism (excess hair growth on the face, stomach, and back), cystic acne, male-pattern balding, menstrual complications, obesity, diabetes, ovarian cysts and potential infertility.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine how, as a parent, it feels to watch your child struggle so fiercely with themselves, and to witness them miss out on so much of their childhood because of it.\n\nAs a teenager, classes were spent obsessing over whether people were staring at my acne; breaks were reserved for sitting at the foot of my locker, too convinced of rejection to reach out to my friends; recreational soccer was spent comparing my body to other girls\u2019 long, hairless legs and budding breasts. After meals, I started shoving a toothbrush down my throat until I at least dry-heaved.\n\nAlong with my acne, my body became my biggest insecurity. The ring of fat around my stomach always made me feel as though I looked pregnant, and since my breasts had never come in due to my excess level of androgens, I had no fat on my chest to balance it out. My relationship with food, which at one time skewed toward binge-eating, had become a balancing act of eating a handful of almonds a day to ward off bloating.\n\nLooking back, it\u2019s hard to justify how deeply this all crippled me. Boys were mean to me \u2014 so what? So many have the same sob story. But in my senior year, I felt like I was on an island, surrounded by friends who kept me around to pick at my insecurities, but walled off by my own self-hatred.\n\nIt was shortly after my graduation that my mother approached me about breast augmentation surgery. Her best friend had recently gotten liposuction done by a local surgeon and was raving about her newfound confidence. Tentatively, as she told me after, my mom asked if she thought it would help my self-esteem. Her friend answered yes, absolutely, and passed the surgeon\u2019s information along.\n\nWhile I was told by clinic doctors that I was too young and underweight for liposuction, getting breast augmentation would address a huge source of my bodily insecurity. Even though both my mother and father believed that I was wonderful and normal the way I was, we all felt that the surgery would help me normalize my body type, help me feel confident enough to date, and hopefully stabilize both my relationship with food and my overall self-esteem.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine how, as a parent, it feels to watch your child struggle so fiercely with themselves, and to witness them miss out on so much of their childhood because of it. While my eyes welled up with joy at my mother\u2019s offer, her face looked sad, guilty, and hopeful all at once. My parents made me promise not to undergo any more cosmetic surgeries after this.\n\nThe procedure was scheduled for the following summer, shortly after the completion of my first year of university. Throughout the four pre-operation appointments, I felt nothing but anticipation. I spoke to the surgeon about my relationship to my PCOS, and she said that if either of her two daughters struggled with the same intense self-depreciation, she would offer the exact same surgery. We worked together to settle on an size that would look the most natural. Due to the severe underdevelopment of my natural breasts, we\u2019d be adjusting my barely A-cups to modest B-cups.\n\nI wish I could say that when the cast was peeled from my chest, ripping patches of skin off with it, that I felt like a butterfly breaking free from a cocoon, but I didn\u2019t.\n\nDoes the operation hurt? Absolutely. When I woke up in the recovery room, nausea roared to life almost instantaneously. I spent the day recovering in the hospital, dry-heaving, caught between elation and the pain-induced paralysis that gripped me from the waist up.\n\nI spent three weeks of recovery cocooned on my family\u2019s living room couch, unable to shower or use my arms for fear of tearing the stitches, drinking a cocktail of pain medications and antibiotics that left me in a miserable half-awake haze, punctuated by pain and nausea.\n\nI wish I could say that when the cast was peeled from my chest, ripping patches of skin off with it, that I felt like a butterfly breaking free from a cocoon, but I didn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t suddenly look or feel like Pamela Anderson. I was the same mousy 19-year-old with the stray dark chin hairs and untoned belly and rosacea-ridden cheeks. But it felt like a start.\n\nNow, at 21, I still have an immovable ring of fat around my abdomen, but getting breast augmentation gave me the confidence to rise above my depression and focus on nutrition and exercise. Even though my skin is still a battleground from over 10 years of cystic acne, I can deal with it without feeling suicidal; despite the scars that encircle my belly button from years of ingrown hairs, I can take my shirt off now without it feeling as though they\u2019re a glowing neon sign.\n\nWhile I still have fixations about my body, being able to do things like wear bras, bathing suits, and crop tops without feeling othered has been immeasurably healing for me. Of course, feeling better about yourself doesn\u2019t have to start with a boob job. While I felt that that was the best way forward for me personally, there are so many other avenues you can take in your pursuit of healthy self-esteem.\n\nIf you are suffering with PCOS, you are not abnormal. You are worthy of self-confidence, and it would be such a shame to isolate yourself away from the rest of the world because of something as minor as your appearance. Do what you need to feel the absolute best about yourself, but whatever you do, don\u2019t forget to live.", "MUENSTER, Germany (AP) \u2014 A 94-year-old former enlisted SS man went on trial Tuesday in Germany, charged with being an accessory to murder for crimes committed during the years he served as a guard at the Nazis\u2019 Stutthof concentration camp.\n\nJohann Rehbogen is accused of working as a guard at the camp east of Danzig, which is today the Polish city of Gdansk, from June 1942 to about the beginning of September 1944.\n\nThere is no evidence linking him to a specific crime, but more than 60,000 people were killed at Stutthof and prosecutors argue that as a guard, he was an accessory to at least hundreds of those deaths.\n\nStutthof prisoners were killed in a gas chamber, with deadly injections of gasoline or phenol directly to their hearts or shot, starved and even forced outside in winter without clothes until they died of exposure, prosecutor Andreas Brendel said.\n\nThe former SS Sturmmann, roughly equivalent to the U.S. Army rank of specialist, does not deny serving in the camp during the war but has told investigators he was not aware of the killings and did not participate in them, Brendel said.\n\nRehbogen\u2019s attorney, Andreas Tinkl, has said his client will make a statement in the trial at the Muenster state court, which is scheduled to last until January, but it was not immediately clear when he would speak.\n\nRehbogen lives in the western municipality of Borken near the Dutch border. In deference to his age and health, the trial is being restricted to a maximum of two hours a day, with no more than two non-consecutive days a week. At the same time, because he was under 21 at the time of his alleged crimes, he is being tried in juvenile court.\n\nThe Simon Wiesenthal Center, which helped locate some 20 Stutthof survivors for the case to serve as possible witnesses, emphasized that such trials are important, even more than 70 years after the end of World War II.\n\n\u201cThe passage of time in no way diminishes the guilt of Holocaust perpetrators and old age should not afford protection to those who committed such heinous crimes,\u201d said the center\u2019s head Nazi hunter, Efraim Zuroff.\n\nMany survivors, along with relatives of victims, are also joining the trial as co-plaintiffs as allowed under German law.\n\nEven though the number of suspects is dwindling, the special federal prosecutor\u2019s office in Ludwigsburg that investigates Nazi war crimes still has multiple cases ongoing. In addition to looking at camps like Stutthof, Buchenwald, Ravensbrueck, Mauthausen and Flossenbuerg, it is also investigating former members of the mobile killing squads known as the \u201cEinsatzgruppen.\u201d\n\nThe legal reasoning that being a camp guard is itself enough to be found guilty of accessory to murder, even without specific evidence of a crime, was first used successfully against former Ohio autoworker John Demjanjuk in 2011.\n\nDemjanjuk was convicted in Munich on allegations he served as a Sobibor death camp guard. He always denied the accusation and died before his appeal could be heard.\n\nThe 2015 conviction of former Auschwitz guard Oskar Groening using the same argument, however, was upheld by Germany\u2019s top criminal court on appeal, cementing the precedent.\n\nThe Stutthof case is the first time a prosecution is going to trial using this line of reasoning for a concentration camp guard instead of a death camp guard. But prosecutors have expressed confidence it can be applied, since tens of thousands of people were killed in Stutthof even though its sole purpose was not murder.\n\nStutthof was established in 1939 and underwent several iterations, initially being used as the main collection point for Jews and non-Jewish Poles removed from the nearby city of Danzig on the Baltic Sea coast.\n\nFrom about 1940 onward, it was used as a so-called \u201cwork education camp\u201d where forced laborers, primarily Polish and Soviet citizens who had run afoul of their Nazi oppressors, were sent to serve sentences and often died. Others incarcerated there included criminals, political prisoners, homosexuals and Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses.", "Despite its aging band members, Kiss still sings its party anthem \u201cRock & Roll All Nite\u201d with vigor.\n\nSo, when the band appeared on \u201cThe Late Late Show\u201d Monday in advance of its End of the Road farewell tour, host James Corden might have taken too many liberties with the good-time lyrics.", "You\u2019re either with Burger King or against it.\n\nJust ask rapper Kanye West, who the fast-food company flame-grilled on Twitter after he professed his love for rival burger chain McDonald\u2019s.\n\nIt began Sunday with this typical tweet from Ye, who has raised eyebrows in recent months with his staunch support of President Donald Trump and his subsequent announcement he was distancing himself from politics.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s is my favorite restaurant \u2014 ye (@kanyewest) November 4, 2018\n\nWest\u2019s endorsement of the Golden Arches wasn\u2019t actually much of a surprise.

But exact numbers were difficult to establish, it said, since only 28 mass graves have been excavated so far, with just 1,258 bodies exhumed.\n\nThese deaths occurred in what the United Nations has called a systematic and widespread campaign of violence, \u201cwhich may amount to war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide.\u201d\n\nDuring its three-year rule, the group terrorized local residents, conducting well-publicized executions of people targeted for their perceived opposition, government ties, sexual orientation and more.\n\nThe militants also targeted members of ethnic and religious minorities, including Christians and Yazidis.\n\nThe smallest mass grave, found in Mosul, contains eight bodies while the biggest, the al-Khasfa sinkhole south of Mosul, is thought to contain roughly 4,000 bodies.\n\nThe United Nations said the sites must be protected from interference or contamination to ensure justice and accountability.\n\nBut the Iraqi government body tasked with preserving mass graves says it is underfunded and understaffed, and cannot adequately protect and investigate the sites which are still littered with unexploded ordinance.\n\n\u201cDetermining the circumstances surrounding the significant loss of life will be an important step in the mourning process for families and their journey to secure their rights to truth and justice,\u201d said U.N.

Facebook has since identified and removed 30 Facebook accounts and 85 Instagram accounts.\n\nAlmost all of the Facebook pages were in French or Russian, Gleicher added, and the Instagram accounts were mainly in English and focused on either celebrity content or political debate.\n\n\u201cTypically, we would be further along with our analysis before announcing anything publicly,\u201d he said. \u201cBut given that we are only one day away from important elections in the U.S., we wanted to let people know about the action we\u2019ve taken and the facts as we know them today.\u201d\n\nFacebook had removed 82 pages linked to Iran late last month for the same reason.

In January, California, the largest legal marijuana market in the U.S., opened its first recreational marijuana shops. That same month, Vermont became the ninth state in the nation \u2015 and the first to do so through the state legislature rather than referendum \u2015 to legalize recreational marijuana (sales remain banned, unlike the other legal recreational states). Oklahoma became the 30th state to legalize marijuana for medical use in June.\n\nAnd while New Jersey lawmakers missed a deadline to legalize recreational marijuana earlier last month, they have vowed to vote on the legislation before the end of the year. Also last month, Canada opened its first recreational marijuana dispensaries, becoming the largest marijuana marketplace in the world.\n\nMarijuana is the most commonly used illicit substance in the United States. And the trend of states bucking prohibition in favor of legal regulation of the plant reflects a broad cultural shift toward greater acceptance of legal marijuana that has continued to grow in recent years. Now, two in three Americans support legalization. More than half of the states in the nation have legalized marijuana in some form. And states like Colorado, the first to establish a regulated adult-use marijuana marketplace, have seen successes that have debunked some lawmakers\u2019 and law enforcers\u2019 predictions that such policies would result in disaster.\n\nYet, despite states\u2019 efforts to roll back prohibition, marijuana remains illegal under the federal Controlled Substances Act, though President Donald Trump has signaled support for possibly softening the federal ban of the plant.\n\n\u201cSupport for legalization is growing rapidly around the country, and it is translating into victories at the polls and in state legislatures,\u201d said Mason Tvert, director of media relations for the Marijuana Policy Project, a drug policy reform group. \u201cIt\u2019s quite likely that we will see at least another two to four states adopt significant marijuana policy reforms between now and this time next year.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the ballot measures voters in four states will be considering on Nov. 6.\n\nTHE ASSOCIATED PRESS In the midterm elections, four states are considering ballot proposals to legalize marijuana in various ways.\n\nMichigan\n\nIf approved, Michigan\u2019s Proposal 1 would allow adults 21 and over to buy, grow, use and possess marijuana for recreational purposes. Under the measure, adults can be in possession of 2.5 ounces of marijuana, a provision similar to the state\u2019s medical marijuana law that was approved in 2008. Adults can also grow up to 12 marijuana plants in their homes for personal use. Additionally, the initiative legalizes the cultivation of industrial hemp, which can be used to make textiles, biofuels and foods.\n\nMarijuana sales would be accompanied by a 10 percent excise tax, revenue that will be used to fund research, education and the repair and maintenance of roads and bridges. A recent study projected that marijuana legalization in Michigan would eventually lead to $130 million in new tax revenue for the state with an industry that could grow to a value of $800 million by 2024.\n\nRecent polling suggests strong majorities of voters in the state are in favor of passing the proposal.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMeasure 3 on North Dakota\u2019s ballot would legalize the use, purchase and possession of marijuana for recreational purposes. But unlike traditional legalization measures, specific parameters of the program are not defined in the text of the initiative, so additional regulatory and tax framework would have to later be established.\n\nHowever, the measure does have some progressive contours that aim to repair the damage done by the failed war on drugs. If passed, there would be an automatic process created for North Dakotans to have their marijuana-related convictions expunged from their records. It also would make the state liable for any damages that are the result of expungement lawsuits.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether the measure has enough support to pass. In the months leading up to the election, polls have shown a slim majority in favor, a plurality supporting legalization and a strong majority opposed. North Dakota legalized medical marijuana in 2016.\n\nUtah\n\nUtah voters will consider Proposition 2, which would allow patients to legally use, possess and purchase marijuana for medical purposes for conditions such as HIV, multiple sclerosis, post-traumatic stress disorder, epilepsy, autism, cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s disease and others. During any 14-day period, a state-licensed cardholder could purchase as much as 2 ounces by weight of marijuana. The measure would ban the smoking of marijuana but does allow vaping, marijuana-infused edibles and other means of consumption.\n\nPatients who qualify would apply for a medical marijuana card from their doctor. Doctors would be restricted from recommending a card to more than 20 percent of their patients. Beginning in 2021, cardholders who live more than 100 miles from a state-licensed dispensary would be allowed to grow as many as six marijuana plants for personal medicinal use. It would limit the number of dispensaries to no more than one per county, except in larger counties where the state could issue more licenses depending on the size of the population.\n\nInterestingly, Utahns may get access to medical marijuana regardless of the passage of Proposition 2. In October, Utah medical marijuana advocates and state lawmakers agreed to a compromise bill that would legalize medical marijuana in the state but with some differences from the ballot initiative. The bill would require a full vote in the state legislature and a signature from the governor to become law.\n\nThe most significant changes in the compromise bill include: some qualifying conditions would be removed while others would be added, local jurisdictions would have more power to ban dispensaries in their regions, dispensaries would be forced to have a licensed pharmacist on staff and the shops would be renamed to pharmacies, edibles would be banned along with smoking but other ways to consume cannabis would still be allowed.\n\nUtah Gov. Gary Herbert (R) has called for a special session of the Utah Legislature after November\u2019s election, regardless of whether the ballot measure passes, in an effort to pass the compromise bill. The bill appears to have support from a number of key stakeholders in the state including advocates, policymakers and the Mormon church.\n\nMissouri\n\nVoters in Missouri will consider three separate proposals to legalize medical marijuana on their ballot: two constitutional amendments \u2015 Amendment 2 and Amendment 3 \u2015 and an initiative that would change state law, Proposition C.\n\nAll three proposals would legalize the use, purchase and possession of marijuana for medical purposes and would allow the state to set up a regulatory framework for licensed dispensaries to operate in the state. They each differ considerably in their approach to taxes, home growing and qualifying conditions, among other differences.\n\nSo what happens if all three pass? According to state law, if \u201cconflicting\u201d amendments or statutes pass, the proposal that receives \u201cthe largest affirmative vote shall prevail, even if that (proposal) did not receive the greatest majority of affirmative votes.\u201d However conflicts between an amendment and a statutory initiative, if both pass, may need to be decided in court, as the state attorney general\u2019s office indicated would likely occur for a similar potential conflict in 2016 over dueling Missouri tobacco tax proposals on the ballot that year.", "During the Obama presidency, Democrats lost hundreds of seats in places where much of the country\u2019s policymaking happens: state legislatures, governor\u2019s offices and other statewide posts. Republicans, in turn, have used these offices to gerrymander, union-bust and vote-suppress their way into further electoral victories. So, even as the race for Congress has dominated headlines this year, many Americans have rightly focused their energies and attention \u201cdown ballot,\u201d to state offices.\n\nBut if the headlines exclude state legislative elections, that goes double for races further down the ballot. Yet it\u2019s the city-, county- and town-level governments where issues of enormous importance to progressives get decided each and every day, and it\u2019s where the generational shift in progressive politics playing out in this midterm cycle will first affect many voters lives.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Devin Del Palacio, a Democrat running for the Arizona House, speaks at an African-American candidates forum along with Democrat mayoral candidate Tim Seay, justice of the peace candidate Sharon Sauls and Democrat candidate for Arizona Corporation Commission Kiana Maria Sears on Aug. 8 in Phoenix. They are four of at least 30 African-Americans who ran for local, state and federal offices in Arizona this year.\n\nIn much of the United States, it\u2019s county commissions that do much of the governing. They control substantial budgets \u2015 funded by local taxes \u2015 and often oversee vital and divisive policy areas, such as sheriff\u2019s departments, regional transportation, and housing development and zoning.\n\nThis year, these offices are a battleground for progressive activists. In Alamance County, North Carolina, the sheriff is an enthusiastic proponent of the 287(g) program, which allows Immigration and Customs Enforcement to deputize local law enforcement for the purpose of terrorizing immigrant communities. Some Republican commissioners have supported rejoining the program, which the county left in 2012. Candidates like Kristen Powers, an organizer with the Southern Coalition for Social Justice, are standing against this expansion, using her campaign to mobilize marginalized communities and fight for equity.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re actively campaigning against the reintroduction of 287(g) by engaging the Latinx community. We\u2019re canvassing in predominantly Latinx neighborhoods as well as hanging up signs around local tiendas and restaurants where the community frequents,\u201d said Powers.\n\nFrom president to dog-catcher, we have opportunities to turn our values into law.\n\nCounty commissions can also experiment with ambitious policy that may not be politically feasible at the state level. Stephen Wooden, running for Kent County Commission (Grand Rapids, Michigan, the home of Betsy DeVos), has also advocated against 287(g), while building on his career advocating for affordable housing and green energy development. Meanwhile, Meredith Place, running for Kalamazoo County Commission (Portage, Michigan), wants to protect access to county ID cards for undocumented people and expand drug courts in the county.\n\nEven local executive offices, such as city and county auditors and recorders, can be used to aggressively pursue progressive policy. In Columbus, Ohio, Megan Kilgore, the city auditor, has used her office to promote access to reproductive health care in the city. She\u2019s also encouraged the sale of city bonds to local residents and through local brokerages, rather than relying on Wall Street capital to fund the city\u2019s infrastructure investments. In Montgomery County (surrounding Dayton, Ohio), Brandon McClain, the county recorder, has issued thousands of veteran ID cards, giving the county\u2019s nearly 50,000 veterans easier access to the ballot as well as city social services.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Garlin Gilchrist narrowly lost a race last year for Detroit city clerk. This summer he was tapped as Michigan Democratic gubernatorial candidate Gretchen Whitmer's running mate.\n\nDown-ballot races are also important because they build a bench of talent. For instance, perhaps the most notable local executive race of 2017 came in Detroit. Garlin Gilchrist ran a dynamic campaign for Detroit city clerk, promising to streamline a broken voting process, the vagaries of which disenfranchise thousands of Democratic voters in the city, and he was backed by progressive organizations like Our Revolution. Gilchrist narrowly lost the election but focused the state\u2019s attention on the problems of voting in Detroit. This summer, Gilchrist was tapped to be the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor, and the ticket is poised to win by a healthy margin.\n\nThey\u2019ll likely be joined by secretary of state candidate Jocelyn Benson, who literally wrote the book on being a secretary of state. Given that voter suppression may well have swung Michigan red in 2016, that\u2019s no small victory.\n\nEven special commissions hold enormous power. In August, Detroiters voted to rewrite their city\u2019s governing document, and now they\u2019re voting on the delegates who will do so. This not only creates a major opportunity for needed progressive reforms, it also opens the door for predatory developers to write a charter that works in their favor. Electing good progressives in these races is critical. Candidates like Denzel McCampbell, policy director for BYP100 and an organizer for Engage Michigan, aim to implement participatory budgeting and require developers to grant community benefits for their projects.\n\n\u201cIf we want a better, more progressive country, we need to take every opportunity to get good people into elected office. County commissions, municipal executives and special elected offices can all be used to enact good policy and build progressive power, both now and in the future. We ignore these offices at our peril,\u201d said Arielle Swernoff, executive director of LaunchProgress PAC, which has endorsed many of these candidates.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Voters were lined up outside of the Vigo County Annex in Terre Haute, Ind.,. on Monday, Nov. 5, 2018.\n\nAnother Run for Something candidate, Lis Kenneth Regula, is running for Portage County auditor in Ohio, the influential position that sets property values. If elected, he will be the first openly trans person to hold public office in the state.\n\n\u201cOur candidates are changing the game with every door knocked,\u201d said Amanda Litman co-founder of Run for Something. \u201cAnyone talking about 2020 is missing the point. This election cycle has effectively sparked momentum to build the bench for the next generation and reached progressive voters never reached before.\u201d\n\nAs progressives, we must pay attention to all elections \u2014 from president to dogcatcher, we have opportunities to turn our values into law. And, as you head to the polls and watch the election results come in Tuesday night, remember the future of the Democratic Party is being determined by these down-ballot races that pundits rarely focus on. These candidates form the Democratic bench and will soon be the candidates running for the House, Senate and governorships across the country. A lasting movement starts with those who are running for and winning office at the local and state level, and it\u2019s there where progressives have plenty to be optimistic about.", "Vibe Voters in several states will have the chance to significantly reform the criminal justice system on Election Day: Marijuana legalization, deadly force by police and voting rights will all be on ballots.\n\nVoters in more than a dozen states will consider ballot proposals next week that would significantly reform their states\u2019 criminal justice systems by making them less punitive and more humane.\n\nHere are the most notable developments in criminal justice measures on the ballot in 2018:\n\nRestoring Voting Rights To Florida\u2019s Felons\n\nFlorida voters will consider Amendment 4, a proposal that would automatically restore the right to vote for as many as 1.4 million people currently disenfranchised because of prior felony convictions (but not convicted of murder or a sexual offense).\n\nThe disenfranchisement of felons prevents an estimated 6 million Americans from voting, including nearly 5 million people who have served out their sentences and are working, paying taxes and raising families. Florida has more disenfranchised people than any other state \u2015 nearly 10 percent of its population can\u2019t vote because of a felony conviction \u2015 and is one of just four states where felons don\u2019t regain their right to vote even after completing their sentence. If approved, the amendment would transform voting in Florida for generations.\n\nRetroactive Application Of Criminal Justice Reforms In Florida\n\nFloridians are also considering Amendment 11, a package of three constitutional amendments. One would allow for retroactive application of criminal justice or sentencing reforms that go into effect in the state, meaning those who are currently serving out sentences for a behavior that later becomes decriminalized or legalized could see a reduced sentence.\n\nDrug Sentencing Reform In Ohio\n\nOhio voters will consider Issue 1, an initiative that seeks to reduce the state\u2019s prison population and reform drug sentencing. If passed, the state\u2019s Constitution would be amended to make all nonviolent drug possession, use or obtainment offenses a misdemeanor instead of a felony. It would block jail time as a sentence for such drug offenses unless an individual committed a third offense within two years. Importantly, people who were convicted of such offenses prior to the amendment\u2019s pending approval could ask a court to retroactively reduce their conviction to a misdemeanor, even if their sentence hadn\u2019t been completed.\n\nJailing people for minor probation violations that aren\u2019t crimes would also be banned. The changes would also allow prisoners to apply for a sentence reduction if they have participated in work or educational programs. Finally, the measure would require the state to redirect the money it is saving through cutting incarceration toward various rehabilitative and crime victim programs.\n\nBanning Nonunanimous Juries\n\nAmendment 2 in Louisiana seeks to revise the state\u2019s Constitution by requiring felony convictions be decided by a unanimous jury. Louisianans currently can be convicted of any felony, including murder, by a nonunanimous jury \u2015 meaning that only a majority 10 out of 12 jurors need to agree on the conviction. The nonunanimous jury rule is a vestige of the state\u2019s white supremacist roots and was added to the state\u2019s constitution at the state\u2019s convention in 1898.\n\nThe intent of the the nonunanimous jury rule was made clear by the words of Thomas Semmes, a former Confederate senator, at the time when he said lawmakers at the convention fulfilled their \u201cmission\u201d to \u201cestablish the supremacy of the white race in this State to the extent to which it could be legally and constitutionally done.\u201d The rule has resulted in felony trials likelier to end in a guilty verdict, an outcome that has contributed to the Louisiana\u2019s alarmingly high incarceration rate.\n\nLegalizing Marijuana\n\nVoters in four states are considering legalizing marijuana, either for adult recreational or medical purposes. In another state, multiple cities are considering decriminalizing the drug.\n\nOhio\n\nSix cities across Ohio will consider local measures aimed at decriminalizing marijuana. Possession of up to 200 grams of marijuana is currently a misdemeanor in the state and punishable by a fine of up to $250 or as many as 30 days in jail. These local measures would not change state law but could make marijuana enforcement a lower priority for local police, thereby protecting marijuana users from some criminal penalties.\n\nMichigan\n\nIf approved, Michigan\u2019s Proposal 1 would allow adults 21 and over to buy, grow, use and possess marijuana for recreational purposes.\n\nUnder the measure, adults could be in possession of 2.5 ounces of marijuana, a provision similar to the state\u2019s medical marijuana law approved in 2008. Adults can also grow up to 12 marijuana plants in their homes for personal use. Additionally, the initiative legalizes the cultivation of industrial hemp, which can be used to make textiles, biofuels and foods. Marijuana sales will be accompanied by a 10 percent excise tax, revenue that will be used to fund research, education and the repair and maintenance of roads and bridges. A recent study projected that marijuana legalization in Michigan would eventually lead to $130 million in new tax revenue for the state with an industry that could grow to a value of $800 million by 2024.\n\nUtah\n\nUtah voters will consider Proposition 2, which would allow patients to legally use, possess and purchase marijuana for medical purposes for conditions such as HIV, multiple sclerosis, PTSD, epilepsy, autism, cancer and Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\nHowever, Utah residents may get access to medical marijuana regardless of whether Proposition 2 passes. In October, Utah medical marijuana advocates and state lawmakers agreed to a compromise bill that would legalize medical marijuana in the state, but with some differences from the ballot initiative. The bill would require a full vote in the state legislature and a signature from the governor to become law.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMeasure 3 on North Dakota\u2019s ballot would legalize the use, purchase and possession of marijuana for recreational purposes. But unlike traditional legalization measures, specific parameters of the program are not defined in the text of the initiative, so additional regulatory and tax framework would have to later be established. However, the measure does have some progressive contours that aim to repair damage done by the failed war on drugs. If passed, there would be an automatic process created for North Dakotans to have their marijuana-related convictions expunged from their records. It also makes the state liable for any damages that are the result of expungement lawsuits.\n\nMissouri\n\nVoters in Missouri will consider three separate proposals to legalize medical marijuana on their ballot. All three would legalize the use, purchase and possession of marijuana for medical purposes and would allow the state to set up a regulatory framework for licensed dispensaries. They each differ considerably in their approach to taxes, home growing and qualifying conditions, among other differences.\n\nThe Use Of Deadly Force By Police\n\nInitiative 940, which is on the ballot in Washington state, would introduce a series of measures intended to help hold police more accountable when they use unjustified deadly force.\n\nIf passed, the initiative would strip specific language from state code that requires prosecutors to show that an officer acted with \u201cmalice\u201d in order to be convicted. That language is unique to the state and has made it extraordinarily difficult for prosecutors to criminally charge an officer who uses deadly force recklessly. Whether the use of deadly force by the officers is justified would be evaluated through a \u201cgood faith test\u201d \u2015 a new standard that would be used to examine whether an officer in the same situation would reasonably believe that the use of deadly force was necessary. The initiative would also impose an independent investigation into all uses of deadly force by police. And it would require police to receive de-escalation, mental health and first aid training, as well as mandate that law enforcement officers have a duty to render first aid.\n\nCrime Victims\u2019 Rights\n\n", "WASHINGTON \u2015 As Democrats plan for a potential future in which they have control of the U.S. House, lawmakers, candidates and outside groups close to the party are quietly preparing a new push against the overlooked war in Afghanistan.\n\nThe last time the party controlled the lower chamber of Congress, the U.S. had close to 50,000 troops in Afghanistan. Today that number is 15,000 \u2014 but it\u2019s been eight years, and there\u2019s still no clarity about when the longest war in American history will actually come to an end. President Donald Trump\u2019s stated policy is that the U.S. presence has no time limit.\n\nSo Democrats are considering long-discussed proposals to torpedo the war\u2019s entire legal justification \u2014 the sweeping post-9/11 congressional authorization that has been used to support U.S. military action well beyond Afghan borders \u2014 and tie funding for the campaign to clearly outlined strategic goals and troop reductions. There\u2019s also talk of using new oversight powers to hold top officials, military commanders, defense contractors and foreign partners accountable for accusations of human rights violations, corruption and political posturing at the cost of human lives. And while party leaders are loath to commit to a particular course, they feel certain this is an issue their colleagues and their political base see as a priority.\n\nA dramatic but now largely forgotten vote in June 2017 underscored why this is a natural fight for Democrats. House Appropriations Committee lawmakers from both parties voted for the first time for a measure long pushed by war critic Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) that would repeal the authorization. GOP leadership quashed the effort, but it clearly signaled that, after years of worrying about being seen as too dovish, Democrats have reached a moment when even the other party and its voters can seriously consider serious antiwar action.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve come a long way\u2026 from just one vote in opposition [when the authorization came up in 2001] to a widespread recognition among members of Congress that this was an overly-broad authorization that set the stage for perpetual war,\u201d Lee wrote in an email to HuffPost. She sees Democratic unity on the issue today: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of common ground across the caucus around holding this debate and vote.\u201d\n\nReuters Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) pushed to revisit the war authorization last year and is set to push again against military actions in Afghanistan and Yemen.\n\nOutside figures in frequent contact with leading Democrats concur. \u201cEnding the war in Afghanistan is not actually a fringe position in the Democratic Party,\u201d said Kate Kizer of the progressive organization Win Without War. Ned Price, a former CIA official who worked for President Barack Obama and now helps run a group called National Security Action, agreed, noting that any divide is more on how to change course without breeding instability than the question of whether it\u2019s time to do so.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean the debate will be easy. It will pit lawmakers content with the status quo against figures formerly seen as fringe and vocal new colleagues critical of the Democratic political machine \u2014 many of whom fault Obama for ultimately abandoning his goal of bringing home the last U.S. troops from Afghanistan. And it will involve balancing lawmakers\u2019 divergent priorities, from campaign finance reform to health care. The hope among its proponents is that the energy \u2015 of new candidates, of resistance to Trump, of dissatisfaction with current politics \u2015 is on their side.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the new members who are coming into Congress, many of these folks, as well as a good proportion of the American public, were all preteens when this war started,\u201d Kizer said. \u201cSo I think as the war continued, there\u2019s a real question of, what are we doing?\u201d\n\nIf you look at the new members who are coming into Congress, many of these folks, as well as a good proportion of the American public, were all preteens when this war started. Kate Kizer, Win Without War\n\nAny debate will be informed by the well-documented failures of American plans to reform Afghanistan and develop a government and security structure that can prevent it from again becoming a playground for violent groups that might target the U.S. The Afghan government now controls only slightly more than half the country, a congressionally mandated inspector general reported on Nov. 1 \u2015 the lowest level since the watchdog began its tracking. The rest of the nation is under the sway of the Taliban, the hard-line group the U.S. deposed, and other organizations like the Islamic State.\n\n\u201cI have long been a proponent of a negotiated, diplomatic solution to the war in Afghanistan and for an end to this war period. Unfortunately, the war in Afghanistan has gotten us further \u2015 not closer \u2015 to achieving those goals,\u201d wrote Lee, who\u2019s expected to take on a new House leadership role in the next Congress.\n\nFrom War Vote To Peace Bills\n\nLee began confronting the prospect of endless war three days after the attacks of 9/11.\n\nDemocrats have since then tried to challenge the legal justifications for wars in the House and Senate, pressure the executive branch \u2015 including Obama \u2015 with votes against war funding and highlighted wastes of taxpayer money and other failures in implicit bids to call the whole endeavor into question. They have occasionally won Republican cooperation, but, in nearly every instance, Congress has tacitly blessed Pentagon-led requests for troop increases.\n\nWhat\u2019s different now is that years of worsening fighting on the ground make it harder to argue that the final Obama strategy continued by Trump \u2015 of keeping U.S. troops in Afghanistan while officially saying that they\u2019re not engaged in combat and that peace is possible \u2015 is working. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s own rhetoric questioning foreign policy orthodoxies and divides with his party on issues like trade and U.S. alliances have made it easier for lawmakers and outside groups to consider national security shifts that might have been taboo before January 2017.\n\n\u201cThe menu of options hasn\u2019t changed much in the past 10 years,\u201d said Shamila Chaudhary, a Johns Hopkins University analyst who served in the White House under Obama, noting that Democrats and Republicans have both spent years worrying about what might happen in Afghanistan without a U.S. presence.\n\nBut it\u2019s easier to make different choices from that menu.\n\nWith the Trump administration pushing a new high-level attempt at talks between the U.S.-backed Afghan government and the Taliban movement while simultaneously ramping up troop numbers, Democrats can lead congressional pressure for actual progress toward a negotiated peace, Lee wrote.\n\nFormer Obama advisers are already supporting the effort by pointing to their own success in small-scale engagement with the militant group \u2015 helping make clear that the approach is hardly a Trump innovation.\n\nRep. Adam Smith (D-Wash.), who will chair the House Armed Services committee if the Democrats take the House, is expected to use hearings and expanded powers to scrutinize Pentagon arguments.\n\nAnd Trump\u2019s reluctance to talk about human rights issues leaves the field to Democrats to highlight problems like Afghan military abuses and support for warlords, Chaudhury said, bolstering their general case for an ultimate end to the conflict.\n\nWith soldiers now enlisting who weren\u2019t even alive when the U.S. invaded Afghanistan, the years-long mushrooming of reasons to question the war means nearly every kind of lawmaker can get behind one, staffers and activists say.\n\nNew Voices In The Chorus\n\nAmy McGrath is used to people wanting to talk Afghanistan. They ask the retired Marine lieutenant colonel, a Kentucky Democrat who\u2019s become one of the best-known candidates for office this election cycle, why U.S. troops are still there and say it feels like America is losing. She told HuffPost she responds by creating a dialogue \u2015 she understands the frustration, but she feels at least some degree of American assistance is essential to prevent the creation of a militant haven.\n\nShe\u2019s quick to note that she hasn\u2019t been there since 2010, when she served her last tour in Helmand province.\n\nThat still, of course, gives her a degree of on-the-ground experience way beyond that of the vast majority of her future colleagues if she wins her tight race.\n\nAdam Beam/ASSOCIATED PRESS Democrat Amy McGrath speaks to supporters at a campaign field office in Winchester, Kentucky. She says Congress \"has totally punted\" the Afghanistan question.\n\n\u201cCongress for the last 17 years has totally punted it because they don\u2019t want to be held responsible,\u201d McGrath said of the debate over how to handle the war. \u201cThis is ridiculous.\u201d\n\nTwo groups loom large in the crop of candidates key to the Democrats\u2019 hopes of taking the House and general energy around the party this year. Both will likely feature heavily in conversations about issues like Afghanistan.\n\nMilitary veterans like McGrath and civilians who have worked in national security, like Abigail Spanberger in Virginia, Elissa Slotkin in Michigan and Andy Kim in New Jersey, have pitched their first-time campaigns as part of a lifelong call to duty on behalf of the country. Many of them are close to foreign policy experts \u2015 both Spanberger and McGrath have been in contact with Obama aides involved in the National Security Action group, spokespeople told HuffPost \u2015 who see Trump as a danger to important U.S. engagement around the world and are wary of radical change.\n\nThe other circle is identified with more proudly left candidates: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in New York, Rashida Tlaib in Michigan, Ayanna Pressley in Massachusetts, Ilhan Omar in Minnesota and Ammar Campa-Najjar in California. They\u2019re less vocal on foreign policy but are expected to line up with already elected allies, such as antiwar leader Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.). They\u2019re all endorsed by the Khanna-linked group Justice Democrats, which was formed by former presidential campaign staff for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). For now, they and their partners on Capitol Hill are focusing on the groundwork for a stronger progressive role in Congress more than on specific issues, a Democratic aide familiar with the interactions with HuffPost.\n\nShaped by similar experiences and politics, those groups are likely to rely on each other as they grapple with thorny new problems in their new jobs, united also by the sense of being newcomers.\n\n\u201cWhen we get together, we sort of all get it\u2026 we have all been over there, we know it,\u201d McGrath said. Rep. Conor Lamb (D-Pa.), a Marine veteran who won a special election earlier this year, told HuffPost he hadn\u2019t yet heard of the progressive effort to withdraw from Afghanistan.\n\nWhen we get together, we sort of all get it\u2026 we have all been over there, we know it. congressional candidate Amy McGrath, a military veteran\n\nBut the blocs already agree on key fundamentals like resisting Trump\u2019s attacks on the Affordable Care Act or the need for changes to Democratic leadership in the House. On Afghanistan, too, the distinction doesn\u2019t have to lead to a clash \u2015 deep blue or only marginally Democratic districts nationwide seem fed up. Both sides told HuffPost that for now they\u2019re optimistic about working together.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m encouraged by the number of veterans and national security officials running for office,\u201d Lee wrote. \u201cNo one understands the costs and consequences of these wars better than them.\u201d\n\nAnd the next few weeks \u2015 right after the midterms \u2015 could show how that kind of cooperation is already happening.\n\nA Post-Midterm Model\n\nDemocrats hope to move by December against a different war: a U.S. campaign of aerial refueling, intelligence support and arms sales for Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, who are jointly fighting a militant group supported by Iran in Yemen. It\u2019s a dry run of sorts for the Afghanistan fight.\n\nThe Yemen war, which began after the pro-Iran Houthi movement seized the capital from a Saudi-backed government, has produced the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis and bipartisan outrage in Congress reflected in increasingly tight votes on arms sales.\n\nNow Sanders, Khanna and others want the House and Senate to vote up or down on bills that would end U.S. support for the Saudi-UAE coalition altogether \u2015 and with United Nations warnings about the risk of famine growing more dire and outrage about U.S.-Saudi relations after the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, they feel the time is ripe.\n\nA Democratic aide involved in the measure pointed to the support of the No. 2 House Democrat, Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland, Smith of the Armed Services Committee, powerful Reps. Nita Lowey (D-N.Y.) and Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.), and scores of others, including some notable Republicans. In the Senate, Sanders and his allies had managed to win over more than half the chamber in the spring.\n\nAsked why not wait, particularly if the House does swing blue, the aide noted the fears of widespread starvation in Yemen and the belief that a vote against the war might send an important signal, putting the ball in Trump\u2019s court and setting Democrats up to press him in the new Congress.\n\nPresaging likely battles on Afghanistan and other controversial engagements like in Syria, the hope is the Yemen fight will unite Democrats around the U.S. war that\u2019s perhaps hardest of all to justify and show the party\u2019s base that its representatives can get things done.\n\n\u201cCongress has not reasserted its power on war-making for a very, very long time,\u201d said Kizer, the Win Without War activist. \u201cSo these war powers fights show they\u2019re starting to exercise that muscle and understanding that the public wants them to take up these hard votes.\u201d\n\nOr really, elections matter.\n\n\u201cWith this hopeful blue wave around trying to curb an out-of-control president, trying to rein him in in all forms and re-energize Congress as a co-equal branch, I think that that will also lend itself to building a more humane, restrained U.S. foreign policy,\u201d the aide said.", "ASSOCIATED PRESS A woman places flowers outside an LA Fitness in Collier Township, Pennsylvania, on Aug. 6, 2009, after George Sodini opened fire on an aerobics class there, killing three women.\n\nMary Primis, 35, was getting ready for a bodybuilding competition on Saturday morning when she glanced over at the television and caught the news.\n\nThe night before, a gunman opened fire inside a hot yoga class in Tallahassee, Florida, killing two women and injuring five others. According to reports, the man began shooting as people were settling into child\u2019s pose, a calming, grounding stretch often used to begin class. Of the seven people shot, six were women.\n\nThe scene was all too familiar to Primis.\n\nNine years earlier, she was instructing an aerobics class in Pennsylvania when a man entered the room and began shooting the women inside. Twelve women were struck by bullets, including her, and three of them died.\n\nThe perpetrator, George Sodini, shot himself. So did Scott Beierle, the man police say attacked the Tallahassee yoga studio on Friday. But the similarities between the two men run far deeper.\n\nBoth were white men in their 40s. Both targeted exercise classes traditionally favored by female clients. Both felt rejected by women and blamed them for their failures in life. Both posted their distorted, misogynistic ramblings online.\n\nAnd both left behind a group of survivors forced to live with those depraved actions.\n\n\u201cI know what I saw. I know how I felt,\u201d Primis told HuffPost on Monday. \u201cI know what they must be going through now, and I share in their grief.\u201d\n\nMary Primis in a hospital in 2009, a week after Sodini shot her and 11 other women at an exercise class she was teaching.\n\nAn Upbeat Aerobics Class, Then Lights Out\n\nIn 2009, Primis was 26 and teaching exercise classes at an LA Fitness health club in Collier Township, a suburb of Pittsburgh. She was newly pregnant.\n\nOn a late summer evening, she was leading a Latin cardio dance class. The room was full, she recalled, and all the participants were women. About 15 minutes into the class, she saw a man enter the studio.\n\nIt was 48-year-old George Sodini.\n\nPrimis was not initially alarmed, she said, because it was a busy club and people came and went. Then Sodini turned out the lights. In the dark, she was startled by loud pops. Unfamiliar with the sound of gunshots, she thought the lights were exploding. All around her, women were dropping to the floor, so she dropped too.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I felt the first bullet that I realized what was happening,\u201d she said. \u201cThen I felt the second one.\u201d\n\nPrimis was shot in an arm and in her back, with a bullet breaking her ribs, shattering a shoulder blade and popping a lung. She lay on the floor and played dead, holding her breath and staying as still as possible. She couldn\u2019t see Sodini and had no idea where he was in the room.\n\nFinally, the gunshots and screaming stopped, and the darkened studio was silent, save the thumping of dance music, which reverberated off the mirrored walls.\n\n\u201cI remember thinking, \u2018Please, someone turn that off,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nPrimis was transported to a hospital, where she remained for a week. In the meantime, the magnitude of the attack became clear. Three women were dead, including two of Primis\u2019 regular clients. And Sodini\u2019s motive began to emerge.\n\nHe left behind a blog.\n\nSodini\u2019s Incel Legacy\n\nFor nine months leading up to the shooting, Sodini, 48, wrote about his \u201cexit plan\u201d in an online journal and described his troubles with women. He bemoaned his inability to attract a partner and wrote that he had not had sex since he was 29.\n\n\u201cI dress good, am clean-shaven, bathe, touch of cologne - yet 30 million women rejected me - over an 18 or 25-year period,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThirty million is my rough guesstimate of how many desirable single women there are. A man needs a woman for confidence ... This type of life I see is a closed world with me specifically and totally excluded.\u201d\n\nHe complained that women treated him brutally in his youth and then ignored him in middle age.\n\n\u201cThe future holds nothing for me. Twenty five years of nothing fun,\u201d he said. \u201cI never even spent one weekend with a girl in my life, even at my own place.\u201d\n\nHe also posted odd YouTube videos in which he referred to his desire for a girlfriend.\n\nSince his death, Sodini has taken on semi-famous status among the involuntary celibate, or incel, community \u2014 men who believe they can\u2019t attract a partner and who blame women for their romantic and sexual failures.\n\nOn incel sites, posters sometimes use \u201cgoing Sodini\u201d as shorthand for committing a violent attack on women. Others use the term \u201cgoing ER,\u201d which refers to the much better-known attack by Elliot Rodger, who killed six people in a stabbing and shooting spree in Isla Vista, California, in 2014. Before going on his rampage, Rodger posted a manifesto in which he explained that he had \u201cno choice but to exact revenge on the society\u201d that denied him sex and love.\n\nThe shooting in Tallahassee is the second deadly attack this year with ties to the incel community.\n\nIn April, Alek Minassian drove a van into pedestrians in Toronto, killing 10 \u2015 eight of whom were women. Before his attack, he posted a message on Facebook celebrating the \u201cIncel Rebellion\u201d and Rodger.\n\nBeierle\u2019s Yoga Studio Attack\n\nLike Sodini, Beierle, 40, left a trail of online musings about women.\n\nIn YouTube videos believed to be posted by Beierle in 2014, which have now been removed, he railed against the \u201ctreachery\u201d of women \u2014 calling them \u201ccunts,\u201d \u201cbitches\u201c and \u201cvipers\u201d \u2014 and expressed a desire to get even with those who wronged him.\n\nHe claimed girls treated him harshly when he was young. Later in life, he said, they disrespected him, giving him their phone numbers when they had boyfriends or calling the police on him for no reason.\n\n\u201cMade one date, [she] didn\u2019t show up. Made another date, [she] didn\u2019t show up. Kept making excuses,\u201d he said of one woman. \u201cAh, I could have ripped her head off.\u201d\n\nIn one video, titled \u201cThe Plight of the Adolescent Male,\u201d Beierle said he related to Rodger.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think a female can ever understand a societal pressure that is put on an adolescent male to unburden himself of this stigma,\u201d he said, referring to virginity.\n\nHis hatred toward women was not limited to online videos.\n\nIn 2012, Beierle was arrested on two counts of simple battery after two young women told police that he grabbed their buttocks at a dining hall at Florida State University. In 2016 he was arrested again after being accused of grabbing another woman\u2019s buttocks at a pool at his apartment complex.\n\nThe charges in both cases were dismissed.\n\nIt remains unclear why Beierle targeted Hot Yoga Tallahassee and whether he had a connection to the studio or any of the victims.\n\nTo this day, Primis doesn\u2019t know why Sodini picked her aerobics class that night, though it appears to have been premeditated. He had a copy of the class schedule, investigators said, and her class was circled.\n\nShe said he probably he picked it because it was one of the largest classes the studio offered.\n\nAnd because \u201cevery week, it was all women,\u201d she added.\n\nNine years after the attack, Primis still has pain from shrapnel in her body, but she\u2019s stronger than ever, running marathons and entering in bodybuilding competitions.\n\n9 Years Later, Stronger But Changed\n\nAfter she was shot, Primis, who was 10 weeks pregnant at the time, put all her energy into getting better for her baby.\n\n\u201cI never really gave [Sodini] much thought. Or read much about him. All I knew is that he had killed himself and he just wanted revenge against women,\u201d she said.\n\nPrimis went on to have a healthy birth. Her son \u2014 her first \u2014 is now 8. A few years later, she had twins, now 6.\n\nNine years after the attack, she still has pain from the shrapnel lodged in her body. But she\u2019s physically stronger than ever, running marathons and entering in bodybuilding competitions. She lives in the same community in Pennsylvania and teaches exercise classes, though she never returned to LA Fitness.\n\nEmotionally, she said, she has been forever altered by Sodini\u2019s rampage.\n\n\u201cI still, to this day, don\u2019t trust people I don\u2019t know,\u201d she said. \u201cI watch everybody closely. When I am out in public, I always, in the back of my mind, have an escape plan and tend to plan for the worst, which is not the way I used to be.\u201d\n\nOver time, she has learned to forgive Sodini, she said, calling him a very sick person. While she wouldn\u2019t wish her experience on anybody, she said she isn\u2019t sorry it happened to her.\n\n\u201cI learned invaluable lessons,\u201d she said. \u201cLife is precious.

And if current rates of recovery continue, the entire protective layer \u2015 even the highly depleted parts over the poles \u2015 could heal completely by 2060.\n\nThe ozone layer\u2019s recuperation has been credited to the 1987 Montreal Protocol, which mandated that countries phase out chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and other ozone-depleting chemicals. The treaty, which was signed by 197 nations, has been described as the most successful environmental global action in history.\n\n\u201cIf ozone-depleting substances had continued to increase, we would have seen huge effects. We stopped that,\u201d Paul Newman, a NASA scientist and co-chairman of the new UN report, told the AP. He noted that if nothing had been done, two-thirds of the ozone layer would have been destroyed by 2065.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really good news,\u201d Newman said of the protective layer\u2019s recovery.\n\nThe ozone layer protects life on Earth from harmful levels of ultraviolet rays from the sun.\n\nIn parts of the stratosphere, it has recovered at a rate of 1-3% per decade since 2000, thanks to international cooperation - this is #ClimateAction success. https://t.co/cGQsaJNHnK \u2014 UN Environment (@UNEnvironment) November 5, 2018\n\nAccording to the report, the ozone layer, which protects the Earth from harmful ultraviolet rays from the sun, has been recovering steadily at a rate of 1 to 3 percent since 2000 thanks to the global efforts to reduce ozone-depleting chemicals.\n\nIf this rate of recovery continues, the ozone layer over the northern hemisphere and mid-latitudes could heal completely by the 2030s, the report said. Over the southern hemisphere and the polar regions, full recovery of the layer could be expected to occur around 2050 and 2060, respectively.\n\nDespite the promising news, scientists have cautioned against doing a \u201cvictory lap\u201d too soon. Recent reports have found that emissions of a banned CFC are increasing in China \u2014 something the Chinese government has vowed to crack down on. And the Montreal Protocol is set to be enhanced in early 2019 with the ratification of the Kigali Amendment, which seeks to curb future climate change by targeting powerful greenhouse gases used in refrigeration and air conditioning. Newman said we\u2019ll need to ensure that the replacements for these gases don\u2019t worsen global warming.\n\nScientists have also noted that the recovery of the ozone layer above Antarctica could slightly worsen the impacts of climate change in that region as the hole in the protective layer there has shielded the area from the full impacts of global warming. It\u2019s unclear, however, how much more warming can be expected once the Antarctic ozone hole heals.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we can do a victory lap until 2060,\u201d Newman told AP. \u201cThat will be for our grandchildren to do.\u201d\n\nStill, the UN said they were heartened by their findings about the ozone layer \u2015 and what its recovery could mean for future climate action.", "\u201cLate Night\u201d host Seth Meyers poked fun at President Donald Trump on Monday for his repeated use of the term \u201cbaby\u201d as an insult.\n\n\u201cWhy is he so obsessed with babies?\u201d asked Meyers. \u201cTrump has been all over the map on almost every issue throughout his life, but one thing he has always been very clear about is that he does not like babies.\u201d\n\nMeyers aired a supercut of Trump calling people babies, and defending claims that he was one.\n\n\u201cNothing makes you sound more like a baby than saying, \u2018I\u2019m not a baby,\u2019\u201d Meyers noted. \u201cIf you\u2019re not a baby, you don\u2019t have to clarify.\u201d", "A pantsless Stephen Colbert gave movie star Jake Gyllenhaal a scare in a comedy bit about the midterm elections on Monday\u2019s \u201cLate Show.\u201d\n\nColbert, as Ebenezer Scrooge, could barely contain his excitement about voting in the spoof of A Christmas Carol.\n\nBut there was only one thing on Gyllenhaal\u2019s mind...", "Who'd have thought it!

In far too many cases, Americans are blocked from exercising that right. This piece is part of that series, Democracy Denied.\n\nThis morning, millions of Americans will head to the polls to vote in the midterm elections. I\u2019ll be there bright and early, before they even open. My alarm will go off at 4 a.m. so I can be out the door by 4:45, and it will still be dark outside as I walk the 5\u00bd blocks to my polling place, PS 234 in Queens, New York. I\u2019ll barely be awake, but I won\u2019t mind. I love voting, and every election day I am filled with gratitude for the suffragettes who fearlessly fought for my right to do so.\n\nIn this moment, participating in the democratic process is, perhaps, more important for women than ever before. We are ruled by the grab-\u2019em-by-the-pussy president. Around the country, abortion clinics are being forced to close. Senate Republicans sent Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. It all creates an uphill battle for women\u2019s rights, and women have to show up in as many ways as we can. That\u2019s why I\u2019m a poll worker.\n\nA lot of people think the people who work elections are volunteers, but it\u2019s a job and you get paid for doing it. To work for the Board of Elections (BOE), you must first take a training class, so every summer I enjoy a very dry three- or four- hour training that reviews the rules and procedures for working on election day. In New York City, you get paid $100 for the training and $200 for each election you work \u2015 that\u2019s a nice little chunk of change. And, just as important as the money, every time I work an election, I get to do everything I can to make sure every person who walks in the door is treated with dignity and that every person\u2019s vote is counted.\n\nEvery time I work an election, I get to do everything I can to make sure every person who walks in the door is treated with dignity and that every person\u2019s vote is counted.\n\nOn the morning of the election, we all arrive at the polling site by 5 a.m. so everything is ready when polls open at 6 a.m. For today\u2019s election, as usual, I\u2019ll be working at my own polling place, on a ballot scanner. Each scanner is assigned a bipartisan team of two, so I\u2019ll have a partner with me all day to help open and close the machine. Polls close at about 9 p.m., after the last voter leaves, at which point we close down the machines and sign off on the ballot boxes. We usually walk out around 10 p.m. It\u2019s a long day, to be sure, but you make friends with the other workers, and on busy election days the time flies by.\n\nAmong the workers at my site, there\u2019s a civility to the whole process that\u2019s hard to find in these polarized political times. That\u2019s partly because we\u2019re not allowed to talk about our political opinions at all, for the entire day, and also because everyone is there to make sure the voters have the best experience possible. My fellow poll workers seem to genuinely understand how important it is that each voter be treated with respect, which makes for a positive energy at my site. This isn\u2019t universal across the country, and there are instances when poll workers disregard and dishonor this spirit of nonpartisanship. That only highlights how important it is for people who respect the voting process to consider becoming poll workers.\n\nEspecially because a good poll worker is hard to find. The U.S. Election Assistance Commission reported in 2016 that, in New York City and elsewhere, finding poll workers is a challenge, especially in big cities with large populations. Nationwide, it took 917,694 poll workers to run the 2016 general election, and that was with only 58% of eligible citizens (138 million people) voting. As voter turnout increases, we will need more poll workers. Voting sites cannot run without us, and there aren\u2019t enough of us right now. In NYC, they just announced raises for poll workers, which I hope incentivizes people to come work with us in the 2019 elections.\n\nAs voter turnout increases, we will need more poll workers. Voting sites cannot run without us, and there aren\u2019t enough of us right now.\n\nThe first time I worked the polls was the 2016 presidential election. It was beautiful to see so many people, and especially so many women, getting the opportunity to vote for a woman for president for the first time (of course, I also had to help people vote for then-candidate Donald Trump, and do so without comment). I\u2019ve worked every primary, special and general election we\u2019ve had in New York since then. The September 2017 primary elections had low turnout, which was both disappointing and disheartening, and also made for a long and boring day. It has been reassuring to see the voter turnout grow in each election since, and this past September\u2019s primary election was the busiest yet, which made the day go by incredibly quickly. I don\u2019t think I sat down the entire time. It was a physically exhausting day, but the increase in voter turnout was refreshing. I hope I feel the same after the polls close tonight.\n\nFor me, being a poll worker is a matter of civic duty and of family tradition. My grandma campaigned for local candidates and supported Planned Parenthood until the day she died. My mom now does the same and became a poll worker after protesting voter ID laws aimed at suppressing the vote in Pennsylvania.\n\nWhen I was growing up, my mom made sure I understood how important it was to engage in the democratic process, especially as a woman. I remember being surprised and upset to learn that there are people in power who don\u2019t see women as equals. I remember being furious to learn that my great-great-grandmother died because she did not have legal access to a safe abortion. As an adult, it\u2019s my responsibility to do everything I can to keep something like that from happening again.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t already, you should consider working for your county\u2019s Board of Elections next year. It\u2019s time for women, and for all Americans who care about women\u2019s rights, to rise from the ranks of merely voting and become protesters and canvassers and poll workers. And we\u2019ve got to teach our children, especially our daughters, to do the same.", "In a bid to get out the vote for Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections, the wrestler-turned-actor shared a snap on Instagram of himself holding his \u201cJumanji\u201d costar:\n\nHart has yet to comment on the post, but he\u2019ll likely take the joke well given his reaction to this image Johnson posted back in April:", "Rush Limbaugh received thunderous applause when he took the stage in Cape Girardeau, Missouri on Monday night for President Donald Trump\u2019s final campaign rally of the 2018 election season.

It was scanned for radio waves, but none were detected. Other scientists deemed it a comet, despite the lack of a traditional tail.\n\nNow professor Avi Loeb, chairman of Harvard\u2019s astronomy department, and post-doctoral fellow Shmuel Bialy have again raised the possibility that it\u2019s an alien ship \u2014 or possibly a piece of one.\n\nA certain \u201cdiscrepancy\u201d in the object\u2019s movement \u201cis readily solved if \u2019Oumuamua does not follow a random trajectory but is rather a targeted probe,\u201d they write.

Or it could be an extraterrestrial spacecraft that relies on an \u201cartificial\u201d light sail that relies on solar radiation pressure to generate propulsion, according to Loeb.\n\n\u201cThere is data on the orbit of this object for which there is no other explanation.

The singer\u2019s legal team sent a cease-and-desist letter to White House attorneys, saying that Rihanna had \u201cnot provided her consent to Mr. Trump to use her music,\u201d calling the use \u201cimproper.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt has come to our attention that President Trump has utilized [Rihanna\u2019s] musical compositions and master recordings, including her hit track \u2018Don\u2019t Stop the Music,\u2019 in connection with a number of political events held across the United States,\u201d says the letter, obtained by Rolling Stone late Monday.\n\nRihanna first learned that the president\u2019s pre-rally playlist included her music this weekend after The Washington Post\u2019s Philip Rucker tweeted about it, noting everyone at the rally was \u201cloving\u201d the atmosphere.\n\nThe singer quickly fired back, saying that wouldn\u2019t be the case for \u201cmuch longer.\u201d\n\nNot for much longer...me nor my people would ever be at or around one of those tragic rallies, so thanks for the heads up philip! https://t.co/dRgRi06GrJ \u2014 Rihanna (@rihanna) November 5, 2018\n\n\u201cMe nor my people would ever be at or around one of those tragic rallies,\u201d she wrote on Twitter, telling Rucker \u201cthanks for the heads up.\u201d\n\nTrump has earned the frustration of several musicians in recent months for using their music during his events.

An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released this week found 40 percent of respondents said they wanted their vote in the midterms to send a signal of opposition to the president, while 32 percent said they wanted to use it to send a signal of support. Months of public polling have found health care to be the top issue in the election, with Democrats holding a strong advantage in public opinion.\n\nThose two factors, combined with a surge of grassroots energy that has kept Democratic campaign coffers full and campaign offices brimming with volunteers for door-knocking. National Democrats are as confident as ever in predicting gains in House and gubernatorial elections.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at more Democratic governors, across a broad swath of the country,\u201d said Jay Inslee, the governor of Washington state and the chair of the Democratic Governors Association, who had just come from an event for Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams. \u201cThere\u2019s reason to be confident that more than half of the population of America will have a Democratic governor by midnight on election night.\u201d\n\nInslee\u2019s group has provided key assistance to Abrams and another rising progressive star, Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, in their bids for higher office. Democrats are optimistic that Gillum, who will spend election night rallying with Diddy at his alma mater, Florida A&M, will triumph over former GOP Rep. Ron DeSantis. In Georgia, however, both parties are now preparing for the likelihood of a costly run-off between Abrams and Republican Secretary of State Brian Kemp.\n\nPrognosticators now view it as likely that Democrats will win the 23 seats they need to reclaim control of the House. Republicans have all but ceded more than a dozen seats, and Democrats need to win fewer than half of the toss-up seats to claim Congress\u2019 lower chamber.\n\nIn states like Pennsylvania, where Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf is expected to cruise to re-election by a comfortable margin, the coattails of a popular chief executive could benefit Democratic House candidates in races that would likely not be competitive in an ordinary midterm election year. Some of those contenders in the Keystone State are Ron DiNicola, an attorney running in a district that includes Erie; George Scott, a military veteran and pastor running in a district that includes Harrisburg; and Jess King, a progressive Mennonite and nonprofit leader from Lancaster City.\n\nAll of these candidates, if they win, are expected to do so on the backs of white suburban women. In the NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, Democrats have a 55 percent to 37 percent lead over Republicans among female voters. Men favor Republicans by a narrower margin, 50 percent to 43 percent.\n\nThere\u2019s reason to be confident that more than half of the population of America will have a Democratic governor by midnight on election night. Gov. Jay Inslee (D-Wash.), Democratic Governors Association chair\n\nAmanda Roth, who has two children, earns a comfortable salary from her work at a small accounting company in Lancaster County. A self-described fiscal conservative, Roth remains a registered Republican and does not regret her vote for former Gov. Chris Christie in 2009 when she was living in New Jersey.\n\nBut on Saturday, Roth was spending her afternoon knocking doors for Jess King, the Democrat challenging freshman Rep. Lloyd Smucker (R) in one of the few Pennsylvania districts where Democratic fortunes soured after court-ordered redistricting in 2011.\n\nLike many of the suburban women flocking to Democrats this election cycle, Roth is motivated by her disgust with President Donald Trump, whose xenophobia and boorish conduct she says she cannot abide.\n\nYet when she described her passion for King as a candidate, she brought up health care, not Trump. Roth has soured on employer-sponsored insurance after years of enduring costly, inadequate coverage. Her current plan has a $6,000 deductible, so she tries to avoid going to the doctor.\n\n\u201cFor as long as I\u2019ve been working, I\u2019ve wanted a single-payer system,\u201d she told HuffPost while picking up her canvassing materials at a volunteer\u2019s house-turned-field office. Overhearing Roth, King stepped over to offer her a high five.\n\nAlthough King\u2019s district, which Trump won by 26 percentage points, is not even a secondary target for national party organs like the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, a late October poll showed Smucker with just a 4-point lead.\n\nRegardless of the outcome, King\u2019s competitive bid and the crossover support she has attracted for an unabashedly progressive platform underscores just how ominous the political landscape is for House Republicans on Tuesday.\n\nWith top Democrats confidently predicting a House takeover, Republican Party leaders are scrambling to limit the size of a Democratic majority.\n\nThat has taken the form of both last-minute efforts to buttress hitherto secure incumbents like Reps. Glenn Grothman (Wis.) and Brian Mast (Fla.) and distance themselves from figures like Iowa Rep. Steve King, whose sympathy for white nationalism is a liability in other parts of the country.\n\nOver the weekend, the major Republican super PAC charged with defending the GOP House majority, Congressional Leadership Fund, launched a six-figure get-out-the-vote campaign to save Alaska Rep. Don Young, the longest-serving member of the House, who is facing a tougher-than-anticipated challenge from independent Alyse Galvin.\n\nIf Democrats do face a downside on Tuesday, it will likely be in the all-important United States Senate. Democrats faced one of the toughest political maps in history, defending incumbents in 10 states Trump won. They are likely to lose the North Dakota seat held by Heidi Heitkamp, and seats in Missouri, Indiana and Montana are also at risk.\n\nDemocrats have pick-up opportunities in Nevada and Arizona, and early vote data in both states have made them more optimistic. They\u2019re less confident of making gains in Tennessee, where moderate former Gov. Phil Bredesen is facing arch-conservative Rep. Marsha Blackburn, and in Texas, where political phenom Beto O\u2019Rourke is more likely than not to fall to Sen. Ted Cruz. They\u2019re also confident of keeping a seat in Florida held by Sen. Bill Nelson, which Republicans had once promised GOP Gov. Rick Scott would take easily by using his personal wealth to outspend the Democrat.\n\nStill, if Republicans manage to win a majority of the toss-up races, a smaller Senate map in 2020 could make it difficult for Democrats to reclaim control of Congress\u2019 upper chamber until 2022 or 2024. Trump has concentrated his campaigning in recent days in states with competitive Senate races and ended Monday night in Cape Girardeau, Missouri, where he is rallying with the state\u2019s youthful attorney general, Josh Hawley.\n\nHowever, polls over the weekend looked good for Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill in Missouri, who is battling Hawley.\n\n\u201cShe definitely has the energy, and the field effort is better than anyone I\u2019ve seen in Missouri. Momentum is on her side,\u201d said Abe Rakov, who managed Democrat Jason Kander\u2019s Missouri Senate bid in 2016. \u201cIt\u2019s going to come down to the environment of Missouri, and whether her ground game is enough to overcome that.\u201d\n\nStatewide races throughout states where Trump surged \u2015 Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Iowa and Ohio \u2015 look good for Democrats. The four incumbent Democratic senators in those states are safe, and Gretchen Whitmer is all but certain to win Michigan\u2019s gubernatorial contest. Democrats have strong chances to finally defeat Gov. Scott Walker in Wisconsin and to win in both Iowa and Ohio.", "Abrams is in a right race against Donald Trump-backed Republican candidate Brian Kemp.\n\nKemp, who is Georgia\u2019s current secretary of state, had attempted to purge thousands of voters from the state\u2019s rolls if there wasn\u2019t an \u201cexact match\u201d between an individual\u2019s information on voter applications and on state databases. Discrepancies could be as minor as a middle name on a voter record and middle initial in a state database.\n\nIn a blow to Kemp, a federal judge ruled Friday that Georgia must ease its \u201cexact match\u201d demands.\n\nOn Sunday, Kemp suddenly claimed without evidence that Democrats had attempted to hack the state\u2019s voter registration system, and he launched an investigation.\n\nRoad to Power, which the Anti-Defamation League has described as a white supremacist and anti-Semitic group, has funded at least two racist robocalls against Florida Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum in recent months.

Trump, who coined the nickname \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted,\u201d repeatedly hurled insults at the senator and, at one point, repeated a baseless conspiracy theory linking Cruz\u2019s father to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Trump also retweeted an unflattering photo of Cruz\u2019s wife and threatened he would \u201cspill the beans\u201d on her (though it was never clear what he\u2019d been referring to).", "On Friday, lawyers filed a motion to stop the government from implementing regulations that they say would endanger immigrant children. But the Trump administration could still enact the new rules as early as Wednesday, which lawyers claim would violate a decades-old agreement known as the Flores Settlement that protects children\u2019s rights.\n\nLegal experts involved in the case told HuffPost that the new regulations, proposed by the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Health and Human Services, would allow children to be detained indefinitely in unlicensed family detention centers.\n\n\u201cIt would be disastrous,\u201d said Holly Cooper, co-director of the immigration law clinic at the University of California, Davis, and one of the lawyers representing the plaintiffs in the Flores case. \u201cWe\u2019ll see the indefinite detention of children in prison-like conditions.\u201d\n\nIn an email to HuffPost, an HHS representative said that \u201cas a matter of policy, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services does not comment on matters related to ongoing litigation.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration wants new rules to replace the Flores Settlement, which requires the government to hold children in facilities that meet certain health and services standards for the least amount of time possible.\n\nThe government said its new regulations, first released in September, would approximate the settlement by ensuring all migrant children are \u201ctreated with dignity, respect and special concern for their particular vulnerability as minors.\u201d\n\nBut advocates say the regulations trample on children\u2019s rights and completely contradict the 1997 agreement, which was named after a 15-year-old from El Salvador who was detained for two months despite having an aunt in the U.S.\n\n\u201cThey are just so far-flung from what these children bargained for back in 1997,\u201d said Cooper, adding that the Flores Settlement was meant \u201cto minimize detention times\u201d and hold children \u201cin the least restrictive environments.\u201d\n\nUnder the government\u2019s proposed regulations, children could be detained for any amount of time in family detention facilities. The Flores settlement specifies that a child should be released as quickly as possible to a parent, legal guardian, relative or unrelated adult who has been nominated by the minor\u2019s parents. But according to the new rules, children could only be released to a \u201cparent or legal guardian not in de\n\ntention\u201d \u2015 not to relatives or unrelated adults who could care for them \u2015 making it harder for children detained with their parents to leave.\n\nLawyers say the government has also manipulated licensing standards to evade time limits on child detention. As a general guideline, children are not supposed to be held in unlicensed facilities for more than 20 days, and family residential facilities are not state-licensed. But Neha Desai, the director of immigration at the National Center for Youth Law, says that the government\u2019s new regulations clearly specify that family detention centers won\u2019t be held to Flores\u2019 formal licensing standards, and instead outline a self-licensing process to side-step limitations on child detention.\n\n\u201cTheir attempt to license these unlicensed facilities is their attempt to create a legal cover,\u201d said Desai, who is also one of the lawyers representing the plaintiffs in the Flores case. \u201cThese children are going to be growing up in these [facilities.]\u201d\n\nLawyers are worried about the long-term effects detention has on children. Peter Schey, one of the lead lawyers on the Flores case and the executive director of the Center for Human Rights & Constitutional Law Foundation, says the proposed regulations \u201ccompletely ignore the damage that indefinite detention in isolated facilities with minimal access to the outside world ... has on the mental and physical well-being of children.\u201d\n\nCooper adds that detained children often develop psychiatric issues or contemplate suicide. And she worries that the new regulations will make it possible for President Donald Trump to build more unlicensed tent cities for asylum-seeking families, which he threatened to do in a recent Fox News interview.\n\nIf the government chooses to implement its regulations before the judge rules on the motion, lawyers representing detained children as part of the Flores settlement will still have 45 days to further challenge that decision in court.\n\nBut Desai doesn\u2019t think the Trump administration will be keen to make changes that protect children.", "Despite his promises earlier in the day, Fox News host Sean Hannity joined President Donald Trump onstage at a campaign rally in Missouri on Monday, praising the president while chastising other journalists as \u201cfake news.\u201d\n\nHannity hosted his hourlong program live from Cape Girardeau during Trump\u2019s last rally of the election cycle.

Scott Garrett (R-N.J.) made a similar comment about the NRCC that ended up costing him his bid for re-election the following year.

However, in Louisiana, that only a 10-2 jury vote is required not only challenges the constitutional guarantee of proof beyond a reasonable doubt and trial by a jury of one\u2019s peers but also seemingly undermines the Constitution.\n\nAccording to attorney Doyle \u201cBuddy\u201d Spell in Covington, Louisiana, the requirement does so by undercutting an already fallible court system and by allowing defendants in cases where substantial doubt exists to face a sentence of up to life imprisonment.\n\n\u201cEvery 10-2 jury verdict conviction handed down by Louisiana juries over the last 100-plus years violates the spirit of the common law principle that the government must, in any normal jurisdiction in America, prove each and every element of an offense beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d Spell told HuffPost.\n\n\u201cWhen two members of a 12-person jury oppose conviction, it\u2019s hard to argue that the jury did not find reasonable doubt,\u201d Spell continued. \u201cTo the contrary, it is reasonable doubt served up plainly for all of the world to see.\u201d\n\nThe Louisiana law was enacted more than 100 years ago, after the 14th Amendment mandated that black men be allowed to serve on juries. The law, according to the \u201cOfficial Journal of Proceedings for the 1898 Constitutional Convention of the State of Louisiana,\u201d was designed to marginalize minority jurors and \u201cperpetuate the supremacy of the Anglo-Saxon race in Louisiana.\u201d\n\nBlacks, at the time, represented 14 percent of all citizens registered to vote in the state. The law effectively ensured they could easily be outvoted by a majority of white jurors.\n\nDavid Lohr Elayn Hunt Correctional Center in St. Gabriel. Louisiana has one of the highest rates of exonerations in the nation.\n\nThe Louisiana Constitution does require juries to be unanimous in misdemeanor cases. Therefore, the state must be certain when convicting someone of petty crimes but not for sending someone away for a substantial period of time.\n\nAccording to The Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review, a six-year review of Louisiana criminal cases revealed 40 percent of individuals convicted after a jury trial were convicted by non-unanimous juries.\n\nThe law relieves prosecutors of the burden of proving their cases to an entire jury, especially when jurors who might represent the defendant\u2019s race or class can simply be ignored. The frequency of hung juries is also reduced, thereby increasing the risk of convicting an innocent person.\n\nLouisiana State Penitentiary Glenn Davis, left, and co-defendants at Louisiana State Penitentiary. Davis spent 15 years in prison before he was exonerated. He was convicted on a 10-2 jury vote.\n\nOne of those individuals was Glenn Davis Jr. In 1992, he was arrested and charged with killing a drug dealer. The only witness was an admitted drug user with an extensive criminal history. When the case went to trial, a jury consisting of nine whites and three blacks heard the evidence in the case. Davis was ultimately convicted in a 10\u00ad-2 vote.\n\nThe two who dissented were African Americans who, because of the law, had their viewpoints rendered insignificant.\n\nIn 49 other states, a mistrial would have been declared and the state would have had the choice to abandon further prosecution or retry the case.\n\n\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have been wrongfully convicted and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole, probation or suspension of sentence,\u201d Davis wrote in an editorial for The Advocate.\n\nInstead, Davis spent the next 15 years behind bars until he was exonerated with the assistance of Innocence Project New Orleans. And he\u2019s just one of many. Louisiana currently ranks among the top 10 states in exonerations.\n\nMelinda Deslatte/ASSOCIATED PRESS Louisiana state Sen. J.P. Morrell (D-New Orleans), at left on March 9, 2016, with a state Senate staff member, wants to strip a Jim Crow-era law from the state constitution that allows felony trials to be settled by divided juries.\n\n\u201cIt is no coincidence that Louisiana\u2019s incredibly high incarceration rate is directly tied to our Jim Crowe-era split jury system,\u201d New Orleans attorney Michael Kennedy told HuffPost. \u201cWe have to stop putting innocent people, or even the possibly innocent, in prison. Because where one or two people vote not guilty, there is reasonable doubt. And those jurors, and those defendants, deserve for their voices to be heard.\u201d\n\nThe future of the 10-2 jury law now sits in the hands of voters, who will ultimately have the final say in determining whether every juror\u2019s view in Louisiana should be considered. If the majority votes yes on Amendment 2, guilty verdicts will require consensus from all 12 jurors as of Jan. 1.\n\n\u201cThe time to erase this Jim Crow-era abomination is long past due,\u201d Spell said. \u201cMy fingers are crossed hoping that time has come today.\u201d", "Some cities are encouraging people to get to the polls on Election Day by offering free rides.\n\nMajor U.S. cities like Los Angeles, Dallas and Houston, Texas, and Tampa, Florida, are allowing residents to use public transit systems, including buses and trains, at no cost on Nov. 6.\n\n\u201cA lack of transportation should never stand between a voter and the polls,\u201d Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti told Curbed.\n\nIn a motion last month advocating for free transit on Election Day, Garcetti noted that \u201cstudies have shown that minority, low-income, persons with disabilities and youth voters in particular have consistently lower turnout than average. These populations are also the ones most reliant on [public transport] for mobility.\u201d\n\nIn a 2016 Massachusetts Institute of Technology survey of registered voters nationwide, 14 percent of respondents who didn\u2019t vote said that transportation was a \u201cmajor factor\u201d in their decision not to.\n\nIn Los Angeles, the county could lose an estimated $600,000 in fares on Election Day, a Metro spokesperson told Curbed.\n\nGo vote tomorrow -- rides will be free on Metro! https://t.co/v7xYMTrATQ pic.twitter.com/Gdm6AhIhZ1 \u2014 Metro (@metrolosangeles) November 5, 2018\n\nSome smaller towns and cities are also offering people a no-cost lift on Tuesday, such as in Goshen, Indiana; Lawrence, Kansas; and Owensboro, Kentucky.\n\nMajor rideshare companies are also pitching in, with Lyft partnering with nonprofits to offer free rides to people from \u201cunderserved communities that face significant obstacles to transportation\u201d and Uber offering $10 off a ride to the polls when using the most affordable ride option available.", "ASSOCIATED PRESS Ivanka Trump, daughter to the president and a senior White House adviser, has won preliminary approval for 16 business trademarks from the Chinese.\n\nThe daughter of President Donald Trump announced in July that she was shutting down her fashion brand. But she could transfer the trademarks \u2014 or even relaunch her fashion business. The Washington Post reported at the time that she planned to continue to seek trademarks.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s dissolving the company now but is continuing to get trademarks so she can sell her stuff all over the world later,\u201d Richard Painter, chief White House ethics lawyer for former president George W. Bush, told the Post then. \u201cWhat better time to get those trademarks than now, when every government around the world wants to play nice\u201d with her father?\n\nThe news again raises concerns about the Trumps mixing their private businesses with their responsibility to represent American taxpayers as they negotiate with the same interests they deal with in the White House, CREW noted Monday in its statement. Business arrangements with foreign entities that profit the Trumps could potentially function as bribes while nations angle for favorable treatment or deals from the administration.\n\nSince Trump has \u201cretained her foreign trademarks, the public will continue to have to ask whether President Trump has made foreign policy decisions in the interest of his and his family\u2019s businesses,\u201d CREW said.\n\nGranting the latest trademarks could be viewed as a way for China to curry favor with the Trump administration amid a trade war between the two nations.\n\nIn May, Ivanka Trump\u2019s business won approval for at least five Chinese trademarks just days before the president announced plans to help lift U.S. sanctions on China cellphone manufacturer ZTE. (Shortly before the president\u2019s statement, the developer of a theme park resort near Jakarta with a Trump licensing agreement also signed a deal for up to $500 million in Chinese government loans.)\n\nPresident Xi of China, and I, are working together to give massive Chinese phone company, ZTE, a way to get back into business, fast.

They include trademarks for shoes, wedding dresses, jewelry, nursing homes, sausage casing \u2014 and voting machines.\n\nMany of the Chinese trademarks she has obtained will be active until 2028, according to CREW.", "Democrats and Republicans have very different ideas about the issues defining the 2018 midterm elections.\n\nDemocratic voters are overwhelmingly focused on health care, according to HuffPost/YouGov polling taken throughout the summer and fall, while Republicans are most concerned with immigration. And those preferences closely mirror perceptions about what each party\u2019s candidates have focused on throughout the campaign.\n\nWhat Americans say matters most has fluctuated modestly throughout the year, with health care and immigration both being top issues. Concerns about immigration peaked during the debate over family separations in the summer and again in October as the president ramped up anti-immigration rhetoric during the closing days before the election. The share of voters who named the Supreme Court as a top issue dropped by half between a poll ending Oct. 2 and a subsequent one ending Oct. 23 (Justice Brett Kavanaugh was confirmed between the two).\n\nIn the most recent HuffPost/YouGov poll, 35 percent of voters named health care as among the issues most important to them, and 34 percent named immigration. The economy, at 26 percent, took third place, followed by gun policies at 15 percent, social issues at 11 percent, and both the Supreme Court and \u201cthe way things work in Washington\u201d at 10 percent. Seven other topics polled in single digits: the environment, Donald Trump\u2019s record as president, Trump\u2019s personality and character, tax reform, voting rights, foreign policy and infrastructure.\n\nBut results were sharply polarized. In the final survey before Election Day, 48 percent of voters who described themselves as Democrats or leaning toward the Democratic Party named health care as one of the two issues most important to them. Nothing else came remotely close \u2015 the next two issues, gun policies and the environment, scored just 16 percent each. Republican and Republican-leaning voters showed a similar gulf between their top concern and everything else: 60 percent named immigration as among their top issues, with 38 percent picking the economy and fewer than a quarter naming anything else.\n\nHuffPost\n\nThe midterms, as President Trump has acknowledged, will serve to some degree as a referendum on him personally \u2015 and other polling has found that he\u2019s taking up far more space in voters\u2019 minds than Barack Obama did in 2014. But 39 percent of voters said they wished candidates were talking less about Trump\u2019s personality and character, far outpacing the percentages of those who were tired of hearing about any other issue.\n\nHuffPost\n\nFully half of Democrats\u2019 campaign ads have been about health care, according to one analysis. Another look at ad spending found that health care was the most commonly mentioned topic in 45 percent of local media markets and that 1 in 5 Republican ads have mentioned immigration. The polling data show a voting public that\u2019s fairly tuned in with both parties\u2019 messaging. Very few, for instance, have the impression that the Republicans are campaigning on the environment or that Democrats are focusing on tax reform.\n\nIn the final HuffPost/YouGov survey, about half of voters said they\u2019d heard Democratic candidates in their state mentioning health care within the past week. Some 38 percent named it as among the party\u2019s top issues, putting it substantially ahead of messaging on Trump or anything else.\n\nHuffPost\n\nMeanwhile, 38 percent of voters said GOP candidates in their state were focused largely on immigration, with 27 percent naming the economy as a top issue and fewer than a quarter citing anything else.\n\nHuffPost\n\nThose perceptions have solidified throughout the campaign cycle as more voters have tuned in \u2015 and as the campaigns have honed their closing arguments.\n\nHuffPost\n\nAny survey aiming to measure voters\u2019 top concerns deserves a couple of caveats. For one thing, it matters how pollsters ask the questions and what options they provide. The HuffPost/YouGov survey, for instance, splits up Trump\u2019s behavior and his record into separate categories. Other pollsters have found somewhat different results, although focused on the same three issues: SurveyMonkey, which asks Americans to choose among seven issues including terrorism and education, has found economic concerns largely dominating the midterms, with health care a close second and immigration lagging behind. The Ipsos/Reuters tracking poll and Gallup\u2019s polling have both found health care, the economy and immigration forming a triumvirate of top concerns.\n\nFor another thing, what people mean when they talk about an issue is complicated. The Kaiser Family Foundation, which polls extensively on health care, notes that voters who cite it as a priority can be referencing anything from worries about health care costs to a desire for universal coverage to a wish to repeal the Affordable Care Act. And lastly, people simply aren\u2019t always that good at identifying the many factors that influence their ultimate decision to pick one candidate over another.\n\nBut what voters say they care most about, and how well they believe the parties are reflecting their priorities, can shed light on an election\u2019s dynamics. A HuffPost/YouGov poll taken just before Republicans\u2019 win in the 2014 midterms, for instance, found that voters saw the GOP as sharing their concerns about the economy and Democrats as more focused on social issues.\n\nThis year, the question of how well either party is reflecting voters\u2019 priorities is something of a wash. In the final HuffPost/YouGov survey of the race, voters are split 44 percent to 46 percent on whether or not Republicans in their state are doing well at addressing the issues and topics they care about. They\u2019re divided by a nearly identical 44 percent to 47 percent on whether or not the Democrats are doing well.\n\nUse the widget below to further explore the results of the HuffPost/YouGov survey, using the menu at the top to select survey questions and the buttons at the bottom to filter the data by subgroups:\n\nThe HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Oct. 30-31 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov\u2019s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.\n\nHuffPost has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

More details on the polls\u2019 methodology are available here.", "Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has joined a growing list of Interior Department officials who have committed seemingly clear violations of President Donald Trump\u2019s ethics pledge.\n\nThe embattled agency chief participated in discussions that involved his family foundation\u2019s land after stepping down as president of the group and pledging to recuse himself from such matters, according to documents obtained by The Washington Post.\n\nThe group, the Great Northern Veterans Peace Park Foundation, is involved in a development project in Zinke\u2019s hometown of Whitefish, Montana, that\u2019s backed by Halliburton Chairman David Lesar, as Politico first reported in June. Zinke and his wife could stand to benefit financially if the deal goes through. House Democrats later revealed that Zinke met with the project\u2019s developers in his government office last summer.\n\nZinke gave Whitefish city planner David Taylor permission to access the property, provided him with the combination for the gate and told him he was \u201cworking with\u201d project developers to accommodate a parking lot on the foundation\u2019s land, according to an August 2017 email exchange published by The Washington Post.\n\nThe ethics pledge Zinke signed in January 2017 prohibits him from participating \u201cpersonally and substantially in any particular matter\u201d involving the foundation for one year.\n\nThe real estate deal is at the center of Zinke\u2019s ethical troubles. Last week, the Interior Department\u2019s internal watchdog referred one of its ongoing probes into Zinke\u2019s conduct to the Department of Justice, indicating there may be grounds for a criminal investigation. The New York Times and other news outlets subsequently reported that the DOJ investigation will likely focus on Zinke\u2019s apparent ongoing involvement with the land deal.\n\nIn a separate email exchange in June 2018, Zinke and Taylor blasted Politico\u2019s initial report about Zinke\u2019s ties to the development.\n\n\u201cOnly fake news would make a mountain out of a sledding hill for kids,\u201d Zinke wrote. \u201cAs usual, the park is just trying to help whitefish on what appears to be a good project. I resigned right after i became secretary and lola is now president.\u201d Lola is Zinke\u2019s wife.\n\nKevin Lamarque / Reuters Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke may be at odds with President Trump's own ethics pledge.\n\nThere have been numerous instances of apparent conflicts of interest among top Interior Department officials, according to reporting by HuffPost and other news outlets.\n\nLast year, Lori Mashburn, the agency\u2019s White House liaison, attended two private events hosted by her former employer, the conservative Heritage Foundation, in a seemingly clear violation of federal ethics rules and the Trump pledge.\n\nBen Cassidy, a longtime lobbyist for the National Rifle Association who was appointed as the department\u2019s senior deputy director for intergovernmental and external affairs last year, participated in several agency meetings dealing with issues that he had lobbied Interior on while still with the NRA.\n\n\u201cEither he\u2019s violating it or the ethics pledge has no meaning,\u201d Virginia Canter, the chief ethics counsel at Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a government watchdog group based in Washington, D.C., said of Cassidy at the time.\n\nCassidy also appears to have played a sizable role in getting Zinke\u2019s International Wildlife Conservation Council off the ground. The 16-member council, which is tasked with advising Zinke about the benefits of international hunting, includes one of Cassidy\u2019s former NRA colleagues.\n\nThe ethics pledge bars appointees in the executive branch from participating \u201cin any particular matter involving specific parties that is directly and substantially related to my former employer or former clients.\u201d It also prohibits former lobbyists for two years from participating in any particular matters on which they lobbied in the two years prior to being appointed.\n\nAdditionally, Todd Wynn, Cassidy\u2019s boss and director of the agency\u2019s Office of Intergovernmental and External Affairs, repeatedly scheduled meetings with his former employers. And David Bernhardt, the agency\u2019s deputy secretary and a former lobbyist at the firm Brownstein Hyatt Farber & Schreck, has met with several lobbyists for MGM Resorts International, the casino-resort giant that\u2019s also represented by his longtime former firm.\n\nIn April, Bernhardt announced that the agency had hired two new ethics officials. In his letter to staff, he said that during his tenure there have been \u201cfar too many reports from the Office of Inspector General of specific instances where employees have made decisions that were unethical and in some cases illegal.\u201d The new hires, he added, were part of the agency\u2019s \u201creal commitment to make a meaningful contribution to incorporating the highest ethical standards.\u201d\n\nZinke has been the subject of at least 18 formal investigations \u2015 several of which are ongoing. Last month, the Office of Inspector General determined that Zinke had violated government travel policies by bringing his wife on taxpayer-funded trips.\n\nIn a statement to CNN last week, Zinke said of the DOJ probe: \u201cIt will be the same thing as all the other investigations \u2026 I follow all rules, procedures, regulations and, most importantly, the law. This is another politically driven investigation that has no merit.\u201d\n\nTrump told reporters on Monday that Zinke has \u201cdone a very good job\u201d but that he would \u201ctake a look\u201d at the allegations.", "Voters have taken to Twitter to share how they feel ahead of Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections compared to when they cast their ballot in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThe \u2018Me voting in 2016 vs. Me voting in 2018\u2019 meme has quickly exploded on the social media platform as Americans gear up to vote in the first nationwide elections of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\nBoy, what a difference two years can make.\n\nWe\u2019ve rounded up a few of the best ones:\n\nme voting in 2016 vs me voting in 2018 pic.twitter.com/sAI7foXM1V \u2014 Brian Scully is VOTING ON 11/6 (@brianscully) November 5, 2018\n\nMe voting in 2016 vs. me voting in 2018. pic.twitter.com/Qgvezg8hni \u2014 Sean Carroll (@seanmcarroll) November 6, 2018\n\nMe voting in 2016 vs me voting in 2018 pic.twitter.com/txbWHFrURe \u2014 \ud83c\udf0a John Bachir \ud83c\udf0a (@johnjoseph) November 6, 2018\n\nMe voting in 2016 Vs me voting in 2018. pic.twitter.com/FknC08KNYY \u2014 F\u2620\ufe0fzzie Scare (@Fozziebare) November 6, 2018\n\nvoting in 2016 vs. voting in 2018 pic.twitter.com/xvnBXpKV7m \u2014 The Late Late Show (@latelateshow) November 5, 2018\n\nVoting in 2016 vs. voting in 2018 pic.twitter.com/DwAdEwax8y \u2014 Late Night with Seth Meyers (@LateNightSeth) November 5, 2018\n\nMe voting in 2016 vs. Me if we don't vote in 2018 #VoteTuesday pic.twitter.com/HY4WJOuzrP \u2014 Whitney Friedlander (@loislane79) November 5, 2018\n\nMe as a non-citizen not being able to vote in 2016 VS me as a citizen voting in my first election in 2018 pic.twitter.com/QHEoQm0qiW \u2014 Solomon Georgio (@solomongeorgio) November 5, 2018\n\nMe voting in 2016 vs me voting in 2018 pic.twitter.com/wM8l1uGvLe \u2014 Jennifer Reitman (@JenniferReitman) November 5, 2018\n\nMe voting in 2016 vs. Me voting in 2018 pic.twitter.com/qLY45OtjJn \u2014 Ron DelVillano (@rdelvillano) November 6, 2018\n\nMe voting in 2016 vs. me in 2018: pic.twitter.com/NZ8G2JwiXv \u2014 Ulysses Bloomsday (@BloomsdayDevice) November 6, 2018\n\nMe voting in 2016 vs\n\nMe voting in 2018 pic.twitter.com/ewkGP5rRD0 \u2014 meh (@mharvey816) November 6, 2018\n\nMe voting in 2016 vs Me voting in 2018 pic.twitter.com/F02naBljxW \u2014 Jessica Valenti (@JessicaValenti) November 5, 2018\n\nMe voting in 2016 vs me voting in 2018.#ElectionDay pic.twitter.com/WkotWHcgiz \u2014 Jerry James Stone (@jerryjamesstone) November 5, 2018\n\nMy contribution to me voting in 2016 VS me voting in 2018 #midterms2018 #Election2018 pic.twitter.com/oB6qkQ3Lda \u2014 Gretchen (@GretchenIsFunny) November 5, 2018\n\nMe voting in 2016 vs. me voting in 2018 pic.twitter.com/dp4qXcO8Hd \u2014 Megan Amram (@meganamram) November 5, 2018", "Rep.

But John Chhan didn\u2019t want to accept charity. So they found another way.\n\nChhan, 62, and his wife, Stella, 63, migrated to California in 1979 as refugees from Cambodia, KCAL reported. They\u2019ve run the doughnut shop for three decades, working side by side every morning \u2015 until Stella suffered a brain aneurysm.\n\nRealizing that the most important thing for the Chhans was to spend as much time as possible together, the customers spread the word that instead of buying one doughnut at a time, they should buy them by the dozen.

So Idra Novey\u2019s sophomore novel, Those Who Knew, about a corrupt and misogynistic progressive senator in an unnamed \u201cisland nation,\u201d happens to hit bookstores on the same day as Americans flood to the polls for the first midterm election under President Donald Trump. It\u2019s fitting.\n\nThe novel\u2019s promotional copy (not to mention my own Most Anticipated blurb) emphasized the book\u2019s timeliness in relation to the Me Too movement of the past year. (Of course, Those Who Knew is not a response to this movement; Novey had finished a draft when the Harvey Weinstein revelations broke last October.) But the novel doesn\u2019t tell the story we\u2019ve since come to expect of that genre: of a triumphant dethroning, a woman\u2019s words finally being heeded and a man\u2019s crimes at last being held to account.\n\nInstead, it\u2019s the Election Day timing of its U.S. publication that turns out to be most felicitous. In Those Who Knew, civic engagement \u2015 activism, political reporting, running for office and voting \u2015 makes things happen. Imperfectly and intermittently, but more so than any deus ex machina or reckless hero, the practical work of government participation fuels a struggle toward justice.\n\nIdra Novey\u2019s second novel opens in the unnamed island nation shortly after a young woman who had been romantically entangled with a popular young senator died under the wheels of a bus. The death of Maria P., a student activist, is quickly ruled an accident, but Lena, a professor at the local liberal arts college, has other suspicions. She\u2019d had a romance with Victor, the senator, back in their own student activist days \u2015 and, like Maria\u2019s, hers had ended violently. She has no trouble believing that Victor pushed Maria in front of that bus.\n\nLena\u2019s friend Olga, an older woman who owns a political bookstore called Seek the Sublime or Die, wants her to leave well enough alone. \u201cYou just have a hunch,\u201d Olga tells Lena, \u201cand he has the backing of the entire Truth and Justice Party.\u201d Olga knows of what she speaks; once a headstrong revolutionary, she\u2019s spent decades quietly mourning the slaying of her lover by the previous U.S.-backed regime. But Lena is haunted, both by her own memories and by what she believes are signs from the afterlife: An unfamiliar black sweater, which resembles Maria\u2019s obituary photo outfit, keeps showing up in her bag; a white satin bra she\u2019s never seen before appears in her lingerie drawer.\n\nMeanwhile, Victor is chugging steadily along in a life he\u2019s relieved has not been derailed by Maria\u2019s death. He\u2019s recently begun sleeping with the blandly polished daughter of a powerful politician in his party, and he impulsively proposes to her. Soon, the wedding planning underway, his future father-in-law reaches out to ask for a small favor for a friend, a pig farmer who needs a permit to raise more pigs. More pigs would mean more pig feces to dispose of, and, he muses, \u201cWhat political favors were not ultimately about pig shit and how to get rid of it?\u201d Victor makes a call to a cousin in the Agriculture Department; consultant fees and political donations grease the wheels.\n\nDespite the hum in the air that promises imminent confrontation \u2015 not just from Lena, who feels by turns like she\u2019s been ordained to avenge Maria and like she\u2019s going insane, but also from playwright Freddy, who harbors doubts about his older brother Victor\u2019s innocence \u2015 time simply passes. Lena finds out she\u2019s pregnant after her short-lived affair with a striking blond American, Oscar. She has a blond son and moves to a city resembling New York for graduate school. Victor\u2019s marriage takes place, then begins to fray. His pig shit problem has metastasized.\n\nStill, he remains a hero to progressive activists, the one senator willing to push for students\u2019 rights and tuition reform. If he\u2019s going to be brought down from such a lofty perch, it\u2019s going to take more than a solitary woman pointing a finger. Especially if that woman is Lena.\n\nThroughout the book, Novey is particularly insightful about the innumerable tangled threads of power that hold society in fragile balance. Lena is a woman but also the daughter of a wealthy, conservative family that backed the oppressive regime that killed Olga\u2019s lover. When they were together, Victor handily manipulated her class guilt and her awareness of her privilege to extract sex and compliance from her. Now that the Truth and Justice Party has taken power, this legacy has become a liability, a reason to discount her accusations. And yet it is still a privilege. She has the resources from her family to flee the country or to send her fair-haired son to private school when other children taunt him as \u201cTourist Face.\u201d\n\nNovey\u2019s characters are forever picking at their privileges, seeing them not simply as rhetorical admissions but as dangerous things, knives they might accidentally cut someone with. Olga still burns with remorse remembering how she urged her Jewish lover to join her at a dangerous rally, not accounting for how an identifiably Semitic surname would translate into a target. Victor\u2019s seductive masculinity can easily be turned against his wife, Cristina, but so can her political connections be leveraged to destroy him. In Oscar, Those Who Knew deals out sharp jabs to complacent American liberals who can\u2019t be bothered to learn the history of U.S.-sponsored fascists in countries they can be bothered to visit as tourists.\n\nThose Who Knew, though buoyed by a certain optimism, doesn\u2019t traffic in idealism about the political tools at hand \u2015 how could it, given the island\u2019s history of elections rigged with U.S. aid? When the levers of justice finally begin to move, it\u2019s a combination of privilege and expediency that holds the power to dislodge Victor, an exploitation of the existing government\u2019s predilections to bring an imperfect retribution to an imperfect villain.\n\nToppling a flawed progressive champion is not without costs to the broader agenda, like the free tuition legislation he had backed. Novey probes deeper than that loss, however, threading through a poignant, persistent acknowledgment of how Victor\u2019s violence bled the movement of young female talent. Even Lena, a politically engaged woman, squirms with the knowledge that her students will question her activism because she avoids rallies where Victor will make an appearance.\n\nIn Jill Soloway\u2019s new memoir, She Wants It, Soloway notoriously crows of the Me Too wave, \u201cTwo years after I\u2019d yelled \u2018Topple the patriarchy!\u2019 onstage, it all indeed came tumbling down.\u201d In Naomi Alderman\u2019s The Power, a novel released in the U.S. about a year ago, she envisioned what that would actually mean: A complete reversal of physical power between the sexes, followed by political, social and cultural power, which utterly destabilizes the reigning hegemony. Me Too has seen moments of accountability for a relatively tiny number of famous men, but the forces of patriarchy remain in control and in fact have organized to defend themselves.\n\nNovey\u2019s novel imagines a more incremental, more grounded type of toppling: An excruciatingly slow, sometimes sordid grind toward accountability and inclusive governance. Showing up, in whatever way possible, as consistently as possible is not a panacea but is nonetheless vital.\n\nThose Who Knew is a novel about a muddy slog for justice, which makes its actual form rather surprising: It covers six years and alternates among perspectives \u2015 Lena, Olga, Victor, Freddy, Cristina \u2015 but is just around 250 pages. A slender novel needn\u2019t be an insubstantial one, and Novey certainly packs hers with weighty themes, but I couldn\u2019t help but feel they might have been better served by a more patient, deliberate exploration.\n\nThroughout the novel, Novey is prone to collapsing scenes that might have blossomed out into comic or shocking action, instead whisking through them with serviceable exposition. Take Lena and Olga\u2019s inside joke of cosplaying revolutionaries in painted cotton-ball beards, imagining themselves into politically powerful roles typically reserved for men by donning male facial hair. Novey seems satisfied once she\u2019s conveyed this, rather than relaxing into the characters; the scene almost immediately vanishes into neat summary: \u201cSoon, they were both up and shouting over each other about justice and a beard-for-everyone movement that would spread from bookstores to revolutionary all-night libraries.\u201d I longed for Novey to extract more from the scene, and others like it \u2015 more humor, more insight, more sense of this compelling pair of friends.\n\nVictor\u2019s perspective, which could be particularly revealing, instead offers the mushiest interludes. To convey his warped worldview in just a couple of pages here and there, Novey frequently slips into on-the-nose meditations that diagnose his pathology as bluntly as any Me Too think piece might. Remembering how he\u2019d grabbed Lena\u2019s wrist when she tried to confront him about Maria at a theater, he muses that \u201cgrabbing a woman\u2019s wrist for a second couldn\u2019t implicate a man. It was the sort of transgression that, if mentioned as proof of anything, would sound exaggerated, oversensitive\u2026. and hadn\u2019t she asked for it, marching so righteously across the lobby with that dilettante bitterness of hers, with her deceptively delicate-looking mouth?\u201d\n\nMost tantalizing, to me, were the hints of fantasy that surface here and there, never seeming to come to anything. The sweater and bra Lena believes are signs from Maria, a ghostly stain she finds on her jacket, a run-in with a familiar-looking woman who introduces herself as Maria \u2015 Novey invites us to interpret them as spiritual visitations, as figments of Lena\u2019s imagination or as symptoms of the trauma she\u2019s suffered. As in her debut, Ways to Disappear, Novey adeptly constructs uncanny moments like these, and they account for some of the most gripping passages in the novel.\n\nBut somehow they come to feel insubstantial. Like the news clippings and fliers sprinkled through the narrative, these bewildering visions feel as though they could be cleanly excised from the rest of it. It\u2019s a flurry of technique and form, much of it exquisitely done, but not given quite enough ground to settle on.", "Chris McGonigal/HuffPost Arleen Sevilla poses for a photo while canvassing in the Chickasaw Woods subdivision in Orlando, Florida, on Oct. 30, 2018.\n\nORLANDO, Fla. \u2015 Arleen Sevilla moved swiftly from house to house. With a stack of mail-in ballot request forms in one arm, she used the tablet in her hand to identify homes in the area where registered Latino voters live.\n\nAfter almost three months without power and water in their hometown of Manat\u00ed, Puerto Rico, the former pastry chef and her family were able to buy plane tickets and relocate to Altamonte Springs, a suburban city in North Orlando. They spent two months living in a hotel, with the help of FEMA, and moved into an apartment of their own once the aid ran out.\n\nSince then, they\u2019ve struggled to adapt. Sevilla and her son, who has autism, don\u2019t speak English, and the family says they\u2019ve faced discrimination from people who accuse them of wanting to live off the government. Sevilla and her husband grow particularly upset when people, President Donald Trump included, praise hurricane relief efforts in Puerto Rico.\n\n\u201cHe did do something: He threw toilet paper at us as if we were crap,\u201d she said of Trump. \u201cIt makes me angry because there are so many lies that they\u2019re telling and people really believe they helped Puerto Rico.\u201d\n\nSo when a fellow Maria survivor told Sevilla about Vamos4PR, she was eager to join their ranks, despite never having been involved in politics in Puerto Rico.\n\nChris McGonigal/HuffPost Arleen Sevilla walks by a house with signs supporting Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) while canvassing in Orlando.\n\nPuerto Ricans\u2019 political power is growing in central Florida, becoming an emerging political force since the island\u2019s economic crisis sparked an exodus from Puerto Rico to the U.S. mainland more than a decade ago.\n\nMost of the Latinos that Vamos4PR targets are unlike Sevilla \u2015 longtime U.S. residents who are already registered as either Democrats or independents, but who may not have voted in previous elections.\n\nThe organization is endorsing Democratic candidates \u2015 Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum for governor and incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson, whose seat is being challenged by the state\u2019s current governor, Gov. Rick Scott (R). Though canvassers talk about candidates\u2019 stances on a variety of issues \u2015 including universal health care and raising the minimum wage \u2015 Hurricane Maria, and Trump\u2019s response to it, comes up frequently.\n\nHurricane Maria represents an important political event for this voting bloc, which is largely unhappy with the federal government\u2019s response to the storm and has found ways to mobilize in its aftermath.\n\n\u201cI usually don\u2019t vote at all, this is the first time in many years,\u201d said Pablo Gelabert. The 43-year-old Puerto Rican native has lived in Florida for more than 20 years and had already gone to vote by the time Sevilla knocked on his door. \u201cI have never cared as much as I do right now.\u201d\n\nChris McGonigal/HuffPost Pablo Gelabert stands outside his home in Orlando on Oct. 30, 2018.\n\nGelabert has no family left on the island, but told Sevilla the federal response to Hurricane Maria was \u201cterrible\u201d and that it\u2019s one of the many reasons he supports candidates that are \u201cthe complete opposite of Trump.\u201d\n\nRecent arrivals, by contrast, are not as mobilized to vote and require a more fundamental education on how the political system works in the mainland U.S. On the island, Puerto Ricans can only vote in local elections \u2015 which revolve around a multi-party political system \u2015 and despite being U.S. citizens, they are unable to vote in either presidential or midterm elections unless they reside on the mainland.\n\n\u201cThe focus has tended to be: \u2018Oh, Puerto Ricans are moving from Puerto Rico to the United States. They are U.S. citizens. They can register to vote automatically,\u2019\u201d said Carlos Vargas-Ramos, political scientist and research associate at the City University of New York\u2019s Center for Puerto Rican Studies.\n\n\u201cYes, that is true, in theory. In practice, we know that for the people who were displaced by the storm, voting is not going to be a priority. The first order of priority is going to be to secure housing, and to secure a job to pay for that housing.\u201d\n\nInstead, Vargas-Ramos said, political science research indicates the longer someone has lived in a particular community the more likely they are to turn up to vote.\n\nThe good news for Democrats is that the Puerto Rican diaspora in Florida has been growing since deteriorating economic conditions on the island sparked a mass migration in 2006 \u2015 and when Puerto Rican voters show up, they tend to go Democratic.\n\nI usually don\u2019t vote at all; this is the first time in many years. I have never cared as much as I do right now. Pablo Gelabert, 43\n\n\u201cThe raw impact of the Puerto Rican vote in central Florida is significant,\u201d according to Steve Schale, a Tallahassee-based political strategist and Barack Obama\u2019s state director in 2008.\n\n\u201cIf you go back to just the 2006 midterm election, the counties that make up the Orlando metropolitan area voted overwhelmingly Republican. Today those counties make up very much the core of the Democratic base in Florida, and it\u2019s a function largely of that Puerto Rican population.\u201d\n\nEdwin Mel\u00e9ndez, director of CUNY\u2019s Center for Puerto Rican Studies, told HuffPost he estimates that in the year after Hurricane Maria, between 67,000 to 73,000 survivors joined the more than 1 million Puerto Ricans already living in Florida. Most of them relocated to central Florida counties like Orange and Osceola where the Puerto Rican population is concentrated.\n\n\n\nVoter registration data in Florida doesn\u2019t include a breakdown of voters by origin, but a recent Pew Research Center study found that Latino registered voters in the state increased by 6.2 percent since the 2016 presidential election. More telling is that registration numbers for Latinos grew fastest in 14 of the 18 Florida counties with the largest Puerto Rican populations.\n\nChris McGonigal/HuffPost Canvassers working with Vamos4PR participate in a training exercise on how to approach people at their homes.\n\nVargas-Ramos estimates that based on census data, Puerto Ricans currently make up about 5.4 percent of the eligible voting population in Florida.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a huge number, but in a race that is very tight, 5 percent may make a big difference at election time,\u201d he said.\n\nEarly voting data suggests that Latino turnout is higher in Florida this election, according to Schale. As of Monday, there were more early votes by Latinos compared to the same period four years ago. Out of the 1 million voters who\u2019ve already voted in this election but didn\u2019t in the last midterm, 18 percent are Latino, Schale added.\n\n\u201cThat says to me that the Hispanic population is bigger but also that turnout is probably a little bit better,\u201d Schale said, adding that there\u2019s been greater turnout among Latinos and Democrats in areas where Puerto Ricans abound. \u201cI think there\u2019s reason to believe turnout among Puerto Ricans is going to be higher than it was four years ago, and there\u2019s a reason to believe that that\u2019s a very good thing for my party.\u201d\n\nBut Alex Patton, a Gainesville-based Republican campaign consultant, told HuffPost that an uptick in early voting numbers could merely be a sign of enthusiasm and holds little predictive power.\n\n\u201cHistorically, [Latinos] are an unreliable voting bloc in midterm elections,\u201d he said. \u201cI guess the 5 million dollar question is: Do recent events, in the last six months, change that? And we\u2019re getting ready to find out.\u201d\n\nCollaboration Born Out Of Despair\n\nThe federal response to Hurricane Maria continues to be a sore subject for Puerto Ricans in the diaspora. Marcos Vilar, executive director of Alianza for Progress, a political organization working to mobilize Latinos in central Florida, pointed to a series of focus groups the polling firm Latino Decisions conducted in May.\n\nThe report included commentary from long-term residents and recent arrivals and found that the diaspora largely considered the Trump administration\u2019s hurricane relief efforts to be \u201cinadequate at best, and willful neglect at worst.\u201d The participants also said they felt disrespected and forgotten by federal politicians in Maria\u2019s aftermath.\n\nFlorida Senate candidates Scott and Nelson have appealed to Puerto Rican voters by reminding them of their efforts post-Maria. Scott, for example, offered advice and assistance to the island\u2019s Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA), which struggled to restore power to residents on the island for months. Meanwhile, Nelson worked to advocate for additional aid for both the island and to Puerto Ricans displaced by the storm.\n\nChris McGonigal/HuffPost An information sheet showing political candidates in Florida.\n\nSchale and Vargas-Ramos said there\u2019s no question that Hurricane Maria was key for Puerto Ricans in the run-up to the midterm elections \u2015 both in influencing how they feel about the federal government and how they mobilize.\n\n\u201cThe Puerto Ricans that I do expect to be highly motivated and likely to turn out to vote in this election are the Puerto Ricans that mobilized themselves [in the mainland] to assist those who were displaced by the storm whether in Puerto Rico or in the United States,\u201d Vargas-Ramos said.\n\n\u201cThey banded together and worked collectively to address the situation with Puerto Ricans in Puerto Rico and the United States,\u201d he continued, adding that they found both the federal and local response \u201cinsufficient\u201d and that \u201cmany of them are likely to vote to express their opinion about what the governmental response was like.\u201d\n\nEven before the election cycle began, the Trump administration\u2019s feeble hurricane relief efforts in Puerto Rico had mobilized the diaspora to act and help the island.\n\n\u201cImmediately after the hurricane, people here started collecting goods and money and resources to send to the island, and networks were born out of that effort,\u201d Vilar said. \u201cPeople in Tampa, Orlando, Miami, Jacksonville, Tallahassee discovered each other, bonded and created relationships that sort of launched us into the election.\u201d\n\nImmediately after the hurricane ... People in Tampa, Orlando, Miami, Jacksonville, Tallahassee discovered each other, bonded and created relationships that sort of launched us into the election. Marcos Vilar, executive director of Alianza for Progress\n\nIn the small, baby-blue house in downtown Kissimmee that serves as Alianza\u2019s headquarters, Puerto Rican flags hang on the wall next to maps of the Osceola County voting district and signs featuring a coqu\u00ed frog holding a megaphone next to the words \u201cRespeta Mi Gente\u201d (Respect My People) \u2015 a campaign the group began earlier this year to rally Puerto Ricans and Latinos overall during the electoral cycle.\n\nIt\u2019s under this campaign that about 10 Latino-led organizations, many with Puerto Rican roots like Vamos4PR, are working to reach registered Latino voters and incentivize them to make it to the ballot box. With the help of its partners, the group intended to visit 110,000 central Florida homes three times before Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIf we as [Puerto Rican] progressives are not lifting our part, we are hurting the progressive cause, we are hurting other people that need the same things that we need,\u201d Vilar added. \u201cThis way people can say \u2018Puerto Ricans came to Orlando and they made a difference.\u2019\u201d\n\nCarolina Moreno/HuffPost Inside the headquarters of Alianza for Progress in Kissimmee, Florida.\n\nA Vote For The Island\n\nPuerto Ricans are also hoping their votes will help their home island. Wanda Ramos, co-founder of Vamos4PR, told HuffPost the group\u2019s mobilization efforts have not only focused on explaining how the mainland political system works, but also how new arrivals can help the island\u2019s reconstruction efforts by voting.\n\n\u201cIn Puerto Rico, we don\u2019t really have representation on the federal level,\u201d Ramos said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have elected officials that have the power to vote to be able to help us. So we have to make the effort to reach those people to create change for the island.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s something that weighs on Sevilla and her husband as well. The couple, who will mark their one-year anniversary in Florida on Tuesday, still have a lot of family left on the island and they\u2019re eager to help any way they can.\n\n\u201cNow we have a vote and what we do counts, so we are gonna make the difference,\u201d said Javier Figueroa, Sevilla\u2019s husband. \u201cI don\u2019t like politics, but anything that I can do here that can potentially benefit Puerto Rico, Puerto Rico can count on me. And everything that\u2019s going to benefit all of us Latino brothers and sisters, they can all count on Puerto Rico to support them.\u201d", "Sen.

The group of mostly northwestern, working-class neo-Nazis \u2015 who would come to be known as the Order or the Silent Brotherhood \u2015 swore \u201cto do whatever it is necessary to deliver our people from the Jew and bring total victory to the Aryan race.\u201d\n\nAs historian Kathleen Belew writes in her 2018 book, Bring The War Home: The White Power Movement and Paramilitary in America, these men were committed to \u201cprotecting and propagating the white race.\u201d After a string of armed robberies of banks and businesses that they considered degenerate, the group fixated on Jewish talk radio host Alan Berg. One of the members had clashed with Berg on air and later called him a \u201cfilthy Jew.\u201d On June 18, 1984, members of the Order drove to Berg\u2019s home in Denver and gunman Bruce Pierce fired 13 bullets into Berg, killing him instantly. It was the group\u2019s first \u2015 and only \u2015 assassination in pursuit of their goal of establishing a white separatist homeland in the United States.\n\nTo those unfamiliar with white supremacist ideology and rhetoric, it may seem surprising that such a group would choose a Jewish man as their first target. After all, the Order was most concerned with the purity of the white race, which is why its members abhorred interracial marriage and procreation. Yet according to the Order \u2015 and to the white supremacist groups that have inherited its ideology \u2015 Jews are the principal enemy of white supremacy.\n\nAccording to the Order \u2015 and to the white supremacist groups that have inherited its ideology \u2015 Jews are the principal enemy of white supremacy.\n\nMembers of the Order embraced a conspiracy theory that the U.S. government was in thrall to a Jewish organization dubbed the Zionist Occupation Government. As Belew explains, they believed that ZOG sought to \u201cadmit immigrants \u2026 allow black men to rape white women, and encourage interracial marriages \u2015 all this, they said, to destroy the white race.\u201d\n\nThirty-four years after Berg\u2019s murder, white supremacists remain no less fixated on Jews as the puppet masters. On the far-right Internet, conspiracy theories fester, and Jews return again and again to the fore. On the message boards 4chan and 8chan, on the neo-Nazi website Daily Stormer, on the white supremacist message board Stormfront.org, the insistence that Jews control the U.S. government, as well as the media and world economic systems, is a recurrent theme, a dark absolute pulsing through a sea of violent rhetoric.\n\nThis week\u2019s midterm elections are unfolding little more than a week after the deadliest attack on Jews in the history of the United States, a massacre at Pittsburgh\u2019s Tree of Life synagogue that claimed 11 lives. The shooter, Robert Bowers, was inspired by white supremacist rhetoric that continues to assert that Jews are scheming to destroy the white race from within. But since the 1980s, this paranoia about the \u201cdilution\u201d of the white race has shifted from an obsession with interracial marriage to a fixation on immigration. Bowers\u2019 final post on the far-right social media network Gab blamed HIAS, a charity formerly known as the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, for bringing in \u201cinvaders\u201d in the form of a caravan of migrants currently wending its way from Central America toward the U.S. border.\n\nALFREDO ESTRELLA via Getty Images Central American migrants, part of a caravan heading to the U.S., rest at a temporary shelter set up in a Mexico City stadium on Nov. 5, 2018.\n\nThe language of \u201cinvasion\u201d \u2015 and of a sinister Jewish conspiracy \u2015 has been echoed in the Republican Party\u2019s full-throated, baying offensive against immigration. The closing argument Republicans have offered before Election Day is a dark screed against non-white immigration and against Jewish philanthropist George Soros, who multiple Republican elected representatives have posited, without evidence, is funding the migrant caravan.\n\nEven white supremacists agree that the GOP\u2019s campaign echoes their principles. In a recent post, Bradley Griffin, author of the white nationalist blog Occidental Dissent and a prominent member of the neo-Confederate hate group League of the South, put it succinctly: \u201cThe GOP is campaigning on White Nationalism.\u201d Griffin and his fellow white supremacists have been emboldened by the ascension of President Donald Trump. In his rhetoric and policies, they hear their own fixations broadcast from a presidential perch.\n\nTime and again, in the overheated confines of this election cycle, Republican candidates have found themselves fighting shoulder-to-shoulder with white supremacists \u2015 from Kansas gubernatorial candidate Kris Kobach, a militantly anti-voting rights official who has accepted thousands of dollars in donations from white nationalists, to Virginia senatorial candidate Corey Stewart, whose campaign has been staffed and bolstered by white supremacists. Across the country, from California to Illinois, candidates have run for office on the Republican ticket while issuing statements that once might have been relegated to the fringe. Last year, Patrick Little, an anti-Semitic extremist, bid for the U.S. Senate in California on a platform seeking to \u201cName the Jew,\u201d a white supremacist term for exposing the supposed machinations of Jewish influence. He garnered more than 50,000 votes in a large primary field.\n\nThe GOP is campaigning on White Nationalism. Bradley Griffin of the neo-Confederate hate group League of the South\n\nDespite the undeniable violence of white supremacists\u2019 goals \u2015 many today seek to create a \u201cwhite ethnostate\u201d purged of minorities by violent means, just as the Order did \u2015 their ascendance has caught law enforcement largely by surprise.\n\nAt both the federal and local levels, law enforcement has failed to take far-right violence seriously, often minimizing its impact while focusing on social-justice-oriented leftist groups. Sometimes the sympathies of individual officers lie all too clearly with the white supremacists. The Washington Post reported recently on an archetypal case in Arkansas: a policeman who attended a Ku Klux Klan meeting and who persistently engaged in violent misconduct against people of color, culminating in the shooting death of a 15-year-old black child. Such sympathies are not shared by all officers, by any means, but it is clear that a certain willful blindness to violence on the far-right has hampered the pursuit of domestic terrorists.\n\nIn such times, it can be tempting to feel hopeless, to hold one\u2019s loved ones close and renew one\u2019s passport in anticipation of potential flight. For many American Jews, who are a tiny minority of the U.S. population, our position seems to be one of profound precariousness. Yet in the face of that, many young Jewish activists are standing up to declare their opposition to white supremacy: from protesters who gathered at Manhattan\u2019s Metropolitan Republican Club to rebuke white nationalism, to young Jews who greeted Trump\u2019s visit to Pittsburgh by moving the intimate mourning ritual of shiva to the public square.\n\nOn Tuesday, Americans face a complex set of choices among those who seek to represent them, but one aspect of the election could not be simpler. As the GOP embraces its extremists, the ballot box offers a rare chance to soundly reject anti-Semitism and white supremacy.", "KEREM YUCEL via Getty Images Ilhan Omar, a Muslim Somali-American running for Minnesota\u2019s 5th Congressional District, campaigns at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis on Nov. 2. An October report from Muslim Advocates found dozens of candidates nationwide who ran on anti-Muslim platforms.\n\nAisha Yaqoob is American Muslim hijab-wearing woman who is the 2018 Democratic candidate for the 97th District in the Georgia House of Representatives. The daughter of immigrants, Yaqoob, 25, is one of the nearly 90 Muslims running for public office nationwide. But facing that unprecedented number of Muslim candidates running in the midterms are perhaps the most Islamophobic U.S. elections ever. She is one of those candidates who face such hate, particularly on her social media pages.\n\nThe Islamophobic harassment, however, wasn\u2019t always such a pressing concern. Only after her photo and social media pages were posted on a right-wing website this year did the wave of Islamophobic hate came crashing in.\n\nBut the hateful comments didn\u2019t have anything to do with Yaqoob\u2019s stances on the issues she promoted, she said; rather, they always referred to her faith and racial identity. The online critics told her to go back to her country and accused her of bringing Sharia, or Islamic law, to the United States.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not even about my platforms. It\u2019s literally just about who I am,\u201d she told HuffPost. \u201c[My campaign] had to spend a lot of time and a lot of money, frankly, just making sure that people knew who I was before we even got the chance to start to talk about issues or ask for their vote.\u201d\n\nThe use of anti-Muslim bigotry in political campaigns is not new, but new research by the Information Disorder Lab at the Harvard Kennedy School\u2019s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy released last week outlined the various propaganda tactics right-wing websites and activists utilized to target and smear Muslim candidates.\n\nThe goals of such campaigns is to primarily see Muslim candidates lose their elections, said Stefanie Le, a researcher at IDLab. These right-wing websites are doing so by \u201cotherizing these candidates\u201d and \u201cappealing to the fears that have been stoked in the political climate,\u201d she added.\n\nThe findings list the five most common tactics used to target Muslim candidates in 2018 races. The most common tactic recorded by the research center was falsely accusing Muslim candidates of having ties to terrorism and extremism. One such example can be found in Minnesota, where Muslim Democratic candidate Ilhan Omar is running for Minnesota\u2019s 5th Congressional District.\n\nIn her heavily Democratic district, Omar, a former Somali refugee, is poised to be one of the first Muslim women and the first Somali-American in Congress. Muslims currently hold only two of the 535 seats in Congress.\n\nDespite her qualifications and like Yaqoob, Omar is constantly attacked on various websites, including in her district, where local GOP members set up a site and leveled a litany of false accusations against her. The site called her dangerous, accused her of aiding terrorists and said she broke immigration laws \u2015 allegations that she has denied and that various media investigations have disproved.\n\nThe report also lists other tactics used to target Muslim candidates, such as coordinating smear campaigns, exaggerating \u201cscandals\u201d involving Muslim candidates that are then echoed on conservative news sites and social media channels, and guilt by association, which targets non-Muslim candidates who work alongside Muslim candidates.", "President Donald Trump said he wanted to call his daughter Ivanka \u201cbeautiful\u201d during a rally Monday in Cleveland, but was miffed he had to settle for \u201creally smart.\u201d\n\nThe president was introducing his daughter to the crowd when he went off on \u2015 spoiler alert! \u2015 a bizarre tangent.\n\n\u201cNow I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll say this is nepotism, but the truth is she\u2019s a very, very \u2014 you\u2019re not allowed to use the word \u2018beautiful\u2019 anymore when you talk about women, you\u2019re not allowed, no, no, it\u2019s politically incorrect,\u201d he said, according to Newsweek.\n\nAlthough politically correct is the last thing anyone would call Trump, the president then said he\u2019d never compliment a woman\u2019s looks ever again \u2015 and tried to get the crowd to join him.\n\n\u201cI will never call a woman beautiful again, and every man here, every man here, raise your hand, you will never say your wife, your girlfriend, anybody is beautiful, right?\u201d\n\nThe crowd booed, inspiring the president to get back to the introduction.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not allowed to say, because it\u2019s my daughter Ivanka, but she\u2019s really smart,\u201d the president said. \u201cAnd she\u2019s here, shall I bring her up?\u201d\n\nWhile introducing Ivanka Trump, Pres.

We are building plans to do just that.\u201d\n\nAccording to Hirshland, protocol dictates that a review panel will now need to be convened to conduct a hearing on the matter and give recommendations on a course of action.\n\nA vote by the USOC board will then determine whether USAG is officially stripped of its status.\n\nThe move comes as USAG has struggled to find improved leadership following a sexual abuse scandal involving former trainer Larry Nassar, who is currently serving a life sentence on child sexual abuse and child pornography charges.\n\nIn October, the organization\u2019s interim president and CEO, Mary Bono, announced that she was leaving her post after only five days in the role.

But, in the process, he ends up being overly protective of Eddie.\n\nAt one point, Louis pulls over to help a family whose car had overheated. When a police officer pulls up, he assumes Louis is at fault for the family\u2019s car troubles and makes \u201cbad Asian driver\u201d jokes.\n\nLet's be real.

Research shows that Asians are actually the best drivers. The National Center for Statistics and Analysis looked at race and ethnicity in 2006 traffic safety data. The figures revealed that Asians have the lowest fatality rates. Asians also had the highest rate of safety belt use.\n\nAnd in a move that really should\u2019ve ended the trope once and for all, Takuma Sato of Japan won the Indy 500 last year.\n\nYet somehow, the idea of the bad Asian driver continues to circulate in popular culture. There\u2019s even this extremely thorough definition of \u201cAsian driver\u201d on Urban Dictionary that manages to pull several stereotypical traits into one entry.\n\nSo, FYI, this is really not an accurate representation of Asian drivers.", "ASSOCIATED PRESS President Donald Trump bows his head as pastor Paula White leads the room in prayer during a dinner for evangelical leaders in the State Dining Room of the White House on Aug. 27, 2018.\n\nA new study has unearthed several telling facts about what white evangelical Protestants really think about America\u2019s growing diversity.\n\nThe findings, published last Monday by the Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI), suggest many white evangelicals don\u2019t see eye to eye with Protestants of color on issues concerning race, immigration and President Donald Trump\u2019s effect on white supremacists.\n\nThis racial gap could have lasting repercussions as American evangelicalism becomes more diverse.\n\nPRRI found that unlike members of any other major religious group, most white evangelicals said immigrants represented a threat to America\u2019s customs and values. Fifty-seven percent said that immigrants threatened American society, while 43 percent said immigrants strengthened American society.\n\nProtestants of color expressed much greater support for immigrants. About 63 percent of Hispanic Protestants and 67 percent of black Protestants said that immigrants strengthened American society.\n\nNikki Toyama-Szeto, executive director of the progressive Christian group Evangelicals for Social Action, told HuffPost she believes the Bible consistently calls Christians to welcome strangers and extend hospitality to foreigners. She suspects some white evangelicals aren\u2019t reaching the same conclusion because they aren\u2019t aware of \u201chow close their own immigration stories are.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith the exception of first nations people and enslaved African Americans, everyone else immigrated or sought asylum in this country,\u201d Toyama-Szeto wrote to HuffPost. \u201c[Many white evangelicals] are not aware of the circumstances of Grandpa Joe, and how their family stories might be very similar to the stories that are being played out in the news.\n\nPRRI\u2019s survey was conducted among a random sample of 2,509 adults in all 50 states and Washington, D.C., online and by telephone, between Sept. 17 and Oct. 1.\n\nWhile statistics about white evangelical Protestants are easy to find, it\u2019s harder to pull out data about evangelicals of color. PRRI and other research groups identify evangelical Christians by asking respondents if they describe themselves as \u201cborn-again\u201d or \u201cevangelical Christian.\u201d This question helps researchers separate out white evangelical Protestants as a religious group. PRRI CEO Robert Jones told HuffPost that this reflects how white evangelicals and white mainline Protestants distinguish themselves on the ground \u2015 using distinct denominational structures, for example.\n\nBut Jones said the general consensus in social science circles at the moment is against separating out black evangelicals of color, since black churches don\u2019t have a similar divide between those who consider themselves evangelical and those who don\u2019t. And for other racial and ethnic categories, the sample sizes obtained in public opinion surveys aren\u2019t big enough to break out evangelicals of color with confidence.\n\nPRRI\u2019s 2017 American Values Atlas, an annual survey of approximately 50,000 people, indicated that 63 percent of black Protestants and 70 percent of Hispanic Protestants identify as evangelical \u2015 suggesting there is significant overlap between black and Hispanic evangelicals of color and black and Hispanic Protestants of color.\n\nBrendan McDermid / Reuters A group of interfaith religious leaders protests against then-presidential candidate Donald Trump outside a hotel where he met with evangelical leaders in New York City on June 21, 2016.\n\nPRRI also found that many white evangelicals don\u2019t have positive views about America\u2019s growing racial and ethnic diversity. PRRI asked survey participants how they felt about the fact that the U.S. census projections show that by 2045, African-Americans, Latinos, Asians and mixed racial and ethnic groups will together comprise a majority of the U.S. population.\n\nAgain, white evangelicals were the only major religious group in which a majority expressed negative feelings about this demographic change, PRRI reports. Fifty-four percent of white evangelical Protestants said that America becoming a majority-nonwhite nation by 2045 will have a mostly negative effect on the country.\n\nOn the other hand, most black Protestants (80 percent) and Hispanic Protestants (79 percent) thought the country\u2019s coming racial and ethnic realignment will be mostly positive.\n\nAndrew Whitehead, a sociologist at Clemson University who studies religion, told HuffPost he thinks Christian nationalism, an ideology that fuses Christians\u2019 love of God and country, influences how white evangelicals think about race, immigration and diversity.\n\n\u201cFor white evangelicals, the idea of the United States as a Christian nation serves to solidify racial and ethnic boundaries around national identity, which then serves to bolster anti-black or anti-immigrant prejudice,\u201d Clemson said.\n\nAnadolu Agency via Getty Images Evangelical Christians gather for Sunday worship service at First Evangelical Church in Memphis, Tennessee, on Jan. 7, 2018.\n\nRespondents\u2019 racial identities also affected their opinions about how racism manifests itself in America. For example, white evangelicals and Protestants of color are deeply divided about the root causes of police violence against black Americans. The vast majority of white evangelicals (71 percent) believed that recent police shootings of African-American men are isolated incidents. Just 15 percent of black Protestants say the same \u2015 most believe that these killings of black men are part of a broader pattern of how police treat African-Americans (84 percent).\n\nToyama-Szeto told HuffPost she \u201cabsolutely\u201d believes there is a connection between the president\u2019s rhetoric and the emboldening of white supremacist groups.\n\n\u201cWe have always had racial violence\u2015and we probably will in some forms. But what has changed is the way that the rhetoric from the top has made space for people to express what was socially not acceptable,\u201d Toyama-Szeto said. \u201cAnd that rhetoric has led to action\u2015violence like we\u2019ve seen in the past weeks.\u201d\n\nIn the PRRI survey, conducted weeks before the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting, researchers found that most black Protestants (75 percent) and Hispanic Protestants (63 percent) said they believed that Trump\u2019s decisions and behavior had encouraged white supremacists.\n\nOn the other hand, white evangelicals were less likely to see a connection between Trump and white supremacists. Only 26 percent of white evangelicals said Trump\u2019s decisions and behavior have encouraged white supremacists.\n\nToyama-Szeto said she believes that these gaps in opinion between white evangelicals and Protestants of color are partly due to the fact that these groups don\u2019t often worship in the same spaces.\n\n\u201cWhen you don\u2019t have access to other people\u2019s experiences\u2015especially across ethnic, economic, and geographic boundaries\u2015it can be easy to default and care only about the issues that affect you, your family, and your friends,\u201d she wrote.\n\nKevin Lamarque/Reuters Faith leaders place their hands on the shoulders of President Donald Trump as he takes part in a prayer for those affected by Hurricane Harvey in the Oval Office on Sept. 1, 2017.\n\nGerardo Marti, a sociologist at Davidson College who studies race and religion, told HuffPost that Protestants of color have long understood that there is a cultural gap between their lives and the lives of their white co-religionists. But white Christians have a hard time believing that their own racial backgrounds deeply inform their attitudes.\n\n\u201cThey do not understand it as \u2018racism\u2019 and refuse to acknowledge it as such because they do not believe they have hateful attitudes toward black people they know,\u201d Marti said.\n\nThese divisions in opinion about immigration and racism are occurring at a time when American evangelicalism is actually becoming more diverse. As a whole, evangelical Christians are still predominantly white. But about 35 percent of evangelicals are not white, according to PRRI. They identify as black, Hispanic, Asian and Pacific Islander, Native American, or part of some other racial or ethnic group. That percentage is only likely to increase, researchers say, not just because America is becoming more diverse but also because young white evangelicals are leaving the church.\n\nIn the long run, Marti said he thinks white evangelical churches will boast about their increasing racial and ethnic diversity. At the same time, he predicts leaders will try to obscure underlying conservative social and political attitudes about abortion, immigration, homosexuality and racial justice, focusing instead on the individual and his or her personal spiritual relationship to God.\n\nBRENDAN SMIALOWSKI via Getty Images President Donald Trump and the president of Liberty University, Jerry Falwell Jr., participate in the Pledge of Allegiance during a commencement ceremony at the evangelical Christian university on May 13, 2017, in Lynchburg, Virginia.\n\nAs American Christianity gets more diverse, Marti thinks white evangelicals may increasingly perceive themselves as an oppressed minority.\n\n\u201cIt may be strange to say, but once the white demographic moves under 50%, it will further energize their belief that they need to fight to protect their way of life, one they believe is called for and sanctioned by Jesus himself,\u201d Marti wrote.\n\nToyama-Szeto believes the biggest challenge for white evangelicals in the future is whether they will be able to work with and accept the leadership of Christians of color.", "The Culinary Workers Union in Las Vegas is known as a kingmaker in Nevada politics. Their voter registration efforts ahead of Tuesday\u2019s elections help explain why.\n\nThe union has registered 10,300 new voters among its members and their families since the 2016 election, according to a spokeswoman. The Culinary, as it\u2019s known, also helped more than 650 immigrants in Nevada become citizens this year alone.\n\nThere is a lot going on in the Silver State that those new voters could influence. Republicans are in danger of losing the governor\u2019s mansion; Democrats could potentially win a supermajority in the state legislature; and Republican Sen. Dean Heller is in a neck-and-neck race with challenger Rep. Jacky Rosen, a Democrat who won the Culinary\u2019s endorsement.\n\nA majority of the union\u2019s 57,000 members are Latino, many of them immigrants who work in hotels and casinos on the Vegas Strip and downtown. In Las Vegas, unlike just about any other U.S. city, the Culinary\u2019s organizing success has made union membership the norm, rather that the exception, for bartenders, servers and housekeepers.\n\nAs HuffPost reported in June, the union has wielded its size and reach not only to win middle-class wages through collective bargaining agreements, but to influence political campaigns and push for progressive causes on behalf of its members. Voter registration has been a key component of the union\u2019s long game.\n\nThe Culinary utilizes a rare leave-of-absence program to bolster its political activism: Under their union contracts, workers can take off several months from their jobs to focus full-time on registering new voters, helping immigrants gain citizenship, organizing new workplaces or negotiating collective bargaining agreements. The union pays the worker\u2019s typical wages and benefits during the leave, and the worker is guaranteed a job to return to.\n\nThe union has also negotiated contracts allowing members to access break areas inside hotels and casinos where they can talk to other workers about political campaigns and upcoming elections, so that the union can mobilize ahead of Election Day.\n\nGeoconda Arguello-Kline, the union\u2019s top official, told HuffPost earlier this year that the leaves of absence have become a crucial tool in cultivating new leaders within the union and growing its clout in Nevada.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know any other way,\u201d said Arguello-Kline, a Nicaraguan immigrant and former Vegas housekeeper. \u201cFor us, it\u2019s a very natural way to survive here in Las Vegas: organize, organize.\u201d", "Axl Rose may have sung \u201cPatience\u201d in 1988, but when it comes to President Donald Trump in 2018, Rose\u2019s has run out.\n\nThe Guns N\u2019 Roses frontman posted a rant on Twitter on Sunday after he caught wind that Trump\u2019s campaign played one of the band\u2019s most famous songs at a rally.\n\nRose tweeted that the band \u201cformally requested\u201d that Trump no longer play its songs at his rallies because the band\u2019s members are \u201copposed to the unauthorized use of their music at political events.\u201d\n\nHe also explained why other artists, such as Rihanna and Pharrell, have been having a similar issue with the president\u2019s campaign.

To be part of a problem I was hoping I was helping makes it that much more embarrassing & hard to- \u2014 Rebel Wilson (@RebelWilson) November 5, 2018", "On a Monday night in December 2016, hundreds of false flames flickered in the hands of the mourners on the northeastern end of Oakland\u2019s Lake Merritt.\n\nThey were huddled around the lake\u2019s pergola, a curved colonnade of plaster and wood constructed in 1913 at the behest of Frank K. Mott, a five-term mayor who\u2019d built his reputation by presiding over a crisis of refugees flowing in after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. In the century since, the crescent space had become a gathering spot for drum circles, slackline practice or a sunset shared with a tall boy. But on this chilly night, it was the focal point for the town\u2019s ongoing memorial to the 36 people who\u2019d died three nights earlier in a fire at the warehouse called Ghost Ship.\n\nThe service was originally designed as a candlelit affair, but organizers thought better of the optics and requested that the congregation bring \u201cflameless candles, glow sticks, flashlights, or other types of light.\u201d Hipster parents brought their kids, who drew chalk hearts in the sidewalk and inscribed within them the names of the dead. A parade of speakers fought the constant drone of the news chopper above to tell the stories of the lost souls and what could have been. U.S. Congresswoman Barbara Lee sent condolences from President Barack Obama, who\u2019d taken time away from giving the president-elect a tutorial for his new gig.\n\nThen it was Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf\u2019s turn to speak.\n\n\u201cThis city is going to go through a lot of emotions, and one of them is going to be anger,\u201d Schaaf began, addressing the boos the crowd had greeted her with. \u201cSafety is about being safe from harm. Safety is also about having safe housing, to know that you are secure and will not be displaced.\u201d\n\nThat triggered the crowd.\n\n\u201cRight to return! Right to return!\u201d someone shouted, citing the city law that ostensibly allows displaced residents to return to equivalent apartments at the same rent, but in practice, is a rule without gums let alone teeth. After two uncomfortable minutes, Schaaf mentioned something vague about Oakland \u201cshowing up\u201d and walked back into the darkness, leaving her town to reckon with the question of who was to blame.\n\nIt\u2019s still unclear how the fire began \u2014 early reports suggested a faulty refrigerator but that was quickly ruled out; others hinted that it started in a nearby structure and spread. What\u2019s known for sure is that something somehow caught fire in Ghost Ship around 11:20 p.m. on Friday, Dec. 2, 2016, and within minutes, 36 people were dead.\n\nWhat\u2019s also apparent is that the question at the heart of the tragedy \u2014 who is to blame? \u2014 lingers unanswered in Oakland almost two years later. It is why, in part, Schaaf found herself on uneven footing as she headed into Election Day.\n\nOfficial efforts at redress have focused on individual culpability, and after a herky-jerky series of court decisions, trials loom in 2019. But as a civic matter, beyond the narrow interests of criminal and civil procedure, the tragedy is about more than the alleged deadly negligence of a handful of people. Ghost Ship, recently greenlighted for demolition, will live on as a monument to the interlocking forces that have formed \u2014 and deformed \u2014 modern Oakland. A kind of conspiracy was behind the fire. To see the full set of possible culprits, you have to get up close and then zoom out.\n\nStephen Loewinsohn for HuffPost Looking down into the remains of Ghost Ship warehouse, photographed in August 2018.\n\nThe Master Tenants\n\nWhat made the fire at Ghost Ship so deadly was that the space was hosting a concert that night. This was normal for the place \u2014 both due to the type of scene its residents wanted to cultivate and, more pragmatically, as cover charges helped pay rent \u2014 but there\u2019s no indication that the fire started because of the mass inside.\n\nThe show was a stop on the West Coast tour for the Los Angeles-based house music label 100% Silk and had been planned, or at least presided over, by Max Harris, who worked the door that night. In photos, his most striking features are large-gauge earlobe plugs and a tattoo of a crescent outside his left eye. Dubbed the \u201ccreative director\u201d of Ghost Ship, accounts have described Harris as being in charge of the day to day, filling in the logistical gaps left by the space\u2019s occasionally drug-infused head personality: Derick Ion Almena.\n\nAlmena, 48, lived there and curated the space\u2019s style. More importantly, legally speaking at least, Almena was the lease-holding master tenant. To escape that night\u2019s concert, he\u2019d taken his family to a hotel, where he found out about the blaze. \u201cEverything I worked so hard for is gone,\u201d he posted to Facebook on the Saturday morning after the fire. \u201cIt\u2019s as if I have awoken from a dream filled with opulence and hope ... to be standing now in poverty of self worth.\u201d\n\nThe post was quickly derided for its callousness \u2014 a lot of people lost much more than rental property or \u201cself worth\u201d \u2014 and was soon deleted. Almena\u2019s wife later said it was posted before he\u2019d found out about the deaths. But that didn\u2019t mean the sentiment was entirely inaccurate. By all accounts, the design and layout were completed under Almena\u2019s aesthetic direction, and it was that vision that made Ghost Ship what it was. This, ultimately, was why Almena was the one whom the \u201cToday\u201d show chose to pay for an exclusive interview.\n\nAccording to the Pulitzer Prize-winning investigation by the East Bay Times, Almena took over the lease in late 2013, and soon took it on as his primary art project. He crammed in any and all matter of antique refuse, seemingly more concerned about expressing his own artistic sense than fostering a communal style of living. As Michael Rosen, who went to the warehouse hours before the fire, described in his recollection:\n\nDownstairs, the space was packed with wooden pieces of artwork. There were wooden accents on the walls, a wooden ship\u2019s wheel. The space was subdivided into rooms with walls made of aged, dried-out wood. Chairs were scattered on the sides with Persian rugs in between them.\n\nWorries about all that wood acting as an accelerant had been expressed long before the fire. At least one previous partygoer says he offered to donate fire extinguishers, an idea that Almena allegedly responded to with disinterest. In interviews with me, people who\u2019d attended previous events there recalled never wanting to return to the unsafe space. It makes sense when you see archival photos of the claustrophobic, kindling-rich environment.\n\nIn addition to the scattered, flammable refuse, what led to the high death toll was a lack of direct access to exits. The main chokepoint that night was on the staircase leading from the ground floor entrance to the top floor loft where the performances took place. \u201cStaircase\u201d is perhaps a generous characterization. It was a narrow, rickety structure made of wooden pallets; when the fire began, a bottleneck formed and the structure collapsed, trapping those upstairs. One mystery woman reportedly sat in a wicker chair at the foot of the staircase, telling people to remain upstairs, that this fire was \u201dthe will of the spirits of the forest.\u201d\n\nOther exits had their own problems. A back staircase was either purposely blocked or simply unknown to partygoers, a distinction to be resolved in court. Anyone escaping that way would have had to navigate a chaotic maze of tiny residences separated by wooden slats, a \u201crabbit warren\u201d where \u201d15 to 25\u201d people lived at any given time. And even then, even if they\u2019d gotten through that gantlet, they would have found the near exit fully obstructed with debris. Survivors would have had to wind through the smoke-filled, pitch-black dark to a front entrance hidden by a trio of old upright pianos\n\nAll of this, intentional or not, was Almena\u2019s doing.\n\nIn June 2017, Alameda County prosecutors charged Almena and Harris with 36 counts of involuntary manslaughter. A year later, parties negotiated \u201cno contest\u201d plea deals to avoid a trial. The district attorney said it would save the families from the toll of a long trial, which was expected to take four to six months, while conspiracists saw it as bureaucrats covering their own asses; Schaaf was reportedly going to be subpoenaed to testify about the city\u2019s role. The settlement terms would have allowed Almena to leave jail after roughly three and a half years, and Harris after two.\n\nHowever, in August, after two days of emotional testimony from victims\u2019 families, an Alameda County Superior Court judge felt that Almena was \u201cnot accepting full responsibility and remorse,\u201d and, in a stunning decision, rejected the plea deal. If another deal isn\u2019t worked out \u2014 and all parties claim future deals are off the table \u2014 Almena and Harris will be tried sometime in early 2019. If found guilty, they could face 39 years in prison.\n\nStephen Loewinsohn for HuffPost The 2016 Ghost Ship fire killed 36 people.\n\nThe Landlord\n\nRent checks that Harris collected would go to Almena, who then paid the property\u2019s sole owner since 1996, Chor Ng.\n\nThe warehouse was part of a $5 million collection of property owned by Ng and her family \u2014 according to an interview after the fire, Ng\u2019s son, Kai, largely managed the building due to language barriers \u2014 and it included massage parlors, florists, bakeries, even a Buddhist temple. Tenants from the other locations have described Chor Ng as a \u201cpick up the rent once a month and leave them be\u201d type of landlord. But there\u2019s a dramatic distinction between hands-off and criminal neglect.\n\nWhile Ng is named as a defendant in the civil suit brought in 2017 by a coalition of victims\u2019 families, she\u2019s been left off the defendant roster in the criminal proceedings. Why? In filed documents, county prosecutors claimed that Almena and Harris deceived property owners to the point that it had become their sole responsibility. \u201cWitnesses state they warned Almena numerous times about the obvious fire hazard in the warehouse,\u201d the filing stated.\n\nBut that excuse has gaps. At its core, the question is one of what Ng knew, and when.\n\nWe know that Ng was alerted to an electrical fire that had occurred at Ghost Ship two years earlier; a 2014 invoice discovered by the Bay\u2019s local Fox affiliate shows that repairs totaling $23,000 were needed for a transformer that was \u201cseverely and catastrophically\u201d overloaded. That\u2019s likely because the power running into Ghost Ship came from the car stereo shop next door, also owned by Ng, via wires that ran through holes in the wall. Former Ghost Ship tenants mention frequent power outages, which required trips into the shop to reset the breaker, while others mention shoddy electrical equipment occasionally sparking. (Tellingly, a lawsuit by the victims\u2019 families against the Pacific Gas and Electric utility company has been allowed to go ahead; in court documents filed recently, the Ng family tried to deflect blame onto their electrician.)\n\nDid Ng know people were living inside and still allow for conditions without sprinklers or safety lights, and with bars on the windows? Ng\u2019s lawyer claims she had no idea, but on Jan. 20, 2014, months after signing the lease with Almena, his then-partner Nicholas Bouchard wrote Ng an email explaining why he wanted his name struck from the document.\n\n\u201cHe has altered the property without your consent,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI think you should exercise whatever remedies you have to immediately take possession of the property to prevent further damage.\u201d\n\nStephen Loewinsohn for HuffPost An electrical fire had occurred at Ghost Ship two years before the 2016 tragedy.\n\nThe Town\n\nWhen I visited the warehouse last April, two industrial dumpsters were out front, holding debris still being excavated from the gutted interior. Between them sat a makeshift memorial composed of a dead tree, its spindly branches dropping from the weight of homemade ornaments with names and photos of victims. Behind, the ornate font proclaiming \u201cGHOST SHIP\u201d and the iconic skull remained visible on the structure itself, still smoke-stained from that December night. It\u2019s not until you walk that space that you grasp how out in the open it was.\n\nGhost Ship was not hidden.\n\nAcross from the entrance is a Wendy\u2019s \u2014 you could throw a rock from the memorial tree to the drive-thru menu board \u2014 and a few doors down is a row of single-family homes. A block away is the high-traffic intersection of Fruitvale Avenue and International Boulevard, it\u2019s unmistakable from the elevated BART line nearby, and there\u2019s a fire department 511 feet away. Ghost Ship was physically embedded in the life of its neighborhood, in a way warehouses typically are not.\n\nThe dangers of Ghost Ship were long known to the city, too. Leaked body camera footage shows police responding to a 2015 call. \u201cOne spark and it will all be bad,\u201d says an officer in one of seven videos the San Jose Mercury News obtained of police examinations of the interior. Witnesses recall seeing firefighters attend a party there two years earlier. And yet, despite the warehouse being a known illegal quantity, building code enforcement inspectors had not been inside for 30 years. Clearly, messages weren\u2019t getting to wherever they needed to go; a subsequent investigation by the Mercury News showed that 80 percent of unsafe building notices by the fire department went unchecked by code inspectors.\n\nOn Nov. 17, less than a month before the fire, an inspector was sent to Ghost Ship to investigate a report of an illegal structure inside. The gate was chained, so access was impossible, but the investigator still issued a violation for the trash that had piled on the sidewalk. That notice was sent to Ng, and only Ng, despite the State of California\u2019s Health and Safety Code (HSC 17980.6), which explicitly states (italics mine): \u201cAny order [...] shall be provided either by both posting a copy of the order or notice in a conspicuous place on the property and by first-class mail to each affected residential unit, or by posting a copy of the order or notice in a conspicuous place on the property and in a prominent place on each affected residential unit.\u201d\n\nConversations with people who have lived in similar unpermitted live/work situations suggest that inspectors often send violation notices to only the off-site landlord, a tactic that keeps warnings away from those living in actual danger.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re holding Derick Almena accountable, and I think they should,\u201d says David Keenan, founder of the Oakland art collective Omni Commons, \u201cbut they\u2019re not holding themselves accountable.\u201d In the wake of the fire, Keenan helped create the volunteer-led organization Safer DIY Spaces, which liaisons among the city, landlords and tenants. It\u2019s a fraught process, he says, with many frustrations.\n\nA big reason has been the city itself. Oakland has a long history of inspector malfeasance. In 2011, a civil grand jury was so \u201cappalled\u201d by the department\u2019s \u201cpattern of arbitrary and excessive fees, fines and abusive actions by building supervisors and inspectors\u201d that it recommended revoking its authority altogether. The picture painted by the report, as well as by those who have worked with inspectors in the past, is that Ghost Ship wasn\u2019t some lone problem that slipped through the cracks but the normal state of affairs that happened to take a bad turn.\n\n\u201cThe inspectors aren\u2019t well trained, but they know enough to shut down a building,\u201d says Jonah Strauss, founder of the Oakland Warehouse Coalition, an advocacy organization born of worries about a city crackdown on live/work spaces after the fire; his own space became unlivable after a lethal fire in 2015.\n\nThe climate created by feckless-yet-hardass inspectors who tell landlords to \u201cfix it or get shut down\u201d exacerbates the strained relationship that many renters already have with their landlords. If tenants are on handshake deals instead of official leases, there\u2019s no real recourse to dangerous conditions, other than moving out and hoping to luck into the Bay Area\u2019s last affordable unit. \u201cWhat are you going to do, call code enforcement and say, \u2018I have a major issue in my home and my landlord won\u2019t fix it?\u2019\u201d Strauss says. \u201cThey\u2019ll come through and issue a notice of violation that includes discontinuance of residential use.\u201d\n\nOne example is the tale of 1919 Market St. For decades, it was an artists\u2019 live/work warehouse that was effectively, if not officially, condoned by the city. Rumor had it that former Mayor Jean Quan held a party there. But that arrangement changed in 2015, after tenants in the space complained to the city and on YouTube about the dangerous conditions. The city slapped the owner \u2014 who\u2019d been happy to collect rent from the tenants \u2014 with a bunch of violations. But rather than fixing the problems, the owner sold to developer Danny Haber, who demolished the warehouse. (He did so without permission, it later emerged; a recent lawsuit also alleges that toxic spillage from the demolition leaked into nearby houses.) Over 100 residents were displaced from the space.\n\nThe choice seems simple: Say nothing and live in danger, or complain and lose your home.\n\n\u201cOf course, the tenants don\u2019t trust the city. The landlords don\u2019t trust the city. Nobody trusts the city!\u201d Strauss says. \u201cIt\u2019s justifiable not to trust the city.\u201d\n\nStephen Loewinsohn for HuffPost The Ghost Ship warehouse was a few doors down from a row of single-family homes and across from a Wendy's, not hidden away in the city.\n\nThe System\n\n\n\nMatt Hummel has an old button that reads \u201cLet Oakland Shine.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an advertisement from 2002, put out by the Rental Housing Association of Southern Alameda County as part of a campaign to urge Oakland to vote \u201cno\u201d on Measure EE. The measure introduced a \u201cjust cause for eviction\u201d ordinance which, if passed, would shift the status quo from landlords evicting tenants for any reason at all, to only being able to evict for 11 specific ones (not paying rent, disorderly conduct, illegal activity, etc.).\n\nThe measure promised a dramatic shift in power, and it was countered with an insidious campaign. As described in a 2002 East Bay Express piece, \u201cliterature put out by Measure EE\u2019s opponents has raised the specter of junkies and sex offenders invading properties and becoming impossible to evict.\u201d The scare tactics almost worked, too \u2014 Measure EE passed by only a little over 1,000 votes. It was expected to be a huge blow to property owners\u2019 power, and to Hummel, the slogan on the button summed up a certain mindset that had recently taken root in town.\n\n\u201c\u2018If we don\u2019t kick out the people we have, Oakland will never get better,\u2019\u201d Hummel says, parroting the subtext of the campaign against Measure EE. \u201cThe citizens of Oakland are not who the owners of Oakland wanted. It\u2019s who they got.\u201d\n\nHummel has seen this ideological shift play out in real time.\n\nHe originally moved to Oakland in the early \u201990s and found himself living in the East Oakland warehouse known as The Vulcan. It was about a mile east of what would become Ghost Ship. The total cost to the tenants was $900 a month, split three or four ways depending on who was around, a price that afforded shelter without necessitating working 40 or more hours a week. This led to a thriving artist community. Free time, or \u201cboredom,\u201d will do that. Paintings graced the walls, metallurgic sculptures guarded hallways and live performances took place in the wide-open space. They even had a pirate radio station.\n\nAfter a few years, Hummel moved across town to another warehouse a few miles west. It had once housed the factory for Mother\u2019s Cookies, a local independent success story until Kellogg\u2019s bought it out in 2008. The rent at Mother\u2019s was $300 a month, which included utilities and a pantry stocked with food. If someone wanted to share a room with their partner, he or she had to pay an extra $100. This was life in Oakland\u2019s \u201cvacant\u201d warehouses.\n\nUnlike the 47-square-mile city across the Bay \u2014 which fought to stay flat as long as it could, before caving to vertical rise in the late \u201960s \u2014 a significant part of Oakland has consistently been filled by short, squat warehouse buildings. As the western terminus for the Transcontinental Railroad and home to the Port of Oakland, the city saw warehouses begin popping up in the late 19th century for storage and to house manufacturing concerns. The warehouse that became Ghost Ship was built in 1930 and, according to The New York Times, \u201csat amid factories, mills and beer gardens established by the neighborhood\u2019s many immigrants.\u201d\n\nBut in the early 20th century, as University of California, Berkeley, economic geographer Richard Walker described in his 1997 history \u201cOakland: Dark Star in an Expanding Universe,\u201d \u201cdeindustrialization before deindustrialization\u201d took hold. The Great Depression gave Oakland \u201cits fair share of Hoovervilles and hobo camps,\u201d and post-World War II disinvestment led to a \u201csudden and decisive shrinkage of Oakland\u2019s manufacturing base.\u201d Robert Self writes in American Babylon: Race and the Struggle for Postwar Oakland:\n\nBetween the 1950s and 1960s, operating expenses increased and older facilities in Oakland declined in profitability. Despite the precipitous drop in property values in Oakland, industrial land there was still far more expensive than in suburban cities, which encouraged plant relocation.\n\nDeindustrialization continued throughout Ronald Reagan\u2019s reign as head of California, then the country. Left behind were vacant warehouses to be filled by those who traded safety and legality for affordability. Poor minorities had no other options, while artist enclaves made deals with landlords. For the latter, it was a win-win \u2014 landlords collected income on something that was just sitting there, and people got to live how they wanted on the cheap.\n\nBut deindustrialization also left holes in Oakland\u2019s downtown. In 1999, then-Mayor Jerry Brown unveiled his \u201c10K Plan,\u201d an urban planning effort to bring 10,000 residents into the downtown core within 10 years. Brown offered himself up as an example, purchasing and refurbishing an industrial warehouse near downtown as his residence. Other autonomous efforts, like the street art collective known as Oaklandish \u2014 before it swerved into its current business as an Oakland pride apparel brand \u2014 took up the mantle as well, invading the desolate core with viral marketing celebrating the city\u2019s history.\n\nWhile Brown\u2019s campaign wasn\u2019t a complete success, it worked well enough. Word trickled out about Oakland\u2019s great secret: It actually wasn\u2019t that scary. Money from the first dot-com bubble that didn\u2019t lodge in the exorbitantly priced San Francisco wormed across the Bay. The price on housing rose, and as it did, landlords culled their low-paying tenants and replaced them with those making tech money; Measure EE was an attempted defense against this round of evictions.\n\nEventually, for Hummel and his roommates, life at Mother\u2019s took on a different form. As prices around them rose, landlord resentment grew. \u201cOur landlord became pissed because we had so much space for the price we were paying,\u201d Hummel says, whose collective at Mother\u2019s paid a total of $2,000 a month for 7,000 square feet. \u201cThey took it personally. They felt that we were literally stealing from them every month that we paid them rent.\u201d\n\nAfter years of fighting, Hummel \u201cgave in\u201d to a small settlement and moved to a place in the hills. In 2017, Mother\u2019s Cookies changed hands again for a record $9.86 millon. Its \u201chistory\u201d section doesn\u2019t mention anything that occurred in the building after 1949.\n\nAs the breakup of warehouse collectives continued, so did the more general displacement of low-income renters throughout Oakland, either through force of eviction \u2014 even with \u201cjust cause,\u201d the entirety of law is firmly on the side of property owners \u2014 or by tenants moving on their own, no longer wanting to live under the cloud of murky rights. Whenever one left, a wealthier tenant took his or her place, and the city soon became entrenched in a fight between tenant classes: Real Oakland vs. the Tech Gentrifiers.\n\n\u201cThe dot-com-ers were getting angry because they couldn\u2019t get to sleep, and it became neighbors fighting neighbors,\u201d Hummel says. \u201cLandlords definitely preferred the new tenants to the old ones.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s how a 2006 East Bay Express piece, titled \u201cHipster Invasion,\u201d put it:\n\nThis is success, right? Well that depends upon whom you ask. The downtown art scene\u2019s rapid growth already has led to bitchy infighting among its founders, and cries of \u201cwhite invasion\u201d and \u201cgentrification\u201d from the black residents who have lived in this hood for decades.\n\nThen came the U.S. housing crash.\n\nErin McElroy examines the history of Bay Area evictions for the Anti-Eviction Mapping Project and says the current housing crisis can be directly linked to the foreclosure crisis of 2008-2009, especially in the East Bay. \u201cThe damage was more severe in Oakland than in San Francisco,\u201d says McElroy. \u201cThere was a massive loss of residents in single-family homes, and of tenants of color.\u201d According to the AEMP, between 2010 and 2014, the city lost 4 percent of its black population. That trend has only continued in the years since.\n\nFrom a disaster-capitalist perspective, it makes sense that investor focus would be on Oakland. As a system, development tries to find the biggest difference between cost paid and price sold. San Francisco\u2019s leftover capital from the first dot-com boom kept it relatively stable during the crisis, but in Oakland, where predatory lenders had targeted minority neighborhoods to exploit their dreams of cheap stability, post-crash foreclosures skyrocketed. As a report on Oakland\u2019s foreclosures before and after the housing market collapse details:\n\nBetween 2007 and 2011, 1 in 7 Oakland mortgages entered default, with 1 in 14 eventually lost to foreclosure. [...] The vast majority of foreclosed properties were located in the East and West Oakland \u201cflatlands,\u201d diverse areas shaped in part by a legacy of racial and economic segregation.\n\nAs was the case in many parts of the country, investor groups were ready with bundles of cash to snatch up properties at the dirt-cheap prices. Longtime landlords took buyouts, and the new property owners began trying to recoup on their investments. Step one was getting rid of any tenants paying \u201cbelow-market value,\u201d an ever-shifting standard that their own purchases had jacked up. And once they got rid of those tenants, thanks to provisions in the state\u2019s Costa\u2013Hawkins Act of 1995 \u2014 which could be undone this year with a \u201cyes\u201d vote on California Proposition 10 \u2014 they could reset the rent to whatever they saw fit.\n\nNobody can afford housing, especially folks of color. No one is making enough money to pay rent, so you have people living in sketchy-ass situations because landlords are fucking sharks. Living here is living in an environment of such scarcity all the fucking time. Sharmi Basu, an Oakland-based electronic artist\n\nOakland entered the age of serial evictors. William Rosetti, who sat on Libby Schaaf\u2019s Housing Implementation Cabinet, has issued over 4,000 eviction notices since 2008. The aforementioned Danny Haber, accused of hiding properties through shell companies and LLCs, has been criticized for transforming distressed buildings that once housed low-income tenants into condos and apartments for the rich. \u201cBuilding housing feels like the ultimate entrepreneurial thing to do,\u201d Haber told San Francisco magazine in 2018.\n\nFor better, and many times for worse, that entrepreneurial spirit spread to independent landlords. They\u2019d scour old leases for ways to get past \u201cjust cause,\u201d or simply made conditions miserable enough that tenants moved out on their own. Either was considered a success. \u201cAny landlord who has any chance of pushing out tenants and is in it for the money is absolutely going to do that,\u201d Strauss says. \u201cLaws are irrelevant. Capital is a very real draw, and it has turned good people into bad, and made bad people worse.\u201d\n\nWhen Cody Blanchard moved to Oakland in 2005, it seemed like the Wild West. \u201cPeople were living in all kinds of crazy places,\u201d he says. \u201cJust doing what they wanted, and building these weird living spaces.\u201d He began playing in bands, but unlike San Francisco \u2014 where the music scene mostly took place in \u201cproper\u201d venues \u2014 the East Bay was a motley collection of warehouses and backyards. Blanchard is one of the founders of the indie rock band Shannon and the Clams \u2014 whose latest album, \u201cOnion,\u201d has a number of songs about the Ghost Ship fire and its fallout. He estimates he\u2019s played over 40 different such places over the years. He lists a few: First Church of the Buzzard. LoBot Gallery. Ghost Town.\n\nOver the years, he\u2019s noticed the number of spots shrinking. Landlords sold outright, \u201cmoved back in\u201d under the provisions of the state\u2019s Ellis Act or \u201crenovated\u201d so they could jack up the rent. With no affordable options, \u201ca lot of people just moved somewhere,\u201d he says, \u201cLA, the Pacific Northwest, Sacramento.\u201d Blanchard\u2019s own situation became tenuous, and he soon followed the exodus.\n\nBlanchard flew back to Oakland the day after the fire. \u201cI think I saw everyone that I met in the week I was back,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was really intense.\u201d In between memorials, he heard stories about friends\u2019 living situations; in the Bay, every conversation turns to that topic if you give it enough time. He found out that some friends were in a building owned by an octogenarian landlord who\u2019s not in peak physical condition. They\u2019re worried about what will happen to them when she dies.\n\n\u201cHer son will get the property, but he doesn\u2019t care to be a landlord, so he\u2019ll probably sell,\u201d he says. No one knows what will happen after that, but to the tenants, it feels as if her death will bring about their own displacement.\n\nIt\u2019s important to consider the artist warehouse scene\u2019s place in the broader environment of low-income housing. While warehouse artists do face specific pressures \u2014 California\u2019s newly legalized cannabis industry, in its search for open indoor space, has brought another round of warehouses evictions; to defend it, in March, the city passed a law prohibiting cannabis companies from operating in spaces currently occupied by live-work residents \u2014 focusing solely on them misses their effect on the rest of a city\u2019s low-income population. This is due to the odd market quirk wherein artists, vulnerable to the very economic forces that created the conditions for their fragile bohemia to thrive in the first place, are in many ways instruments of their own demise.\n\nAs a 2017 paper by Scranton professor Meghan Ashlin Rich summarized, artists have long been used as tools for gentrification:\n\n[T]he influx of arts-themed development helps raise property values and spurs re-colonization of the neighborhood\u2019s large industrial buildings, making it difficult for artists to find legal, affordable live/work spaces in the district.\n\nThe narrative is the same from Williamsburg, Brooklyn, to Highland Park, Los Angeles. Artists move into the cheap (and technically illegal) places, use the blessings of low rent and free time to create art, boost the property value and get booted when they can\u2019t afford living there anymore. But this high value also infects the properties around it, and soon enough low-income tenants \u2014 largely working-class people of color \u2014 are pushed out, too. Yet, even while they\u2019re participating in the same fight against gentrification and property valuation, the artist class \u2014 mostly white, generally young \u2014 have privileges that set them apart. For instance, to Jaime Omar Yassin, a local activist and writer, it\u2019s telling that the Ghost Ship master tenants even had the $9,000 needed for a security deposit back in 2013.\n\n\u201cAlready it\u2019s off-limits to many who\u2019d want to live like that,\u201d Yassin says.\n\nYassin spent years revitalizing the abandoned Miller Avenue Library \u2014 a historic Spanish Colonial style library from 1914, originally built with Carnegie money \u2014 less than a mile from Ghost Ship. With neighborhood assistance, his group turned the neglected space into a free lending library and community garden. The Oakland Police Department ultimately evicted them from the building, but they continued using the space outside. \u201cWe made it so that anyone who walked in wouldn\u2019t step on a board with a nail, wouldn\u2019t be able to start a fire, wouldn\u2019t trip over a bunch of stuff, wouldn\u2019t fall into a hole,\u201d he says. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want anyone to get hurt.\u201d\n\nEventually, when Yassin and company couldn\u2019t keep the space safe anymore, they shut it down. The building burned down in February.\n\nThe day after the Ghost Ship fire, Yassin went to see the media spectacle himself. As he wrote, while dozens of reporters trained their cameras solely on the warehouse, \u201cthousands of Latino Catholics began their scheduled annual procession for the Virgen de Guadalupe\u201d from a nearby church. But rather than any of the journalists slightly angling their camera to capture the event, they \u201cshrugged\u201d at the sight. \u201cThey ignored it, and it\u2019s telling that they ignored it,\u201d says Yassin. \u201cIn their frame of mind, those people were not part of the story.\u201d\n\nYassin mentions Hasta Muerte, the nearby coffee shop recently in the news for its refusal to serve police. Previously, the building was occupied by Lucky Strike Electronics, a predominantly-POC establishment that got busted for running an illegal casino. \u201cMaybe some people were drinking and smoking in there,\u201d he says, \u201cbut that\u2019s what they were doing in Ghost Ship.\u201d Rather than continually ignoring violations, as happened with Ghost Ship, the city quickly shut down Lucky Strike. \u201cWhen the city wants to take a building they consider dangerous, they seem to knock it out in a year,\u201d Yassin says.\n\nSharmi Basu, an Oakland-based electronic artist who performs as \u201cBeast Nest,\u201d was asked to play a show at Ghost Ship nearly a year before the fire. It was billed to her as a super-secret \u201ccool new spot\u201d with enough space for a big crowd. Most importantly, it was a space, an increasing rarity in town. \u201cSo many got shut down that year,\u201d Basu says.\n\nBut while setting up for the gig, Basu got a weird vibe. The stairs were hidden and too narrow for two people to use at once. When they needed power for instruments, rather than plug into an outlet, people drilled holes in the floor and walls and ran cables through them. The situation was sketchy, but more than that, to Basu, its whole aura was bad.\n\n\u201cEverywhere I looked, there was Asian and South Asian memorabilia and expensive antiques,\u201d Basu says. \u201cThe space felt so karmically bad. It felt like the people here had the colonizer\u2019s mindset.\u201d\n\nFollowing the fire, Basu co-founded a relief fund for the families and loved ones of the victims, as well as tenants displaced by the destruction of their housing. To Basu, it was important that these efforts come from within the community itself \u2014 from people who knew, loved and dated the victims \u2014 as opposed to outsiders. \u201cThere was a group [using the Ghost Ship fire] to get the city to understand why they needed more funding for artists,\u201d Basu says. \u201cBut I was like, who are you talking about? You\u2019re talking about white artists.\u201d\n\nBasu mentions the fire at the Oakland halfway house on San Pablo Avenue on March 27, 2017, a few months after Ghost Ship. Four people died there, and over 80 people lost their homes. At least one person was pushed back into living on the streets, where he was shot and killed within a year. Compared with Ghost Ship, it barely made a blip in the news. \u201cPeople don\u2019t care when poor black people die because they can\u2019t see the economic benefit of that person existing to begin with,\u201d she says.\n\nWhen I ask Basu whom she blames for the fire, she mentions the previously detailed culprits. The tenants in charge, the landlord, the general system of oppression. Then she comes back to one particular moment that still infuriates her. It was a few nights after the fire, in a moment shared with thousands of others huddled around Lake Merritt\u2019s pergola, when the town\u2019s mayor spoke to the grieving crowd.\n\nLibby Schaaf \u201csupports so much police violence in the city, prioritizes the influx of techies moving into the city, and holds the hands of all the landlords who are constantly turning over buildings and evicting people without reason,\u201d she says. \u201cNobody can afford housing, especially folks of color. No one is making enough money to pay rent, so you have people living in sketchy-ass situations because landlords are fucking sharks.\u201d\n\nShe pauses.\n\n\u201cLiving here is living in an environment of such scarcity all the fucking time.\u201d\n\nStephen Loewinsohn for HuffPost Edwin Bernbaum, who son died in the Ghost Ship fire, helped start Vital Arts, a nonprofit to help provide safe and affordable housing and performance spaces for artists.\n\nBeyond\n\nEdwin Bernbaum was convinced he was going to die. An avid climber, he\u2019d taken time off Peace Corps work in Nepal to scale the Himalayan massif of Annapurna. In the middle of his trek, he got caught in an avalanche.\n\n\u201cI came to the edge of death, but rather than being a negative experience, there were a number of positive realizations and insights that came from it,\u201d he tells me about the experience, many decades later. \u201cBut where I came right up to death, my son came up to it, and passed through.\u201d\n\nBernbaum\u2019s son, Jonathan, was 34 years old when he died in the Ghost Ship fire.\n\nWanting something positive to come from the loss, Bernbaum connected with his old friends, Thomas Dolan and Beth Jay, and together they organized Vital Arts, a nonprofit he hopes will help solve one of the root causes of his son\u2019s death. \u201cWe have to make sure places are safe,\u201d he says. \u201cGhost Ship was one of the last ones, and a lot of people knew it was a dangerous place, and said they wouldn\u2019t go back.\u201d He pauses. \u201cBut unfortunately, Jonathan went back.\u201d\n\n\n\nBernbaum hopes to sell businesses and cities \u2014 Oakland, but also San Francisco, Berkeley and the other municipalities that make up the greater Bay Area \u2014 on the financial prospects of such an undertaking. He mentions the synergy between tech and the arts, how one of the reasons Apple succeeded was because of its unique aesthetic sense, and how it\u2019s in everyone\u2019s best interests to keep the region affordable, as that\u2019s what makes it hip and exciting, and thus a lure to the world\u2019s best and brightest workers.\n\nI ask Bernbaum whom he blames for his son\u2019s death.\n\nHe mentions Derick Almena\u2019s troubling history and the rumors he\u2019d heard about Max Harris blocking the stairwell. He calls Chor Ng\u2019s claims of not knowing that people were living there \u201ca bit of a dodge\u201d and isn\u2019t quite clear why the city isn\u2019t going after her, too. He\u2019d heard about the firefighters who partied there, the police who examined the building and the inspectors who never got the message, or just didn\u2019t care. Then he pauses and wipes away a tear.\n\n\u201cBut there\u2019s nothing we can do to bring Jonathan back,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d rather not dwell on it.\u201d\n\nAnd then he opens his laptop and, beaming with pride, shows me the art to which his son devoted his life.\n\nCORRECTION: This story has been updated to clear up some imprecise Oakland geography.

The 30-second spot, which featured the image of an unauthorized immigrant cop killer, urged viewers to vote Republican to stop an \u201cinvasion\u201d of impoverished Central American migrants walking through Mexico toward the U.S.\n\nIt was the closing pitch for an administration that spent the week before the midterm elections fabricating an immigration crisis, then blaming Democrats for it.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS President Donald Trump described a caravan of Central American migrants as an \"invasion\" during a press conference at the White House on Nov. 1.\n\nAlmost every day last week, the White House thrust immigration to the center of national politics. The Pentagon announced plans to dispatch some 5,200 troops to the border with Mexico. Trump said he planned to eliminate the constitutional guarantee of birthright citizenship by executive fiat. He announced a coming plan to bar migrants who cross illegally from claiming asylum and to detain them indefinitely in tent cities. To hear him speak at a press conference on Thursday, it would appear the United States faces an onslaught of illegal immigration.\n\nNone of this reflects reality. For the last eight years, arrests for illegal border crossing have been at their lowest levels since the 1970s.\n\nBut it does jibe with the strategy of a president who propelled himself to the White House by making specious immigration claims. Facing an election cycle that imperils the Republican majority in the House of Representatives, the president\u2019s message is clear: Voters should blame Democrats for a nonexistent catastrophe at the border.\n\nThe ad \u2014 which NBC abandoned, along with Fox and Facebook, after a major backlash \u2014 is part of Trump\u2019s strategy to drum up fears of the caravan among his base. CNN declined to air it, calling it \u201cracist.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also flatly false.\n\nLuis Bracamontes, the unauthorized immigrant in Trump\u2019s ad, was convicted in 2014 for killing two Sacramento police officers and has nothing to do with the caravan.\n\nThe original version of the ad that Trump posted to Twitter was even more blatantly dishonest. After showing clips of a deranged Bracamontes ranting in court about how he would escape and kill others, it claimed that Democrats let him into the country and that they let him stay. It then it cuts to video of the caravan, giving the impression that it\u2019s composed of similar fiends.\n\nIn fact, no one let Bracamontes in. He was deported twice, once in 1997 and again in 2001.\n\nSome critics of the ad have noted that the last time he entered the country illegally appears to have been during the presidency of George W. Bush. He didn\u2019t let Bracamontes in either, though. The fact is that Bracamontes evaded law enforcement, which is not in itself noteworthy. The rate of success for people who attempt to enter the country illegally multiple times never dipped below 96 percent until 2008, according to the Mexico Migration Project, the most comprehensive sociological database to track migration across the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nImplying that the migrant caravan is consists of dangerous criminals like Bracamontes is just as untenable as the claim that Democrats let him in. Among the several thousand people traveling through Mexico in the main caravan are 2,300 kids, according to UNICEF USA. The migrants are banding together in caravans not as some kind of invading force but as a way to seek protection in numbers from human traffickers.\n\nThe major challenge that the U.S. faces at the border is how to process efficiently an uptick in the number of Central American families and children who make asylum claims or ask for other forms of humanitarian relief from deportation. But that trend dates from 2014, so it\u2019s hardly new.\n\nIt won\u2019t be clear until after the midterm elections whether Trump will follow through on his barrage of immigration promises. But with less than 24 hours to Election Day, the more immediate question is how voters will react to his statements.", "Owen Sweeney/Invision/AP Mac Miller died in early September at his home in Los Angeles.\n\nRapper Mac Miller died in early September from \u201cmixed drug toxicity\u201d \u2015 an accidental overdose of various drugs, the Los Angeles County Department of Medical Examiner-Coroner has ruled.\n\nMiller was found unresponsive at his San Fernando Valley home on Sept. 7, and in a toxicology report released Monday the coroner\u2019s office said he had ingested fentanyl, cocaine and alcohol.\n\nThe rapper, whose real name was Malcolm James Myers McCormick, was discovered unconscious in a \u201cpraying position\u201d on his bed by a personal assistant, TMZ reported.\n\nThe assistant performed CPR on him and alerted authorities, who arrived at Miller\u2019s home shortly thereafter.

There was no question about the motive. Suspect Robert Bowers, 46, is an avowed anti-Semite who associated with like-minded racists on Gab, the social media platform for neo-Nazis and the like.\n\nHis anger was fueled by the idea that Jews were bringing immigrants into the United States to displace white people \u2015 another conspiracy theory fed by the president.\n\nThe synagogue shooting was so shocking and so transparently fueled by hate that it led to some real-world consequences for racists and their platforms. Gab went dark for a few days after host GoDaddy dropped it (it\u2019s back up this Monday, and its users are back to celebrating Bowers and the killing of Jews). Rep.

Her Instagram stories let normal humans tag along while she sweats profusely in daily workouts, wanders around the streets of New York City and Los Angeles between work meetings, and gushes about her best friendship with Michelle Williams. The stories nearly always start with a close-up on her face and a familiar preface: \u201cYou guys \u2026 \u201d\n\nE! Entertainment via Getty Images Busy Philipps and Mindy Kaling on the premiere episode of \"Busy Tonight.\"\n\nThe show leans largely on this persona and the community Philipps has cultivated, with mixed results. The show\u2019s potential is apparent, but it has has yet to define a point of view. As The Ringer\u2019s Rob Harvilla described, \u201cBusy Tonight\u201d is a \u201cvery, very, very loose hang.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s still time to grow. It was her unrepentant Busy-ness \u2015 and, let\u2019s be honest, massive organic reach \u2015 that led Philipps to a New York Times best-selling book of essays, This Will Only Hurt A Little, and eventually, a late-night show. And it was Yang, along with fellow comedy writers Kelly Oxford and Shantira Jackson, that Phillips and her team brought on to write for it. The three women have formed a little coven; they sit in the front row when Philipps tapes, functioning as commentators during each episode. When they\u2019re not on camera, they post selfies that give a glimpse into a new kind of writers room.\n\nI wanted to know more about what happens between the selfies backstage. So I called Yang to discuss her journey to \u201cBusy Tonight\u201d writerdom, why she cried in her interview, and how she, Oxford and Jackson bonded so quickly.\n\nI\u2019ve seen the first four episodes of \u201cBusy Tonight,\u201d and I\u2019m intrigued about the behind-the-scenes atmosphere. First of all, how did you get such a sweet gig? What was the process like of getting into the writers\u2019 room?\n\nOh, my God. I don\u2019t know if I can express how much this is a dream job for me. This is my first full-time TV comedy writing job, so that\u2019s No. 1. For me, everything that I\u2019ve been wanting to do, as far as the next step in my career, came together through this opportunity. I have been self-employed as a stand-up comedian and a producer of comedy shows and a maker of digital content for maybe five or six years now \u2015 which already I know as a comedian, to make a living from it period [is lucky]. About two years ago, I said to myself, \u201cTraveling can get tiring, and I want to have more time to write, whether that\u2019s for my comedy or scripts or whatever.\u201d I just love writing. That\u2019s a core part of who I am, as well as performing. [And \u201cBusy Tonight\u201d] was just this amazing opportunity that came up, that like, oh, there\u2019s this late-night talk show that is helmed by a woman, which is completely rare still, and I have a chance to be a writer/performer on it. I\u2019m like, what?\n\nOh, there\u2019s this late-night talk show that is helmed by a woman, which is completely rare still, and I have a chance to be a writer/performer on it. I\u2019m like, what? Jenny Yang\n\nCaissie [St. Onge], the showrunner, was familiar with my work because I\u2019m very online. I was in Hong Kong doing work and totally jet-lagged, and I get this little pop-up of a Facebook message from Caissie saying, \u201cHey, Jenny. I\u2019m on this new show and we\u2019re looking for writers. It\u2019s a pop culture kind of thing, with Busy Philipps. Would you be interested in submitting?\u201d I was so grateful that she thought of me, because Caissie is legendary. In my head, I was like, \u201cI am so jet-lagged and tired from being in Hong Kong. But because Caissie says that she would like to have me submit, I\u2019m going to do it.\u201d\n\nThere wasn\u2019t information about the show, but I trusted Caissie. I knew of Busy Philipps, obviously, because she\u2019s been acting for so long and she has such a social media presence and I knew she was super fun and down to earth and cool, just from her online persona. I was like, \u201cOh my gosh. Why the heck not?\u201d I wrote up my submission packet and I submitted it. You kind of have to forget about it, but then not too long later, I got a email saying, \u201cHey, we would love to meet you. Busy and a couple of us would love to meet you,\u201d and that\u2019s what happened.\n\nDuring the first episode of the show, Busy said that you cried during your interview. I really need to hear more about this.\n\n[Laughs] So one of the things that makes this opportunity so amazing for me is that I do talk a lot about politics in my public persona. It\u2019s something I really care about. One of the things that I talked about in the interview with Busy and Caissie and another one of the executive producers, all three women, was that as much as I care so deeply about politics \u2015 that was my first career \u2015 there was something about my joy being so zapped by the intensity of the politics last year, that I just needed to sort of go into self-preservation mode.\n\nOne of the outcomes of that was the beginning of 2018, I said to myself, \u201cThe politics has taken too much of my joy. I\u2019m not going to relinquish my joy anymore. Beginning 2018, I\u2019m going to live my best life. I\u2019m going to live as Opulent Jenny.\u201d I started hashtagging #OpulentJenny. My idea of opulence may not be like Busy Philipps-level opulent. I grew up very middle class. My mom was a garment worker working under-the-table wages, sewing clothing. For most of 2017, I was like, you know what? I\u2019m going to resist [fast fashion]. And then 2018, I was like, \u201cFuck it. Opulent Jenny. I don\u2019t care.\u201d\n\nEnd of December [2017], I walked by a Zara and I saw that there was this hooded, black faux fur coat on sale for $65. I was like, \u201cFuck it.\u201d It feels like you\u2019re just hugging a teddy bear all day. I literally declared for myself, \u201cI\u2019m going to wear this jacket every day in 2018.\u201d Obviously, I didn\u2019t. But for the first two months, I wore that jacket every day, even onstage, and I would talk about it and be like, \u201cThis is Opulent Jenny. I\u2019m going to take my joy back, because this feels so good,\u201d even when it was unseasonably warm in LA in February. I\u2019m like, \u201cFuck it. I\u2019m going to wear this with a tank top and cutoff shorts. I don\u2019t care.\u201d Turn up the AC.\n\nAnyway. I went on this huge digression, but I talked about this [story] in the interview, and I feel like Busy really related to that. We were just talking about how stressful the current events can be. The news can be so stressful and negative and depressing. In a moment where Julie [Darmody], who\u2019s one of the executive producers, was talking about how this is a show that\u2019s really about how we make people feel better, even if the world might feel like it\u2019s on fire, I just started to tear up.\n\nThis is all very relatable.\n\nIt\u2019s mostly because of the compassion that Julie was expressing in the meeting [that I started to tear up]. It just felt like such a comfortable conversation with these three women for a job interview, which is not very normal. Usually, going to a job interview is some weird, passive-aggressive confrontational mess. But in this context, we were having this really real conversation about how we felt about being women and doing the kind of work that we want to do, and what kind of talk show Busy wanted. When I started tearing up, I was like, oh, my God. For a hot second, I thought to myself, \u201cOh, my God. I\u2019m crying.\u201d And then, the next minute, I was like, \u201cI have to acknowledge it in front of them before they say something,\u201d so I was like, \u201cWow, that was so touching. I\u2019m crying now.\u201d Cry at a job interview, check.\n\nThey laughed. While I was still tearing up, I made eye contact with Caissie and then Caissie starts tearing up, and then I think maybe Busy started to, and we started just laughing so hard. There was a moment while I was still wiping my tears, and everyone\u2019s laughing about this, but Busy was like, \u201cOh, my God, I love you.\u201d When I heard that come out of Busy\u2019s mouth, I was like, \u201cOh, my God, she loves me. Oh, my God, she loves me. Oh, my God she loves me.\u201d In that moment, I was like, well I guess [the tearing up] was OK, because I knew Busy was chill with crying in general. But I wasn\u2019t strategically trying to cry to stay on brand. It just happened.\n\nI love this, because I\u2019m a big proponent of crying at work. I\u2019ve cried in front of every boss I\u2019ve ever had. I just appreciate that being affirmed.\n\nYou can feel things and emotions happen, it\u2019s not something to be ashamed of. It\u2019s just being a person.\n\nTell me a bit about the dynamic in the writers\u2019 room between you and Shantira Jackson and Kelly Oxford? I\u2019ve seen a lot of cute Instagram posts.\n\nWe have this really intimate, all women-identified writers\u2019 room. Kelly is amazing because she\u2019s a good friend of Busy\u2019s and so she\u2019s a source for always being tapped into who Busy is. Obviously, Kelly is this incredibly stunning, accomplished writer and in the entertainment industry already. She is just such a good source for knowing what\u2019s up in Hollywood.\n\nI don\u2019t think that the \u201cBusy Tonight\u201d audience has seen the whole power of Shantira Jackson yet, because Shantira is an incredibly accomplished improviser, trained at Second City in Chicago. She is so quick. Her energy is electric. Whenever she gets onto an idea or she\u2019s pitching, you have to just hold on for dear life because she will take it so far in such a short amount of time with her comedy.\n\nI think between the three of us, what\u2019s been really nice is that I\u2019m pretty sure this is our first time in an all-women writers\u2019 room. Immediately, it was just like, \u201cOK, we\u2019re here. Let\u2019s get to know each other.\u201d It was pretty fast for us to just get very real and talk about what it means for us to do this work as women, and the vibe of the show, which is to be really affirming and to talk about things in a late-night show context that probably most people haven\u2019t seen before.\n\nSo what\u2019s different about being in an all women-identified writers\u2019 room versus other less women-centric work spaces you\u2019ve been in?\n\nI\u2019m a stand-up comedian, and so for any stand-up comedian to develop and grow, especially even just starting in an open mic kind of circuit, you really have to be comfortable in a very male-dominated culture. It\u2019s very much like childhood playground politics. For me, a lot of my growth in my work had to be learning what it meant to play in the game of stand-up comedy, with a lot of rude-ass dudes who only make certain jokes, a lot of times at the expense of women and people of color and queer people and homeless people and disabled people \u2015 any group that is typically more vulnerable.\n\nA lot of my growth in my work had to be learning what it meant to play in the game of stand-up comedy, with a lot of rude-ass dudes. Jenny Yang\n\nAs someone who cares about human rights and about just basic rights in general, I was very aware that I needed to figure out my way in that kind of an environment. You protect yourself emotionally and also psychologically, and in how you move in terms of networking and getting to know colleagues. Luckily, for me, I built a community of really amazing women, and women of color and queer and differently-abled comedians. That\u2019s been the sort of professional foundation that I\u2019ve been able to develop here in Los Angeles, which is such a blessing.\n\nIn the professional setting, when it comes to pitching jokes or pitching ideas, it\u2019s so refreshing to be able to talk about issues that if you\u2019re a woman, you have to deal with. A lot of our producers are also women. Sometimes, when I\u2019ve taken a sketch-writing class, it was mostly dudes. When I would pitch something, if people don\u2019t understand, they can\u2019t play with you. But now, in this context, when you have an idea, everyone can add to that idea.\n\nI have to ask about the phone on set that only Oprah has the number to. Is that real?\n\nThat\u2019s very real.\n\nHow likely do you think it is that Oprah\u2019s going to call one day?\n\nWe don\u2019t know. Oprah has our number. Also, our goal as staff is to be invited to Oprah\u2019s Harvest Day, because her tomatoes be popping and we want to see them.\n\nThat\u2019s a lofty goal and I respect it.\n\nOprah\u2019s one of my personal heroes. [Pauses] It\u2019s weird. Shantira and I, as the two women of color on the writing staff, from the beginning we\u2019ve joked that we really love Busy because, deep down inside, we\u2019re white women and we want to be like a fancy white woman like Busy.\n\nIt\u2019s really fun to write for Busy because she does lean into her feminine side. She leans into her emotional and sometimes sassy attitude side. I think all of that comes together so beautifully. For me to write in that voice that\u2019s very casual and there\u2019s digressions, because the language we use is sometimes different when we\u2019re talking to our girlfriends \u2015 that to me is just so nice, because that\u2019s a huge part of me.\n\nWhen you\u2019re doing that writing, who are you hoping to reach?\n\nI really hope that anyone who wants to feel something real and energetic, but also soothing will enjoy our show. With late-night shows, we\u2019re used to seeing buttoned-up white guys in suits. What\u2019s really lovely about \u201cBusy Tonight\u201d is that Busy undoes a lot of typical late-night talk show host tropes and conventions, to say that hey, we can have a set that looks like a home. The home is not just a woman\u2019s [private] sphere. It can be a public sphere. It can be a place where we have late-night talk show content, where we\u2019re having drinks while we\u2019re talking about our vaginas or sex or period sex, or commenting about the dramas of celebrities and pop culture of the day. And that that is legitimate late-night talk show content, something that people can enjoy to wind down, not get agitated again before they go to bed.\n\nLike, the world is burning, so at the very least, we deserve a space to talk about period underwear.", "Sometime in the coming weeks, an asylum-seeking migrant caravan will be met by thousands of U.S. troops at the southwestern border. The administration has kept the cost of the deployment under wraps (reports say it could exceed $200 million), although a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff called the operation \u201cwasteful.\u201d\n\nWorse, President Donald Trump\u2019s head nod to troops to use deadly force against any rock-throwing migrants stokes tension at the border, where agents have already killed at least 97 people \u2014 citizens and noncitizens alike \u2014 over the last 15 years under opaque use-of-force policies. Now the military presence will only complicate an already fraught situation at the border, and the president\u2019s comments add to a culture of government secrecy and misinformation, fueling fear and abuse at taxpayers\u2019 expense.\n\nBorder observers for years have found that a lack of accountability and oversight has enabled agents to abuse power and kill unarmed civilians in episodes that remain shrouded in secrecy. Barack Obama\u2019s administration took nominal steps to increase transparency on border policies, but little was done to counter the culture of impunity that remains. Families of those killed are still burdened with seeking truth and justice, while perpetrators are rarely held accountable for unlawful killings.\n\nThe second federal trial of a border patrol officer who killed 16-year-old Jos\u00e9 Antonio Elena Rodr\u00edguez after shooting into Mexico through the border in 2012 is still underway. The government has stonewalled information requests for records on that case, and eyewitness accounts dispute border agents\u2019 claims that Elena Rodr\u00edguez was throwing rocks.\n\nJohn Moore via Getty Images Customs and Border Protection agents fire M4 rifles during a qualification test at a shooting range on Feb. 22 in Hidalgo, Texas. CBP agents have killed at least 97 people over the last 15 years.\n\nSecretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen, in particular, has become known for hiding the truth behind the administration\u2019s border enforcement policies. It took an extensive effort by government watchdogs for the public to get a glimpse of the secret memo revealing that she signed off on the policy of separating families \u2015 despite her statements under oath to the contrary. The memo \u2015 still largely redacted \u2015 also exposed that the intent of the policy was to drive fear and deter migrant families from trying to seek refuge. Missing from the memo was any plan to reunite separated families, with the devastating result that children are still missing even as the administration is considering a new family separation policy.\n\nThe administration\u2019s problematic secrecy extends south of the U.S.-Mexico border as well. Mexico\u2019s decision to use tear gas on the caravan and the recent killing of a Honduran migrant at Mexico\u2019s southern border suggest that, behind closed doors, Mexico is taking direction from Washington to implement a hard-line policy against asylum-seeking migrants. Mexico\u2019s ambassador to the U.S. has denied any deal between the countries on stopping the caravan but said his country was working \u201cvery closely with the United States government\u201d to address \u201cshared objectives regarding regional migration.\u201d\n\nWhat we do know, thanks to strategic use of transparency laws and targeted lawsuits, is that such shared objectives have lined the coffers of government contractors \u2014 Boeing, Dell, General Electric, IBM, Motorola, Raytheon and Sharp, to name a few. In fact, Washington has poured billions of dollars into private companies with little oversight in order to build up Mexico\u2019s security forces with training, greater wiretap capabilities, biometric databases, surveillance aircraft, satellites, all-terrain vehicles, Black Hawk helicopters and more. Previously hidden files have shown these contracts were doled out with little scrutiny and expose direct connections between these programs and security units involved in violations, such as extortion, kidnapping and massacres of people traveling north. Those files took years to pry loose from government agencies, and ongoing secrecy cripples the public and Congress from holding contractors accountable for waste and abuse.\n\nALFREDO ESTRELLA via Getty Images People traveling north from Central America play football at a temporary shelter in Mexico City on Nov. 5. Mexico\u2019s ambassador to the U.S. said his country was working \u201cvery closely with the United States government\u201d on regional migration.\n\nWhile the \u201cLeahy Laws\u201d strictly prohibit U.S. assistance to foreign security forces credibly believed to have committed a gross human rights violation, secrecy and cover-ups prevent the law from curbing aid for Mexico\u2019s police and military responsible for such abuses. Even after authorities discovered mass graves of hundreds of Central American migrants just south of the border, U.S. agencies shielded information on Mexico\u2019s cover-up of police involvement in the massacres as dollars continued to flow for immigration enforcement programs.\n\nSecrecy undermines informed decision-making about policies and practices that have enormous consequences. Far too often, the administration hides the truth behind our country\u2019s immigration policy and the fate of those seeking safety by ignoring obligations to report to Congress on immigration detention and border enforcement or lying about policies that have separated thousands of children from their parents. Such secrecy hinders Congress\u2019 ability to conduct oversight and means that costly litigation, at taxpayers\u2019 expense, is the often the only recourse for getting at the truth.\n\nAs immigration policy becomes increasingly shaped by clandestine maneuvering, the right to truth is vital to protect thousands of lives and to defend our country against increasingly authoritarian decision-making \u2014 at the border and beyond.\n\n\n\nJesse Franzblau is a policy analyst at Open the Government and a longtime freedom of information advocate specializing in use of transparency laws to document U.S. national security policy and human rights violations.", "Pete Davidson\u2019s joke about Republican candidate Dan Crenshaw didn\u2019t sit well with Meghan McCain.\n\nIn fact, \u201cThe View\u201d co-host argued on Monday that the comedian doesn\u2019t have the right to take pot shots at former military or disabled people.\n\nMcCain, whose father, Senator John McCain, was permanently injured in a Vietnamese prison for POWs, tweeted on Sunday that Davidson\u2019s joke was \u201cincredibly tone-deaf\u201d and \u201coffensive\u201d to veterans.\n\nThis is really awful and incredibly tone-deaf and offensive to veterans, their families and all who serve.

She was holding a press conference focused on health care at the Crescent Ballroom, a music venue on the outskirts of this city\u2019s downtown, when an unsurprising question came.\n\n\u201cDo you support \u2018Medicare for all\u2019?\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not,\u201d Sinema responded quickly to the reporter, later giving the same answer to a question about whether she supported adding a public health insurance option to Obamacare.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been laser-focused on supporting realistic proposals that help Arizonans get access to affordable coverage,\u201d she said. She went on to talk about her work with Republicans to delay a tax hike included in the Affordable Care Act and to increase the number of employees a small business must employ to 100 (instead of 15) before it is subject to the act.\n\nSinema is her party\u2019s nominee for U.S. Senate in this state. It\u2019s a former Republican bastion \u2015 home to Barry Goldwater, the founder of the modern conservative movement \u2015 that is slowly turning into a swing state. She\u2019s in a tight race with GOP Rep. Martha McSally, one of the first American women to fly in combat, in a race Democrats must win to have a chance of taking back the U.S. Senate.\n\nIf the contest here has been about one thing, it\u2019s health care. More than 1 million Arizonans have a pre-existing health condition, and Sinema and Democratic groups have relentlessly hammered McSally for her votes to repeal those protections in the Affordable Care Act. (McSally has responded by claiming to have \u201cled the fight\u201d to protect people with pre-existing conditions. She actually profanely encouraged other GOP members to vote for Obamacare repeal.)\n\nBut if the race has been about two things, the second thing is Sinema\u2019s past and ideology. National and state Republicans have relentlessly portrayed her as a far-left extremist, typically citing her work as an anti-war activist in the 2000s and early parts of her time in the Arizona State Legislature. They\u2019ve noted she danced with witches (yes, witches) and wore a pink tutu at an anti-war rally. They\u2019ve circulated videos of her calling Arizona\u2019s GOP-led legislature \u201ccrazy.\u201d The attacks culminated when McSally ignored a question about climate change at a debate and instead accused Sinema of \u201ctreason.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt Sinema once identified as a progressive. She began her political career as a spokeswoman for the Green Party. She told a radio host back in 2006 that she was the most liberal member of the Arizona State Legislature. She called herself a \u201cformer socialist\u201d at the Netroots Nation conference in 2006. In a 2002 letter to the editor of the Arizona Republic, she wrote that \u201ccapitalism damages [the] livelihood\u201d of the \u201caverage American\u201d and railed against the World Trade Organization and NAFTA. Even on health care, Sinema\u2019s website for her 2002 run for Phoenix City Council promised she would \u201cwork towards a system of universal health care\u201d and wanted to remove \u201cthe profit-making element\u201d from health care.\n\nMcSally has relentlessly used this record to portray Sinema as a radical. \u201cShe\u2019s extreme and out of touch and out of the mainstream,\u201d McSally said Friday night on Fox News\u2019 \u201cThe Ingraham Angle.\u201d \u201cShe is in the liberal witness protection program right now.\u201d\n\nBut that\u2019s not who Sinema is anymore. Or if it is, she\u2019s been hiding it for more than half of her career in elected office. She\u2019s now the type of moderate more likely to punch a hippie, metaphorically speaking, than to dance with them. A look at her record, combined with interviews with Democrats and progressives in the state \u2015 many of whom didn\u2019t want to go on the record criticizing their party\u2019s best chance to win statewide office since Janet Napolitano\u2019s gubernatorial victory in 2006 \u2015 show a politician who is willing to buck progressive wishes and sometimes seems to go out of her way to aggravate the left.\n\nWhile other Democrats in heavily diverse Sun Belt states \u2015 Stacey Abrams in Georgia, Andrew Gillum in Florida and David Garcia in Arizona \u2015 are trying to juice up minority turnout and expand the electorate, Sinema is equally focused on wooing independents and Republicans, while hoping progressives stay in line.\n\nHer allies argue this approach reflects what the majority of Arizonans want in a senator. \u201cThey\u2019ve called everybody a liberal, and it doesn\u2019t work. Voters trust Sinema more than these Republicans who are calling wolf all the time,\u201d said Rep. Ruben Gallego, a progressive Democrat who represents a district adjacent to Sinema\u2019s. \u201cShe\u2019s the one who\u2019s passing legislation and is working across the aisle.\u201d They just might be right.\n\nSo far, Democrats feel confident the strategy is working. Democrats believe Sinema, who has aired multiple ads on Spanish-language televisions and speaks the language fluently, is turning out the Hispanic voters she needs to win. And while Republicans still lead in early ballot returns, their margin is down to just under 8 percentage points. The GOP usually has about a 12-point edge in midterm elections, according to the Arizona Republic.\n\nA Shift In Focus\n\nFiguring out exactly how and why Sinema went from left to center isn\u2019t easy. Her campaign turned down a request for an interview. A 170-page book she wrote in 2009, titled Unite and Conquer, explains her embrace of deal-making, if not quite her embrace of centrism.\n\nIn the book, Sinema writes she entered the state legislature in 2004 as a \u201cbomb-thrower\u201d and spent her first two years in office frustrated, accomplishing little. She opted instead to start working with Republicans, even hard-line ones, to pass legislation.\n\nCaitlin O'Hara for HuffPost Sinema answers questions at a campaign event in Phoenix on Oct. 24.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d spent all my time being a crusader for justice, a patron saint for lost causes, and I\u2019d missed out on the opportunity to form meaningful relationships with fellow members in the legislature, lobbyists, and other state actors,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI hadn\u2019t gotten any of my great policies enacted into law, and I\u2019d seen lots of stuff I didn\u2019t like become law. It was just plain sad.\u201d\n\nGallego, who served in the legislature with Sinema, said the future congresswoman was just finding a way to get things done. \u201cYou have to work with Republicans to pass anything in Arizona, and that\u2019s what her constituents demanded of her,\u201d he said in a phone interview.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what happened. She notes she was able to pass legislation protecting breastfeeding mothers from indecent exposure charges \u2015 something Democrats in the state had sought to do for years \u2015 by teaming up with a Republican legislator and by framing the bill in a conservative-friendly way.\n\n\u201cThe framing was perfect,\u201d she wrote. \u201cRather than talk about breast-feeding as a \u2018woman\u2019s rights\u2019 issue (which Democrats had done for years), they talked about a mother\u2019s need to take care of her baby (which Republicans can understand and connect with.)\u201d\n\nThe experience, she writes, made her realize she enjoyed passing legislation more than she enjoyed attacking her political opponents.\n\n\u201cI do love to give fiery speeches,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBut I also love people. I love talking with people, working together, and making friends.\u201d\n\nSyrian Refugees, A Letter And A T-shirt\n\nBy the time Sinema was elected to Congress in 2012, she was a full-fledged moderate. She became a favorite of House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) and an annoyance to his more liberal boss, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). She joined the Blue Dog Caucus, a shrinking group of conservative Democrats, and the New Democrats, a group of pro-business members who mostly hail from suburban areas. She earned the endorsement of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in 2014. Since the beginning of President Donald Trump\u2019s administration, she has voted with him nearly two-thirds of the time.\n\nA few weeks before launching her Senate bid, rumors began to swirl that Trump was going to pardon the state\u2019s notorious former Maricopa County sheriff, Joe Arpaio, who was convicted for criminal contempt of court. In August, a letter asking the president not to pardon Arpaio was signed by every Democratic member of the Arizona congressional delegation \u2015 except Sinema. Despite this, multiple progressives in the state noted Sinema\u2019s campaign has sent out dozens of online fundraising missives invoking Arpaio. (As recently as last week, a Sinema email noted Vice President Mike Pence was visiting Arizona. \u201cThe last time he was here, he attacked Kyrsten and praised convicted criminal Joe Arpaio!\u201d the email read.)\n\nA number of Democratic eyebrows also shot up after Sinema released the first digital ad of her campaign. In the spot, meant to highlight her independence, as well as her support for law enforcement and veterans, her brother Paul is clearly wearing a T-shirt with a \u201cBlue Lives Matter\u201d logo. The Blue Lives Matter movement, which aims to make attacks on police a hate crime, is seen as a countervailing force to the progressive Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nThe biggest issue, though, is her voting record: Sinema, like many other moderate Democrats, voted for the rollback of some Dodd-Frank banking regulations. In 2015, she voted for a tougher screening process for Syrian and Iraqi refugees. In September, she was just one of three Democrats who voted to make parts of the Republican tax cut permanent. She was just one of 12 Democrats to vote to expand access to health savings accounts, which the GOP has pushed as an alternative to Obamacare. And she\u2019s voted for Trump-backed legislation that increased penalties for people who re-enter the country illegally.\n\nA Notable Non-endorsement\n\nThe evening before Sinema\u2019s health care press conference, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders held a rally at Arizona State University for David Garcia, the Democratic candidate in the gubernatorial race. A who\u2019s who of Arizona Democratic activists and officials took the stage, but they never mentioned Sinema.\n\nAnd there\u2019s good reason for that: She hasn\u2019t endorsed Garcia, who has run as an electorate-expanding progressive in favor of increasing education spending, abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement and enacting \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d In many states, this would cause no shortage of political howling. For Sinema, it\u2019s standard operating procedure \u2015 Democrats noted she never endorsed Democratic Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick\u2019s 2016 Senate bid against Republican Sen. John McCain.\n\nDemocrats have downplayed the dispute. \u201cIt only comes up when folks like you ask about it,\u201d Garcia told HuffPost. But the lack of outcry also shows how progressives are mostly swallowing their medicine and supporting Sinema, despite their grumbles.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d rather stand with someone who stands with 50 percent of our values than none of our values,\u201d said Brianna Westbrook, a former Democratic congressional candidate in the state who\u2019s working with the Working Families Party of Arizona to turn out voters for Garcia. But she added: \u201cShe\u2019s really alienated a lot of voters, especially in our black and brown communities.\u201d\n\nBefore Garcia won the primary in August, both he and his opponent, state Sen. Steve Farley, predicted they wouldn\u2019t have any difficulty running alongside a more centrist candidate like Sinema.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s doing what she thinks is important for her strategy, and I\u2019ve got to respect that, because I\u2019ve never met anybody more ambitious,\u201d Farley said.\n\nA few hours after her Phoenix press conference, Sinema was at a coffee shop, where she was launching a \u201cTeachers for Sinema\u201d canvass. Educators in Arizona have exploded in activism this year, storming the state Capitol as part of a movement dubbed #RedForEd.\n\nCaitlin O'Hara for HuffPost Supporters of #RedForEd hold signs touting Sinema on Oct. 24 in Phoenix.\n\nThe top goal of the #RedForEd movement? Ousting GOP Gov. Doug Ducey. But in a radio interview earlier this month, Sinema declined to reveal whether she voted for Ducey or Garcia. (Asked if she was proud to be a Democrat, Sinema responded: \u201cI\u2019m not sure that people are even proud of parties anymore, because I feel like the parties are not doing a good job. So I would say that I\u2019m a proud Arizonan.\u201d)\n\nBut despite her disagreement on their main goal, the teachers in attendance raved about Sinema, noting her life story \u2015 she grew up in poverty and graduated from high school at age 16 \u2015 matched that of so many of their students. While some allowed they would prefer a more liberal candidate, they would take what they could get.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re so lucky to have somebody on the ballot who will fight for us on health care and education,\u201d Marisol Garcia said to a round of applause from the gathered teachers. (Sinema, who started her career as a school social worker, was once a member of the union. She\u2019s since earned a law degree, a Ph.D. in justice studies and an MBA.)\n\nRepublicans have tried to exploit the gaps between Sinema and the left wing of her party. Over the last weekend of the election, they sent out mailers tying Sanders to Angela Green, the aptly named Green Party nominee in the Senate contest. The mailers, which noted Green\u2019s support for \u201cMedicare for all\u201d and legalized marijuana, looked like a clear attempt to draw progressive support away from the Democratic nominee.\n\nA Sanders spokesman never addressed whether the Vermont senator supported Sinema. \u201cBernie Sanders has been traveling the country visiting 13 states to try and end one party rule in Washington by electing Democrats up and down the ballot,\u201d spokesman Josh Miller-Lewis wrote in an email.\n\nDemocrats in the state say there\u2019s no evidence of mass liberal defections during the state\u2019s extensive early voting period, and Sinema hasn\u2019t made any adjustments to her strategy, continuing to portray herself as above petty partisan squabbles.\n\n\u201cI know together we will elect an Arizona senator who will be a voice for all Arizonans, not just one political party,\u201d Sinema told the teachers.\n\nAnd in the end, Arizona progressives will take a post-partisan over a staunch Trump ally like McSally.\n\n\u201cIt frustrates a lot of people,\u201d Westbrook said of Sinema\u2019s moderate politics. Still, she held out some hope Sinema could be persuaded: \u201cOnce she\u2019s in office, we\u2019ll be able to push her.\u201d\n\nThis story has been updated with information on Hispanic voters and early ballot returns.", "NOW PLAYING\n\nThe Woman Who Flipped Off Trump\u2019s Motorcade Is Now Running For Office\n\nIn 2017, Juli Briskman went for a bike ride and became a symbol for the resistance against Trump.

She fundraises like a beast. She knows how to cut a winning deal with Republicans, even when she\u2019s in the minority. She\u2019s demonized by the right as a liberal monster, and she\u2019s under pressure from some in her caucus to step aside and let a younger generation take charge.\n\nAfter 31 years in the House and 17 years in Democratic leadership, including her historic tenure as speaker, Pelosi is confident about two things ahead of Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections: that Democrats will win back the House, and that she\u2019s the best one to lead them forward as speaker once again.\n\n\u201cI know the territory,\u201d Pelosi said in a recent interview, between bites of a chocolate gelato waffle cone in a suburban Maryland cafe. \u201cAnd I\u2019m really good at what I do.\u201d\n\nThe California Democrat is already talking about how she\u2019ll run the House. The first bill she wants to pass is a package of anti-corruption and voting rights reforms. She has no interest in impeaching Donald Trump, despite some on her left flank eager to do this on day one. Instead, she plans to push ahead with the policy issues she\u2019s advocated for years. Lower health care costs. Bigger paychecks for the middle class. Protections for the environment.\n\nShe also wants committee chairs to begin conducting real oversight of the Trump administration, which Republicans have refused to do for the past two years. If that means issuing subpoenas to administration officials \u2015 something Democrats on the House oversight and government reform committee asked the GOP majority to do 52 times over the last year and a half, only to be denied each time \u2015 so be it.\n\n\u201cWe have to be strategic, not scattershot,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it has to be for the purpose of getting the truth as to how they are conducting their agencies.\u201d\n\nJennifer Bendery \"This is the most important election of our time,\" Pelosi told attendees at a campaign event for Maryland congressional candidate David Trone in October. \"We say that every election. But this time we mean it.\"\n\nThat Pelosi is mapping out her speakership before waiting to see if Democrats win control of the House (it\u2019s looking likely) and if she can secure her re-election as speaker (that\u2019s a little more murky) tells you either she\u2019s got a spine literally made of titanium, or she\u2019s crunched enough numbers, and privately lined up enough support in her caucus and among candidates, to feel good about keeping her leadership post.\n\nIt certainly looks like the latter. As Politico reported, Pelosi has been quietly courting Democratic candidates who have publicly kept her at a distance. She\u2019s sent donors to them. She\u2019s appeared at private fundraisers for them. She\u2019s sent more than 30 of her staffers to toss-up districts to help. Her main goal may be to win back the House, but it doesn\u2019t hurt to endear herself to those candidates along the way.\n\nIf she does become speaker, she\u2019ll be negotiating directly with Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on all major policy matters. That\u2019s the kind of working relationship one might like to observe as a fly on the wall, given Pelosi\u2019s open disdain for Trump\u2019s rhetoric and policies. Just last week, she said the only thing that sets him apart from the rest of his party is his \u201cpersonal grotesqueness.\u201d\n\nThe California Democrat says she has no problem working with him, though, because she respects the office of the president and the roles they each play.\n\n\u201cSometimes I respect the office more than he does, from what I see of his behavior,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cI think those rooms have to be transparent. This is what the purpose is, to not allow them to misrepresent. The president, he just either has no affinity for fact or no desire to convey it. We can\u2019t let the fate of the nation depend on that.\u201d\n\nAs for McConnell, Pelosi said she\u2019s worked closely with him for years and they are both former appropriators, which serves them well in high-level talks on funding. She might feel her experience has served her a bit better.\n\n\u201cThat is a lot of what we negotiate,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that is why it\u2019s interesting for us to win every appropriation fight because they just, well, they just don\u2019t win.\u201d\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS If she becomes speaker, Pelosi thinks transparency will be key to working with President Donald Trump, since he lies and makes stuff up a lot.\n\nPelosi isn\u2019t speaker yet, though. And she knows that some in her caucus are eager to shake up leadership. One of the criticisms she\u2019s gotten is that at 78, she\u2019s too old to keep leading the caucus, despite her male counterparts like McConnell, 76, or Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), 67, not facing those same criticisms.\n\n\u201cIt is sexist,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if there\u2019s misogyny, there\u2019s also a big upside in women. I feel confident about women, and many men, who say \u2018My daughter can now do this and that and this because of you.\u2019 I don\u2019t spend too much time thinking about it... What is important to me in all of this is that women just ignore it.\u201d\n\nStill, she can\u2019t be in charge forever. She recently started referring to herself as a \u201ctransitional speaker,\u201d signaling that she\u2019s ready to usher in generational change. That caught the attention of many in her caucus who want to know more: What does that mean, exactly? What are her plans for two years from now?\n\nPelosi would not go into any of those specifics. She also wouldn\u2019t name people in her caucus whom she sees as potential new leaders of the party. But she said it \u201cdoesn\u2019t bother [her] at all\u201d that younger Democrats are eager to move up in the food chain.\n\n\u201cI have for a long time tried to have a path for other people to take over,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have to go out there to get a following. They have to show their legislative chops. There are any number of people who could do that.\u201d\n\nThe president, he just either has no affinity for fact or no desire to convey it. We can\u2019t let the fate of the nation depend on that. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.)\n\nOf course, by signaling that it\u2019s time for a generational change in leadership, Pelosi has essentially boxed out her top two lieutenants, Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (Md.) and Assistant Democratic Leader Jim Clyburn (S.C.), both in their late 70s, from becoming speaker.\n\nHuffPost proposed that Pelosi let Hoyer be speaker for a week, just to experience the glory after being her No. 2 for so long. She wasn\u2019t into it.\n\n\u201cWhat would be the purpose?\u201d she said with a confused laugh. \u201cThat can\u2019t be a serious question.\u201d\n\nSo... the answer is \u201cno\u201d to a weeklong taste of the nectar for Hoyer?", "\u201cI guess I think maybe it\u2019s just because we\u2019re talking about Dermot [Mulroney].

The story takes place over the course of a single summer, and follows Maia, a cisgender girl grieving the loss of her older sister, and Chris, a boy who has recently come out as transgender. Both characters find a kindred spirit in the other, as both are trying to find their place in the world following a life-changing experience.\n\nSimon & Schuster Children\u2019s Publishing\n\nSmith, whose previous books include 2016\u2032s The Way I Used to Be and The Last to Let Go, released early this year, told HuffPost she initially conceived of Something Like Gravity as two separate books, but ultimately decided, \u201cThe thing that was missing from their stories was each other.\u201d\n\n\u201cI found that the focus of this new book naturally shifted away from the struggles of coming out and grieving,\u201d she said, \u201cbut instead centered on this relationship and how, in the midst of all the awkwardness and sweetness and scariness of first love, this love was also challenging what each character thought they knew about life, the world and, most of all, themselves.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times bestselling author also incorporated her own experiences as a queer woman into the book and, specifically, the character of Chris.\n\n\u201cWhen I was young and beginning to realize I was a lesbian, I did not see a strong representation of who I was anywhere in my life, and certainly not in literature,\u201d Smith said. Citing authors like David Levithan, Emily M. Danforth and Becky Abertelli, who\u2019ve made inclusive strides with their recent books, she noted, \u201cWhile I am not transgender, I connect to what trans youth are going through right now as being parallel to my own coming out and coming-of-age experience.\u201d\n\n\u201cI always write about topics that have affected me personally, and taking on LGBTQ equality and queer rights in my writing felt like a natural next step,\u201d she continued. \u201cThere is nothing I know of that opens minds and hearts better than sharing our stories, and I hope that through my work I can help in some small way to break down barriers so we can keep things moving forward for everyone.\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t know about it.

And they certainly are effective, based on the numbers that we\u2019re seeing,\u201d Trump said.\n\nHe then remarked about \u201coffensive\u201d questions from reporters, continuing his longtime hostility toward the press.", "This year, Democrats riding what may be a once-in-a-generation blue wave obliterated their old records for fundraising and spending.\n\nBut you might not know that if you were working for them.\n\nThat\u2019s the clear conclusion of a survey of the field staff of the Ohio Democratic coordinated campaign, the group largely responsible for Democrats\u2019 voter registration, persuasion and get-out-the-vote efforts in the country\u2019s second-biggest swing state. The survey, which was initiated by the workers\u2019 union, offered a detailed snapshot of some of the struggles that are endemic to campaign life, such as financial difficulties and a culture of employees plowing their paychecks right back into the campaign.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a sustainable career,\u201d said Sarah Willenbrink-Sahin, a regional field director. The campaign worker life, she added, is virtually off-limits to anyone who has health issues, family obligations or lacks a substantial financial safety net. \u201cCampaign workers are either subsidized or struggling. There\u2019s not much in between.\u201d\n\nWorkers for the coordinated campaign reported working an average of 11 hours a day and 6 to 7 days a week at a time when most of them earned a $3,000 a month; a handful earned $3,500 or $4,000, and the workers\u2019 union later negotiated for a modest raise. The respondents\u2019 average hourly wage was not \u201ca living wage which the Democratic party supposedly supports,\u201d Willenbrink-Sahin said, but $10.24 an hour, according to HuffPost\u2019s calculations.\n\nCampaign workers are either subsidized or struggling. There\u2019s not much in between. Sarah Willenbrink-Sahin, regional field director\n\nAnd a lot of those earnings went right back into the campaign. One thing the survey strived to capture is all the various ways campaign employees pay to elect their own candidates. A majority of workers indicated they\u2019d spent at least $200 on campaign-related expenses such as office supplies, food for volunteers, driving expenses and parking tickets (a ubiquitous feature of driving in unfamiliar cities). Every worker except for three said the job required them to have a car. Those employees paid out-of-pocket for their auto insurance (an average of $131.15 a month) and car payments (an average of $331.60 a month for those making payments), and only a handful reported receiving a stipend for gas. On average, they put 253 miles per week on their personal vehicles.\n\nIn the same period they were supporting the campaign, roughly half of workers had to skip out on paying for something important, such as a prescription or a car repair.\n\n\u201cIn a lot of ways, it feels like we\u2019re paying to work,\u201d said Jake McClelland, who works as a recruitment coordinator. From where he was standing, he could see that his Toyota Corolla would need new tires as soon as the election was over. He\u2019s driven his car 15,000 miles and had the oil changed three times since April. \u201cWhen you look at what the Democrats fundraised and then you look at your paycheck, it\u2019s not coming down to us.\u201d\n\nThe survey speaks to some of the factors which keep low-income, nonwhite people out of politics and make the career unsustainable for many people over the long run. In Ohio, it\u2019s easy to see how burnout could undo the work Democrats are hoping to accomplish. The state is heavily gerrymandered to favor Republicans and the map won\u2019t change before 2020. This means that even if they swamp their defenses this year, the Democrats will have to put up a similar effort to defend those gains just two years from now.\n\nThe Ohio coordinated campaign, which registers and persuades thousands of voters, dispatches local volunteers, and runs the last-minute get-out-the-vote effort, represents the tip of the spear.\n\nThis summer, a HuffPost analysis of 1,000 salaries found that the median monthly salary for a staffer working on a Democratic congressional race was $2,632. That works out to $15 an hour or more for any staffers working less than 40 hours a week. But the typical campaign staffer works twice that much. Democrats have put much of their record fundraising instead toward a record amount of advertising.\n\nAll of this defies factors that could have made 2018 a windfall year for ordinary campaign workers. In addition to smashing their previous fundraising records, Democrats are running on broad themes of economic equality and fielding dozens of candidates who support a $15 minimum wage. (More than 150 of their candidates for the House are incumbents who co-sponsored a $15 federal minimum wage bill, HuffPost found.) And Democrats are fielding so many qualified candidates, in so many races where they usually field none, that campaign managers told HuffPost they struggled this cycle to fill crucial slots.\n\nA nascent trend of campaign workers organizing into unions may be changing things. After the survey took place \u2014 about 30 out of 80 field staff employed at the time responded \u2014 employees of the Ohio Democratic coordinated campaign and their union, the Campaign Workers Guild, negotiated for starting salaries of $3,150 and stipends to help cover their phones and auto expenses.\n\n\u201cWe are proud to be the first state party in the nation to reach a contract with CWG for our coordinated campaign workers, and we are firmly committed to building a more sustainable progressive movement that invests in its workers as one of our most important resources,\u201d said Kirstin Alvanitakis, a spokeswoman for the Ohio Democrats. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that campaign work is and always will be tough, grueling even, but it can be rewarding like nothing else. We will continue to encourage Democratic candidates and campaigns to treat their workers with the dignity that all working men and women deserve \u2015 and we are proud to have set the example of how to do just that.\u201d\n\nOther burdens will prove harder to address. Many of the respondents said the hours they worked made it difficult to maintain relationships, attend family functions, or observe religious events. To a person, they said their schedules made it next to impossible to shop for groceries or cook a meal. On a scale of 1 to 5, nearly everyone who responded put their agreement with the following statement at a 4 or a 5: \u201cI like working on campaigns, but I have a hard time envisioning a sustainable career for myself as a campaign worker.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s no easy fix, during an election, for the dizzying stakes and the unmovable deadline.", "NBC via Getty Images \"In all honesty therapy has saved my life so many times,\" Ariana Grande tweeted.\n\nAriana Grande is quickly becoming a source of inspiration when it comes to talking about mental health.\n\nThe \u201cGod is a Woman\u201d singer replied to a fan\u2019s tweet about therapy on Monday, praising the power of seeing a mental health professional and encouraging others to reach out for help if they\u2019re struggling.\n\n\u201cIn all honesty therapy has saved my life so many times,\u201d Grande wrote. \u201cIf you\u2019re afraid to ask for help, don\u2019t be.

Experts say that when people in the public eye are candid about their own mental health conditions, it can eradicate stigma and encourage people to reach out for support. And in a world where mental health issues are on the rise, particularly among young people, there\u2019s no such thing as too much awareness.", "Coral! Where\u2019s Coral? Has anyone seen Coral?\n\nThroughout nine seasons of \u201cThe Walking Dead,\u201d Carl Grimes (Chandler Riggs) has factored heavily into Rick Grimes\u2019 personal saga, which came to an end on the series Sunday night. In his final episodes, Andrew Lincoln\u2019s character brought up his dead son\u2019s name several times, reminiscing about the better world he wanted to create.\n\nBut when it came down to it, our guy Coral was MIA during Grime\u2019s finale. Happy trails, cowboy?\n\nBefore Rick led a herd of zombies to their watery grave this week and (spoiler alert) made his own exit on a helicopter, Mr. Grimes suffered a series of hallucinations, in which three past \u201cWalking Dead\u201d characters appeared to offer him advice. They included: Shane (Jon Bernthal), Hershel (Scott Wilson) and Sasha (Sonequa Martin-Green). Much to fans\u2019 chagrin, Carl was nowhere to be found. For that matter, Lori Grimes (Sarah Wayne Callies), Rick\u2019s dead ex and the show\u2019s resident terrible driver, was also notably absent.\n\nWhat gives, the internet wondered? \u201cWalking Dead\u201d showrunner Angela Kang jumped on the phone with HuffPost on Monday to answer the people\u2019s question: Why didn\u2019t Carl show up?\n\n\u201cThere is a reason,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe dove into this idea of the \u2018third man phenomenon,\u2019\u201d Kang said. \u201cWhen people are close to death, sometimes they imagine seeing somebody that they knew or that they don\u2019t know that helped drive them to survive and keep them going. We had these three particular characters [Shane, Hershel and Sasha] who are sort of filling an emotional need for him in the moment, but Rick\u2019s entire journey is looking for his family, and I felt, creatively felt, that if he sees Lori or Carl he would feel like, \u2018OK, I fulfilled my mission. I found them. I\u2019m home. I can lay down and die now.\u2019\u201d\n\nShe continued: \u201cHe needed to keep going for the family that is still there, and so to have that kind of restlessness of like, \u2018I still haven\u2019t found them. Where are they? Where are they?\u2019 bringing him back to realizing his family has always been there all along \u2015 that the people he\u2019s fighting for now are still his family \u2015 that\u2019s what keeps him going. So he can\u2019t find them, otherwise it\u2019d be too easy for him to give up.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why Carl and Lori didn\u2019t appear in the episode \u2014 though Lori\u2019s voice made a cameo for astute listeners.\n\nIn his final episode, Rick hears a number of voices mutter \u201cWhat\u2019s your wound?,\u201d a callback to some of the first words Morgan (Lennie James) said to Rick on the show. One of those voices was Lori Grimes herself.\n\n\u201cShe says, \u2018What\u2019s your wound?\u2019 before he sees Shane,\u201d Kang revealed. \u201cEach \u2018What\u2019s your wound?\u2019 is kind of connected to the hallucination he\u2019s having in the moment.\u201d\n\nGene Page/AMC May the Force be with you, Judith.\n\nSo we didn\u2019t get Lori or Carl, but the episode did involve a time jump that landed on a preteen Judith Grimes, played by actress Cailey Fleming. Fleming\u2019s most notable role outside of \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d remains her turn as young Rey in \u201cStar Wars,\u201d a fact Kang jokingly confirmed helps explain the Jedi\u2019s true parentage: Rick Grimes is Rey\u2019s dad.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d said Kang with a laugh. \u201cWell, you know, Cailey came in and just blew us all away. She was amazing, and I\u2019m a huge \u2018Star Wars\u2019 universe fan as is [creative content officer Scott Gimple], as is a lot of people on our show. So that was very exciting for us to have little Rey on our show.\u201d\n\nKang addressed one last question that\u2019s been haunting fans who wondered about the dark, seemingly potty-less cell housing Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan). Yes, the Saviors leader does have a place to go to the bathroom. It\u2019s called a bed pan.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t see it here, but [the bed pan] does feature in a very prominent moment later on this season,\u201d Kang said. \u201cOr he might even have a bucket at this point, but we really wanted to shroud that cell in so much darkness that the corners are very black.\u201d", "LAKE HALLIE, Wis. (AP) \u2014 A young driver was inhaling chemical vapors, or huffing, just prior to striking and killing three Girl Scouts and a mother and critically injuring a fourth girl who had been picking up trash along a rural Wisconsin highway, police said Monday.\n\nColten Treu, 21, sped off after the collision in Lake Hallie Saturday morning, but later surrendered.\n\nTreu was being held in the Chippewa County Jail on 13 possible charges, including four counts of intoxicated use of a motor vehicle, Chippewa County Sheriff\u2019s Sgt. Robert Jensen said. His bond was set at $250,000 during his first court appearance Monday morning.\n\nLake Hallie police said Monday Treu and a passenger in the pickup truck both told investigators they had intentionally been inhaling chemical vapors just prior to the crash.\n\nLake Hallie police said Monday that the deceased were: 9-year-old Jayna Kelley and 10-year-old Autum Helgeson, both of Lake Hallie, and 10-year-old Haylee Hickle and her 32-year-old mother, Sara Jo Schneider, from the Town of Lafayette.\n\nThe surviving girl was hospitalized in Rochester in critical condition.\n\nThe children were all fourth graders at Halmstad Elementary School and Southview Elementary School in nearby Chippewa Falls, about 90 miles (145 kilometers) east of Minneapolis.\n\nTwo small groups of Girl Scouts and their adult chaperones wore bright green safety vests Saturday as they walked along both sides of County Highway P, which they had adopted as a community service project.\n\nLake Hallie police Sgt. Daniel Sokup said Saturday that Treu\u2019s black Ford F-150 crossed a lane Saturday morning and veered into a roadside ditch, striking the victims.\n\nHundreds of community members huddled under umbrellas in the biting rain Sunday evening for a candlelight vigil outside Halmstad Elementary. Girl Scouts sang songs in memory of the victims, who were members of Troop 3055. A makeshift memorial of teddy bears, balloons and candles was set up on two wooden benches.\n\n\u201cOur hearts are broken for the girls and families of the Girl Scouts of the Northwestern Great Lakes,\u201d CEO Sylvia Acevedo of Girl Scouts of the USA said in a statement Sunday. \u201cThe Girl Scout Movement everywhere stands with our sister Girl Scouts in Wisconsin to grieve and comfort one another in the wake of this terrible tragedy.\u201d", "An Australian man who became paralyzed after eating a slug on a dare eight years ago has died at the age of 28.\n\nSam Ballard, who was a rugby player before the incident, reportedly died in a Sydney hospital on Friday surrounded by family and friends, according to the Independent.\n\nIn 2010, Ballard, who was 19 at the time, consumed a slug on the drunken urging of friends, according to Yahoo. He seemed OK until he complained of a sharp pain in his legs a few days later.\n\nTests showed that Ballard\u2019s brain had been infected with rat lungworm, a parasite sometimes found in slugs. He contracted eosinophilic meningoencephalitis \u2015 a form of meningitis \u2015 and fell into a coma that lasted 420 days.\n\nHe spent the next three years in a hospital. Ballard was left paralyzed and had to use a wheelchair for the rest of his life, often suffering seizures.\n\nHis story was big news in Australia, especially last year when his disability insurance was slashed by more than half. As a result of media coverage, the decision was later reversed, according to the Grafton Daily Examiner.\n\nBallard\u2019s death was announced on the Australian news show \u201cThe Sunday Project\u201d by broadcaster Lisa Wilkinson.

We took it on in 2017 and we\u2019ll take it on again in 2018,\u201d DLCC executive director Jessica Post said on a call with reporters on Thursday.\n\nDemocrats have the opportunity to take over the state Senate in New York, Colorado, Maine, Wisconsin, Arizona and New Hampshire, and state Houses in Minnesota, Iowa and Michigan, among other places.\n\nThe party has already flipped 44 legislative seats in off-year and special elections since 2016, including a November 2017 win in Washington state that put the state Senate in Democratic hands. Democrats now have unified control of state government in the Evergreen State.\n\nThe additional pickups on Tuesday would lay the groundwork for a strong showing in the 2020 elections, which will determine control of the redistricting process in the vast majority of states.\n\nDemocrats\u2019 stunning blowouts at the state level in the midterm elections of 2010, the last census year, locked them out of redistricting in a host of states. The losses allowed Republicans to gerrymander Congressional seats and maintain an iron hold on the U.S. House for eight years.\n\nIn addition, dominance of governorships and state legislatures empowered Republicans to radically reshape policy in ways that provided them long-term political advantages \u2015 not least in historically Democratic parts of the Midwest.\n\nManka Dhingra/Facebook Manka Dhingra, right, speakers to voters in July 2017. Dhingra's November 2017 win in a Washington state Senate election won Democrats unified control of state government.\n\nSpecifically, Republican governors and state governments have engaged in aggressive voter suppression tactics and prioritized gutting labor unions, which are typically an influential source of campaign cash and voter mobilization for Democrats.\n\n\u201cThese weren\u2019t your granddaddy\u2019s Republicans,\u201d said Tim Waters, political director of the United Steelworkers union. \u201cThe first thing they did is try to get their boot on our throat, because they see unions as the thing standing between them and their unfettered agenda.\u201d\n\nSince 2010 alone, Republican state governments have passed right-to-work laws, which bar unions from requiring dues payment from workers they represent, in five states: Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Wisconsin and West Virginia. (Missouri voters overturned a 2017 right-to-work law in an August referendum.)\n\nIn Iowa, which has been a right-to-work state since 1947, a Republican takeover of the state Senate in 2016 enabled them to cripple remaining bastions of union power. With unified GOP control, the state government severely limited public sector collective bargaining and barred state and local contracting rules that favored construction unions.\n\nIn an October interview in his Des Moines office, Iowa Federation of Labor president Ken Sagar said the stakes of the election were \u201ccritical\u201d for Iowa\u2019s embattled unions.\n\n\u201cWe need to elect people who are supporting working families in order to fundamentally ensure the survival of the labor movement in this state,\u201d Sagar said.\n\nElection Day is on track to be a good day for Sagar: In addition to the prospect of retaking the state House, Democrat Fred Hubbell has a slight lead in public polling of the governor\u2019s race.\n\nA reckoning with the devastation of state-level Democratic power and the rank-and-file disinterest that drives it has been a decade in the making. From 2009 to 2014, Democrats lost over 900 state legislative seats, only beginning to rebound in 2015.\n\nWhen it comes to governorships, the party hit a low point in mid-2017 when it controlled just 15 of the country\u2019s governors\u2019 mansions. Republicans currently have 26 \u201ctrifectas,\u201d or states where they control both legislative chambers and the governorship; Democrats merely have eight.\n\nThe Democratic turnaround in state-level elections this year is the product of a collective realization among donors, activists and elected officials that states can no longer be ignored. Many grassroots Democratic donors eager to pitch in were lured in by the knowledge that, unlike hyper-expensive congressional contests, smaller donations have an outsize impact in state legislative races.\n\nAs a result, the DLCC, long the most overlooked of national party committees, had a banner fundraising cycle, spending a record $35 million on legislative races.\n\nThe Democratic Governors Association also raised a record $121 million this cycle, putting the party in strong position to flip upwards of six governorships.\n\nTo buttress official party resources, a staggering number of outside funders and activist groups have cropped up since the 2016 election to assist in the less glamorous work of flipping GOP-held state legislative seats.\n\nThe super PAC Forward Majority has spent $9 million to elect Democrats in over 120 seats in six states, the bulk of it on digital advertising and direct mail.\n\nThe National Democratic Redistricting Committee, a group founded by former Attorney General Eric Holder, raised nearly $11 million in 2017 with the goal of influencing the post-2020 redistricting processes. NDRC employs a multi-pronged approach that includes litigation and the development ballot initiatives, of which elections are just one part, but it is spending $750,000 on a field organizing effort with For Our Future, a joint venture of organized labor and liberal billionaire Tom Steyer.\n\nThe digital startups Sister District and Flippable enable nationwide Democratic activists to volunteer time and money to winning state legislative seats across the country.\n\nA whole lot of people have found religion on state legislatures, but unfortunately they stop at gerrymandering. That\u2019s just the beginning. Daniel Squadron, Future Now Fund\n\nAnd Tech for Campaigns has marshaled the resources of Democratic tech professionals to build technology and perform volunteer digital work for state legislative campaigns. This year, the group has dispatched volunteers to 117 campaigns in 17 states, including 25 campaigns in Arizona alone, where the group effectively runs digital organizing for state House and Senate Democrats.\n\nThe Future Now Fund, a new PAC that is spending $4 million on key legislative races in Arizona, Michigan, Maine, North Carolina and New Hampshire, has formed a direct partnership with Tech for Campaigns in Arizona. The anger over school funding and pay that prompted a massive teachers strike in April has given Democrats a shot at flipping the state Senate there.\n\n\u201cOne of the major challenges at the state legislative level is getting high-quality work since the profit just isn\u2019t as high for consultants. Tech for Campaigns fills that gap,\u201d said Daniel Squadron, executive director of Future Now.\n\nSquadron is an evangelist for caring about state legislature races beyond the impact they have on gerrymandering.\n\n\u201cA whole lot of people have found religion on state legislatures but unfortunately they stop at gerrymandering. That\u2019s just the beginning,\u201d he said, noting the disproportionate impact states have on labor rights, environmental rules, women\u2019s rights and antitrust regulation.\n\nTo that end, Future Now also has a nonprofit arm that embeds itself in state legislatures after elections are over to provide policy and political expertise for Democratic lawmakers.\n\nThe vast majority of state legislatures are part time and have small staff budgets, putting Democrats at a disadvantage against well-funded conservative and corporate front groups like the American Legislative Exchange Council, or ALEC. Future Now has successful solicited 388 candidates and legislators to pledge support for their seven goals: \u201cgood jobs,\u201d \u201caffordable quality health care,\u201d lifelong education, campaign finance reform and political transparency, civil rights, infrastructure investment and a clean environment.\n\nIn many state legislative races, however, the most influential players are the same Facebook-based, anti-Trump Resistance groups powering congressional campaigns.\n\nThat\u2019s certainly true in the North Hills suburbs just outside Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where Emily Skopov, a former screenwriter for \u201cXena: Warrior Princess,\u201d has mounted a surprisingly competitive challenge against Pennsylvania House Speaker Mike Turzai.\n\n.@eskopov16, a former screen writer for Xena: Warrior Princess, is taking on Pa.

Turzai famously boasted in June 2012 that passage of the state\u2019s voter ID law would \u201callow\u201d Republican Mitt Romney to defeat then-President Barack Obama in Pennsylvania.\n\nUntil Skopov released an internal poll in October showing her within striking distance, though, she had trouble getting the official Democratic Party organs and labor unions in greater Pittsburgh to take her bid seriously.\n\n\ufeffWomen for the Future (WTF) Pittsburgh, a progressive PAC and field organizing outfit founded by, among other women, Allegheny County Controller Chelsa Wagner, was one of her earliest and most consistent champions. Two weeks ago, Skopov also got a boost from the Forward Majority super PAC, which purchased a 6-figure digital ad buy blasting Turzai for his coziness with lobbyists and corporations.", "Hero Images via Getty Images\n\nIt\u2019s a fact that if you\u2019re a human being living in 2018, you\u2019re likely to feel strung out at some point. A recent report by the American Psychological Association found that 69 percent of people surveyed said they feel stressed about the future of the country right now.\n\nFinding ways to alleviate that anxiety is key to taking care of yourself, both physically and mentally. One approach is to practice mindfulness \u2015 in other words, just take a few moments to be present and not think about anything \u2015 as a way to give your brain a reprieve.\n\nMany people shy away from mindfulness, either because it seems like a new age-y concept or because they simply don\u2019t feel like they have time to sit in silence for 10 minutes (or both, honestly). But here\u2019s the truth: It\u2019s not a ridiculous practice \u2015 research has shown time and time again that it works \u2015 and you don\u2019t need to dedicate 10 minutes to it to reap the benefits. Just 60 seconds can have a lasting impact.\n\nNeed proof that being more mindful can be accomplished in a short amount of time? We put it to the test as part of HuffPost\u2019s first-ever parenting conference, How To Raise A Kid. We partnered with SoulCycle to bring attendees a mindfulness break in between panel discussions that covered heavy, emotional topics like bullying and sex and consent.\n\nThe best part is you don\u2019t have to sit in a meditation room to do it yourself. All you need to do is close your eyes and pace your breathing. Take a look below at the SoulCycle mindfulness moment, part of our conference\u2019s livestream, to learn how to do it. (The instructions start at the 34-minute mark.) Then give it a try yourself the next time you find your blood boiling while reading a work email or you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed by the latest headlines:", "Fox News said Monday it has stopped airing the controversial political ad paid for by President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign, which likens members of the Central American migrant caravan to a man convicted of killing police officers in the U.S.\n\nThe Trump-friendly network\u2019s decision comes after CNN made headlines on Saturday for refusing to air it and after NBC came under fire for running it during prime time on Sunday night.\n\n\u201cUpon further review, Fox News pulled the ad yesterday and it will not appear on either Fox News Channel or Fox Business Network,\u201d ad sales president Marianne Gambelli said in a statement.\n\nIt is outrageous what the Democrats are doing to our Country.

Red hair is pretty rare \u2015 only around 2 percent of the world\u2019s population is born with it. In fact, Tyler was born with many of my traits. Everywhere I go, people tell me how much he looked like me.\n\nThere were many traits he was born with, like his hair color and his amazing gifts as a musician. Music was an inborn trait that just called to him from an early age. It was his passion and a deep part of who he was.\n\nThere were other traits that he was not born with, traits that I encouraged and helped to instill in him: doing well in school, being a caring brother and a thoughtful friend. I shared my faith with him by bringing him to church, hoping to instill in him the values that I believed in and surrounding him with a community that loved and cared for our family.\n\nTyler was the sum of all these parts and more, both his nature and his nurture. He was a vibrant, intelligent and talented young man. He died by suicide when he was 18, after he was viciously cyberbullied on his college campus. And what breaks my heart is that I believe Tyler was bullied because he was gay, another God-given trait he was born with. Who Tyler loved was as unchangeable as his bright, natural hair color, and another person used that to humiliate him and crush his spirit.\n\nI\u2019m a different person now than I was before my son died. Losing the child whose features I shared, whose hand I held, whose homework I checked and whose violin recitals I attended fundamentally changed the way I see the world.\n\nI understand bullying and the devastation it can cause differently as well. And as a mother who brought her son up in a Christian community and later lost him to suicide, I want to speak to every parent who wishes they could change a trait that was given to their child by God.\n\nI was again reminded of the important role organized religion can play in shaping how our children view themselves when I previewed an important film that opened this weekend called \u201cBoy Erased.\u201d Based on the memoir by Garrard Conley, the film tells the courageous story of the son of a Baptist pastor in a small American town who must overcome the fallout of being outed to his parents. His parents struggle to reconcile their love for their son with their beliefs. Fearing a loss of family, friends and community, the young man is pressured into attending a conversion therapy program.\n\nTelling your child or letting a religious leader tell your child that there is something wrong with them because of who they love is bullying. A church community that treats your child as being broken, less than or separated from God because they are gay or lesbian or bisexual, and insists that they must be fixed or repaired, is bullying. Sending your child to so-called reparative therapy is as damaging and traumatic as a beating from the schoolyard bully. None of it will change your child who is gay or lesbian.\n\nTo try and change what God has created causes significant harm. Reparative therapy can cause depression, anxiety, drug use, homelessness and suicidal ideation. It has been rejected by every mainstream medical and mental health organization as a dangerous and fraudulent practice that is traumatic and psychologically painful.\n\nIt is simply foolishness to continue to read Scripture with eyes of the first century. We must use all the knowledge and wisdom God continues to give to us today, in the 21st century. God has shown us through research that we cannot change a person\u2019s sexual orientation, just as we have learned that red hair and blue eyes are determined by your genes and are unchangeable.\n\nSince the day I lost my son, I\u2019ve changed the way I look at the teachings and traditions of the Christian church, and I now belong to a faith community that affirms all people just as God created them.\n\nI also recognized that above all else, Christians are called to love. We have been told that love is patient and kind. Love always protects, always trusts, always hopes. Love never fails us. Loving and embracing your gay, lesbian or bisexual child as God created them will never fail you. But reparative therapy will \u2015 it will fail you, and it will fail your children.\n\nJane Clementi is the co-founder of the Tyler Clementi Foundation. \u201cBoy Erased\u201d is open in select cities.

And I did tell anyone with ears.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t all that long ago that I would have had the same reaction. A longtime listener and first-time caller, I\u2019ve ugly cried on the streets of Brooklyn watching thousands of runners glide by in neon waves and questioned year after year why anyone would willingly put themselves through one mile of running, let alone 26.2.\n\nThen, about a year ago \u2015 Oct. 14, 2017 \u2015 I ran my first race, a half marathon. It was only eight weeks before then when I ran more than a mile for the first time. Ever.\n\nI spent the first 28 years of my life avoiding sports like the plague. I spent the last year and change not quite easing into long-distance running as much as going from 0 to 26.2 real quick. Take that, all those years at summer camp spent in the arts and crafts room.\n\nThe first question I\u2019m usually asked is how did I get to this point in long-distance running? And the truth is, I got here in a lot of different ways. Some I remember and some I don\u2019t. It didn\u2019t happen overnight, obviously, but it\u2019s not so easy to pinpoint the exact moment I felt like a \u201creal runner.\u201d\n\nI trained. A lot.\n\nI followed runner Hal Higdon\u2019s (free!) training program for both my half marathon and the marathon. It\u2019s a mix of mostly running, with some cross-training and some rest. I also cursed. A lot. Like a bad boyfriend, training for me is 95 percent low, with 5 percent extremely high. Running can feel impossible, unfulfilling and endless. But a runner\u2019s high is real, and it\u2019s fantastic.\n\nAnd like time spent with a bad boyfriend, I would forget every bad thing about a shitty training run the second it was over, then throw myself right back into the next one.\n\nTotally unlike a bad boyfriend, those hardest moments made me stronger, faster, more confident and more capable, both physically and mentally. The three miles that felt impossible one day felt a little less so the next. And so on, slowly but surely, mile by mile. I came up with mantras, stocked my playlist with almost 18 hours of music (you can find it here as long as you don\u2019t judge the songs on it!) and forced myself to just, well, do it. Sure, it\u2019s a cheesy slogan, but it became an integral part of my daily reminders. Just put on the clothes, get out there, you can always stop and walk, but just try.\n\nIf I\u2019m being honest ...\n\nI started running because I wanted to lose weight \u2015 despite many conflicting articles that debate running\u2019s effectiveness in weight loss and my own journey toward self-acceptance the way I am. And I did lose some weight, gain muscle \u2015 the whole shebang. But what running has done for my anxiety, my cluttered mind and my relationship with food has proved itself more important.\n\nLet me explain: I am a firm believer that you don\u2019t need to \u201cearn\u201d an indulgent food with exercise, and often get on a soapbox about eating that goddamn cheeseburger, regardless of whether you made it to your workout class that day. And I\u2019m often times full of shit. I give myself grief about every piece of food that goes into my body and feel leaps and bounds more comfortable \u201ctreating myself\u201d after a hard workout.\n\nThe hardest part of my 20-mile run day? Picking an ice cream afterward. (I picked both.)\n\nWhen you\u2019re running long distances, you have to eat a lot. You need the fuel. When I started looking at food as fuel to help get me over that hill, past that threshold, my mindset changed. It\u2019s not so much that I lost the \u201cearned it\u201d mentality as much as I just stopped giving food so much power to take over my thoughts. It is so. Incredibly. Refreshing.\n\nThere are a few things I learned along the way, some on my own and some with the help of a friend/stand-in running coach, that I\u2019d like to share with anyone interested in embarking on this journey.\n\nTraining for the NYC Marathon means starting in the summer, when it\u2019s hot, hazy and humid.\n\nIt\u2019s OK to miss some of those runs, and it\u2019s normal for those that you do to leave you totally defeated. Once the cooler temps hit, you will feel a lot better.\n\nNever not sweating through all my clothing.\n\nBut don\u2019t miss a run after Sept. 1. You\u2019ll feel a lot more ready mentally on race day if you go in knowing you\u2019ve done everything you can to prepare. And trust me, it\u2019s one big mind fuck.\n\nRunning really messes with your head.\n\nOne day you\u2019re cruising through 20 miles, the next day you\u2019re dragging through three. It\u2019s normal! Well, normal is relative, but it happens to everyone.\n\nBefore my first half marathon, I had so much anxiety about finishing, to prove to people that I could do it. After speaking with a sports psychologist who reminded me I wasn\u2019t running for spectators, my mindset changed. My mom was still parking the car when I got through the finish line of my first race, and I (mostly) didn\u2019t care.\n\nYou can do it. Believe me. The number of shocked friends and family members who have looked me in the face and said they quite frankly can\u2019t believe it\u2019s ME running a marathon has been vast. One of my friends cried when she told me how proud she was that I was doing it. Sure, we were three tequilas in at a wedding, but still.\n\nEmily McCombs I was so lucky to have the support of many friends and family members along the way, including HuffPost's own Emily McCombs and her son at mile five!\n\nIt gets more doable, but no less unpredictable. In September, I ran another half marathon, and I went into it feeling pretty cocky. I was training for the marathon, after all, so what\u2019s a measly 13.1? Except that I ate the wrong thing the night before, had to stop to use the bathroom almost every mile, and dealt with cramping pretty much the whole way. Remind me why I\u2019m doing this again?\n\nOh, because it\u2019s incredible.\n\nTwo weeks before the marathon, I finally took the advice of runners around me and joined a running group practicing the last 12 miles of the course. I was always afraid of running with people \u2015 I can barely breathe while I run, let alone have a conversation \u2015 and I worried about holding the group back. But runners are the most supportive people in the world. I spent most of the course chatting away, high five-ing other training groups and getting a feel for the strenuous end of the marathon route, something I was told many times is a must-do. The energy I felt from that day alone made me want to cry. Side note: Many running groups are free, and I highly recommend seeking them out.\n\nOri Demri Struggling at mile 23.\n\nThe experience is also so much bigger than you. I am proud to say I raised almost $4,000 for the American Cancer Society, and I ran alongside others who raised thousands for other charities.\n\nSo, even when I wanted to quit, when I was lost in Chinatown roaming the streets in search of Gatorade and unable to feel my legs, I kept going.\n\nA few other quick things: Every single Taylor Swift song has a perfect running tempo \u2015 trust me. You don\u2019t need to read every single piece of literature on the internet about running the marathon before you do it, but you will. Bring plenty of warm clothes you don\u2019t mind throwing out for the long, long wait in Staten Island. And, most importantly, ENJOY IT. Or try to, anyway.\n\nThe actual race day arrives.\n\nEnjoy it I did. Most of it. It\u2019s true that if you have your name on your shirt, you\u2019ll feel like a goddamn celebrity. I did for all six (yes, six) hours it took me to make my way through the five boroughs. Standing on the Verrazzano Bridge with 50,000 other people, the Manhattan skyline in the distance, is emotional. High-fiving kids on the sidelines is adorable. Seeing how genuinely happy people are to just cheer on random strangers is faith-restoring.\n\nWhen my legs started seizing up around mile 14 and never stopped, I thought for a long stretch that I wasn\u2019t going to make it and started questioning why I wanted to do this in the first place. But then I\u2019d see friends and family, who followed me all over this city like real champions \u2015 and my energy was renewed. My friend and running coach, who had an incredible drawing made for me, ran with me when I was on the brink of tears, rubbed muscle cream into my aching legs and reaffirmed that I could do it. I smiled the whole way, no matter how I was feeling. It helped.\n\nI burst into hysterics when I crossed the finish line. Partially because I couldn\u2019t walk, partially because I thought I would have been faster (I\u2019m trying to push that one away, but just being honest), and mostly because I never in a million years thought I would see this day.\n\nKristen Dwyer-O'Connor The END.\n\nMy immediate thought was that I would never put myself through something like that again. It was physically, mentally and emotionally the hardest day of my life.

Bernie Sanders campaigns with Democratic House candidate Randy Bryce in Wisconsin. Bryce is one of many Democrats campaigning on populist economic policies in districts won by Trump in 2016.\n\nThere has been a lot of argument about whether Democrats need to win by running more to the left or more to the center. In my writings, I\u2019ve contended that the best way for Democrats to gain ground is to run populist on economics.\n\nWhy? Because (1) that\u2019s where the country needs radical reform; (2) that\u2019s where the Clinton-Obama Democratic Party lost its soul; (3) if the election is all about identity, that plays to Trump\u2019s fear-mongering; and (4) economic populism creates a politics of working people of all races against economic royalists rather than working people of different backgrounds against each other.\n\nBy working people, I mean not just the \u201cworking class,\u201d often defined as the non-college-educated, but anyone who lives on paychecks and is not filthy rich. It\u2019s a class politics that Democrats can and should win. It\u2019s also a politics that can allow Democrats to win back some disgusted voters who voted for Trump because they didn\u2019t think either party spoke for their interests.\n\nTrump has tried to make the election about us versus them, with them defined as Muslims, African-Americans, and immigrants. But the real us versus them is everyone else versus Wall Street.\n\nThe people who insist that Democrats should not run on pocketbook issues because the economy has improved miss the point. The economy has barely made back its losses since the collapse of 2008. And the economy is vastly more precarious for regular people than it was a generation ago. That is the deeper source of Trumpism.\n\nIt\u2019s also a mistake to assume that Democrats should just forget about the white working class, who are mostly racist anyway, and focus on the \u201cemerging electorate\u201d \u2015 a new rainbow of African-Americans, Latinos, other immigrant groups, liberal professionals, the idealistic young, and LGBTQ people.\n\nThe white working class may be only 30 percent of the national electorate, but it\u2019s more than half the electorate in the states where Trump won the 2016 election \u2014 Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa and Indiana. In western Pennsylvania, the white working class is more than 60 percent.\n\nAnd it\u2019s a mistake because the next Democratic presidential candidate needs to win big, not just to eke out a victory based on a coalition of minorities. A Democratic Party that turned its back on a major portion of the working class would not be worthy of the name.\n\nAn opposite argument, advanced by groups that represent corporate Democrats, such as Third Way, holds that Democrats should not run as economic progressives because voters tend to self-identify as moderates rather than liberals. But if you dig deeper behind the superficial labeling, the majority of voters are in favor of defending and expanding Social Security and Medicare, and having a higher minimum wage. If that\u2019s the definition of moderate, bring it on.\n\nCongressional Quarterly via Getty Images Iowa Democrat JD Scholten has declared his support for Medicare for all and a number of other progressive economic positions during his run against Rep. Steve King.\n\nFor Democrats, the only way to win a real mandate would be to win back some of the working-class people who voted for Trump. Not all of them \u2014 winning back 15 or 20 percent of it would be huge. And the way to their hearts has to be through their pocketbooks.\n\nBut don\u2019t take my word for it. Take a close look at Tuesday\u2019s results, and see which winning Democratic candidates ran as economic progressives.\n\nThe Progressive Change Institute examined all 142 Democratic candidates in contested races, based on rankings from the nonpartisan Cook Political Report as well as material from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. The group then looked at which Democrats could reasonably be considered economic progressives, based on their support for such issues as Medicare for all or a Medicare public option and expanded Social Security.\n\nUsing these indicators, they found that in the 69 most competitive House races rated by the Cook Report as leaning Democratic, toss-ups, or leaning Republican (but winnable for the Democrat), 52 Democrats, or more than three-quarters, were running as economic progressives.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Democrat Jess King is running in Pennsylvania's 11th congressional district on a platform that includes expanding Social Security and Medicare and raising the minimum wage.\n\nOn Tuesday, we\u2019ll see how these progressive Democrats did. Even where the Democrat does not win, we can see how they performed relative to the Democrat in the same seat in 2016 or 2014, by using a clear progressive pocketbook message.\n\nThere are really two kinds of House races Tuesday. In some Republican-leaning suburban districts, where upscale voters are disgusted with Trump\u2019s vulgarity, his condoning of violence, his baiting of immigrants, not to mention his concentration camps for toddlers on the Mexican border, the Democrats are likely to pick up some seats regardless of whether they\u2019re running as moderates or as progressives. But in working-class seats that went for Trump last time, they are more likely to win as economic populists.\n\nOnce the midterm is behind us, and we start thinking seriously about the presidential election in 2020, this debate about whether Democrats should run as centrists or progressives will only intensify. Tuesday\u2019s results should inform that argument.", "Tap here to turn on desktop notifications to get the news sent straight to you.", "Demi Lovato is reportedly out of rehab, more than three months after she was hospitalized due to an apparent drug overdose.\n\nThe \u201cTell Me You Love Me\u201d singer was spotted out and about in Los Angeles over the weekend, dining with designer Henri Alexander Levy on Saturday night, according to TMZ.

On the night of her 16th birthday, Sabrina\u2019s aunts expect her to participate in a \u201cdark baptism,\u201d a ritual that would involve pledging her life to Satan. In exchange, she would become a full-fledged witch.\n\nBut Sabrina isn\u2019t interested in giving up her life as a mortal \u2015 or being forced to do Satan\u2019s bidding. She\u2019s intent on finding a third way forward, a path that lets her keep her mortal friends and boyfriend while maintaining her ties to the magical world. Her determination triggers a chaotic series of events, as forces of darkness and light battle for her soul.\n\nThe series may be billed as fantasy, but many people consider witchcraft a real and vital religious practice. Modern-day witches are incredibly diverse, coming from traditions such Wicca, Reclaiming and Hoodoo. Some witches see their craft as a way to connect with the sacred power of the earth. Others see witchcraft as a tool for the marginalized, a way for those on the fringes of society to exact justice that would otherwise be denied to them. Some witches practice magic to honor their ancestors, continuing ancient indigenous traditions that colonial powers sought for centuries to stamp out.\n\nHuffPost talked to several real-life witches about how Netflix\u2019s reboot portrays witches and witchcraft. Some praised the title character\u2019s gutsy efforts to stand up to the patriarchy. Other witches \u2015 particularly witches of color \u2015 thought the series reinforced old and harmful stereotypes about witchcraft and the people who practice it.\n\nElizabeth Ruth, a Haitian Vodou Priestess from Reynoldsburg, Ohio, initially was hopeful \u201cSabrina\u201d could \u201cmake a difference\u201d in how people perceived witches.

The West has used the idea that Black medicine doctors, conjurers and witches were \u201csatanic savages\u201d to steal humans, steal their lands, and forcefully convert them from their religions in an attempt to \u201cchristianize\u201d them.\n\nThe \u201clord\u201d of witches is not \u201cSatan.\u201d Most African Traditional Religion practitioners, Wiccans and pagans have no concept of \u201cthe devil\u201d in their spiritual traditions at all. So to bring up the whole \u201cwitchcraft equals Satan\u201d thing does not do any good for the already dreadful narratives surrounding witchcraft in American society \u2015 especially for Black people and Natives, who have been beaten, called \u201csatanists,\u201d maimed and hung more than anyone else for practicing our traditional African religions on this soil.\n\nI want people who watch the show to remember that practicing a non-Christian faith does not include signing your soul over to the devil, because 99 percent of the time, your non-Christian indigenous traditional faith predates the existence of the devil. Also, burning culturally appropriated sage and hoarding crystals mined from Congo to impress friends doesn\u2019t make anyone any more of a witch than a consumer. For [black, indigenous people of color], returning to our ancestral religious traditions is where the real power lies.\n\nLauren Stanko\n\nLong Beach, California\n\nGreen Witch, Wiccan\n\nI did watch \u201cSabrina The Teenage Witch\u201d growing up and remember the show portraying the struggles of a young woman with gifts in a light-hearted matter. The current rendition seems to have taken on darker undertones and is really about the war against the patriarchy.\n\nThe patriarchy attempted to vanquish us many moons ago and the witches of the world are being awakened to bring hope, peace and a sense of strength to the people of the world who may have forgotten that good is everywhere and evil doesn\u2019t have to win.\n\nShows like \u201cSabrina\u201d do not paint a real-life portrayal of Wiccanism or other pagan-based spiritual practices. I have never met a witch who praised Satan or studied demons. While I am sure that they exist, as with anything, there is always a light and a dark path available to you.\n\nCharley Gallay via Getty Images Kiernan Shipka at a premiere event for \"The Chilling Adventures Of Sabrina\" on Oct. 19.\n\nCourtney Brooke\n\nDanvers, Massachusetts\n\nWitch\n\nSo far the resounding voice I have heard in response to this show has been positive, especially about how the LGBTQ community is represented. I haven\u2019t finished the show yet, but so far I really enjoy how femme-positive it is. My biggest gripe with the \u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d coven was that the witches in that show were pitted against each other without a sense of community. So far in \u201cSabrina,\u201d it seems to be more of her being pinned between patriarchal factions and having the support of women in her life navigate that.\n\nI want people who watch the show to remember that we certainly are not all satanists! More often than not, we are people who find nature, equal rights and lifting others up to create a better world for everyone far more interesting than Satan.

Spreading tales of Satan-worshipping, sexually depraved, homicidal witches was one way the Church, and European society at large, maintained dominance over women.\n\nOne of the biggest messages of \u201cChilling Adventures\u201d is that patriarchal supremacy is insidious and it is everywhere. Even the witchly Church of Night is controlled by oppressive male figures. And one of the things I love best about the show is that Sabrina is trying to combat this and find her own, self-directed way of doing magic. And that is actually one of the truest reflections of the practice of witchcraft that I\u2019ve seen on television.\n\nWitches have always been political figures, because they represent a marginalized \u201cother\u201d who is seen as a threat to the status quo. Throughout most of history \u2015 and still today in many parts of the world \u2015 when someone calls someone else a witch, it is usually meant as a negative epithet, and it is more often than not used against women. Things are starting to change, however, and over the last 150 years or so we\u2019ve seen the witch be reclaimed and reframed as a symbol of feminism, freedom and autonomy. And this is directly related to our evolving ideas about women and their worth: As we\u2019ve begun to value women more, we\u2019ve begun to value witches.\n\nThese responses have been edited for clarity and length.", "Middleton School District superintendent Dr. Josh Middleton announced during a Saturday morning school board meeting that 14 employees of the school district\u2019s Heights Elementary school were put on paid administrative leave following the controversial costumes.

Like so many other immigrants, they built a life in Delano, a city of 53,000 that\u2019s about 140 miles north of Los Angeles. There, they worked in the world\u2019s most productive farm industry, in its vast sea of grape vines, fruit trees and multi-seasonal crops. But early that March morning, as the Garcias drove through town, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents closed in on their SUV.\n\nAttempting to evade agents, the undocumented couple sped down a country road. The vehicle went out of control and crashed into a pole and rolled over, killing the Garcias, who never knew that ICE was looking for Santos\u2019 brother, not for them.\n\nThe Garcias\u2019 deaths left their six children, who are not all U.S. citizens, orphaned. And in Delano\u2014where in 1965 the United Farm Workers first carved their place in history\u2014anger and fear about what happened has added urgency and upped the stakes for the midterm election occurring Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThis has been huge wake-up call for the Latino community,\u201d said Yazmin Hernandez, 22, a graduate of Fresno State University who helps legal permanent-resident immigrants in Delano apply for citizenship. \u201cAs a child of farmworkers,\u201d she said, \u201cI really want to vote.\u201d\n\nBut do others agree? Hernandez and a lot of young Latinos like her \u2014 many motivated, some less so \u2014 could be pivotal to what happens in this grape-growing region with a disappointing history of voter turnout. That history explains why get-out-the-vote campaigns hoping to energize thousands of voters have been sweeping through California\u2019s Central Valley in recent weeks, as labor groups and immigrant rights activists aim to send a message to President Donald J. Trump.\n\nIn the eye of the storm: the district\u2019s congressman, U.S. Rep. David Valadao, a Republican who has defied the odds by being elected three times in a district where Democrats hold a registration advantage and Hillary Clinton was victorious just two years ago.\n\nYouth get involved\n\nThere\u2019s no escaping Delano\u2019s dramatic past. Not far from the roadside shrine commemorating the Garcias, the United Farm Workers\u2019 original adobe headquarters, \u201cForty Acres,\u201d is now a national historic landmark \u2014 something few would have imagined in the late 1960s here in Kern County. A bronze plaque and other markers explain Delano\u2019s place in a chapter of American history that still rankles some conservatives and divides people here even today.\n\nSusan Ferriss / Center for Public Integrity Delano is home to Forty Acres, now a national historic landmark. It\u2019s where Cesar Chavez and farmworkers established a headquarters in the late 1960s to fight for farm labor and civil rights. Chavez fasted in a room at Forty Acres, pictured at left, to demand rights for agricultural workers.\n\nIt took a five-year strike and a national boycott campaign for the UFW to obtain its first union contract in 1970 benefiting Mexican-American and Mexican and Filipino immigrant grape laborers. As door-to-door voter turnout campaigns tick up to Election Day, Forty Acres is a reminder that change can take root slowly.\n\nFor frustrated Democrats, this is a crucial beachhead. Out of the 53 seats allotted to California in the House of Representatives, only 14 districts are held by Republicans in a state that\u2019s been gradually turning deep blue for years now. Delano, 77 percent Latino, sits in one of the GOP pockets: the sprawling 21st Congressional District. The Almanac of American Politics says Valadao has won here against Democratic candidates \u201cwho have consistently under-performed initial expectations.\u201d\n\nStretching more than 150-miles northwest to southeast, the Valley district includes parts of Fresno, Kings, Tulare and Kern counties and a piece of the city of Bakersfield. The district is also home to a smattering of small cities, Naval Air Station Lemoore, a major fighter base, and mile after mile of crops and dairy farms.\n\nInterest in midterm elections is usually tepid compared to presidential races. But it\u2019s the age of Trump, and California is a state where Latinos, mostly Mexican-American, are now the single largest demographic.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Democrats hope that more door-to-door contact with \u201clow-propensity\u201d voters and \u201cticket splitters\u201d will channel that anti-Trump sentiment into victories in at least a few GOP-held districts. If that happens, GOP California could shrink more and contribute to \u201cflipping\u201d the Republican-held U.S. House of Representatives to Democrats. But Valadao has not been alone in bucking the tide; neighboring conservative districts are held by House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and rising conservative star Devin Nunes.\n\nDemocrats would dearly love to do better here. But even enthusiasts don\u2019t expect turnout miracles.\n\nStatewide, Latinos are only 21 percent of those most likely to vote in elections generally, even though 34 percent of those eligible to vote in California are Latino, according to the Public Policy Institute of California.\n\nBut young people, especially, who are scared for their peers\u2019 or their own undocumented parents, say there\u2019s no choice but to hit the streets and persuade those eligible to cast ballots.\n\n\u201cWe share a history as the children of immigrant parents. We don\u2019t know if the next ICE pursuit with be for one our families,\u201d said Bryan Osorio, 22, who grew up in Delano. He explained the personal stakes for so many here during a meeting at Delano\u2019s sole Starbucks. The coffee shop wasn\u2019t far from where workers, swaddled in scarfs to fend off dust, were gleaning the last of this area\u2019s gargantuan crop of table grapes to ship back East.\n\nAfter the Garcias died, Delano police examined video and found that ICE agents had pursued the couple with lights flashing, contrary to what ICE agents told officers investigating circumstances of the chase. Police recommended Kern County prosecutors charge ICE agents for providing false information, but prosecutors disagreed that evidence supported that charge. Osorio and fellow students who were home on spring break marched with Delano high school students denouncing Trump\u2019s aggressive deployment of ICE.\n\nOsorio\u2019s immigrant parents aren\u2019t citizens and can\u2019t vote, he said. But he can.\n\nSusan Ferriss / Center for Public Integrity Bryan Osorio, 22, of Delano, talks to an 80-year-old Delano voter. Osorio is a University of California, Berkeley, graduate running for Delano City Council to address drinking water problems and defend immigrant families.\n\nGoing back years, Republican politicians and agribusiness companies in California have acknowledged that they depend on immigrant workers, many of whom likely don\u2019t have authentic work documents. As producers of more than half the fruits, vegetables and nuts in the country \u2014 and as the biggest dairy producers \u2014 California agribusiness interests lobbied Washington for years to legalize the labor force.\n\nThat didn\u2019t happen, and then Trump was elected.\n\nBecause he\u2019d like a leadership role in vigorously challenging Trump policies, Osorio is now running for Delano City Council. He\u2019s also vowing to address Delano\u2019s poor water quality and stop water rate hikes burdening low-income families here. Armed with research to help him home in on infrequent voters, the recent University of California at Berkeley graduate has been knocking on doors on the West side of Delano, the Latino barrio back when Latinos were a minority and some white-owned establishments barred Mexicans from entry. [FS4] [WG5]\n\nOther college students are backing Osorio, and they split up homes chosen as targets. When he\u2019s not campaigning, Osorio\u2019s working as a fellow at the American Civil Liberties Institute.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve gotten a lot of vulgar comments from older men,\u201d Osorio said of reactions to his campaign. \u201cThey said, \u2018When I was your age I was chasing girls and partying. But my respect to you.\u2019 \u201d\n\nDuring his canvassing rounds, Osorio secured a verbal pledge of support from an 80-year-old citizen relaxing in his rose garden. A younger man in dusty work clothes shook Osorio\u2019s hand and assured him in a mix of Spanish and English that he\u2019d already voted \u201call Democrats\u201d and for Osorio.\n\n\u201cMaybe he did,\u201d Osorio said, as his team discussed follow up visits. Not all voters appreciated the students\u2019 visits. As one of Osorio\u2019s friends approached a house, he was met with: \u201cI don\u2019t vote. Go away.\u201d\n\nSplit-ticket voters\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see why it\u2019s frustrating to Delano immigrant activists and Democrats that the 21st Congressional District remains Republican.\n\nThe sunbaked valley has some of the worst air pollution in the country and high rates of health problems like diabetes and asthma. Obamacare was a boon to many low-income residents here.\n\nThe district chose Democrat Hillary Clinton over Trump by about 16 points in 2016, making it one of seven GOP-held congressional districts in the state where the Democrat prevailed. But even with an estimated 16-point Democratic registration advantage over Republicans in the 21st District, voters also returned Valadao to Congress.\n\nLike the more nationally recognizable Nunes, Valadao, 41, comes from dairy-farming roots. A bank seized Valadao\u2019s family farm in June due to $8 million in unpaid loans, a crisis Valadao said exemplifies the travails of farmers he serves.\n\nA mild-mannered man, Valadao recently posed in Arizona with President Trump, along with Nunes and McCarthy of Bakersfield, who hopes to vault from GOP majority leader to Speaker of the House if the GOP retains control.\n\nThe photo op on Oct. 19 was all about irrigation water \u2014 a massive issue here. It showcased Trump signing a memo accelerating biological reviews of water systems that Central Valley farmers \u2014 and workers \u2014 hope will divert more water from California rivers that are home to endangered species. Trump\u2019s move was met here with strong approval, and there was Valadao by his side.\n\nIn addition to its tight bond with agribusiness, the Valley is also one of California\u2019s most culturally conservative regions. Evangelical churches are prominent, along with conservative talk radio. Some local Latino activists suggest,too, that Valadao has benefited at the polls because some voters think he is of Mexican heritage. In reality, Valadao is of Portuguese descent, as is Nunes.\n\nSo, what gives Democrats hope for this election?\n\nThe president\u2019s lacerating rhetoric about Mexican immigrants has upset a lot of people, so even if they regard Valadao as moderate, Trump has further tarnished the Republican brand in California. About 62 percent of the 21st District\u2019s residents who are eligible to vote are Latino.\n\n\u201cThese immigrants risk their lives to work here,\u201d said Mexican-American Erica Cruz, 48, a self-employed hairdresser whose husband used to be undocumented. \u201cLatinos are getting picked on. This town thrives on Latinos. \u2026 Trump is putting us in a terrible position, and we\u2019re scared.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s irksome to Cruz because it\u2019s plain to her that the region\u2019s agribusiness industry \u2014 America\u2019s farm powerhouse \u2014 has benefited from people who shoulder all the risks that come with undocumented immigration. Workers have assumed the burden of paying smugglers thousands of dollars to get them over the border, so they can take back-breaking jobs they obtain by showing fake documents that employers have no obligation to authenticate.\n\nToday, it\u2019s common for there to be no bright line between documented and undocumented in towns like Delano because there are many \u201cmixed status\u201d families, with some members citizens, others legal residents and still others who are undocumented, \u201csin papales,\u201d without papers.\n\nSusan Ferriss / Center for Public Integrity Immigrant workers are the backbone of agribusiness in California\u2019s 21st Congressional District and other GOP-held districts in the Central Valley.\n\nValadao, whose campaign did not respond to interview requests, has succeeded in part because he\u2019s sensitive to the composition of his district, and he\u2019s tried to walk a difficult line on immigration.\n\nOn his Spanish-language website, he calls himself an \u201chijo de inmigrantes,\u201d a son of immigrants.\n\nValadao\u2019s website also says he supports a path to legal status for undocumented people: \u201cThis will allow mills of immigrants to come out of the shadows \u2026 and raise their families without the constant fear of deportation.\u201d But none of Valadao\u2019s positions have gone anywhere under GOP leadership.\n\nWhen pressed on immigration, Valadao has pointed out that he signed a petition this year designed to force GOP House leaders to allow lawmakers to vote on a series of complex immigration proposals, among them a path to legal status for Dreamers, undocumented people brought to the United States as children.\n\nThe petition failed to lead to any reforms passing.\n\nIn Delano, voters seemed either unaware of the byzantine petition process or dismissed it as window dressing to aid GOP legislators looking for Latino votes.\n\nTJ Cox, Valadao\u2019s Democratic rival, told Valadao during a recent debate: \u201cThe fact is your party has control of every branch of government \u2026 and you can\u2019t pass \u2026 an immigration bill.\u201d\n\nCox, 55, is a Fresno engineer and businessman who\u2019s developed dams \u2014 he can talk water \u2014 and who\u2019s also founded two nut-processing businesses and a series of health centers in lower-income areas. He\u2019s part Chinese and Filipino, which he\u2019s highlighted in this multicultural region.\n\nBut Valadao has attacked Cox for living a few miles outside the 21st District \u2014 which is allowed \u2014 and for what Cox says was an \u201chonest mistake\u201d in claiming his Fresno home and an East Coast home as his primary address while his wife was studying in Maryland.\n\nThe influential Cook Political Report predicts a win for Valadao. It\u2019s moved the 21st District race to \u201clikely Republican,\u201d rather than the more equivocal \u201clean\u201d or \u201ctoss up\u201d designations given to some of California\u2019s other contested districts.\n\nCox\u2019s campaign, though, sees hope in fresh numbers pollsters might not be capturing.\n\nSince Trump took office in January 2017, campaign workers point out, more than 30,000 additional people have registered to vote in the 21st District, more than 20,000 of them Latinos.\n\n\u201cLatinos know there\u2019s some guy there in the administration that has no respect for them,\u201d Cox told the Center for Public Integrity after his wife, Kathleen Murphy, a pediatric intensive care physician, passed her cell phone over for a chat. On a recent weekend, she was in a Delano park with supporters who fanned out through town as part of a Democratic \u201cblue wave\u201d door-to-door strategy to try to coax voters to come out.\n\nJoining Murphy was Cruz, the Delano hairdresser, who said that rather than just casting a ballot this year, she felt compelled to hold home meetings and to canvass along with other bilingual volunteers. She\u2019s hoping Republican hostility to the Affordable Care Act \u2014 and Valadao\u2019s votes to oppose and then repeal it \u2014 will also animate voters to choose Cox.\n\nBut, she conceded, many people aren\u2019t aware of Valadao\u2019s votes and she\u2019s left explaining them.\n\n\u201cWe must fight back,\u201d she said.\n\nVeronica Lopez, 36, a medical technician, is just the type of voter Cruz wants to reach.\n\nIn an interview at Starbucks, where she was scrolling through her phone, Lopez said that she had voted for Hillary Clinton. She has health insurance through her job. What\u2019s weighing on her mind these days is college affordability, which has stymied her son\u2019s plans for a four-year college.\n\nShe does care about immigration to the extent that she doesn\u2019t want to see families \u201ctorn apart.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like people deported for no good reason,\u201d she said. Farms have been losing workers because of ICE enforcement and they need workers, she added.\n\nAnd as for Trump, she said with a shake of her head, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a president who talks so badly about people.\u201d Will she vote? She thinks so but wasn\u2019t certain. She didn\u2019t seem that excited about the kinds of races on the ballot this time around.\n\nPolitical scientist Mark Martinez at California State University at Bakersfield, also in Kern County, said he thinks if TJ Cox were running in a presidential election year, his odds of defeating Valadao would be far greater.\n\nA longtime observer of elections here, Martinez said it\u2019s \u201cPoli Sci 101\u201d why more Central Valley voters don\u2019t come out more at midterms: Just as in other parts of the country, he said, the least advantaged people are the least likely to believe their vote matters.\n\n\u201cWe have some of the poorest congressional districts,\u201d he said. Valadao, he added, doesn\u2019t make \u201cany stupid mistakes\u201d with regard to the hot-button issue of immigration.\n\nSowing voter seeds\n\nAnother Delano resident, Valerie Gorospe, 40, is a community organizer at Delano\u2019s Center on Race, Poverty and the Environment. She collaborated with a bipartisan voter-registration education campaign this past year called Central Valley Freedom Summer.\n\nThe campaign sent college students from the University of California\u2019s Santa Cruz and Merced campuses back to their Valley hometowns to talk to kids about voting, and register 18-year-olds along with kids 16 and older, who can pre-register in California.\n\nGorospe grew up in an Earlimart, right across from a giant vineyard in the 21st Congressional District.\n\nGorospe said she can\u2019t understand how agribusiness can continue to vote for politicians who support Trump, who\u2019s portrayed undocumented people as criminals and has pushed for blanket deportation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like cutting your arms off,\u201d Gorospe said of Trump-supporting politicians whose districts have so eagerly used immigrant laborers.\n\nSusan Ferriss/Center for Public Integrity Valerie Gorospe, 40, a Delano community organizer, said more young voters are connecting federal policy under Trump with their families\u2019 lives.\n\nThe Kern County Farm Bureau didn\u2019t respond to a request to talk about Trump, ICE enforcement and the election. The group\u2019s Facebook page has multiple posts about labor shortage concerns and educational sessions on how to respond to audits of employment records ICE carries out to identify potential undocumented employees.\n\nLocal chambers of commerce and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have endorsed Valadao, because of his connections to \u201cag, energy and water,\u201d as a press release said.\n\nGorospe said she thinks Trump and GOP positions on immigration are going to bring more younger voters to the polls next week.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen curiosity about voting in this age group like I\u2019ve seen this year,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019ve really connected federal policies with what\u2019s happening here.\u201d\n\nOthers are trying to share that optimism. Veronica Terriquez, who is a UC Santa Cruz associate professor of sociology, organized the Freedom Summer project. Research, she said, shows that kids are often \u201csocialized\u201d to vote and learn about candidates and issues within their family. The project is trying to address the absence of that socialization in Central Valley homes because so many kids\u2019 parents aren\u2019t citizens and either can\u2019t vote or vote infrequently.\n\nSchools, too, Terriquez said, don\u2019t devote a lot of time encouraging voting. She said some Central Valley school administrators, worried about controversy, were initially hesitant to allow returning college students to talk with younger kids and conduct registration.\n\n\u201cOne of the high school students asked if there were concerns if she, a citizen, registered, and her parents were undocumented,\u201d Terriquez added.\n\nDuring the 2014 midterms, turnout among all Californians eligible to vote was a record low of about 31 percent. But for eligible 18- to 24-year-olds, turnout was even worse at about 8 percent. Turnout for the young demographic in the Central Valley was even lower at less than 7 percent, according to research by the California Civic Engagement Project at the University of Southern California\u2019s Sacramento office.\n\nMindy Romero, director of the California Civic Engagement Project, said that beyond registration, cultivating turnout \u201ctakes deep, multiple contacts,\u201d along with strategies that include \u201cpeer to peer\u201d outreach and time spent in communities off the election cycle.\n\nThat\u2019s what one nonpartisan group, Faith in the Valley, has been trying to do in five counties, including Kern, where Delano is.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re shooting to speak to between 12,000 and 15,000 voters,\u201d said Carmen Medrano, a regional organizer for the Valley group. \u201cWe\u2019re not from a political party, we say. We\u2019re here about issues, like affordable housing, fair rents, making sure immigrant families are protected.\u201d\n\nThe United Farm Workers are also active in the district, though they\u2019re focused more on a state Assembly race. On their rounds, canvassers explain the union\u2019s slate choices, which include Valadao\u2019s opponent, TJ Cox. UFW member Nancy Oropeza, who\u2019s working on the effort, said that canvassers have also left potted flowers with voters to remind them \u2014 when you water the flower, think about voting.\n\nThe UFW assignment was to reach a universe in multiple towns of 16,000, face-to-face, who are Latino and infrequent voters.\n\n\u201cThe first thing we\u2019ve been hearing from people we contact is: Trump, Trump. He attacks us,\u201d Oropeza said. \u201cOnce they say, yes, they want to vote, you go back to ensure they\u2019ve received their ballot.\u201d\n\nOver at Delano\u2019s Our Lady of Guadalupe Church, another influential institution in town \u2014 which has collaborated with the UFW to aid the orphaned Garcia children \u2014 Father Miguel Campos said the church doesn\u2019t favor candidates in elections. But the church does believe that elections matter.", "Tap here to turn on desktop notifications to get the news sent straight to you.", "A young queer woman\u2019s journey to authenticity begins with a madcap Thanksgiving feast in \u201cLez Bomb,\u201d Jenna Laurenzo\u2019s smart and sentimental debut feature.\n\nThe movie, due out Friday, is an homage to comedies like \u201cHome for the Holidays\u201d and \u201cThe Family Stone,\u201d but with an inclusive, forward-thinking twist. It follows Lauren (played by Laurenzo), a 20-something Brooklynite happily in the throes of a newish relationship with her girlfriend Hailey (Caitlin Mehner). On the night before Thanksgiving, Lauren plans a visit to her suburban New Jersey hometown to introduce Hailey to her family and come out as a lesbian at the same time.\n\nCatch a \u201cLez Bomb\u201d sneak peak in the clip above, exclusively on HuffPost.\n\nHer big reveal, however, is thwarted by her culinary-challenged parents, a pot-smoking uncle and a randy brother who won\u2019t stop hitting on her girlfriend.

She told HuffPost her goal was to create a feature-length follow-up to her viral 2015 short, \u201cGirl Night Stand,\u201d which featured a woman questioning her sexuality after hooking up with another woman for the first time.\n\nShe also wanted \u201cLez Bomb\u201d to break away from other queer-centric films as a feel-good, all-ages comedy that would feel like a holiday classic. \u201cI wanted to lean into the nostalgia of the family films that I grew up loving,\u201d she said. \u201cI was hoping I could make a film that I could comfortably play in my family room on Thanksgiving with my grandparents, where we\u2019d all be laughing together.\u201d\n\nBefore long, Laurenzo had assembled a starry cast that included Bruce Dern, Steve Guttenberg and Cloris Leachman. Bobby Farrelly, whose credits include \u201cThere\u2019s Something About Mary,\u201d signed on to executive produce the film, most of which was shot at Laurenzo\u2019s childhood home and a motel that\u2019s been operated by her family since the 1950s.\n\nMuch like \u201cNational Lampoon\u2019s Christmas Vacation\u201d and \u201cA Christmas Story,\u201d \u201cLez Bomb\u201d often resorts to over-the-top hijinks for laughs.

She also wisely keeps viewers invested in Lauren and Hailey\u2019s relationship; as Lauren\u2019s loved ones reveal their flaws (albeit in humorous ways), her concerns about introducing her girlfriend into such a whirlwind of relatable dysfunction feel legitimate.\n\nThough \u201cLez Bomb\u201d occasionally drifts into absurdity, the movie is a pleasant and entertaining introduction to Laurenzo as a cinematic storyteller for the post-\u201cLove, Simon\u201d era.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci)\n\nBy STEVE PEOPLES, Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The day of reckoning for American politics has nearly arrived.\n\nVoters on Tuesday will decide the $5 billion debate between President Donald Trump\u2019s take-no-prisoner politics and the Democratic Party\u2019s super-charged campaign to end the GOP\u2019s monopoly in Washington and statehouses across the nation.\n\nThere are indications that an oft-discussed \u201cblue wave\u201d may help Democrats seize control of at least one chamber of Congress. But two years after an election that proved polls and prognosticators wrong, nothing is certain on the eve of the first nationwide elections of the Trump presidency.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a Democrat in this country that doesn\u2019t have a little angst left over from 2016 deep down,\u201d said Stephanie Schriock, president of EMILY\u2019s List, which spent more than ever before \u2014 nearly $60 million in all \u2014 to support Democratic women this campaign season.\n\n\u201cEverything matters and everything\u2019s at stake,\u201d Schriock said.\n\nAll 435 seats in the U.S. House are up for re-election. And 35 Senate seats are in play, as are almost 40 governorships and the balance of power in virtually every state legislature.\n\nWhile he is not on the ballot, Trump himself has acknowledged that the 2018 midterms, above all, represent a referendum on his presidency.\n\nShould Democrats win control of the House, as strategists in both parties suggest is likely, they could derail Trump\u2019s legislative agenda for the next two years. Perhaps more importantly, they would also win subpoena power to investigate the president\u2019s many personal and professional missteps.\n\nTuesday\u2019s elections will also test the strength of a Trump-era political realignment defined by evolving divisions among voters by race, gender and especially education.\n\nTrump\u2019s Republican coalition is increasingly becoming older, whiter, more male and less likely to have a college degree. Democrats are relying more upon women, people of color, young people and college graduates.\n\nThe political realignment, if there is one, could re-shape U.S. politics for a generation.\n\nJust five years ago, the Republican National Committee reported that the GOP\u2019s very survival depended upon attracting more minorities and women. Those voters have increasingly fled Trump\u2019s Republican Party, turned off by his chaotic leadership style and xenophobic rhetoric. Blue-collar men, however, have embraced the unconventional president.\n\nOne of the RNC report\u2019s authors, Ari Fleischer, acknowledged that Republican leaders never envisioned expanding their ranks with white, working-class men.\n\n\u201cWhat it means to be Republican is being rewritten as we speak,\u201d Fleischer said. \u201cDonald Trump has the pen, and his handwriting isn\u2019t always very good.\u201d\n\nA nationwide poll released Sunday by NBC News and The Wall Street Journal details the depth of the demographic shifts.\n\nDemocrats led with likely African-American voters (84 percent to 8 percent), Latinos (57 percent to 29 percent), voters between the ages of 18-34 (57 percent to 34 percent), women (55 percent to 37 percent) and independents (35 percent to 23 percent).\n\nAmong white college-educated women, Democrats enjoy a 28-point advantage: 61 percent to 33 percent.\n\nOn the other side, Republicans led with voters between the ages of 50 and 64 (52 percent to 43 percent), men (50 percent to 43 percent) and whites (50 percent to 44 percent). And among white men without college degrees, Republicans led 65 percent to 30 percent.\n\nDemocrats hope to elect a record number of women to Congress. They are also poised to make history with the number of LGBT candidates and Muslims up and down the ballot.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama seized on the differences between the parties in a final-days scramble to motivate voters across the nation.\n\n\u201cOne election won\u2019t eliminate racism, sexism or homophobia,\u201d Obama said during an appearance in Florida. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen in one election. But it\u2019ll be a start.\u201d\n\nmpi10/MediaPunch/IPx Former President Barack Obama speaks during a rally to support Florida Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum and U.S. Senator Bill Nelson (D-FL) at the Ice Palace film studios on November 02, 2018 in Miami, Florida. (Credit: MPI10 / MediaPunch /IPX)\n\nTrump has delivered a very different closing argument, railing against Latin American immigrants seeking asylum at the U.S. border.\n\nWith the walking caravan weeks away, Trump dispatched more than 5,000 troops to the region. The president also said soldiers would use lethal force against migrants who throw rocks, before later reversing himself.\n\nStill, his xenophobic rhetoric has been unprecedented for an American president in the modern era: \u201cBarbed wire used properly can be a beautiful sight,\u201d Trump told voters in Montana.\n\nThe hyper-charged environment is expected to drive record turnout in some places, but on the eve of the election, it\u2019s far from certain which side will show up in the greatest numbers.\n\nThe outcome is clouded by the dramatically different landscape between the House and Senate.\n\nDemocrats are most optimistic about the House, a sprawling battlefield extending from Alaska to Florida. Most top races, however, are set in America\u2019s suburbs where more educated and affluent voters in both parties have soured on Trump\u2019s turbulent presidency, despite the strength of the national economy.\n\nDemocrats need to pick up two dozen seats to claim the House majority.\n\nBillionaire former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who personally invested $110 million to help Democrats this year, largely in the House, has seized on voter education levels in picking target races, according to senior aide Howard Wolfson.\n\n\u201cIn this cycle, it seemed as if there was a disproportionately negative reaction among highly educated voters to Trump,\u201d he said.\n\nAs a result, Bloomberg\u2019s team poured money into otherwise overlooked suburban districts in states like Georgia, Washington state and Oklahoma because data revealed voters there were better-educated.\n\nDemocrats face a far more difficult challenge in the Senate, where they are almost exclusively on defense in rural states where Trump remains popular. Democratic Senate incumbents are up for re-election, for example, in North Dakota, West Virginia, and Montana \u2014 states Trump carried by 30 percentage points on average two years ago.\n\nDemocrats need to win two seats to claim the Senate majority, although most political operatives in both parties expect Republicans to add to their majority.\n\nWhile Trump is prepared to claim victory if his party retains Senate control, at least one prominent ally fears that losing even one chamber of Congress could be disastrous.\n\n\u201cIf they take back the House, he essentially will become a lame-duck president, and he won\u2019t win re-election,\u201d said Amy Kremer, a tea party activist who leads the group Women for Trump.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll do anything and everything they can to impeach him,\u201d she said.\n\nIndeed, powerful Democratic forces are already pushing for Trump\u2019s impeachment, even if Democratic leaders aren\u2019t ready to go that far.\n\nLiberal activist Tom Steyer spent roughly $120 million this midterm season. Much of that has gone to boost turnout among younger voters, although he has produced a nationwide advertising campaign calling for Trump\u2019s impeachment.\n\nSteyer insisted that most Democrats agree.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not some fringe element of the Democratic Party. We are the Democratic Party,\u201d he said.\n\nBy Election Day, both sides are expected to have spent more than $5 billion, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. The flood of campaign cash, a midterm record, has been overwhelmingly fueled by energy on the left.\n\nMoney aside, Steyer said he and concerned voters everywhere have invested their hearts and souls into the fight to punish Trump\u2019s party.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s at stake: my heart and soul, along with everybody else\u2019s,\u201d he said.\n\n___", "This might be his most controversial endorsement of all.\n\nKanye West declared on Twitter Sunday that his favorite restaurant is McDonald\u2019s.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s is my favorite restaurant \u2014 ye (@kanyewest) November 4, 2018\n\nSure, his ardent support of fast-food loving President Donald Trump has raised eyebrows, as has his bizarre White House appearance and a few of his remarks of late.

Except for half an hour every night, my phone was locked away. When I did use it, counselors monitored me closely, making sure that I wasn\u2019t on Snapchat, using the reverse-facing camera or zooming in on photos of my face.\n\nI was at McLean Hospital\u2019s OCD Institute in Massachusetts. I\u2019d had body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) for three years and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) for 15. I was preoccupied with an indentation on my face caused by a cortisone shot intended to treat an acne cyst. I couldn\u2019t go more than 15 minutes without checking my reflection \u2014 without, in BDD/OCD terms, ritualizing.\n\nI was familiar with rituals. In seventh grade, I developed harm obsessions (I feared I would stab my mother) and sexual ones (I feared I would molest my classmates). I had no idea that OCD could have anything to do with these thoughts. I was terrified that I would be sent to prison, that I would be \u201cfound out\u201d and locked up. I began kneeling in prayer throughout the day, asking God to banish the thoughts. Then the praying became just kneeling. Then the kneeling became a quick bend, a quick touch to the ground. I knelt so often that I have to wear a brace now when I exercise.\n\nThe harm obsessions disappeared, and another arrived. I was 17 and started noticing clear shapes and dark spots in my vision. I knew at once what they were: eye floaters. It occurred to me that I might go blind, that I might never be able to read again. I started spending all my time indoors. I read in my dim closet and ventured outside at dusk.\n\nEventually, I began exposure therapy. In exposure therapy, patients with OCD are exposed to a feared stimulus \u2014 a trigger \u2014 for a period. Once you understand that you will not die because you go on a plane/hold a knife/get a shot, you can perform the action again. Eventually, the anxiety surrounding the stimulus disappears.\n\nI feared bright lighting, which made the floaters worse. So I stood outside and read \u201cThe Hunger Games\u201d to my new therapist, who had confiscated my dark sunglasses. Eight years later, I can walk and read and drive in direct sunlight. So I had a lot of faith in exposure therapy.\n\nMy therapists at McLean told me over and over that I wasn\u2019t at the hospital to change my thoughts. You can only change your actions, we were told.\n\nBy the beginning of 2018, I was in an MFA program for fiction writing and had been on one selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or another for eight years. I also spent every second of my waking life thinking about my appearance. I simply could not stop obsessing.\n\nEven when I was talking or reading or cooking, an uneasy feeling floated beneath my thoughts. Sometimes it took me a moment to remember what it concerned. Oh, right. The dent. But the feeling was always there. The anxiety never lifted.\n\nI spent hours in front of different reflective surfaces each day. I sent my friends pictures of my face and asked for their feedback. I compared pre-dent photos with post-dent photos. I approached strangers and asked them to examine my cheek. Don\u2019t you see it? Don\u2019t you see it? If they didn\u2019t, I felt angry and betrayed; I was certain they were lying. If they nodded and said yes, I plunged into a bad mood from which it took days to emerge.\n\nThat summer, I was going to work as a teaching assistant at my old beloved summer camp. And then I realized I couldn\u2019t do it. I couldn\u2019t spend one more day pretending to live a normal life. I had to recover from BDD first.\n\nThe fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders classifies BDD as an OC-spectrum disorder. According to the International OCD Foundation, sufferers must meet several criteria to receive a diagnosis of BDD: an excessive preoccupation with appearance, repetitive behaviors (such as checking and camouflaging, like compulsively applying makeup), clinical significance (level of distress) and differentiation from an eating disorder.\n\nThough BDD has a lot in common with eating-disordered thinking, the two should not be conflated. Katherine Phillips, M.D., who is considered somewhat of a god in the BDD world, wrote in her book The Broken Mirror, \u201cBecause of their differences it\u2019s important to differentiate BDD from eating disorders and diagnose them separately.\u201d\n\nBDD concerns can be about weight and size, but they usually have to do with other aspects of the body. Phillips writes, \u201cIf a person\u2019s concerns focus on the hips, stomach, or thighs but not on overall body weight, and the person doesn\u2019t have notably abnormal eating behavior or otherwise meet criteria for an eating disorder, I diagnose BDD.\u201d\n\nI knew from my research that BDD is a stubborn, treatment-resistant disorder. It\u2019s also, as far as psychologists know, not helped by plastic surgery. According to Phillips, \u201cIneffective treatments include surgery, dermatologic treatment and other nonpsychiatric treatment.\u201d Her studies suggest that 6 to 20 percent of people who visit plastic surgeons\u2019 offices have BDD. Getting surgery might help their anxiety temporarily, but it usually returns in another form. A woman who is obsessed with her large nose, for example, might get a nose job and then shift attention to her thinning hair.\n\nOn one level, I understood this. On another, I still wanted a dermal filler.\n\nI researched my options. There was Juvederm and Voluma and Restylane, which a woman on an acne forum recommended to me. I visited my local plastic surgery office for a consultation, then panicked when offered an injection.\n\nAt the same time, I applied to several OCD treatment programs around the country. Two also treat BDD. In March, McLean Hospital\u2019s OCD Institute sent me an acceptance letter. I finished my classes for the year and moved into Orchard House, a white Victorian three-story separated from the main hospital campus by a thin road. I engaged in four hours of exposure therapy every day. I was instructed to hold my phone at an angle that exaggerated my dimple. After examining it for 30 seconds, I shifted focus to anything else \u2014 reading, writing, cooking.\n\nThe first few weeks I did this, I didn\u2019t see the point. I was used to looking at my face in bad angles. I\u2019d been doing it for years. How could this make a difference? When I put the phone down after examining the dent, all I could think about was the image I\u2019d just seen. It felt burned into my mind.\n\n\u201cI wonder if you can get PTSD from obsessive thoughts,\u201d said a friend of mine at the OCD Institute. He struggled with intrusive thoughts of raping and murdering women. It was lunchtime; we were eating sticky white rice at a table that fit all eight of us. I thought of the harm-related thoughts I\u2019d had in seventh grade, of dark shapes against a blue sky, of my reflection in a car window.\n\nMy therapists at McLean told me over and over that I wasn\u2019t at the hospital to change my thoughts. You can only change your actions, we were told. But eventually, if you reduce your rituals, your thoughts might change too. We traced the cognitive behavioral triangle on a whiteboard every week. The vertices on the triangle stood for our thoughts, behaviors and feelings. Of these three, we were responsible for only one: our actions.\n\nThe only thing I could control was how frequently I looked in the mirror. And they were making it very hard for me to do that.\n\nI argued with my therapist about getting a filler. She reminded me that BDD patients who have plastic surgery or change their appearance frequently regret the procedure or find a new body part on which to fixate. She was sure the same would happen to me.\n\nI left McLean in the middle of August, after nine weeks. Though I didn\u2019t feel entirely comfortable with my appearance (not the point, my therapist would be quick to say), I\u2019d gone from 100 mirror checks a day to five. I focused on value-based living, a core tenet of ACT (acceptance and commitment therapy), which is central to OCD/BDD treatment. My reassurance-seeking also improved.\n\nBefore McLean, I asked all the people I met what they thought of my face. The small relief I felt from every compliment was short-lasting and only led to the need for more.\n\nBDD patients who have plastic surgery or change their appearance frequently regret the procedure or find a new body part on which to fixate.\n\nA month after I left McLean, in a fog of panic, I made an appointment with the nearest plastic surgeon who accepted CareCredit. I quieted the reminders my brain was sending about not making decisions when upset. I went into the office on a Friday. I had to shine my phone flashlight on my face for the physician assistant \u2014 the woman who would be doing the injection \u2014 to even see what I was talking about.\n\nShe poked at the area, which she remarked was the size of an eraser, with a purple pen. A constellation of dots appeared. She put a cool, clear numbing cream on it and left the room for 20 minutes. When she re-entered, she offered me a stress ball. I asked for a second one. They didn\u2019t have another, but how about a breast implant? Sure. I held the stress ball in one hand and the lumpy, faintly glittery implant in the other.\n\n\u201cJust a pinch,\u201d she said.\n\nAt the pinch, I inhaled sharply and jumped slightly in the chair, then worried that this had upset the whole process, that the filler was already migrating to another part of my cheek. But she said nothing. Finally, she stepped back. The nurses were smiling.\n\n\u201cDoes it look different already?\u201d I asked. They nodded. I took the mirror. Except for the purple dots, I didn\u2019t see anything. I said this out loud, then added, \u201cMaybe that\u2019s the point.\u201d I turned my face at a familiar angle, the skin on my right cheek bunching up to reveal any unevenness. I could still see the dent, but it was less visible. I celebrated by going to a restaurant and eating a cheeseburger with a knife and fork, not wanting to chew too vigorously and displace the filler.\n\nBut my mood \u2014 and my rituals \u2014 didn\u2019t change. Over the next few days, I checked my face in all kinds of lighting. I made an unnecessary trip to my bank, a sign in the entryway invites customers to \u201cmeet the owners of your credit union.\u201d Below those words is a mirror. I had always hated my reflection in this mirror, which spans the length of the wall. If I stood a certain way, two light sources \u2014 the light from outside and artificial lighting in the building \u2014 cast my dent in sharp relief. I approached the mirror tentatively. Post-filler, my cheek looked a little smoother, though if I turned my head to the left, I could see a slight divot where the filler had not spread. The indentation was not gone \u2014 a result that would have devastated me before McLean. But I felt surprisingly fine. I took a deep breath and resolved to review my notes from the summer. It was clear that psychiatric treatment, not cosmetic, had always been the answer, even though I had resisted it for so long.\n\nI worried that some might be offended by this article, by the idea of a woman being so upset by a dent on her face that she spends thousands of dollars on psychiatric treatment. But that\u2019s the crux of it: Body dysmorphic disorder may concern the body \u2014 it\u2019s in the name \u2014 but it is a psychiatric illness. Just as we now know eating disorders have nothing to do with vanity, we need to extend the same understanding to BDD.\n\nIt is very likely that my obsession will shift to another part of my body. I\u2019m almost certain I will develop a different OCD-related obsession in my lifetime. I\u2019ve accepted that my life is going to be defined in large part by relapse and recovery. But my symptom-free years have been some of the happiest. I feel grateful to have some relief for now.", "The Twitter account of the Washington Examiner, a conservative news site, had some unusually feisty words for President Donald Trump on Monday morning, saying that he is \u201cgoing to hell\u201d for failing to obtain \u201cGod\u2019s forgiveness.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrump is going to hell,\u201d the tweet read. \u201cAnyone who ever read the bible can tell you where it stands on rich adulterers.

Republicans across the country have tried to separate us based on our differences, as if people who look like me \u2014 the daughter of Pakistani immigrants, a Muslim and a person of color \u2014 are the \u201cother.\u201d\n\nThis summer, my younger sister, who does not wear a headscarf so she doesn\u2019t immediately come across as Muslim, was having a great conversation with a voter she met while canvassing on my behalf. That is, until she handed the voter my campaign card, which features a photograph of me. Suddenly the voter said, \u201cI am not interested\u201d \u2014 and slammed her front door.\n\nWhile that kind of blatant prejudice is rare, my campaign did feel compelled to create a video emphasizing that I am the girl who ran the bases playing softball at George Pierce Park, graduated from North Gwinnett High School, volunteered at the Suwanee Fest, watched the parade each year in Duluth and earned the HOPE scholarship to the University of Georgia.\n\nRepublicans across the country have tried to separate us based on our differences, as if people who look like me are the 'other.'\n\nPortraying candidates of color as \u201cdifferent\u201d or \u201calien\u201d is nothing new. Donald Trump famously \u2014 and falsely \u2014 suggested that President Barack Obama was not an American citizen, demanding to see his birth certificate. And now, with more women, minorities and first-time candidates running for public office than ever before, white male establishment politicians are running scared. In one recent high-profile ad, indicted Rep. Duncan Hunter Jr. (R-Calif.) attacked his rival Ammar Campa-Najjar, implying that he is a terrorist \u201cworking to infiltrate Congress\u201d and is \u201cbeing funded by the Muslim Brotherhood.\u201d\n\nThere have been other obstacles for me. As a first-time candidate, I was a bit na\u00efve about what it meant to run for office. I imagined all the fun stuff \u2014 marching in parades, giving speeches, talking to voters and going to events. But I also had to quickly learn the nuts and bolts of how to run a campaign: opening a bank account, filing campaign finance forms, building a staff and raising money.\n\nA bigger difficulty was running for a newly open seat as a progressive Democrat in a deep red state \u2014 a seat that has been held by a Republican white man since I\u2019ve been alive. No Democrat has so much as challenged the Republican incumbent here in at least 14 years, but now the incumbent is retiring.\n\nDuring the primary, when I would knock on voters\u2019 doors, people were surprised to see a Democrat. They would say, \u201cGood luck!\u201d as if I were on some totally quixotic mission. It\u2019s been hard to get across the idea that just because it\u2019s been a Republican state and a Republican district for the past 25 years doesn\u2019t mean it has to stay that way.\n\nJust because it\u2019s been a Republican state and a Republican district for the past 25 years doesn\u2019t mean it has to stay that way.\n\nRecently, we hit another potential stumbling block. Gwinnett County officials decided to reject large numbers of mail-in ballots from people of color\u2014an issue that resulted in two federal lawsuits. Just last week, thankfully, a federal judge ordered election officials to stop summarily tossing absentee ballots because of mismatched signatures. Still, the threat of voter suppression remains; the state reportedly plans to appeal the judge\u2019s ruling.\n\nGeorgia is just one of many places around the country where Republican officials are trying to disenfranchise voters of color. They have enacted \u201cexact match\u201d laws, which can disqualify voters for minor clerical errors, and \u201cuse it or lose it\u201d laws, which strike voters from registration rolls for not voting in prior elections. They have also closed or shifted polling places and used handwriting analysis to throw out absentee ballots \u2014 all tactics that have been shown to disproportionately impact voters of color.\n\nOf course, moves to muzzle the voices and votes of minority voters are also meant to discourage candidates like me from running in the first place\u00ad. They know it will make the race more daunting.\n\nYou might think that all of these hurdles would make me the poster child for what a candidate running for a state legislature in the Deep South should not be. But you\u2019d be wrong.\n\nSure, in any other election cycle, race, religion, ethnicity or age might be a barrier to seeking office, especially in the South. But in midterm elections, where there is a visceral backlash to President Trump\u2019s racism and misogyny, we are seeing a sea change in the types of people who are running up and down the ballot.\n\nMoves to muzzle the voices and votes of minority voters are also meant to discourage candidates like me from running in the first place\u00ad.\n\nIn my own state, there are a record number of women vying for public office, including my GOP opponent. Among them: Zahra Karinshak, an Iranian-American military veteran who is a candidate for state Senate, Lucy McBath, an African-American gun-reform activist running for Congress, and Stacey Abrams, who is poised to make history as the first African-American governor in the country.\n\nJust seeing who else was running this year made me feel more confident about jumping into my race \u2014 and telling my story.\n\nI\u2019ve long been a passionate advocate for the people of this district, especially those who have been historically underrepresented. In graduate school, I founded an organization to engage Muslim Americans in the political process because I saw that people in my community were not voting, and so they didn\u2019t have a voice. As the policy director for a nonprofit legal and advocacy center, I\u2019ve fought for the civil rights of immigrants and people of color by working with legislators on both sides of the aisle.\n\nGiven my history of advocacy, it was a natural next step for me to want to represent my district in the state House. In fact, people never asked me if I was going to run for office; they just asked me when I was going to run.\n\nThe answer, as turns out, is now. Now is the perfect time to make the case for why someone like me is well suited to represent all voters and why, after a quarter of a century, it might just be time for a change. Even if my hijab necessitates a little extra explaining at the outset.", "The two sons of slain journalist Jamal Khashoggi have joined his fiancee, Hatice Cengiz, in asking Saudi Arabia to facilitate the return of their father\u2019s body in order to perform a traditional burial.\n\n\u201cAll what we want right now is to bury him in Al-Baqi (cemetery) in Medina (Saudi Arabia) with the rest of his family,\u201d Salah Khashoggi, 35, told CNN in an interview that aired Sunday. \u201cI talked about that with the Saudi authorities and I just hope that it happens soon.\u201d\n\nJamal Khashoggi disappeared after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2. Multiple narratives have since emerged about what happened to him, with the Saudis first denying responsibility only to later recant and acknowledge that a team of \u201crogue\u201d operatives carried out the killing.\n\nAccording to Turkish officials, Khashoggi was beheaded, dismembered and killed inside the embassy. Saudi officials reportedly then tried to wipe away the evidence. A Turkish official said last week that his body may have been dissolved in acid.\n\n\u201cKhashoggi\u2019s body was not in need of burying,\u201d a senior Turkish official told The Washington Post.\n\n\u201cI really hope that whatever happened wasn\u2019t painful for him, or it was quick. Or he had a peaceful death,\u201d Abdullah Khashoggi, 33, said in the CNN interview.\n\nBoth sons spoke of their father as a well-liked, \u201cmoderate\u201d person, attempting to dispel the narrative that he maintained links to extremism. Saudi officials reportedly considered him part of the Muslim Brotherhood, an Egyptian political organization that some countries consider a terror group.", "Armed bands of civilian militia members are traveling to the southern U.S. border, where President Donald Trump has ordered thousands of active-duty troops to rebuff the approaching migrant caravan.\n\nAbout \u201c200 unregulated armed militia members [are] currently operating along the southwest border,\u201c says a planning document for Army commanders leading the 5,200 troops Trump has deployed at the border, according to Newsweek. The groups \u201coperate under the guise of citizen patrols supporting\u201d border officials, the document says, pointing out \u201creported incidents of unregulated militias stealing National Guard equipment during deployments.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Border Patrol late last month warned landowners in Texas to expect \u201cpossible armed civilians\u201d to come onto their property because of the caravan, The Associated Press reported.\n\nMilitia groups \u2015 heavily armed organizations that train members in paramilitary techniques \u2015 often are right-wing extremist organizations. The Southern Poverty Law Center identified 689 active anti-government extremist groups in 2017. Of those, 273 were militias.\n\nOne militia group, the Texas Minutemen, has 100 volunteers heading to the Rio Grande to block migrants now traveling through Mexico, leader Shannon McGauley told The Washington Post. The untrained volunteers plan to dig in along border spots with camouflage clothing, flak jackets, semiautomatic weapons, night-vision goggles and aerial drones with thermal sensing equipment to locate people in darkness, McGauley said. They\u2019ll also come with camping gear and food supplies.\n\nMilitia leaders echo Trump\u2019s pre-election, anti-migrant hyperbole that the migrants are \u201cinvaders\u201d and that the borders must be protected. Photos and videos of the caravan show large numbers of mothers and children.\n\n\u201cWe believe our nation is under attack by foreigners who refuse to accept the rule of law on how to become a citizen in the United States,\u201d Howie Morgan, the political action director of the Minuteman Project militia, told Newsweek. He said he hoped to see \u201cthousands\u201d of civilians join troops to defend the border.\n\nThe Minuteman Project \u2014 in conjunction with the Texas Minutemen \u2014 issued an \u201curgent\u201d call to action last week on its website urging members to set up camp along the border for 90 days.\n\nThe organizations are \u201ccalling out to everyone to converge on the U.S.-Mexico border immediately to support U.S. law enforcement and military organizations already there. Your presence is needed everywhere along the 2,000-mile border from San Diego, California, to Brownsville, Texas,\u201d the website says.\n\nThe Minuteman Project website, warning of a \u201clarge number of criminals\u201d crossing the border, also encourages people to establish their own armed groups. \u201cSeveral U.S. law enforcement officers and civilians have been murdered by international bandits in these areas,\u201d the website declares.\n\nThe group calls on volunteers to follow the law and confer with law enforcement before taking any action. \u201cWe want survivors, not casualties, so proceed with extreme caution!\u201d It also urges members to \u201cuse extreme caution when confronted by mainstream media. \u201cThey are not your friends. They work for their globalist, open-border $$-sponsors-$$,\u201d says the site.\n\nThe Patriots of the Constitution militia put out a call last month for a \u201cfull deployment\u201d to make a \u201cstand to secure our border from a mob of migrating immigrants,\u201d the Albuquerque Journal reported.\n\nTrump said last week that rocks thrown by immigrants should be considered a firearm, and that the military would fight back. He later said he was suggesting that rock-throwing immigrants would be arrested \u2014 not shot.", "New York City police are searching for the culprit who left hate-filled graffiti last week on the historic African Burial Ground National Monument in Manhattan. The vandal\u2019s message, penned in black marker on a monument plaque, contained a racist slur and suggested black people should be killed.\n\nThe offensive graffiti was quickly removed, but community leaders expressed outrage that no one has been apprehended.\n\n\u201cSome lowlife come and on this monument right back here and write \u2018kill the N\u2019s.\u2019 You must be out of your mind if you think we\u2019ll remain silent. We want an arrest,\u201d state Assemblyman Charles Barron said on Sunday, according to CBS News.\n\n(A warning to readers: An uncensored image of the racist graffiti is posted below.)\n\nLocated steps from City Hall, the monument marks a burial ground that contains about 15,000 skeletal remains of African-Americans who lived and worked in colonial New York. Those buried at the site, many of whom were slaves, weren\u2019t allowed to be interred in traditional church cemeteries at the time of their deaths.\n\nAccording to the monument\u2019s website, the site is the \u201coldest and largest known excavated burial ground in North America for both free and enslaved Africans. It protects the historic role slavery played in building New York City.\u201d\n\nNow what about the anti-black hate downtown at African Burial Ground? https://t.co/hx0rjQI5vy pic.twitter.com/XSeSNMaxvx \u2014 Laura Flanders (@GRITlaura) November 3, 2018\n\nThe vandalism at the monument occurred Thursday \u2014 the same day that Brooklyn\u2019s Union Temple was vandalized with violent anti-Semitic messages, and the same week that several graffitied swastikas were found in Manhattan and Brooklyn. Days earlier, on Oct. 27, a gunman entered the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh and killed 11 people in the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in U.S. history.\n\nDermot Shea, NYPD chief of detectives, told reporters last week that the city had seen an increase in \u201canti-Semitic hate crimes, particularly swastikas, on buildings in parts of the city,\u201d according to The New York Times.\n\nOn Sunday, the New York-based group Jews for Racial & Economic Justice responded to the vandalism of the African Burial Ground monument with a message of solidarity.\n\n\u201cOur communities will keep holding each other close. We will not turn on each other. We are in this together,\u201d the group wrote on Twitter.", "Julia Louis-Dreyfus, who recently received the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor, wasn\u2019t looking for laughs this time.\n\nFor years Donald Trump has been spreading fear, encouraging racism and inciting violence.

Presented with a short list of Trump\u2019s most frequent falsehoods, she countered with a homemade placard with a photo showing Louis Farrakhan with former Democratic President Barack Obama and demanded to know why the media wasn\u2019t covering that.\n\nShe added that she was not interested in whether or how many times Trump might lie that evening. \u201cI don\u2019t care if he sprouts a third dick up there,\u201d she said.\n\n(She declined to give her name or to elaborate on her views of the president\u2019s anatomy.)\n\nHer response, though, was typical of fans so committed to Trump that they take time off from work and spend hours in the rain or under a blazing sun to listen to his speeches. And it highlights the other half of the president\u2019s destruction of the truth: As Trump has passed through the looking glass into a make-pretend world of invented facts, legions of his fans have happily followed him.\n\nJennifer Petito, who drove across the state from Melbourne to see Trump, was similarly dismissive of proof that Trump\u2019s claims are false.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe that,\u201d she said, joining in with the verbal assault on HuffPost for daring to challenge Trump\u2019s version of reality. \u201cI don\u2019t believe he would lie like that.\u201d\n\nTom Nichols, a professor at the Naval War College and the author of the recent book, \u201cThe Death of Expertise,\u201d said the Trump supporters\u2019 response does not surprise him in the least.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of scientific explanations for it, but most of them boil down to \u2018shooting the messenger.\u2019 Deep down, they know that these things are false. They don\u2019t care,\u201d Nichols said. \u201cWhat they object to is the sense of inferiority created when someone tells them that the things they know to be false are actually false.\u201d\n\nAs those monitoring Trump\u2019s speeches even casually have noted, Trump began ramping up dishonesties in service of GOP candidates about two months ago. The Washington Post found that Trump\u2019s more frequent speeches combined with more prevarications per speech have raised his average number of false statements per day to 30 \u2013 making these past seven weeks a veritable festival of falsehoods.\n\nTrump supporters\u2019 efforts to defend these untruths often put them in the position of denying the existence of any objective truth at all. Everything becomes a matter of opinion or perspective.\n\nFour days later and 600 miles northwest awaiting Trump\u2019s rally at Pensacola airport, Gene Ponder, a high school government and politics teacher in Daphne, Alabama, wound up arguing that there was no real difference between having built a wall and falsely claiming to have built one.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of semantics,\u201d he said, and pointed out that falsely claiming to have built a wall was an effective campaign tool. \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful campaigning for the Republican Party in congressional seats around the country, to stimulate the base.\u201d\n\nWhat they [Trump supporters] object to is the sense of inferiority created when someone tells them that the things they know to be false are actually false. Tom Nichols, professor at the Naval War College\n\nTo be among the first handful of attendees to get into the Fort Myers hockey arena, Virginia Alonso drove across Alligator Alley from Fort Lauderdale the previous afternoon. She and a friend slept in lawn chairs under the stars, and a few hours before the start of the rally were in place right outside the entry doors.\n\nWith only a short time left before the doors were opened, the Cuban-American retiree was in little mood to hear about Trump\u2019s falsehoods. She regarded the single page HuffPost had asked her to review with suspicion.\n\nWhile Trump typically has been putting out many dozens of falsehoods and exaggerations per hour-long rally, HuffPost curated five with which to interview rally-goers: 1) Trump has received nearly $5 billion already to build his wall; 2) military veterans got the ability to see private doctors in the event of long waiting lists thanks to Trump; 3) his recent $716 billion military budget is the largest ever; 4) U.S. Steel is opening as many as eight new plants thanks to Trump\u2019s tariffs; 5) and the real name of the Democratic Party is the \u201cDemocrat\u201d Party.\n\nAll five are flatly untrue and easily disproven. In reality, Trump has received zero funding from Congress for wall construction; veterans received that choice under President Obama; the largest recent military budget was also under Obama; U.S. Steel is opening zero new plants; and the real name of the Democratic Party is, in fact, the Democratic Party.\n\n\u201cWhy should I believe you?\u201d Alonso said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you.\u201d\n\nOthers near the entrance doors who had likewise spent a chilly night and then a steamy, hot afternoon outside so that they could get in first were similarly outraged by HuffPost\u2019s list.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t like fake news. Why would he say things that are not true?\u201d asked Barbara Guzman, who owns a label-making business in nearby Cape Coral. \u201cMost of the things he says I agree with, and I believe.\u201d\n\nFurther back in line, even those who had invested far less of their time to see Trump were just as defensive.\n\nOne man who would not give his name said HuffPost\u2019s list of falsehoods was unfair because it had only five items and because it did not contain an equal number of good things Trump had done.\n\n\u201cThis is fake news!\u201d he shouted, repeating the line Trump regularly uses to describe reporting that does not flatter him.\n\nMarie Brausan, who lives in the Chicago suburbs but winters in Fort Myers, said if the news media didn\u2019t like Trump\u2019s words, it was their own fault for criticizing him all the time rather than giving him positive feedback, as a parent does with a toddler.\n\n\u201cOf course I want him to be truthful and honest,\u201d she said, but added: \u201cThe bottom line is he is not a politician, he is doing what he said he\u2019d do, and I trust him.\u201d\n\nMost of those approached by HuffPost at Trump\u2019s second Florida rally in four days in Pensacola Saturday had similar reactions.\n\n\u201cHe does what he says he\u2019s going to do,\u201d said a Penscola woman who would only give her first name, Diane. But after learning that Trump had not, as he has claimed, started building a wall, she said that it didn\u2019t really matter. \u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t bother me, because he\u2019s going to make everything balance out in the end.\u201d\n\nOnce a con man cons somebody, there is a bias among the marks not to admit that they\u2019re that stupid. In this particular one, they want it to go on and on. They love it. Longtime GOP consultant and Trump critic Rick Wilson\n\nRick Wilson, the author of the recent \u201cEverything Trump Touches Dies\u201d and a longtime GOP consultant in Florida who opposed Trump from the start, said the president\u2019s supporters are the victims of a con artist.\n\n\u201cOnce a con man cons somebody, there is a bias among the marks not to admit that they\u2019re that stupid,\u201d he said. \u201cIn this particular one, they want it to go on and on. They love it.\u201d\n\nNichols, also a Trump critic, said that the gulf between what supporters believed Trump would bring and what he has actually delivered is clearly causing mental anguish for them. \u201cWhen you start from the assumption that they know they\u2019re wrong, and how the immensity of the cognitive dissonance makes them deeply uncomfortable, the rest of their reactions start to make a lot more sense,\u201d he said.\n\nThat cognitive dissonance was visible among some Trump supporters who seemed disappointed at learning the facts belying Trump\u2019s claims. Yet even those who told HuffPost that they are troubled by his falsehoods almost always found some mitigating factor to excuse them. Hillary Clinton. Democrats generally. The Bernie Sanders supporter who opened fire at a congressional Republicans\u2019 baseball practice. Planned Parenthood.\n\nIn Pensacola, retired Defense Department project manager Armando Hernandez shrugged off Trump\u2019s falsehoods entirely. \u201cWell, a lot of people believe him,\u201d he said of Trump, and then unloaded on Democrats. \u201cDemocrats say whatever they want to say, even if it\u2019s false. The last Democrat I voted for was Jimmy Carter and that was the worst mistake I ever made.\u201d\n\nDenny Elkins, a technician with the local Glass Doctor franchise, said he couldn\u2019t explain why Trump felt compelled to lie so much but that, in the end, it wasn\u2019t important. \u201cI\u2019m more comforted having him as president, even if he doesn\u2019t tell all the truth all of the time,\u201d he said. \u201cIt makes me ill to think that Hillary could have been president. In my opinion, you can\u2019t trust a thing she says.\u201d\n\nBack in Estero, retired economist Tom Walton said that Trump\u2019s advanced age might factor into all his untruths \u2013 the way Ronald Reagan\u2019s dementia was affecting his words and decisions in his second term. Like many others, Walton, who is 73, said that the strength of the economy and Trump\u2019s appointments to the Supreme Court and efforts to roll back business regulations outweighed his negatives.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t bother me. No one\u2019s got a perfect memory,\u201d Walton said of Trump\u2019s propensity for falsehoods. \u201cHe\u2019s got a lot on his mind.\u201d\n\nOne 75-year-old woman who declined to give her name said she supported Trump because Obama had doubled the national debt in his two terms in office. But when it was pointed out that Trump was on track to have $1 trillion annual deficits during a strong economy, she demanded to know why the media has not covered that. She added that she watches Fox News religiously and had not seen that mentioned.\n\nOne rally-goer who attended more out of curiosity than adoration for Trump, though, said the falsehoods of what he had accomplished could come back to bite Trump \u2013 particularly regarding his singular promise from the 2016 campaign, that he would build a wall along the border with Mexico.\n\n\u201cIf in another year or so there hasn\u2019t been a wall started, he\u2019s going to have a big problem,\u201d said Phil Deems, a commercial real estate broker in Naples, who added that that could serve as a consequence for all the dishonesties. \u201cIt kind of fixes itself.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, however, Deems\u2019 point of view appears to be in an exceedingly small minority among the universe of Trump supporters.\n\nVirginia Alonso, walking out of the arena after hearing Trump repeat four of the five falsehoods on HuffPost\u2019s list that evening, said the day-and-a-half wait to see him had been worth it.", "Former White House photographer Pete Souza added to the growing number of tributes commemorating the 10-year anniversary of Barack Obama\u2019s election on Sunday night, sharing a previously unpublished photo of the former president to Instagram.\n\nTaken on election night 2008, the image, which was captured \u201cthrough tears\u201d by Souza, shows Obama embracing daughter Malia in Chicago after the historic win.\n\n\u201cI remember a photographer-friend said to me that night, \u2018I\u2019m so glad I\u2019m alive to see this happen,\u2019\u201d Souza wrote in the photo\u2019s caption. \u201cHe, too, had tears in his eyes. And little did I know that just a couple of months later I would receive a phone call that would change the rest of my life.\u201d", "John Oliver tore into President Donald Trump on Sunday for fearmongering about immigration, particularly the caravan of asylum-seekers traveling on foot from Central America.\n\n\u201cWomen don\u2019t want them in our country,\u201d Trump claimed last week. \u201cWomen want security.

Cross described Wright as a businessman with \u201csome background in software.\u201d\n\nThe Coalition for Good Governance, a plaintiff in the voting integrity lawsuit against Kemp, issued a statement decrying his outsourcing of the the voter registration database and electronic poll book voter check-in system to a third party, PCC Technologies.\n\n\u201cThere are still immediate steps that Secretary Kemp and the State Election Board can take to mitigate some, but not all, of the risk for Tuesday\u2019s vote,\u201d the group said.\n\nEfforts to reach PCC for comment have not been successful.\n\nThe drama played out on a day Kemp campaigned alongside President Donald Trump in Macon. Trump made no mention of the issue at the rally and earlier, as he left the White House for Georgia, said he didn\u2019t know anything about it.\n\nThe finger-pointing is the latest turn in a campaign whose final weeks have been dominated by charges of voter suppression and countercharges of attempted voter fraud.\n\nAbrams, who would be the nation\u2019s first black female governor, has called Kemp \u201can architect of voter suppression\u201d and says he\u2019s used his current post to make it harder for certain voters to cast ballots. Kemp counters that he\u2019s following state and federal law and that it\u2019s Abrams and her affiliated voting advocacy groups trying to help people, including noncitizens, cast ballots illegally.\n\nStacey Abrams on Georgia Secretary of State\u2019s office opening an investigation into the Democratic party of Georgia for possible alleged cyber crimes: \u201cThis is a desperate attempt on the part of my opponent to distract people\u201d #CNNSOTU pic.twitter.com/CzVrwqTKkB \u2014 CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) November 4, 2018\n\nThe atmosphere has left partisans and good-government advocates alike worrying about the possibility that the losing side will not accept Tuesday\u2019s results as legitimate.\n\nThe accusation is not the first from Kemp accusing outsiders of trying to penetrate his office. Immediately after the 2016 general election, Kemp declared that DHS tried to hack his office\u2019s network, an accusation dismissed in mid-2017 by the DHS inspector general as unfounded.\n\nEven before he was running for governor, Kemp faced criticism over Georgia\u2019s election system.\n\nGeorgia\u2019s centrally managed elections system lacks a verifiable paper trail that can be audited in case of problems. The state is one of just five nationwide that continues to rely exclusively on aged electronic voting machines that computer scientists have long criticized as untrustworthy because they are easily hacked and don\u2019t leave a paper trail.\n\nIn 2015, Kemp\u2019s office inadvertently released the Social Security numbers and other identifying information of millions of Georgia voters. His office blamed a clerical error.\n\nHis office made headlines again last year after security experts disclosed a gaping security hole that wasn\u2019t fixed until six months after it was first reported to election authorities. Personal data was again exposed for Georgia voters \u2014 6.7 million at the time \u2014 as were passwords used by county officials to access files.\n\nKemp\u2019s office laid the blame for that breach on Kennesaw State University, which managed the system on Kemp\u2019s behalf.", "Comedian Pete Davidson came under fire this weekend after mocking a Republican candidate for Congress\u2019 eye patch during a \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d sketch.\n\nDavidson cracked a joke about the eyepatch former Navy SEAL Dan Crenshaw wears, likening the Texas Republican\u2019s appearance to \u201ca hitman in a porno movie.\u201d\n\nWith a photo of Crenshaw over his shoulder, Davidson remarked: \u201cThis guy\u2019s kind of cool.\u201d Weekend Update co-anchor Michael Che indicated this might not be a good idea, saying, \u201cOh, c\u2019mon, man.\u201d\n\nBut Davidson continued: \u201cYou may be surprised to hear he\u2019s a congressional candidate from Texas and not a hitman in a porno movie.

But he also gave Senate testimony that was critical in bringing down Nixon for covering up the scandal after a break-in at Democratic National Committee offices at the Watergate office complex in Washington, D.C.\n\nDean has gone after Trump hard this year.\n\nHe quipped in an interview with Rolling Stone that Nixon, who resigned the presidency in 1974, might have remained in the White House if Fox News had existed then to protect him. He also called Trump \u201cthe most incompetent person to ever become president,\u201d and accused him of being \u201cnot only insecure and erratic, but uninformed, for he doesn\u2019t read history, or know it.\u201d\n\nDean then appeared pessimistic about Trump ever resigning or being removed from office for misconduct because of the political climate.\n\nBut more recently, he has expressed more optimism with the arrest of Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, and after White House counsel Don McGahn\u2019s cooperation with special investigator Robert Mueller. McGahn did the \u201cright thing,\u201d Dean said in August.\n\nAfter it was revealed in September that Manafort had decided to cooperate with Mueller as part of a plea deal, Dean tweeted: \u201cBOOM!\u201d", "It\u2019s official. Rick Grimes rolled under the big dumpster in the sky. But, surprisingly, Andrew Lincoln\u2019s exit from \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d isn\u2019t even the wildest thing to happen in the most recent episode.\n\nAfter news of Lincoln\u2019s impending departure from the show leaked over the summer, AMC began teasing the actor\u2019s final moments with marketing promos, videos and an emotional letter from Lincoln himself, reassuring us that his time on the show had come to an end.\n\nAnd it sort of did on Sunday night.\n\nIn his penultimate episode, Rick Grimes appeared to be impaled by a large piece of metal, stuck in place with zombies closing in. Thanks to numerous photos and a teaser of the episodes\u2019 first few minutes released by AMC ahead of Sunday\u2019s airing, we knew he\u2019d pulled himself off the metal bar with the help of his belt and led the zombie herds on a wild chase to the bridge the communities have been building, all the while spewing blood everywhere.\n\nJackson Lee Davis/AMC [Vin Diesel voice]: \"One last ride.\"\n\nWhen the full episode aired, we watched as Grimes was visited by the ghosts of \u201cWalking Dead\u201d past in three different visions on his quest to \u201clook for his family.\u201d Jon Bernthal\u2019s Shane Walsh returned to give Grimes inspiration, Scott Wilson\u2019s Hershel Greene implored the formerly passed out protagonist to wake up, and Sonequa Martin-Green\u2019s Sasha arrived to explain to him that people never really die. (She\u2019s obviously taking poetic liberties here because, huh, has she ever seen an episode of \u201cWalking Dead\u201d? People die, a lot.)\n\nPrior to the episode, we guessed that shots from the San Diego Comic-Con trailer would predict how Grimes\u2019 closing performance would play out \u2015 and we were right, even down to the one last hallucination Rick experienced after he arrived at the bridge, which appeared to show the flickers of a rescue.\n\nDuring the hallucination, Rick realizes that the \u201cfamily\u201d he\u2019s been looking for isn\u2019t blood relation, like dead son Carl (Chandler Riggs). It\u2019s his new family, the other living survivors like Michonne (Danai Gurira) and Daryl (Norman Reedus). (I mean, I could\u2019ve probably told you that, dude. But do your thing.)\n\nRick snaps himself out of his fever dream and realizes he\u2019s gotta find someway to takeout the herd of zombies before they end up rolling through all the communities. The real, non-hallucinated Michonne, Daryl and other survivors show up in time to witness Grimes detonate some dynamite on the bridge, blowing himself and the ensuing zombies to smithereens. The zombies and Rick all wash away in the raging water below.\n\nAnd that, everyone, is the end of Rick Grimes.\n\nWell, almost. Did you really think a simple explosion could take out Rick?\n\nJust as Glenn (Steven Yeun) miraculously rolled under a dumpster to avoid zombies back in Season 6, Rick somehow survives the explosion and conveniently winds up on the bank of a river near Jadis (Pollyanna McIntosh), who\u2019s arranging a helicopter transport at that very second. She tells the helicopter pilot that Rick is a \u201cB\u201d (one of the designations she uses for captives she\u2019d like to use in a trade with the helicopter group) and that he\u2019s badly hurt and needs help.\n\nAnd so the helicopter pilot accepts Rick and they all fly away ... and live happily ever after, we\u2019d assume? That\u2019s how Sheriff Rick Grimes, aka the Ricktator, aka the throat biter, aka the primary character in \u201cWalking Dead\u201d leaves the show. Rick doesn\u2019t die after all.\n\nIn fact, he might not even be gone that long. On \u201cTalking Dead\u201d following the show, Scott Gimple, the \u201cWalking Dead\u201d chief content officer, said AMC is going to make original Rick Grimes movies. What does that even mean? Time will tell.\n\nNow, back to this episode. At this point, the best part of the show was yet to come.\n\nAfter the helicopter flies off, some new survivors appear on the show, and they\u2019re having a tough time evading zombies. Eventually, they\u2019re saved by some good Samaritan shooting just enough undead for them to escape. Wait. What\u2019s this?

But so do people who rely on Medicaid, even though they\u2019ve gotten a lot less attention this election cycle.\n\nAaron Robertson is one of those people. Robertson, 35, lives in Chelsea, Michigan, a city of roughly 5,000 people that\u2019s about an hour\u2019s drive west of Detroit. He works in a downtown coffee shop, making enough money to support himself but not enough to buy health insurance. He went without coverage for many years until 2015, when he signed up for Michigan\u2019s version of Medicaid.\n\nThe timing was fortuitous, because just a few months later, while helping his uncle perform some maintenance on a boat, he slipped off a 12-foot ladder and shattered several bones in his foot. The treatment would eventually involve two separate surgeries, plus months of rehabilitation.\n\nIt was painful, except in the financial sense. Medicaid took care of bills, leaving him with only a handful of out-of-pocket expenses.\n\n\u201cI was lucky,\u201d Robertson told me during a recent interview, on a rainy evening just days before the election. Without Medicaid, he figures, he would have ended up bankrupt and maybe permanently disabled, because he would have skipped follow-up care and probably the second surgery, even though the first procedure didn\u2019t fully repair the damage.\n\n\u201cI probably couldn\u2019t work, I\u2019m not sure what I would have done,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cHow can you afford anything if you can\u2019t work?\u201d\n\nHUFFPOST PHOTO/Jonathan Cohn Aaron Robertson enrolled in Medicaid when Michigan expanded the program and, shortly afterwards, he shattered his foot. \u201cI\u2019m really hoping they don\u2019t take it away,\u201d he says. \u201cThat would hurt a lot of people.\"\n\nRobertson was able to get on Medicaid because Michigan is one of 33 states that, along with the District of Columbia, has decided to take part in the ACA\u2019s expansion of the program.\n\nThat means the states have opened up their Medicaid programs to anybody with income below or just above the poverty line, instead of restricting enrollment to narrowly defined groups like children, pregnant women and people with disabilities. The federal government picks up most of the cost.\n\nThe effects have been dramatic. More than 680,000 Michiganders have gotten coverage through the expansion, according to official estimates. And that\u2019s emblematic of what\u2019s happened across the country.\n\nOverall, roughly 14 million people got insurance because of the Medicaid expansion, and that is the single biggest reason that the number of people without coverage has fallen to historic lows since the ACA took effect.\n\nBut those gains could vanish, depending on what happens Tuesday.\n\nIf Republicans hold onto both houses of Congress, they will almost certainly try once again to repeal the ACA. And if the legislation they consider looks anything like the proposals that they tried to pass last year, it will both eliminate the extra federal funding for the Medicaid expansion and ratchet down what the federal government spends on the rest of the program, as well.\n\nMost states would respond by dramatically pulling back on their Medicaid programs, returning eligibility to what it was before the expansion and cutting back on services even for traditional groups like children and the disabled.\n\nAs the writer Andrew Sprung put it recently at healthinsurance.org, Republican proposals \u201ccould permanently cripple Medicaid.\u201d\n\nAn easy way to measure the impact is by looking at the people who would have lost coverage if the American Health Care Act, the repeal bill that House Republicans passed in 2017, had become law. Overall, the Congressional Budget Office concluded, the number of people on Medicaid would have fallen by 14 million, effectively wiping out the last few years\u2019 gains.\n\nWhere Millions Stand To Lose Coverage\n\nThat\u2019s a big number, obviously. But it\u2019s a meaningful one too.\n\nA slew of studies, many based on data from the last few years since the expansion has gone into effect, show conclusively that, relative to people with no insurance, people on Medicaid end up better off. That might sound obvious, but it\u2019s actually something that conservative critics of the program, including some with powerful positions in President Donald Trump\u2019s administration, have questioned.\n\nSome of the most recent evidence of Medicaid\u2019s effectiveness happens to come from Michigan, where researchers from the University of Michigan have found that people who got Medicaid coverage were more likely to get cardiac services, for example, and less prone to large credit card debts, evictions and bankruptcy declarations.\n\nNancy Paul, executive director of Faith in Action in Chelsea, doesn\u2019t need a study to tell her about the expansion\u2019s impact.\n\n\"It\u2019s really easy, four or five years into this expansion from the Affordable Care Act, to forget what it was like for people.\" Nancy Paul, director of Chelsea's Faith in Action organization\n\nFor years, her organization worked with a local doctor and nurse to offer basic medical services for the poor. They stopped after the Medicaid expansion took effect because they realized it was no longer necessary. Would-be patients were finding their way to doctors, clinics and hospitals where they could get care on their own, and with Medicaid paying the cost.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really easy, four or five years into this expansion from the Affordable Care Act, to forget what it was like for people,\u201d Paul said.\n\nShe thinks especially of working parents whose children qualified for coverage under the old criteria but who had no way to pay for their own care. \u201cIf you\u2019re a single parent and trying to take care of your kids and be a decent parent, and you can\u2019t even take yourself to the doctor, how can you do it? You\u2019re going to be in big trouble.\u201d\n\nWhere Millions Stand To Gain Coverage\n\nMore than a thousand miles away, in Boise, Idaho, Penny Beach tells a very similar story \u2015 with one critical twist.\n\nBeach is medical director at the Family Medicine Residency of Idaho, a clinic that serves uninsured patients in and around the city. She doesn\u2019t have to remember what it was like before the Medicaid expansion, because Idaho is one of those 17 states where the Republican officials in charge have refused to take the extra federal money.\n\nSince eligibility hasn\u2019t budged, most of the state\u2019s low-income population still doesn\u2019t qualify.\n\nJonathan Cohn/HuffPost If Idaho expands Medicaid, Diann Sivels-Sharrer could finally get surgery for an injury that's making it difficult for her to keep working.\n\nBeach, who has been treating underserved populations for roughly 20 years, says that she is sure she\u2019s seen patients suffer because clinics like hers simply can\u2019t provide the kind of specialty services that patients need. Sometimes, she says, patients without insurance are afraid to come in and get tests because they worry so much about how they won\u2019t be able to pay for care.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had to admit patients to the hospital, people in their 50s suffering from heart attacks or strokes, because they have never been in to seek care for blood pressure or diabetes, even though maybe they could have found care,\u201d Beach said.\n\nOne of Beach\u2019s patients is Diann Sivels-Sharrer, a 57-year-old home health aide. She tends to a mother and daughter, each with mental and physical disabilities, but she also has serious health problems of her own, including a serious tear in her groin muscle that she thinks she got while lifting a wheelchair.\n\nShe needs surgery but hasn\u2019t gotten it yet, because she doesn\u2019t have insurance and can\u2019t pay the bills. When I met her a few weeks ago, at the Boise clinic, she needed to stand up and walk around in order to alleviate the pain.\n\nWhat Voters May Understand \u2015 And What They May Not\n\nBeach and Sivels-Sharrer are hoping for a change in fortunes \u2015 and they may get one. Idaho is one of three deeply conservative states where activists have taken matters into their own hands and gathered signatures for initiatives that would obligate states to accept federal money and expand Medicaid.\n\nIn two other states where Republicans have blocked expansion, Florida and Georgia, Democratic gubernatorial candidates Andrew Gillum and Stacey Abrams have pledged to push for expansion if they are elected.\n\nMedicaid has gotten a lot of attention in these states, because of the initiatives and because both Gillum and Abrams have made it centerpieces of their campaigns.\n\nIt\u2019s figured into some other campaigns, too, among them Michigan\u2019s gubernatorial race, because the Democratic nominee, former state senator Gretchen Whitmer, helped lead the fight for the state\u2019s expansion while her Republican opponent, Attorney General Bill Schuette, opposed it, although recently he has said the expansion is \u201cnot going anywhere.\u201d\n\nBut even some of the people who depend on Medicaid seem to realize their coverage depends on the election outcome \u2015 and that they have some power to determine that outcome.\n\nChelsea is part of Michigan\u2019s 7th U.S. House district and the longtime GOP incumbent, Tim Walberg, is running for re-election. His Democratic challenger, former state legislator Gretchen Driskell, has attacked Walberg for his vote on repeal and pointed out that 49,000 people in his district got coverage because of the expansion.\n\nIn the past, Republican critics like Walberg have said that Medicaid is too expensive and it\u2019s true that the program, like any government program, requires spending money that the taxpayers end up shouldering, one way or another. But Medicaid is, if anything, less expensive than private insurance \u2015 and the ACA, on the whole, offsets new government spending with a combination of higher taxes and cuts to other programs.\n\nAs it happens, though, Walberg isn\u2019t really making that argument anyway. Like his fellow Republicans around the country, he has tried to avoid the topic, which isn\u2019t surprising given that polls show voters trust Democrats more than Republicans on health care. Driskell is keeping the race close, even though the district has a distinct Republican lean.\n\nWhen Robertson and I spoke, outside the Chelsea coffee shop, I asked if he knew that the Medicaid expansion\u2019s future was in jeopardy \u2015 and that it might depend, in small part, on who he and other voters in the Michigan 7th send to Congress. He said he hadn\u2019t, though he said he was going to do some research before voting.", "Saturday Night on Broadway at @HamiltonMusical tonight. GO VOTE.

Show everyone what you\u2019re against or what you\u2019re for.\u201d\n\nMembers of the original Broadway cast \u2013 including the show\u2019s creator and star Lin-Manuel Miranda \u2013 have also released a video encouraging people to vote.\n\nIn it, Christopher Jackson, Daveed Diggs, Sasha Hutchings and Ariana DeBose share their experience voting for the first time. The video ends with Miranda saying, \u201cGo vote.\u201d\n\nThe country is asking to hear YOUR voice. Members of the Original Broadway Cast of @HamiltonMusical have rallied together to ask you to vote on November 6! #Ham4Vote pic.twitter.com/Z3YQenbjXZ \u2014 Hamilton (@HamiltonMusical) November 4, 2018\n\nThis isn\u2019t \u201cHamilton\u2019s\u201d first plunge into politics. The cast released a video encouraging voter turnout during the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThat year, \u201cHamilton\u201d also made headlines when cast member Brandon Dixon addressed then-vice president elect Mike Pence, who was in the audience. Dixon said from the stage, \u201cWe hope this show has inspired you to uphold our American values and work on behalf of all of us.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump later tweeted the show was \u201chighly overrated.\u201d", "Lots of Republicans have made egregiously dishonest statements about health care in the last few weeks. But few have done so with the aplomb of Martha McSally, Republican candidate for Senate in Arizona.\n\nShe has done it in her advertisements. She has done it in televised debates. And now she is doing in meetings with voters.\n\nA new video from American Bridge, a liberal political action committee, captured McSally speaking with attendees \u2015 including one who asked about McSally\u2019s 2017 vote to take away protections for people with pre-existing conditions.\n\n\u201cI did not,\u201d McSally says. \u201cThat\u2019s a lie. I voted to protect them.\u201d\n\nMcSally, of course, is the one who isn\u2019t telling the truth.\n\nRemarkable video: Martha McSally points her finger at voter and blatantly lies about her vote to repeal ACA, before McSally forcibly pushes her out of the way. pic.twitter.com/MJYLkaTS05 \u2014 Matt McDermott (@mattmfm) November 3, 2018\n\nMcSally is currently a member of the U.S. House of Representatives. And in 2017, she voted yes on the American Health Care Act, the GOP bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThat bill would have let states request waivers so that insurers could charge higher premiums to people with pre-existing conditions whose coverage had lapsed.\n\nThe waivers would also have let insurers offer plans without maternity care, mental health, prescription coverage and seven other benefits that the ACA deems essential \u2015 making coverage unattractive or flat-out unusable for people with serious medical problems.\n\nThe bill did offer states extra money to help take care of people who couldn\u2019t get insurance on their own, plus it had language stating that insurers couldn\u2019t discriminate against people with pre-existing medical conditions. But as countless independent experts pointed out, the language had no meaningful policy effect and the money wouldn\u2019t have been enough to take care of all the people who needed it.\n\nThe rest of the audio isn\u2019t that clear, but McSally seems to say something about how many people in Arizona still don\u2019t have affordable insurance, even with the ACA in place. And that is absolutely true.\n\nMcSally could have gone further to say that some people are paying more for their coverage now because their premiums went up and they don\u2019t qualify for the ACA\u2019s tax credits. McSally could even have mentioned that Arizona\u2019s private insurance markets have been among the most unstable in the country and that at one point it looked like parts of the state might have no carriers at all.\n\nBut the GOP repeal bill that McSally supported would have left even more people struggling to get insurance. That is because, in addition to undermining protections for people with pre-existing conditions, the proposal would have reallocated those tax credits for private insurance and dramatically cut funding for Medicaid.\n\nAll told, 23 million fewer people would have coverage if that bill had become law, according to an estimate by the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nThere are reasons a conservative like McSally might still think the bill made sense. Government spending \u2015 and the deficit \u2015 would have been lower. The government wouldn\u2019t have been setting so many rules about how health insurance should work.\n\nBut polls show that protections for pre-existing conditions, like many elements of the ACA, are popular \u2015 and that while voters don\u2019t love \u201cObamacare,\u201d they don\u2019t want to get rid of it either. They\u2019d rather make it better.\n\nThat sentiment is undoubtedly a big reason why GOP candidates like McSally are in trouble, even though she has been relatively popular and is running in a traditionally Republican state. Her opponent, Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, has attacked McSally repeatedly over that 2017 vote \u2015 and, as McSally recently admitted in a radio interview, \u201cI\u2019m getting my ass kicked\u201d over it."]
