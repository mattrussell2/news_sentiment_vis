["When Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum conceded Florida\u2019s gubernatorial race to his Republican opponent on election night, he was going off the best information he had at his disposal.\n\nQuite a bit has changed since then. The margin of victory between him and former Rep. Ron DeSantis has now narrowed to 0.41 percentage point, which is enough to trigger a statewide machine recount.\n\nNow Gillum is withdrawing his concession.\n\n\u201cLet me say clearly: I am replacing my words of concession with an uncompromised and unapologetic call that we count every single vote,\u201d Gillum said at a news conference Saturday. \u201cAnd I say this recognizing that my fate in this may or may not change.\u201d\n\nWhile concession speeches are not legally binding, they are a courteous gesture out of respect for the democratic process and the desire of the voters.\n\nBefore Gillum\u2019s briefing, Florida\u2019s Secretary of State Ken Detzner announced that the election results would be reviewed through an official recount. Florida law requires the secretary of state to call for a machine recount in races where unofficial results show a margin of 0.5 percentage point or less. If the machine recount shows a margin of 0.25 percentage points or less, the ballots will be recounted manually. (Manual recounts are done by hand and consider overvotes and undervotes rejected by the machine.)\n\nGillum also said that his team has organized at least 100 volunteers and lawyers, who will be spread out across the state to ensure a fair and accurate recount.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here because we want to make sure that the right that is guaranteed to all of us in our Constitution and certainly in our statutes is protected and that it is maintained,\u201d he said.\n\nAt least two other races will be subject to a recount, including the Senate race between Gov. Rick Scott (R) and the incumbent, Bill Nelson (D-Fla.). The margin of victory in that race has narrowed to 0.15 percentage point, meaning it will undergo a manual recount.\n\n\n\nAs the margin of victory closed in the Senate race, Scott alleged that \u201crampant fraud\u201d was present in the vote tallying. He called upon the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to investigate ballot counting practices in Broward and Palm Beach counties. He also claimed Brenda Snipes and Susan Bucher, the respective supervisors of elections for those counties, were attempting to \u201csteal\u201d the election from him.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t get the opportunity to stop counting votes because we don\u2019t like the direction in which the vote tally is headed,\u201d Gillum said Saturday. \u201cThat is not democratic and certainly is not the American way. In America, we count every vote regardless of what the outcome may be.\u201d\n\nRick Scott was up by 50,000+ votes on Election Day, now they \u201cfound\u201d many votes and he is only up 15,000 votes. \u201cThe Broward Effect.\u201d How come they never find Republican votes? \u2014 Donald J.

And while this is enough coincidence for some political observers to have feelings of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, there are several key differences, according to Barry Richard, who represented Republican candidate George W. Bush in the 2000 Florida recount and is now representing Gillum.\n\nIn 2000, the state\u2019s recount system was entirely candidate motivated, meaning there was no recount unless a candidate asked for one. Candidates also had the right to designate which counties would be required to recount their votes. Within days after the 2000 election, at least 47 lawsuits were filed, and the debacle dragged on for 36 days until the Supreme Court settled the election in Bush\u2019s favor over Democrat Al Gore.\n\n\u201cThis is not 2000.

He noticed that the bird had the physical attributes of the blue-winged warbler and golden-winged warbler, but sang like a third species, the chestnut-sided warbler. The bird piqued his interest enough that after taking photos and video, he contacted the Fuller Evolutionary Biology Lab at Cornell.\n\n\u201cI tried to make the email sound somewhat intellectual so they wouldn\u2019t think I was a crackpot,\u201d he said in the release.\n\nLuckily, the lab did not think Burket was a crackpot, and researcher David Toews soon got in touch with him. Together, they found the bird again and took a blood sample and measurements for ID purposes.\n\nAs it turned out, Burket\u2019s suspicion was right. DNA analysis showed that the bird\u2019s mother was a hybrid between golden-winged warbler and a blue-winged warbler, while the father was a chestnut-sided warbler. The results of the analysis were published this week in the science journal Biology Letters.\n\nCourtesy of the Cornell Lab of Ornithology.\n\nThe paper notes that the mix is especially significant because the bird\u2019s mother and father weren\u2019t just different species, but also different genera. Golden- and blue-winged warblers are both part of the Vermivora genus, while chestnut-sided warblers are part of the Setophaga genus.\n\nResearchers suspect this three-way hybridization ultimately happened in part because of declining numbers in the local population of golden-winged warblers, leaving females with fewer potential mates. In response, they may be \u201cmaking the best of a bad situation\u201d by selecting mates outside of their own species and genus, researchers wrote.\n\nLowell Burket The new hybrid before being sent back into the wild.\n\nAs for the rare new hybrid, he\u2019s hopefully enjoying some warmer weather at the moment.", "The United States is a relatively young country, historically.

As of Friday, however, Rouda led with 51.8 percent to 48.2 percent for the incumbent.\n\nRohrabacher, 71, had been accustomed to cruising to re-election in the affluent, conservative Orange County coastal sprawl south of Los Angeles. But Democrats made California\u2019s 48th Congressional District a key target in this year\u2019s midterm elections, focusing on Rohrabacher\u2019s ties to the Kremlin, his conspiratorial statements, and his closeness with President Donald Trump, who lost the district by 2 percentage points in 2016.\n\nRouda, 56, a wealthy real estate executive, was a registered Republican for decades and contributed to Ohio Gov.

However, many greyhounds can ultimately live in harmony with cats, so you\u2019ll need to assess your situation with the rescue group.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Greyhounds are known to give a lot of love to people.", "The death toll for California\u2019s wildfires more than doubled on Saturday as fire officials continued fighting to keep the widespread blaze contained.\n\nIn Northern California, where the Camp fire has incinerated more than 100,000 acres, including the town of Paradise, investigators discovered 14 more bodies trapped inside cars and homes, and outside.

The question now is whether that\u2019s about to change.\n\nThe day after a midterm election that saw President Trump losing ground in cities and suburbs while holding his own everywhere else, talk among Democrats has already turned to 2020.\n\n\u201cWhat did Tuesday say about how the Democrats can win back the White House?\u201d operatives and observers began to ask even before the last ballots were counted. \u201cAnd which candidates-in-waiting saw their stock rise as a result?\u201d\n\nSo far speculation has swirled around rising star Beto O\u2019Rourke, who came within 2.6 percentage points of unseating incumbent Republican Sen. Ted Cruz in ruby-red Texas.\n\nProgressives have pointed to red-state losses among centrist senators such as Claire McCaskill of Missouri, Joe Donnelly of Indiana and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota as evidence that moderation won\u2019t work two Novembers from now; centrists have pointed to red-state losses among progressive heroes such as O\u2019Rourke, Stacey Abrams of Georgia and Andrew Gillum of Florida to make the opposite argument.\n\nAnd the usual suspects \u2014 Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris \u2014 have been mentioned again and again.\n\nFew, however, have been mentioning Brown. That\u2019s probably a mistake.\n\n\u201c[Brown] has a reservoir of wisdom the Dems could draw from,\u201d former Virginia Rep. Tom Perriello declared Tuesday on Twitter.\n\nOf all the Democrats who could plausibly play a part in the looming drama of the next presidential campaign, the raspy, rumpled populist emerged from Election Day with by far the most to brag about.\n\nLike his fellow Rust Belt Democrats \u2014 Sens. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin and Bob Casey of Pennsylvania \u2014 Brown cruised to reelection in a state that broke for Trump in 2016.\n\nUnlike Stabenow, Baldwin or Casey, however, Brown managed to win in a state that backed Trump by 8 percent two years ago \u2014 not less than 1 percent, like the others \u2014 and where Republicans swept all of 2018\u2019s other competitive contests, from governor on down.\n\nYahoo News Supporters of Sen. Sherrod Brown celebrate his victory on Nov. 6, 2018, in Columbus.\n\nIn fact, Brown received 280,000 more votes than his party\u2019s gubernatorial candidate, Richard Cordray, and 100,000 more than Cordray\u2019s victorious Republican rival, Mike DeWine. Brown actually won by a larger margin Tuesday than in 2012, when Barack Obama was on the ballot to boost Democratic turnout. And the gap between his victory this year and Trump\u2019s in 2016 \u2014 a swing of 14.5 percentage points \u2014 was wider than all but Jon Tester\u2019s in Montana and Joe Manchin\u2019s in West Virginia.\n\nThe kicker is that while Tester and Manchin ran as moderates, and while Casey, Stabenow and Baldwin tend to legislate from the center-left, Brown has compiled one of the most liberal voting records in the Senate \u2014 a record on which he proudly campaigned. According to the data journalists at FiveThirtyEight, Brown votes with Trump only 28.2 percent of the time \u2014 roughly 41 percent less often than you would expect based on how strongly Ohio supported Trump in 2016. That\u2019s the second-largest \u201cTrump-minus\u201d score in the entire Senate.\n\nFor Brown, defying the odds is nothing new. As a 2017 BuzzFeed profile put it, the senator has \u201ccombined a fierce populism and unapologetic progressive ideals to repeatedly win local and state elections \u2014 even as Ohio has trended increasingly conservative.\u201d He\u2019s won in cities and rural communities, old manufacturing hubs and college towns, diverse districts and mostly white districts.\n\nAnd now he\u2019s won 10 times in row.\n\nFirst elected to the House in 1992, Brown secured reelection two years later by picking off Republican-leaning workers who\u2019d previously backed Ross Perot\u2019s anti-NAFTA presidential bid. In 2012, running for a second Senate term, he earned 95 percent of the black vote and outperformed his GOP rival, state Treasurer Josh Mandel, in many white, industrial parts of the state \u2014 including Mahoning and Trumbull counties, where Brown took 66 percent and 62 percent of the vote respectively. On Tuesday, Brown again won both counties by 15- to 20-point margins.\n\nGetty Images Brown shakes hands with workers as they leave the Ford Engine Plant in 2006 in Brook Park, Ohio.\n\nAs Yahoo News has previously reported, Brown didn\u2019t accomplish this by moderating his staunchly liberal views on social and cultural issues. He was one of only two members of Ohio\u2019s congressional delegation to vote against the Defense of Marriage Act in 1996; he\u2019s pro-LGBTQ, pro-abortion rights, pro-gun control, and pro-criminal justice reform. (He was the first senator to oppose Jeff Sessions\u2019s nomination as attorney general.)\n\nInstead, Brown keeps winning in Ohio because he has spent his entire career obsessing, first and foremost, over the concerns of workers.\n\nNot just white workers, the way Trump did in 2016. All workers.\n\n\u201cI do my very best to fight for working people in this job,\u201d Brown told Yahoo News last year. \u201cAnd that means all workers \u2014 whether you punch a time sheet or swipe a badge, make a salary or earn tips. Whether you\u2019re on payroll, a contract worker or a temp \u2014 working behind a desk, on a factory floor or behind a restaurant counter. The fact is, all workers across this country are feeling squeezed.\u201d\n\nOther, higher-profile Senate populists \u2014 Sanders and Warren \u2014 tend to view the world through an anti-Wall Street lens. Brown sees everything from a pro-worker perspective. To the casual listener, Sanders and Warren can sound as if they\u2019re bashing billionaires or bankers because they\u2019re billionaires or bankers \u2014 a message that might resonate in liberal enclaves like Vermont or Massachusetts but doesn\u2019t play as well in middle America.\n\nIn contrast, Brown is always careful to remind voters that the real problem isn\u2019t corporate profits per se \u2014 it\u2019s that \u201cworkers are no longer sharing in the wealth they help create.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith Sherrod, the message works because of the messenger,\u201d Perriello explains. \u201cHe has never wavered in standing up to power brokers in D.C. \u2014 and even in his own party \u2014 to fight for families, workers and consumers. He can sell it because people buy that he means it, that he is fighting for us.\u201d\n\nFor 18 years, Brown refused to enroll in a congressional health plan, saying he would not accept federally subsidized care until the American public could also avail itself of the same option. As a state representative in the mid-1970s, he spent long days listening to tales of worry and woe at the steelworkers\u2019 union hall in his hometown of Mansfield, Ohio. He went on to lead the bipartisan opposition to NAFTA, crossing then-President Bill Clinton; more than two decades later, he helped torpedo the Trans-Pacific Partnership, defying Barack Obama. In between, Brown wrote a book called Myths of Free Trade. On election night 2016, he surprised his gloomy staffers by immediately offering to help Trump renegotiate NAFTA (a promise he\u2019s kept). And when Brown rescued a shaggy black dog, he named it Franklin \u2014 as in Roosevelt, the Democrat who created the New Deal.\n\nAFP Brown looks on as Teamsters Union President James P. Hoffa voices his opposition to Mexican trucks entering the U.S. under the NAFTA deal, in Washington, D.C., in 2001.\n\nWhen asked about a possible White House bid, the senator tends to dismiss the notion with lukewarm responses such as \u201cI don\u2019t like the idea of running for president\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t \u2026 have any real interest in that\u201d \u2014 though he also admits he hasn\u2019t ruled it out.\n\n\u201cI hear it more and more,\u201d Brown conceded in a September interview with the Cincinnati Enquirer. \u201cI think about it from time to time.\u201d\n\nIn truth, Brown seems much more excited about the idea that his strategy could serve as a road map for some other 2020 candidate. \u201cI hope the message that I win with \u2014 the dignity of work and whose side are you on \u2014 gets into the national debate,\u201d he recently told CNBC. \u201cBecause plenty of my colleagues want to be president a lot more than I do.\u201d\n\nTo that end, Brown has released a suite of populist policy proposals that would strengthen key labor standards to reflect an economy that increasingly relies on alternative work arrangements (temps, subcontractors, freelancers, and such). He wouldn\u2019t just raise the minimum wage and require paid sick days and paid family leave. He would also expand collective bargaining rights. He would ensure that alternative workers get benefits too. And he would crack down on employers that force people to work off the clock, refuse to pay the minimum wage, deny overtime pay, take tips, or knowingly misclassify workers to avoid paying fair wages.\n\nFinally \u2014 and perhaps most potently \u2014 Brown would implement what he calls a \u201ccarrot and stick\u201d approach to big companies that slash labor costs to pad their profits.\n\n\u201cRepublicans are going to cut taxes on the largest corporations and the wealthiest people in the country,\u201d the senator has explained. \u201cI think \u2026 those companies that pay a living wage and provide health benefits and retirement benefits and don\u2019t outsource their jobs, they should get a lower tax rate. But the companies that pay $10 or $11 [an hour] so that their employees get food stamps and Medicaid and Section 8 housing vouchers? Those companies should pay a Corporate Freeloader Fee, because taxpayers have to subsidize those corporations\u2019 wages.\u201d\n\nBrown\u2019s plan is probably too bold to become law anytime soon \u2014 but as a declaration of intent aimed directly at blue-collar Americans, it couldn\u2019t be clearer. \u201cBecause he gets how much families are struggling, Sherrod knows that you make smart solutions more appealing not by cutting the idea in half but by doubling it,\u201d Perriello says. \u201cWhile Beltway pundits try to label ideas on a mythical left-right spectrum, people in Ohio and around the country care only about where it fits in terms of making a difference at the kitchen table.\u201d\n\nYahoo News Brown, surrounded by members of his family, speaks in Columbus after his campaign victory.\n\nWho knows whether voters outside of Ohio will ever hear a message like Brown\u2019s. It\u2019s possible, even probable, that Democrats will continue to shy away from so-called class warfare and resist even a progressive concept of class identity \u2014 a concept that sees class not as a way to turn white workers against the rest of the electorate, as Trump has done, but rather as a way to unite all working-class Americans, regardless of their other identities, around a set of reforms that might help them withstand a 21st-century economy that has rapidly and ruthlessly turned against them: black or white, gay or straight, blue-collar or white-collar.\n\nBut if 2018\u2019s divided results demonstrated anything, it\u2019s that, going forward, such an approach may be the surest way for Democrats to succeed again in states like Ohio that have been trending red; to stymie Trump in purple states like Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania; and perhaps to win back the White House.\n\n\u201cLet our country \u2014 our nation\u2019s citizens, our Democratic Party, my fellow elected officials all over the country \u2014 let them all cast their eyes toward the heartland, to the industrial Midwest, to our Great Lakes state,\u201d Brown said in his victory speech Tuesday night. \u201cYou showed the country that progressives can win \u2014 and win decisively \u2014 in the heartland, [and] that by putting people first and by honoring the dignity of work, we can carry a state Donald Trump won by nearly 10 points.\u201d\n\nLest anyone missed the point, Brown went on to contrast his kind of populism with Trump\u2019s \u2014 and to link his winning campaign to the coming presidential election.\n\n\u201cPopulists are not racists,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do not appeal to some by pushing down others. We do not lie. We do not engage in hate speech. And we do not rip babies from their families at the border. \u2026 We will never ever give up the hallowed ground of patriotism to the extremists \u2014 at the statehouse and in the White House.\n\n\u201cThat is the message coming out of Ohio in 2018,\u201d he concluded. \u201cAnd that is the blueprint for our nation in 2020.\u201d\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the reluctant Brown will challenge Trump in two years\u2019 time; his decision will probably depend on whether another Democrat is willing to pick up the pro-worker baton.\n\nAnd even if he does run, it\u2019s unclear that his gruff, earnest, understated style would translate to a national stage where Trumpian brashness and bombast have increasingly become the norm.\n\nStill, for anyone trying to find a 2020 message in the aftermath of 2018, Brown\u2019s may have been the clearest signal amid a lot of noise.\n\n_____", "The \u201cSwish Swish\u201d singer hit back at Trump on Saturday after he tweeted from Paris that \u201cgross mismanagement of the forests\u201d by state authorities were to blame for the three huge fires that have killed at least nine people and forced the evacuation of thousands more.", "As the administration of President Donald Trump continues its crackdown on undocumented people across the country, a dedicated group of legal organizations has mobilized to help impoverished migrants facing detention, deportation or family separations.\n\nBarbara Pe\u00f1a, 45, is at the forefront of the movement working in opposition to Trump\u2019s immigration policies. \u201cThe workload can be intense,\u201d she explains. \u201cSixty-hour work weeks are not uncommon.\u201d\n\nPe\u00f1a is the education and outreach director for the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services (RAICES), a Texas-based nonprofit that offers low-cost legal services mainly to people who fled poverty or instability in Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and southern Mexico.\n\nRAICES is best known for a viral fundraising campaign that brought the organization more than $20 million in donations over the summer, propelled by public shock over the news that the Trump administration\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d immigration policy had separated more than 2,000 children from their families.\n\nJohn Moore via Getty Images\n\nPe\u00f1a, who is Mexican-American, spends much of her time helping RAICES lawyers interact with undocumented families, migrants detained crossing the U.S. border, and people trying to reconnect with relatives or children who have been placed in detention centers. She also visits communities that are vulnerable to raids by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and distributes information about undocumented people\u2019s legal rights and how to prepare a family when a relative is set to be deported.\n\n\u201cIt can be very difficult to see the pain in people\u2019s faces and the panic,\u201d Pe\u00f1a said. \u201cUnless you are facing the threat of deportation, you don\u2019t understand that kind of terror.\u201d\n\nAugust saw a massive ICE presence in Sumner, Texas, where agents arrested 159 people at a trailer manufacturing company. RAICES offered legal services to 170 people as a result of the raid and helped pay bond for 20 or so detainees, according to NBC.\n\nPe\u00f1a sat down with HuffPost to explain what it\u2019s like working to connect undocumented people with legal representation and shared some of the biggest challenges she and her colleagues face.\n\nHow did you first get involved with RAICES?\n\nI joined RAICES in March of 2017, but I volunteered the previous December when ICE released over 450 asylum-seeking families from detention, stranding them at the San Antonio bus station, many without tickets for forward travel or even the means to contact their family members or sponsors who were receiving them in the United States. The RAICES emergency shelter was overflowing. Allied shelters were beyond capacity. The entire city was overwhelmed, and ICE could not or would not say why these families were released en masse.\n\nSeeing these families, all of whom were fleeing terror, corruption and violence in their home countries, with no way to move forward, made a huge impression on me. That was my wake-up call.\n\nIt\u2019s really powerful and moving to understand the resiliency and the courage these families have to make a trip like that, knowing that there is the possibility they may not be granted asylum, they may be returned back to their home country. They are still willing to undertake such incredible risks to keep their family safe \u2015 it really touched me.\n\nHow did you feel when the family separations were revealed earlier this year?\n\nMy first thought was for the mental health of these children. The terror of being ripped away from their mothers and fathers is unimaginable. How is a 4-year-old child supposed to process that? How is that child ever going to feel safe again?\n\nIt\u2019s difficult for most people to understand that RAICES represents children who would otherwise appear alone in immigration court. Can you imagine a child going up against the full weight of the U.S. government without access to counsel? Yet it happens regularly. We are here to shine a light on this broken immigration system.\n\nWhat is the biggest challenge you currently face in your job?\n\nAdequately explaining to the public how dire the situation is. Every single day, we have attorneys, social workers and legal assistants going into detention centers and making sure that vulnerable immigrant populations have access to due process, legal counsel. We want to make sure our staff has access to the centers, that they are getting in, that they are able to work with these families and prepare them for their next legal steps. Unless they have access to pro-bono services, they are lost in this sea of immigration proceedings.\n\nWe are here to shine a light on this broken immigration system. Barbara Pe\u00f1a, Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services\n\nAnd you have to remember that there is a language barrier. So even if they have access to an interpreter, the interpreter may not understand their accents or may speak too quickly \u2015 there is always the possibility of miscommunication. There are a very high number of families who come from southern Mexico and Guatemala who are indigenous accent speakers, and there are very often no interpreters available for those families.\n\nWhat are some other roadblocks that hinder the work you\u2019re doing in this political climate, which is so openly hostile to immigrants?\n\nHere in the United States, we do ourselves such disservice by not having an interest in the immigration debate until it impacts us on the southern border. We fail to understand the root of the problem. There is a lack of information about the country conditions that are driving these families to come here seeking asylum in the first place.\n\nIf you look at a place like El Salvador, not much has changed in the last 30 years. There is still crushing poverty, incredible rates of intrafamilial violence. Many of the women and girls we see are fleeing homicidal domestic violence. There is third- and fourth-generation gang violence in a place where there is very little governmental infrastructure, and gangs have completely overrun some neighborhoods. Your average American doesn\u2019t really understand what that kind of violence looks like.\n\nAny success stories that have made you glad to do what you do for a living?\n\nThe highlight of my summer was helping one of our clients board her flight to join her family in another part of the country. She and her daughter had been separated under \u201czero tolerance,\u201d and through the diligent work of our attorneys, they were reunited. I will never forget the look of hope on her face as she and her daughter received their boarding passes. Even something as simple as being able to sit together on the flight to their new home was very meaningful for them. It made me want to work harder on behalf of those families who have yet to be reunited.\n\nEarlier this year, RAICES said it would help reunite migrant families separated under \u201czero tolerance\u201d by using the $20 million from a viral fundraising campaign. How has your organization put that money to use so far?", "OLIVE BRANCH, Miss. (AP) \u2014 A hospital in Tennessee has fired a worker who was photographed wearing a racist shirt while voting in Mississippi.\n\nNews outlets report that Regional One Health in Memphis says its investigation into the image shared online led to the man being fired. A picture of the man shows him at a polling place wearing a shirt that has a Confederate flag with a noose in the center and the words \u201cMississippi Justice.\u201d\n\nThe hospital\u2019s statement didn\u2019t identify the man, but he has been identified online as a registered nurse, Clayton John Hickey.", "An incredibly diverse group of women will show up for work in Congress next year. Native American women, Muslim women, African-American women, mothers and child-free women, young and old women all won elections this week.\n\nBut in one regard these women will be remarkably homogeneous: They\u2019re mostly Democrats.\n\nThere are still a few contests that haven\u2019t been decided, but as of this writing, a record 123 women will be heading to Congress for the next term. Only 19 of them are Republicans \u2015 down from 23.\n\nIn other words, while the Democratic Party in Congress edges closer to something like gender parity \u2015 nearly 40 percent of the House Democratic caucus will be female \u2015 the GOP is bleeding female politicians.\n\nCertainly, it is the year of the woman, but with an asterisk. Jennifer Lawless, professor of politics at the University of Virginia\n\nRepublicans have shown diminishing interest in putting up women in elections. During the 2018 cycle, female Republican candidates had a hard time getting funding, Jennifer Pierotti Lim, co-founder of Republican Women for Progress, told HuffPost recently.\n\n\u201cThe RNC has long purported to support getting more women into office, but they don\u2019t do anything,\u201d said Lim, who added that a lot of the GOP women running in primaries this year couldn\u2019t get enough funding from the party. \u201cSo nobody takes them seriously.\u201d\n\nWhat this means going forward is that women\u2019s electoral successes are linked to the vagaries of the political environment, said Jennifer Lawless, a professor of politics at the University of Virginia.\n\n\u201cCertainly, it is the year of the woman, but with an asterisk,\u201d she said.\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising, of course, that the party of a president notorious for misogyny and accused of sexual misconduct is edging ever closer toward pure patriarchy. But it\u2019s important to clarify that the Republican Party\u2019s affinity for electing men \u2015 and its male perspective \u2015 is a problem for everyone.\n\nThe GOP\u2019s aversion to women is holding back what looks like real movement toward gender equality in Congress, i.e., a truly representative body that looks like the rest of the U.S., where slightly more than half the population is female.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not gonna get to 50 percent women if only one party gets to 50 percent women,\u201d said Deborah Walsh, the director of Rutgers\u2019 Center for American Women and Politics. \u201cWork has to get done on the Republican side to get to the point where we see parity.\u201d\n\nPool via Getty Images Republicans in Congress, dominated by men, haven\u2019t been as willing to clean house when it comes to issues like sexual misconduct.\n\nFemale candidates win at the same rates as their male peers, Walsh said. This holds for both parties. On Tuesday, for example, Tennessee elected its first female senator, Republican Marsha Blackburn, a Trump-supporting conservative woman.\n\nThe effects of this lopsided gender configuration extend beyond the demographics of the legislature. If women are mostly confined to one party, then stereotypes about women are going to be harder to dislodge and the concerns of the women of this country will increasingly be viewed through a partisan lens.\n\nThe Me Too movement started out largely apolitical when confined to Hollywood moguls \u2015 but then turned rabidly partisan when politicians started getting accused of misconduct.\n\nAnd the way the two parties handled accusations had a lot to do with their gender composition.\n\nDemocrats in the Senate, largely led by Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), ousted their colleague Al Franken over sexual misconduct. Gillibrand received pushback, to be sure, but her colleagues ultimately followed her lead.\n\nRepublicans in Congress, dominated by men, haven\u2019t been as willing to clean house. Indeed, they overwhelmingly rushed to defend and push through the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh, even as he was facing credible accusations of misconduct.\n\nNotably, the only Republican to defect on Kavanaugh was one of the party\u2019s few female senators. Would a Republican Party with more female politicians have behaved similarly?\n\nIf women are mostly confined to one party, then stereotypes about women are going to be harder to dislodge and the concerns of the women of this country will increasingly be viewed through a partisan lens.\n\nThere\u2019s a perception that women are a minority voting bloc with a common interest. But as a group, they\u2019re actually just like men: Some lean conservative, some don\u2019t. That\u2019s a lesson that should have been made extra-clear after white women helped propel Trump to the White House in 2016, and also broke for the GOP on Tuesday.\n\nBy confining women and their interests to one party, there is a risk of turning certain issues \u2015 like health care, or paid leave, or equal pay \u2015 into partisan concerns. Consequently, women become excluded from crucial conversations: Remember that all-male Republican group convened to decide the fate of reproductive health care early on in the Trump administration?\n\n\u201cIt further politicizes the kinds of issues that matter to the women who were elected,\u201d said Lawless. \u201cThose issues that disproportionately affect women are now going to be seen even more as Democratic issues.\u201d\n\nYet there\u2019s wider consensus nationwide on many of these matters. For example, an overwhelming majority of Americans support paid leave.", "On Wednesday, I was on no fewer than three group texts between white women asking what they could do about white women.\n\nIt was the day after the midterm elections, and the exit poll numbers showed, once again, that more than half of white women voters voted Republican in key races in Florida and Texas, and that more than three-quarters of white women voters had voted against gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams in Georgia.\n\nDespite the historic gains made by women this week \u2015 Americans will be sending more than 100 women to Congress, many of them young women of color \u2015 a familiar fact reasserted itself. As Elie Mystal put it on Twitter: \u201cWhite women gonna white.\u201d\n\nWhite women:\n\n76% Kemp\n\n59% Cruz\n\n51% DeSantis\n\n\n\nBlack women:\n\n95% O'Rourke\n\n97% Abrahms\n\n82% Gillum\n\n\n\nWhite women gonna white. \u2014 Elie Mystal (@ElieNYC) November 7, 2018\n\nMy texting friends wanted to understand what they could do to call their fellow white women in, to check them on their alliance with the forces of white (and male) supremacy. I saw a slew of posts on Instagram from progressive women calling on white women to do better, to come for each other, to step up and take responsibility for their sisters.\n\nIt makes sense to group white women together and look at their voting patterns. Those patterns are real and have a real effect on elections. They also tell white people something that people of color have always known: White women prop up and benefit from white supremacy just as white men do. They (we) are and have historically been, as Rebecca Traister wrote, some of \u201cwhite patriarchy\u2019s most eager foot soldiers.\u201d And even within so-called liberal enclaves, racism remains a powerful force, one that \u201cnice white ladies\u201d abet if they\u2019re not actively challenging it.\n\nBut on a practical level, broad calls for white women to come for white women can flatten the reality of just how divided white women are from each other. Yes, white women as a whole tend to vote Republican, but dig into the data and deep schisms based on religion, region, marital status, education and age become apparent. For example, white women as an aggregate voted Republican and have for years, but college-educated white women did not.\n\nSo, where do we \u2015 \u201cwe\u201d being white women who want to do effective, anti-racist political work \u2015 go from here? I reached out to Corinne McConnaughy, a political science professor at George Washington University and author, whose work focuses on the roles gender and race play in shaping American politics and institutions. She was blunt with me in stating that women as a whole and white women specifically are not cohesive political blocs, and likely will never be. She also encouraged white women on the left to focus their energies where they are most useful: mobilizing within their subgroups and calling in the sympathetic but less than active white men in their lives. Below is our conversation, lightly edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nIn your work, you talk a lot about the way that women are not actually a unified political bloc. I\u2019m wondering how we saw that thesis play out during the midterm elections?\n\nI think the thing that\u2019s going to be hard for people to hold together is that we can have a significant gender gap [in voting for Republicans versus Democrats], and we can have these new historic wins for women candidates and at the same time the overarching story can be that most women are voting [based on factors] other than, \u201cI have a common interest with other women.\u201d\n\nThe key is understanding that the [gender] gap, though it\u2019s statistically large enough to swing some elections, is still pretty small. We\u2019re talking about a couple of percentage points of difference between aggregated men\u2019s voting behavior and aggregated women\u2019s voting behavior.\n\nBut that\u2019s the key. It\u2019s not that 80 percent of women behave a certain way. They don\u2019t. It\u2019s that a subset of women have had a gendered reason to make a particular voting decision, and they\u2019re rightly positioned to swing some elections and create an aggregate noticeable gap. So instead of thinking, \u201cWhat do women voters do?\u201d think instead, \u201cWhich women made different decisions than their male counterparts?\u201d\n\nAre there any groups of women we saw break from their male counterparts this week?\n\nCollege-educated white women, particularly in the suburbs, are making noticeably different decisions than their male counterparts [and voting more Democratic]. Black women are the most Democratic voting group. They are different than their black male counterparts, who are more likely than black women to vote Republican. But there\u2019s no reason to think, and there\u2019s no evidence to suggest, that those black women and those white, college-educated, suburban women are behaving differently than their male counterparts for the same reason. Black women are the glue holding together the black community. The civil rights movement was built on their backs, so I think that\u2019s a long-standing pattern, and that\u2019s different than the reason that the educated, white women in the suburbs are suddenly voting more for Democrats.\n\nThe key is that where white women have been able to hold other white women accountable has been inside of some other grouping where their commonality is defined not just by being white women. Corinne McConnaughy, political science professor at George Washington University\n\nSo is it just not useful for us to speak about women as a political group at all?\n\nThat\u2019s the hill I\u2019m going to die on. We don\u2019t talk about men as a [cohesive political] group. We do with men voters what we should be doing with women voters, which is we talk about specific segments of the electorate that are male that are doing a particular political thing because of the way that gender incentive is working out in that particular space. We should talk about kinds of women voters, and we should talk about when we think gender is providing a reason for behavior that is splitting voters who should for other reasons be behaving the same way.\n\nWhen politicians invoke women as a monolith, what are they trying to do?\n\nIt\u2019s this really handy tool in doing politics that everybody gets to say \u201cwomen,\u201d right? What happens is that if they\u2019ve got the message right, then a set of women hear it as, \u201cOh, this is about me.\u201d\n\nWomanhood and manhood are such intimately derived identities that we use these big categorical terms. All of us do it, when we know full well we don\u2019t mean all of the group, but we do it because using that big categorical term and then filling in the content that we claim goes with it is resonant among the subset [we\u2019re a part of]. This is the \u201cOh, gosh, of course women are concerned about unequal pay in the workplace.\u201d Well, no, not all of them are, actually, but the ones who are hear their interests as definitional of the category. That\u2019s empowering. \u201cAh, yeah, that\u2019s what it means to be a woman.\u201d\n\nThis goes all the way back, like the Declaration of Sentiments, which is [considered a] foundational document for the suffrage movement. My students are required to read it very carefully every semester because it\u2019s supposed to be this document documenting the horrible things that men have done to women, the same way the Declaration of Independence [recorded] what the king did to the Colonists. Well, you read it and it\u2019s a bunch of privileged white women\u2019s concerns.\n\nSo, I\u2019d assume that invoking \u201cwomen\u201d as one group can also be an effective organizing tool.\n\nIt can be useful to use the term. But know using the term is about mobilizing a specific segment [of women]. And don\u2019t expect that what you\u2019re up to is going to create some sort of bloc of women in politics. We are half the population. We are not all anywhere near socially interconnected. Which is usually different from racial and ethnic minority groups. It makes a lot of sense to talk about black voters and to talk about making appeals to black voters as a group because there\u2019s enough social interdependence defined by blackness. Women aren\u2019t a social group.\n\nWould you consider white women to be a cohesive social group?\n\nNo. I am always looking for spaces that are social groups where there is potential for women and men in those spaces to be diverging in exactly how they are navigating that other identity. Like white evangelicals, that\u2019s a [social] group. They are tied together by a religious structure. There [are] leaders, there\u2019s a real sense that this is a community. Women aren\u2019t a community. So you might look at white evangelicals and say, gosh, what happens if women start to define the experience of being a white evangelical differently? There are some young evangelical women pushing hard to try to make that happen.\n\nOne of the reasons I\u2019m really interested in talking to you about white womanhood is because on the left, especially since 2016 when exit poll data showed that 52 percent of white women voters voted for Donald Trump, there have been increasingly loud calls for white women to come for our own.\n\nBut how?\n\nWell, I guess that\u2019s a question I have for you.\n\nWhat are the social mechanisms? Like, what are the levers [for white women] to pull over each other? Part of the uniqueness of black women\u2019s lived experience [in this country] is that there is truly a social interdependence, black people letting each other know, like, \u201cI have my eyes on you, and it matters that you make the right choice \u2015 the choice that is the anti-white supremacy choice.\u201d That that has weight. But what\u2019s my lever over other white women? What\u2019s tying us all together? How am I able to sanction them? There isn\u2019t a sense of common stakes [between white women as a whole group]. And I think part of the thing is, there\u2019s a continuum here, of how much group-ness there is. I think it\u2019s more likely that we can see episodic changes in behavior.\n\nMy work on the suffrage movement was looking at how [it gained] enough leverage to do the costly politics that it takes. It involved women who were organized inside their social groupings. For example, women in labor unions. Members of labor unions are beholden to each other in really important ways. They have a common leadership, they have a sanctioning structure. So I think that\u2019s where we look for what leverage we can have. I think if we are learning anything from the Trump era, it\u2019s that people have to care about the sanctions for violating the norms. And if they don\u2019t care about the sanctions or the norms, then it doesn\u2019t matter that you\u2019re trying to point out that they didn\u2019t adhere to the norm.\n\nWe keep asking white women to get other white women. Why are we not asking white women who are sympathetic to the left to come for those marginally sympathetic, tied-to-them-socially white men? Corinne McConnaughy\n\nFrom an activist and political organizing perspective, is the answer just to throw your hands in the air and say white women can\u2019t come for other white women?\n\nI think the key is that where white women have been able to hold other white women accountable has been inside of some other grouping where their commonality is defined not just by being white women. Teachers\u2019 unions are a good example. Women can say, \u201cLook, here\u2019s our common interest,\u201d and use that space where there\u2019s an understanding of common interest and connection.\n\nSo are you saying that it\u2019s less politically useful to say, \u201cWhite women come for white women\u201d than it is to say, \u201cwhite evangelical women, reckon with your community,\u201d or, \u201cwhite Jewish women, reckon with your community\u201d?\n\nRight, and then to give a specific narrative that makes sense inside of those communities. I think there are some white, evangelical women who are articulating exactly that, who are saying, \u201cNo, this evangelical community is leaving these Christian principles aside, and that\u2019s not who we are.\u201d And maybe they are particularly noticing that because of their gendered experience of being subordinated in that space. That can matter.\n\nRight. Womanhood matters within these subgroups, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily tie all women to each other. Which I think can be really frustrating.\n\nBut the beauty of that is that these women in those spaces also can create agency over men in those spaces, right? What some white evangelical women are looking to do is not to just say, \u201cHey, white evangelical women, we should disagree.\u201d But: \u201cAs white evangelical women, we should be redefining the whole space. We should be demanding different things from our church. From our church leaders. From our membership.\u201d So again, their gender experience may be leading them to articulate these things, but in the end they often can move, not just the women in those spaces, but some of the men, too.\n\nWe got women\u2019s suffrage because labor unions and farmers\u2019 organizations finally signed on for the cause. They did that because of their women members, but the entire organizations signed on. Not just the women in them. And that\u2019s what pushed the politics in this progressive women\u2019s right direction [at that time].\n\nI know it\u2019s hard. I have so much empathy for trying to write this up as a journalist. This is really the core of my entire gender and politics class.\n\n[Laughs.] Well, it\u2019s hard to write about as a journalist and also hard to grapple with personally. I\u2019m a white woman who truthfully doesn\u2019t really have meaningful social ties to other white women who vote super differently from me. I\u2019m Jewish, college-educated, grew up just outside an urban center and now live in an urban center. So how is the energy of someone like me best used?\n\nMaybe it\u2019s more important to have white women on the left to demand things of the people that they actually have leverage over. We keep asking white women to get other white women. Why are we not asking white women who are sympathetic to the left to come for those marginally sympathetic, tied-to-them-socially white men? It\u2019s not about saying that white women who are on the left don\u2019t have the obligation to do some work. It\u2019s just not clear to me why the expected work that they would do would be to go get other white women [to whom they have no social ties]. It would be to identify \u201cWho are your gettable white men?\u201d And get them.\n\nWhat you could do is be like, \u201cI\u2019m going to put effort into making sure that my Jewish community is really an active partner,\u201d but you can say: \u201cI feel this obligation, because those other white women are letting us down. I feel the obligation, but I\u2019m not going to fulfill it by going after them. I\u2019m going to fulfill it in a different way, in a more effective way.\u201d The history of progressive change in terms of civil rights is not about getting all the white people on board. But it is about trying to get the should-be-sympathetic-but-maybe-aren\u2019t-active groups of white folks actively on board. And, it turns out, that\u2019s what matters. That\u2019s what delivers the political goods. It\u2019s what delivers elections, too. You\u2019ve got to mobilize, and we do that through groups.", "Television\u2019s great movie-star migration is old news \u2015 until now. \u201cHomecoming,\u201d the twisty series that dropped last week on Amazon, doesn\u2019t have some plain ol\u2019 A-lister clawing at the boob tube\u2019s door. We\u2019re talking about the one and only Julia Roberts, the woman who defined a generation of Hollywood and endured the \u201cAmerica\u2019s sweetheart\u201d branding that makes her latest role all the more fascinating. Streaming shows come and go, but Julia is forever.\n\n\u201cHomecoming\u201d has been buzzy right out the gate, partly because of its lead actress and partly because it\u2019s an addictive mystery whose half-hour installments adhere perfectly to the tenets of bingeability. Adapted from Eli Horowitz and Micah Bloomberg\u2019s fiction podcast of the same name, the series revolves around Heidi Bergman (Roberts), a social worker employed at a shadowy facility that claims to rehabilitate discharged soldiers. Over 10 episodes that fixate largely on her relationship with one key patient (Stephan James), we learn that Heidi\u2019s work isn\u2019t as straightforward or noble as it might seem.\n\nTwo HuffPost writers, Matthew Jacobs and Maxwell Strachan, blew through \u201cHomecoming\u201d in quick sittings. Does it live up to the hype? Time to discuss. (Note: We delve into the show\u2019s ending in vague terms, so proceed with caution if you don\u2019t want to know anything at all.\n\nMatthew Jacobs: Maxwell, as of this morning, you\u2019d finished half of \u201cHomecoming.\u201d Then I insisted you finish so we could discuss. Since it\u2019s fresh on your mind, what\u2019s your impression? Can\u2019t stop thinking of Heidi\u2019s fish tank, I bet.\n\nMaxwell Strachan: What is going on with that fish tank! One of many metaphors in this show I feel like I only half-understood at best. I knew nothing about this show going in, except that Julia Roberts was the star. And honestly, I wasn\u2019t expecting all that much. I didn\u2019t really like the name of the show, which didn\u2019t exactly pull me in. But wow, I have to say, I loved it. The combination of romance and semi-realistic sci-fi seemed like it would be a disaster, and for a little while I was worried it would be. But by the final scene, I found myself transfixed and emotional \u2015 maybe because I also found Julia Roberts and Stephan James so captivating. Did it work for you? It does kind of have that \u201cfemale journalist falls in love with her subject\u201d storyline, replacing a master\u2019s degree in journalism with one in social work.\n\nAmazon Studios\n\nMJ: For a minute there, it did get hard to tell whether Julia and Stephan were on the cusp of lunging for each other\u2019s lips. Thankfully the show never goes there \u2015 one of the many, many things I adore about it. You\u2019re not wrong about the title, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve been so effusive about anything on TV this year. The minute the flash-forward hit in that first episode, I was hooked. Julia looked weathered in a way that we\u2019ve rarely seen, and I immediately needed to know what was making those skies so gray (metaphorically but also literally \u2015 it\u2019s a very gray show). When did you fall in love?\n\nMS: I\u2019m a sucker for anything \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d-esque, by which I mean science-fiction storylines that could theoretically come to pass in the real world, so I was interested almost from the second I realized someone from the Department of Defense was snooping around about a sketchy government-affiliated entity. But the moment I went from interested to hooked probably came at the beginning of Episode 2, when the camera zoomed so far in on those canned pineapples dumped on Shrier\u2019s plate. It was so, I don\u2019t know, weird? Especially when combined with the fantastically creepy accompanying music. This show almost forces you to focus on those little details \u2015 the pineapples, the harmonica, the off-kilter pens and aforementioned fish tank. Which of those sorts of things stuck with you most?\n\nMJ: Maybe it was the split-screen walk-and-talks, during which Heidi\u2019s boss (Bobby Cannavale) would bark orders into his Bluetooth headset \u2015 a great excuse to put two close-ups side by side, underscoring Heidi\u2019s befuddlement and Colin\u2019s desperate need to dominate. I also loved the layered staircase that the Department of Defense investigator marches down at the start of Episode 3, when the camera glides downward like something out of \u201cVertigo.\u201d God bless a half-hour drama, where long takes like that don\u2019t feel indulgent.\n\nThe reveal I loved the most came from Walter\u2019s mom (the wonderful Marianne Jean-Baptiste), who discovered that her son\u2019s post-military care was in the hands of the company responsible for manufacturing the cleaning products in her house. Suddenly a labyrinth of corporate greed, phony philanthropy and aching human drama came rushing to the fore. But neither that nor the pineapples could prepare me for the show\u2019s biggest twist: how Heidi\u2019s memory was wiped. I\u2019m terrible at predicting the outcome of anything, but I wasn\u2019t expecting ... that.\n\nMS: The show definitely does a good job of avoiding the easy way out, while also resolving what seemed like potentially weak plot points early on (the first example that comes to mind there is the idea that Thomas Carrasco\u2019s boss over at the DOD wouldn\u2019t be interested in him uncovering such an obviously evil plot). But to go back to Heidi, what did you think really drove her before she met Walter? I found her to be such a great character. And if you want to explain the fish thing to me, I wouldn\u2019t exactly be mad.\n\nMJ: All I can think of is Julia Roberts yelling \u201cEat your fish, eat your fish, eat your fish, eat your fish\u201d in \u201cAugust: Osage County.\u201d Fish, Maxwell! Is there anything more peaceful than little critters swimming in an intimidating office? Dentists know what they\u2019re doing. If only \u201cHomecoming\u201d did.\n\nYou\u2019re right, though. Heidi\u2019s motivations are hard to parse out. Late in the show, during a conversation with her mother (Sissy Spacek), we learn that Heidi had just earned her degree before starting at the Homecoming Initiative. I think the job was a huge moment for her. She was finally successful and able to help people, or at least that\u2019s what she thought she was doing. By the time Walter came along, she was anxious (maybe too anxious?) to develop the sort of bond that I imagine is satisfying for a therapist who sees her work as altruistic. It became her downfall. She put his health above her own in a really complicated way.\n\nIn a vague sense, aspects of this show seemed like a less macabre \u201cSharp Objects,\u201d another series you and I devoured this year. Both have a nonlinear structure, piercing camerawork and a slow-burning mystery. But that show felt languid, where this one is tight and flab-free. What do you make of its half-hour structure? How bingeable was it?\n\nAmazon Studios Bobby Cannavale in \"Homecoming.\"\n\nMS: Honestly, thank the lord. It was such a welcome change of pace to make it through an entire season of dramatic television in \u201conly\u201d five-ish hours. If we\u2019re going to enter this era where everyone is OK with television dominating our downtime, they might as well make more shows that don\u2019t require a half-a-day commitment. But a half-hour? Sure, I\u2019ll try it on for size! It also had the added benefit of making it feel like every line, shot and moment mattered here. Which leads me to the natural question about the final moments of the show. Are we supposed to believe she was satisfied with that lone encounter in the coffeeshop? And I\u2019m sorry to keep asking these sort of things, but what is it with him angling the fork? Am I an idiot?\n\nMJ: I love the ambiguity of that callback. Walter once angled a pen on Heidi\u2019s desk the same way he angles that fork in the diner. So he could possibly remember everything about Homecoming after all. Were I her, I wouldn\u2019t be satisfied. I\u2019d be running after him in a panic. But Heidi\u2019s never been a rash or confrontational person, so she has to sit with the (limited) information she\u2019s been given. Or else it\u2019s just a punchier dramatic conclusion.\n\nDid you catch the post-credits scene in the finale? The Marvel-ization of streaming TV, if you will?\n\nMS: I did! Albeit almost accidentally because I was enjoying the Iron & Wine song that randomly finishes out the series. That extra ending is yet another parallel with \u201cSharper Objects,\u201d I just realized. Why do we think she did that? I did enjoy the Tide 2 Go application.\n\nMJ: Iron & Wine, bringing people together again.\n\nI have an idea what the ending means, beyond creating room for a new thread to guide Season 2. I was hoping you\u2019d tell me. But I suppose we\u2019re not meant to know, or else what fun would that be?\n\nThis brings us to our overarching question, the one we\u2019ve more or less already answered: All things considered, would you recommend the series to someone else?\n\nMS: I think we both know the answer there. Julia Roberts does Hitchcockian, \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d-esque, modern-day sci-fi. Who wouldn\u2019t like that?\n\nMJ: Agree. She\u2019s fantastic in this show. Her best performance since \u201cErin Brockovich,\u201d I say. It\u2019s what her career needed \u2015 something other than mom roles and angsty family dramas that don\u2019t quite fit her. When Julia Roberts\u2019 career is surveyed down the line, this will be a big demarcation. Big. Huge!\n\nMS: The one thing I really need to know: What the hell is in those berries?", "Bloomberg via Getty Images Flames from flaring glow behind the Exxon Mobil logo at a refinery in California.\n\nDemocrats scored a string of state attorney general victories on Tuesday night, ousting loyal oil and gas allies and threatening to add to mounting lawsuits against the industry over climate change.\n\nThe party flipped four states and held 13, re-electing incumbents in seven of them. in an election sweep that secured Democrats 27 states that represent over 58 percent of the U.S. population and 63 percent of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product. The top-cop posts are considered the \u201cmost effective way\u201d to challenge President Donald Trump\u2019s environmental agenda.\n\nDuring the Obama administration, Republican attorneys general became a fearsome opposition force, coalescing around legal challenges to landmark power plant, health care and water regulations. The new Democratic majority comes as the party\u2019s rising stars are already jockeying to make names for themselves by sparring with the Trump administration.\n\nThe sweep Tuesday comes as climate change-related litigation at the city and county levels is finally making landfall in state capitals, with two states now suing oil companies and another charging ahead with an investigation that\u2019s likely to lead to a third lawsuit.\n\nRhode Island became the first state to sue the industry directly in July. The Ocean State named 14 oil and gas behemoths and their subsidies in a historic suit accusing the firms of creating a public nuisance under state law by failing to warn the public and regulators of warming and sea level rise the companies knew would result from increasing emissions.\n\nLast month, New York\u2019s acting attorney general sued Exxon Mobil, alleging that the nation\u2019s largest oil company defrauded investors by obscuring the risks its business faced due to climate change and regulations to mitigate it.\n\nThe newly elected Democratic attorneys general in those states are expected to continue the suits.\n\nBut the seats that flipped blue could threaten an industry that notched big wins on Tuesday night after spending more than $100 million to successfully tank three ballot measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nIn three states, the industry lost key allies.\n\nDemocrat Dana Nessel in Michigan routed her GOP opponent Tom Leonard, the state representative handpicked to replace outgoing state Attorney General Bill Schuette, who in September filed an amicus brief backing Exxon Mobil and calling climate change \u201cunsettled science.\u201d\n\nIn Wisconsin, Republican Attorney General Brad Schimel, who stormed to Exxon Mobil\u2019s defense in October, fell to Democrat Josh Kaul. The former prosecutor painted Schimel as a corporate stooge who \u201cput the interests of polluters ahead of\u201d the Badger State.\n\nBill Pugliano via Getty Images Dana Nessel was elected to be Michigan's next attorney general.\n\nNevada Attorney General Adam Laxalt began quietly deploying his state\u2019s legal resources to fight New York\u2019s investigation of Exxon Mobil two years ago. Not only did he lose his bid for governor to Steve Sisolak on Tuesday, but Democrat Aaron Ford also edged out Laxalt\u2019s heir apparent, Wes Duncan, in the attorney general race.\n\nMile-High Standards\n\nA slightly different dynamic emerged in the Colorado attorney general race, where Democrat Phil Weiser bested Republican George Brauchler.\n\nDuring the campaign, Weiser, a professor at the University of Colorado Law School, said he was \u201cuncomfortable\u201d with suing Exxon for its role in causing climate change.\n\nIn an interview with HuffPost, Weiser said he\u2019d consider the legal options available under Colorado law to hold polluters accountable for climate change. Yet he expressed skepticism about suing oil companies, suggesting it would make more legal sense to sue coal companies, which are already financially \u201con the ropes.\u201d He said he hadn\u2019t yet looked at the lawsuits the City of Boulder and two nearby counties filed to recoup climate damages from oil companies.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t studied them enough,\u201d he said. \u201cI know the cases exist. I haven\u2019t actually analyzed them in terms of the legal and factual merits.\u201d\n\nAsked whether he was avoiding making any remarks that oil and gas interests \u2015 including the law firm that donated most to his campaign \u2015 might interpret as a threat, he said: \u201cI am a lawyer first, and lawyers are trained to do their work before they reach their conclusions, and if I haven\u2019t done the work, I don\u2019t have a conclusion.\u201d\n\nKaul declined an interview request, and Nessel and Ford did not respond to repeated requests for comment. It\u2019s unclear how high a costly, time-consuming battle with deep-pocketed, well-lawyered oil companies might rank in their priorities. A former official in Michigan with knowledge of Nessel\u2019s thinking said she\u2019s likely to take on the issue.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s serious,\u201d said the source, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on her behalf. \u201cShe wants to go on offense. And I think she\u2019s got the wind behind her.\u201d\n\nBut the Democratic Attorneys General Association said it \u201cwill be something determined state by state based on the laws of the state and the powers of the office.\u201d\n\n\u201cHowever, as we know, Democratic AGs have been real leaders on climate litigation,\u201d Lizzie Ulmer, a spokeswoman for the Democratic Attorneys General Association, said in an email. \u201cWe know that some of our newly-elected AGs have made mentions or talked about these issues on the campaign trail.\u201d\n\nWRTV - Indianapolis Scripps Democrat Phil Weiser won the attorney general race in Colorado.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to tell which state\u2019s lawsuit might serve as a model for newly elected attorneys general. New York is suing under the Martin Act, an anti-fraud statute passed in 1921 to curb Wall Street excesses. Without robust financial centers, few other states have such laws on the books. And critics of the suit say it\u2019s a roundabout way of holding oil companies accountable for funding a Big-Tobacco-style misinformation campaign about climate science for decades.\n\nRhode Island\u2019s case offers a more direct path toward litigating responsibility for climate change, but is based on a state law that qualifies pollution of public property as a nuisance \u2015 an argument federal courts have rejected in climate suits.\n\nAnother potential avenue could be the one newly re-elected Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey is pursuing. For nearly three years, her office has been investigating Exxon Mobil alongside its New York counterparts since documents unearthed by InsideClimate News and the Los Angeles Times revealed that Exxon Mobil had understood climate change in the late 1970s. (Royal Dutch Shell, the Anglo-Dutch giant, predicted in 1998 it could someday be sued over climate change.)\n\nInstead of probing alleged financial crimes, Massachusetts is focused on potential violations of the Bay State\u2019s consumer protection laws that prohibit unfair and deceptive advertising, including the failure to disclose known risks and hazards associated with a product. The company sued the state, arguing it doesn\u2019t have jurisdiction to prosecute such a case because Exxon Mobil, headquartered in Texas, does not operate there. But the state\u2019s top court ruled that its franchised gas stations qualify. Exxon Mobil is now appealing to the Supreme Court.\n\nLast week, the nation\u2019s highest court rejected the Trump administration\u2019s request to halt a lawsuit over climate change filed by 21 plaintiffs ages 11 to 22. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals granted the stay on Thursday, pausing the suit. But the Supreme Court\u2019s decision suggests that, even with a stacked conservative majority, the justices could allow the Massachusetts case to move forward.\n\nIf it does, at least a dozen other states, including many of those with Democratic attorneys general, have virtually identical consumer protection statutes that could be used to sue Exxon Mobil or other oil companies.\n\n\u201cThis is not a case in which the company can credibly argue that these risks were not known,\u201d Carroll Muffett, president of the nonpartisan Center for International Environmental Law, said by phone. \u201cThere\u2019s simply too much evidence to the contrary in the public eye now.\u201d\n\nAll Eyes On California\n\nThe movement of states suing the fossil fuel industry over climate change won\u2019t hit critical mass, however, until California joins the fight, experts say. During a call with reporters hours after New York announced its suit against Exxon Mobil, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said he\u2019d \u201ctake a close look at the filing by New York\u201d \u2015 an intriguing prospect if only because California is one of the few states with financial statutes similar to the Martin Act.\n\nYet he\u2019s avoided the issue over his nearly two-year tenure, drawing criticism for what ThinkProgress called a \u201csoft approach toward Exxon\u2019s climate deception.\u201d Campaign contributions he received raised questions about his willingness to take on the industry.\n\nALM Media Climate litigation advocates looking to increase the number of states suing big oil are appealing to California Attorney General Xavier Becerra.\n\nIn September 2017, the oil and gas firm Phillips 66 maxed out its contributions to Becerra. In April, the attorney general accepted a $10,000 donation from the political action committee of Exxon Mobil\u2019s law firm, O\u2019Melveny & Myers, filings show.\n\nThe firm represents many large corporate interests, but the timing of the donation points to the oil giant, one of its biggest clients by market capitalization. It came one week after footage surfaced of the former Mobil chief executive in 1998 \u2015 before the firm\u2019s merger with Exxon \u2015 admitting to the link between emissions and climate change, two weeks after a federal judge dismissed Exxon Mobil\u2019s lawsuit against Massachusetts and New York, and three weeks after a landmark moment in the climate suit filed by the cities of San Francisco and Oakland.\n\nBecerra swept to victory on Tuesday after outgoing Gov. Jerry Brown (D) appointed him to his position last year. Now, as his state reels from a devastating series of wildfires fueled by climate change, pressure is mounting for him to decide whether to launch a suit of his own against the oil industry.\n\n\u201cAll eyes are on Attorney General Becerra, who is now elected on his own right,\u201d said Judith Enck, a former regional administrator at the Environmental Protection Agency. \u201cThe science links some of the wildfire damages to climate change, and why should the taxpayer have to foot the bill when Big Oil deceived the public? Becerra should really seriously consider a Rhode Island-style lawsuit.\u201d\n\nBecerra has nonetheless burnished his credentials among environmental advocates, having already sued the Trump administration over the rollback of environmental regulations 24 times. He won 14 cases, and others \u2015 including a challenge the EPA\u2019s gutting of fuel economy rules and power plant regulations \u2015 are ongoing. He also established his office\u2019s first Bureau of Environmental Justice.\n\n\u201cAttorney General Becerra has a very strong track record in fighting and winning to protect our people and planet,\u201d Sarah Lovenheim, an adviser to the attorney general, said in an email. She pointed to his past statement on the issue: \u201cIt\u2019s our policy at the California Department of Justice not to confirm or deny any potential or ongoing investigation.\u201d\n\nThe Golden State\u2019s armies of lawyers could offer vital reinforcements for beleaguered smaller states.", "Welcome to Good Stuff, HuffPost\u2019s weekly recommendation series devoted to the least bad things on and off the internet.\n\nPascal Le Segretain/Getty Images\n\nRather than wearing some plain old dress robes, Ezra Miller chose to attend the \u201cFantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald\u201d world premiere in Paris as a walking tutorial for what all basic muggles should do with their old North Face jackets.

Escher Crossover Event You\u2019ve Been Waiting For\n\nAmazon Prime\n\nOf all the names they could have picked for their new TV show, the creators of \u201cHomecoming\u201d might have landed on the least enticing one possible. That\u2019s a shame, because this show is riveting. Starring an inspired Julia Roberts, the new Amazon series rests comfortably in that genre of sci-fi that is just realistic enough for you to believe it could happen today \u2015 a multi-episodic version of the best kind of \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d episode. My colleague Matt Jacobs will do a better job than I ever could of convincing you to watch it, but I just wanted to quickly add that the cinematography in this show will make you wonder why other people don\u2019t try as hard. The use of angles takes this show up one Hitchcockian notch, and its willingness to sit on a good shot when it sees one pushes it up one more \u201cTwilight Zone\u201d-like level. Take this M.C. Escher-esque spiral, which could have been done a million other boring ways. \u2015 Maxwell Strachan\n\nBrian Tyree Henry Making You Cry\n\nDia Dipasupil via Getty Images\n\nBrian Tyree Henry is the alpha and the omega. The recent profile of the actor in GQ magazine is easily one of the best things I have ever read. And for a bitch who reads a lot, that\u2019s a high bar to clear considering that I hate 98 percent of things my eyes happen to glance upon.\n\nHenry is a vulnerable man. He\u2019s in tune with who he is, his pain over his mother\u2019s death, his timid happiness over not being broke anymore, his hesitation to fully embrace the blessings that come with fame and his complete immersion in his blackness. And his grounded sense of self spills over onto the page. That openness can be, in part, credited to writer Zach Baron, who is a god of feature writing and who often gets celebs to share glimpses of their souls.\n\nYet, what stood out to me the most were his poignant comments about his mother, who died two years ago in a car accident:\n\n\u201cWhat kills me is everyone\u2019s like, \u2018How do you feel about this Emmy nomination?\u2019\u201d Henry says to me. \u201cMy mother\u2019s dead. Every time I close my eyes, I see my hand on her casket. Every time I close my eyes, I hear my necklace bang on her casket. That\u2019s the last time I saw her. That\u2019s the only thing that gets me out of bed, and it\u2019s sometimes the thing that keeps me in it. So being busy helps, but y\u2019all don\u2019t understand. If she\u2019s not here to see it, I don\u2019t really get a chance to rejoice in it. You know what I mean? I\u2019ve buried a person every year for three years. I lost my best friend to cancer; then I lost my other best friend the next year to lupus. And I lost my mom to a fucking car accident. She wasn\u2019t even sick. She died in the most awful fucking way. So it\u2019s like\u2026 I haven\u2019t had a chance to even think about that. But I still have to survive. I like to believe that all these blessings are them. But it would be really nice to look to my left and see my mother sitting there when they call my name. You know? And I\u2019m being real fucking real with you. It\u2019s hard to do this stuff. It\u2019s just like she died yesterday, man. I haven\u2019t even looked at a photograph of my mom since she died. I can\u2019t look at her. And yet people are still celebrating and lauding this thing that I did about my mom. When, at the end of the day, I can\u2019t really rejoice in what I did, because I\u2019m still in pain.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a quote that breaks your heart, as cliche as that sounds. It reminds me of how I felt when my grandmother, the woman who raised me, passed. I was in a place where external things were going great for me, but inside I was a shambles. I lacked motivation, and I didn\u2019t see a greater purpose to my life. It\u2019s a dark place to inhabit. Yet Henry perfectly captures what it\u2019s like to currently be pushing through those feelings and survive them.\n\nEqually powerful were his thoughts on what his mother\u2019s broken relationships taught him about loving another person and himself:\n\nAnd what he decided was: Love was figuring out what you deserved and not waiting 68 years to go get it. Love was seeing your mother for the person she was and the person she could be. And love was, in the end, letting go of the idea that someone else would do for you what you would not do for yourself. After his mother passed, Henry says, \u201cI just started living in a place of, like, look, man: This world is full of millions of people. It\u2019s not about you finding them. Or y\u2019all finding each other. It\u2019s about you finding yourself.\u201d\n\nHenry is full of wisdom. His dialogue with Baron is a guide on how to love yourself and how to accept the people in your life for who they are. As I said, when it comes to celebs, Henry is the alpha and the omega. He is the beginning and the end of celebrities I care to hear from. I need nothing else. No other celeb profile will ever touch the hem of this one. Never.\n\nWe stan a fucking icon. \u2015 Julia Craven\n\nWhite People Failing To Form A New City Because Of The Cheesecake Factory (And Racism)\n\nPatrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nThere was a whole lotta racism going on in the 2018 midterm elections, but this one might take the, er, cheesecake. In Stockbridge, Georgia, a small group of rich white folks were mad about the fact that the exurban Atlanta town had elected an all-black city council and a black mayor for the first time in its history, so they launched an effort to split away and form their own new city. That\u2019s not even the worst of it; these rich white folks were going to carve up Stockbridge in a way that would crush the tax base. They also planned to redraw the boundaries so the black population would become a minority in both the old town and the new one. And that\u2019s not the worst of it either, because when it came time to find an explanation for the changes that wasn\u2019t obviously racist, the lady in charge of the whole deal declared that she was mad over the fact that Stockbridge wasn\u2019t an appealing enough place to attract a new location of The Cheesecake Factory. The Cheesecake Factory! *THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY!*\n\n\u201cI kept seeing all of these places like Bojangle\u2019s, Waffle Houses, dollar stores, and all this going up in our county,\u201d the lady behind the effort told CityLab. \u201cAnd I was like, why can\u2019t we get a Cheesecake Factory, or a P.F. Chang\u2019s or a Houston\u2019s? We have areas that have high incomes, so what\u2019s the deal?\u201d\n\nDo you realize how racist you have to be to use a basic chain restaurant that serves bland, overpriced cheesecake and something called a Glamburger to justify that racism? Do you realize how wrong about food you have to be to prefer The Cheesecake Factory to Bojangles?\n\nThe good news here is that this effort from rich racist folks with bland, tasteless palates failed miserably. It lost by more than 1,000 votes in an election that had fewer than 8,000 total ballots. So good for you, Stockbridge voters, for ruining this lady\u2019s day and for ensuring that if she wants her damn Cheesecake Factory, she\u2019ll have to wind her way through more than an hour of hellish Atlanta traffic to get it. \u2015 Travis Waldron\n\nThis Thriller About Sisterhood And A Serial Killer\n\nDoubleday\n\nThe title of this diminutive thriller from Nigerian author Oyinkan Braithwaite \u2015 My Sister, the Serial Killer \u2015 is such a blunt description of its subject that it sounds like it should contain the tear-soaked memoirs of a Wuornos sibling. No artful novelistic elision here! The book continues in this straightforward way, laying out its story in clear, precise terms.\n\nBut what a murky, unsettling story. Ayoola is a spoiled but gorgeous young woman who immediately turns the head of any man who encounters her. She also keeps ending up with dead boyfriends on her hands. As the novel opens, she\u2019s just killed a third boyfriend, and her responsible older sister, Korede, has been summoned to clean up the crime scene \u2015 not for the first time. Korede, who narrates the book, accepts Ayoola\u2019s flimsy excuse of having been attacked, just as she did the first two times. Then her irresistible little sister sets her eyes on a new romantic target: Korede\u2019s longtime crush, a handsome doctor. As Korede wrestles with which of her beloveds to protect, a police investigation into the disappearance of Femi, the third dead boyfriend, hovers threateningly over her.\n\nKorede\u2019s and Ayoola\u2019s motivations, at least their true ones, are more hinted at than explored, so diagnosing their troubled impulses, and the powerful bond holding them together, is part of the fun. Also, it\u2019s a taut, rapidly paced thriller that pleasurably subverts serial killer and sisterhood tropes for a guaranteed fun afternoon. \u2015 Claire Fallon\n\nThis California Dreamy Music Video\n\nBest dressed musician on planet Earth Kelsey Lu released a new video today, \u201cDue West,\u201d and boy is it delicious!

On Tuesday evening, he was among a handful of voters inside a Lutheran church\u2019s gymnasium, casting a ballot near a basketball hoop. He walked out into the cold and the wind, the sun setting over Sioux City, smiling. He felt proud.\n\n\u201cI got my citizenship two months ago, so this is the first time\u201d to vote, he told HuffPost. \u201cI\u2019m excited.\u201d\n\nYilma, 33, works at a meatpacking plant. The man who represents him in Congress, white supremacist Rep. Steve King, would rather people like Yilma not live in northwest Iowa, or anywhere else in America.\n\nKing is arguably the most bigoted member of Congress. For years, he\u2019s parroted and promoted the propaganda of white nationalists and neo-Nazis, and openly associated with fascist and far-right figures at home and overseas. \u201cDiversity is not our strength,\u201d he once wrote in a tweet.\n\nYilma said he\u2019d heard King didn\u2019t like immigrants. He decided to vote for King\u2019s Democratic opponent, J.D. Scholten, after seeing one of Scholten\u2019s campaign ads on YouTube. \u201cI trust him,\u201d Yilma said.\n\nIn the week leading up to Tuesday\u2019s election, to the shock of political observers, it seemed Scholten had a real shot at unseating King, an eight-term congressman who\u2019s routinely won re-election by over 20 percentage points in this rural, deeply conservative corner of the Hawkeye State. One pre-election poll had shown Scholten trailing King by just 1 percentage point.\n\nBut by late Tuesday night, the dream of a Democratic upset here was over. Scholten \u2014 a towering, 38-year-old former minor league baseball player and paralegal with a shaved head \u2014 walked around his election night party at a hotel on the Missouri River. He hugged and thanked supporters, posed for selfies and did interviews with local TV stations.\n\nAs the party died down, Scholten was a couple of beers deep and feeling candid. Earlier, he\u2019d done the polite and customary thing of calling King to congratulate him.\n\nCongressional Quarterly via Getty Images Iowa Democratic candidate J.D. Scholten\n\n\u201cStraight up, it sucked,\u201d Scholten told HuffPost about the call. He\u2019d lost to King by 3 percentage points.\n\n\u201cThe difficult thing in all of it is why the Iowa I know, the Iowa I grew up in, continues to go for King,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd honestly, that\u2019s the toughest question I have, and I still don\u2019t have a good answer for it. It\u2019s frustrating because, like, the bar of white nationalism, the bar of racism, the bar of anti-Semitism is so damn low. And we don\u2019t have a representative who can cross that bar. And that\u2019s difficult for me to grasp.\u201d\n\nKing has never denied being a white nationalist. On Oct. 21 he even appeared to defend the term itself, telling a local TV host that, although \u201cwhite nationalist\u201d is \u201ca derogatory term today, I wouldn\u2019t have thought so maybe a year, or two or three ago.\u201d\n\nYet on election night, over 159,000 people in Iowa voted for King anyway. And although there are multiple reasons for why King keeps winning here \u2014 including racism, name recognition, party loyalty and issues like abortion rights \u2014 it\u2019s maybe more instructive to consider why King came so close to losing this time.\n\nThere are 70,000 more registered Republicans than registered Democrats in Iowa\u2019s 4th Congressional District. President Donald Trump beat Democratic rival Hillary Clinton here by 27 points. That Scholten came within 3 points, or about 10,000 votes, of King is remarkable and shows he garnered support from Republicans.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m voting for Scholten,\u201d a middle-aged white woman said softly to HuffPost Monday night at a campaign rally for Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds. King, who had spoken at the rally, was standing just a few feet away. \u201cHe\u2019s too extreme,\u201d the woman, who asked not to be named, said of King.\n\nAlthough King has long been a bigot, he\u2019s been particularly transparent about his fascist beliefs during his eighth term in Congress. Just last month, King endorsed a mayoral candidate in Toronto who has recited the \u201c14 words,\u201d a neo-Nazi slogan. Also last month, HuffPost uncovered an interview that King had given to an Austrian publication associated with Europe\u2019s neo-fascist \u201cidentitarian\u201d movement.\n\nIn that interview, King pushed the anti-Semitic idea that the liberal, Jewish billionaire George Soros is funding what\u2019s called the \u201cGreat Replacement,\u201d the conspiracy theory that immigration from non-white countries spells the end of white European culture and identity. (It\u2019s the equivalent of the \u201cJews will not replace us\u201d chant at the deadly Charlottesville, Virginia, white supremacist rally last year.)\n\nKing had managed to espouse all this nonsense with little political consequence until late October, when the massacre of 11 worshipers at a Pittsburgh synagogue by a white nationalist brought King\u2019s own white nationalism under heightened scrutiny. Two days after the shooting, the polling firm Change Research published a poll showing King leading Scholten by only 1 percentage point.\n\nSuddenly the head of the National Republican Congressional Committee felt compelled to denounce King. Corporate campaign donors, under pressure for giving money to a bigot, ditched him. The Sioux City Journal, which had endorsed King in prior elections, endorsed Scholten, whose campaign was being inundated with donations: $640,000 in one 48-hour period.\n\nStill, it\u2019s hard to say how many voters abandoned King because of his bigotry. When King spoke at Gov. Reynolds\u2019 rally Monday night, he wasn\u2019t interrupted by a heckler calling him a racist. He was interrupted by a 44-year-old farmer, Dolf Ivener, upset over the price of soybeans.\n\n\u201c$7.50 for soybeans, I\u2019m going to go broke because of you, Steve King!\u201d Ivener yelled, before being escorted out of the rally. \u201cI\u2019m going to go broke because of you.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s trade war with China, which King supports, has taken a real toll on farmers here. China bought 94 percent fewer soybeans this year from America than in 2017.\n\nScholten likes to remind reporters of the Midwest\u2019s oft-forgotten history of progressive economic populism. In the 1980s, it wasn\u2019t a far-right figure like King representing this part of Iowa. It was a Democrat named Berkley Bedell, one of Scholten\u2019s political heroes. Bedell was a populist who focused on economic inequality. (Scholten keeps a photo on his phone of a Bedell campaign flyer from the \u201980s: \u201cDoes the 1% now own your government? Does the 99% have a chance?\u201d)\n\nCourtesy of the J.D. Scholten campaign.\n\nScholten\u2019s campaign, which refused to take corporate PAC money, focused less on King than it did on progressive economic policies: increasing the minimum wage (Iowa has one of the lowest minimum wages in the country), strengthening unions and fighting Big Agriculture, which is squeezing farmers here for every penny they\u2019re worth.\n\n\u201cThe average person in Congress is 58 years old with a net worth of a million dollars,\u201d Scholten told HuffPost. \u201cI\u2019m different. I\u2019m 20 years younger and about a million dollars short of that average because, you know what, I understand what it means to live paycheck to paycheck. I understand what it means to not have health care at times.\u201d (Note: The median net worth in Congress is about $1.1 million. Over half of the members of Congress are millionaires.)\n\nScholten campaigned hard. For six months, he drove around in an RV he called \u201cSioux City Sue,\u201d visiting voters in each of the district\u2019s 39 counties, sometimes attracting hundreds of people to town halls in deep-red parts of the district. At night he slept in the RV, which he often parked at Walmarts. (King, meanwhile, barely campaigned here, buying his first TV ad only a few days before the election.)\n\nAlthough Scholten was forceful in denouncing King\u2019s bigotry on the campaign trail, he spent more time depicting King as an absent and ineffective representative.\n\nIt was a message that resonated with The Des Moines Register\u2019s editorial board, which called its endorsement of Scholten \u201ca no-brainer for any Iowan who has cringed at eight-term incumbent King\u2019s increasing obsession with being a cultural provocateur.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn his almost 16 years in Congress, King has passed exactly one bill as primary sponsor, redesignating a post office,\u201d the newspaper\u2019s board wrote. \u201cHe won\u2019t debate his opponent and rarely holds public town halls. Instead, he spends his time meeting with fascist leaders in Europe and retweeting neo-Nazis.\u201d\n\nHuffPost tried multiple times in Iowa to ask King\u2019s campaign about why he was polling so poorly in this year\u2019s midterm election campaign. At Reynold\u2019s campaign rally on Monday, King\u2019s son and campaign manager, Jeff King, blocked a HuffPost reporter from attempting to talk to King.\n\nOn election night, at King\u2019s results-watching party, Jeff King asked HuffPost to leave the building. When asked why, he instructed HuffPost to refer to his quote in The Des Moines Register.\n\n\u201cWe are not granting credentials to The Des Moines Register or any other leftist propaganda media outlet with no concern for reporting the truth,\u201d read Jeff King\u2019s quote.\n\nOther alleged \u201cleftist propaganda\u201d outlets barred from covering King\u2019s party included the conservative Weekly Standard and The Storm Lake Times, a Pulitzer-winning newspaper based in King\u2019s district. It seemed King, known for being generous with reporters on Capitol Hill, was suddenly on the defensive.\n\nWith the close election results, there\u2019s hope among progressives that Scholten could mount a successful race next time. He had no name recognition when he started this race. Now people know who he is.\n\nOn Tuesday night, Scholten\u2019s phone lit up with text messages from big-name Democrats, including Sen. Corey Booker of New Jersey, congratulating him on running such a good race. Earlier he\u2019d heard from House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California.\n\nFor now, though, Scholten won\u2019t say whether he\u2019ll run against King in 2020. All Scholten knew, he said, was that he wanted eggs for breakfast in the morning and that, for now, he\u2019s just another \u201cunemployed\u201d and \u201csingle\u201d thirtysomething in America.\n\n\u201cIt just sucks,\u201d Scholten said. \u201cI wanted to beat him.\u201d", "Ice Cube doesn\u2019t mention Donald Trump by name in the lyrics of his new track, \u201cArrest The President.\u201d\n\nBut the former N.W.A. star doesn\u2019t have to. It\u2019s crystal clear who the rapper, whose real name is O\u2019Shea Jackson, is referring to.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s meet at the White House, run in and turn the lights out, they treat it like a trap house,\u201d he raps on the song from upcoming album \u201cEverythang\u2019s Corrupt.\u201d The tune\u2019s refrain: \u201cArrest the president...

In 2016, he responded to rumors that he\u2019d endorsed the then-reality TV personality with this savage tweet:", "PHILADELPHIA and GREENVILLE, Pa. \u2014 Back when he still lived with his family, when school was across the street from his home in West Philadelphia, Johnathan Hamilton used to plow through reading assignments and research religious questions online. He stumbled over fractions \u2014 math was always a struggle \u2014 but started getting into philosophy as an early teen.\n\nThen, at 15, his relationship with his parents grew violent, and Hamilton went to live in a city shelter for foster youth. When a bed became available at a residential facility in suburban Glenmoore, Pennsylvania, run by the nonprofit Devereux Foundation, Hamilton was sent to live there. For roughly nine months, he went to school on the grounds of the facility \u2014 and he says it was mostly lost time.\n\nClasses were full of kids of different ages. The material he was assigned seemed many grade levels behind. In one class, he remembers playing a lot of Bingo. \u201cIt just felt like day care,\u201d said Hamilton, who added that the experience left him with a senseless designation for a disability and gaps in his academic knowledge. \u201cIt was terrible. It wasn\u2019t school.\u201d\n\nYoung people in foster care across Pennsylvania \u2014 and the country \u2014 say that being sent to residential facilities often plunges them deeper into academic trouble instead of getting them on track. Schedules are filled with electives like movement therapy, art therapy and \u201cvalues.\u201d Worksheet- and computer-based education proliferate. The schools too often operate like educational black holes, failing to help kids earn relevant credits. Students complain of being kept on campus when they could be attending neighborhood schools. And government oversight is lacking.\n\n\u201cThe city of Philadelphia and the School District of Philadelphia expend enormous sums of money for the treatment and education of children in residential facilities and overwhelmingly get poor outcomes as a result,\u201d said Helen Gym, a Philadelphia city councilwoman and a former teacher who helped to start a new task force to reduce the city\u2019s reliance on residentials. Gym said local school districts sometimes reject foster youth \u2014 if the foster care facilities let them attempt to enroll at all \u2014 so they are \u201cbeing educated in the residential facility itself, which is not really equipped nor is it certified to really be a quality educational institution.\u201d (Pennsylvania has a law entitling every child in a residential facility to attend a local public school unless a court or, in certain circumstances, guardians and school officials override that decision, but many states do not. Advocates question whether the Pennsylvania law is followed.)\n\nThe number of children living in group homes, treatment centers and other institutions has shrunk in recent years as the residential warehousing of kids has fallen out of favor. According to a national 2015 study, on a single day in 2013, the most recent comprehensive data available, kids in those facilities numbered 55,916, 37 percent below the figure for 2004. Federal legislation passed earlier this year is designed to nudge states to further reduce the number of kids in residentials.\n\nData analysis by The Hechinger Report\n\nBut older youth still end up in residential facilities in significant numbers. According to the 2015 study, of the approximately 51,000 children 13 or older who entered foster care in one year, roughly half spent time in institutional settings. Some of these children have serious mental health needs or behavioral issues that child-welfare agencies say can make it difficult to place them with families. Some are consigned to residential schools because of truancy. In some, mostly rural, parts of the country, the opioid epidemic is driving more young people into residential care.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s 65 percent of the problem,\u201d said Cinnamon Evans, executive director of the Court Appointed Special Advocate (CASA) for Venango County, which assists foster youth. Overdose deaths in the northwestern Pennsylvania county rose by 300 percent between 2015 and mid-2017. Evans said she has started to see more children enter residential facilities in her area, like those run by Keystone Adolescent Center and Pathways Adolescent Center, because of parental drug abuse.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, lawyers say, many of the residentials are regulated like private schools, which is to say, hardly at all. While private schools are essentially monitored by affluent, tuition-paying parents who opt into them, no such checks exist for schools that serve foster youth, who by definition have been cut off from their families.\n\n\u201cThey treat them like prep schools,\u201d said Maura McInerney, legal director of the Education Law Center, a Philadelphia nonprofit that advocates for educational equity. \u201cThey can do whatever they want.\u201d\n\nThe Pennsylvania Department of Education does visit residential schools. But under its state education plan, it\u2019s only required to check in once every six years, and the agency\u2019s monitoring only concerns children with disabilities. When asked in a survey about the monitoring and sanctioning of residential schools, the Pennsylvania Department of Education told Hechinger/HuffPost to contact the state Department of Human Services. The education department declined further interview requests. DHS, meanwhile, said review of educational services fell to the education agency.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s out of sight, out of mind,\u201d said McInerney.\n\nCaroline Preston for The Hechinger Report/HuffPost Parts of the country hard hit by the opioid epidemic, like Oil City, in Western Pennsylvania, have seen an increase in young people entering group homes and other facilities for foster youth\n\nThe disregard for educational quality within these facilities is a national issue. Of 44 state education departments that responded to a Hechinger/HuffPost survey, most indicated that they sent foster youth to residential schools. But only 15 said their agencies conduct site visits and just one said it had sanctioned a residential school in the last three years. Of those state education departments that said they do conduct visits, only four do so at least once a year; the majority visit less often.\n\n\u201cIt is completely unacceptable for education agencies not to be monitoring and overseeing educational institutions that are receiving public funding,\u201d said Jesse Hahnel, executive director of the National Center for Youth Law, a nonprofit in Oakland, California, that advocates for disadvantaged children. \u201cThat is what these are; let\u2019s be clear about that.\u201d\n\nA 2013 report commissioned by the School District of Philadelphia and provided to Hechinger/HuffPost, found numerous concerns in its study of residential facilities run by three organizations \u2014 Horsham Clinic, Devereux Foundation and VisionQuest \u2014 where the city was sending hundreds of students. \u201cAcademic programs at the residential institutions lack rigor, are not meaningfully linked to state or national standards, and could not demonstrate acceptable student progress,\u201d the report says.\n\nAnd residential schools are expensive. Gym, the councilwoman, said that placement for one child at a facility today costs taxpayers roughly $140,000 per year. According to the 2013 review, Devereux Brandywine, where Hamilton attended, charged $85,886 per student for an academic year of special education services (that amount rose to $128,756 if the child required an aide). The group\u2019s president, who oversees facilities in 13 states, earned more than $875,000 in salary and other compensation in 2015, the most recent year for which the organization\u2019s tax forms were available. (Devereux declined an interview request for this story.)\n\nWhen Hamilton first arrived at Devereux Brandywine, he was sent to an alternative school off-campus. There he loved the teacher with whom he spent most of the class day, he said, though the academics often felt like review. But after about six months he was expelled following a disagreement with a teacher, he said, and began attending the on-grounds school. \u201cThere just wasn\u2019t a whole lot going on,\u201d said Hamilton, now 21 and tall, with a resonant voice and a full beard. \u201cIt was more like activities to occupy us during the day.\u201d He longed to leave campus for a martial arts class, as he\u2019d been watching Jackie Chan since he was little. But he said that Devereux staff denied his request, telling him that he was too old for the class and might use the moves he learned against employees.\n\nMichelle Gustafson for HuffPost Johnathan Hamilton, 21, experienced a lack of academic structure in the foster care system growing up. He is now a a freshman at Cabrini College.\n\nEventually Hamilton was sent to a group home in Pennsylvania\u2019s Carbon County where he attended a public school. But the designation for special education he\u2019d been assigned at the Devereux school, which he says was both unnecessary and de rigueur for the facility\u2019s students, trailed him. As a result, Hamilton says he was placed in segregated classes that were far too easy. After weeks of negotiations with school officials, he was allowed to enroll in all general education classes save math. The next spring, he graduated from the school, Jim Thorpe Area High School, after making the honor roll.\n\nAnother foster student, M.S., a 15-year old in the Western Pennsylvania city of Greenville, hopes to have the chance to graduate from a public school like the one she used to attend. She spent junior high and most of her freshman year at a mid-sized public school, earning A\u2019s and B\u2019s in algebra, her favorite class, and playing on the volleyball team. But this past spring her relationship with her grandmother, who\u2019d been raising her because her mother suffers from addiction, fell apart. M.S. started getting into drugs and missing school. She was sent into foster care and her academic future was thrown into question. (The full names of some minors in this story have been omitted to protect their privacy.)\n\nAt the shelter where she was sent to live, run by the nonprofit Keystone Adolescent Center, the staff were nice and caring but the education was abysmal, said M.S. The school day was a long stretch of sitting before a computer in a room with a single teacher who provided very little support. \u201cThe shelter school was horrible. They expected you to do everything online and get everything done within a short amount of time.\u201d\n\nAfter roughly a month, M.S. moved to Keystone\u2019s transitional living program, which sends most of its children to a nearby charter school run by the same family that operates the residential program. By then, however, the school year was wrapping up.\n\nSitting one July day in a Pizza Hut near the brick house she shared with seven other girls in the program, M.S. turned to watch as a set of elderly women greeted each other for lunch. \u201cOh my gosh, they are so happy,\u201d she said. \u201cSo cute.\u201d On unscheduled days like these, her main activity was sitting on the front lawn of the transitional living home, on a residential street, and watching passersby, she explained.\n\nIf M.S. stayed at Keystone, she would likely attend its charter school. But she was hoping that her cousins would foster her, and she could attend the high school near them.\n\nThe Keystone Charter School is a day school in the local school district and it serves kids in foster care and those who\u2019ve struggled in traditional public schools. The adolescent center and the school are big business for the family who runs them: In 2016, the last year for which tax returns were available, Robert Gentile, Keystone\u2019s executive director, earned roughly $158,000 in salary and other compensation; his brother, James T. Gentile, the finance director, earned roughly $157,000. Another brother, Mike Gentile, runs the charter school and serves as educational director of the Keystone Adolescent Center.\n\nTheir late father, James Gentile, who started Keystone and once led the school and adolescent center, was fined by the state ethics commission in 2013 for using his positions with those organizations to benefit a private company he also ran. At the time, James Gentile told a local newspaper that he took responsibility for the violations cited by the ethics commission. An attorney general\u2019s report in 2015 again raised similar questions about these arrangements, which involved lease agreements between various organizations operated by the Gentile family.\n\nIn a phone interview with Hechinger/HuffPost, Mike Gentile noted that the state education agency has approved these agreements and that he was proud the organization was a \u201cfamily business.\u201d He also said the shelter school was a \u201cgreat learning environment\u201d with direct instruction from a teacher and computer-based courses provided by the A+ online curriculum. Gentile emphasized that children remain in the shelter school only for short periods, adding that decisions on where to educate youth who live longer-term in Keystone\u2019s residential facilities are based on \u201cwhat\u2019s in the best interest of the student.\u201d\n\nCritics of residential facilities, meanwhile, include former staff. Roberta Trombetta left her job as head of Carson Valley Children\u2019s Aid, a nonprofit provider of residential services for vulnerable children, in frustration after coming to believe that facilities for children in foster care do more to hinder children\u2019s education than help. In 2015, she started C.B. Community Schools, a private institution funded by donations that serves foster youth in a former factory in a gentrifying section of northwest Philadelphia.\n\nAshley F., an 18-year old who spent time in residential schools including Carson Valley and VisionQuest, hopes to graduate this December from C.B. \u201cHorrible,\u201d said Ashley of the education at Carson Valley. \u201cHor-ri-ble. I literally did nothing.\u201d Kids were disruptive, teachers just handed out worksheets and one class consisted of watching movies, she said. (In an emailed statement, Diane Kiddy, chief executive officer of Carson Valley Children\u2019s Aid, defended the organization\u2019s services: \u201cOur educational program is distinguished by a trauma-focused approach to instruction which is individualized and includes therapeutic supports.\u201d)\n\nAshley\u2019s transcript is a confusing jumble. She received two final grades of 67 even though her semester grades in those courses added up to different numbers. An ecology course was renamed biology. And it\u2019s not clear why the school district gave her three math credits since the rest of her transcript suggests that she hasn\u2019t taken that many math classes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s made-up stuff,\u201d said Trombetta. \u201cYou\u2019ll see kids who\u2019ve spent a year at residentials and core content subjects aren\u2019t on their transcripts. \u2026 You\u2019ll see a lot of electives. You\u2019ll see kids identified at residential programs as special ed who had not been special ed before.\u201d\n\nEmployees of residential programs argue that their schools play a critical role in helping vulnerable children who\u2019ve struggled in other environments. They also say that staff ensure that kids attend school in the least-restrictive settings possible and note that courts often are the ones ordering kids into residential facilities and on-grounds schools.\n\nFalling under a patchwork of classifications within the state\u2019s education code, residential schools are a mix of family-run institutions, large for-profit and nonprofit providers, religiously affiliated organizations and smaller nonprofits. Carson Valley and Devereux Brandywine are situated on big, relatively secluded campuses. Pathways Adolescent Center is a cluster of nine or so drab, tan buildings on the outskirts of Oil City, a former petroleum-industry hub that\u2019s been shedding jobs and residents. The educational services there are meager and don\u2019t prepare students for life outside, according to reports from two former students as well as local officials involved with the child welfare system. (Pathways staff declined an interview request.)\n\nCaroline Preston for The Hechinger Report/HuffPost Residential campuses that serve foster youth are a mix of large for-profit and nonprofit providers, religiously affiliated organizations and smaller groups, like this one, run by Pathways Adolescent Center, in Oil City, Pennsylvania.\n\nThe 500-acre campus of George Junior Republic, which serves young men who are involved with the juvenile justice and child welfare systems, is flecked with brown brick buildings (called \u201ccottages\u201d), \u201cspecial needs units\u201d that provide education in a restrictive environment and a big school building that serves teens who have earned the right to be educated in that setting.\n\nUnlike most residentials, George Junior is run by its surrounding school district, so it follows Grove City\u2019s curriculum, employs its teachers and offers sports and other extracurriculars, according to Jim Anderson, the principal. It has six shop classes \u2014 including auto body, carpentry and food service \u2014 a music room and a classroom where new students spend a week of orientation. Boys who request to take Advanced Placement classes can do so at Grove City High School; two took AP classes this past year, said Anderson.\n\nYet Philadelphia recently stopped sending foster and delinquent children to the facility. Heather Keafer, a spokeswoman for the city\u2019s Department of Human Services, said in an email that the agency wasn\u2019t \u201csatisfied with the service delivery\u201d at George Junior and is trying to keep more youth closer to home. She also noted that her agency is not responsible for evaluating the facility\u2019s educational services. Anderson said George Junior and the Philadelphia government butted heads over how to care for these kids.\n\n\u201cThey are being sent here because the public schools couldn\u2019t handle them,\u201d said Anderson of the boys who come to George Junior. \u201cWe are a facility that\u2019s designed to handle the tough-behavior kid, to handle the child who doesn\u2019t like to come to school. Most of these kids get excited about education if they are here long enough.\u201d\n\nOne of those students is Oliver Francis, 18. A native of West Philadelphia, he was placed in foster care after missing roughly half his sophomore year at a public high school. A judge sent him to George Junior because it was more than 300 miles from home \u2014 too far to run, Francis said.\n\nHe\u2019d heard about problems at George Junior and didn\u2019t want to go. But his outlook changed not long after his arrival, he said, sitting for an interview one day this summer in the George Junior school building. Francis started to enjoy schoolwork, especially carpentry, and he caught up on credits through an online credit-recovery program George Junior offers before and after school hours. Six months in, he said, his family court judge offered him the chance to return to Philadelphia. But Francis petitioned to stay.\n\n\u201cI thought that if I stayed here, I was guaranteed to graduate,\u201d said Francis, who expects to enroll at Northampton Community College this year. \u201cIf I went home, the temptations of being out on my own, I didn\u2019t think I was ready for it.\u201d\n\nBut Francis, who was on George Junior\u2019s basketball and track teams, and won third place statewide in the high jump, said he wishes his courses had been more challenging. \u201cI did feel as though I could probably learn a higher subject, at higher levels of math and English and biology.\u201d\n\nCaroline Preston for The Hechinger Report/HuffPost Oliver Francis, of Philadelphia, was placed in foster care because he was truant. He graduated from George Junior Republic, a residential school in Grove City, Pennsylvania, this spring.\n\nAs Pennsylvania and other states try to thin the ranks of kids in residential facilities, they may find that simple solutions are elusive. California has shuttered many of its residential facilities and channeled more money to community-based alternatives.\n\nBut California continues to send some of its foster youth (approximately 300 at any one time) to facilities out of state. Occasionally they wind up at George Junior. (There\u2019s no federal data publicly available on foster youth sent across state lines, but advocates say the practice is relatively rare.)\n\nKate Burdick, a staff attorney with the Juvenile Law Center, a Philadelphia nonprofit that advocates for youth in the juvenile justice and child welfare systems, said that her group would like to see a day when no city foster children are educated in these facilities. Until then, she said, stricter oversight is desperately needed.\n\n\u201cThe real solution is going to be ultimately getting kids out of placements, out in general. But we\u2019re not giving up on improving quality for the young people who remain.\u201d\n\nSitting in the Pizza Hut this summer, M.S., the teen in Greenville, said she doesn\u2019t regret being placed in foster care. Her relationship with her grandmother needed mending, and she has learned to value herself and worry less about other people\u2019s opinions. \u201cI\u2019ve changed a lot as a person,\u201d she said. She missed her former school\u2019s principal and her old biology teacher, who had recently taken her out for Chinese food, but she was also ready for a fresh start.\n\nMost of all, she said, she hoped to get her academics on track so she could study to become a school psychologist. \u201cI want to be able to help people and make sure they have what they need for life instead of having them go through what I went through.\u201d\n\nIn August, her cousins agreed to foster her, enabling her to start the school year at the local public high school.\n\nAfter brief stints at a community college in rural Pennsylvania and in military training, Hamilton moved back to Philadelphia. He found an apartment in West Philadelphia that he paid for with money from a job in security and the help of an independent living program in foster care. (Pennsylvania is one of more than two dozen states that enable youth to stay in foster care until they turn 21.)\n\nOne afternoon in May, Hamilton sat at a small table in the one-bedroom apartment as his cat, Chun-Li, named after the female street fighter from one of his favorite martial arts series, circled his feet. The day before, Hamilton had received big news: He\u2019d been accepted to Cabrini University, a small, four-year college in Radnor, Pennsylvania. Despite some trepidation about returning to school, he felt certain he\u2019d enroll.\n\nHe planned to study communications, so he could one day produce martial arts films and other multimedia content. He is drawn to how the noble warriors in martial arts films use their moral and physical authority to halt misdeeds and misbehavior, in contrast to real life. \u201cMost people are bystanders,\u201d he said, \u201cand if not bystanders, enablers.\u201d\n\nHamilton had visited Cabrini and said he was impressed by its multimedia equipment \u2014 the college has a broadcasting center and radio station. He was also heartened that the university is one of a handful in Pennsylvania to participate in a new effort to help foster youth succeed in college.

Whitaker has criticized the inquiry in the past as too wide-ranging, which has raised concerns among Democrats that Sessions\u2019 ouster and Whitaker\u2019s appointment might be precursors to Trump moving to end it.\n\nSenate Democrats were considering suing Trump, the sources said, on the grounds that, in naming Whitaker, the president ignored a statutory line of succession at the Justice Department and deprived senators of their constitutional \u201cadvice and consent\u201d role on some presidential appointments.\n\n\u201cThe only two paths to that office are regular succession, and advice (and) consent,\u201d said a source close to the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\nDemocratic Senator Richard Blumenthal told Reuters late on Friday he was \u201cconsidering action that might be brought against an interim appointment that violates the normal statutory line of succession and raises very serious constitutional questions.\u201d\n\nHe said he was speaking only for himself and he hoped Republicans might join as plaintiffs if a lawsuit goes forward.\n\nThe Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution states that some senior government officials, known as \u201cprincipal officers,\u201d must be confirmed by the Senate.\n\nA spokesman for Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley said Trump had the authority to appoint Whitaker as acting attorney general temporarily, even though he had not been confirmed by the Senate.\n\nSuch appointments can be done for senior officials who have worked in the department for at least 90 days and can last for up to 210 days, spokesman George Hartmann said.\n\nAs the minority party in the Senate, Democrats might need some Republican support to have legal standing to sue Trump under the Appointments Clause, said Andrew Wright, who was a White House lawyer under former President Barack Obama.\n\nThe source close to the Senate Judiciary Committee said Democrats were unsure whether they would reach out to Republicans to join the lawsuit, but added it was \u201cnot likely.\u201d\n\nRepublican Senator Lindsey Graham, who earlier this year introduced legislation to protect Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is conducting the probe, said Whitaker did not pose a threat to his work.\n\n\u201cMueller will be allowed to do his job,\u201d Graham said in a Friday interview on Fox News Radio.\n\nJohn Yoo, a former Justice Department lawyer in the George W.

Whitaker, the nation\u2019s new acting attorney general, repeatedly chided presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in public statements during 2016 while he was speaking for a group that is barred by its tax-exempt status from supporting or opposing political candidates during a campaign.\n\nBefore coming to the Justice Department in 2017, Whitaker was president and executive director of the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust, a charitable organization that styles itself as nonpartisan government watchdog promoting ethics and transparency. The tax-exempt group \u2014 known by its initials, FACT \u2014 is supposed to serve the public interest under Section 501c3 of the U.S. tax code, without directly or even indirectly supporting or opposing specific candidates for office.\n\nYet the group has engaged in one partisan pronouncement after another, mostly directed at Democrats. During the last presidential race, Whitaker argued in July 2016 newspaper opinion pieces that Clinton should be prosecuted for her handling of her private email server \u2014 a favorite talking point of Donald Trump. The opinion pieces identified Whitaker as FACT\u2019s leader.\n\nIn September 2016, Whitaker argued that Clinton had acted shamelessly by appointing her charity\u2019s donors to boards of the State Department when she was secretary of state.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody in the history of our country that served in the administration has been this bold in their private fundraising and their sort of giving favors,\u201d he said in a radio interview posted on YouTube by his group.\n\nDaniel Borochoff, president of CharityWatch, a Chicago-based group that monitors the nonprofit world, said that statement appears to violate the IRS ban on engagement for or against a particular political candidate. \u201cIt\u2019s highly critical of a candidate, and he ought not to be doing that, because it\u2019s a political partisan comment,\u201d he said.\n\nWhitaker, a former U.S. attorney in Iowa, left FACT in October 2017 to become Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019 chief of staff. He was named this week by President Trump to take over at least temporarily for Sessions, who resigned at Trump\u2019s request.\n\nFACT was founded in 2015, tax filings show. Whitaker drew a sizable portion of its budget as his salary as president and executive director \u2014 in 2016 he earned more than twice what leaders of similar groups were paid on average that year, according to data from another watchdog group, Charity Navigator.\n\nIn 2015 and 2016, Whitaker earned a total of $654,000 from FACT \u2014 30 percent of its entire spending of $2.2 million over that two-year span. His 2016 salary was $402,000; the average CEO or executive director at 380 advocacy or education charities in that year made a salary of $173,099, according to Matthew J. Viola, a vice president at Charity Navigator.\n\nBorochoff suggested that Whitaker\u2019s board of directors at FACT didn\u2019t appear to be independent enough to apply the brakes on his campaign partisanship. Whitaker appeared to exert tight control over a three-person board of directors that included just one unsalaried member, according to the group\u2019s IRS filings in 2015-16.\n\nWhitaker\u2019s foundation was initially formed and then primarily supported with funds from another organization called Donor\u2019s Trust. That group is a nonprofit built to give conservative and libertarian philanthropists \u201cany level of privacy they want,\u201d according to its marketing materials.\n\nA FACT spokesman declined to provide any details on donors or any on-the-record response to other questions. There was no immediate reply to a request for comment from Whitaker made through the Justice Department.\n\nThough 501c3 groups can legally withhold the identity of their contributors and generally do so, there may be a distinct irony when a group dedicated to transparency keeps its funding sources in the shadows.\n\nIn 2014, FACT\u2019s only source of funds was Donor\u2019s Trust, according to IRS filings. In 2015, funds from Donor\u2019s Trust accounted for all but $191 of FACT\u2019s $500,191 in revenue. In 2016, Donor\u2019s Trust provided $800,000 of FACT\u2019s revenues of $1,350,265.\n\nIt is clear from IRS filings that FACT has paid outside Republican firms to perform some of its work. One such firm is America Rising LLC, which was given $144,000 for research in 2015.", "Brian Krista/The Baltimore Sun via Associated Press Rick Hutzell, right, the editor of The Capital Gazette, is joined by reporter Selene San Felice and photojournalists Paul W.

In a statement emailed to HuffPost, St. Tammany Parish Sheriff Randy Smith defended the handling of the case.\n\n\u201cThere was insufficient evidence to support a rape charge against Mr. Cowell,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThere was in fact significant evidence that the sexual encounter between Ms. Phares and Mr. Cowell was consensual, including surveillance video and statements of witnesses at the scene that evening.\u201d\n\nAccording to an investigative report by The New Orleans Advocate and WWL-TV, Amelia Phares told sheriff\u2019s deputies she was raped on May 22, 2016, after climbing into a truck belonging to a friend of a friend.\n\n\u201cWhen I tried to leave, he pushed me back and he raped me,\u201d the teenager said during a rape exam at Children\u2019s Hospital in New Orleans, according to notes on her medical records, which her parents provided to the news outlets.\n\nTimothy Phares said that in the months that followed, authorities \u201cdidn\u2019t follow up at all with the family.\u201d\n\nIn the interim, Amelia Phares struggled emotionally and started seeing a psychiatrist and a psychologist, her father said. He added that she was bullied at school was harassed on social media, and was distraught about not only the alleged incident but also her belief that authorities were not going to do anything about it.\n\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t like to talk about it and spent most of her time trying to pretend it didn\u2019t happen,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Nov. 14, 2016, Amelia Phares died after taking an overdose of sleeping pills. Before that, she recorded a short video for her family.\n\n\u201cIt was just a goodbye letter to the family in video form,\u201d Timothy Phares said of the video.\n\nJustice for Amelia Phares Amelia Phares, 16, killed herself a few months after reporting a rape to police.\n\nIn October 2017, nearly a year after his daughter\u2019s death \u2014 investigators told the family they were still waiting to receive a report on the DNA evidence, Timothy Phares said.\n\nHe added that investigators on two occasions said the district attorney\u2019s office closed the case but that when contacted by the family, the district attorney\u2019s office said it had yet to receive the case.\n\nIn February 2018, nearly two years after the rape was reported, the sheriff\u2019s office issued Cowell a misdemeanor summons for carnal knowledge of a juvenile.\n\nDuring the court proceeding, Timothy Phares said his daughter might still be alive if swift action had been taken.\n\n\u201cIf she had seen that the justice system was working for her to help her rather than help him or protect her rather than protect him, then she would\u2019ve fought this battle all the way to its end,\u201d he said.\n\nThat protection, Timothy Phares told HuffPost, was extended to Cowell even after the sentencing.\n\n\u201cThe guy who pled guilty and will serve no time in jail got a police escort to his car afterward, and the family of victim was basically told to go away,\u201d Phares said.\n\nHe alleged that officials at the sheriff\u2019s office have refused to take a complaint about the investigation.\n\n\u201cThe internal affairs division refused it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe then tried the Louisiana Attorney General\u2019s Office, and they said it was not within their jurisdiction. We tried speaking with the FBI, who said they could not help us either.\u201d\n\nThe sheriff did not comment on any attempts to file a complaint, but he did say the district attorney\u2019s office was in agreement with the police on the handling of the case.\n\n\u201cAlthough I have great sympathy for the Phares family, my first duty as sheriff is [to] see that individuals are charged only with those crimes that are supported by the evidence, and that is what occurred in this case,\u201d Smith said.\n\nThe family recently created a Justice for Amelia Phares page on Facebook in an effort to raise awareness about the case.\n\n\u201cWe believe that women in St. Tammany Parish are not safe,\u201d Timothy Phares said. \u201cThe sheriff\u2019s office has basically decided that they are second-class citizens. That\u2019s my opinion.\u201d\n\nSend David Lohr an email or follow him on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nIf you or someone you know needs help, call 1-800-273-8255 for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.

They would be the first humans on the list, which classifies endangered, threatened and vulnerable animal species around the globe.\n\nA video from the advocacy group (see above) makes its point in part by dressing individuals with Down syndrome in costumes resembling such endangered, threatened and vulnerable species as polar bears, lions and rhinos.\n\nThe campaign is a reaction to the fact that genetic screening has led to a significant decrease in people born with Down syndrome.\n\nSince the prenatal tests were introduced in Iceland in the early 2000s, for example, almost 100 percent of women who received a positive test for Down syndrome opted for an abortion, according to CBS. As a result, the condition has been almost completely disappeared from Iceland\u2019s younger population.\n\nSome people may believe that eradicating the condition is a good thing. But advocates argue that this kind of attitude contributes to a stigma that people with Down Syndrome are lesser humans. And that kind of thinking impacts societal awareness, funding and job opportunities for those who have Down syndrome and desperately need aid \u2014 hence the campaign.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s underfunded support programs for education, higher rates of unemployment, extended waitlists for appropriate housing, or even just negative public perception and stigma, the challenges faced by people with Down syndrome aren\u2019t decreasing \u2014 they\u2019re increasing,\u201d Laura LaChance, the board chair for the Canadian Down Syndrome Society, said in a press release.\n\nThe group told HuffPost Canada that by pushing to add people with Down syndrome to the endangered species list, it\u2019s advocating for the same kinds of \u201cfunding, protections, government intervention and public awareness that species on the Endangered List receive.\u201d\n\nMany people still found the campaign\u2019s comparison of humans to animals dehumanizing.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine folks with Down Syndrome would want to be considered a separate species. Mostly because they\u2019re, you know, humans. Your heart\u2019s are in the right place, but this seems wrong to me. \u2014 Joe (@MrJoeyK) November 9, 2018\n\nMy cousin with DS is human.

Though President Donald Trump traveled to Montana four times to campaign for Rosendale, Tester \u2015 a frequent critic of the president \u2015 defeated the self-proclaimed \u201cTrump conservative.\u201d And he did it in a state that Trump carried by 20 percentage points in the 2016 election.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Sen. Jon Tester, surrounded by family and supporters, announces his victory Wednesday in Great Falls, Montana.\n\nIn campaign advertisements featuring sportsmen and women with shotguns and fly-fishing rods, Tester\u2019s team touted his record of voting to protect public lands, and pegged Rosendale as an East Coast developer who threatened the state\u2019s wild spaces and way of life.\n\nRosendale, on the other hand, supported transferring federal lands to states during his 2014 bid for the U.S. House of Representatives. That year he told The Billings Gazette that \u201cpublic lands were never intended to remain in control of the feds.\u201d It\u2019s clear Rosendale recognized that was not a winning stance in Big Sky Country, and promptly reversed course during the campaign to say the exact opposite.\n\nTracy Stone-Manning, the associate vice president for public lands at the National Wildlife Federation and former chief of staff of Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, said Tester won in part because \u201cvoters didn\u2019t buy Rosendale\u2019s late and politically convenient conversion.\u201d\n\nWhile Tester has an 86 percent lifetime score from the League of Conservation Voters, the nonprofit advocacy group named Rosendale to its 2018 Senate \u201cDirty Dozen\u201d list of candidates it calls anti-environment. And LCV spent just shy of $1 million on an ad campaign highlighting Rosendale\u2019s support for rolling back federal land protections and his ties to fossil fuel billionaires Dan and Farris Wilks.\n\nIn New Mexico, incumbent Sen. Martin Heinrich (D), a fierce critic of Trump\u2019s national monument rollbacks who championed the creation of monuments and wilderness areas in the state, walloped Republican opponent Mick Rich, a commercial contractor who described Heinrich as the \u201cforemost proponent of turning New Mexico into an environmentalists\u2019 Disneyland.\u201d In Nevada, Sen. Dean Heller (R), who called the Obama administration\u2019s 2016 designation of Gold Butte National Monument an \u201cextreme overreach\u201d and urged the Trump administration to modify the boundary, lost his re-election bid to Rep. Jacky Rosen (D). Rosen, who has a 97 percent lifetime score from LCV, campaigned on protecting public lands, including Gold Butte and Basin and Range national monuments, and pushing forward on renewable energy.\n\nStrong support for public lands and environmental protection also appears to have helped boost several candidates in U.S. House races. In Arizona\u2019s 1st Congressional District, incumbent Rep. Tom O\u2019Halleran (D) defeated Wendy Rogers (R), who praised Trump\u2019s decision to open offshore waters and the pristine Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas drilling. In Nevada, Steven Horsford (D) defeated Cresent Hardy (R), and Susie Lee (D) beat Danny Tarkanian (R) in the state\u2019s 4th and 3rd Congressional Districts. Both Hardy and Tarkanian support transferring control of federal lands to the state. And in South Carolina\u2019s 1st Congressional District, Democrat Joe Cunningham, an ocean engineer, upset Republican Katie Arrington by standing firmly against Trump\u2019s offshore drilling plans.\n\nConservation groups, including CAP and Colorado-based Center for Western Priorities, also celebrated wins in a number of state races. Those included the victory by Colorado\u2019s Jared Polis, the first openly gay man elected governor in the U.S., who during the campaign connected his opponent, Walker Stapleton (R), to Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and the administration\u2019s efforts to roll back public lands protections.", "The nation\u2019s acting top law enforcement official was aligned with a company that is currently under investigation by the department he now oversees.\n\nActing Attorney General Matthew Whitaker was paid $9,375 in 2014 by a Florida company called World Patent Marketing Inc. to serve in an advisory role, and, as a former U.S. attorney, vouch for the business\u2019s general good standing.\n\nWorld Patent Marketing Inc. is now the subject of an ongoing criminal inquiry by the FBI, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday. And as of Wednesday, Whitaker is serving as attorney general, a role that could give him ultimate oversight into that investigation.\n\nPer the Journal, the investigation is being undertaken by the FBI field office in Miami as well as the U.S. Postal Inspection Service. There\u2019s no indication that Whitaker, who has been acting attorney general for little more than 48 hours, has taken any action or even been briefed on the case. Justice Department ethics officials will undoubtedly call on Whitaker to recuse himself from the investigation, though it\u2019s unclear whether he has met with ethics officials at this point.\n\nThe troubled company shut down in 2017, after a federal injunction brought by the Federal Trade Commission, and was ordered to pay a $26 million fine last May.\n\nThe Washington Post, citing two anonymous sources, reported that Whitaker rebuffed an FTC subpoena in 2017 seeking his records related to the company.\n\nAlthough the FTC argued World Patent Marketing was little more than \u201ca scam that has bilked thousands of consumers out of millions of dollars,\u201d Whitaker saw it differently in a December 2014 press release for the company:\n\n\u201cAs a former US Attorney, I would only align myself with a first class organization. World Patent Marketing goes beyond making statements about doing business \u2018ethically\u2019 and translates them into action.\u201d\n\nThe revelation about the investigation comes as Whitaker, a little-known Iowa Republican whose relationship with President Donald Trump led to his appointment Wednesday, appears prepared to seize control of the Robert Mueller special counsel investigation in spite of his extensive remarks about the probe as a cable news commentator.\n\nBefore he joined the Justice Department as former Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019 chief of staff last year, Whitaker routinely disparaged the special counsel investigation in appearances on CNN and on the radio. Whitaker was paid a $402,000 salary by a dark money group called the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust, which criticized Democrats on ethics grounds. FACT was meant to be the conservative answer to Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), a liberal watchdog group that on Thursday called on Whitaker to recuse himself from the Mueller investigation.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear at this point whether Whitaker has been formally looped in on the status of the Mueller probe. Within the Justice Department, there\u2019s little faith that Whitaker will recuse himself from the Mueller investigation, even if DOJ\u2019s career ethics officials recommend he do so.\n\nThe Justice Department didn\u2019t immediately return a request for comment late Friday.\n\nLast month, Trump said on Fox News\u2019 \u201cFox & Friends\u201d show that Whitaker \u201cis a great guy\u201d and said that he knew him but declined to talk about any conversations he had had with him about taking on the role. But by Friday, Trump declared that he doesn\u2019t know Whitaker and claimed he had never spoken to him about the Mueller probe.", "The targets of President Donald Trump\u2019s worst outbursts this week were black female reporters, and CNN\u2019s Brooke Baldwin has joined the numerous journalists eviscerating him for it.\n\nOn the air Friday, the CNN anchor defended the women the president berated. They included White House correspondent April Ryan, whom Trump called \u201cnasty\u201d and \u201ca loser\u201d; Abby Phillip, who Trump said \u201casks a lot of stupid questions\u201d after she asked him about the Russia investigation; and PBS News Hour\u2019s Yamiche Alcindor, whom Trump called \u201cracist\u201d for asking him about nationalism.\n\nThe journalists later spoke out about being subjected to Trump\u2019s insults.\n\nBaldwin described the women as \u201cconsummate professionals. A-grade.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey can take these insults. They don\u2019t need me sticking up for them,\u201d Baldwin said. \u201cBut still, there is something so wrong with this. It is beyond disturbing.

Even then, the secretary must directly sign off on all canine experimentation.\n\nThe department is actively planning medical studies using dogs, USA Today reported earlier this month.\n\n\u201cI love canines,\u201d Wilkie said. \u201cI was raised with them.

Experiments have been conducted on dogs as young as 6 months and involve surgeries to their brains, spines and hearts.\n\nThe dogs are killed at the end of the studies.\n\n\u201cThe VA has become a canine house of horrors,\u201d said Rep.

Buchanan, a military vet, was one of nearly 100 members of Congress to co-sponsor the PUPPERS Act, a measure introduced in 2017 that would have banned dog testing.\n\nRep. Brian Mast (R-Fla.), another co-sponsor and military vet, said his view on the treatment of dogs was shaped by his service.\n\n\u201cHaving sustained catastrophic injuries on the battlefield, which included the loss of both my legs, I am acutely aware of the vital role dogs play in helping troops recover from war\u2019s physical and psychological tolls,\u201d Mast said in a statement to HuffPost.\n\nWilkie defended the research by emphasizing the role of dogs in developments such as liver transplants and the pacemaker. He also compared the number of animals experimented on by the Department of Veterans Affairs \u2015 currently 92 dogs \u2015 to the substantially higher number euthanized at American animal shelters on a daily basis.\n\nJustin Goodman, vice president of advocacy at the animal welfare watchdog group White Coat Waste Project, called Wilkie\u2019s statements \u201cshameful\u201d and bashed canine research as \u201ca failed and widely-criticized program that wastes public resources desperately needed for veterans\u2019 care and services.\u201d", "In a world where it seems like most kids are glued to phones and tablets, it can be hard to find gifts for kiddos that will educate, inspire creativity and delight them.

She was among several other students who spoke to HuffPost this week about the shooting that eclipsed the Thousand Oaks community\u2019s much-lauded safety \u2015 it was, after all, the third safest city in America this year by one count.\n\nStill, Moyes wasn\u2019t surprised.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re having shootings at elementary schools, high schools, college campuses. At a bar, it\u2019s sad to say, but it\u2019s not that surprising. It\u2019s a tragedy and it\u2019s really sad.\u201d\n\nFor 27-year-old Chrystal Salas, a Moorpark College alum, the shooting was yet more evidence that, because of the gun violence crisis in America, there is inherent risk in just waking up in the morning.\n\n\u201cIt makes me reflect on how you can\u2019t go anywhere \u2014 you can\u2019t go to your small-town neighborhood bar without fear,\u201d she said.\n\nQuotes like that are a lot more common these days, especially after the February shooting in Parkland, Florida, that left 17 students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School dead. Americans \u2015 and especially young people \u2015 see the horrific rate of mass shootings in this country, and are beginning to collectively show signs of dissociation and desensitization.\n\nDrama therapist Jessica Asch spent her summer working with victims of trauma from Stoneman Douglas through two-week art therapy courses. Those students, she said, still have an acute fear of leaving the house every day, and some students\u2019 level of dissociation can make it difficult for them to brush their teeth, let alone work on their schooling.\n\n\u201cEating breakfast, brushing your teeth, getting dressed in the morning; these are things we take for granted, and these students struggle with immensely,\u201d Asch told HuffPost on Friday. \u201cTrauma dissociates you from your body and it takes a long time to integrate back.\u201d\n\nAccording to the American Psychiatric Association, dissociation involves \u201closing touch with awareness of one\u2019s immediate surroundings.\u201d Everyone\u2019s experienced it, as it ranges from daydreaming to \u201cmentally escaping from the fear, pain and horror\u201d of a traumatic experience.\n\nEvidence of such disassociation here is anecdotal, and Asch said that \u201ceveryone is different and I can only speak about the people that I work with.\u201d The evidence of trauma in young people dealing with shootings on a near-daily basis, however, is well documented.\n\nThe constant barrage of shooting incidents can also have a lasting effect on all of us. One of the most jarring quotes after the Santa Fe High School shooting in May \u2015 in which a gunman killed 10 people \u2015 came from a student who said: \u201cI wasn\u2019t surprised. I was just scared.\u201d\n\nPaige Curry, 17, told reporters that she was three classrooms away from where her fellow students were getting murdered, hiding while she waited for authorities to arrive. By that time in May, there had already been 21 other school shootings in which someone had been killed or injured.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always kind of felt like eventually it was going to happen here too,\u201d she said.\n\nAsch said it\u2019s extremely debilitating \u2015 even for a therapist \u2015 to live with the understanding that another mass shooting can and likely will happen very soon, at any place. Quotes like Paige\u2019s are signs of disassociation brought on by the barrage of bad news, and there is a lot of bad news.\n\n\u201cStaying in a constant state of panic is just too exhausting, so instead, people just have to turn it off,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Parkland kids, they\u2019re still so fearful. But others in the country are turning off. It\u2019s too much work to wake up and say, \u2018I might die today.\u2019 That\u2019s just too much for someone to handle. You end up dissociating.\u201d\n\nFor many people, every mass shooting \u2015 as common as they are \u2015 can be re-traumatizing. In fact, as many as 30 people at Borderline bar during this week\u2019s shooting also attended a music festival in Las Vegas last year at which a gunman killed 58 people and injured over 800 more.\n\nThe young people in the Thousand Oaks community \u2015 and nationwide \u2015 have to grapple with the fact that mass shootings now occur at places of worship, movie theaters, schools, airports, yoga studios, music festivals and anywhere else they might go when they walk outside their door.\n\nIn one sense, that knowledge may have helped; young folks know to escape quickly when they hear gunfire.", "Governor-elect Gavin Newsom on Friday issued emergency proclamations and requested federal assistance for massive new wildfires in the state \u2015 the Camp fire in Butte County and the Hill and Woolsey fires in Los Angeles and Ventura.\n\nThe fact that it\u2019s nearly winter and two massive fires are currently burning through parts of Northern and Southern California should surprise no one at this point. In the last year, California has witnessed some of the most destructive and record-breaking fires in the state\u2019s history. To fire experts, public officials and the victims of these disasters the reality is clear: Devastating, year-round wildfires are the new normal, and things may get worse before they get better.\n\nGov. Jerry Brown (D) in September signed a round of bills aimed at preventing and recovering from wildfires, including reducing the risk of bankruptcy for utility companies and allowing for more prescribed burns.\n\nThe issue of California\u2019s wildfire crisis popped up repeatedly during the state\u2019s governor\u2019s race. Now with Newsom set to take the helm, there\u2019s an opportunity for the state to reassess its approach to wide-ranging environmental issues, including how it prepares for and recovers from wildfires. Both on the campaign trail and as lieutenant governor, Newsom discussed his views on how best to address the state\u2019s wildfire crisis.\n\nHere are some of the things he\u2019s said he would do.\n\nImprove Vegetation Management\n\nAssociated Press Dried vegetation poses a major wildfire threat.\n\nNewsom knows firsthand the importance of clearing dead brush from fire-prone land. Dried vegetation poses a major wildfire threat and has gotten particularly bad and widespread in California due to years of drought.\n\nIn October, Newsom told The San Diego Union Tribune his family had recently spent $35,000 to clear a patch of dead trees from his father\u2019s property in Dutch Flat \u2015 a small town in Placer County, where a fire burned through over 1,000 acres in September. \u201cThe dead trees up there are legendary,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cIt was jaw-dropping the cost just to one property owner\u201d to remove dried vegetation that could pose a fire threat.\n\nNewsom says state as a whole needs to get more aggressive on clearing dead trees and brush so that property owners don\u2019t bear the burden alone.\n\nReconstitute The Emergency Council\n\nBrown established the California Emergency Council in 2005 under the Emergency Services Act with the aim that it would act as an official advisory body to the governor in times of emergency. As lieutenant governor, Newsom served as the council\u2019s second-in-command.\n\nThe council may have once served a purpose but has been largely defunct in recent years. Its last scheduled meeting was on June 30, 2010, according to the council\u2019s website. During his campaign, Newsom has promised to revive the council to address future wildfires and other disasters.\n\nEmploy New Technologies To Predict And Respond To Disasters\n\nThe shortcomings of California\u2019s emergency alert systems came under scrutiny last year after a series of destructive blazes ripped through the state.\n\nNewsom hopes technology can help improve the response in the future. The state\u2019s wildfire crisis presents \u201copportunities to dust off new technologies\u201d like artificial intelligence, drones and infrared tools, Newsom told NPR in October last year.\n\nAssociated Press Five people have been reported dead from the Camp fire.\n\nThe governor-elect has said he plans to install a network of early-warning infrared cameras that could spot wildfires and alert public safety officials about new blazes. He also said he also wants to use artificial intelligence and improved weather monitoring technology to predict and contain wildfires.\n\nSuch technologies can \u201cget out there and get ahead of some of these fires in ways that, frankly, only technology can provide,\u201d Newsom said.\n\nImprove Fire-Conscious Urban Planning\n\nThe state\u2019s worsening wildfire crisis hasn\u2019t deterred contractors from developing land in fire-prone areas, exponentially increasing the risk to residents and property.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the \u2018expanding bull\u2019s eye\u2019 effect,\u201d Villanova University geographer Stephen M. Strader told The Mercury News in August. \u201cCities are moving into regions where there were no people before. People and wildfires are coming together more often.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an issue Newsom has said he wants to address. \u201cAs we look to increase the state\u2019s housing supply, we must also convene stakeholders to design the future of urban planning,\u201d he told The Los Angeles Times in September.\n\nFight Climate Change\n\n\u201cThe science is clear \u2014 increased fire threat due to climate change is becoming a fact of life in our state.\n\nUnlike the federal government \u2015 which owns roughly 46 percent of California\u2019s acreage and which, under the Trump administration, rejects the scientific consensus on climate change \u2015 Newsom stands firm that California\u2019s wildfire crisis is part of a larger global phenomenon.", "Associated Press Lucy McBath speaks during a rally for Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams at Morehouse College in Atlanta on Nov. 2. McBath beat Republican incumbent Karen Handel in a tight race in Georgia's 6th Congressional District.\n\nDemocrat Lucia \u201cLucy\u201d McBath won her race for Congress in Georgia\u2019s traditionally Republican 6th Congressional District, the same suburban Atlanta seat where massively funded Jon Ossoff lost a special election just last year.\n\nMcBath, a gun control advocate, beat Republican incumbent Karen Handel by only a few thousand votes \u2015 with McBath declaring victory Wednesday and Handel conceding Thursday.\n\nMcBath succeeded thanks foremost to the down-ballot impact of Stacey Abrams\u2019 gubernatorial run, according to Kerwin Swint, a political science professor at Kennesaw State University.\n\n\u201cLucy McBath had the Stacey Abrams energy and turnout and excitement that Ossoff didn\u2019t have,\u201d Swint said.\n\nAbrams is locked in a still-too-close-to-call race with Republican Brian Kemp in an election dogged by voter suppression issues.\n\n\u201cWhen the voters of Georgia are allowed to pick their candidate without the interference of vote suppression, Georgians choose leadership that is more reflective \u2026 of the people of the state,\u201d said Nse Ufot, the executive director of the New Georgia Project, a nonpartisan nonprofit. \u201cIf every vote is allowed to count, we\u2019re going to see a bunch of Lucys.\u201d\n\nMcBath\u2019s authenticity and deep roots in the district were also significant factors, according to Stacey Evans, a supporter who represented part of the 6th District in the state House until 2017. Republicans blasted Ossoff, who was raised in the district, for living just outside its boundaries during his high-profile run.\n\n\u201cShe had the personal background of having been in the district for many, many years, raising a son there. She was the district,\u201d Evans said.\n\nPraising McBath\u2019s down-to-earth demeanor, Evans added, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if she\u2019s speaking to a big crowd or she\u2019s talking to you one on one \u2015 you get Lucy.\u201d\n\nWhen President Donald Trump tapped Tom Price, the longtime conservative congressman from Georgia\u2019s 6th Congressional District, as his health and human services secretary in early 2017, Democrats sensed an opportunity.\n\nThe suburban district \u2015 an increasingly diverse hub of highly educated and affluent Republicans \u2015 had already shown its dissatisfaction with Trump. In 2016, Price won re-election there by 23 percentage points, but Trump edged Hillary Clinton there by less than 2 points.\n\nJon Ossoff, a 31-year-old documentary filmmaker and former congressional aide, ran for the seat as a cautious, moderate Democrat focused on restoring civility to the office. He drew some criticism from some progressives for avoiding firm stances on pocketbook issues like student debt relief in favor of centrist bromides about deficit reduction and \u201cconsolidat[ing] federal data centers.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlaying to the center or trying to out-Republican Republicans is not how you win swing districts,\u201d Ufot said.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if she\u2019s speaking to a big crowd or she\u2019s talking to you one on one \u2015 you get Lucy. Stacey Evans, former state representative\n\nTo some degree, Ossoff was a victim of timing. Coming just months after Trump\u2019s election, his candidacy blew up first on Daily Kos and then more broadly.\n\nHe became a national liberal rock star, complete with regular appearances on MSNBC and high-profile support from progressive actress Alyssa Milano and other celebrities.\n\nBy the end of the race, Ossoff raised an eye-popping nearly $30 million. But the national attention and resources came at a high price: Republicans spent heavily as well, turning the race into a contest of partisan identity that Ossoff could not win in a district with so many registered Republicans.\n\nHe lost to Handel, an ardent abortion rights opponent, by about 4 percentage points. In a special election the same day in another solid red district in South Carolina, the Democrat came up short by a smaller margin.\n\nEvans suggested that Ossoff lost not despite getting outsize attention and resources but at least partly because of it.\n\nShe emphasized that she did not blame Ossoff for the national tenor his bid took on, but \u201cmotivating your own base doesn\u2019t happen in a vacuum,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you do something to motivate your base, you may well be doing something that motivates the opposite party\u2019s base.\u201d\n\nJoe Raedle/Getty Images Jon Ossoff delivers his concession speech on June 20, 2017.\n\nOssoff\u2019s defeat was not a total loss for area Democrats. His candidacy prompted the creation of a sophisticated Democratic voter turnout operation driven by a base of enthusiastic volunteers that did not go away.\n\nThe infrastructure was there for McBath, a 58-year-old African-American woman and former Delta Airlines flight attendant, to take advantage of a year later.\n\n\u201cJon laid incredible groundwork,\u201d Evans said. \u201cLucy was able to capitalize on the volunteer grassroots energy and put it to work.\u201d\n\nShe ran on a platform of tougher gun safety regulations, affordable health care, ensuring women\u2019s reproductive rights and preserving middle-class tax cuts.\n\nUnlike Ossoff, who endured relentless attacks for living outside the district, McBath could point to an ongoing, deep presence in the community. In Cobb County, she helped create the Champion in the Making Legacy Foundation, which helps fund higher education for local high school graduates.\n\nAnd while she won endorsements from former President Barack Obama, Clinton and EMILY\u2019s List, her contest was among more than 100 hotly contested congressional races, ensuring that she would not endure the counterproductive level of attention that Ossoff got.\n\nAlso, McBath had a compelling personal story that she connected to her moderately liberal policy stances. She was first thrust into the national spotlight in 2012 when her teen son, Jordan Davis, was shot dead by a white man at a Florida gas station angry about the volume of the music Davis was playing in his car. Her tragic loss spurred her into activism, as a spokesperson for gun safety group Moms Demand Action, and now into political office.\n\nMcBath spoke frequently about her son\u2019s death in arguing for the closure of background check loopholes and raising the minimum firearm purchasing age to 21, among other changes.\n\nBut she did not focus on gun safety to the exclusion of other issues. In a 30-second TV spot that came out in the final month of the race, she spoke about the tragedy as an event that inspired her public service without referring to guns at all.\n\n\u201cWhen my son was murdered, I vowed to make a difference,\u201d she says in the spot. \u201cI will fight to protect women\u2019s health care and middle class tax cuts.\u201d\n\nMcBath is also a two-time survivor of breast cancer. She invoked her experience when making the case for defending the Affordable Care Act\u2019s protections for people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nSwint said women were the key swing voters in the district. By virtue of her gender and the ordeals she had undergone, McBath could simply speak to those voters in a way Ossoff could not.\n\n\u201cHer personal story resonated with the female voters in that district. McBath connected with them,\u201d Swint said.\n\nNotwithstanding Georgia\u2019s pro-gun conservatism, the proliferation of mass shootings has nudged many suburban women with conservative fiscal tendencies to embrace stricter gun laws. And though Georgia\u2019s 6th District is more than two-thirds white, constituents from communities of color may have found McBath\u2019s message particularly appealing. Polling shows higher support for gun control among black and Latino voters, who experience a disproportionate share of gun violence, than among their white counterparts.", "It\u2019s a dreadful reality of living in America right now that there are, and likely will be more, mass shootings. Though it may be impossible to predict where and when they\u2019ll occur \u2015 and the odds are very small that you\u2019ll encounter one \u2015 security experts have some basic safety tips that can help you prepare for the unlikely but horrific situation.\n\n\u201cDuring an active shooter situation, it is estimated that law enforcement response time may be between five to six minutes. And on average, an active shooter situation lasts anywhere between five to eight minutes,\u201d said Steve Guerrero, director of security for the nonprofit Green Dot Public Schools in Los Angeles.\n\nSo saving your life may be up to you. No one should ever have to fear for their safety in a bar, a place of worship, an exercise class or any other ordinary location. But a little knowledge \u2015 hopefully knowledge that you never have to use \u2015 can be beneficial.\n\nHuffPost talked with the experts on what they want everyone to know about potential or active shooter situations, including steps to take when something seems off and other useful protection measures.\n\n1. Be aware.\n\nIt sounds basic but sometimes the most obvious points are the most crucial. Put down your phone and tune in to your surroundings.\n\n\u201cIn security, we often refer to the phrase \u2018situational awareness,\u2019 being aware of our situation wherever we are,\u201d said Brent O\u2019Bryan, corporate vice president of training and organizational effectiveness at Allied Universal, a private North American security company.\n\nWhen you first walk into a building, O\u2019Bryan recommends getting your bearings and taking inventory of your surroundings: Notice the people in the room, the layout of the venue, where the nearest exits are and whether anything appears off.\n\n2. Make a brief, mental \u201cwhat if\u201d plan ahead of time.\n\n\u201cPeople have to unfortunately have the mindset these days that when you walk into anywhere, something bad can happen and you have to begin to mentally prepare yourself with the \u2018what if\u2019 scenario,\u201d said Mike Zimet, owner of New York-based executive protection company Mike Zimet Protective Services.\n\nIf used correctly, that strategy could potentially save somebody\u2019s life.\n\n\u201cWe use the what-if scenario in protection all the time,\u201d Zimet said. \u201cWhat if this happens? What would you do with the person you are protecting? How would you evacuate them?\u201d\n\nThis type of thinking, he added, trains you to be a lot more diligent in looking for exits or a safe room where you can shelter. Take a few minutes to put an escape plan into place when you first arrive at a venue, he suggested, and then go back to enjoying the evening.\n\n3. Know what to look for.\n\nWhen taking inventory of a place or scenario, be on the lookout for anything that appears suspicious.\n\n\u201cThe biggest red flag is somebody appearing out of place by their clothing \u2015 they are dressed for the winter in the summer \u2015 or by their actions,\u201d Zimet said. Actions to watch for include leaving a suspicious package behind or behaving uncharacteristically for the setting.\n\n4. Don\u2019t be afraid to report something suspicious.\n\n\u201cBe aware of your neighbors, people\u2019s activity on social media, and don\u2019t be afraid to share your concerns,\u201d O\u2019Bryan said.\n\nIf something seems suspicious, you shouldn\u2019t assume that somebody else is going to call it in or otherwise report it. Make the call yourself.\n\n\u201cWe need to do better as a society with having that courage to step in when we see something that doesn\u2019t seem right,\u201d O\u2019Bryan said. \u201cLaw enforcement would rather have us be more proactive in sharing leads and concerns so they can say, \u2018OK, that\u2019s not a concern\u2019 or \u2018That is a concern\u2019 than have us thinking, \u2018That looks suspicious but I\u2019m not sure if it is so I\u2019m just going to hold back.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cTrust your gut instinct when something niggles at the back of your mind that something is wrong,\u201d added Robert Sollars, a security consultant based in Phoenix with 35 years experience in the industry. Too many people ignore those feelings even though they could save lives, Sollars said.\n\n\u201cTrust your gut instinct when something niggles at the back of your mind that something is wrong.\u201d - Robert Sollars, a Phoenix-based security consultant\n\n5. Try to remain as calm as possible.\n\nFocus on breathing in through your nose and out through your mouth as you take action.\n\n\u201cRemaining calm and focused can mean the difference between life and death,\u201d Guerrero said, adding that a \u201cheightened state of panic may impair your judgment and ability to make sound decisions when time is of the essence.\u201d\n\nMatt Harden, a SWAT team member and owner of the San Francisco Bay Area company OpTempo Training Group, which provides active shooter training, noted that staying calm also helps people \u201cto not alert the shooter to their location.\u201d\n\n6. Run if you\u2019re able to.\n\nIn a situation involving an active shooter, your immediate move should be to get out of the building if you can safely do so. And once you are through the door, don\u2019t stop.\n\n\u201cKeep going and get as far away from the line of fire as you can,\u201d Zimet said. Don\u2019t assume that you\u2019re safe once outside just because the gunfire is happening inside.\n\n\u201cMany gunmen go in through front door. The same way they went in shooting, they can come out shooting. So if you are lingering outside, you could find yourself back in the line of fire,\u201d Zimet warned.\n\nEven though it might be your first instinct, O\u2019Bryan said you should not stop to dial 911 before running.\n\n\u201cGet to safety and then make that call. To stop and make that call immediately, you are risking yourself and you\u2019ve gotten rid of a few seconds you could be using to get somewhere safely to make the call,\u201d he said.\n\n7. Hide if you need to.\n\nIf you can\u2019t get safely to an exit and out the door, your second choice is to hide.\n\n\u201cLaw enforcement will arrive quickly and if you can\u2019t run, then your next best option is to hide and wait for them to arrive,\u201d O\u2019Bryan said.\n\nOnce you are hidden and secure, remain quiet and still. \u201cHiding is not the time to get on your phone,\u201d O\u2019Bryan added. \u201cIf you have that opportunity and you truly think you are safe, you can reach out to 911, but you want to be very careful. Especially in a dark situation, you want to maintain the darkness. You don\u2019t want to have your phone on to give you away.\u201d\n\nZimet recommended concealing yourself behind the hardest object possible so as to shield yourself from bullets. O\u2019Bryan also suggested looking for a room with a door that you can lock from the inside, if possible.\n\n\u201cHiding is not the time to get on your phone. If you have that opportunity and you truly think you are safe, you can reach out to 911, but you want to be very careful.\u201d - Brent O\u2019Bryan, corporate vice president at Allied Universal\n\n8. Stay hidden for the long haul.\n\nOnce hidden, don\u2019t come out until law enforcement arrives and announces that they are ready to escort you out. Don\u2019t try to determine when it\u2019s safe to emerge on your own accord.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re hiding and still in the building when law enforcement arrives, be prepared for officers with rifles entering to deal with the threat,\u201d Harden said, adding that it\u2019s crucial you stay where you are and not try to run over to them even if you\u2019re injured.\n\n\u201cYou can call out to them but they will find you,\u201d he said. \u201cFollow their commands.\u201d\n\nOfficers are entering a very uncertain, chaotic scene and will be focused on clearing the entire structure to ensure there are no additional shooters or threats. \u201cThe initial officers may bypass injured people asking for help until the scene is secure. But they will return to render aid and evacuate,\u201d Harden said.\n\n9. Get low to the ground.\n\nIf you can\u2019t run away or find a hiding space, or you\u2019re out in the open, you\u2019ll want to get as low as possible.\n\n\u201cDuck down to the floor and try to put yourself in a fetal position because that reduces the amount of target that somebody is targeting at,\u201d Zimet said.\n\nDropping to the ground can also help to get you out of the line of sight of an active shooter and reduce your chances of getting hit by gunfire. \u201cThe more you reduce your size and your target, the better chance you have of surviving,\u201d said Zimet.\n\n\u201cDuck down to the floor and try to put yourself in a fetal position because that reduces the amount of target that somebody is targeting at.\u201d - Mike Zimet, owner of Mike Zimet Protective Services\n\n10. Fight back only as a last resort.\n\nYour safety comes first. Attempting to stop an active shooter is only advised if they are extremely close to you and you cannot take any of the above safety steps, Zimet said. Basically, only try this if it\u2019s your sole option.\n\n\u201cDo not run across a huge distance to the attacker and hop into their line of sight in the process,\u201d he said, noting that if you do attack, your focus should be on lunging at the person and going after the weapon.\n\n\u201cThe attacker will not be expecting an attack from a victim so the bigger, louder and more violent you can be, the more you will disrupt their train of thought. If you have a group of people, even better,\u201d said Tammy Johnson, CEO of Bravo1 Protection, an event security service in South Carolina.\n\n11. Finally, curb your curiosity.\n\nIf a shooting happens in your neighborhood and you are not actively caught in the situation, remain a safe distance away. Louis Perry, the owner and executive vice president of Los Angeles-based Kadina Security who has provided security for politicians, former presidents and other high-profile individuals, said that often someone shoots a gun and people actually run toward the sound of the gunfire to see what\u2019s going on.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s human nature to be curious but you don\u2019t want to do that,\u201d Perry said. \u201cI know it sounds silly to say this but if somebody shoots a gun, you want to run away from the gunfire.\u201d", "More than 1,000 teachers and other education professionals won state legislative seats across the country in Tuesday\u2019s elections, the nation\u2019s largest teachers union said Friday.\n\nMore than 1,500 current and former teachers and education professionals sought office in the 2018 elections, the National Education Association announced in October. Teacher-led protests swept states from West Virginia to Arizona last winter and spring, leading to an exceptional influx of candidates.\n\nThe group said the final tally before Election Day numbered more than 1,800 such candidates. Of those, the union said, 1,081 won their races for state legislative seats on Tuesday.\n\nThat success means teachers and educators will hold roughly 15 percent of all state legislative positions nationwide next year, based on the number of such positions counted by the National State Legislative Council. An additional 42 races have yet to be called, the NEA said.\n\nA lack of historical data makes it hard to compare this year\u2019s numbers or success rates to previous elections, or to draw a direct connection between those victories and the earlier protest movements.\n\nBut the NEA and the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, the Democratic Party\u2019s state legislative campaign arm, said before Tuesday\u2019s vote that the number of teachers pursuing office had increased from previous electoral cycles. A DLCC spokesperson said before the election that it had counted more than 1,200 educators running for office as Democrats in 2018, an increase of roughly 200 from two years ago.\n\nNot all of those included in the NEA or DLCC counts are teachers. The union used a broad definition to compile the numbers, counting current and former classroom teachers and professors at the K-12 and postsecondary levels, as well as candidates who had worked as administrative or support staff in schools, districts and universities. Many of them were incumbents, and the vast majority of the candidates ran as Democrats. But more than 400 candidates included in the initial count sought office as Republicans, according to the union\u2019s data.\n\nStates like Kentucky, where teachers walked out of schools amid pension reforms and budget cuts in the spring, saw a record number of educators run for office this year. Fourteen of those 51 teachers and educators vying for office won Tuesday, according to the Louisville Courier-Journal.\n\nEducators won other high-profile victories that were not included in the NEA\u2019s list, which only counted state legislative races. Jahana Hayes, a former National Teacher of the Year, won a U.S. congressional seat in Connecticut. U.S. Rep. Tim Walz, a former high school geography teacher, won Minnesota\u2019s gubernatorial race. And former school superintendent Tony Evers beat Gov. Scott Walker (R) \u2015 a longtime target of teachers and unions \u2015 to become Wisconsin\u2019s next governor.\n\nVoters in Arizona also rejected a ballot measure that would have expanded the state\u2019s education voucher program.\n\nUnion leaders said this week that they were also encouraged by victories for candidates like Gretchen Whitmer and Michelle Lujan Grisham, who won gubernatorial contests in Michigan and New Mexico, respectively. Both ran on pro-public education platforms.\n\nNEA leaders said this week that they hoped the success of educators could help shift debates around funding for public education and teacher pay across the nation, especially after teacher walkouts in West Virginia, Kentucky, Arizona, and Oklahoma turned attention to cuts to education budgets in those states and elsewhere.", "Charles Sykes/Invision/AP Michelle Obama talked about her own infertility issues in her new book, Becoming .\n\nIn her new memoir, Becoming, former first lady Michelle Obama talks frankly about the infertility, the miscarriage and the IVF treatments that she and husband Barack Obama experienced before becoming parents.\n\nAdvocates have immediately praised Obama\u2019s sharing of her story as a milestone for infertility awareness and the breaking down of shame and silence around the inability to conceive or give birth to a child.\n\nThe news is especially poignant for women of color, who experience infertility at higher rates than the general population while being the least likely to seek medical help.\n\nIn an interview with ABC\u2019s Robin Roberts about her memoir, Obama said that she wanted to share her infertility experience to spread the truth about how bodies work \u2015 and don\u2019t work.\n\n\u201cI felt lost and alone, and I felt like I failed,\u201d she told Roberts about her miscarriage. \u201cBecause I didn\u2019t know how common miscarriages were. Because we don\u2019t talk about it. We sit in our own pain, thinking that somehow we\u2019re broken.\u201d\n\nAfter that miscarriage, she and her husband went on to conceive their two daughters, Malia and Sasha, through in vitro fertilization \u2015 a medical procedure in which eggs are extracted from a woman\u2019s ovaries and fertilized with sperm in a laboratory to create embryos. If viable embryos are created, they are transferred back into the woman\u2019s body to establish a pregnancy.\n\nObama hinted in the ABC interview that the couple turned to IVF due to an issue with egg quality.\n\n\u201cThe biological clock is real because egg production is limited,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I realized that as I was 34 and 35 \u2015 we had to do IVF.\u201d\n\nAdvocates for people facing infertility problems say that the revelation from one of the most admired women in America will help others feel less alone.\n\nThe Rev. Dr. Stacey Edwards-Dunn, founder of the education and advocacy organization Fertility for Colored Girls, said that Obama\u2019s disclosure could give hope to other women of color who may be struggling alone with their infertility.\n\n\u201cSo many black women [and] couples live in silence and shame for so many reasons, including myths and misconceptions about black women being hyper-fertile,\u201d Edwards-Dunn said. \u201c[Michelle Obama] just gave so many women permission to exhale and say, \u2018I\u2019m not alone, and I too can get support and help to become a parent!\u2019\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s story will open up more conversations about infertility and black women, said Edwards-Dunn, who has gone through seven IVF cycles herself and now has a 4-year-old child conceived from the treatments.\n\n\u201cNot only is this the first time that we hear of a first lady being so transparent about her personal fertility challenges, but her courageous truth-telling gives more women, particularly black women and couples, the courage to talk about their own challenges,\u201d she said.\n\nDr. Aaron Styer, an African-American reproductive endocrinologist and founding partner of the fertility clinic CCRM Boston, said this could encourage more couples to visit a doctor.\n\n\u201cAs one of the most respected and revered women of color, Michelle Obama\u2019s openness to discuss her IVF treatments will open that dialogue and empower black women and all women, men, and couples facing infertility to seek these treatments to conceive,\u201d he said.\n\nBarbara Collura, president of the infertility advocacy group RESOLVE, similarly hopes that Obama\u2019s news might inspire others to act.\n\n\u201cThe day-to-day impact really happens when people who care about this issue talk to their employers about adding family building benefits to help them, when they talk to their lawmakers about policy change, and when we as a community make sure that anyone struggling to build a family has access to information and support,\u201d said Collura.\n\nInfertility can strike all races, ethnicities and economic groups. Overall, about 12 percent of women in the U.S. have problems either getting pregnant or carrying a pregnancy to term.\n\nBut black women have higher rates of infertility (defined as unprotected sex with a man for more than one year without a pregnancy) and higher rates of pregnancy loss between 10 and 20 weeks gestation. The cause may be a complex mix of medical issues including higher rates of fibroids, obesity, and blocked fallopian tubes \u2015 all factors that can affect fertility, said Styer.\n\nBlack women are also less likely than other groups to seek medical help for infertility. A 2015 study surveying 300 reproductive-age women with infertility found that black women were less likely to visit a doctor for help getting pregnant and that they waited twice as long as white women before seeking help.\n\nResearchers say this is the result of both cultural and practical barriers to medical care. There is some evidence that black women in particular feel they can\u2019t reach out for support and experience shame about their condition because of the expectation (and stigma) that black women are especially fertile.\n\nBut the most significant problem may be rooted in more practical concerns: Black women trying to get infertility treatment say it\u2019s more difficult for them to get doctor\u2019s appointments, take time off from work and pay for treatment.\n\nIVF is a common medical treatment, and more than one million babies have been born in the U.S. thanks to the technology. But most people who have fertility issues will never be able to access this or other treatments. Among women interviewed for the 2006\u20132010 National Survey of Family Growth, only 3.1 percent of those with fertility issues had ever used assisted reproductive technology like IVF.\n\nThis could be because the average couple going through IVF will spend more than $24,000 in an 18-month period. And this is likely to be an out-of-pocket cost, as infertility treatment is generally not covered by insurance.\n\nEven when black women are able to seek help, the best treatments that medical science has for infertility don\u2019t seem to work as well with them. A study of about 4,000 women undergoing their first IVF cycle found that black women had lower odds of achieving a pregnancy and a live birth compared to white women, along with higher rates of miscarriage.\n\nStill, fingers are crossed that Obama\u2019s disclosure will at least drive more women of color to consult with fertility clinics \u2015 just as Angelina Jolie\u2019s 2013 New York Times op-ed caused a spike in genetic testing for breast cancer.", "The Season 13 finale of FXX\u2019s \u201cIt\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia\u201d will be remembered for a much-buzzed-about contemporary dance sequence that not only stopped the show, but also represented a principal character coming out to his father as a gay man.\n\nThough Mac (played by Rob McElhenney) was revealed to be gay last season, he kept his sexuality from his father, Luther (Gregory Scott Cummins).\n\nTitled \u201cMac Finds His Pride,\u201d Wednesday\u2019s episode saw Mac telling Luther, \u201cDad, I\u2019m gay,\u201d before stripping off his shirt and launching into a rain-soaked pas de deux with ballerina Kylie Shea.\n\nWatch the full scene below.\n\nMcElhenney, who is also the show\u2019s creator, told Vulture he wanted to express his character\u2019s inner turmoil through the number and worked with choreographers Alison Faulk and Leo Moctezuma for several hours daily to perfect his moves.\n\nNoting that the show received \u201coverwhelming emotional response from the LGBTQ community\u201d when Mac came out as gay in an episode that aired last year, McElhenney said, \u201cI took it seriously and I felt it would be completely unexpected to have this much more emotionally resonant end to the season.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love cannot be killed or swept aside\u201d \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd\ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08 Still overcome w/emotion.

But nothing is normal about Georgia\u2019s race for governor.\n\nAbrams, who would be the first black female governor in the history of the nation, had to devote an enormous amount of energy during her campaign to fighting the voter suppression tactics of her opponent, who refused to resign his position as secretary of state to run for governor and therefore oversaw his own election. Kemp now holds 50.33 percent of the vote to Abrams\u2019 48.72, and a candidate in Georgia has to win at least 50 percent to win the race outright.\n\nAbrams maintains that the hundreds of thousands of people Kemp allegedly blocked from the polls could easily push her to victory, or at least a runoff.\n\nThere were numerous accounts of voting difficulties in Georgia on Tuesday \u2015 particularly for people of color. Voters were denied a ballot and turned away from the polls because they hadn\u2019t voted in the last three years and/or the last two federal elections, and Kemp\u2019s office had purged hundreds of thousands of people from the rolls for \u201cinactivity.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press reported that Kemp\u2019s office put 53,000 voter registration applications on hold \u2015 70 percent of them from people of color \u2015 because of the state\u2019s controversial \u201cexact match\u201d law.\n\nVoters in Gwinnett County, a diverse swing district north of Atlanta where Abrams canvassers had focused their turnout efforts, were forced to wait hours in line because the voting machines lacked power cords and ran out of batteries.\n\nAbrams\u2019 campaign held a press conference Friday with Georgia voters who said they were blocked from the polls for various reasons. One person said she never received the absentee ballot she requested, despite calling the voter hotline for help. Another said she was turned away from her polling place, despite being registered to vote there, because they wouldn\u2019t accept her valid out-of-state ID. Others said they were forced to go to second and sometimes third polling places because theirs were experiencing technical difficulties.\n\nThe Abrams campaign also charges that tens of thousands of outstanding ballots have not been counted \u2015 particularly provisional and absentee ballots.

He said officials performing the count do not have the necessary training to match signatures, and that similar laws in other states have been thrown out.\n\nHe added that he is confident Nelson has a good chance of winning if a full count is conducted because of his experience in handling recounts and how many votes seem to be missing from South Florida. Once the recounts are underway, though, there\u2019s nothing anyone can do to affect the tally, he said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can do about that.

You cannot say that!\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s sad because the movie is great,\u201d he added. \u201cThe irony is confounding, to be honest \u2014 it\u2019s really shocking, and it was really shocking in the moment.\u201d\n\nMortensen later released a statement to IndieWire apologizing for using the slur:\n\nIn making the point that many people casually used the \u2018N\u2019 word at the time in which the movie story takes place, in 1962, I used the full word. Although my intention was to speak strongly against racism, I have no right to even imagine the hurt that is caused by hearing that word in any context, especially from a white man. I do not use the word in private or in public. I am very sorry that I did use the full word last night, and will not utter it again.", "The White House has been the source of so much comedy lately that one comedian is taking it as an invasion of his professional arena.

What can fans expect from your performance?\n\nIt\u2019s different than a typical concert, because it\u2019s hosted by Seth Rudetsky. It\u2019s basically an opportunity to get out onstage with him. You sing songs, and then he interviews you, and you sit and talk about your life. You\u2019re never quite sure what he\u2019s going to ask you, and you\u2019re never quite sure what you\u2019re going to sing. He has lists of stuff, and he just decides when and where and what. It keeps you on your toes, but because it\u2019s Seth, you end up having a great time. I love the spontaneity of it.\n\nSo many performers have a deep relationship with Seth. What do you enjoy most about working with him?\n\nSeth and I have an almost 30-year argument about when we met. I think it was the summer of 1989. He says it was the summer of \u201990. We\u2019ve known each other for decades and came up in the business together. I married [actor Will Swenson] about two weeks before Seth married [actor-playwright James Wesley]. We both have kids the same age.

We all understand we\u2019re in bumpy times now and there are bumpy times ahead. We have to stay awake, vigilant and active in our democracy so that it can continue to be a democracy. Nobody can fall asleep at the wheel right now. I stay active [because] I\u2019ve got children I want to raise the right way and in a country that I believe in and that believes in them as well.

Why was that appearance so special for you?\n\nI think the art of drag is exactly that \u2014 an art. You need such talent to do drag, and you have to be multitalented. Most of the time, they\u2019re creating their own costumes, they\u2019re writing their own material, they can sing, they can dance, they have to be comedic. It\u2019s a true art form that I could never do in a million years, so I respect it deeply. To be able to be a part of promoting that art form and putting in my two cents about what I thought about it \u2014 which I felt completely unqualified to do \u2014 it was something I just had to do.\n\nAlso, I love RuPaul. I\u2019ve known Mama Ru for many years. The night I won my Tony for playing Billie Holiday [in \u201cLady Day at Emerson\u2019s Bar and Grill\u201d in 2014], he was backstage. He just looked at me and bowed \u2014 this beautifully dramatic, curtsy-style bow, which was so sweet. It was wild. I just love him, so when they asked, of course I wanted to do it.\n\nIs there one artistic realm you\u2019re dying to have a crack at?\n\nNot really.

If the signature on the voter registration doesn\u2019t match that on the sealed envelope, both Maricopa and Pima County allow voters to help them fix, or \u201ccure\u201d it, up to five days after Election Day.\n\nMany other counties only allow voters to cure until polls close on Election Day.\n\nOnly a few thousand votes would be affected by the suit, but every one counts in the razor-close U.S. Senate race between Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema and Republican Rep. Martha McSally. On Thursday, Sinema jumped into a minuscule lead of about 9,000 out of 1.9 million votes counted after trailing since Tuesday. Her lead came from the two counties singled out by Republicans in their lawsuit, Maricopa and Pima Counties.\n\nThe race remained too close to call with at least 400,000 ballots still uncounted. Maricopa County Recorder Adrian Fontes said counting may continue until Nov. 15. \u201cWe know there\u2019s urgency out there, but we want to get it right, not quick,\u201d he said.\n\nArizona is notoriously slow at tallying ballots even though about 75 percent of votes are cast by mail. Each of those ballots must go through a laborious verification process.\n\nIf the signature on the envelope does not match the signature on the voter file, elections officials can contact the voter to try to resolve the discrepancy. Such situations arise, for example, when voters have Parkinson\u2019s disease and can no longer sign as they did in the past or as their signature changes over the years.\n\nThe GOP lawsuit centers on that \u201ccure\u201d process. It asks that the judge either stop Maricopa and Pima from contacting voters to fix their ballots after Election Day or permit the rest of the state to do it. At least two other rural counties also allow post-Election Day \u201ccures\u201d but several others do not.\n\nDemocrats contended that the GOP is trying to prevent votes from being counted. \u201cThe Republican Party is doing everything it can to silence thousands of Arizonans who already cast their ballots,\u201d Democratic Party chairwoman Felicia Rotellini said in a statement.\n\nGOP attorney Brett Johnson said in an interview the party would be happy if the end result is the rural counties are ordered to extend their cure period and more votes are counted. \u201cAt the end of the day, each vote should be treated the same way,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nThe state\u2019s junior Republican Senator, Jon Kyl, issued a statement trying to frame the lawsuit as a question of equal protection rather than limiting urban vote counting. \u201cEvery single lawful vote in Arizona should be counted,\u201d Kyl said. \u201cAnd voting laws in our state should be applied uniformly across the map.\u201d\n\nAt a brief hearing Thursday, a Maricopa County official said only about 5,600 ballots are at issue in her county and the rate is similar in the 14 smaller counties. More than 2.2 million votes were cast statewide.\n\nThere were more than 600,000 mail-in ballots left to process statewide as of Wednesday, about 75 percent in Maricopa County. That huge amount has put pressure on a system that spends a lot of time already verifying the mail ballot signatures.\n\nFontes said his office\u2019s 1980s-era computer system is partly to blame. It was put in when Maricopa was far smaller and only a handful of its residents voted by mail.\n\nHe said the system only allows his office to tally about 75,000 votes a day. There are another 375,000 votes outstanding in Maricopa County alone as of Thursday night.\n\nThe two Senate campaigns have long braced for a slow vote count. McSally is no stranger to the issue. It took The Associated Press 12 days to declare a winner in McSally\u2019s first race for Congress, which she narrowly lost in 2012.\n\nOn Thursday, she tweeted: \u201cWoke up this morning dreading a long and painful process. I\u2019ve been here before, and now, here I am again.the dentist\u2019s chair.\u201d She attached a photo of herself leaning back at the dentist\u2019s office, about to get her teeth examined.", "Josh McCall lost his congressional race on Tuesday. It wasn\u2019t even close.\n\nMcCall, a Democrat, received just 21 percent of the vote against the incumbent, Rep. Doug Collins (R), in Georgia\u2019s 9th District.\n\nBut you know what? McCall is feeling fine. In fact, he feels like his race was a success.\n\n\u201cThe ground results were great. Canvassing was amazing,\u201d McCall said.\n\nMcCall received almost 58,000 votes. The last time Collins had a challenger, in 2014, the Democratic candidate received only 35,000 votes.\n\nGeorgia\u2019s 9th District is one of the reddest in the country. No one thought McCall had a shot at winning. But across the country this cycle, political novices like McCall stepped up and ran for office or became involved in organizing in districts that the Democratic Party has traditionally written off.\n\nAnd that strategy paid off. In Oklahoma, Democrat Kendra Horn flipped the state\u2019s 5th Congressional District in one of the biggest upsets of Tuesday night. In Kansas, Democrat Laura Kelly will be in the governor\u2019s mansion next year.\n\nAt the state level, Democrats flipped more than 300 state legislative seats and will likely control a majority of the attorney general\u2019s offices in the country. The blue wave was real.\n\nBut even in places where they lost, Democrats believe they came out ahead. Having candidates run matters.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t blame the people at the top if the people on the bottom aren\u2019t working,\u201d McCall said. \u201cSo one of the reasons I jumped in is because I thought, \u2018Why do Democrats always abandon districts like this?\u2019 Then I had to tell myself honestly that it\u2019s because Democrats like me in districts like this don\u2019t get out and work.\u201d\n\nThis is not the 50-state strategy. This is the people in the 50 states deciding they\u2019re not going to wait for change from Washington \u2015 which rarely occurs \u2015 and they\u2019re going to force change. Howard Dean\n\nWhen candidates run, at any level, work happens. They update voter files and register new voters. They also have conversations with voters who \u2015 if they live in a place without competitive races \u2015 may not hear from their politicians very much.\n\n\u201cMaybe they\u2019re talking to Republicans and independents and having conversations that short-term, may not come out ahead, but long-term will do more for the Democratic brand because there will be a person attached to the name of the party rather than just this idea,\u201d said Amanda Litman, co-founder of Run for Something, which recruits and supports Democrats running for down-ballot offices.\n\nThe 2016 elections were a shot in the arm for complacent Democrats. Groups like Indivisible, Swing Left and Run for Something popped up, driven by a bottom-up structure that focused on activism in local communities. People who weren\u2019t involved in politics started looking for an outlet, with many of them reinvigorating Democratic organizations in their towns.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening to us is absolutely fascinating,\u201d said Howard Dean, the former Democratic National Committee chairman who famously implemented a 50-state strategy and refused to concede any place as \u201cunwinnable\u201d for the party.\n\n\u201cThis is not something that\u2019s coming from the top down,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is not the 50-state strategy. This is the people in the 50 states deciding they\u2019re not going to wait for change from Washington \u2015 which rarely occurs \u2015 and they\u2019re going to force change. They\u2019re going to do it their way. And I think it\u2019s been great.\u201d\n\nIn Georgia\u2019s Hall County, McCall said the Democratic Party there almost disbanded because there were so few people coming to the meetings. But once Trump was elected, the party grew.\n\nIlene Johnson, the communications chair for the Gwinnett County Democratic Party in Georgia, has been involved in local politics since 2010. At its first meeting after 2016, it didn\u2019t even have a headquarters, so members rented a room in the old city hall.\n\n\u201cLet me just say \u2015 if the fire marshal had come by, he would\u2019ve closed us down because we were just at capacity. So much more involvement [since then],\u201d she said. \u201cMy work has tripled.\u201d\n\nJohnson said she was \u201cvery happy\u201d with Tuesday\u2019s results. Sure, the governor\u2019s race is possibly headed to a runoff. But at the county level, there were less-noticed Democratic victories.\n\nKate Howard Franch, the chairwoman of the Democratic Party in Greenville, South Carolina, was also feeling good this week. She pointed out five new candidates who ran for the statehouse. All of them lost \u2015 but the fact that a diverse group of newcomers had decided to run was a big deal in that traditionally red area.\n\n\u201cWe saw a lot of people we\u2019ve never seen before, and we had a number of people come in and say, \u2018I haven\u2019t traditionally voted for Democrats, but I\u2019m going to this cycle.\u2019 And not only that, they were coming in to get a yard sign for the governor\u2019s race. ... The fact that they were willing to stake that in their yard was really impressive to us and says a lot about what is changing here,\u201d Franch said.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Rep. Beto O'Rourke (D-Texas) generated huge levels of enthusiasm nationwide for his run for Senate.\n\nWhile having on-the-ground engagement is essential to win big races, having a strong candidate at the top of the ticket matters too. Texas was a key example. Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (D) was always a long shot to win the Senate race. The national party wasn\u2019t going to invest its time and money there when it had so many other seats to defend. So O\u2019Rourke looked to the grassroots.\n\nO\u2019Rourke raised a stunning, record-breaking amount of money \u2015 $38 million, just from July to October. To put that in perspective, it\u2019s more money that Jeb Bush raised during his entire 2016 presidential run. And O\u2019Rourke did it without taking any money from political action committees, instead relying on hundreds of thousands of small-dollar donations.\n\nO\u2019Rourke lost, yes. But he fell within 2.7 percentage points of Sen. Ted Cruz (R), outperforming expectations.\n\n\u201cIt was money well spent,\u201d said Carisa Lopez, who now works for a progressive nonprofit in Texas and previously served as the executive director of the Travis County Democratic Party.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re ever going to become a progressive state and we\u2019re going to elect progressive candidates, we have to put resources into building infrastructure,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s exactly what happened. We\u2019re seeing a lot of organizations on the ground doing the work, along with Beto\u2019s campaign.\u201d\n\nShe also credited the O\u2019Rourke campaign for recognizing that there were groups, like Battleground Texas, that were already doing work year-round \u2015 and worked with those organizations.\n\n\u201cI was disappointed that Beto didn\u2019t get us over the finish line, but I was absolutely inspired by the 254-county strategy that he put into place. And that foundation is going to enable us to expand the electorate,\u201d said Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez.\n\nHaving a candidate who generated so much enthusiasm paid dividends down the ballot. Democrats closed the margin in the governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general races. They also won two key House races, throwing out longtime GOP incumbents. And in Harris County, the largest county in Texas, 19 black women who ran for judicial seats all won their races.\n\nEven in other places where particularly controversial GOP members were re-elected, Democrats felt like they had done something big by challenging them and exposing their records and rhetoric.\n\nRep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.) represents New York\u2019s reddest district and was considered a shoo-in for re-election. But when he was indicted on insider trading charges, the seat suddenly became a target for Democrats. And the party was lucky it just happened to have a candidate. Nate McMurray, a town supervisor, decided to run on the Democratic side, even though no one gave him a shot at winning. He, however, gave the Democrats a chance to take the seat. (Many outlets have declared the race for Collins, but McMurray is demanding a recount.)\n\nRep. Steve King (R-Iowa), a white nationalist, won a ninth term to Congress on Tuesday. But during the campaign, he faced increased scrutiny over his racist positions.\n\n\u201cThis district was supposed to be impossible, but the district swung 20 POINTS and King got wrestled to an almost tie in the most competitive race he\u2019s ever faced,\u201d said a progressive activist in Iowa who asked not to be named for fear of retribution from King\u2019s campaign. \u201cThis should be a source of pride and hope.\u201d\n\n\u201cKing will be even more of an isolated pariah in Congress and in his party, with even less power over the next two years,\u201d he added. \u201cRepublicans will either primary him to lance the festering, infected boil that is Steve King and/or now that we know the race can be closed, focused resources and attention will pour in that King won\u2019t be able to match. I\u2019m confident this is Steve King\u2019s last win.\u201d", "WASHINGTON \u2015 Hours before he resigned as the nation\u2019s 84th attorney general, Jeff Sessions signed a memo that sharply curtailed the ability of the federal government\u2019s civil rights attorneys to rein in unconstitutional policing.\n\nThe Justice Department announced on Thursday evening that Sessions, prior to his departure on Wednesday, had signed a memo that effectively eliminates the use of so-called consent decrees, the court-enforceable agreements that the Obama administration had used to curtail patterns of police abuse in cities like Ferguson, Missouri, and Baltimore.\n\nSessions has long been a skeptic of the \u201cpattern or practice\u201d investigations of local police departments, which, he said during his confirmation hearing, \u201cundermine respect for police officers\u201d by creating the impression that an \u201centire department is not doing their work consistent with fidelity to law and fairness.\u201d After he became attorney general, Sessions conceded that he\u2019d never read the high-profile investigations conducted by the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division, but nevertheless believed they were \u201cpretty anecdotal, and not so scientifically based.\u201d\n\nIn his Nov. 7 memo, Sessions told DOJ litigators to use \u201cspecial caution\u201d before entering into consent decree agreements he called \u201cextraordinary remedies\u201d that should be used sparingly. The memo lays out the narrow circumstances under which DOJ can enter into a consent decree and requires the explicit approval of politically appointed officials to enter into such agreements.\n\n\u201cJust as it would be extraordinary for a federal agency to consent to the use of a monitor to oversee its operations or policies, in most cases there is little reason to expect or require a state or local government, equally a democratically accountable entity, to do so,\u201d Sessions wrote.\n\nBut many of the local governments that have entered into consent decrees with DOJ were headed by political leaders who wanted to reach a court-enforced agreement because they can help force change in police departments with deep-seated opposition to police reform.\n\nChristy E. Lopez, a former Justice Department official who helped pioneer DOJ\u2019s approach to police misconduct and who oversaw the federal investigation into the Ferguson Police Department, said that Sessions\u2019 memo would make it more difficult for people who want change to get it.\n\n\u201cWe have a long history in this country of recognizing that sometimes you need to circumvent democratic processes,\u201d Lopez told HuffPost. \u201cWhether you go back to Federalist Paper No. 51, protecting people from the tyranny of the majority \u2015 that\u2019s why we have courts \u2015 or footnote four, that courts have a special obligation to protect discrete and insular minorities from intrusion on their rights.\u201d\n\nLopez said that the publicity about the memo will put employees within the special litigation section of the Civil Rights Division in a frail litigating position.\n\n\u201cThe fact that they\u2019re putting it out there for all the public to see completely weakens the position of Special Litigation, not only in future cases but their current cases,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cYou can\u2019t even pretend like you have any authority anymore, you don\u2019t have any ability to do anything.\u201d\n\nVanita Gupta, who headed the Civil Rights Division in the Obama era, said that the memo was \u201canother attack on the core mission\u201d of the Department of Justice and amounted to \u201ca slap in the face to the dedicated career staff\u201d in DOJ\u2019s Civil Rights Division.\n\n\u201cThe memo is designed to restrict consent decrees and creates a series of increasingly higher roadblocks to render them rare and ineffective,\u201d said Gupta, who now heads the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights.\n\n\u201cConsent decrees are a necessary, careful tool to ensure entities such as schools, employers, and law enforcement remedy patterns and practices of unconstitutional conduct. These agreements have judicial oversight and are used only when there is clear, overwhelming, and well documented evidence.

In fact, Long appears to have had the very sort of red flags in his past that might have been used to keep him away from firearms under a 2014 California law. Authorities haven\u2019t released the full details of Long\u2019s prior involvement with law enforcement, so we don\u2019t yet know why the law wasn\u2019t used. It\u2019s only clear that it wasn\u2019t.\n\nLong, a 29-year-old U.S. Marine Corps veteran, lived with his mother in a ranch-style house five miles from the Borderline Bar, the site of Wednesday\u2019s shooting. Neighbors reported loud arguments coming from the home over the past year, and said Long could sometimes be heard kicking holes in the wall.\n\nAcquaintances said Long had post-traumatic stress disorder, though it\u2019s not clear whether he ever received a formal diagnosis of PTSD. His mother was reportedly frustrated that he wasn\u2019t getting help. Long was also known as a gun owner, and officials said Thursday that he\u2019d carried out the shooting with a legally owned semiautomatic handgun. One neighbor said he believed he heard gunshots coming from Long\u2019s property more than a year ago.\n\nIn April, deputies with the Ventura County Sheriff\u2019s Office were summoned to Long\u2019s house to handle a domestic dispute. Police have said little other than that Long was \u201csomewhat irate and acting irrationally,\u201d according to Ventura County Sheriff Geoff Dean.\n\nDeputies requested a crisis intervention team and a mental health specialist, who determined Long was not \u201cqualified to be taken under 5150,\u201d said Dean, referring to the California code that allows authorities to involuntarily commit individuals for evaluation when they are found to present a danger due to mental illness. People subject to 5150 holds are generally barred from possessing or acquiring firearms for five years.\n\nDavid McNew via Getty Images A man waves a flag in Thousand Oaks, California, as a Ventura County Sheriff's patrol car passes. Deputies visited the suspected gunman's home in April.\n\nWhile Long was determined not to qualify for a 5150, there was another option to get guns away from him. Because 5150s are used only in the most extreme cases, California passed another law in 2014, following a deadly shooting spree in Isla Vista, intended to temporarily remove guns from people who pose a danger to themselves or others. California is now one of more than a dozen states with these so-called \u201cred flag\u201d laws on the books.\n\nJust weeks before the Isla Vista shooter went on his rampage, his family called police to check in on him. After finding him \u201ccourteous and polite,\u201d officers decided it wouldn\u2019t be appropriate to issue a 5150 hold, even though he\u2019d posted videos online expressing a desire to commit violence against women. Advocates of the red flag law fought successfully for the creation of another tool to get guns away from potentially dangerous people, even if their behavior might not technically be the result of a mental health crisis.\n\n\u201cWhen a person doesn\u2019t qualify for a 5150 or that doesn\u2019t seem appropriate, this is another option for disarming them,\u201d said Amanda Wilcox, legislative chair of the California chapters of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence.\n\nUnder California\u2019s red flag law, family members, roommates and law enforcement officers can petition the court to remove firearms from individuals who have displayed violent behavior. A judge will then hold a hearing to review evidence and decide whether to order the gun owner to surrender their firearms and stay away from all guns. Those restraining orders can last up to a year, and can be extended further based on additional evidence.\n\nAdvocates of red flag laws often point to encounters like the one Long had with police in April as opportunities for law enforcement to intervene and petition for a gun violence restraining order.\n\n\u201cIf they\u2019d used it, it sounds like they could\u2019ve done a successful petition,\u201d Wilcox said.\n\nAuthorities haven\u2019t said why such a restraining order wasn\u2019t obtained. But Wilcox suggested a few possibilities. Deputies with the sheriff\u2019s office may not have understood how this process works, or perhaps weren\u2019t aware of the law, which has only been in effect since 2016. Alternatively, they might have known about it but determined that petitioning for a restraining order wouldn\u2019t have been appropriate given what they knew about Long. It\u2019s even possible that officers did file a petition for a gun violence restraining order, only to have it rejected by a judge.\n\nThere\u2019s also the question of whether officers knew Long was in possession of a gun in April. When law enforcement is called to respond to a domestic dispute, they\u2019re supposed to check the California firearms database to see if the person has a gun registered to them, Wilcox said. It\u2019s not clear if they did that.\n\n\u201cThese are hard calls,\u201d Wilcox said. \u201cI don\u2019t know all the details and I\u2019m not trying to be blatantly critical of law enforcement, but it looks like [the gun violence restraining order] might have been a tool that could\u2019ve saved lives.\u201d\n\nThe Ventura County Sheriff\u2019s Office did not respond to a request for comment on how the department uses the state\u2019s red flag law.\n\nBut the data suggests police in Ventura County make use of this tool only rarely. Between 2016 and 2017, just four gun violence restraining orders were filed in the county, according to data from the California Department of Justice obtained by HuffPost. The state attorney general\u2019s office did not immediately respond to a request for more recent data.\n\nThere is a large problem of agencies not being well-informed or well-trained on this law. Allison Anderman, Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence\n\nIn other counties, including Los Angeles, San Diego and Santa Barbara, gun violence restraining orders were filed far more frequently. That may make sense in counties with larger populations, but Santa Barbara only has about half as many people as Ventura. Advocates of red flag laws say some departments have simply been slow to adopt the process.\n\n\u201cWhat we are seeing in the state is there is a large problem of agencies not being well-informed or well-trained on this law,\u201d said Allison Anderman, managing attorney of the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.\n\nThe biggest issue with California\u2019s red flag law, its supporters say, is that many law enforcement officials and residents of the state don\u2019t know these tools are available to them. Advocates like Anderman and Wilcox are working hard to educate agencies about the value of gun violence restraining orders. Organizations like Speak for Safety also provide resources to family members who may be in volatile situations that could call for such petitions.\n\nThe slow pace of progress has been especially frustrating for Wilcox. In 2001, her 19-year-old daughter Laura was killed when a mentally ill man entered the clinic where she was working and opened fire. Two others were slain in an ensuing shooting spree, and three more were injured.\n\nThe gunman had been visited by mental health personnel numerous times before the shooting, but they never found cause to commit him under the state\u2019s 5150 statute \u2015 which meant he wasn\u2019t prohibited from gun ownership.\n\n\u201cPeople with mental illness are not stupid,\u201d Wilcox said. \u201cHe could hold it together for the evaluation.\u201d\n\nCalifornia\u2019s red flag law was designed specifically for cases like his and Long\u2019s, according to Wilcox.", "A video posted Thursday by The Warp Zone just added clever lyrics to the \u201cHarry Potter\u201d song.

Those started at the very top of their political arm with the National Republican Campaign Committee and went all the way down to small but consequential decisions in individual races.\n\nThe decisions have baffled other Republican strategists, and set off a wave of finger-pointing at NRCC Chairman Steve Stivers and one of his top lieutenants, John Rogers.\n\n\u201cAnyone who knows how party committees are supposed to be run would be incredibly disappointed with the committee this cycle, and especially Stivers,\u201d said one former top NRCC aide.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know a single Republican group that thinks the NRCC did their job this cycle,\u201d said a GOP consultant with close ties to the White House.\n\nWhat\u2019s irking Republicans is a number of recruitment failures, strategic decisions and questionable spending moves \u2015 the most questionable of which was giving $5 million to doomed Republican Rep. Barbara Comstock of Virginia.\n\nHillary Clinton won Comstock\u2019s district by 10 points in 2016, and Democratic Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam improved on that margin in the 2017 governor\u2019s race. The suburban, diverse, affluent, educated composition of the electorate was ripe for a Democratic pickup. Republicans knew that. And yet, it looks like the NRCC spent more on defending that seat than any other \u2015 a seat it ended up losing by 12 points.\n\nTo put that $5 million decision in context, that\u2019s more money than what the NRCC spent on all the California Republicans in tough races combined \u2015 and there were almost a dozen close races in California.\n\nRepublicans may end up holding on to most of those seats, or about half of them, depending on how the late ballots come in. But we already know at least two members have lost in extraordinarily close fashion in California: Dana Rohrabacher and Steve Knight, with Jeff Denham, Mimi Walters and Young Kim also looking shaky.\n\nAt this point, you\u2019d be hard-pressed to find a GOP strategist who thinks putting $5 million into Comstock\u2019s race was a good idea when you could have put that money into California. But you would have also had difficulty finding many strategists outside of the NRCC who thought such a decision was good at basically any point during the cycle.\n\nCorry Bliss, the head of the House GOP\u2019s super PAC, never put money into the race, seemingly believing it was a lost cause. Meanwhile, the NRCC communications director was on Fox News on Election Day touting the belief that Comstock could win.\n\nThe NRCC also spent lavishly on Colorado Rep. Mike Coffman, another Republican in a district that Clinton won by 10 points. Coffman ended up losing by 9 points. And the committee chased after a mirage seat in Florida, one that was represented by retiring Republican Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen. That district went for Clinton by an astounding 19 points, but the NRCC thought the Democrat vying for the open seat, Donna Shalala was weak, so it poured $1.5 million into the race only to lose by 8 points.\n\nDemocratic strategists think the money was an attempt to distract from districts slipping away from the GOP, a shiny golden ring it was never going to get.\n\n\u201cIt was a $1.5 million talking point,\u201d said Tyler Law, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee\u2019s national press secretary.\n\nIn an adjacent district in Florida held by GOP Rep. Carlos Curbelo, the NRCC booked a large ad buy in July \u2015 campaign committees typically book airtime in expensive districts over the summer to get cheaper rates. It then canceled the buy in September, only to rebook it a day later. The switcheroo cost the campaign committee $600,000 because of the higher cost closer to the election.\n\n\u201cYou know who could\u2019ve used $600,000? Karen Handel and Mia Love,\u201d the former NRCC aide said, referring to two Republicans who were vastly outspent and narrowly lost their seats.\n\nStill, the NRCC believes its efforts tamped down a blue wave.\n\n\u201cWe stand behind our decisions and are proud of our record fundraising and spending,\u201d NRCC communications director Matt Gorman told HuffPost. \u201cOur efforts were crucial at mitigating losses in a tough environment.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post via Getty Images Rep. Barbara Comstock (R-Va.) delivers her concession speech after being defeated by state Sen. Jennifer Wexton (D) in Virginia's 10th District race. The NRCC spent $5 million on Comstock, confounding many Republican strategists.\n\nIt\u2019s true that it was a tough environment for Republicans. President Donald Trump\u2019s unpopularity was probably always going to lead to Democratic pickups. Democrats will win the popular vote for the House by about 7 points, and when everything shakes out, they\u2019ll hold between 53 and 54 percent of House seats, meaning they\u2019ll have converted their small electoral advantage incredibly efficiently, despite natural geographic disadvantages and gerrymandering.\n\nDemocrats did about as well as they could in converting their votes to seats.\n\nOf course, Democrats also spent millions on a number of seats they didn\u2019t flip. The DCCC touts that it spent at least $100,000 on 80 seats, trying to build the largest battlefield possible, but that also means it gave to dozens of failed candidates.\n\nThe DCCC counters that its spending on losing candidates vastly paled in comparison to the amounts it gave to winning candidates, and that its spending was about putting Republicans on defense, not the other way around.\n\n\u201cWe have the best polling and analytics team in the country, and that allowed us to make efficient spending decisions,\u201d Law told HuffPost.\n\nBut Law and Meredith Kelly, the DCCC\u2019s communications director, touted much more than their spending successes and the NRCC\u2019s failures. As much flak as the DCCC took for playing in primaries, the committee ultimately thinks its endorsements and spending in the California primaries \u2015 where the jungle system can potentially lock out a Democrat if the candidate is not a top-two vote-getter \u2015 were crucial.\n\nWhile the NRCC has a hard rule against endorsing and giving to candidates in primaries for open seats, Bliss\u2019 group, the Congressional Leadership Fund, threatened to get into the California primaries and make trouble for Democrats. Instead, the group sat it out. The DCCC thought that was a misstep, pointing to how a small amount of money during the primary can pay dividends later with a stronger candidate.\n\nIn another primary, in New Jersey\u2019s Republican-leaning 2nd Congressional District, both Republican groups stayed out, allowing Republican Seth Grossman to defeat three other GOP contenders. Little did they know, the Democratic opposition research group American Bridge had footage from an April candidate forum where Grossman called diversity \u201ca bunch of crap and un-American.\u201d\n\nBridge quickly released the footage to the Philadelphia Inquirer. The next month, after Grossman repeatedly tried to clean up his comments \u2015 at one point, he listed off his favorite types of ethnic food \u2015 the NRCC revoked its election-night endorsement of the candidate.\n\nIn the end, Democrat Jeff Van Drew defeated Grossman by a 52 percent to 46 percent margin.\n\nAnd the DCCC believes it won on messaging. The GOP strategy of localizing races became virtually impossible with Trump, and Democrats effectively and consistently ran on health care while neutralizing the tax issue.", "The Food and Drug Administration approved a controversial new opioid formulation this month, even as critics warned that it would likely be abused.\n\nThe drug, called Dsuvia, is a synthetic opioid that\u2019s 10 times more powerful than fentanyl, the potent synthetic opioid implicated as a driving force in the 72,000 drug overdose deaths the United States logged in 2017.\n\nThe newly approved formulation of Dsuvia is a tablet version that goes under the tongue. Hospitals have administered it in IV and epidural forms for decades.\n\nFDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said in a statement that the Dsuvia tablet\u2019s \u201cunique\u201d delivery device, which is a single-dose applicator, would only be used in medical settings. He also pointed to the potential for the military to use the pain medication on the battlefield, where using an IV is impractical or impossible.\n\nHowever, the chairman of the FDA advisory committee that approved the new drug has spoken out against the decision.\n\nDr. Raeford Brown, who could not attend the advisory meeting, wrote a letter to Gottlieb and the FDA in October, urging the agency not to approve what he called the \u201cextremely divertible drug,\u201d meaning it was likely to be funneled from medical centers to the street.\n\n\u201cI predict that we will encounter diversion, abuse, and death within the early months of its availability on the market,\u201d Brown wrote.\n\nDr. Anna Lembke, chief of the Stanford University Addiction Medicine Dual Diagnosis Clinic and author of the book Drug Dealer, MD, stressed that hospitals already have plenty of ways to administer opioids and don\u2019t need another, particularly when weighed against the potential risks of the potent new formulation.\n\n\u201cThere is no need for another opioid on the market, particularly one as potentially lethal as Dsuvia,\u201d Lembke said. \u201cIn the midst of the worst opioid epidemic in U.S. history, the FDA seems to be operating in a vacuum, without regard for optics or public health.\u201d", "Tap here to turn on desktop notifications to get the news sent straight to you.", "President Donald Trump played a key role in silencing porn star Stormy Daniels and model Karen McDougal, who both claimed to have had affairs with the president.\n\nMedia executive David Pecker met with Trump multiple times to discuss using the National Enquirer tabloid to buy the silence of women he allegedly slept with, according to a new \ufeffreport from The Wall Street Journal.

He previously denied having knowledge about the payments.", "Their weekly staff meeting had become a crisis debriefing, and Axios employees were wondering where things had gone wrong. \u201cThis is small,\u201d one staffer said, according to audio obtained by HuffPost, \u201cbut I have a question along the business-editorial line.\u201d\n\nHis question was for Axios editor-in-chief Nicholas Johnston, who was meeting on Nov. 1 with a few dozen editorial staffers. The subject was a clip released by Axios two days earlier. More precisely it was the outrage over the video, from the first episode of \u201cAxios on HBO,\u201d a show that pairs two brands aimed at the tastemaking elite: One is known for high-production-value fluff and lots of gratuitous boobs. The other is HBO.\n\nIn the clip, reporter Jonathan Swan coaxes President Donald Trump toward a lunatic vow to eliminate birthright citizenship, which is guaranteed in the 14th Amendment and cannot be dumped by executive order. Swan, Axios\u2019 golden child, seems almost gleeful as the president muses about a little light ethnic cleansing by decree. Swan offers only the softest of pushbacks. (\u201cI mean, that\u2019s in dispute,\u201d he says). Linking to the story on Twitter, he said he was \u201cexcited to share\u201d the clip and accompanying story, written by him with Stef W. Kight and originally headlined \u201cExclusive: Trump to terminate birthright citizenship.\u201d The response to the video and the story was near-universal disgust.\n\nIn the staff meeting and in conversations over Slack last week, Axios employees reckoned with that disgust. The audio and the Slack screenshots were given to HuffPost by an Axios source, who requested anonymity for fear of retribution. Missteps were acknowledged in these exchanges. Some of the criticism was fair, a few employees allowed.\n\nBut by and large, staffers made clear that they put little stock in their critics. The issues were all external \u2014 the HBO show (\u201ca shitshow,\u201d as Johnston put it), jealous competitors who \u201chate us \u2019cause they ain\u2019t us,\u201d the remorseless passage of time. The problem was everything but Axios itself. No one seemed willing to acknowledge the obvious lesson: The crisis was the well-earned result of the site\u2019s own brand of journalism.\n\nIt was Swan and Kight\u2019s story that worried the employee with the editorial question at the staff meeting. For starters, there was the first paragraph, which read:\n\nPresident Trump plans to sign an executive order that would remove the right to citizenship for babies of non-citizens and unauthorized immigrants born on U.S. soil, he said yesterday in an exclusive interview for \u201cAxios on HBO,\u201d a new four-part documentary news series debuting on HBO this Sunday at 6:30 p.m. ET/PT.\n\nWasn\u2019t this too naked a publicity grab for the show? \u201cSomething about putting the airtime of the show in the lead of that story did not read right to me,\u201d the employee said. \u201cI think, \u2018It airs this Sunday is one thing.\u2019 But the \u20186:30 Eastern, 5:30,\u2019 it looked \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cA little thirsty?\u201d Johnston offered.\n\nAnother employee agreed \u201cthat it didn\u2019t look right.\u201d The staffer elaborated, \u201cHow it happened was that HBO was like, \u2018Please put this exact wording in the lede, and then let this go out before 7.\u2019\u201d\n\n(Asked whether HBO had any say over the site\u2019s news posts, Axios spokeswoman Megan Swiatkowski replied, \u201cWhat I can say, broadly speaking, is Axios alone has editorial control on all things Axios, now and forever.\u201d Her full statement is at the bottom of this post.)\n\nSome staffers evidently weren\u2019t comfortable with a news story being shaped into a promotional vehicle for a television series. This was about more than just the first paragraph. A quote in the story left unchallenged Trump\u2019s false claim that the United States is the only country to offer birthright citizenship. (A parenthetical was subsequently added.) And the original headline \u2014 later changed to \u201cExclusive: Trump targeting birthright citizenship with executive order\u201d \u2014 ascribed powers to the president that he does not possess. \u201cIn the trust ring here, I will say we have a CEO with a gift for headlines,\u201d Johnston said earlier in the meeting, referring to Jim VandeHei. \u201cAnd in the past, for some of us in editorial leadership, have had to rein them in. I was on the West Coast, and I didn\u2019t see it. Thank God it didn\u2019t say, \u2018Shock: [inaudible].\u2019\u201d\n\nSeveral things conspired to make the story seem \u201cinflammatory in service of promoting our HBO show,\u201d as one employee put it. \u201cThe combination of the headline, the very obvious and unchecked fallacy just block-quoted in the middle of the post, and the date and time of the show at the top of the post. Like, all three of those things together \u2014 four if you count the optics of, I don\u2019t know, however you want to read [inaudible] Swan in the middle of the interview \u2014 it just, it looked bad. It looked bad in a lot of different ways, and it all added up.\u201d\n\nTwitter Jonathan Swan responds to a since-deleted tweet from journalist Matthew Yglesias.\n\nThe horserace sensibility, the chumminess with power, the aggressive sell job bleeding into the journalism, the fetish for information for its own sake, denuded of context \u2014 the things alluded to by the staffer as contributing to the article\u2019s unseemliness happen to be the very things that define Axios.\n\nPolitico alums Mike Allen and Jim VandeHei founded the site in 2016 because, as its manifesto tells us, news stories are just \u201ctoo long\u201d or \u201ctoo boring.\u201d Their solution was to offer up stories consisting mainly of brief bullet-pointed items, often concluding with a \u201cBe smart\u201d \u2014 the story reduced to its most basic moral, the one line you need to do your best cable pundit impression. Axios, likewise, is journalism reduced to the transaction at its heart, untroubled by critical thought or morality. In exchange for access, the reporter effectively self-lobotomizes, suspending editorial judgment and becoming a messenger for someone else\u2019s message. Swan\u2019s exchange with Trump and the story that resulted made for a quintessential Axios moment.\n\nIn the meeting, however, the story\u2019s mistakes were attributed to haste. \u201cNobody bats a thousand,\u201d Johnston pointed out. As for the headline, \u201cwe get, like, 95 percent of them right. That one we leaned in too far. I had not thought about the 9:30 time airing. I don\u2019t hate it \u2014 I don\u2019t love it. I kind of hate it a little more now, hearing this feedback.\u201d\n\nHe said a little later, \u201cA lot of this is learning how to do this, right? This HBO show is a shitshow because we\u2019re just sort of doing it by the seat of our pants. And if our worst nightmares come true and it gets picked up and we do it again next year, I hope we\u2019ll have learned a lot of lessons on how to build structure for this and how to not be obnoxious about it. Like, remember, the interview taped \u2026 this was turned around in 12 hours. Because of all these sort of pieces coming together, it\u2019s tough to do it that quickly, and that\u2019s, I think, where some of these things slipped through.\u201d\n\nAn employee chimed in, \u201cWe thought that this was a competitive story, that was part of the rush. We were concerned about getting scooped. And so there was \u2026 so that turnaround time was bonkers.\u201d\n\nThe quick turnaround may have caused some of Axios\u2019 problems, but as Swan repeatedly noted, he had been working on the story for weeks. It\u2019s hard to imagine someone would spend that long chasing down a story without learning about the relevant details.\n\nThe day after the story went up, Swan sent an early-morning message of semi-contrition to his colleagues in Slack. (A portion of it was quoted in The New York Times.)\n\nWagons were being circled around Swan and Axios in general, both in its #kudos Slack channel and on a channel called #kudonts, usually devoted to sharing lighthearted criticism of the site. \u201cI\u2019ve long learned that it\u2019s pointless to respond to someone being snarky on the internet,\u201d one employee wrote. \u201cTheir goal isn\u2019t to be accurate \u2014 it\u2019s to make themselves look better by bullying someone else and therefore putting themselves in the Cool Kids club.\u201d Wrote another, \u201cThat a culture of tearing down journalists exists on twitter AMONG JOURNALISTS is really neat thing about the internet.\u201d\n\nIf @axios were an actual person. GO. \u2014 Sam Sanders (@samsanders) October 30, 2018\n\nEmployees wrestled with how to best handle the online criticism from media colleagues. During the meeting, one employee brought up the fact that several Axios employees had retweeted \u201csomeone who\u2019s shitting on Axios,\u201d referring to the Sam Sanders tweet above. Might such a retweet be interpreted as approval rather than condemnation? Johnston joked that perhaps staffers should just delete their accounts before offering a message that amounted to \u201cfuck the haters.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, we don\u2019t need to delete our accounts,\u201d Johnston said. \u201cWe\u2019ll keep our accounts, but I think we can be more circumspect about \u2014 and we\u2019re mostly good about this \u2014 not engaging with the trolls. ... Our profile is going to get bigger and bigger and bigger, and we\u2019re going to have more cool successes. And you know what? We\u2019re on HBO, Splinter.com, and you\u2019re not. You\u2019re fucking laid off by Gizmodo. I\u2019m sorry. So they\u2019re going to come after us on this kind of stuff.\u201d\n\nSplinter, which is owned by Gizmodo Media Group (my former employer), has been particularly critical of Axios, and it apparently struck a nerve.\n\nAt least one employee was willing to point out that perhaps not all of Axios\u2019 critics were operating out of jealousy.\n\n\u201cNick, are you worried about sort of the overall \u2026\u201d the employee said, trailing off. \u201cBecause on the one hand, something like that tweet, like, oh, they\u2019re just jealous of our success. But on the other hand, there is real criticism out there, whether or not it\u2019s valid. I mean, are you worried about the perception of us?\u201d\n\n\u201cAm I worried about the brand?\u201d Johnston said. \u201cNot really. I mean, we\u2019ve gone through [inaudible] in two years. I think everybody here works really hard. I think everybody here tries to do their best. I think we do good journalism. I think people hate us \u2019cause they ain\u2019t us, and we can always do better. So I look at all these criticisms, and I take them very personally. And I think very hard about, how am I going to hire better \u2014 better diversity and [inaudible], make Axios better in the future? Are we not writing our best headlines? Are we not being the best presence on social media? Like, I think about all these criticisms a lot. But I also realize that we\u2019re a giant target. We have a little bit of swagger, which I like. Like, we go on television. Mike and Jim are sort of preeny people. So, yeah, we\u2019re sort of proud and braggy about ourselves, and I don\u2019t feel bad about that at all.\u201d\n\nThis was a convenient recasting of the criticism directed at Axios. The problem with the site is not that it\u2019s braggy or that its social media presence is lacking in some way. The problem with Axios is that it has confused objectivity with operating from a place free of moral values, that it has become a vessel for those in power to get out whatever message is convenient at the time and that it presents these messages without giving readers any of the tools they need to understand it.\n\nOn Sunday evening, Allen sent out an internal newsletter that addressed the situation.\n\nYou have heard me say since launch that I was shocked coverage of us \u2014 and even the social media response to us \u2014 was so positive. You also heard me say it won\u2019t last forever. Why it matters: I was right. While we got an insane amount of positive or neutral coverage this past week, we also got dinged in some stories and on the satanic cesspool of media-hate also known as Twitter. Here is how we view it: Some of the criticism was valid. In our birthright citizenship piece, I should have been smarter and forced a bullet-proof headline that said, \u201cTrump to try to terminate birthright citizenship.\u201d We failed to include \u201ctry to,\u201d which left the inaccurate perception he could do this without a massive, immediate legal challenge. I also should have fact-checked Trump in initial story when he claimed America alone has this right, which is wrong. I was too focused on the scoop, so lesson learned. We did quickly add but sooner would have been better.\n\nSome of the criticism was offensive BS. The notion Trump wanted this story out was wildly wrong. In fact, it caused tremendous internal issues at the White House because people were trying to disabuse Trump of his belief that this can be done by executive fiat. Swan should have been praised for a great public service.\n\nAn NYT piece today raised questions about whether brevity sacrifices depth. I always anticipated this would be the line of attack our critics would roll out when we launched. My feelings on the topic are well-known. I will gladly stage a cage match w/ our reporters versus the NYT any day on who has more depth, experience and scoops on our shared beats. Be smart: We always need to be humble enough to take valid criticism but also self-confident enough to defend our core beliefs. You can\u2019t buy the amount of public exposure we got this past week for our journalism \u2014 and I am proud of all of you. P.S. I was especially proud of those who wrote notes to Swan when he was getting unfairly criticized. Made me smile.\n\nEveryone is basically wrong, in other words. Axios is right. And look at all this free publicity.\n\nHere\u2019s the full statement from Axios spokeswoman Megan Swiatkowski:", "President Donald Trump lashed back at an op-ed written by George Conway, husband of White House adviser Kellyanne Conway, that criticized Trump\u2019s appointment of Matthew Whitaker as acting attorney general.\n\n\u201cYou mean Mr. Kellyanne Conway? He\u2019s just trying to get publicity for himself,\u201d Trump told reporters on Friday morning.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask Kellyanne that question, all right?\u201d he added. \u201cShe might know him better than me. I really don\u2019t know the guy.\u201d", "The ladies of Twitter never fail to brighten our days with their brilliant \u2015 but succinct \u2015 wisdom.

Mark Sanford (R), who opposed offshore exploration, in a June Republican primary. Arrington argued that Sanford, a staunch fiscal conservative who publicly criticized Trump, was insufficiently supportive of the president.\n\nIn the end, however, Trump\u2019s policies and Arrington\u2019s initial support for them cost Republicans a once-safe district that includes Charleston, Beaufort and other coastal communities.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t go to D.C. and represent these communities fairly if you support offshore drilling,\u201d said Nancy Mace, a Charleston-area Republican state representative and offshore drilling opponent who won re-election handily on Tuesday and did not endorse in South Carolina\u2019s 1st. \u201cThat was certainly an issue that crept up, and I think was above-the-fold No. 1 of any other issue in that particular race.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was the issue. It was the focal point of the whole campaign,\u201d said Ben Mack, the head of the Sierra Club\u2019s South Carolina chapter.\n\nTrav Robertson, chairman of the South Carolina Democratic Party, called opposition to offshore drilling \u201ccentral\u201d to his party\u2019s good fortune in the district.\n\n\u201cIt was an issue that transcended political party, demographic, age,\u201d he said.\n\nIt may continue to do so. The fossil fuel industry spent more than $100 million this election to defeat key ballot measures in Arizona, Colorado and Washington. Yet oil and gas companies failed to make the same inroads on the East Coast, where Florida voters overwhelmingly approved a ban on drilling in state waters on Tuesday. The White House is planning a major pipeline push in the next year, teeing up a new wave of fights over polluting infrastructure.\n\nThe Trump administration announced plans in January to expand offshore oil and gas exploration rights in the Atlantic, Pacific and Arctic oceans, overturning restrictions on the practice put in place by the Obama administration.\n\nThen, in a May debate with Sanford, Arrington said she supported Trump\u2019s actions.\n\n\u201cWhen we talk about offshore drilling \u2015 nothing\u2019s happening,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s President Trump \u2015 and I support what he did \u2015 he lifted the ban on offshore drilling.\u201d\n\nCharleston\u2019s this beautiful historic city. We don\u2019t need that kind of debris lying about. Jimmy Carroll, mayor of Isle of Palms\n\nTyler Jones, a spokesman for Cunningham\u2019s campaign, told HuffPost that finding those comments, which were not widely publicized when she said them, was \u201cthe most pivotal moment in the campaign.\u201d\n\nArrington struggled to backtrack on the remark, voicing opposition to offshore development on her website, in TV ads, in direct mail and on social media, according to Andrew Boucher, a spokesman for her campaign.\n\n\u201cShe came out against offshore drilling in South Carolina about 47,000 times,\u201d Boucher said in an email. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what more she could have done to make it clear.\u201d\n\nSouth Carolina\u2019s 1st is a highly educated, affluent district in the Low Country region that is heavily dependent on coastal tourism. The country club-style Republicanism of the district was already somewhat at odds with Trump\u2019s coarse style and penchant for immigrant bashing. And an influx of professionals from more liberal parts of the country had also been diluting the district\u2019s reddish hue.\n\nAs a result, Trump won in the 1st there by just 13 percentage points in 2016, significantly underperforming Sanford\u2019s 22-point re-election margin.\n\nArrington\u2019s support for opening the coast to offshore drilling was an additional blow for some onetime GOP partisans. Days after her primary win, the mayors of the coastal towns of Folly Beach and Isle of Palms, both of whom are Republicans, cited the specter of offshore drilling in their endorsement of Cunningham.\n\nOffshore drilling \u201cwas everything,\u201d said Isle of Palms Mayor Jimmy Carroll, whose only non-Republican vote in 2016 was for Libertarian presidential contender Gary Johnson.\n\nCarroll cited both the environmental and economic impact of a potential oil spill in the tourism-heavy region, as well as the more immediate aesthetic damage of the onshore equipment needed to conduct the exploration and drilling.\n\n\u201cCharleston\u2019s this beautiful historic city. We don\u2019t need that kind of debris lying about,\u201d Carroll said.\n\nFolly Beach Mayor Tim Goodwin, who voted for Trump and Sanford in 2016, had a similar assessment. He was particularly peeved that Trump had exempted Florida, where the president owns resorts.\n\nThe proponents of offshore oil and gas exploration often tried to assure Goodwin that because there was no oil and gas to be found off of South Carolina\u2019s coast, he had nothing to worry about.\n\nThat did not persuade Goodwin, the mayor told HuffPost. \u201cIf we can all agree there\u2019s no oil out there, why do we wanna mess up the environment?\u201d\n\nBoth Carroll and Goodwin said that they would have enthusiastically backed Sanford if he had remained the Republican nominee.\n\nAssociated Press Republican Katie Arrington defeated Rep. Mark Sanford (R-S.C.) in a June primary only to lose to Cunningham in the general election.\n\nThe high-profile Republican support Cunningham received for his stance allowed him to cast himself as a moderate, independent-leaning Democrat with crossover appeal.\n\nHe hammered Arrington for her May remarks in his advertisements, including a 30-second October spot featuring a wetsuit-clad Cunningham treading water in the ocean with his face to the camera.\n\n\u201cI have always opposed offshore drilling. My opponent \u2015 not so much,\u201d Cunningham says in the ad. The camera then cuts to the clip of Arrington.\n\nCarroll, Goodwin and other Republican elected officials from coastal towns touted their support for Cunningham in the candidate\u2019s final advertisement.\n\nMeanwhile, Arrington began denying that she supported offshore drilling and argued that she would be in a better position to lobby the Trump administration to protect South Carolina.\n\nIn late September, Arrington posted a photo of herself talking to Vice President Mike Pence on Facebook.\n\n\u201cThankful to have a few minutes this morning with Vice President Mike Pence discussing our #SC1 Lowcountry and sharing my strong opposition of drilling for oil off of South Carolina\u2019s coast,\u201d Arrington wrote alongside the photo.\n\nArrington financed an ad in early October exclusively devoted to claiming that she was the more effective opponent of offshore drilling. It was a theme she would return to in her final ad, in which she repeated her opposition to offshore drilling, yet also lamented that it was \u201call [Cunningham] talks about,\u201d when there were many important issues facing the district.\n\nBut it was only one of many messages Arrington tried against Cunningham. She also blanketed the airwaves with more cookie-cutter national themes, painting Cunningham as a \u201cNancy Pelosi liberal\u201d who would be soft on immigration enforcement.\n\nBut some of Arrington\u2019s skeptics didn\u2019t buy her about-face.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re gonna come out in the middle of the campaign and switch sides \u2015 that doesn\u2019t do a whole lot for me,\u201d Goodwin said.\n\nAt the same time, Cunningham got a boost from 314 Action, a PAC that supports scientist candidates. 314 Action spent over $520,000 on ads touting Cunningham\u2019s environmental record and slamming Arrington for her May comments. One spot even noted that Arrington\u2019s campaign had received contributions from the oil and gas industry after backing Trump\u2019s decision to lift the ban on drilling.\n\nJamie Henn, a co-founder of the grassroots environmental nonprofit 350.org, said Cunningham\u2019s win could be a model for other Democrats.", "Fede Alvarez is in the business of toppling expectations.

It\u2019s a soft reboot of sorts, jettisoning the courtroom drama of the latter half of Larsson\u2019s series to reunite the still dragon-inked Lisbeth Salander with her foil and sometime love interest Mikael Blomkvist.\n\nThe man who has built his career on gorefests and tension-stuffed chamber pieces seems, at first, like a surprising fit for another meditative exploration of misogyny and violence against women. But this follow-up is more superhero flick than subtle rumination. It\u2019s the kind of pulpy action movie that contrasts Salander\u2019s esoteric dives into the matrix with scenes like the one that involves her crushing and snorting amphetamines on the floor of a bloody bathroom. Here, Salander is more edgy Avenger than a labyrinth of contradictions.\n\nTo say liberties were taken would be fair; it\u2019s something Alvarez admits in the first minutes of an interview.\n\nSony Pictures \u201cThe Girl In The Spider\u2019s Web\u201d is an adaptation of the fourth book in the Millennium series, published after original author Stieg Larsson\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cI think the big lesson I learned making [\u2018Evil Dead\u2019] was that if you\u2019re faithful to the spirit of the original creation, you\u2019ll be fine,\u201d he said over the phone. \u201cA lot of the times you get caught up on trying to reproduce things, trying to do the same thing again just to try and have the success of the other movies or something. \u2026 [You] really just have to be faithful to the spirit of the original material.\u201d\n\n\u201cSpider\u2019s Web\u201d is Alvarez\u2019s first proper studio work, and in his hands, Lisbeth is transformed into a club kid Batman. In the one of the film\u2019s first shots of the hacker, she\u2019s set in relief against black gothic wings, casting her as a stylish angel of death, complete with getaway cars and impenetrable stares \u2014 a choice that lobs a character that was once the object of writer and audience surrogate Mikael\u2019s obsession into the center of the action.\n\n\u201cWe really reframed it,\u201d Alvarez said. \u201c[The books] always focused on the Mikael Blomkvist story. It begins with him and ends with him. She\u2019s either the sidekick like she is in the first story, where she has her own chapter, the rape and revenge story, or she becomes the Watson to his Holmes in a way. And then in the second and this one, it\u2019s almost like [she\u2019s] a unicorn. He\u2019s chasing his muse, this object of his fascination.\u201d\n\n\u201cSpider\u2019s Web\u201d takes pains to cast this new Lisbeth as the master of her own story \u2015 or at least, not the victim in anyone else\u2019s. More than once, we see her choose dives from death-defying heights over surrender.\n\n\u201cWe [don\u2019t] have any powerful men in the movie,\u201d gushed Alvarez. \u201cThe guys are just trying to do whatever they can to have a part of the story. But it\u2019s really \u2015 the women are not talking about another dude. They\u2019re not servicing another man\u2019s story. It\u2019s really a clear exercise that we did when working on the script, where we thought, \u2018How can we honor the spirit of Lisbeth Salander?\u2019 And it\u2019s not Lisbeth Salander the assistant or Lisbeth Salander the muse. This time it\u2019s Lisbeth Salander the main character that really drives the story.\u201d\n\nSony Pictures Alvarez hailed Foy as \u201cone of the greatest actors working today.\u201d\n\nClaire Foy picks up the Salander mantle from prior incarnations by Rooney Mara and Noomi Rapace. According to Alvarez, the \u201cThe Crown\u201d and \u201cFirst Man\u201d actress was crucial in shaping a new version of the established antihero.\n\n\u201cI was really making an effort of making sure I wasn\u2019t bringing to the screen such a female icon and making it from a 100 percent male perspective, which is the history of Hollywood, unfortunately,\u201d Alvarez said. \u201cI was really trying hard to \u2015 even harder than in the past \u2015 to really listen to the actor, not just when it comes to what she\u2019s going to wear and how much makeup she\u2019s going to have \u2026 but really about how to shoot her, how to portray her. What are the things I\u2019m going to show her doing, what are the things I shouldn\u2019t? I was really paying attention to her. And she had really strong opinions on that as well, which for me was very interesting.\u201d\n\nAlvarez, whose previous two films were anchored by all-in performances from the underrated Jane Levy, hailed Foy as \u201cone of the greatest actors working today\u201d and said his decision to cast her boiled down simply to her immense ability to convey depths of emotion on screen.\n\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t have a lot of lines,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s constantly trying to hide her emotions from you. A great actor can be hiding emotions actively all the time, but you as an audience will know exactly how she feels. \u2026 And I think Claire does exactly that, really, with very little.\u201d\n\nEver candid, Alvarez didn\u2019t hesitate to draw attention to the gender dynamics of the 2011 adaptation by the famously exacting David Fincher. \u201cI think [\u2018Spider\u2019s Web\u2019] is the first time [Lisbeth] hasn\u2019t been portrayed by a director that is forcing his will on someone and saying, \u2018This is the way it is,\u2019 but letting the actor make a lot of those decisions. And I\u2019m really proud of that. It turns out you really just have to let go about a lot of your personal vision. I had to learn to make that sacrifice in order to let that actor be free and really portray the character in the way they believe is the right way. That was a big part of making this movie, was to really listen to what she had to say.\u201d\n\nSony Pictures In \"The Girl In The Spider's Web,\" Lisbeth is a club kid Batman, a stylish angel of death, complete with getaway cars and impenetrable stares.\n\nAlvarez made clear that this process \u2015 particularly in the era of the Me Too movement, which he said \u201cexploded\u201d while the film was in preproduction \u2015 was a different one for him, an exercise in listening and relinquishing for the sake of the film\u2019s ultimate effect. Still, he doesn\u2019t want to wish away all the credit. His voice crackles a bit as he excitedly announces a minor \u201cspoiler alert\u201d about a detail from the film\u2019s third act, a role reversal that\u2019s exactly his kind of catnip.\n\n\u201cWhen [Lisbeth] leaves Blomkvist in the house stuck with the kid, it\u2019s my favorite moment,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause that always happens in other films, where [female characters are] left in the house with the kid, but she leaves them to go save the world.\u201d\n\nPerhaps Alvarez hasn\u2019t quite yet earned the title of Hollywood provocateur, but with \u201cSpider\u2019s Web,\u201d he continues to delight in defying preconceptions. His cinematic choices remain as divisive as they are delicious \u2015 a tongue lasciviously pressed against the blade of a knife so hard that it splits in two in \u201cEvil Dead,\u201d a jittery chase scene shot in utter darkness in \u201cDon\u2019t Breathe,\u201d an unrelenting tase to the nether regions in \u201cSpider\u2019s Web.\u201d While the edges of his latest film might feel ever so slightly sanded down to blockbuster-friendly outlines, there\u2019s still a glimpse of Alvarez\u2019s trademark rebellion.", "Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) may or may not be preparing for a presidential run in 2020.\n\nGillibrand stopped by \u201cThe Late Show with Stephen Colbert\u201d on Thursday night to discuss her new children\u2019s book Bold and Brave, the midterm elections and the resignation of Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Toward the end of the conversation, Colbert asked the question on everyone\u2019s mind.\n\n\u201cI know you\u2019ve been saying for a long time now that you don\u2019t want to talk about 2020 because you\u2019re concentrated on 2018,\u201d Colbert said, while jokingly tapping his fingers on his desk. \u201cMidterms are over \u2014 what are you concentrating on now? Is there another election that you might be concentrating on?\u201d\n\nThe senator took her time responding to the question, giving a rather roundabout answer.\n\n\u201cI do think it\u2019s an important question,\u201d Gillibrand began, before Colbert cut her off. \u201cIt is an important question,\u201d he responded, \u201cThat\u2019s why I asked it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe it is a moral question for me. I believe in right vs. wrong, and until this election I actually thought that wrong was winning,\u201d she continued. \u201cAs I\u2019ve traveled across my state, across the country for all these candidates, I\u2019ve seen the hatred and the division that President Trump has put out into our country and it has called me to fight as hard as I possibly can to restore the moral compass of this country.\u201d", "Kate Middleton can teach all the royals a thing or two about recycling clothing.\n\nThe Duchess of Cambridge donned a gorgeous teal Jenny Packham dress (last seen around six years ago!) at the 2018 Tusk Conservation Awards on Thursday night.

Whitaker also later served as the chairman of a Clovis campaign for state treasurer.\n\nIn an interview with Reuters, Clovis said Whitaker is \u201ca wonderful man\u201d and \u201ca dear friend.\u201d He added that Whitaker was a \u201csounding board\u201d for him when Clovis worked for Trump\u2019s campaign.\n\nWalter Shaub, who was director of the U.S. Office of Government Ethics for four years before resigning in July 2017, said the friendship between Whitaker and Clovis should disqualify Whitaker from supervising the Mueller investigation.\n\n\u201cWhitaker has to recuse himself under DOJ\u2019s regulation requiring recusal if you have a personal or political relationship with someone substantially involved in conduct that is the subject of the investigation or prosecution,\u201d Shaub told Reuters.\n\nDepartment of Justice spokesperson Sarah Isgur Flores declined to comment.\n\n\n\nA DOJ regulation cited by Shaub states that employees \u201cmay not supervise prosecutions or investigations that involve someone with a personal or political relationship.\u201d\n\nIt says the possible conflict can be set aside if the employee\u2019s supervisor judges that the relationship does not affect the official\u2019s impartiality or create the public perception of a conflict.\n\nTrevor Potter, a former Republican commissioner on the Federal Election Commission who now leads the Campaign Legal Center, which advocates for more transparency in elections, said the question of whether Whitaker should recuse himself depends on Clovis\u2019 status in the Mueller investigation.\n\n\u201cIf he has a close personal friendship with someone who is involved in the investigation because of his role in the Trump campaign, then that would present a recusal issue,\u201d Potter said.\n\nMueller has not publicly identified any of the targets of his investigation.\n\nPaul Rosenzweig, a fellow at the non-partisan R Street Institute which specializes in public policy, said he believed Whitaker\u2019s friendship with Clovis is \u201cprobably not a problem\u201d but that Whitaker should ask the DOJ\u2019s Professional Responsibility and Accountability Office whether he has a conflict.\n\nWhile he still led the government ethics office, Shaub last year advised the Justice Department to require Sessions\u2019 recusal from the Mueller probe because Sessions had been a senior adviser to Trump during the election campaign.\n\nSessions\u2019 decision to recuse himself infuriated Trump.

According to my family, I had enough hearing to adapt to the hearing world and attend mainstream school. I struggled through school, not only to hear my teachers \u2015 some of whom begged for my parents to get me hearing aids \u2015 but also to hear my classmates. I felt isolated and disconnected from people most of the time, even though my mother is deaf and the Deaf world was part of my life. I experienced the jokes, bullying and rejections of growing up hard of hearing in a world where everyone can hear.\n\nYet I did learn how to adapt to the hearing world. I learned to read lips, decipher body language, and find patterns in daily activities to predict conversations. (People are predictable.) I even use reading to learn new words so it will be easier for me to grasp words within conversations. I\u2019m grateful that I understand at least 85 percent of most conversations around me. I can glide around mainstream culture and act as if I have normal hearing even if I\u2019m not wearing my hearing aids.\n\nIf I\u2019m not wearing my hearing aids, I pretend I can hear everything when I really don\u2019t, just to be part of the hearing world. The truth is I miss words and nod to inaudible conversations while smiling. Sometimes, I depend on other people to tell me what\u2019s going on. On most days, that works.\n\nI use my phone flash for notifications and captions to watch TV. I ask people to repeat themselves, and I can\u2019t follow a group conversation in a noisy restaurant. I can\u2019t walk and listen at the same time. I need to see a person\u2019s face to get the full conversation. I have to strain to hear certain voices \u2015 like children\u2019s \u2015 even if I have hearing aids. The aftermath is that I get exhausted more easily. Then I avoid these necessary social interactions, even if I want to be a part of them. These challenges leave me feeling isolated, lonely and fatigued.\n\nThe truth is I miss words and nod to inaudible conversations while smiling. Sometimes, I depend on other people to tell me what\u2019s going on.\n\nI don\u2019t feel like I fit into the hearing world. But I don\u2019t fit into the Deaf world either.\n\nMy mom gave me an inherited connection to the Deaf world. She is immersed in the Deaf culture \u2015 a vibrant, talented beautiful community. Profoundly deaf in one ear since birth, my mother attended schools for Deaf children and uses interpreters to communicate with the hearing world. Her experiences provide her with a sense of belonging to the Deaf world, but they also come with constant discrimination from the hearing world.\n\nThere are some differences that create a disconnection between me and the Deaf world. As a CODA \u2015 child of a deaf adult \u2015 when I\u2019m with Deaf friends, my default role becomes that of an unofficial interpreter. I become the assigned interpreter of the group because I have enough hearing to carry a conversation with a hearing person. I remember having to interpret for my mother as a child. I was forced to interpret for her at doctor\u2019s appointments, government offices and everywhere else. Most times, I\u2019d have to miss school to attend these appointments with her.\n\nWhile the ADA law states that an interpreter must be provided to a Deaf person, the reality is that more often than not, an interpreter is not offered. So I interpret for her, but having moderate hearing loss affects my ability to interpret. I always feel anxious; I have to listen to all the verbal and non-verbal cues of the speaker, process the message, and translate to American Sign Language (ASL) \u2015 all while delivering the message simultaneously to the Deaf person. This is a much more involved and complicated process that I have not fully mastered even after years of practice.\n\nMy hearing usually leaves me uncertain of the message and stressed about the implication of delivering it incorrectly. Basically, I am terrified of getting it wrong. If I\u2019m interpreting for a friend at a doctor\u2019s office, misunderstanding how many pills she has to take can result in an overdose. Many times, a person can fully hear the message someone else is trying to communicate but doesn\u2019t understand it. This added stress makes me shy away from Deaf friends. I feel guilty because I want to relax with friends without the pressure of interpreting.\n\nWhen I\u2019ve tried to immerse myself in the Deaf world, I have felt that my hearing loss is not profound enough to fully embrace the Deaf culture.\n\nAnother reason I don\u2019t fit entirely into the Deaf world is that I don\u2019t need to use some of the resources available to that community. I don\u2019t personally use an interpreter to communicate. I don\u2019t need a flashing doorbell or flashing smoke alarms. I don\u2019t need video phones. I learned ASL as a child but I mainly communicate with my voice, speaking English or Spanish to friends and family.\n\nWhen I\u2019ve tried to immerse myself in the Deaf world, I have felt that my hearing loss is not profound enough to fully embrace the Deaf culture. In the past, I\u2019ve been discouraged from using my voice and pushed to only communicate in ASL. But using my voice is part of who I am, not a denial of the Deaf culture.\n\nI have a hearing husband and two sons, one whom is hard of hearing. None of them have fully mastered ASL. Learning a language is difficult and requires years of practice. Even if my husband and sons take the time to learn the language, they may never be completely fluent. Thus, we still use our voices at home when we communicate.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, the Deaf community has been welcoming to me. I\u2019ve always wanted to feel like I belonged in both the Deaf and hearing worlds, but I don\u2019t fully feel a part of either.\n\nAs I continue my journey, I realize how badly I need more accessibility, compassion and acceptance from the hearing world. I don\u2019t use the same resources other people with hearing loss may request, but I still need certain accommodations. I rely on subtitles, and as a consumer of all media platforms, I still find gaps when I access videos. Video feeds have expanded; the option to caption videos in all platforms should expand as well. This is especially true for live video streams such as Instagram Live. As a creator of Facebook and Instagram videos, I find myself with limited captioning options, so I understand the limitations. Yet it is a necessary feature.\n\nAs noisy as the world is, I\u2019m amazed at how we take for granted that someone \u2015 with or without a hearing loss \u2015 can hear or understand us.\n\nFace-to-face conversations are perfect opportunities to show compassion. It\u2019s helpful when people look at me while they speak and don\u2019t get frustrated if I ask them to repeat themselves. It\u2019s hard for me to hear people when they cover their mouths, turn away from me or talk to me from another room. Some people get frustrated when I ask them to repeat themselves, and their first response is to say, \u201cnevermind.\u201d Nevermind sounds to me like \u201cYou are not worth my time.\u201d As noisy as the world is, I\u2019m amazed at how we take for granted that someone \u2015 with or without a hearing loss \u2015 can hear or understand us.\n\nAbove all, I would like for people to accept that despite my hearing loss, I can accomplish anything I want. I\u2019m neither lucky nor unlucky. I\u2019m a professional writer, a data analyst, and I\u2019m successful in my life. My hearing loss is not a hindrance. My hearing loss does not determine my intelligence, skills, talent, focus or the lack thereof. I am hard of hearing and I work hard to succeed. I use all the resources I need to make my life work for me. Any hinderance I face comes from the unacceptability of my uniqueness.\n\nI invite the hearing world to embrace our differences so we can learn from each other and create a new world full of opportunities and adventures for everyone.", "\u201cThe Daily Show\u201d host Trevor Noah loves a good romance \u2015 especially the professional one between President Donald Trump and the man Trump appointed acting attorney general, Matthew Whitaker.\n\nWhitaker, who replaced his boss, Jeff Sessions, after Trump booted him the day after this week\u2019s midterm elections, has been wooing the president for a while, it seems.

Nationwide, at least 30 state and local initiatives proposed legal changes that would fund affordable housing, provide homeless services or expand tenant protections, according to the National Low-Income Housing Coalition. Twenty-three of those measures passed.\n\nThe United States needs more than 7 million units of affordable housing to meet its current needs, according to the NLIHC. In 2016, nearly half of the nation\u2019s renters were considered cost-burdened, spending more than 30 percent of their income on rent. Until this year, though, political efforts to address the crisis have trailed far behind its expanding scope.\n\n\u201cThe need for more housing and its effects on residents and businesses has finally reached a tipping point,\u201d said Priya Jayachandran, the president of the National Housing Trust. \u201cAfter being barely mentioned in the 2016 election, the need for more affordable housing was touted by many House and gubernatorial candidates and local and statewide affordable housing measures appeared on ballots across the country.\u201d\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey was a high-profile opponent of San Francisco's Proposition C, which will tax large corporations to provide homeless services.\n\nThe most ambitious of these efforts could provide models for regulation in other cities. San Francisco\u2019s Proposition C, for example, will impose a tax on large corporations to fund homeless services. While the measure was controversial locally \u2014 Twitter\u2019s Jack Dorsey led the opposition and Salesforce\u2019s Marc Benioff gathered support \u2014 it passed easily, with 60 percent of the vote. If the measure survives a likely legal challenge, it will raise an estimated $300 million, provide 5,000 affordable housing units and add 1,000 beds to San Francisco shelters.\n\nOther cities also explored new housing-related revenue streams. Berkeley and Oakland passed real estate transfer taxes, an extra fee added to the purchase price of homes. Voters in Telluride, Colorado, authorized the city to take on debt to construct more low-income units. Richmond, California, and Oakland proposed taxing vacant properties. Napa County and West Marin, also in California, will increase their hotel taxes.\n\nThese measures, Jayachandran said, \u201crepresent local government and local citizens making funding for affordable housing a priority even when their state may not.\u201d In Austin, Texas, residents defeated a proposition that would have required voter approval for any significant changes to the city\u2019s zoning code. If it had passed, the measure would have delayed the process of adding density as the city continues to grow.\n\nCities also approved housing bonds by wide margins. A Portland proposal to spend $652.8 million constructing up to 12,000 units of affordable housing passed with 59 percent of the vote. Nearly three-quarters of voters in Austin also approved a $250 million housing bond. Sixty-eight percent of Charlotte, North Carolina, voters approved a measure tripling the size of the city\u2019s housing trust fund.\n\nWhile the housing initiatives were largely focused on cities, there was action at the state level too. California voters passed $6 billion in bonds for housing and homeless services and rejected an effort to cut property taxes for older homeowners that would cost the state billions in lost revenue. In Oregon, voters approved Measure 102, which will allow public funds to support affordable housing. Previously, government entities were barred from giving funding to any private entity, including nonprofit property developers.\n\nBloomberg via Getty Images Voters in Austin, Texas, approved a $250 million bond to address the city's affordable housing crisis.\n\nBut Tuesday\u2019s results weren\u2019t uniformly positive for advocates of urgently addressing the housing crisis. In California, a number of housing bonds received a majority of the vote, but were rejected because the state requires a 66 percent approval for any tax increase.\n\nAnother mixed result was California\u2019s Proposition 10, which would have allowed cities to impose and expand rent control legislation. Supporters, including tenants\u2019 rights groups and the mayors of San Francisco and Los Angeles, argued that the measure would protect low-income renters from evictions. Opponents, including the business community and Republican and Democratic gubernatorial candidates, said it would discourage the construction of new apartments. The merits of both arguments will remain unexplored: The measure lost decisively, 38 percent to 62 percent.\n\nBut the biggest controversy concerning the wave of new housing policies was their relative modesty. Even supporters of this year\u2019s ballot measures noted that, while extra units of housing and additional funding are welcome, they are tiny compared to the scale of the problem. As HuffPost has chronicled in its ongoing Betting the House project, rising rents and soaring living costs affect a large and growing percentage of Americans, and nearly every political measure to address it has so far fallen short.\n\n\u201c$6 billion is not enough,\u201d Leslye Corsiglia, the executive director of housing advocacy organization SV@Home, told CityLab during the campaign, \u201cbut it is more than we\u2019ve ever had.\u201d", "Miami Herald via Getty Images Christopher Schaefer, 4, walks through the tent he and his family began living in after Hurricane Michael devastated the Florida Panhandle in mid-October.\n\nAfter Hurricane Harvey barreled through Kenneth Williamson\u2019s three-bedroom home last year in the Fontaine Place neighborhood of Houston, the retired day laborer was devastated. At their height, floodwaters grazed Williamson\u2019s knees and mold quickly developed throughout the house. His roof and floors were damaged and most of his furniture was destroyed \u2015and those were just some of the issues.\n\nBut Williamson, 62, was also somewhat hopeful. He figured he\u2019d at least receive some funding from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to help rebuild the house that had belonged to his late mother.\n\nWilliamson applied for FEMA funds and underwent an inspection. Soon after, he received a letter informing him that his request for aid had been denied. The agency claimed his home was in habitable condition, Williamson told HuffPost.\n\n\u201cThey told me to live in it,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cThey said it was livable.\u201d\n\nWilliamson then turned to BakerRipley, a nonprofit that supports low-income Houston residents. The group worked on Williamson\u2019s home from May through September and spent over $35,000 on repairs, said Rene Solis, senior vice president of public sector solutions at BakerRipley. But even with the job completed, the home won\u2019t be 100 percent restored to its original condition, Solis said.\n\nWilliamson\u2019s story is a common one in the wake of natural disasters: It\u2019s often the poorest people who struggle the most to access federal dollars after a storm hits. Housing repairs typically are the most pressing need \u2015 and also what they have the most trouble getting. That problem is cropping up again as people affected by Hurricane Michael begin to try to put their shattered lives back together.\n\nScott Olson via Getty Images In Panama City alone, where one in five people were already living in poverty, somewhere between 10,000 and 20,000 people have become homeless since Hurricane Michael.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s never a time when people need the federal government more than when their community has been wrecked by Mother Nature,\u201d said Marion McFadden, senior vice president of public policy and adviser on resilience at Enterprise Community Partners, a nonprofit that creates affordable housing opportunities. \u201cWhat we see is, the people who had the lowest income, and the greatest need for support before a disaster, are the ones who are slowest to recover.\u201d\n\nFEMA\u2019s responsible for coordinating government-wide relief efforts after disasters hit, which starts with offering basic necessities in the immediate aftermath and then extends to addressing survivors\u2019 more long-term needs, including housing issues. FEMA funds help impacted residents find temporary housing and restore damaged homes, but the agency isn\u2019t responsible for addressing every repair issue. The organization just works to make residences habitable.\n\nA major issue adversely affecting low-income residents is that FEMA focuses on supporting homeowners, not renters. Worsening the plight of low-income tenants is that they are often hit with rent hikes and mass evictions after a disaster.\n\nAlso, people who live in flood-prone areas but don\u2019t have flood insurance are often denied help. And the bureaucratic process of applying \u2015 and appealing \u2015 is complicated.\n\nEven when FEMA funds are awarded, it may just be a paltry amount. The agency has a cap on the amount of funds it can dole out, which varies from disaster to disaster, depending on how much damage occurred. After Hurricane Maria slammed Puerto Rico last year and caused especially widespread damage, FEMA contributed more than $3 billion to the recovery effort.\n\nFEMA collaborates with a number of organizations, including the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which, in addition to working to repair damaged homes, trains workers who can help in the recovery phase. But there\u2019s a \u201chuge\u201d gap in the amount of time it takes to receive HUD dollars, McFaddon said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a long process,\u201d said Solis, who added that it\u2019s discouraging to him and his staff when they learn that a resident is denied government funding after a storm. \u201cIt frustrates us just as much as it frustrates the homeowner,\u201d he said.\n\nJoe Raedle via Getty Images Residents hang a sign out that reads, 'FEMA Please Help Make Mexico Beach Great Again' outside their home that was damaged by Hurricane Michael. The town of Mexico Beach was particularly hard hit.\n\nA month after Hurricane Michael slammed into the Florida Panhandle, residents affected it are now ensnared in a housing crisis that\u2019s reminiscent of the one caused by Hurricane Harvey and so many other storms before it. In Panama City alone, where one in five people were already living in poverty, somewhere between 10,000 and 20,000 people have become homeless since the storm. In Bay County, where Panama City is located, 48,665 households have applied for FEMA aid.\n\nMembers of Florida\u2019s congressional delegation requested that FEMA administrator Brock Long act \u201cquickly\u201d to approve direct housing assistance for areas affected by Hurricane Michael and to deploy resources \u201cimmediately.\u201d\n\nFEMA told HuffPost in an email that part of its 2018-2022 strategic plan includes streamlining its assistance efforts. The agency said it wants to better educate survivors about the application process to help them avoid delays and also to \u201cmanage expectations\u201d so that recipients are aware what forms of assistance FEMA and its federal partners can actually provide.\n\nThe flood insurance problem remains a major sticking point.\n\nOf about 5 million properties in flood hazard areas, fewer than a third are insured by the National Flood Insurance Program. On average, American homeowners pay about $700 a year for flood insurance premiums. The cost of flood insurance continues to increase, however, without taking household income into account.\n\nWithout flood insurance, residents are typically out of luck when it comes to accessing federal funds.\n\nAfter Hurricane Harvey, numerous residents in Kashmere Gardens, a low-income Houston neighborhood hit hard by the hurricane, were denied FEMA benefits because they didn\u2019t have flood insurance.\n\n\u201cA lot of residents are still struggling over a year after the storm. A lot of people are falling through the cracks in the community,\u201d Keith Downey, president of the Kashmere Gardens Super Neighborhood Council, told HuffPost. \u201cThese communities were already making hard choices between food and medicine, long before this happened.\u201d\n\nLoren Elliott via Getty Images Dorothy Rainey is pictured in her home, which was badly damaged by Hurricane Harvey, in Houston's the Kashmere Gardens neighborhood.\n\nIn April, FEMA released a report that analyzed the cost burden of flood insurance and the populations most affected by it, and provided suggestions to help close the insurance gap.\n\nWhile experts agree the report was valuable, they stress that follow-up action is needed.\n\n\u201cCongress gave FEMA the ability to study (the issue), but not the ability to do anything about it,\u201d McFadden said.\n\nMcFadden, who has more than 15 years of experience in disaster recovery efforts, said the key to improving outcomes is addressing issues before a storm hits \u2015 ensuring structures are built to withstand storms and creating tools to prepare tenants to deal with flooding and mold, for example.\n\nShe expressed optimism about some pieces of recent legislation. Congress this year awarded $16 billion to HUD solely for \u201cmitigation\u201d activities. That covers efforts that protect communities from damage that can be anticipated. Signed this month, the Disaster Reform and Recovery Act provides a steady stream of funding for officials to invest in better protecting their communities, instead of just relying on grants from year to year.\n\nBut changes like this are incremental, and much more needs to be done to better protect vulnerable communities, McFadden added.\n\n\u201cDisaster recovery is never going to be fast. That\u2019s the very nature of the challenge,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to do a better of job of making sure that the safety net reaches everybody that\u2019s been impacted. Every community you go to that\u2019s been through it, there\u2019s just such tremendous frustration.\u201d", "Every year the numbers get worse: soaring rents, booming home prices and dwindling social spending. Since its beginnings as a background issue in coastal enclaves, the housing crisis has gone mainstream, hitting smaller cities and out-of-the-way towns across the country.\n\nThis year, HuffPost has chronicled multiple angles of the housing crisis, from its effect on millennials to its impact on inequality to its arrival in unexpected places. Last month, we traveled to six U.S. cities and held a town hall dedicated to housing affordability in Boulder, Colorado, where we asked you to share your housing stories. We also launched Betting The House, a project to hear our readers\u2019 experiences with buying and renting a home in America.\n\nWe received more than 400 responses, covering nearly every state and demographic: old and young, urban and rural, renters and owners. They told us how housing affected them and surprised us with the corners of their lives the crisis was creeping into. They broke our hearts and gave us hope. Here\u2019s what they told us.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS\n\n\u2018I\u2019ll Have To Choose Between Tuition And Rent\u2019\n\nAn overwhelming theme we saw in the responses was that readers are making serious compromises to pay their housing costs. One reader lived with her parents 90 minutes from work and couldn\u2019t afford to move out. Another had delayed marriage for years. A third cooked at home, got rid of her phone, hasn\u2019t had a vacation in five years and sometimes washed her clothes in the sink to avoid laundromat fees.\n\nOverall, 23 percent of our respondents said they spent more than half of their income on housing. More than a third fit the definition of \u201ccost-burdened,\u201d meaning their accommodations took up more than 30 percent of their income. \u201cHousing costs absorb more and more of my take home pay,\u201d wrote one respondent, \u201cso therefore I survive on less. I eat once a day, I do not purchase new clothing or shoes unless absolutely required. My automobile is in need of significant repairs that I cannot afford. And I cannot provide as much support to my children as I would like or that they require.\u201d\n\nAge played a huge role in the responses. Students told us they would never be able to make their housing situation work without their parents. Young workers dreamed of getting out of the paycheck-to-paycheck cycle. One said that if his parents decide to move or kick him out before he graduates, \u201cI\u2019ll have to choose between tuition and rent.\u201d\n\nAt the older end of the scale, readers described the difficult transition from working to not working. One reader said that a small pension was never enough to cover Virginia\u2019s housing costs. \u201cAsking for financial help from those I know makes me feel scared and sad but blessed,\u201d this person wrote. \u201cThank God I now have food stamps which I had never known I was eligible for until this year.\u201d\n\nMany readers described watching their living situations deteriorate \u2015 mold, blocked drainpipes, an oven that didn\u2019t work for a year \u2015 even as their rents kept increasing. \u201cWe went from paying $1,200 a month for a two bedroom duplex to $1,675 for the same duplex in a matter of three years,\u201d wrote a reader in San Luis Obispo, California. Frustrated with the rising rent and a landlord who refused to make any fixes, she and her husband moved farther from town. Now, they\u2019ve learned their new landlord is selling their home out from under them.\n\n\u201cMy husband is a software engineer and I have a master\u2019s degree,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe have a good income, but we still struggle because of student loans.\u201d They\u2019ve been careful about taking on credit, which means their credit scores aren\u2019t high enough to qualify for a mortgage. \u201cThat\u2019s the stupidest thing I\u2019ve ever encountered,\u201d she said.\n\nGetty Commercial\n\n\u2018I Will Not Raise A Child In Someone Else\u2019s Basement\u2019\n\nOne surprisingly common trade-off people said they made was to delay or decide against having children because of the unbearable costs of housing.\n\n\u201cI will never be able to afford a place where a child could live and be educated properly,\u201d wrote a reader in Madison, Wisconsin, whose rent went from one-quarter of the salary for a public service lawyer 10 years ago to more than half today. \u201cI work double the hours for less pay. I changed jobs for opportunities I thought would lead to merit-based pay raises and promotions. Turns out I was wrong.\u201d\n\nA reader in New Jersey said she was renting a basement apartment with her husband since his parents moved away and couldn\u2019t house them anymore. \u201cMy husband and I will not have children in our current housing situation,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI understand you\u2019ll never have enough money for kids, but I will not raise a child in someone else\u2019s basement. I will not bring a child into our family when we live paycheck to paycheck and barely have enough to meet our basic needs, let alone the medical emergencies we run into. Sometimes being a good parent is knowing not to have them.\u201d\n\nMany respondents said they couldn\u2019t afford a home in the neighborhood where they grew up. \u201cWe can only have one child because we cannot afford a three-bedroom home in our city,\u201d wrote one person in Denver. \u201cIf we wanted to have two children we would need to move 80 miles from our work.\u201d Another New Jersey resident said that he and his family have \u201cno affordable options\u201d to remain in their current city \u2014 the only place he\u2019s ever lived \u2014 and that \u201cthe demands from my wife that we move away to an area more affordable [have] caused some very tense moments in our marriage.\u201d\n\nBut the most heartbreaking was the reader who said she has been homeless since January. \u201cMy children live full time with their dad who is financially stable with an income of well over $100,000 a year,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThey unfortunately are not allowed to see me because I don\u2019t have a place to bring them to.\u201d Though she works in Bloomington, Minnesota, she drives 20 minutes away to sleep in her car every night, because the police will arrest her if she stays within city limits.\n\nThe Washington Post via Getty Images\n\n\u2018It\u2019s CONSTANT Anxiety\u2019\n\nEconomists have documented the growing insecurity of the American economy for years, and our readers have been living through it. In nearly every response, someone mentioned fearing homelessness, eviction, a job loss or a medical bill. Homeowners said their greatest fear was an unexpected home repair and increasing property taxes. Renters worried about losing their subsidized housing. Rural residents feared the costs of car maintenance. One reader said her greatest worry was that she would not be able to remain in her home after her husband died.\n\nMany readers had already scaled down their lives and were worried that one more hit to their finances would be the final straw. \u201cI was forced to live in an unlivable apartment because my house got foreclosed [on] and this is all my dad and I can afford,\u201d said one respondent. Another, a teacher in New Jersey, wondered if her salary will increase at the same rate as the health care costs and pension contributions that are draining out of it. \u201cAs a single woman renting and also house-hunting, I\u2019m shocked at what\u2019s out there in my price range,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI\u2019m basically looking at all foreclosures, and many of them need repairs that aren\u2019t worth the upfront cost of the house.\u201d\n\nThe greatest anxieties came from renters. \u201cOur apartment is owned by a large corporation,\u201d one wrote, \u201cand I fear our rents will continue to rise even as the apartment complex falls apart. It\u2019s CONSTANT anxiety. I worry every time they even plant a new bush that it will eventually be factored into our rent increase next year.\u201d\n\nBloomberg via Getty Images In Seattle, an economic boom has pushed rents and home prices relentlessly upward.\n\n\u2018Is This The American Dream?\u2019\n\nThe final theme that came out in the responses was anger and frustration at the political decisions that have created the housing crisis.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s completely unaffordable! I go to school full-time and work two jobs and it would be impossible to live on my own. Is this the American dream?\u201d wrote one respondent, a student at the University of San Diego. Others noted the barriers to building houses in big cities, the lack of subsidies for affordable housing and the tiny percentage of cities that offer rent control.\n\nWe also heard a lot about how the housing crisis intersects with other social issues like inequality, racial discrimination and climate change. \u201cMy neighbors in Oak Park won\u2019t be able to continue to live here,\u201d worried one Sacramento, California, resident. \u201cI worry about affordability and displacement of low-income families as Sacramento grows and changes,\u201d wrote another. Others mentioned housing for undocumented students and housing investments being made in already wealthy neighborhoods.\n\nSome of the anger was directed at the right or the left, but most was aimed upward at plutocrats and corporations. \u201cThere is no longer a direct relationship between how hard one works and prosperity,\u201d wrote the respondent who said she only eats once per day. \u201cI see people working incredibly hard to put money into the pockets of the very few. [...] All other needs are at risk due to the expanding demands of shelter and housing in America.\u201d\n\nAlongside all of these challenges, though, some readers offered a bit of levity. \u201cWhat is your greatest complaint about your housing situation?\u201d our survey asked.", "THE ASSOCIATED PRESS A \"for rent\" sign outside an apartment building in Sacramento, California. There is often a deep power imbalance between landlords and tenants. A number of ratings sites aim to change that.\n\nThe downtown apartment had everything Tony Cellante and his college friends were looking for: plenty of space, a good price and close enough to New York\u2019s nightlife to stumble home.\n\nJust before signing on the line, however, he happened to run into the departing tenant. What followed was a telling account of the \u201cnightmare\u201d landlord: about him entering the unit whenever he liked, regularly removing furniture and frequently adding extra charges onto the rent.\n\nCellante avoided the apartment but the encounter planted a seed in the back of his mind: \u201cI thought to myself, \u2018Shouldn\u2019t everyone just be able to run into the old tenant of the place they want to rent?\u2019\u201d\n\nThat was nine years ago, when Cellante was a student at Binghamton University in upstate New York. Soon after graduating, he partnered with a college friend to create the website Review My Landlord. As the name suggests, the online platform invites people to post their views about their landlord or property manager.\n\nTen years after the financial crisis \u2015 precipitated by the subprime mortgage collapse \u2015 more than 36 percent of U.S. families live in rental housing \u2015 the highest proportion in the last half-century.\n\nAs the ranks of renters expand, so too does public attention to the power imbalance between tenants and landlords. A new study by the Washington, D.C.-based Urban Institute, for example, finds that renters experience higher levels of material hardship and are less likely to have emergency savings than their home-owning peers.\n\nLandlords, on the other hand, are among the wealthiest demographic in the U.S. Yet the services they offer all too often leave their clients disgruntled. One recent online study into negative public sentiment puts bad landlords above taxes and adultery.\n\nFor Cellante, review websites like his represent an opportunity to even out a market that \u2015 despite anti-discrimination legislation such as the Fair Housing Act \u2015 seems to tip the scales consistently in favor of landlords\u2019 interests.\n\n\u201cThere is a big power mismatch in today\u2019s rental market, but it doesn\u2019t have to be that way,\u201d says Cellante, whose website clocks several thousand new reviews every month.\n\nHe is not the only one to think that way. Recent years have seen the emergence of a growing number of similar tenant-focused websites, with notable examples including Whose Your Landlord, Rate My Landlord and Rentlogic.\n\nGiving tenants a greater voice is welcome, of course, but can it really level the U.S. rental market? Hypothetically, yes. Your landlord persistently refuses to fix the leaking toilet, you post a scathing review and the next renter knows to go somewhere else.\n\nIdeally, the outcome is less combative, says Ofo Ezeugwu, founder of Whose Your Landlord. In a perfect world, just the threat of being named and shamed would be enough to persuade landlords to up their game.\n\nTemple University Ofo Ezeugwu, the founder of Whose Your Landlord, hopes even the threat of being called out publicly will lead landlords to treat renters better.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s hard to hide something that is out there in the public domain,\u201d Ezeugwu reasons.\n\nWhile testimonials to this effect litter these sites, perhaps the strongest proof of their impact is the stiff pushback from landlords. Ezeugwu says he has been threatened with lawsuits \u201chundreds of times\u201d \u2015 a claim echoed by Cellante.\n\nYet to really reset the power dynamics in the rental market, it takes more than a few disgruntled renters logging on to rant.\n\nWhen it comes to reviews, volume counts. Whose Your Landlord carries over 12,000 reviews from 225 U.S. cities, but, as with its competitors, the lion\u2019s share of them are focused on the country\u2019s largest metropolises and student towns.\n\nThere is a demographic bias as well. The majority of traffic to these review sites comes from digital-savvy millennials. That\u2019s only natural: high prices, student debt and a lack of money for a deposit are among the reasons young adults are far more likely to rent than buy. But, even so, it still leaves other segments looking bare.\n\nThese are essentially problems of scale, which can be fixed if and when the habit of rating your landlord really takes off. Other problems are harder to fix, such as the natural bias toward complaining about bad landlords (rather than commending good landlords) and the lack of updated information about landlords between rental periods (tenants typically post after they have given back the keys).\n\nThe threat of landlords kicking out tenants who criticize them or even suing them for defamation is also very real, says Eric Goldman, a law professor at Santa Clara University: \u201cSome landlords are thin-skinned, so they react poorly to any public criticism, warranted or not.\u201d\n\nOne way around the limitations of reach and the legal liability of reviewers is to use a more objective system.\n\nThis is the tack adopted by Rentlogic, which has developed an algorithm based on publicly available data (typically, complaints to the city housing authority) to rate apartments across New York City.\n\nRentlogic\u2019s automated system currently grades 1.1 million apartment buildings, with scores between A and F. The worst grades are granted only when a municipal inspector confirms the validity of a renter\u2019s complaint \u2015 an event that usually precipitates a fine as well.\n\n\u201cThis information acts like a verified \u2018micro-review\u2019 and so it is user-generated, but there is a higher barrier of entry to place the complaint and it\u2019s further validated by a third-party source,\u201d says Yale Fox, founder of Rentlogic, which successfully completed a recent $2.4 million round of funding.\n\nThis move away from the subjective reviews to rely more on existing complaint systems is one that housing authorities \u2015 and tenants associations, in particular \u2015 welcome.\n\nCorianne Scally, a senior researcher at the Urban Institute, expresses a common hesitation about review sites replacing more formal checks against bad landlords.\n\nHer concerns are especially for renters on low incomes. Not only do they often lack either the time to shop around or enough rental options to have a genuine choice, she says, but they are unlikely to use these websites for \u201cthe kind of information they need most\u201d \u2015 which, basically, boils down to the cost.\n\nAccording to the National Low Income Housing Coalition\u2019s latest annual report, someone earning the federal minimum wage would need 2.5 jobs just to afford to rent a modest one-bedroom apartment.\n\nCouple this income-to-rent disconnect with a demand-supply imbalance and you have a market ripe for landlord abuse of low-income renters. Discrimination against holders of government-granted housing vouchers remains commonplace, for instance, with county authorities in cities such as Milwaukee only recently prohibiting such practices.\n\nTHE ASSOCIATED PRESS Tiny houses at a homeless encampment in Seattle. In the absence of legislation to provide incentives for the acceptance of Section 8 vouchers, politicians and advocates have been scrambling to keep up with the surge of unsheltered residents in the state.\n\n\u201cIf there is real discrimination going on, then they shouldn\u2019t report it on websites but through the proper legal channels,\u201d Scally adds.\n\nThe rejoinder from the sector\u2019s advocates is that an honest review at least means that people can now walk into a new rental with their eyes open. Whose Your Landlord goes a step further, offering tenants advice on practical issues via blogs and podcasts.\n\nEarly next year, the New York City-based site is also preparing to publish guides for tenants on specific neighborhoods in the city. With a view to helping enhance immigrant renters\u2019 rights, these \u201crenters\u2019 commandments\u201d will be published in Russian, Mandarin and Spanish, as well as English.\n\nFor Ezeugwu, the Whose Your Landlord founder, the end goal of all landlord rating services is to increase \u201chousing literacy\u201d and generally improve life for both sides \u2015 renter and landlord.\n\n\u201cAt the crux of the platform are landlord reviews, but the idea of sharing transparent information is what creates trust,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd trust is what ultimately builds stronger communities.\u201d\n\nFor more content and to be part of the \u201cThis New World\u201d community, follow our Facebook page.", "HuffPost\n\nLet\u2019s talk turkey. If you\u2019re a zealot like myself, you\u2019ve already planned out your Thanksgiving menu, tested any newcomers to your spread, and written a shopping list for when you head to the grocery store ready to throw elbows for the best bird. However, if you haven\u2019t given your holiday table any thought yet, not to worry. I\u2019ve taken the initiative to break down how to get the juiciest, most golden turkey you\u2019ve ever had.\n\nCall it a brine of the times, but I challenge you to make this the year you brine your turkey. If you\u2019ve never done it before, it\u2019s an easy way to add some much-welcomed flavor and moisture to your centerpiece dish. And if you have done it, I\u2019m here to offer you my version, which I\u2019m naturally inclined to say is the best.\n\nSo the first question you may have is, \u201cwhat is a brine?\u201d Simply put, it\u2019s a solution of salt water in which you submerge (typically lean) meats overnight. The salt allows the proteins in the meat to absorb water, which is then retained after it cooks to make for a juicier end product. But that\u2019s not all! Since it\u2019s a salt solution, the brine seasons your turkey inside and out \u2015 no matter how much salt you rub on the outside, there\u2019s no other way to season the center of a 12-pound bird.\n\nIf you\u2019re up for the challenge, let\u2019s go through the process. My brine is a salt and sugar solution flavored with apple cider, lemon, rosemary, thyme and garlic. Adding aromatics to your brine helps take your turkey to the next level, letting all these holiday flavors infuse the meat. I add the salt, sugar and aromatics to a saucepan with the apple cider and a little water to dissolve, before adding ice water to cool it down (you don\u2019t want to cook your bird when you throw it in). All you need to do is throw your turkey in a tall stock pot with the brine fully covering the bird.\n\nThe next morning, you\u2019ll pull the turkey out and pat it dry with paper towels on a sheet tray. An important, often-overlooked step is to throw it back in the fridge uncovered to dry out the skin for a few hours. This is key to getting that crisp golden skin you crave. The final step is to pull out your bird at least an hour before cooking to let it come to room temperature (this helps it to cook evenly) and rub it down with butter.\n\nNow you\u2019re ready to roast: I start the turkey in a roasting pan at 450 degrees Fahrenheit for 20 to 30 minutes to get golden and then drop the temperature to 350 degrees until it\u2019s cooked through. Foil is your friend during this process. The second you see that skin getting too dark, tent it with foil to preserve that precious poultry skin.\n\nDry turkey should now be a distant memory, never to return again to your holiday table \u2014 something your family can truly be thankful for.\n\nJake Cohen\n\nThe Ultimate Brined Turkey\n\nYield: 8 to 10 servings\n\nPrep Time: 30 minutes, plus overnight brining, drying and resting time\n\nCook Time: 2 hours\n\nTotal Time: 2 hours and 30 minutes, plus overnight brining, drying and resting time\n\n18 cups cold water, divided\n\n2 cups apple cider\n\n1 1/2 cups kosher salt, plus more to taste\n\n1 1/2 cups granulated sugar\n\n6 sprigs rosemary\n\n6 sprigs thyme\n\n1 head garlic, halved\n\n1 lemon, sliced\n\nOne 12-pound turkey, trussed\n\n4 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened\n\n2 tablespoons all-purpose flour\n\nFreshly ground black pepper, to taste\n\n1. In a small saucepan, heat 2 cups of water with apple cider, salt, sugar, rosemary, thyme, garlic and lemon over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring often, until the salt and sugar have dissolved, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a large stock pot and stir in the remaining 16 cups cold water. Submerge the turkey and refrigerate overnight.\n\n2. The next day, remove the turkey from the brine and dry well with paper towels. Place turkey on a sheet pan and refrigerate for 2 hours. Remove from the refrigerator and let temper at room temperature for 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\n3. Rub the turkey liberally with the softened butter and place in a roasting pan. Roast, rotating halfway through until the breasts begin to get golden, 20 to 30 minutes. Reduce the heat to 350 degrees F and continue to cook, basting every 30 minutes, until golden and a thermometer reads 165 degrees F when inserted into the thigh, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. (If the breasts begin to get dark at any point, cover with foil and continue to cook.)\n\n4. Remove from the oven and transfer to a large cutting board; let rest for 15 minutes.\n\n5. To make the gravy, strain the pan drippings into a bowl and let sit for 5 minutes to let the fat rise to the top. Pour the fat into a small saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in the flour and cook until a blonde paste forms, 2 minutes. Slowly whisk in the remaining pan drippings and bring to a simmer. Cook until thickened, 5 minutes, then season with salt and pepper. Keep warm.\n\n5. Carve the turkey (you can reserve the carcass for stock). Arrange on a platter and serve with gravy.", "Jimmy Kimmel called on President Donald Trump to fire White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders for sharing a doctored video. And he had an idea about what should happen to her next.\n\nKimmel was among many who said Sanders should resign over the incident, which began with a testy exchange on Wednesday between CNN reporter Jim Acosta and Trump. While Acosta was speaking, a female intern tried several times to pull the microphone away from him. At one point, his hand appeared to brush hers as she again grabbed for the microphone.\n\n\u201cPardon me, ma\u2019am,\u201d Acosta said, then tried to continue with his questions.\n\nBut Sanders shared a doctored video of the incident that originated with Infowars, or what Kimmel called \u201ca website for the mentally unbalanced,\u201d to make the incident look worse and revoked Acosta\u2019s White House press pass.\n\nKimmel slammed what he called her \u201cHuck-B.S. machine.\u201d\n\n\u201cJim Acosta clearly never touched that White House intern.

The two blazes ranged from 2,000 to 10,000 acres, according to Cal Fire. Authorities shut down part of the 101 Freeway as plumes of smoke cascaded into the air on Thursday.\n\nAt least 30 homes had already erupted in flames in the area by early Friday, KTLA reported.\n\n\u201cThe first part of this fuel bed had not seen fire for many years.

Earlier this year, the Temple\u2019s 9-foot tall, 1-ton bronze statue of Baphomet was displayed in front of the Arkansas State Capitol to protest a Ten Commandments monument that already resides on the grounds.\n\nThe Temple, which describes itself as a \u201cnontheistic\u201d religious and political activist group, was offended that Baphomet was presented as a \u201csymbol of evil\u201d in \u201cSabrina,\u201d according to the suit. The image of Baphomet is used to represent the devil in the streaming series.\n\nBut Satan \u201cis a literary figure symbolic of the eternal rebel in opposition, rather than the personalization of evil,\u201d per the Temple. A key tenet of members and supporters of the Temple is that Satanists deserve as much protection and respect as followers of any religion.\n\nThe Temple \u201ccommissioned ... Baphomet ... to be a central part of its efforts to promote First Amendment values of separation of church and state and equal protection,\u201d the complaint stated. \u201cDefendants\u2019 prominent use of this symbol ... associated with evil, cannibalism and murder blurs and tarnishes\u201d the Temple\u2019s Baphomet.\n\nThe suit also emphasized that the entertainment companies \u201cblatantly misappropriated\u201d and \u201cunquestionably copied\u201d its statue. Baphomet was traditionally represented as a figure with female breasts and no children, per the suit.

The FDA\u2019s planned restrictions, first reported by The Washington Post and confirmed to Reuters by the official, do not apply to vape shops or other specialty retail stores.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS The ban means only tobacco, mint and menthol flavors can be sold in convenience stores and gas stations.\n\nThere has been mounting pressure for action after preliminary federal data showed teenage use had surged by more than 75 percent since last year, and the FDA has described it as an \u201cepidemic\u201d.\n\n\u201cE-cigs have become an almost ubiquitous \u2012 and dangerous \u2012 trend among teens,\u201d FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in September. \u201cThe disturbing and accelerating trajectory of use we\u2019re seeing in youth, and the resulting path to addiction, must end. It\u2019s simply not tolerable.\u201d\n\nThat growth has coincided with the rise of Juul, whose sales of vaping devices grew from 2.2 million in 2016 to 16.2 million devices last year, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe agency threatened in September to ban Juul and four other leading e-cigarette products unless their makers took steps to prevent use by minors. The FDA gave Juul and four big tobacco companies 60 days to submit plans to curb underage use, a compliance period that is now ending.\n\nThe planned restrictions on flavors in convenience stores are likely to have the biggest impact on Juul, which sells nicotine liquid pods in flavors such as mango, mint, fruit and creme, previously called creme brulee.\n\nThe only other e-cigarette competitors sold at convenience stores are those marketed primarily by tobacco companies such as Altria Group Inc, British American Tobacco Plc, Imperial Brands Plc and Japan Tobacco Inc .\n\nThose products, sold under the MarkTen, blu, Vuse and Logic brands, have lost market share as Juul has risen to prominence over the last year, growing from 13.6 percent of the U.S. e-cigarette market in early 2017 to nearly 75 percent now, according to a Wells Fargo analysis of Nielsen retail data.\n\nE-cigarette products represent a small share of revenue for major tobacco companies, whereas Juul\u2019s business is built entirely on the vaping devices. Revenue from e-cigarette devices made up less than 1 percent of British American Tobacco\u2019s global revenue for the first six months of 2018, according to a company filing from July.\n\nAltria last month announced it would stop selling its pod-based electronic cigarettes, generally smaller devices that use pre-filled nicotine liquid cartridges, in response to the FDA\u2019s concerns about teen usage. The company also said it would restrict flavors for its other e-cigarette products to tobacco, menthol and mint.\n\nRepresentatives from Altria, British American Tobacco, Imperial Brands and Japan Tobacco did not respond to requests for comment Thursday evening. A Juul spokeswoman declined to comment.\n\nThe companies have previously said their products are intended for adult use and that they work to ensure retailers comply with the law.\n\nJuul has previously said the company wants to be \u201cpart of the solution in keeping e-cigarettes out of the hands of young people\u201d but that \u201cappropriate flavors play an important role in helping adult smokers switch.\u201d\n\nMeredith Berkman, a founder of Parents Against Vaping E-cigarettes, which seeks to curb underage use, said the agency\u2019s move was a \u201cgood first step,\u201d but added that \u201cthe final step should have happened yesterday.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy not do away with flavors altogether, why not do away with online sales altogether?\u201d she said.\n\nE-cigarettes have been a divisive topic in the public health community.

It serves hard truths you can\u2019t look away from, and it does so in the blackest way ever.\n\nHBO recently renewed Nance\u2019s series, \u201cRandom Acts of Flyness,\u201d for a second season. The show, which premiered in August, interrogates the way we view race, gender, romance, trauma and oppression through vignettes, weaving in and out of darkness and humor (and often dark humor) to do so.\n\nIt gets real in the most surreal ways. It\u2019s a show born of unapologetic free black expression. It doesn\u2019t adhere to the boundaries society aims to place on non-white art. Instead, it tears them down and dances around them as if they had a chance in the first place. To Nance and his team, that expression was second nature.\n\n\u201cThe show is, whether or not it feels like it, the most natural and easy kind of creative expression that we could come up with,\u201d Nance told HuffPost at CultureCon in New York City in October. \u201cI don\u2019t think it was in any way us trying to be strange or radical or provocative in any substantive way. I think that the reality is that [HBO] wanted to do this show because they wanted to see what our most natural state was in that way.\u201d\n\nScenes in the first season include a woman\u2019s natural hair getting arrested for being \u201cbad,\u201d an ancestry service that connects black people with the white people who owe them reparations, an artificial intelligence service that prevents you from staying too woke, a trans man discussing the utility of gender and the power of affirming his masculinity, and several instances of Nance himself getting stopped and questioned by a cop while filming.\n\n\u201cRandom Acts of Flyness\u201d has proved to be more than a show; it\u2019s an experience that offers extensions to the content it provides on the television screen. An example of that is a website exclusively dedicated to calling out the white savior trope in film, whitepeoplewontsaveyou.org. Upon visiting the site, one is given the option to play a roughly half-hour video in which scenes from popular American cinema play (including \u201cGlory,\u201d \u201cAvatar\u201d and \u201cThe Help\u201d) as a choir repeatedly sings \u201cWhite people won\u2019t save you,\u201d in an almost haunting way. Nance described this as a piece of \u201ccounter-propaganda.\u201d\n\n\u2033[There\u2019s a] common lexicon for how to propagandize this idea that white people will save you and are inherently equipped, culturally and emotionally, to save black people, Asian, people of color generally,\u201d Nance told HuffPost.\n\nHe emphasized Hollywood\u2019s influence, noting that the implication of these tropes \u201cbears out in what type of decisions we make when we vote for people, when we watch certain shows, when we support certain types of white people or cave for certain types of white people.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s based in a idea that white people have an inherent desire to, in a self-sacrificial way, commit acts of heroism on our behalf,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt is counterproductive, and even masochistic, to conduct your life in a way that believes that or assumes that. It\u2019s really just trying to propagandize the opposite so that you can live in truth and hopefully make better decisions in terms of your relationships with black people and white people. Just people in general. Especially decisions that affect your life from a sociopolitical standpoint.\u201d\n\nDating back to his debut feature, \u201cAn Oversimplification of Her Beauty,\u201d Nance has had a knack for challenging the way audiences think about identity and the \u201csubjectivity of truth.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if he thinks his work is ahead of its time, Nance said no.\n\n\u201cKind of the heart of that question is: Is the stuff I\u2019m talking about ... is culture ready to process it in the way [we] intend? I don\u2019t think that there\u2019s any kind of way of really knowing that, because the meaning of anything that you make changes contextually with time in a way you can\u2019t determine, so whether or not people can understand the reference points, it\u2019s not a function of if they\u2019re watching it now, like today or a hundred years from now.

The Walker campaign called the magazine\u2019s managing editor \u2014 my boss\u2019s boss \u2014 and complained that I couldn\u2019t write about the governor because I had signed the recall petition three years earlier. The managing editor was furious with me for failing to disclose my actions as an unemployed 22-year-old. I was terrified, sure that I was going to get fired.\n\nThat\u2019s the type of guy Walker is. He governed Wisconsin with the same vindictive pettiness, transparent corruption and laser-like focus on further oppressing already marginalized people that we now see in the Trump administration (there\u2019s a word for this style of governance.) He was the sad, preservative-laced ham sandwich in the otherwise unassuming brown paper bag of Wisconsin politics. He would tell you, unconvincingly, that he needs his black and orange Harley Davidson jacket when he is about to go into a controlled slide on his hog. He is Miracle Whip personified. He\u2019s the kind of guy who\u2019d call your boss\u2019 boss to try to get you fired.\n\nNow he\u2019s the one out of a job.\n\nBeneath his corn-fed, \u201caw shucks\u201d facade, Walker is one of the most conniving figures to emerge from conservative politics in the past decade.\n\nWalker\u2019s loss on Tuesday night had a sort of poetic justice: After the 2016 election, Walker and Republicans in the state legislature passed a rule tightening the state\u2019s recount law. The new law requires that candidates must lose by 1 percent or less to ask for a recount. On Tuesday, Walker lost the governorship to State Superintendent Tony Evers by 1.1 percentage points.\n\nWalker and his allies will surely consider the devastation he brought to Wisconsin over the past eight years a success. Taken together, Walker\u2019s legacy adds up to eight years of ruin for Wisconsin\u2019s working classes, for people of color and for the environment \u2014 all in service of further enriching the already-rich.\n\nBeneath his corn-fed, \u201caw shucks\u201d facade, Walker is one of the most conniving figures to emerge from conservative politics in the past decade. It will take decades to repair the damage he and his allies did to my home state. And much of what he broke can never be made whole again.\n\nThroughout his two terms as governor, Walker has remained consistent in his core political strategy: promising jobs that will never appear. Look at Walker\u2019s election-year gambit: to bring Taiwanese electronics manufacturer FoxConn to Wisconsin with promises of well-paying, high-tech jobs for Wisconsin workers.\n\nReality has not lived up to those expectations. FoxConn promised to create 13,000 jobs at its Wisconsin factory at an average salary of $53,875. In exchange, Walker\u2019s administration awarded FoxConn more than $3 billion in state tax breaks and credits \u2014 equaling more than $230,000 per job the company promised. Walker could have used that money to fund a public works program to employ more than four times as many people, at the same salary, for the same cost of the FoxConn deal.\n\nLet\u2019s just say that, under Walker, Wisconsin underperformed its Democrat-run cousin, Minnesota, on nearly every meaningful metric: Non-farm job growth. Median income. Population growth. Median hourly wages. The share of people with health insurance.\n\nI suspect that one reason Walker failed so badly is that although he is conniving to his core, he is not smart. Think back to when he took a prank call from someone pretending to be David Koch. Or when, as Milwaukee County executive, he signed a letter to a Jewish constituent with, \u201cThank you again and Molotov.\u201d Or when he claimed he got his bald spot from bumping his head on a kitchen cabinet door. Walker has a Ph.D. in power lust and an \u201cI tried!\u201d sticker in political acumen.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t even good at hiding his corruption. During his campaign for governor, while serving as county executive, Walker\u2019s staff set up a secret wireless router in his public office to communicate about the campaign using taxpayer resources. One of Walker\u2019s aides at the time was sentenced to six months in prison for felony misconduct.\n\nWalker was a cheap date for corporate executives in search of friendlier laws. A John Doe investigation revealed that after a billionaire lead producer gave $750,000 to a conservative group supporting Walker and his party in the 2012 recall elections, Walker and his party passed a measure that retroactively shielded paint makers from liability.\n\nSo, on Tuesday night, Walker did what he has always done, from the moment he decided to pursue a career in politics: He failed. I hope some of his supporters, including some of my own family members, will now wake up to the fact that they were duped.", "Say it ain\u2019t so, Joe.\n\nWhile participating in an Instagram Q&A session, Joe Russo, the co-director of Marvel\u2019s highly anticipated and still-untitled \u201cAvengers 4\u201d film, revealed a bit of what to expect from the follow-up to \u201cInfinity War.\u201d The most surprising reveal during the interview might be when we\u2019ll see a trailer.\n\n\u201cYou may or may not see it before the calendar turns 2019,\u201d Russo said.\n\nThe trailer for \u201cAvengers: Infinity War\u201d came out in November 2017, and the film was released April 27 (its original release date was May 4). Similarly, \u201cAvengers 4\u2033 is scheduled to come out May 3, 2019, so people have just assumed a teaser would come out this month, but now that\u2019s up in the air.\n\nRusso was also asked if the stakes would be higher in the next \u201cAvengers\u201d film. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d he said. \u201cOne hundred percent. I mean, the highest of any of the films to date. Without question.\u201d That\u2019s quite a statement given that the stakes in \u201cInfinity War\u201d were the death of half of all life in the universe.\n\nRusso also revealed that, though they\u2019re only halfway through the editing process, the current runtime for the film is about three hours. He says that might not hold, but if it does it would make it the longest Marvel movie ever made.", "WASHINGTON \u2015 The White House on Thursday defended disseminating a manipulated video identical to one posted by a conspiracy theory website that has falsely claimed the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre never happened.\n\nThe site, InfoWars, has been a longtime supporter of Donald Trump\u2019s, and Trump has reciprocated the admiration with an interview when he was running for president. One noted presidential historian, meanwhile, called the episode a low point in White House press relations.\n\nPress secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders posted the 15-second clip on her Twitter account late Wednesday night as justification for banning a CNN reporter who asked questions that President Donald Trump did not like. After Trump told Jim Acosta \u201cThat\u2019s enough, that\u2019s enough,\u201d a White House intern tried to grab a microphone away from the reporter.\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders sent out this manipulated video on her official White House Twitter account late Wednesday night.\n\nThe identical 15-second clip had been posted two hours earlier by an InfoWars editor. It shows the incident in wide-angle view, and then five more times in close-up.\n\nSanders announced in a press release distributed at 8 p.m. Wednesday \u2015 and in a series of five tweets posted a few minutes earlier \u2015 that the White House was confiscating Acosta\u2019s Secret Service-issued press credentials that permit entry into the White House complex. Her statements came about a half hour after Diamond and Silk, two YouTube-based Trump supporters, advocated that Acosta\u2019s badge be pulled during an appearance on the Fox Business channel.\n\nTrump is known to watch a great deal of cable television, especially Fox channels, and to make decisions apparently based on that information.\n\nThe White House did not respond to multiple queries about the origin of the video. Nor did it say whether the urging by Diamond and Silk played a role in the decision to punish Acosta.\n\nIt also would not explain why press officers managing Wednesday\u2019s news conference asked the intern to try to wrestle the microphone away from Acosta, rather than just turning it off remotely from the board that controls the audio.\n\nDouglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University, called the White House\u2019s response \u201cunprecedented\u201d in the modern era. \u201cThis is President Trump targeting Acosta because he asks tough questions. That\u2019s not the way you\u2019re supposed to be running a press operation,\u201d he said.\n\nAcosta responded almost immediately to Sanders\u2019 statement on Twitter, calling it \u201ca lie.\u201d Shortly afterward, CNN said: \u201cIn an explanation, Press Secretary Sarah Sanders lied. She provided fraudulent accusations and cited an incident that never happened. Jim Acosta has our full support.\u201d\n\nThe point of yesterday\u2019s session was merely to antagonize Trump\u2019s ... favorite bogeyman, the free press, in order to keep them galvanized and everyone else distracted in the wake of a stinging political defeat. Ned Price, a former official in the Obama administration\n\nWhy Trump even called on Acosta, whose reporting he has long complained about, is unclear. Ned Price, a spokesman for the National Security Council under President Barack Obama, said Trump\u2019s intention at the press conference was clearly to rile up his political base after his party lost control of the House in Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections.\n\n\u201cHad it been a true effort to inform the American public, the president would\u2019ve announced the removal of his attorney general. Instead, he appears to have lied about it when asked,\u201d Price said. \u201cThe point of yesterday\u2019s session was merely to antagonize Trump\u2019s and his supporters\u2019 favorite bogeyman, the free press, in order to keep them galvanized and everyone else distracted in the wake of a stinging political defeat. Mission accomplished.\u201d\n\nIn her statement Wednesday evening as well as a new one Thursday, Sanders claimed that Acosta\u2019s credentials were pulled because of his interaction with the female intern who tried to take away the microphone.\n\n\u201cWe will, however, never tolerate a reporter placing his hands on a young woman just trying to do her job as a White House intern. This conduct is absolutely unacceptable,\u201d Sanders wrote Wednesday night.\n\nOn Thursday, she wrote: \u201cThe question is: Did the reporter make contact or not? The video is clear, he did. We stand by our statement.\u201d\n\nBut a review of the video clearly shows that Acosta did not place \u201chis hands on a young woman\u201d \u2015 but, rather, that he moved the mic away from her as she tried to grab it and that his left hand briefly came into contact with the crook of her elbow as he gestured toward the president.\n\nInfoWars editor Paul Joseph Watson posted this to his Twitter account on Wednesday evening.\n\nIn the clip originally posted by InfoWars\u2019 Paul Joseph Watson, the zoomed-in video stops as Acosta\u2019s hand touches the intern\u2019s arm, making that contact appear more forceful than it does in the longer wide-angle clip.\n\nInfoWars did not respond to a HuffPost request for comment.\n\nAymann Ismail, a staff writer and former video producer at Slate.com, wrote that the zoomed-in video appears to slow down and then speed up, which also makes the contact appear more energetic than it was. He wrote later that the effect could have been the result of the video being downloaded and shifted to a different frame rate, rather than due to malicious editing.\n\nInfoWars is a conspiracy theory site best known for claiming \u2015 falsely \u2015 that the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting was staged and that the 20 elementary school children and six staff gunned down there were actually alive and well somewhere. The site and its operator, Alex Jones, are being sued by parents of those children for defamation.\n\nThe site is also known for its sales of dubious vitamin supplements (\u201cBrain Force Plus.\u201d \u201cSuper Male Vitality.\u201d) and is a strong supporter of Trump and white nationalist politics generally. Trump was interviewed by Jones in December 2015 when he was still just a candidate in the GOP presidential primaries. He told the conspiracy theorist, \u201cYour reputation is amazing. I will not let you down.\u201d\n\nBrinkley said that not even President Richard Nixon, who famously mistrusted the news media, tried to pull credentials from reporters. Nixon limited access \u2015 for example, he took only print journalists who had written favorable stories about him on his groundbreaking trip to China \u2015 but he did not restrict individual journalists\u2019 ability to do their jobs, Brinkley said."]
