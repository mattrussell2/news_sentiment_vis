Because the New York Times claims they \"could reshape the publishing landscape if successful,\" I wanted to test out the format for myself.\n\nI'm going to be honest with you. When the publisher mailed John Green's collection of flipbacks to me, I opened the package and laughed. What the hell was the point? I honestly didn't get it. To give you some perspective of the size, they're about the length of an 8 oz coffee mug.\n\nAnd because they're also referred to as pocket books, I wanted to see of these flipbacks could actually fit inside pockets.

This was one of the most annoying parts when I began to read \u2014 because you can see the text on the next page.\n\nBut for the sake of this experiment, I read the entirety of the first chapter. Surprisingly, the text is big enough to read. And the see through-ness of the pages aren't AS bad as you continue to read on.\n\nHere's a side by side comparision of the actual novel's text to the flipbook's text. The spacing is a little more cramped, but the size is about the same.\n\nBut I also wanted to get some opinions from my co-workers who were also casual readers, so I went around and asked them to touch/flip through/read this format and tell me their honest opinions.\n\nPablo: I\u2019m a fan of miniature things and think this is real cute. I wish this was more for novelty and read horizontally like a regular book (even if the words were tiny), but I can\u2019t knock \u2019em for thinking outside the box.\n\nPedro: I think it's great for people that love having physical copies of books, but also don't want to carry really big ones around. I like it!\n\nAsia: I actually kinda like it. It feels easy to read and carry around, and it's much lighter than my Kindle. It kinda reminds me of carrying around a little Bible.

I read the reviews first before buying it and there are a lot of complaints about it 'splashing cookie dough on the walls, so you should use a deep bowl, since the lowest speed is too high.' My answer to that? GREAT! That's exactly the power I want! I want a hand mixer to do the job, so I don't revert to my stand mixer all the time. I want power to be able to tackle many different types of food, not just a dozen types, but all kinds of things. If I wanted to buy a slow hand mixer, then I'd go to the lowest wattage one, which I owned 40+ years ago...it barely whipped mashed potatoes!

I was also concerned that there were only three speeds. But, in reality, what more do you need than slow/medium/fast? Some people have a problem that the slow isn't slow enough and flour in the bowl was flying up out of it? Maybe you need to use a bigger/taller bowl.

In the history of the Montreal Protocol, this is the most blatant violation of the treaty.\"\n\nThe UN says the Ozone Depletion report illustrates the success of the Montreal Protocol. The UN also says the positive outcome will be strengthened by the Kigali Amendment to the protocol, which will be set in motion next year.\n\nThe amendment will phase out hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), which were actually used in refrigerants and air conditioners to replace CFCs before scientists cottoned on to the fact that they act as a greenhouse gas, with a potency up to 4,100 times that of carbon.\n\nSo, does the ozone layer healing mean that climate change will slow down?\n\nWell no, not really.\n\nMorgernstern says that closing of the ozone hole will have only a \"moderate\" effect on climate change, as changes to the ozone layer only have a minimal effect on global warming.\n\n\"The amount of global warming avoided because these CFCs disappear is measured in a few tenths of a degree,\" said Morgernstern.\n\n\n\nMorgernstern says the UN report represents a promising environmental outcome and that if ozone didn't exist \"there would've been no land-based life forms on the planet\".", "Did you know you can sign up for a BuzzFeed Community account and create your own BuzzFeed posts?

He claims publisher Nationwide News defamed him in two articles and a poster by painting him as a pervert, a sexual predator who committed sexual assault while acting in King Lear, and by suggesting his conduct was so serious that the STC pledged to never work with him again.\n\n\n\nNationwide News has argued a defence of truth based on the testimony of Eryn Jean Norvill, who played the role of King Lear's daughter Cordelia in the production, and alleges Rush sexually harassed her during the run of the play. She did not participate in the Telegraph's stories and was not named in them.\n\nHanding down his judgement on Tuesday morning, Wigney said the proposed defence would have brought up new claims about incidents that allegedly occurred \"many years before 2016\" and do not involve Norvill, the King Lear production, or the Sydney Theatre Company.\n\nThere is a suppression order on the name of Witness X and the details of her proposed evidence.\n\n\n\nNationwide News argued the evidence from Witness X was capable of supporting the truth of some of the defamatory imputations pleaded by Rush that are not specific to the production of King Lear, including the suggestions that he engaged in scandalously inappropriate behaviour in the theatre, that he engaged in inappropriate behaviour of a sexual nature in the theatre, and that he is a pervert.\n\n\n\nWigney said the new evidence could not have won the case for Nationwide News, as it only pertains to some of the imputations pleaded by Rush, but that it had the capacity to mitigate damages awarded to Rush if it was found to be true.\n\nWigney said the prejudice caused to Rush by the application would be \"not merely unfortunate or regrettable\" but rather \"manifest and palpable\".\n\n\n\nIf the application had been allowed, he said, he would have had to adjourn the case until April due to Witness X's and his own availability, which he said would have caused \"considerable stress and anxiety\" to Rush and his wife Jane Menelaus.\n\nRush, who spent two and a half days in the witness box, would also have to be recalled to give evidence, Wigney said.\n\nHe said weighing up the application was \"by no means an easy exercise\", but he ultimately determined the delay, the fact the trial would be effectively divided into two parts, and the \"egregious prejudice\" this would cause to Rush outweighed the importance of the evidence.\n\n\n\nThe Telegraph launched the shock mid-trial bid to amend its defence and introduce the new witness on Tuesday last week, but it was not argued until Friday afternoon, at which point all but two witnesses in the case had already given evidence.\n\nWigney said the Telegraph had attempted to contact Witness X from as early as December 2017, making more attempts throughout 2018, but she had either not responded or told them she didn't want to talk.\n\nHe went on to say that it appears Witness X decided to offer to testify after seeing media coverage of the trial, and engaged solicitor Leon Zwier, who is also acting for Norvill.\n\nZwier contacted Nationwide News lawyers on October 26 to tell them Witness X was prepared to testify, the court heard.\n\nWigney noted this chronology but said the applications had \"unquestionably been made at an extremely late stage of the trial\".\n\nWigney also said that Rush had been clear throughout the trial that he wanted a fast resolution to vindicate his reputation, and that Nationwide News had \"frustrated and impeded\" him at \"every opportunity\".\n\nAll witnesses in the case have now given evidence.

Acredita-se que o atentado seja o ataque mais mortal contra judeus na hist\u00f3ria dos EUA. O ataque levou o Museu Memorial do Holocausto dos EUA, em Washington, D.C., a lembrar ao p\u00fablico \"os perigos do \u00f3dio e antissemitismo descontrolados, que devem ser enfrentados onde quer que apare\u00e7am\".\n\nJeff Swensen / Getty Images Ora\u00e7\u00f5es em um memorial na segunda-feira.\n\nQuando os nazistas invadiram sua casa, em 1941, no que hoje \u00e9 a Litu\u00e2nia, Bastacky tinha apenas alguns meses de idade.

O ideal \u00e9, na hora de escolher, perguntar direitinho sobre esses eventuais custos extra, saber o que acontece se alguma roupa for danificada e tudo o mais.\n\nUsar os looks da Roupateca, e tirar muitas fotos com eles, acabou sendo uma parte bem divertida das f\u00e9rias (que j\u00e1 estavam incr\u00edveis!). Algumas da pe\u00e7as eu amei tanto que queria ter para sempre e talvez um dia compre algo parecido, mas percebi que n\u00e3o doeu me separar delas.

Either way, I'm here to tell you about some pretty exciting news from my dear friend, ClassPass\n\nWhat is ClassPass ? Well, it's a fitness membership that provides access to a network of studios around the globe. You can take cycling classes, strength-based classes, yoga, pilates, boxing, and so much more!\n\nAbove is a screenshot from the app on my phone. You can see a couple of my past classes and some achievements!\n\nThe more credits you pay for per month, the more classes you can take. For New York classes (where I'm located), the average class is nine credits. You can book classes directly through the app, keep track of upcoming classes, star your favorite gyms, connect with friends, rate classes after they're completed, and get access to ClassPass Live . What's ClassPass Live? It's a streaming service that lets you access workouts if you can't actually be there in-person.\n\nHow does it work? It's pretty simple. It's a credit-based system, meaning you choose the amount of credits you wish to pay for per month. With those credits, you sign up for whatever classes your heart desires via the ClassPass app\n\nOnce your free two weeks is over, you'll have the option of going into a billable membership. Prices range based upon what city you're in , but for New York, $45 per month equals 25 credits and $75 per month equals 45 credits. If you really want to dive in and take multiple classes a week, $160 per month gives you 100 credits!\n\nYES, TWO FREE WEEKS!!!!! This means that for two weeks, you'll get a 45-credit plan . This equals 4\u20136 classes depending on what classes you choose. Classes range in credit value for various reasons. Classes at peak times tend to be worth more credits (think: before work in the morning, after work in the evening, morning classes on a weekend). Also, classes using special equipment may be worth more credits since it's a smaller amount of people that can workout at once (think: cycling, pilates reformer).\n\nNow it's time for that bit of exciting news I mentioned earlier (insert drumroll here). ClassPass is offering a *2-WEEK FREE TRIAL* so you can test it out and see how you like it!\n\nNow you may be thinking, \"But what's so special about ClassPass?\" Below is a list of great features that make this fitness membership worth it, IMHO:\n\n\u2022 The plan is flexible. You choose when you want to workout and where.\n\n\u2022 You can try a slew of different types of workouts. Feel like boxing? Sure. Wanna try a HIIT-based workout? Go ahead. Never taken an aerial fabric ribbon class before? Now you can.\n\n\u2022 You can workout anywhere! Traveling to another state for work? No problem. Taking a vacation and want to book a class while there? Totally possible.\n\n\u2022 ClassPass will recommend classes based upon your goals if you're feeling stumped on what to try next.\n\n\u2022 Tons of ratings and reviews are available so you can check up on a class before actually signing up.\n\n\u2022 You'll get access to the ClassPass community to stay in touch with friends and instructors. You can also visit the community blog for info about classes, food tips, and so much more!\n\n\u2022 If you need to take a break from ClassPass, you can join the Lite program or put your membership on hold. The Lite program is the cheapest option, and therefore the least amount of credits.\n\n\u2022 If you run out of credits one month, you can purchase more individually or as a pack. And if you don't use all your credits in one month, they'll roll over up to 10 to your next month.\n\n\u2022 You can cancel any class up to 12 hours before without a late fee. If you miss a class without canceling, you will be charged a late fee within seven days of the class. This method holds you responsible!\n\n\u2022 The app comes with different achievement markers to help motivate you. For example, I just received a 50-class badge for completing 50 classes so far! You can see all your achievements in one convenient place and even share them on Facebook or Twitter.\n\n\u2022 There are no studio limits! If you really love one gym, you can visit that gym as many times as you want within one credit cycle.", "So tell us, what do you think we're all gonna regret in a few years?

At a cabinet meeting after last month\u2019s European council, the ministers believed they had secured commitments from May that the UK would be able to trigger a break clause to quit the backstop, that the EU\u2019s proposal for a backstop treating Northern Ireland differently from the rest of the UK would be torn up, and that the UK would not remain indefinitely in a customs union. Yet the two ministers told BuzzFeed News they are now concerned the UK is about to concede that it will not be able to unilaterally quit the backstop, that the Northern Ireland-only backstop remains in what they are calling a \u201cRussian doll backstop\u201d, and that it is now likely the UK will not leave a customs union with the EU after Brexit. They were reacting to Ireland\u2019s deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, who tweeted that \u201ca time-limited backstop or a backstop that could be ended by UK unilaterally would never be agreed to by IRE or EU\u201d. Coveney was backed up by Brussels negotiator Sabine Weyand, who retweeted him with the words \u201cStill necessary to repeat this, it seems.\u201d\n\nJack Taylor / Getty Images Brexit secretary Dominic Raab\n\nThe ministers said they believed they had a commitment from May that the UK would seek the \u201cunilateral ability to withdraw\u201d from any backstop arrangement. They interpreted this to mean the UK would secure a unilateral break clause for the backstop. May told them she would guarantee the UK could not be kept inside \u201cagainst our will\u201d. They now fear May will concede that such a decision could not be unilateral, and instead triggered only by legally determined review clauses, which would provide a set of objective criteria that would allow the UK to leave. On Monday, the Irish government said May and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar had discussed a \u201creview mechanism\u201d for the backstop, with Ireland insisting \u201cthe outcome of any such review could not involve a unilateral decision to end the backstop\u201d. A statement released by Downing Street made no mention of a \u201creview mechanism\u201d, stoking speculation that this will be the likely outcome, rather than a unilateral trigger.\n\nCabinet ministers are under pressure from Brexiteers to oppose a climbdown. Jeremy Hunt and Sajid Javid have called for the backstop to be time-limited, while Brexit secretary Dominic Raab privately demanded the right to pull the UK out of the backstop after three months and publicly said the arrangement must be \u201cfinite\u201d, \u201cshort\u201d, and \u201ctime-limited\u201d. Colleagues suggested Raab could concede on the backstop but then try to convince Brexiteers he had succeeded in keeping a Canada-style free trade agreement on the table. A source familiar with a draft version of the Future Economic Partnership told BuzzFeed News it leaves open the possibility of a Canada-type arrangement. Both ministers who spoke to BuzzFeed News also said they were concerned the Northern Ireland-only backstop would remain part of a deal with the EU, despite believing they had secured a commitment from the PM that she would not sign up to it. They said the PM promised them that the proposal for a temporary UK-wide customs arrangement meant the Northern Ireland-only backstop \u201cwould no longer be needed\u201d. The ministers took this to mean the Northern Ireland-only backstop would be removed from the deal, but they now believe the UK will concede on this. They suspect that language \u2014 \u201cno longer be needed\u201d \u2014 leaves May open to agreeing a deal based on a UK-wide customs union, with the Northern Ireland backstop then included as a fallback.\n\nTolga Akmen / AFP / Getty Images Taoiseach Leo Varadkar", "Did you know you can sign up for a BuzzFeed Community account and create your own BuzzFeed posts?

This should tell you about my unique size needs, how hard it is to get a well-fitting bra, and how important it is that things fit properly. I have the benefit of being in NYC, so I go to Intimacy, who professionally fit ladies, and who introduced me to this bra. I had been using the Panache Tango Balconette. Compared to that bra, this makes me look like I've had surgery. In addition to the look (this bra is much narrower than the Panache) the side support is soft and firm, and the wires are not located under the underarms, and so do not poke into my side boobs. The bra is soft and comfortable, I look *lifted* but not unnatural, and I feel well supported. From what I can see, most of the negative reviews are about the difficulty of fit. If at all possible, please get yourself fit in person to determine the size, and then come to Amazon to buy what you like in more colors for less money. There is no industry standard for bras, ladies, so just because you are one size in your old bra doesn't mean you are the same size in *any* other bras. There's no point in blaming the bra or the company \u2014 it's an industry problem. This bra is heaven.

J Cahill Memorial High School, raises her hand, as do two teachers.\n\nSteve Debenport / Getty Images A student (not at J J Cahill Memorial High School) raises her hand.\n\nLaw students from the University of New South Wales hand iPhones to the high school students and ask them to type words they associate with sexual harassment or sexual assault.\n\n\"Stalking\", \"Uncomfortable\", \"Consent\", \"Inappropriate\", \"Photos\", \"Scary\", \"Pressure\", \"Intimidating\". The words appear on a giant screen in real time and those entered the most frequently grow largest: \"Touching\", \"Unwanted\", \"Rape\". Amy Lin Lee, a fourth-year law student, explains the difference between sexual harassment, which is dealt with in civil law, and sexual assault, which is dealt with in criminal law. \"An important thing to remember is that not all sexual harassment equals sexual assault, but all sexual assault equals sexual harassment,\" Lin Lee tells the students. \"It is not just something that happens to girls, it happens to guys too.\" She explains that sexual harassment is any sexual action which can make you feel uncomfortable, ashamed or intimidated, while sexual assault includes inappropriate touching as well as rape. The students peel off into smaller groups. A circle of seven boys sits cross-legged on the floor and guesses whether scenarios involve sexual assault or sexual harassment. The facilitating law student, Michael Moryosef, describes a situation in which male students stick rulers up a girl's skirt. Nervous laughter ripples around the circle. Six of the seven boys correctly identify \"sexual assault\". The seventh insists it is harassment: \"They weren't bashing her!\" One of the female students, a 15-year-old, later tells BuzzFeed News this exact scenario had happened to her and her friends. \"And in primary school they used to pull up our skirts and put sticks up there,\" she says. \"I actually didn\u2019t know the difference between harassment and assault until today.\" When one boy is the first in the group to correctly differentiate between sexual harassment and sexual assault, he grins and dabs.\n\nKingsford Legal Centre\n\nThe boys are asked whether a woman who likes to wear short skirts is \"asking for it\" and deserves lewd comments. \"Is it sexual harassment?\" one boy asks, confused. \"But she's doing it for herself ... she's throwing herself out there?\" \"Maybe she could wear a longer skirt and a looser top then?\" one boy offers earnestly. \"If she's obviously getting stared at and stuff and she feels uncomfortable then don't wear that stuff again,\" one boy says. \"If she's going to keep wearing that, then that is on her.\" Moryosef asks if the boys think they should personally cover up from arm to ankle at the beach to avoid unwanted attention. They're all silent for a few moments. \"OK it is sexual harassment,\" they all conclude about the scenario. \"What if a girl asks for your number because she thinks you're cute on Instagram?\" one boy asks. \"Well I think what that comes down to is consent, and if it is unwelcome, that is where you have to stop,\" Moryosef says. \"Is it sexual harassment to ask a girl for a kiss?\" he asks. \"I'm confused.\"\n\nThe boys are bewildered by a scenario in which a \"not very sporty\" boy who has a lot of female friends gets called \"poofter\". \"There is nothing sexual about that at all!\" one boy exclaims. Moryosef asks how the boy who was being bullied might feel. \"Sad\". \"Uncomfortable\". \"Discluded\" [sic]. \"Disappointed\". One boy can't stop laughing. \"You'd find it funny if someone called your mate a poofter?\" Moryosef asks. \"It depends, if I know he doesn't care, then...\" the boy shrugs. \"What if you stand up for your friend and get bashed?\" one boy asks seriously. \"You shouldn\u2019t really care if you get called a faggot if you\u2019re hanging out with girls,\" one boy decides. \"If his friends are doing that then they\u2019re not really his friends.\"\n\nKingsford Legal Centre\n\nThey discuss whether it is OK to ask a female teacher about her love life. \"There is a line you don't cross,\" one boy says. \"How do you know where that line is?\" asks Moryosef. \"You know when a teacher is uncomfortable, you can see in their body language.\" The school's deputy principal John Mifsud says the free program, run by Kingsford Legal Centre, helps students to establish \"where they stand legally\" and also \"offer emotional support\" to each other. \"We don't really have the issue of sexual harassment or bullying of a sexual nature, but I think these kids are pretty worldly and know this happens in the community,\" Mifsud tells BuzzFeed News. \"I think it is an appropriate age for kids at 14, 15 and 16 to learn about this.\" A circle of girls is very interested in where the exchange of sexually explicit images falls into this discussion. \"If a photo gets out and it gets sent to someone, are they being sexually harassed?\" one girl asks. \"If I have someone's nudes and I leaked it would I get charged for it now, or when I'm an adult?\" another asks. The law student facilitating their discussion explains the circumstances in which \"sexting\"or sharing explicit images can be a crime \u2014 when it involves harassment, sharing the images without consent, or someone under 18. The girls talk about how they would feel if photos of them were sent to strangers. They tell BuzzFeed News that people send nudes to each other on SnapChat because it \"disappears straight away\". \"But then lots of people just take a photo of the screen with another phone so the person [sending the photo] doesn't know,\" one girl says. They describe a school meeting at which someone used AirDrop to send a \"a whole bunch of nudes\" to multiple students on their iPhones.\n\nBuzzFeed News UNSW law students and students from J J Cahill Memorial High School.", "H/t CableTV.com , which analyzed Google Trends data from the last five years to find out which movie each state loved the most.", "Get all the best Tasty recipes in your inbox!
