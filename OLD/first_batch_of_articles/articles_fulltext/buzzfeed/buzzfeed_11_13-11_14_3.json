I had a slow running drain in one of my bathrooms. My wife brushes her hair there so I was sure there was a hairball in the drain. I poked this thing as far as I could, up to the handle, down the drain, wiggled it around and pulled it out. Nothing. Tried again. Still nothing. Did this about four or five more times and still nothing. About this time I figured this thing was a waste of my time and a ripoff.\n\nThen for one last try I put this in from the other side of the drain and wiggled it around. Pulled it out and there was a hairball about the size of a mouse hooked on the bottom end of this thing. Tried again and got a little more hair. The next time nothing so I quit. I filled the sink with hot water and then pushed the lever to drain the sink. Watched the whirlpool as the water went down the drain. Saved the other two for next time.

He withdrew money from his savings account to buy the largest pumpkin he could find, along with several large bags of concrete mix. Then, he filled that puppy up and made a really pretty display.

Anyway, I took over the pick-up counter and placed his drink there with no words written on it. (It was a busy store with a lot of people waiting.)

One day my roommate, who had to be awake early, had enough and decided to piss on a metal pizza pan and stick it in the freezer. After a crazy party, he pulled the pan out and flipped it upside down, giving him a frozen disc of piss. He then slid that disc under their door, where it would melt on their fully carpeted entryway.

We had our own dog, and I took a week's worth of his land mines, plus the neighbor's dog's shits for the week, and walked across the street and threw them all over his front yard and walkway one night.

When I came home the next day and noticed that she was clearing her mess in an effort to find it, I decided not to tell her where the money was until our bathroom floor was spotless. Afterwards, I decided it would be too awkward to tell her the truth, so I left the money wadded up in her hamper. She was ecstatic when she found it on laundry day.

Well, a few days ago, I got home quite late, and there were zero spots open in my lot. The big truck was double parked again, but there was juuust enough room on their driver's side for me to sneak in there with my little clown car. I carefully pulled in, making sure not to touch anything. My passenger side mirror was half an inch from their driver's side door. I giggled to myself all the way back to my apartment and set an alarm and waited. The following morning, I woke up before the alarm to loud door slamming and stomping around. I looked out my window, and I saw the double parking culprit walking around both vehicles, taking pictures, texting someone, and taking more pictures. I was shaking with glee. They finally swallowed their pride, climbed in the passenger side and over the center console, and Austin Powers 20-point turned their butts out of the spot. I've never been so proud of myself and my shitty, petty, passive-aggressive ways.\" \u2014Here2Lol\n\n13. The fire hydrant fake out: \"When I was a kid my family lived in a house on a street with GIANT oak trees. Because of the slope of our yard, leaves from half the street would end up in the yard. My mother had really bad asthma and allergies and made us kids rake up the leaves. This was not an easy task. They would get several feet deep if we didn't do it often enough. One day we raked the whole yard into these giant piles for the city to come pick up. It took several hours. The next morning, however, they were scattered all over. We raked them again over several more hours, and it happened again. Apparently the neighborhood bully was knocking them over just to be a dick. The next time we made a super huge pile around the fire hydrant, hoping he'd kick them and hurt his foot. Nope, this time he decided to do a run and jump.\" \u2014kperkins1982\n\n14. The cooking lard cheesecake: \"At my previous job, we had separate refrigerators for different shifts, but our food was constantly being stolen or messed with. One day, my buddy and I decided to make a nice cherry cheesecake \u2014 out of cooking lard. We finished it off with a graham cracker crust and cut a couple of slices out of it since we knew the thief wouldn\u2019t be brazen enough to take the first bite.

None of the other accounts did, and I learned that somehow the No. 1 player \u2014 who worked there \u2014 had a hand in it. I waited until he played another game and watched as he put in his account code. I then waited 30 minutes until he was done, logged into his account, and tanked a game pretty hard.

I was young and not confident enough to confront them about it. But after a semester, I had had enough. One time before going out, I put my speakers up against our shared wall and blasted Enya\u2019s 'Only Time' on endless repeat. I also locked my door so they couldn\u2019t come in to turn it off.

One thing you might notice from this photo is that her skin is straight-up GLOWING. In fact, she always seems to have ~flawless~ skin and makeup.\n\n...see?! Anyway, I recently had the opportunity to jump on the phone with Lea to ask her about her skincare and beauty routine, and she divulged all her secrets. So, of course, I decided to see what it would be like to live by her beauty routine for a week. Could I achieve flawless, celebrity-worthy skin??? One could only hope.\n\nLet's take a look at exhibit B...\n\nTo start off, one of the pieces of advice Lea gave was this: \"Beauty begins from within, and you should always take care of the inside first. Make sure you're drinking enough water, getting enough sleep, and eating well.\" Which is always a great reminder!!! Our skin hates too much caffeine and little sleep.\n\nWashing my face every morning and every night was already a routine for me, so I gave the iS Clinical cleanser a shot. It's a lightweight cleanser that felt refreshing and not too drying on my sensitive skin. I felt ~fancy~ using it.\n\nOn top of getting enough sleep and eating well, Lea believes in taking vitamins in the morning. It was like I got to start my day with TWO pieces of candy since Olly's Women's Multi takes like sour strawberry \u2014 and it's a gummy. I'd rather eat two of these in the morning than swallow a GIANT-ASS vitamin.\n\nLea told BuzzFeed, \"I'll go to Shani Darden for facials \u2014 she's in Los Angeles. I'm a firm believer in taking care of your skin.\"\n\nView this photo on Instagram\n\nThis next part was my favorite by FAR. Because Lea receives facials from esthetician Shani Darden once a month, I contacted her to see if I would be able to experience a facial the way she does. Lucky for me, Shani had time to get me in!\n\nBy the way, Shani's No. 1 piece of skincare advice is to use sunscreen!!!!!\n\nDid I feel pampered? YES. Shani's facials are roughly an hour long, customized for each individual's skin type.\n\nDid I feel pampered? YES.

Eu tinha 21 anos e estava em uma loja de conveni\u00eancia. Eu s\u00f3 queria comprar algo gelado para meus irm\u00e3os beberem. Fiquei t\u00e3o surpresa com o modo casual com que ele questionou meu g\u00eanero que acidentalmente respondi: \u201cHomem!\u201d Depois, percebendo meu erro, acrescentei: \u201cN\u00e3o, n\u00e3o \u2013 mulher!\u201d Meu rosto corou enquanto eu levava as bebidas at\u00e9 o caixa. O estranho sorriu para mim, como se estiv\u00e9ssemos compartilhando algum segredo. \u201cCaaaara\u201d, falou, colocando seus \u00f3culos escuros, \u201cVoc\u00ea disse homem primeiro\u201d. Voltei em sil\u00eancio para o meu carro. Minha irm\u00e3 me perguntou, v\u00e1rias vezes, o que havia de errado. Contei a hist\u00f3ria a ela, rindo para mostrar que estava bem. Mas, segundos depois, quando dei a r\u00e9 para sair do estacionamento, bati na porta do passageiro de um sed\u00e3 cor creme. Ningu\u00e9m se machucou, mas ambos os carros ficaram bem avariados. Durante mais de uma d\u00e9cada, passei por diversas experi\u00eancias como essa: ser confundida com um homem em p\u00fablico. E, apesar de nem todas terem resultado em um acidente de carro, todas me deixaram desorientada e me perguntando qual pedacinho de minha identidade era respons\u00e1vel pelo \u201cei, mo\u00e7o\u201d equivocado.\n\n\n\nAlgumas vezes, eu dizia para mim mesma que era por causa da minha altura e o modo autom\u00e1tico que a maioria das pessoas associa altura com masculinidade. Outras, me perguntava se essa rea\u00e7\u00e3o era provocada por minha voz grave, minha roupa andr\u00f3gina ou meu cabelo curto. No entanto, sempre tive consci\u00eancia de que minha ra\u00e7a e meu g\u00eanero desempenhavam um papel importante nesses \u201cmal-entendidos\u201d. Vivi tempo o bastante nesse mundo para perceber que raramente as mulheres negras t\u00eam pleno acesso \u00e0 sua feminilidade. N\u00e3o foi coincid\u00eancia o fato de um cara branco qualquer em uma loja de conveni\u00eancia achar perfeitamente normal perguntar para mim se eu era ou n\u00e3o uma mulher.\n\nMpi / Getty Images A ex-escrava e abolicionista Sojourner Truth (1797\u20131883), originalmente Isabella Van Wagener.\n\n\u00c9 poss\u00edvel que Sojourner Truth nunca tenho feito a famosa pergunta que atribuem a ela. Ex-escrava, Truth ficou conhecida por seu discurso inflamado na Conven\u00e7\u00e3o dos Direitos da Mulher em Ohio (EUA), em 1851. Segundo uma transcri\u00e7\u00e3o do discurso feita por Frances Dana Gage, ativista dos direitos da mulheres, e publicada no jornal \"New York Independent\", em 1863, Truth v\u00e1rias vezes repete a pergunta ret\u00f3rica: E n\u00e3o sou uma mulher? No entanto, tamb\u00e9m h\u00e1 outra transcri\u00e7\u00e3o do discurso, escrita por Marius Robinson, rep\u00f3rter e amigo de Truth, em que a pergunta n\u00e3o aparece. Apesar de muitos historiadores acharem que a vers\u00e3o de Robinson \u00e9 provavelmente a mais fiel, ela \u00e9 a menos conhecida pelo p\u00fablico. Em vez disso, \u00e9 a itera\u00e7\u00e3o \u201c\u201cE n\u00e3o sou uma mulher?\u201d que muitos estudantes leem quando estudam pensamento feminista negro.\n\nA ideia de que mulheres negras n\u00e3o s\u00e3o femininas est\u00e1 enraizado na hist\u00f3ria dos EUA. \u201cSe as mulheres negras s\u00e3o estereotipadas como inabal\u00e1veis nos EUA, nossa pesquisa demonstra que h\u00e1 outro mito intimamente ligado a essa ideia e que ainda persiste: o de que as mulheres negras s\u00e3o menos femininas do que outras mulheres e, na verdade, chegam a ser emasculadoras\u201d, escreveram a jornalista Charisee Jones e a pesquisadora Kumea Shorter-Gooden em Shifting: The Double Lives of Black Women in America (Em Muta\u00e7\u00e3o: A Vida Dupla das Mulheres Negras na Am\u00e9rica, em tradu\u00e7\u00e3o livre). \u201cEsse mito era traduzido em personagens como Tia Jemina [personagem-s\u00edmbolo de uma marca de produtos culin\u00e1rios nos EUA. A figura de Tia Jemina \u00e9 baseada no estere\u00f3tipo das mammys, escravas que trabalhavam como bab\u00e1s e empregadas dom\u00e9sticas para fam\u00edlias brancas, principalmente no Sul dos Estados Unidos. Para efeitos de compara\u00e7\u00e3o, podemos fazer o paralelo com a personagem de Tia Nast\u00e1cia na obra de Monteiro Lobato] e Sapphire [o estere\u00f3tipo da mulher negra raivosa e castradora], depois evoluiu para o arqu\u00e9tipo da menina negra grosseira e atrevida, uma imagem onipresente na cultura popular (...) tais representa\u00e7\u00f5es possuem um peso incomensur\u00e1vel na psiqu\u00ea das mulheres negras, que em seu desejo de serem vistas como \u2018damas\u2019, para combater a no\u00e7\u00e3o de que s\u00e3o menos femininas, acabam adotando um modo de falar e um comportamento que n\u00e3o reflete quem realmente s\u00e3o.\u201d\n\nRichard Shiro / Getty Images Serena Williams representando a Sele\u00e7\u00e3o Americana, em Asheville, Carolina do Norte.\n\nMulheres negras s\u00e3o geralmente vistas como possuidoras de atributos associados \u00e0 masculinidade: somos \u201cfortes\u201d, \u201cindestrut\u00edveis\u201d, \u201cinvulner\u00e1veis \u00e0 dor\u201d. Uma pesquisa realizada em 2014 pelo site de relacionamentos OkCupid sobre os h\u00e1bitos de seus usu\u00e1rios revelou que 82% dos homens n\u00e3o negros tinham preconceito contra mulheres negras. Serena Williams (assim como sua irm\u00e3 mais velha, Venus) j\u00e1 foi comparada com um homem e teve de aturar as pol\u00eamicas sobre seu incr\u00edvel e bel\u00edssimo corpo durante quase toda a carreira. Leslie Jones foi alvo de insultos absurdos de cunho racista e sexista antes da estreia do filme Ca\u00e7a-Fantasmas. Uma funcion\u00e1ria p\u00fablica da Virg\u00ednia Ocidental achou que n\u00e3o havia problemas em chamar a ex-primeira dama dos EUA Michelle Obama de \u201cmacaca de salto alto\u201d. Uma mulher negra de 1,60m assustou tanto um homem branco (e bem mais alto) que acabou levando um tiro no rosto. Minha vida como uma mulher alta e de pele escura fez com que eu tivesse de enfrentar constantemente as no\u00e7\u00f5es de g\u00eanero imputadas a todas as mulheres negras, al\u00e9m de encarar o modo como internalizei muitas dessas ideias nefastas. Apesar de hoje poder dizer que exer\u00e7o minha feminilidade de um modo muito menos dependente de valida\u00e7\u00f5es externas, o caminho at\u00e9 essa convic\u00e7\u00e3o n\u00e3o foi nem um pouco f\u00e1cil. Passei muito tempo lutando com a pergunta \u201cE n\u00e3o sou uma mulher?\u201d \u2013 n\u00e3o por incerteza minha, mas por causa da aparente certeza do resto do mundo.\n\nNunca esquecerei a primeira vez em que fui confundida com um homem. Eu estava na Feira Estadual do Novo M\u00e9xico e era recruta em treinamento de uma academia militar particular em Roswell, Novo M\u00e9xico (EUA). Era nossa primeira folga \u2013 os cadetes podiam passar o dia inteiro fora do campus. Mesmo com a obrigatoriedade da utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o do uniforme, ainda seria um dia divertido.\n\nPassei muito tempo lutando com a pergunta \u201cE n\u00e3o sou uma mulher?\u201d \u2013 n\u00e3o por incerteza minha, mas por causa da aparente certeza do resto do mundo.\n\nEu estava andando com Lauren, uma amiga minha bonita, de pele clara e mais baixa, e metade do time de basquetebol masculino estava na nossa cola, todos loucos para pegar o telefone de Lauren. Chegamos at\u00e9 a \u00e1rea da barraquinha do \u201cTeste Sua For\u00e7a\u201d. Eu estava andando \u00e0 frente, os caras ficaram para tr\u00e1s, flertando com minha amiga. \u201cPode vir, cavalheiro!\u201d, gritou o atendente da barraca em minha dire\u00e7\u00e3o, com uma voz que s\u00f3 posso descrever como a de um locutor de circo. Fiquei morta de vergonha, torcendo para os caras n\u00e3o terem ouvido. Mas as risadinhas abafadas atr\u00e1s de mim acabaram com as minhas esperan\u00e7as. O atendente, nervoso, pediu mil desculpas e me ofereceu uma \u201cmartelada\u201d gr\u00e1tis. Acertei o grande bot\u00e3o escuro sem entusiasmo e, apesar de n\u00e3o ter chegado nem perto do \u201cMegaforte\u201d, o atendente me deu o primeiro pr\u00eamio \u2013 um cachorro de pel\u00facia de 1,20 metro. \u201c\u00c9 o uniforme\u201d, disse para mim enquanto eu me afastava, com o cachorro embaixo do bra\u00e7o. \u00c9 poss\u00edvel que dessa vez eu tenha sido confundida com um homem por causa do meu uniforme militar, quadrad\u00e3o e de corte reto. Mas, mesmo antes dessa experi\u00eancia, sempre achei que minha feminilidade nunca foi algo claramente estabelecido. Se as mulheres eram (supostamente) alvo de todas as maldades do mundo, por que nunca me acompanharam at\u00e9 em casa ap\u00f3s o baile da escola, como faziam com minhas amigas brancas no ensino m\u00e9dio? Por que me ensinaram a ser \u201cdurona\u201d e me rotularam como \u201cforte\u201d antes mesmo de eu entrar no ensino fundamental? Na inf\u00e2ncia, eu n\u00e3o entendia isso. N\u00e3o completamente, pelo menos. E as mulheres n\u00e3o precisam ser amazonas de pele escura (como eu) para terem de lidar com o policiamento de g\u00eanero. Em \"Fome\", a mais recente autobiografia de Roxane Gay, a autora detalha as in\u00fameras vezes em que estranhos n\u00e3o a viam como mulher por causa do seu peso. E as mulheres negras trans ou \u201cque parecem l\u00e9sbicas\u201d s\u00e3o as maiores v\u00edtimas de viol\u00eancia, incluindo o risco de morte, por causa do seu suposto g\u00eanero.\n\nKean Collection / Getty Images A feminista, abolicionista e reformista social norte-americana Frances Dana Barker Gage (1808\u20131884), por volta de 1840.\n\nTer sua feminilidade questionada e, posteriormente, desprezada \u00e9 algo que Sojourner Truth conhecia muito bem. Segundo Nell Irvin Painter, historiadora da Universidade Princeton e autora do livro Sojourner Truth: A Life, A Symbol (Sojourner Truth: Uma Vida, Um S\u00edmbolo, em tradu\u00e7\u00e3o livre), Sojourner nasceu no fim da d\u00e9cada de 1790 no norte de Nova York, recebendo o nome de Isabella dos pais, James e Elizabeth Baumfree, dois escravos de Johannes Hardenbergh. Sua vida nunca desviou muito das crueldades flagrantes da escravid\u00e3o na Am\u00e9rica: abuso sexual constante, p\u00e9ssimas condi\u00e7\u00f5es de vida, separa\u00e7\u00e3o familiar abrupta e arrasadora. Isabella ganhou sua liberdade em 1826 e alterou seu nome para Sojourner Truth em 1843.\n\n\u201cPensamos em Truth como uma presen\u00e7a natural e descomplicada em nossa vida como na\u00e7\u00e3o. Em vez de uma pessoa na hist\u00f3ria, ela funciona como um s\u00edmbolo. Para apreciarmos o significado do s\u00edmbolo \u2013 Mulher Negra Forte \u2013, n\u00e3o precisamos saber quase nada da pessoa\u201d, escreveu Painter. \u201cComo abolicionista e feminista, ela usou seu corpo e sua mente com um \u00fanico objetivo, representar fisicamente mulheres que tinham sido escravizadas. Num per\u00edodo em que a maioria dos americanos achava que os escravos eram todos homens e as mulheres eram todas brancas, Truth personificava um fato que ainda merece ser reiterado: entre os escravos, havia mulheres; entre as mulheres, havia negras.\u201d A maior parte dos relatos sobre Truth que datam daquela \u00e9poca s\u00e3o descri\u00e7\u00f5es impressionadas dos seus atributos f\u00edsicos. Para Harriet Beecher Stowe, autora de \"A Cabana do Pai Tom\u00e1s\", ela era a \u201cSibila L\u00edbia\u201d, uma refer\u00eancia \u00e0 profetisa norte-africana pintada na Capela Sistina por Michelangelo. No seu pref\u00e1cio ao discurso \u201cE n\u00e3o sou uma mulher?\u201d, Frances Dana Gage escreveu que Truth era uma \u201ccriatura estranha e maravilhosa\u201d, com uma \u201cconstitui\u00e7\u00e3o quase amaz\u00f4nica, chegando perto de 1,80 metro, cabe\u00e7a erguida e olhos que cortavam as nuvens, como em um sonho\u201d. A descri\u00e7\u00e3o de Gage ainda menciona o fato de Truth aparecer de bra\u00e7os nus, at\u00e9 os ombros, diante da multid\u00e3o. Essa \u00e9 a imagem de Truth que a maioria das crian\u00e7as americanas ver\u00e1 durante as aulas do breve M\u00eas da Hist\u00f3ria Negra: uma mulher negra alta e de pele escura, mostrando os m\u00fasculos como um halterofilista na praia. Seu corpo sendo um testamento ao modo como ela subvertia as no\u00e7\u00f5es tradicionais sobre feminilidade.\n\nQuando jogava basquete na faculdade, nos jogos fora de casa, quase sempre aparecia um babaca perguntando ao juiz se eu era realmente mulher, supondo em alto e bom som que eu tomava esteroides. Eu sabia que essas observa\u00e7\u00f5es eram feitas para me desconcentrar e geralmente fingia n\u00e3o ouvi-las, mas a verdade era mais complicada. Isso me magoava, mas tamb\u00e9m me deixava confusa: eu jogava com mulheres brancas t\u00e3o altas e fortes quanto eu. Por que esses caras n\u00e3o direcionavam seus insultos e esse policiamento da feminilidade alheia para elas? O que havia em meu corpo que atra\u00eda tanto esc\u00e1rnio e d\u00favida? \u201cA sociedade continua receosa de qualquer tipo de for\u00e7a feminina, ainda preferindo e abra\u00e7ando donzelas delicadas \u2013 um sentimento antiquado que limita todas as mulheres\u201d, escreveu Tamara Winfrey-Harris, escritora e feminista negra, em The Sisters Are Alright: Changing the Broken Narrative of Black Women in America (As Irm\u00e3s Est\u00e3o Bem: Mudando a Narrativa Deturpada de Mulheres Negras na Am\u00e9rica, em tradu\u00e7\u00e3o livre). \u201cMas como o rosto da donzela ainda \u00e9 visto como branco e feminino, isso torna-se um problema particularmente para mulheres negras. Enquanto a vulnerabilidade e a ternura forem a base do que \u00e9 aceito como feminilidade (e continuarem sendo um requisito para que a vida da mulher tenha valor), mulheres que s\u00e3o enxergadas como sobrenaturalmente indestrut\u00edveis por causa da sua ra\u00e7a n\u00e3o ter\u00e3o sua feminilidade reconhecida.\u201d Mesmo tendo como inspira\u00e7\u00e3o artistas extremamente inovadoras como Grace Jones \u2013 exuberante em seus trajes que desafiavam as conven\u00e7\u00f5es de g\u00eanero \u2013, eu ainda ficava receosa ao atravessar o campo minado da feminilidade. Quando era mais jovem, queria um corte pixie como o de Nia Long, mas ficava nervosa com um poss\u00edvel aumento no n\u00famero de \u201cei, mo\u00e7o\u201d que receberia. Ficava nervosa de ser encarada durante muito tempo durante meus alongamentos no basquete. Porra, at\u00e9 tinha vergonha do fato das iniciais do meu nome serem HE (ELE, em ingl\u00eas). Gostaria de n\u00e3o ter passado tanto desconforto com a representa\u00e7\u00e3o do meu g\u00eanero na \u00e9poca \u2013 al\u00e9m disso ter sido uma fonte significativa de ang\u00fastia, perdi v\u00e1rias oportunidades de comprar smokings irados em brech\u00f3s.\n\nHarry Herd / Redferns / Getty Images Grace Jones no Festival Popular de Common em Southampton Common.\n\nEu tenho de fazer muito para \u201cprovar\u201d que sou feminina e compensar minha \u201cnegritude\u201d (manter o cabelo longo, a voz suave, usar roupas femininas), enquanto as mulheres brancas ou de pele mais clara possuem muito mais liberdade para experimenta\u00e7\u00f5es. Diane Keaton e Cara Delevingne \u201cbrincam\u201d com o estilo tomboy. Quando uma estrela do cinema branca adota um corte pixie ou mais curto, ela \u00e9 gamine ou elegante. Claro, mulheres negras podem e adotam esse visuais e cortes de cabelo andr\u00f3ginos, mas eles s\u00e3o percebidos de uma maneira diferente em nossos corpos: elegante se transforma em militante, boyish vira m\u00e1sculo. A \u201cnegritude\u201d, principalmente quando ligada ao corpo negro de uma mulher, \u00e9 majoritariamente reconhecida como masculina. \u201cEnquanto as mulheres brancas de classe m\u00e9dia do per\u00edodo pr\u00e9-Guerra Civil eram consideradas \u2018anjos da casa\u2019 \u2013 belas, devotas, castas e delicadas \u2013, as mulheres negras eram encaradas como feras das plantations que n\u00e3o precisavam ter seus corpos, sensibilidades e virtudes protegidas. Apesar da economia americana do s\u00e9culo 19, baseada na escravid\u00e3o, ter dependido dessa distin\u00e7\u00e3o, essa vis\u00e3o bestial permaneceu muito tempo depois do fim da servid\u00e3o\u201d, escreveu Winfrey-Harris. Os pilares da feminilidade branca s\u00f3 se sustentam quando somos constantemente lembrados de sua sombra: a mulher negra forte e masculina.\n\nO relato estridente e demagogo de Gage sobre o discurso \u201cE n\u00e3o sou uma mulher?\u201d de Truth \u00e9 muito diferente do que foi recontado por Robinson, que escreveu sobre o mesmo discurso em 1851, poucas semanas depois da realiza\u00e7\u00e3o da conven\u00e7\u00e3o. Atuando como secret\u00e1rio na conven\u00e7\u00e3o, Robinson escreveu que Truth pediu licen\u00e7a para falar \u2013 muito diferente da postura agressiva retratada por Gage. A verdadeira Sojourner Truth \u201ctinha orgulho de falar um ingl\u00eas correto e opunha-se \u00e0s vers\u00f5es de seus discursos no carregado dialeto sulista\u201d, escreveu Painter. Na verdade, a l\u00edngua \u201cmaterna\u201d de Truth era o holand\u00eas, aprendido na \u00e9poca em que servia \u00e0 fam\u00edlia Hardenbergh, e muito provavelmente ela n\u00e3o teria aprendido o ingl\u00eas se n\u00e3o tivesse sido vendida para a fam\u00edlia Neely, que falava ingl\u00eas, aos 9 anos de idade.\n\nOs pilares da feminilidade branca s\u00f3 se sustentam quando somos constantemente lembrados de sua sombra: a mulher negra forte e masculina.\n\nA aus\u00eancia mais marcante na vers\u00e3o de Robinson do discurso de Truth \u00e9 a pergunta \u201cE n\u00e3o sou uma mulher?\u201d. Painter observou que, apesar de ser poss\u00edvel que Robinson n\u00e3o tenha prestado aten\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 pergunta uma vez, \u00e9 muito improv\u00e1vel que isso tenha acontecido quatro vezes (o n\u00famero de vezes que ela \u00e9 repetida na vers\u00e3o de Gage): \u201cA interpreta\u00e7\u00e3o de Gage do discurso de Truth \u00e9 muito mais dram\u00e1tica do que o relato direto de Marius Robinson em 1851. Por meio da idealiza\u00e7\u00e3o e da elabora\u00e7\u00e3o, ela transforma os coment\u00e1rios de Truth em uma performance espetacular quatro vezes maior do que a vers\u00e3o dele.\u201d Gage queria escrever algo dram\u00e1tico \u2013 n\u00e3o necessariamente relatar a verdade. N\u00e3o foi Truth quem sentiu a necessidade de perguntar \u00e0 multid\u00e3o, majoritariamente branca, se ela era considerada uma mulher \u2013 foi Gage. Escrevendo para competir com Harriet Beecher Stowe e para promover sua pr\u00f3pria causa, como defensora do direito das mulheres, ela criou a caricatura de Sojourner Truth que a maioria das pessoas conhece hoje. Incapaz de vincular um conceito de for\u00e7a \u00e0s mulheres brancas, que eram o foco principal de sua luta, Gage apostou que o corpo negro e \u201cforte\u201d de Truth convenceria seus leitores de que as mulheres n\u00e3o eram t\u00e3o delicadas assim, a ponto de n\u00e3o poderem compartilhar os direitos e privil\u00e9gios dos homens. Ela precisava do s\u00edmbolo de Sojourner Truth para ganhar essa batalha: um relato honesto levando em conta a complicada humanidade de Truth n\u00e3o serviria.\n\nCerta vez, quase briguei com um cara no bairro de Lower East Side, em Nova York, ap\u00f3s ele me chamar de homem. Era 2014, sete anos ap\u00f3s o atentado de 11/9. Eu e outra amiga est\u00e1vamos saindo de um show burlesco em uma noite quente de ver\u00e3o. Um homem come\u00e7ou a nos seguir, berrando sobre sua destreza sexual \u00e0 minha amiga, que o ignorava solenemente. Eu tinha certeza que ele perderia o interesse depois de um tempo, mas aquilo continuou por tr\u00eas quarteir\u00f5es. Ent\u00e3o parei e o encarei. \u201cOlha, cara, ela n\u00e3o quer falar com voc\u00ea\u201d, eu disse. Ele n\u00e3o tirou os olhos de mim. \u201cQue porra, voc\u00ea \u00e9 um homem?\u201d, ele vociferou. \u201cIsso, eu sou a porra de um homem\u201d, respondi. E dei um tapa na cara dele. A \u00faltima vez que eu tinha brigado com algu\u00e9m tinha sido na quinta s\u00e9rie, e aqui estava eu, estapeando um estranho no meio de Nova York. Passamos os pr\u00f3ximos minutos discutindo, eu e o cara. Ele estava constrangido e queria brigar. Minha amiga tentava, sem muito sucesso, me tirar dali. Eventualmente, cada um seguiu o seu caminho, mas passei o resto da noite pensando sobre a pergunta do cara e a minha resposta. Fiquei me perguntando o porqu\u00ea de eu assumir t\u00e3o prontamente a identidade que o cara imp\u00f4s a mim, o porqu\u00ea de eu ter ficado t\u00e3o irritada a ponto de agredi-lo fisicamente. A noite poderia ter acabado de uma maneira muito pior do que acabou. N\u00e3o tinha mais como fingir que esse tipo de coisa n\u00e3o me afetava. No dia seguinte, trabalhei como volunt\u00e1ria em um evento beneficente sem fins lucrativos que ensinava autodefesa. Coincidentemente, neste ano o evento seria uma \u201cmaratona de socos\u201d no Prospect Park: uma grande roda de pessoas, a maioria mulheres, socando o ar ritmadamente. Enquanto eu socava o ar, pensava sobre a noite anterior. Nos \u00faltimos sete anos, me identifiquei verbalmente como homem duas vezes. Na primeira vez, foi um equ\u00edvoco. Mas, na \u00faltima, foi porque eu sabia que o homem parecia n\u00e3o me ver de outra maneira. Por quanto tempo eu ainda teria de anular minha feminilidade apenas porque isso era algo que o mundo esperava de mim?", "I was a little nervous at first, but then I remembered they showed off a little of their their acting skills in their \"Walk It Talk It\" video with Drake and was instantly at ease.

They have both been charged with aggravated sexual assault, causing actual bodily harm and depriving liberty, over the alleged events early in the morning of March 27 at the Shangri-La Hotel in Sydney.\n\nOn Wednesday Local Court magistrate Beverley Schurr denied an application for the woman at the centre of the case, who cannot be identified, to be compelled to give evidence at the committal hearing.\n\nThe committal hearing in the Local Court will determine whether Gao and Wang stand trial over the charges in the District Court.\n\nLawyers for Gao had argued they needed to cross-examine the woman over matters including what they say are inconsistencies between her police statements about the alleged assaults, and inconsistencies between her account and security camera footage from the night.\n\nThey also said they wanted to question her over when she said Gao had left the hotel room, and whether or not she had in fact consented to sex with Gao and Wang.\n\nThe prosecution argued that inconsistencies either did not arise, or were irrelevant to the alleged events in the hotel room, and the other issues did not amount to special reasons.\n\nSchurr ruled that the woman did not have to give evidence at committal as none of Gao\u2019s arguments met the legal test, which requires special reasons for the alleged victim to testify in the interests of justice.\n\n\n\nShe said footage from the karaoke club allegedly showed consensual kissing and cuddling between the woman and Wang, and noted that consent to one kind of sexual behaviour is not evidence of consent to another kind of sexual behaviour.\n\nShe also said that unlike some similar cases in which the complainant had been compelled to give evidence at committal, there was \"no evidence of retraction by the complainant\" in this case.\n\nAfter Schurr handed down her judgement, Gao\u2019s barrister John Korn said he would consider whether or not to apply to the Supreme Court to review the decision.\n\nInternational media and curious onlookers have descended on the various hearings in the case over the past six months, leading to courtrooms so full that people have sat on the floor or stood around the edges of the room.\n\n\n\nAs people entered Sydney\u2019s Central Local Court on Wednesday afternoon, they were warned by sheriffs to not film on the courthouse stairs, and repeatedly asked to turn off their mobile phones while in the courtroom.\n\nKorn also told Schurr that the sheriff\u2019s department had made clear the unusual amount of interest in the matter and was wondering \u201cif we can assist them\u201d by excusing Gao from court mentions.\n\nThe court registry told BuzzFeed News Gao will not be required to appear at the next mention so long as his lawyers are there.\n\nGao was granted bail in July this year under conditions including electronic monitoring, and resides in a Chatswood apartment with his wife Xuan Dong, also an actor, and their young daughter. Wang was refused bail.\n\nThe matter is next in court on November 23.", "Amazon\n\nPromising review: \"I use this to make my daughter's baby food. I previously used a saucepan with steam bucket attachment, but I found it to be quite inconvenient to stand around watching the pot when I have other things to do. This steamer is the perfect solution to that problem! I was able to steam four chopped sweet potatoes, eight peeled and chopped carrots, and an entire bag of fresh spinach. It took approximately 20 minutes total to steam all three different vegetables separately. Each vegetable turned out fork tender. I used a small food processor to puree them and then froze them all into cubes for easy storage. This steamer makes homemade baby-food making so simple!

It was voted down 32 to 12. During the debate Greens senator Larissa Waters said O'Sullivan should be ashamed of himself. \"Senator O'Sullivan needs to get his hands and his rosaries off my ovaries and those of the 10,000 Queensland women who have an abortion each year, 10,000 women who have the right to make a decision about their own bodies without the opinion of senator O'Sullivan getting in their way,\" Waters said during the debate.\n\nShe later withdrew the comment after Liberal senator Eric Abetz objected. O'Sullivan claimed it was these comments, which he characterised as \"attacks\", that prompted him to declare himself a woman on Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\u201cI am going to declare my gender today, as I can, to be a woman and then you'll no longer be able to attack me.\u201d\n\nThe Queensland senator said that centre-right conservative politicians, such as himself, can't say the word abortion without being \"attacked\" by the Greens. \"We can't open our traps, you cannot say the word abortion without being attacked by this mob of almost \u2014 I'd say grubs if I didn't think you were gonna make me withdraw it, Mr Acting Deputy President, but it's out there now,\" O'Sullivan told the Senate. \"These people come and attack me for my religious basis the other day, using words like rosary beads, because I had the audacity to raise issues around late-term abortions where babies that are only minutes away from getting a smack on the arse and a name are being aborted under the policies of the Australian Greens.\" A later-term abortion is one performed at or after 24 weeks' gestation. According to the most recent figures from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 0.7% of abortions were carried out at or after 20 weeks. Most (94.6%) abortions in Australia take place before 13 weeks of gestation. O'Sullivan said the purpose of his comments was to \"call out\" the \"vomit\" and \"vitriol\" of the Greens.\n\n\"I will not stand silent, I will not stand mute while these people continue to marginalise policies and ideas ... that I think are largely supported still by the majority of the nation.\" O'Sullivan claimed making the gender \"declaration\" wasn't the reason he came into the chamber, but BuzzFeed News understands he was telling people that he was planning the stunt on Tuesday.\n\nHere's the video of Nationals senator Barry O'Sullivan saying he is declaring his gender \"to be a woman\" so the left-wing people can no longer \"attack\" him over his anti-abortion views. https://t.co/YzbOCWp0YC", "Share On more Share On more\n\nMore", "Did you know you can sign up for a BuzzFeed Community account and create your own BuzzFeed posts?

O programa seria uma revolu\u00e7\u00e3o, onde m\u00e9dicos poderiam acessar, em quest\u00e3o de segundos, dados de sa\u00fade e de tratamentos dos usu\u00e1rios do SUS na capital de Mato Grosso do Sul.\n\nDez anos depois, o Gisa tem como \u00fanicos resultados concretos duas den\u00fancias de improbidade administrativa que tentam recuperar R$ 16 milh\u00f5es (valores corrigidos) gastos pelo Minist\u00e9rio da Sa\u00fade e pelo munic\u00edpio. Ele nunca saiu do papel.\n\n\n\nO respons\u00e1vel pelo Gisa \u2013 e alvo da Procuradoria que apura desde fraude em licita\u00e7\u00e3o a favores ilegais do fornecedor \u2013 \u00e9 o deputado Luiz Henrique Mandetta (DEM-MS), ex-secret\u00e1rio municipal e favorito para assumir o Minist\u00e9rio da Sa\u00fade no governo Bolsonaro.\n\n\n\nMandetta teve os sigilos banc\u00e1rio e fiscal quebrados e est\u00e1 com os bens bloqueados h\u00e1 cinco anos. A Procuradoria afirma que o fornecedor, que n\u00e3o entregou o servi\u00e7o, pagou uma viagem do ent\u00e3o secret\u00e1rio a Portugal e teria bancado ainda despesas de Mandetta com a loca\u00e7\u00e3o de avi\u00e3o privado durante a campanha eleitoral de 2010, quando ele foi eleito deputado federal pela primeira vez.\n\n\n\nNesta ter\u00e7a, o presidente eleito, Jair Bolsonaro, refor\u00e7ou a condi\u00e7\u00e3o de favorito de Mandetta, elogiando-o: \"Ele \u00e9 muito benquisto pelos m\u00e9dicos de todo o Brasil, a Frente Parlamentar da Sa\u00fade \u00e9 simp\u00e1tica a ele, que deixou um rastro de bons servi\u00e7os l\u00e1 em Mato Grosso do Sul.\"\n\n\n\nA informatiza\u00e7\u00e3o dos prontu\u00e1rios em n\u00edvel nacional \u00e9 uma das promessas de Bolsonaro.\n\nO rastro de mau uso do dinheiro p\u00fablico no Gisa, com suspeita de fraude, come\u00e7ou a aparecer em uma sindic\u00e2ncia da Prefeitura de Campo Grande em 2013, depois que o grupo de Nelson Trad Filho (PTB-MS), primo de Mandetta, deixou a prefeitura.\n\nA sindic\u00e2ncia sobre o Gisa, que reuniu oito volumes de documentos, foi o ponto de partida para uma investiga\u00e7\u00e3o do Minist\u00e9rio P\u00fablico Federal. Em 2015, a Procuradoria apresentou as den\u00fancias, mas at\u00e9 hoje elas n\u00e3o foram analisadas pela Justi\u00e7a.\n\n\n\nPrimeiro, subiram ao STF porque o deputado do DEM tem prerrogativa de foro, e, este ano, retornaram \u00e0 primeira inst\u00e2ncia porque os fatos se deram antes de ele ter sido eleito para o Congresso. Os bens dele e de outros suspeitos foram bloqueados em 2013 por meio de medida cautelar (provis\u00f3ria).\n\n\n\nDe acordo com o Minist\u00e9rio P\u00fablico Federal, houve favorecimento no edital para a implanta\u00e7\u00e3o do programa ao cons\u00f3rcio liderado pela empresa Telemidia & Technology International Com\u00e9rcio e Servi\u00e7os de Tecnologia Ltda.\n\nSegundo a investiga\u00e7\u00e3o, a empresa teve acesso \u00e0s regras da licita\u00e7\u00e3o, antes mesmo do edital ser publicado. Um dos ind\u00edcios de fraude \u00e9 que o or\u00e7amento apresentado pela empresa na licita\u00e7\u00e3o era exatamente igual ao montante de verba repassada pelo Minist\u00e9rio da Sa\u00fade, que j\u00e1 estava dispon\u00edvel pela Prefeitura de Campo Grande, naquele ano: R$ 8,1 milh\u00f5es.\n\n\n\nOutros concorrentes tamb\u00e9m foram desabilitados. A den\u00fancia afirma que a cl\u00e1usulas restritivas limitaram a concorr\u00eancia e a Telemidia venceu e assinou o contrato com a prefeitura, mesmo sem preencher requisitos do edital e at\u00e9 de ter apresentado documenta\u00e7\u00e3o falsa. Logo depois de assinar o contrato, a Telemidia subcontratou a empresa portuguesa Alert, embora o edital vetasse a terceiriza\u00e7\u00e3o.\n\nSegundo a Procuradoria, foi a Telemidia que pagou uma viagem de Mandetta a Portugal, em 2010, onde ele se encontrou com executivos da Alert. Menos da metade do servi\u00e7o pago pela Prefeitura de Campo Grande foi entregue pela Telemidia/Alert. Dos 12 m\u00f3dulos previstos no Gisa, somente dois tinham sido entregues plenamente em 2015 e outros dois de forma parcial. O programa acabou engavetado.\n\n\n\n\n\nA vers\u00e3o de Mandetta\n\nO BuzzFeed News n\u00e3o conseguiu falar com Mandetta. Em ocasi\u00f5es passadas, o deputado disse que o Gisa n\u00e3o ficou operacional por causa de briga pol\u00edtica com o prefeito Alcides Bernal, que sucedeu Trad na Prefeitura. Ele nega que tenha favorecido ou sido favorecido pela empresa contratada.Mandetta disse ao jornal Folha de S.Paulo que informou o presidente Jair Bolsonaro que existem as a\u00e7\u00f5es de improbidade, mas que n\u00e3o \u00e9 r\u00e9u porque a Justi\u00e7a.

This gives them a delicious caramelized flavor and makes them nice and tender.\n\nSo what makes his pie so special? Well, for starters, he CARAMELIZES his apples in a pan before he fills his pie with 'em.\n\nHis trick? He uses a tart dough instead of a pie dough \u2014 which is made with softened butter, eggs, sugar, and flour. The dough is much softened than a typical pie dough and bakes into the crispiest pie crust you've ever had.

Mix the sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg together. Peel, quarter, and core the apples, then cut into thick chunks. Place in a bowl and sprinkle with the spiced sugar to coat. Fry the apples in two batches: Melt half the butter in a wide, nonstick frying pan, add half the apple chunks, and fry over high heat until golden and caramelized around the edges, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl. Repeat with the remaining apples and butter. Let cool completely.\n\nPreheat the oven to 375\u00b0F. Roll out about half of the pastry on a lightly floured surface to about \u215b-inch thickness. Overturn an 8-inch pie pan on top of the pastry and cut out a rough circle slightly bigger than the pan. Line the pan with the pastry, lightly pressing down to remove any air pockets, then trim off the excess pastry. Roll out the remaining pastry into another circle, again slightly larger than the pan, for the top crust.\n\nSpoon the cooled apples evenly into the pie shell. Brush the rim of the bottom crust with a little water, then drape the top crust over the pie. Press down lightly to seal and trim off the excess pastry. Crimp the edges and brush the top with the egg wash to glaze. Use the tip of a knife to cut a small cross in the center so that steam can escape during cooking. Sprinkle with a little sugar.\n\nBake until the crust is golden brown and crisp, 35 - 40 minutes. Let stand for 15 - 20 minutes before serving.", "\"Look at that undereye situation!

Stan Lee was born Stanley Martin Lieber. 2. As a kid, he wanted to be a lawyer. 3. Stan began his career writing obituaries for newspapers, but his dream was to write great literary novels. 4. He adopted the pseudonym Stan Lee for his work in comics, because he didn't want to separate this career from the other one that he planned as a author. 5. Years later, he legally changed his name to Stan Lee. 6. The first hero who caught Stan's attention was the Scarlet Pimpernel, which was the name of a play about Percy Blakeney, who, during the French Revolution, was able to save French nobles from death by guillotine. 7. In 1941, he became acting editor of Timely Comics, which would go on to become Marvel Comics, at the age of 18. 8. In World War II, Lee was part of the team that created posters, signs, and even cartoons for the U.S. Army. His job classification was \"playwright.\"\n\n15. His career was marked by his ability to endow heroes with more human emotions. By Stan Lee's logic, just because someone has superpowers doesn't mean they won't have problems. 16. Lee did some work for Marvel's competitor, DC Comics. It was a project called \"Just Imagine...\" where he reimagined the origins of characters such as Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman. 17. In 1971, he and his team wrote an entire \"Spider-Man\" story with an anti-drugs theme. 18. He participated in an episode of the TV series \"Pawn Stars,\" where he had to verify whether an autograph on a comic strip was real. And it was. 19. One of his trademarks were surprise cameos in Marvel movies, the first of which happened in a 1989 movie called The Trial of the Incredible Hulk.\n\n21. But he also had cameos in other shows, such as \"The Simpsons,\" and \"Phineas and Ferb\". 22. At the beginning of 2018, some nurses accused him of sexual assault, according to the Daily Mail. 23.

You can find more Slumber Party posts here .\n\nLet me paint a picture that might be all-too familiar: You fall asleep quickly at night, and then, Boom! \u2014 you wake up a few hours later, and find that it's almost impossible to doze off again.\n\nA 2010 study published in Sleep Medicine found that about a third of American adults wake up during the night at least three times a week, and more than 40% of that group might have trouble falling asleep again.\n\nIf that description made you say, \"Yep, me,\" then you might have what's called sleep maintenance insomnia, a common \u2014 and really annoying \u2014 sleep issue.\n\n\"It could be caused by a lot of factors, including teeth grinding, restless legs, acid reflux, sleep apnea, snoring, a pet, overactive bladder, alcohol, or many other things,\" Dr. W. Christopher Winter, neurologist and author of The Sleep Solution , tells BuzzFeed. Add depression , aging, an overactive thyroid gland , and light pollution to the mix, and it's hard to imagine anyone who doesn't pop their eyes open in the middle of the night.\n\nBreaking the pattern starts with understanding which of these many, many causes is the culprit.\n\nSometimes, it's clear what's interrupting your beauty rest. If you find yourself rushing to the bathroom at 2 a.m., then your bladder (with the help of beverages and/or medication) is probably to blame. But other times, it feels like a mystery. Winter named a few common sleep disruptors, and how to spot them:\n\n\u2022 Restless legs: If your legs feel tired in the morning, you're wearing through your sheets, or if your sheets are pilling or folding oddly, that can be a sign of restless legs in the night. To find out if you're literally kicking yourself awake, Winter recommends wearing a Fitbit on your ankle to track your leg movements.\n\n\u2022 Sleep apnea: It's a serious disorder in which you repeatedly stop breathing, but oftentimes, you don't realize it's even happening. If you sleep in the same bed or room as someone, ask them to tell you if they notice you snoring loudly or catching your breath during the night. Waking up gasping for breath or needing to sleep with a fan on your face are also signs of sleep apnea you might notice on your own.\n\n\u2022 Teeth grinding: If someone ever tells you you make a terrible noise in your sleep that they can't describe, it could very well be teeth grinding, also known as bruxism. Ask your dentist to check for unusual signs of wear at your next appointment to figure out whether this is what's making you jolt awake during the night.\n\n\u2022 Acid reflux: Often, it's easy to tell if you have acid reflux during the day, but it can be harder to detect if it's happening in the middle of a REM cycle. Winter says if you have a distinctly funny taste in the back of your throat or horrible breath when you wake up in the middle of the night, it can be a sign of disruptive acid reflex. Acid reflux at night is particularly rough on children \u2014 Winter says that children can have almost seizure-like behavior in their sleep because of it.\n\nIf you think your sleep disruptions are related to these \u2014 or any other \u2014 medical issue, keep notes of it all and discuss it with your doctor.", "Oops.

Diferentemente dos partos sem assist\u00eancia que ocorrem durante uma emerg\u00eancia (no carro a caminho do hospital, por exemplo) ou pela falta de acesso ao sistema de sa\u00fade, os \"partos livres\" s\u00e3o uma escolha consciente. Vale ressaltar que o \"parto livre\" n\u00e3o \u00e9 o mesmo que os partos naturais em casa, que geralmente envolvem uma profissional capacitada, seja uma parteira ou doula, que \u00e9 capaz de ajudar caso uma interven\u00e7\u00e3o m\u00e9dica se fa\u00e7a necess\u00e1ria, explicou Yvonne Butler Tobah, obstetra e ginecologista em Rochester, Minnesota (EUA), para o BuzzFeed News. \"O free birth \u00e9 uma comunidade de mulheres que deseja a 'experi\u00eancia mais natural poss\u00edvel', sem interven\u00e7\u00e3o m\u00e9dica\", diz. Isso quer dizer que a gestante d\u00e1 \u00e0 luz em casa ou at\u00e9 mesmo em algum lugar remoto, muitas vezes completamente sozinha. Trata-se de uma pequena vertente. Cerca de 1% dos nascimentos nos Estados Unidos, o que corresponde a aproximadamente 35 mil, ocorrem em casa. Aproximadamente um em cada quatro desses partos s\u00e3o feitos sem assist\u00eancia, de acordo com o American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). Apesar disso, o movimento do \"parto livre\" vem se tornando cada vez mais popular nos EUA, principalmente porque a internet e as redes sociais fizeram com que esse pequeno nicho se tornasse uma grande comunidade online.\n\nJgi / Getty Images\n\nMulheres que est\u00e3o optando pelo \"parto livre\" pela primeira vez e m\u00e3es mais experientes conversam por meio de f\u00f3runs de mensagens, do Instagram e do Facebook. Inclusive, algumas compartilham v\u00eddeos e fotos dos seus partos. Um grupo privado do Facebook, chamado de Free Birth Society (\"Sociedade do Parto Livre\") tinha mais de 6 mil membros e foi permanentemente fechado no m\u00eas passado. Por\u00e9m, a Free Birth Society n\u00e3o est\u00e1 limitada somente ao Facebook \u2014 trata-se de uma empresa fundada por Emilee Saldaya, ex-doula de Los Angeles, EUA. A sociedade \u00e9 descrita como um movimento de mulheres que desejam recuperar a sua autonomia durante a gravidez e o nascimento. Al\u00e9m de um site, podcast, dois blogs e um perfil no Instagram com mais de 22 mil seguidores, a Free Birth Society oferece consultas virtuais e pacotes de treinamento que variam de 98 a 899 d\u00f3lares. A empresa tamb\u00e9m vende um curso online intitulado \"O Guia Completo Para o Parto em Casa\" por 600 d\u00f3lares. De acordo com o site, o curso prepara as mulheres para partos inesperados em casa e fornece uma \"compreens\u00e3o ampla e profunda de como \u00e9 o parto normal na quest\u00e3o fisiol\u00f3gica e o preparo para que ele aconte\u00e7a da melhor maneira poss\u00edvel\". Desde o dia 1 de novembro, a empresa permite que as mulheres se inscrevam para participar de uma rede exclusiva e paga, descrita como um ambiente mais seguro e privado, para substituir o grupo da Free Birth Society no Facebook. Saldaya fechou o grupo na rede social ap\u00f3s viralizar o relato de uma mulher que contava a morte de seu beb\u00ea no parto. A Free Birth Society n\u00e3o respondeu imediatamente \u00e0 solicita\u00e7\u00e3o do BuzzFeed News para coment\u00e1rios.\n\nA mulher em luto pela morte do filho conversou com o Daily Beast sob o pseud\u00f4nimo \"Lisa\". Ela disse que ficou em trabalho de parto por seis dias em uma parte remota do deserto da Calif\u00f3rnia antes que os m\u00e9dicos retirassem seu beb\u00ea natimorto, cujo nome era Journey Moon. Durante o per\u00edodo, ela publicou atualiza\u00e7\u00f5es no grupo do Facebook e recebeu mensagens de encorajamento \u2014 at\u00e9 que procurou ajuda m\u00e9dica ap\u00f3s sua bolsa ter estourado e ela passar a sentir muita dor por n\u00e3o conseguir urinar. \u201c[Journey Moon] faleceu devido \u00e0 uma grave infec\u00e7\u00e3o do trato urin\u00e1rio que eu desenvolvi. Estou na cama do hospital enquanto escrevo essas linhas\", postou Lisa no grupo, de acordo com o Daily Beast. Embora muitas das mulheres do grupo tenham demonstrado apoio, outras criticaram a m\u00e3e por n\u00e3o ter procurado ajuda m\u00e9dica antes \u2014 incluindo trolls que haviam se juntado secretamente \u00e0 Free Birth Society \u2014 o que fez com que a postagem fosse compartilhada fora do grupo. Algumas pessoas culparam a m\u00e3e pela morte da crian\u00e7a, chamando-a de \"assassina de beb\u00eas\", de acordo com o Daily Beast. Em 22 de outubro, Saldaya publicou um comunicado, na p\u00e1gina p\u00fablica da Free Birth Society, dizendo que fecharia permanentemente todos os quatro grupos privados na rede social. Ela disse que vinha sofrendo \"um ass\u00e9dio sem fim\" e recebido amea\u00e7as de morte. No mesmo comunicado, Saldaya negou qualquer envolvimento com o nascimento de Journey Moon, alegando que n\u00e3o aceitou nenhum pagamento da m\u00e3e, n\u00e3o ofereceu quaisquer aconselhamentos m\u00e9dicos ou disse que ela n\u00e3o deveria ir ao hospital. Saldaya declarou, no entanto, que conversou com a mulher em mensagens privadas no Facebook para oferecer palavras de apoio tanto antes quanto depois do nascimento. \"A dolorosa realidade \u00e9 que beb\u00eas podem morrer durante o nascimento em qualquer ambiente, incluindo no hospital. Todas as mulheres devem estar cientes da possibilidade de falecimento que existe para todas n\u00f3s\", escreveu Saldaya.\n\nFatcamera / Getty Images\n\nO parto sem assist\u00eancia n\u00e3o \u00e9 ilegal nos EUA e as mulheres t\u00eam o direito de decidir por conta pr\u00f3pria o que v\u00e3o fazer em rela\u00e7\u00e3o ao trabalho de parto e o nascimento. Elas tamb\u00e9m t\u00eam o direito de recusar cuidados m\u00e9dicos a qualquer momento. O consentimento informado \u00e9 exigido dos pacientes antes que os profissionais possam realizar qualquer interven\u00e7\u00e3o ou cirurgia (com algumas exce\u00e7\u00f5es, claro, em casos de emerg\u00eancia). Al\u00e9m disso, n\u00e3o \u00e9 poss\u00edvel for\u00e7ar algu\u00e9m a ter seu parto no hospital, de acordo com Butler Tobah. No entanto, h\u00e1 vezes em que os ginecologistas-obstetras n\u00e3o recomendam partos em casa, mesmo com um profissional qualificado presente \u2014 por exemplo, em casos de m\u00e3es hipertensas ou quando o beb\u00ea est\u00e1 na posi\u00e7\u00e3o errada. Nesses casos, \u00e9 mais seguro dar \u00e0 luz em um hospital ou maternidade, que s\u00e3o lugares equipados para lidar com partos de alto risco, explicou Butler Tobah. Gestantes devem sempre conversar com seus m\u00e9dicos para entender os riscos e decidir qual \u00e9 a melhor op\u00e7\u00e3o para elas e seus beb\u00eas. A maioria das mulheres que n\u00e3o t\u00eam uma gravidez de alto risco pode ter um parto vaginal, de acordo com Butler Tobah, mas \u00e9 dif\u00edcil prever o surgimento de complica\u00e7\u00f5es. As coisas podem mudar repentinamente e, caso a situa\u00e7\u00e3o se torne emergencial, \u00e9 preciso tomar decis\u00f5es r\u00e1pidas para tentar salvar a vida da m\u00e3e e do beb\u00ea. \"Na obstetr\u00edcia, temos dois pacientes, a m\u00e3e e um beb\u00ea ainda n\u00e3o nascido\", diz. Muitas interven\u00e7\u00f5es que se fazem necess\u00e1rias para que o beb\u00ea nas\u00e7a com seguran\u00e7a, como uma ces\u00e1rea de emerg\u00eancia ou o uso de f\u00f3rceps e outros equipamentos, tamb\u00e9m podem afetar a m\u00e3e \u2014 em muitos casos, de maneira negativa.\n\nQuando a realidade do parto \u00e9 diferente das expectativas da m\u00e3e, pode haver um conflito, levando a sentimentos de insatisfa\u00e7\u00e3o ou falta de confian\u00e7a. O movimento do \"parto livre\", de acordo com o site, se baseia na ideia de que h\u00e1 muito mais em rela\u00e7\u00e3o ao parto do que \u00e9 oferecido pelos obstetras tradicionais e parteiras. Em alguns casos, as mulheres sentem que o modelo m\u00e9dico deixa muito a desejar. \u00c9 importante comunicar-se adequadamente com os profissionais sobre os objetivos, riscos e poss\u00edveis resultados antes do parto. \"H\u00e1 momentos em que a comunidade m\u00e9dica como um todo, especialmente obstetras e parteiras, pode fazer um trabalho melhor ao educar pacientes sobre o que esperar e como as coisas podem mudar\", diz Butler Tobah. A m\u00e9dica tamb\u00e9m ressalta que atacar as mulheres que optaram pelo \"parto livre\" n\u00e3o ajuda em nada para uma comunica\u00e7\u00e3o saud\u00e1vel. \"Em vez de ofender as gestantes, \u00e9 importante se envolver com elas por meio de uma educa\u00e7\u00e3o \u00fatil que pode tanto trazer o empoderamento que elas desejam, quanto suprir as expectativas na hora do parto\", diz. Por exemplo, uma mulher pode querer um parto em casa sem interven\u00e7\u00f5es m\u00e9dicas, mas com medidas protetivas e uma estrat\u00e9gia caso algo d\u00ea errado. \"H\u00e1 muitas coisas que podem ser feitas para melhorar a experi\u00eancia das mulheres enquanto garantimos uma experi\u00eancia de nascimento segura\", diz Butler Tobah.", "Rich Polk / Getty Images\n\nMore info: The tour kicks off on March 18th in Albany and takes her across North America until June 18th where she'll end the tour at the iconic Madison Square Garden in NYC.

Aqui est\u00e1 a parte dif\u00edcil: voc\u00ea tem que esticar a roupa de volta ao seu tamanho original enquanto ela seca. Farrah Penn for BuzzFeed Farrah Penn for BuzzFeed Aviso: ela pode levar horas para secar. Desculpe.

O nome de batismo de Stan Lee era Stanley Martin Lieber. 2. Quando crian\u00e7a ele queria ser advogado. 3. Stan come\u00e7ou na carreira escrevendo obitu\u00e1rios para jornais, mas seu sonho era escrever grandes romances liter\u00e1rios. 4. Ele adotou o pseud\u00f4nimo Stan Lee para trabalhar com quadrinhos pois n\u00e3o queria separar esta carreira da outra que planejava como escritor de livros. 5. Anos depois ele mudou seu nome legalmente para Stan Lee. 6. O primeiro her\u00f3i que chamou a aten\u00e7\u00e3o de Stan foi o Pimpinela Escarlate, que era o nome de uma pe\u00e7a de teatro que contava a hist\u00f3ria de Percy Blakeney, que durante a Revolu\u00e7\u00e3o Francesa conseguia salvar nobres franceses da morte pela guilhotina. 7. Em 1941 ele virou editor interino da Timely Comics, que seria futuramente a Marvel Comics, aos 18 anos de idade. 8. Ele participou da Segunda Guerra Mundial. Mas sua batalha foi fazendo parte da equipe que escrevia cartazes, placas e at\u00e9 cartoons para o ex\u00e9rcito americano. Ele tinha a classifica\u00e7\u00e3o de \"dramaturgo\".\n\n15. Sua carreira ficou conhecida por dar sentimentos mais humanos a seus her\u00f3is. Segundo ele, n\u00e3o era porque uma pessoa tinha super-poderes que n\u00e3o teria problemas. 16. Lee j\u00e1 fez um trabalho para a concorrente da Marvel, a DC Comics. Era um projeto chamado \"Just Imagine...\" onde ele reimaginou as origens de personagens como Superman, Batman e Mulher-Maravilha. 17. Em 1971, ele e sua equipe escreveram uma hist\u00f3ria completa do \"Homem-Aranha\" com a tem\u00e1tica anti-drogas. 18. Ele j\u00e1 participou de um epis\u00f3dio da s\u00e9rie \"Trato Feito\" onde ia autenticar se um autografo seu em uma tirinha de um f\u00e3 que tentava vend\u00ea-la era real. E era. 19.

No come\u00e7o de 2018 algumas enfermeiras o acusaram de ass\u00e9dio sexual, segundo o Daily Mail. 23.

This can relate to genitals, reproductive organs, sex chromosomes, or sex hormones, and is distinct from being transgender, which relates to gender identity.\n\nThere are widespread concerns among intersex organisations about the way that laws, human rights, and the medical profession treat intersex children and adults.\n\nAmong these concerns is the practice of doctors performing surgery on infants to modify genitals, particularly in cases where there is no clinical need to do so, and when no informed consent has been obtained from the child.\n\nIn 2017, researchers into intersex experiences at the University of Huddersfield called for an overhaul of the medical response. \u201cSupport and training for medics \u2014 including about sex diversity issues \u2014 is required,\u201d said the report\u2019s authors. \u201cThe severe, harmful effects reported as a result of early childhood interventions need to be acknowledged.\u201d\n\nSuch operations, the study found, are generally an attempt to make genitals conform to traditional ideas of how male or female sex organs should look. A young intersex man called Anick told BuzzFeed News in 2017 that after doctors realised he was intersex, and after years of surgeries, \u201cNothing was explained to me, so at a young age I didn\u2019t know what was going on \u2014 you feel fine but you are at the hospital.\u201d\n\nSurgery on intersex children carries risks, and critics say the surgery assumes how an individual child will feel later in life. Mistakes can therefore be made, forcing children into a sex contrary to their gender identity and sense of self.\n\nA range of medical interventions that draw criticism from intersex advocates will be examined during the government\u2019s consultation.\n\nHolly Greenberry from IntersexUK told BuzzFeed News: \u201cYoung people must be afforded the basic human right to decide autonomously how they would like their body to feel and function. A child needs to be able to live healthily, happily and safely and not subject to harmful practice, sterilisations, sex assignments and other harmful practices which typically infringe horrendously on the quality of their childhood.\u201d\n\nFor doctors to \u201cguess\u201d what the gender of the child should be and give hormones or perform surgery \u201cby means of irreversible procedures without that person\u2019s consent is barbaric\u201d, Greenberry added.", "In case you didn't know, the cast of Stranger Things have spent the past few months shooting the third season of the show, due to land in the summer of next year.", "Vou contar uma coisa que acabou de acontecer comigo e com o meu pai, que eu acho que todo mundo tem que ficar sabendo.

Davey had good days. But when he had bad days he had bad, bad days,\u201d she said.\n\nShe said she feared \u201cgetting in more trouble\u201d with Walsh if she told police the truth about their relationship, saying: \u201cHe would call me a rat and a dog.\u201d\n\nEleven members of Walsh\u2019s family in Ireland submitted victim impact statements to the court, including his brothers, sister, former partners and young relatives.\n\nKalem Walsh wrote that he was \u201covercome with grief\u201d to hear of his brother\u2019s death and that it had been very hard on him.\n\n\u201cMy life will forever be altered by his absence, a part of my life will be gone forever, I am resentful of this,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis crime has changed me as a person, the seriousness and pain has made me more bitter and far less trusting. Losing David was like losing part of my world, he was always supportive of me and my ambitions.\u201d", "9.\n\nAnd this dog, who is just like ???how??? help???", "I hate to cancel. I know we made plans to get together tonight but that was two hours ago. I was younger then, and full of hope.", "\u201cI was obviously profiled the moment I was born,\" she told BuzzFeed News. \u201cMy father was a dark-skinned Aboriginal man and my mother had mental health issues.\u201d\n\nTurnbull-Roberts says the main reason she was removed from her parents\u2019 care was neglect. But she argues that neglect is in the eye of the beholder.\n\n\u201cNot everyone is born into privilege,\u201d she said. \u201cI grew up in social housing, but I grew up with aunties and uncles who were raising me as well.\u201d\n\nWhen she lived with her parents, she says she was \u201craised strong in Aboriginal culture\u201d, and it was difficult to be taken away from that.\n\nUntil she left the care system at age 18, she lived only with white families.\n\n\u201cI was really confused at one point because I had foster carers tell me, 'When you go to school don\u2019t tell people you\u2019re Aboriginal because they\u2019ll treat you differently',\u201d she said.\n\nThe National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Legal Services (NATSILS) says a law currently before NSW parliament would facilitate the forced adoption of Aboriginal children, threatening their connections with their culture.\n\nThe law would radically overhaul the child protection and adoption systems, removing the requirement for parents\u2019 consent when a guardian wants to adopt a child.\n\nIt would also put a two-year limit on a family\u2019s ability to get their child back once they are removed, before the removal becomes permanent.\n\n\n\nThe NSW government says that the law is a step towards making it easier to find permanent homes for children in care sooner.\n\nLegal groups argue that this law would disproportionately impact Aboriginal families, with NATSILS saying in a statement that it \"presents harrowing echoes of the Stolen Generations for our communities\".\n\nIn NSW, over a third of children in out-of-home care are Aboriginal, even though they only make up 3% of the population. According to Community Legal Centres NSW (CLCNSW), around 800 Aboriginal children are currently subject to guardianship orders. If the bill passes, these children could be immediately adopted without their parents\u2019 consent.\n\nCLCNSW argues that the two-year time limit is arbitrary and sets families up to fail, because systemic obstacles prevent many families from being in a position to get their kids back within that timeframe. Those obstacles include a lack of public housing and a lack of support and rehabilitation services, and are particularly challenging in regional, rural and remote areas.\n\nTurnbull-Roberts says it\u2019s these problems that need to be addressed, rather than making it easier for children to be adopted. \u201cIt comes down to fostering families, not fostering children,\u201d she said.\n\nTo make an adoption order, the court has to be satisfied that the adoption will promote the child\u2019s welfare and is in the child\u2019s best interests. But Turnbull-Roberts says that assessing whether a child is doing well at the point in time the order is sought, and removing the possibility of restoring them to their family, could cost the child dearly.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not actually just removing that child, they\u2019re removing that whole identity of that family, they\u2019re removing identity,\u201d she said. \u201cThe best interests of children come from family and communities.\u201d\n\nHazel Collins, a 62-year-old Gomeroi woman living in Gunnedah in northeastern NSW, has had four grandchildren removed from her family.

Former Greens staffer Ella Buckland filed a complaint to the party in April in which she alleged that in 2011, when she was 30, Buckingham walked up behind her outside his inner-city Sydney home and put his hands between her legs, grabbed her aggressively on the vagina and then kissed her neck. Buckland alleged the next morning Buckingham phoned her and threatened her employment with the party, a series of documents compiled in a Greens NSW workplace investigation and leaked to New Matilda last month showed. The Greens referred the complaint to an external company, WorkDynamic, which wrote a report in September that recommended the party find there is insufficient evidence to substantiate Buckland's claim. WorkDynamic recommended the Greens work with the Department of Parliamentary Services to improve induction, training and complaint procedures. Buckingham has denied these allegations.\n\nDean Lewins / AAP Jeremy Buckingham.\n\nLeong addressed Buckland in her speech on Tuesday: \"I believe you.\" \"I have known Jeremy Buckingham for close to decades,\" Leong said. \"I know what he is like. I used to consider him a friend.\" Leong claimed multiple Greens NSW volunteers had resigned over Buckingham's behaviour towards them.\n\n\"Beyond what has been articulated by Ella Buckland about how Jeremy behaved towards her, I know there have been active volunteers who have stepped aside or resigned as a result of Jeremy's behaviours,\" she said. \"While we must continue to respect the presumption of innocence, this cannot be used as a shield to protect men's violence against women.\"\n\nLeong said that on \"two occasions\", once in public and once in private at NSW parliament house, Buckingham was \"aggressive and intimidating\" towards her. \"For a male Greens MP to behave in an aggressive and intimidating matter to a female Greens MP in the heart of her own electorate when people are passing,\" Leong said. \"Jeremy you have had countless opportunities to take responsibility for this.\" Leong said the fact she \"felt compelled to wait\" and use her parliamentary privilege to speak out on this issue highlighted the \"urgent need for defamation law reform\" in NSW. Leong released a joint statement with federal Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi which called on Buckingham to \"step aside and not contest at the next election\".\n\nA joint statement from @jennyleong and I", "Six people were killed as a result of the rampage: three-month-old Zachary Matthew-Bryant; Yosuke Kanno, 25; Bhavita Patel, 33; Jess Mudie, 22; Matthew Si, 33; and Thalia Hakin, 10.\n\nA jury has found 28-year-old James Gargasoulas guilty of the murder of six people, and of recklessly injuring 27 others, when he drove at pedestrians along a busy shopping strip in Melbourne's CBD on January 20, 2017.\n\nThe car used in the rampage in January 2017\n\nAfter a five-day trial, and less than one hour of jury deliberation, Gargasoulas was found guilty of their murders and recklessly injurying 27 others during the incident.\n\nGargasoulas had pleaded not guilty to all charges.

The report stated that if global temperatures are allowed to rise to 2 degrees Celsius, \u201cvirtually all\u201d coral reefs will be lost.\n\nPeterson is particularly concerned about funding priorities in light of a federal government decision to give a small nine-person organisation nearly half a billion dollars in funding earlier this year.\n\n\u201cThis is especially stupid when the Australian Government is giving over $400 million to the inexperienced Great Barrier Reef Foundation (GBRF),\u201d said Peterson."]
