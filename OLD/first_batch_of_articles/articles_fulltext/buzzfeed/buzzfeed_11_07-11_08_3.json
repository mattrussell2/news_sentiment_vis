The proposal would not just cover pill testing for the busy music festival season, and people would be able to get their drugs tested any day of the week.\n\n\"The war on drugs is a war on people \u2014 it has destroyed thousands of lives and wasted billions of dollars,\" said Di Natale in a statement. \"Instead of protecting the community it is actually placing them at greater risk of harm.\"\n\nThe new proposal from the Greens doesn't just focus on physical testing of drugs, and includes a national drug warning system, providing online advice and information about different pill types.\n\nThe services would be set up by the Australian Drug Testing Agency, which would work with law enforcement to ensure the operation runs smoothly.\n\n\u201cOur policy will make pill testing available, easy and free at sites in communities all over the country,\u201d Di Natale said. \u201cPeople will be able to discover whether a pill they\u2019re considering taking is mixed with an unknown toxic substance, or whether they\u2019re stronger than expected.\n\n\u201cPill testing has time and time again proven to reduce rates of harm both in Australia and overseas, whereas the Coalition and Labor Party\u2019s approach of heavy handed policing with drug dogs only creates more misery.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t continue doing the same thing and expecting different results. Right now, people who consume drugs are relying on the word of their drug dealer, and that leads to tragic outcomes time and time again.\"\n\nFederal health minister Greg Hunt has repeatedly ruled out ever considering pill testing.\n\nFollowing the death of two people at the NSW music festival Defqon 1 in September, NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian sought the advice of an expert panel on how to make music festivals safer but also ruled out pill testing ever being an option.\n\nAustralia's first legal pill testing was held earlier this year at Canberra's Groovin the Moo festival.

His latest venture is no different: Benedict is taking on one of the most well-known roles in festive history as the title character in 2018\u2019s version of Dr Seuss\u2019s The Grinch. He\u2019s one of Britain\u2019s most famous faces, so when BuzzFeed UK got the opportunity to meet with Benedict while he was promoting The Grinch in London recently, we jumped at the chance to learn a little bit more about him. Here\u2019s what he revealed...\n\nBenedict Cumberbatch spilled the tea about hating his moustache, meeting President Obama, and his Christmas pet peeve https://t.co/PaijmtI1oH\n\n1. Tea or coffee? Benedict Cumberbatch: It depends what time of the day. Coffee in the morning, tea the rest of the day. 2. Puppies or kittens? BC: Puppies. 3. Which animal do you think you\u2019re most similar to?\n\nBC: An otter, clearly. 4. Have you ever been mistaken for another celebrity? BC: Yeah! Matt Smith, Eddie Redmayne. The usual. 5. What was the most exciting thing about playing the Grinch? BC: When I first heard about it, and when I saw it. I mean, everything in between was a ballache. [laughs] No, it was great. It\u2019s a dream job \u2014 it\u2019s a fantastically iconic character, and to let your full Grinch out is always good fun. I\u2019ve played a few \u2014 let\u2019s put it like this \u2014 socially awkward outsiders, I suppose, so he sort of fits into that vein. But it\u2019s just a very brilliant, immediate story about Christmas and what the very best of Christmas is, so it also has a beautiful narrative arc to it. 6. What was the most challenging thing? BC: Being Grinchy, sometimes. I mean, I\u2019ve been Grinchy when they\u2019ve said, \u201cWe need you again. We need to do some more stuff before you go on holiday after your fifth week of filming in a row.\u201d But then the minute I stepped through the doors, I always had a really, really good time doing it. 7. What\u2019s the best Christmas gift you\u2019ve ever given?\n\nBC: That\u2019s a really good question. It\u2019s not one I should answer, I don\u2019t think. I think the best presents I\u2019ve ever given have been experiences, so a hot air balloon trip, or a great meal. Just spending time with people, with the present. 8. What\u2019s the best Christmas gift you\u2019ve ever been given? BC: Well, that\u2019s unfair, I don\u2019t do bests. That\u2019d upset a lot of people, all of which will obviously be watching this interview. [laughs] But bicycles, when you\u2019re young, are pretty unforgettably cool. They give you an immediate sense of independence. 9. What is your favourite thing about Christmas? BC: Free time, family, and friends. Definitely. 10. Where\u2019s your favourite place in the world? BC: Home. Always. And that\u2019s a moveable feast. 11. Where is one place you\u2019ve never been, but would love to visit? BC: I\u2019d love to go to Mauritius or Bali or somewhere like that. I\u2019ve heard Costa Rica\u2019s amazing. A lot of South America \u2014 in fact, all of South America. I haven\u2019t been anywhere. Chile, Brazil, Argentina. I\u2019d love to visit those countries. 12. What\u2019s the weirdest thing you own?\n\nBC: The weirdest thing I own... [turns to his publicist] Publicist: The thing that used to hang from your ceiling, that you train with. BC: My TRX bands?! Karon thinks the weirdest thing I own is my TRX bands, which, for fitness freaks, is a sort of clippable band that you attach to a point in the ceiling. Those who don\u2019t know what it is think it\u2019s some kind of sex toy, but it\u2019s actually just for doing pull-ups and bicep curls using your body weight instead of weights. 13. What\u2019s your favourite pizza topping? BC: I\u2019m vegan now, sooo\u2026 A vegan cheese with some vegetables, it\u2019s great. I don\u2019t know why I did an American accent. I'm an English vegan. 14. What is your drink of choice?\n\nBC: That really depends, but I love a spicy margarita. Anything that\u2019s got a tequila base to it\u2014 We\u2019re talking alcohol? If we\u2019re talking about fizzy pop, then a light dousing of elderflower cordial with some ice and lime and fizzy water. But tequila gets me going. 15. What\u2019s your favourite drunk food? BC: Pizza, clearly. Vegan pizza. 16. What advice would you give to your younger self? BC: Don\u2019t worry. 17. What\u2019s the best piece of advice you\u2019ve ever been given? BC: Don\u2019t worry. [laughs] 18. What\u2019s the craziest fan encounter you\u2019ve ever had?\n\nBC: Meeting Barack Obama, and him saying, \u201cYou\u2019re doing great work at the moment,\u201d and just going, \u201cYou too, President of the United States of America!\u201d That was extraordinary. On the other end of the spectrum, some kids in Nepal. I was filming in Kathmandu, very bearded and disguised and looking pretty shaggy and un-Sherlocky, and these kids just immediately knew who I was. That was kind of amazing. And in a Tibetan Buddhist monastery after that, which I thought was a private meeting, and then it was all over their Facebook page. It was strange, but bless them, that was amazing. 19. Have you ever freaked out about meeting another celebrity? BC: Yeah! Buzz Aldrin! I mean, shaking the hand of a man who\u2019s walked on the moon\u2026 And Barack Obama again. He comes up quite often on the list, unsurprisingly. 20. Who\u2019s one actor you\u2019d love to work with, but haven\u2019t yet? BC: The Gosling. He\u2019d be nice to work with, I think. Matt Damon. There\u2019s a lot of actors I haven\u2019t worked with that I\u2019d like to work with \u2014 Ethan Hawke, I really like him. Ed Norton. Woody Harrelson. There\u2019s a lot of them, we could be here a long time. I can\u2019t just give one answer to that kind of question. 21. Do you have a signature dance move?\n\nBC: Yeah. The death drop, but I\u2019m not going to do it now. There\u2019s no dance music, so I can\u2019t do it. 22. What\u2019s the most challenging role you\u2019ve ever played? BC: They all are, because you end up carrying a lot if it has an impact on someone you\u2019re playing who\u2019s alive, or their relatives. Then there are fictional characters, who are loved by everyone, whether it\u2019s this or Sherlock. 23. What\u2019s the most fun you\u2019ve ever had playing a role? BC: I had a lot of fun on this. I would say that, because we\u2019re here to talk about this, but it\u2019s just brilliant when you\u2019ve got such a great script and you start seeing the animation come through. You can hang out with people and shoot the breeze and find life and everything absurd about it \u2014 especially with what we\u2019re going through at the moment \u2014 funny, and make it into something that can be enjoyed rather than depressing. That\u2019s a mark of friendship as well as anything else, and that\u2019s a great thing to have in a working collaboration. I\u2019ve been very lucky with the people that have asked me to work for them and vice versa, and this was no exception. 24. What\u2019s your biggest pet peeve?\n\nBC: Well, around Christmas time, it\u2019s the amount of plastic involved in packaging. It does with food as well. That worries me \u2014 you don\u2019t think about it in the shop so much, but once you get home and open your fridge, you\u2019re like, \u201cOh my god, I\u2019m just opening bits of plastic all the time.\u201d That really upsets me, so I\u2019m trying to get better at that in our house. It\u2019s hard \u2014 well, it\u2019s not hard, you just have to make an effort. It\u2019s very convenient, and that\u2019s the problem. 25. What was the last song that was stuck in your head? BC: [sings \u201cWind the Bobbin Up\u201d] 26. What\u2019s your go-to karaoke song? BC: That, obviously. [laughs] No, \u201cYoung Americans\u201d by David Bowie. Maybe if I\u2019m feeling a bit emo and broody, \u201cCreep\u201d by Radiohead. Never ever Queen, ever. It\u2019s far too hard \u2014 it\u2019s always the death of the karaoke night when four people think, \u201cWe can do \u2018Bohemian Rhapsody\u2019!\u201d No, you can\u2019t! They\u2019re highly skilled classical musicians doing things at the top of their game! Very rarely is that true of karaoke people. 27. What was the last film you saw?\n\nBC: First Man. Well, this actually \u2014 The Grinch \u2014 but we won\u2019t talk about that, because why should we? We\u2019re only promoting it. No, it was First Man, and I thought it was everything that cinema is capable of and elevated. I think Damien Chazelle is a genius, and I don\u2019t say that very often about anybody. It was done so tastefully that when you did get those moments of the epic, of the unbelievably huge, whether it was a Sea of Tranquility or an Earthrise, it was just so beautiful and powerful. I was really moved by it. I thought it was just brilliant. 28. What film never fails to make you cry? BC: I\u2019m a real softie when it comes to films, so anything with any amount of sentiment makes me cry at the moment. I\u2019m probably a bit sleep-deprived, that\u2019s probably why. Oh, you know what, Rust and Bone. That\u2019s a great movie \u2014 it\u2019s not that sentimental, but it\u2019s just so powerful and brilliant. That moves me every time I see it. 29.

I decided since it was time to shop for a new toaster that I would downgrade from my large 4-slice toaster to a quaint 2-slice toaster to gain some counter space. I saw this little baby on Amazon and it caught my eye, plus the price was awesome. The color and graphics are just as bright and cheery in person as it looks in this picture. The settings are pretty accurate as far as how dark or light you prefer your toast. The coolest part is that it leaves a Mickey Mouse head-shaped outline on one side of your toast. Since it totally toasts one side, it doesn't taste like untoasted bread in those areas on the other side. One thing that I don't like is that the toaster almost feels like a toy. Despite the fact that it toasts so well, it is very light and therefore a bit cheap-feeling. But having said this, I feel like this is something that I'd get used to kind of quickly.

Here's a handy guide to help you start posting today", "Peter Rae / AAPIMAGE\n\nGeoffrey Rush\u2019s lawyers have come out swinging in the final days of the high profile defamation trial between the film star and a Sydney newspaper, describing the articles about Rush's alleged inappropriate behaviour as the most \"recklessly irresponsible\" journalism an Australian court has ever seen. The actor's barrister Sue Chrysanthou told Justice Michael Wigney he should \"nail these lies\" and find the incidents alleged by Rush's accuser, 34-year-old actor Eryn Jean Norvill, never happened. Rush is suing the publishers of the Telegraph and journalist Jonathon Moran, after they published allegations in November 2017 that Rush had been accused of behaving inappropriately towards a female cast member during the 2015-16 Sydney Theatre Company (STC) run of King Lear.\n\nRush, 67, has strenuously denied the allegations. He claims publisher Nationwide News defamed him in two articles and a poster by painting him as a pervert, a sexual predator, and someone who engaged in inappropriate sexual behaviour and committed sexual assault while acting in King Lear. He also says the articles suggested his conduct was so serious that the STC pledged to never work with him again. Nationwide News argued a defence of truth based on the testimony of Norvill, who played the role of King Lear's daughter Cordelia in the production and alleges Rush sexually harassed her during the run of the play. Norvill did not participate in the stories and agreed at a late stage to testify for the Telegraph. Rush's senior barrister Bruce McClintock SC described the articles published by the Telegraph as \"the most recklessly irresponsible journalism that has come before the court, or a court in this country\". He said that the Telegraph had been told not to publish by the STC due to the effect it might have on Norvill, who was \"fragile\" and did not want the complaint aired, and they had also been given a strong denial by Rush\u2019s lawyers. \"Did they care? Did they think about what they were doing? The answer is clearly no,\" he said. \"This article is an example of reckless and indeed cruel irresponsibility.\" Chrysanthou told the court the case was not just about Norvill's word against Rush, but her word against documents, cast members who gave evidence, the \"sea of absent witnesses\", and even her own testimony, which Chrysanthou said was \"rife with contradictions, inconsistencies and recent invention\". On Wednesday, Nationwide News barrister Tom Blackburn SC argued Norvill was a \"fundamentally honest witness\" who had wanted the complaint she made about Rush to an STC employee in April 2016 kept confidential.\n\n\"The only evidence Your Honour has about Miss Norvill\u2019s motive [to lie] is that she didn\u2019t have one,\" he said. \"She desperately, desperately wanted to stay out of the limelight. Her concern was, as she said, to make sure it didn\u2019t happen again.\"\n\n\n\nDan Himbrechts / AAPIMAGE Eryn Jean Norvill.\n\nChrysanthou said Norvill's motive was \"irrelevant\", asking: \"Why should we spend days putting to Miss Norvill what we think her motive is?\" \"What could possibly be her motive to lie? Who cares? ... It has nothing to do with anything. People lie. We don\u2019t know why,\" she said. On the witness stand last week Norvill told the court about an alleged incident in which Rush had made groping gestures over her body as they rehearsed the final scene of the play, in which he, as King Lear, grieves over the body of Cordelia.\n\nShe said she had been lying on the floor of the rehearsal room with her eyes closed when she heard \u201ctitters of laughter\u201d around her. \"I opened my eyes and Geoffrey was kneeling over me and he had both of his hands above my torso and he was gesturing stroking up and down my torso and gesturing groping or cupping above my breasts,\" she said. Norvill also alleged that Rush regularly made gestures towards her to imitate groping her breasts or tracing the curve of her hips in the rehearsal room, and that he told her she looked \"scrumptious\" and \"yummy\". Of these allegations, Chrysanthou said: \u201cHer evidence makes no sense whatsoever and the reason it makes no sense whatsoever is because it\u2019s a complete lie.\" Chrysanthou said there was \"not one person called\" to give evidence about Norvill's allegations that Rush regularly harassed her in the rehearsal room, and that it was \"rubbish\" to argue that generational differences accounted for some members of the cast not thinking there was anything wrong with the alleged behaviour. She cited evidence given by director Neil Armfield and actors Robyn Nevin and Helen Buday, saying that each of them testified if they had seen Rush doing the things Norvill alleges, \"they would have done something about it\". There was simply \"no room\", Chrysanthou said, for the possibility that some people thought the alleged behaviour was OK and others did not.\n\nShe urged Wigney to not just find the Telegraph had failed to prove the rehearsal room incidents happened, but said he should go beyond that and find that they did not occur at all. Wigney pointed out she didn't have to go that far to win the case, just to persuade him the burden of proof hadn't been met. Chrysanthou replied: \"Your Honour should nail these lies.\" She ran through a number of contradictions between Norvill's evidence and an email sent by STC employee Annelies Crowe, saying Norvill had \"told so many false stories she can\u2019t keep them straight\". She also said Norvill's account of Rush stroking the small of her back on two occasions before he carried her onstage for the grieving scene, and the second time it happened asking him very softly to \"please stop that\", did not add up. \"Why would he do it twice, over 56 performances? Why would he?\" Chrysanthou said. She said Rush had testified, unchallenged, that the scene was a hugely important one and that if there was any unpleasantness or tension between himself and Norvill that it would have ruined his concentration.\n\nFederal Court The text.\n\n\"This is another bizarre contradiction in their case,\" Chrysanthou said. \"The scene wasn\u2019t ruined, it ran like clockwork. And she didn\u2019t say 'stop that' because he didn\u2019t do anything.\" Chrysanthou also put to Wigney that there was \"nothing inappropriate\" about a text Rush sent to Norvill in mid 2016, particularly in the context of the way the pair communicated in other texts and emails.\n\nThe text included the line \"I've been thinking about you (as I do more than is socially appropriate)\" followed by a winking emoji with its tongue poking out. The text has played a relatively major role in the trial, with the parties at odds as to whether the emoji indicates \"panting\" (according to the Telegraph) or someone being \"crazy\" or \"loony\" (according to Rush). \"If you type \"crazy\" into your phone that\u2019s the emoji that comes up,\" Chrysanthou told Wigney, who replied that he wasn't sure if he could, legally, take that as a fact in the case. \"I won\u2019t be putting panting into my search engine or indeed affixing emojis to any of my texts anymore,\" he added. Earlier on Thursday, Wigney told Blackburn that his argument about the articles including strong denials from Rush had \"considerable merit\", but the addition of headlines, photos and puns are \"very large puffs of smoke suggesting there\u2019s a fire\". \"They just can\u2019t help themselves with their bad puns. Bad pun is probably putting it in mild terms,\u201d Wigney said of the Telegraph's sub-editors. \"Your Honour is not a newspaper editor, obviously,\" Blackburn said. Blackburn also argued that the \"King Leer\" headline on the first article did not make Rush out to be a pervert, which he described as someone who engages in sexual behaviour that is deviant, bizarre and disgusting. \"One can strongly disapprove of the act of leering, but it just strains the English language to call it a perversion,\" he said.

Just before she was due to compete at the Commonwealth Games this year Malone says she caught a barbell \u201ca little bit wrong\u201d. \u201cAn hour later I had this like egg on my collarbone and it was black,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m lucky I didn\u2019t break it.\u201d Malone\u2019s relationship with her body has only improved since she left gymnastics, \u201cwhere there is an expectation to be small\u201d, for weightlifting, \u201cwhere I know my body is serving a purpose and it is a rare thing and I may as well embrace it\u201d. \u201cI walked into a [CrossFit] gym where there were girls who looked exactly like me and they were being praised for it,\u201d she says. The continued crackdown on drugs is important for her sport, she says. \u201cYou\u2019re now going to see a lot more natural athletes coming out of countries that haven\u2019t excelled in weightlifting before, and it is paving a way for the media to see that we don\u2019t all have beards and moustaches and we\u2019re just normal athletic girls who can lift really heavy weights.\u201d\n\nEmily Chancellor, Rugby Union Ryan Pierse / Getty Images\n\nRugby player Emily Chancellor had always been a netballer, but when she got an email from her university about joining a women\u2019s rugby team, she thought: \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be kinda cool to learn how to tackle, like just to know that you could get someone to the ground?\u201d\n\n\n\nRyan Pierse / Getty Images\n\nSix years later, Chancellor has represented the Wallaroos, Australian women's national rugby union team, and she doesn\u2019t hesitate at all when tackling. \u201cIf you tiptoe around or you just go through the process of contact, you actually are at higher risk of getting injured, and you\u2019ve just gotta go at 100% and it hurts less,\u201d she says.\n\nChancellor has had her fair share of injuries. She broke her foot last year, tearing a ligament between her first and second toes. \u201cTwo surgeries and six months later, I\u2019m back.\u201d The recovery has been \u201cslow\u201d, \u201cmentally exhausting\u201d and \u201cdraining\u201d. \u201cIt makes you challenge every sort of concept of why you play the sport, but I think it\u2019s also a great opportunity to be able to reflect on why you do it, and do you really wanna do it, and the answer was pretty simple and it\u2019s \u2018yes\u2019.\u201d Chancellor is excited about the future of her sport, and Australia\u2019s bid to host the 2021 Women\u2019s Rugby World Cup. \u201cI think that women in the last couple of years playing rugby have really destroyed the misconception that women can\u2019t play a contact sport,\u201d she says. \u201cThe girls at the Olympics proved that women can play a great spectacle of rugby. \u201cI appreciate that girls are a different body shape, and there\u2019s been a different role, but in today\u2019s society I think that women really are proving that they can do everything that men can on the same level, in the workplace and on a sporting field.\u201d\n\nGrace Stewart, Hockey Ryan Pierse / Getty Images\n\nGrace Stewart plays for Australia\u2019s national field hockey team, the Hockeyroos, and represented the nation at the 2016 Summer Olympics when she was just 18. She says she is lucky she hasn\u2019t had any \u201creal\u201d injuries.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if you know in hockey but the ball\u2019s pretty hard, so I\u2019ve lost a tooth and had a few stitches in my face,\u201d the 21-year-old tells BuzzFeed News. \u201cBut then yeah, straight back into training, nothing different.\u201d Stewart has been playing the sport since she was five years old and moved her whole life from the South Coast of New South Wales thousands of kilometres west to Perth, Western Australia. \u201cI have to leave behind all my family and friends, which I guess is your main support network, which is pretty important in elite sport with the pressure and stuff that comes along with it,\u201d she says. Stewart trains five days a week, focusing on her legs, which she says are her \u201cbase\u201d as a hockey player. \u201cI\u2019m training to be the best I can in my sport. I\u2019m building my body up to help me perform best so I focus on that rather than looking good.\u201d Earlier this year the International Hockey Federation signed a five-year deal with Fox Sports Australia, which is a big win for the visibility for women\u2019s hockey in Australia, Stewart says. \u201cWe\u2019re actually going to be on TV for once, which is exciting.\u201d\n\nDanielle Prince, Rhythmic Gymnastics Ryan Pierse / Getty Images\n\nRhythmic gymnast Danielle Price says apart from the odd black eye and chipped tooth, most of her injuries have been from overuse while training for, and competing in, the Commonwealth Games, Olympic Games and seven world gymnastics championships. \u201cProbably the worst injury I\u2019ve had is a tear in my hip socket that helps hold my femur in place,\u201d she says. \u201cIn rhythmic gymnastics we have hypermobile high extension shapes, so it\u2019s from constantly putting your leg up by your head where it\u2019s not meant to be.\u201d She trains six days a week: \u201cWe train about 30 hours a week for just gymnastics-specific training and then on top of that we have pilates, strength and conditioning, fitness and swimming.\u201d Price is 26 \u2013 \u201csomewhat of a grandma for rhythmic gymnastics\u201d \u2013 and has spent much of the 16 years navigating how to feel OK in a leotard.\n\nRyan Pierse / Getty Images\n\n\n\n\u201cYour relationship with your body definitely changes as you go through puberty and you become a woman and you\u2019re told that\u2019s not acceptable,\u201d she says. \u201cThe amount of times I\u2019ve been told that I have to lose 10 kilos by the time we have an event. \u201cFor me it\u2019s just constantly about checking in with my body, making sure I\u2019m eating well and sleeping and also doing all of my physio, massage, constant tender love and care.\u201d\n\nPrice is excited to eventually \u201cstep onto the other side of the carpet\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhen I finish competing [I want] to raise and support and nurture my own group of athletes I could one day take to the Olympics or Commonwealth Games,\u201d she says. \u201cI guess my passion is trying to not fix, but maybe change a little bit, some of the experiences that I had as a younger athlete, particularly about my body, the way we trained, the way we were treated in training, and to try and change that to make the experiences for the next generation of girls really positive.\u201d\n\nKristiana Manu'a, Netball Ryan Pierse / Getty Images\n\nGiants netballer Kristiana Manu\u2019a ruptured her achilles tendon in 2016.\n\n\u201cI turned around to see who kicked me and there was no-one there,\u201d the 23-year-old tells BuzzFeed News. It was a 12-month rehab process: \u201cIt was really hard. Getting to know my body and what I had to do to get back out onto the court was probably the toughest part.\u201d Manu\u2019a is now training five to six times a week, running, weightlifting, boxing and playing on court, but still finds the sport mentally challenging due to the constant criticism and feedback. \u201cFrom your circle, your teammates, your coaching staff,\u201d she says. \u201cI think it varies and it\u2019s definitely hard to stay strong and really take it onboard.\u201d Manu\u2019a started playing netball for fun, as a way of staying active and spending time with her friends, but by the end of high school she realised this was something she could pursue as a career.\n\nShe would have told her younger self that if she kept working hard, it would all eventually fall into place. \u201cJust to stick your head down and keep grinding and things will work out,\u201d she says. Women\u2019s sport is growing and thriving in Australia, Manu\u2019a says. \u201cI think the introduction of AFL Women\u2019s and the Rugby League Women\u2019s have definitely shown like the physical aspects of women\u2019s sport,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd the [increased] exposure of netball as well just really shows that we are athletes before we\u2019re anything else.\u201d\n\nEmma Nedov, Artistic Gymnastics Ryan Pierse / Getty Images\n\nArtistic gymnast Emma Nedov also knows what it is like to rupture an achilles. \u201cI was just tumbling, training as normal, and as I took off for a double back [flip] it just snapped as I jumped,\u201d the 22-year-old, who has also had keyhole surgeries in both her knees, tells BuzzFeed News.\n\nRyan Pierse / Getty Images\n\n\u201cI have a screw in my little finger, I\u2019ve dislocated my elbow, tore ligaments all over my ankles, yeah, stuff like that.\u201d Gymnastics isn\u2019t a contact sport but Nedov says she has a lot of contact \u201cwith the floor or with the apparatus\u201d. \u201cIf you miss a bar, you\u2019re landing splat on the floor,\u201d she says. \u201cThe mats might look soft but they\u2019re really not that soft when you\u2019re coming from five metres off the ground.\u201d Nedov has learnt the hard way just how interconnected parts of her body are and how a foot injury can then cause a back injury.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve also learnt that in my training if something doesn\u2019t feel right, to trust myself completely,\u201d she says. \u201cAs you get older it\u2019s really important to be intuitive with your body.\u201d", "At least 4,914 same-sex couples have been married in Australia since the law changed in December 2017, BuzzFeed News can reveal. Following last year's postal survey on same-sex marriage and parliament then legislating to allow same-sex couples to marry, couples have been racing down the aisle to tie the knot. There is no central collection point for the number of weddings held in Australia, but BuzzFeed News asked each state and territory for the data on same-sex marriages.\n\n\n\nGetty/BuzzFeed News\n\nNSW, Australia's most populous state, had the most number of same-sex weddings, with 1,552 as of mid-September; followed by Victoria with 1,268 as of the end of October.\n\nQueensland was third with 1,094 as of the end of October. Western Australia was fourth with 423 as of the end of September, followed by South Australia with 312 as of the end of October, the ACT with 112 according to the latest data, Tasmania with 108 as of the end of September, and Northern Territory with 45 as of the end of October. The 2016 Australian Census showed there were 46,800 same-sex couples living together in Australia. This means over 10% of same-sex couples in Australia got married in the year since same-sex marriage became legal. For perspective, in NSW there were almost 26,000 marriages in the same period, meaning that same-sex marriages accounted for 6% of the total.\n\nOrbon Alija / Getty Images", "O jogador foi encontrado em um matagal na cidade de S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 dos Pinhais, regi\u00e3o metropolitana de Curitiba, quase degolado e sem os genitais.\n\nCaso voc\u00ea n\u00e3o tenha interesse em ler not\u00edcias do tipo, eu estou aqui pra resumir e comentar sobre o caso de Daniel Corr\u00eaa, um ex-jogador do S\u00e3o Paulo que foi brutalmente assassinado no final do m\u00eas passado.\n\nNa \u00faltima noite em que o jogador foi visto, sexta-feira (26), ele teria ido ao anivers\u00e1rio de 18 anos de Allana Brittes em uma boate.

Tambourines jangled, worshipers worshiped, and I thought to myself, What a perfect prelude to an interview with her holiness Jamila Woods!\n\n\n\nIf you're not already familiar with the Chicago songstress-poet, then open up whatever you use to listen to music, search \"Jamila Woods,\" and play her 2017 debut album HEAVN as you read the rest of this profile. Because to read about Jamila's rich tone and vivid word play is one thing, but to actually hear and feel those gifts? An entirely different story. No, not a story, a testimony \u2014 a testimony to us black girls and our supernatural shrinkage (\"Bubbles\") and our hand-clapping games and our can't stop, won't stop activism (\"VRY BLK\") and our radical self-love (\"Holy\") and our revolutionary strength (\"Blk Girl Soldier\") and our undeniable magic (\"Giovanni\"). The subject matter resonates, like getting \"the nod\" from a sister stranger, and yet there's ample space to tailor each lyric's intricate narrative to your own life \u2014 to just breathe and be seen. And so during our interview that Sunday, Jamila sat very still in the bedroom of an airy AirBnb apartment, preparing to spin yet another intimate world for her devout fans at AFROPUNK. A bunch of cosmetics cluttered the table to her left and before her crouched celebrity makeup artist Delina Medhin. The two had met on Instagram after Delina responded to Jamila's call for a woman or non-binary makeup artist of color. \"It's so crazy how that can just work really well,\" Jamila told me. \"Just putting it out there, what you need.\"\n\n\n\nBut does the universe actually conspire in helping us get what we want? I'm not sure, but if it were to collaborate with someone, I've no doubt it'd be this powerful 28-year-old who sprinkled quotable gems throughout our interview with the same ease that she sports a stunning low cut and bold canary lids. Let me back up though, to the moment Delina peeled a damp white sheet mask from Jamila's smooth brown face, freeing up her mouth to move and our discussion on beauty to begin.\n\nWhat's the look for Afropunk today? Do we know yet?\n\n\n\nJamila: Today we're doing like a pop of color on the eyes... Delina: The look is going to be very minimal with foundation. We're not going to put a lot of product on her skin. And because [she's] going to be so far away from [the cameras], and it's going to be such a big screen, I really want to make sure she looks contoured. Not in a way where it's a lot, but just so you can really see definition in her face. It's more going to be about the pop of color on the eye. We have some yellow that we're going to use all over the lid. I'm going to layer it with a cream, and then we're gonna put on powder to set it.\n\n\n\nJamila: The color yellow just always feels like a really fun summer color. And it's the perfect contrast to the black leather and spandex material I'll be wearing today. To mix yellow with that, it represents my personalities and incorporates that range in my music, from bubbly sounds to more darker sounds.\n\n\n\nChantal Follins/EllieSunakawa/BuzzFeed Celebrity makeup artist Delina Medhin brings to life the that look she and Jamila brainstormed earlier via email and text.\n\nYou had mentioned that you were looking for a specific kind of makeup artist for Afropunk. Why is that?\n\nJamila: I just feel like when you're talented at makeup, you should be able to work with all kinds of skin colors. But that's just not the case. I just have had really bad experiences, particularly doing photoshoots and they're like, \"Oh we'll have a makeup person\" and then it's like a white person who doesn't really get my skin color right. So I just like to make sure that I reach out to a person of color.\n\nEllieSunakawa/BuzzFeed\n\nI was on Instagram last night and your photo came up. It was the debut of your haircut! Could you talk about the new look?\n\n\n\nI'd been thinking about cutting my hair for a little bit. I'd see someone with short hair and be like, \"Ooh, I want to do it.\" But it had taken me years to get my afro as big as it was. It was my identifying factor, the thing I loved the most. I kind of relied on my hair a lot. But I just felt this inertia like, \"No I need to cut it now.\" Cutting it off was almost like asking, \"What else can I love? What else can be my favorite thing?\" So yeah, it feels nice. I didn't realize how warm my afro was keeping me though. I was like, \"Oh, my head is so cold!\"\n\n\n\nWhere did you get it cut?\n\nI go to this salon called Amazon Natural Look Academy. It's a natural hair school and a salon. There's this barber there named Kojo. He's really cool. He used to cut Common's hair apparently.\n\nI feel like hair has played a major role in a lot of your work...\n\nYeah, I'm really inspired by black hair in general. It's just a great metaphor for so many things. For a while I've been writing poems that are all inspired by black hair, and I think it just bleeds into my lyrics naturally. It just shows up, like in the song \"Bubbles,\" [which is about] this time I hadn't really been taking care of my hair and hadn't combed it out in a really long time and so there was shrinkage. When I finally combed it out it had grown like double the length, way longer than I had expected. To me it was a metaphor for how you can't see your growth if you're scrunching yourself and not actually looking at yourself for however long. It was just a moment where I was like, \"Oh I actually am making progress. I actually am growing, I just haven't been looking at myself to see it.\"\n\n\n\nTap to play GIF Tap to play GIF Jagjaguwar via Youtube, Warner Chappell, EMI Music via Youtube.\n\nHow do you prioritize your physical appearance as an artist and as a black woman in the music industry?\n\nYeahhh...(Laughs) I think a lot of times women, especially women of color and women in positions of power or visibility, feel this pressure to just always be on and always be presenting a certain way. That's why I liked seeing Jessie Reyez yesterday [at AFROPUNK Day 1], she was like, \"I'm in a white T-shirt, I don't care how my hair looks, y'all gon' get this message.\" I really feel that. I think I had to, at some point, make it an internal process, and not pressure myself to always look good leaving the house. But I do love the process of learning how to make my hair look good and how to take care of it. Doing a wash and twist-out would take me like two hours and that's two hours of self-care time that I wouldn't have spent otherwise. So I kind of treat it as a sign that I am dedicating time to myself, as opposed to being like, \"Oh, I'm going to look bad if I don't do this.\" Because there have definitely been times where I didn't have two hours and I had to just be like, \"Okay, I'm gonna have to spray some water and pull it a little bit.\" I remember Princess Nokia was on tour and I was going to her concert. She was like, \"Oh, why don't you come out and we'll sing Blink 182 together?\" I was like, \"I would have done a twist-out if I knew I was gonna go on stage!\" But I just ended up just doing that water-and-pull situation and it was cool. I don't like having to feel like I need to do something. I challenge that feeling when it comes up in me, because it does come up a lot. I can only do so much though because I also work at Young Chicago Authors, the non-profit where I grew up writing poetry, and I am just always really busy. So I'm just trying to not be to hard on myself or beat myself up over things.\n\nEllieSunakawa/BuzzFeed\n\nWho are some of your style and beauty icons?\n\nI just saw the Betty Davis documentary, have you? It's hard to see. I don't know how many times it's been screened, but I love her. I love Betty Davis. I remember when I first learned about her \u2014 I was reading the Miles Davis biography \u2014 and just learned how her relationship with him helped him evolve and change his whole style. Then, I looked at a picture of her and was just like, \"Wow!\" She's the most beautiful person I've ever seen. Just a huge afro and her amazing body suits. The thing about her is she was making music in the 70's and influenced so many people who are icons now. She influenced Prince and I think Madonna, every type of music. Just thinking about Beyonce's body suit, I feel like Betty's body suits were the precursor to those. I just love that. Betty called herself an introvert, but then would have this transformation on stage. People would say, \"Oh, you're one Betty off stage and you're one Betty on stage.\" And she's like, \"No, there's one Betty and I just have multitudes.\" That's really inspiring to me.\n\nJust Sunshine Records, Light In The Attic, Columbia, Island Records\n\nThere's no doubt that Chicago influences your sound. How does your hometown inspire your sense of style and beauty?\n\nChicago is amazing. There are a lot of genres of art in Chicago and a lot of people just have kind of a DIY attitude towards things. There's not really an industry for fashion or for music, like we don't have a structure, so we're just making our own sort of thing. It's a lot of collaborative energy. So I love discovering what local designers are making. My band is going to be wearing shirts by an artist named Des. I love his work because it incorporates a lot of Chicago pride, but he also just went to Ghana where he's from and did a whole line kind of mixing the two styles of Chicago and Ghana. And he has a shirt that says, \"Chicago Girls Do It Better.\" I love it. I just really like getting inspired by what I see people around me making. We try to wear a lot of Chicago designers all the time.\n\nChantal Follins/EllieSunakawa/BuzzFeed Wardrobe manager Whitney Middleton steams Jamila's performance outfit.\n\nSo who are some Chicago beauty and style influencers and creators that you're loving right now?\n\nI love the Eugene Taylor brand. The designer's name is Tesha [Renee] and her new line is unisex and just really colorful and unique. She made me this custom piece that I wore on tour a lot. She also does these really cool sort of underboob cut-out shirts with super long sleeves. Every time I wear it, people are like, \"Where'd you get that from?\" I really like her and the way her mind works. I don't have very long nails, but there's this nail artist named Spifster, who I've always wanted to work with. Her nail art is so cool, because she can take inspiration. If I told her I really love Betty Davis, she'd probably create something that looked like her outfit looks like on my nails. We keep missing each other, but it's going to come together at the right moment.\n\nThere's this store called Koko Rokoko, and it's kind of like a vintage store. They have a lot of stuff that's pretty affordable and they have amazing denim.\n\nThere's designer Chelsey Carter of Alex Carter. She's doing a series called Hues where she makes mini collections out of different colors. She started with black, which I wear a lot of, so I'm really excited about the rest of the series.\n\n\n\nThen there's Fat Tiger Works, Jugrnaut, and Leaders 1354, which are sort of like hip hop gear shops. There's a lot of businesses that are doing really well in Chicago, so I like to see what I can create on stage, like what's the whole band wearing? Often I'll get t-shirts or something from there to just give [my show] a Chicago feeling. Like, \"Chicago Til The World Blow Up\" was on one [shirt]. Juggernaut had a shirt that says, \"Chicago Everywhere\". Just a lot of Chicago pride is what I like to incorporate.\n\n\n\nMaya Iman/EllieSunakawa/BuzzFeed Jamila takes the stage at Afropunk 2018 in her final look.\n\nBONUS: Watch Jamila get glam for her Afropunk debut!", "11.\n\nThe only way to know a new generation has begun:", "tasty\n\nPor\u00e7\u00f5es: 10\n\nVoc\u00ea vai precisar de:\n\n100g de a\u00e7\u00facar cristal, divididos\n\n645ml de \u00e1gua, divididos\n\n2 colheres de sopa de \u00e1gua quente\n\n80g de gelatina\n\n12g de \u00e1gar-\u00e1gar\n\n3,2L de leite, divididos\n\n18 ovos m\u00e9dios\n\n3 gotas de ess\u00eancia de baunilha\n\nChantili, para decorar\n\nFrutas em fatias, como morangos, mirtilos, kiwi e laranja, para decorar\n\nEquipamento especial\n\nBalde de metal de 15 litros\n\nModo de preparo:\n\n1.

He claims publisher Nationwide News defamed him in two articles and a poster by painting him as a pervert, a sexual predator who committed sexual assault while acting in King Lear, and by suggesting his conduct was so serious that the STC pledged to never work with him again.\n\n\n\nNationwide News has argued a defence of truth based on the testimony of Norvill, who played the role of King Lear's daughter Cordelia in the production. Norvill did not participate in the stories and agreed at a late stage to testify for the Telegraph.\n\nAt the start of his closing argument on Wednesday morning, Nationwide News barrister Tom Blackburn SC told Justice Michael Wigney: \"At the end of the day, your honour has to make a choice between the evidence of Miss Norvill and the evidence of Mr Rush on the crucial points.\"\n\nHe described Norvill, an Australian theatre and TV actor, as a \"fundamentally honest witness\" who had wanted the complaint she made about Rush to an STC employee in April 2016 kept confidential.\n\n\"She made an informal complaint,\" Blackburn said. \"She didn\u2019t want Mr Rush notified and she didn\u2019t tell the media. Your Honour might think there is absolutely nothing in these proceedings for Miss Norvill except distress and anxiety.\n\n\"She wasn\u2019t seeking publicity for herself. She wasn\u2019t seeking vengeance for Mr Rush. She was just concerned it wouldn\u2019t happen to anybody else.\"\n\nHe said Norvill had responded with \"dignified restraint\" to an accusation from Rush\u2019s barrister Bruce McClintock SC that she had told \"a pack of disgusting lies\" about Rush.\n\n\"The only evidence Your Honour has about Miss Norvill\u2019s motive [to lie] is that she didn\u2019t have one,\" he said. \"She desperately, desperately wanted to stay out of the limelight. Her concern was, as she said, to make sure it didn\u2019t happen again.\"\n\nNorvill, who spent two days on the stand, alleges Rush traced his hand across the side of her breast as they acted out a scene in which Rush, as King Lear, is grieving the body of his daughter Cordelia.\n\nShe also said he rubbed the small of her back on occasions before they entered the stage for that scene, that he made gestures towards her to imitate groping her breasts or tracing her hips in the rehearsal room, and that he said she looked \u201cscrumptious\u201d and \u201cyummy\u201d.\n\nRush, who testified over two and a half days, strongly denied all but one accusation, saying he \u201cmight have\u201d said to Norvill that she looked \"yummy\".\n\nLast week, cast member Mark Winter supported parts of Norvill\u2019s testimony, with some discrepancies \u2013 he said he saw Rush touch her left breast, while Norvill said it was her right.\n\nJustice Michael Wigney said he was \"grappling\" with the different versions, and that it was \"not so much\" the fact it was the wrong breast, but that Mr Winter\u2019s version of events would require Rush\u2019s arm stretching across Norvill\u2019s body.\n\n\"He'd almost have to be a contortionist to do it,\" Wigney said. \"It goes to the reliability of [Mr Winter's] recollection.\"\n\nWigney, who stressed that he had not formed a view and was testing Blackburn's submissions, also questioned whether Rush would do something as \"extraordinary and potentially destructive\" as deliberately groping Norvill\u2019s breast in front of an audience given his \"intense approach to acting\".\n\n\"The thought of him doing this in front of 900 people and perhaps destroying this part of the play, I just find bizarre,\" he said.\n\nNorvill was cross-examined at length on the stand over discrepancies between her evidence and an email sent by Annelies Crowe, the STC employee she made a complaint to.\n\n\u201cMiss Norvill and Miss Crowe met at a pub in Annandale in April [2016], they had dinner and they drank a lot,\u201d Blackburn told the court. \u201cThe meeting went for several hours. The reality is Miss Crowe\u2019s email was obviously sent the next day after a night out drinking, she took no notes.\u201d\n\nHe said that parts of the email were consistent with Norvill\u2019s evidence and that she had rejected other parts of it on the stand, including an assertion that Rush had followed her into the bathroom at the cast afterparty.\n\nIf Norvill had some \"ill-identified motive for telling a pack of lies\", Blackburn said, she would have gotten in the witness box and \"beefed up\" her story. \"Her refusal to do so is an indication of just how honest she is,\" he said.\n\nBlackburn also had a lengthy exchange with Wigney on the relevance of Norvill\u2019s evidence that Rush told her she looked \"scrumptious\" and \"yummy\".\n\nWigney said \"context is everything\" and that he was grappling with the significance of the evidence in isolation.\n\n\"I wouldn\u2019t say yummy and scrumptious to anyone in my workplace, but I\u2019m a boring lawyer, and Mr Rush is an actor in a theatrical workplace where people use florid language,\" Wigney said.\n\nBlackburn argued that whether or not it was said at the same time as Rush\u2019s alleged gestures towards Norvill was irrelevant, and it\u2019s the \"totality of that conduct that needs to be considered\".\n\nWigney also questioned the \"generational\" issues present in the case, saying \"I don\u2019t think I\u2019d use the word scrumptious in any context, not even to describe food\" but that an older person might.\n\nWhat one person considers inappropriate may not be inappropriate to someone else, he suggested to Blackburn, who replied that these are \"quintessentially jury questions\".\n\nThe Rush trial is judge-alone. Wigney said there was a prospect for juries in Federal Court defamation cases when they involve \"social norms\".\n\n\"I think this is such a case,\" he said.\n\n\"Well anyway, we haven\u2019t got one,\" said Blackburn.\n\n\"That\u2019s true,\" said Wigney.\n\nThe trial continues.", "Did you know you can sign up for a BuzzFeed Community account and create your own BuzzFeed posts?
